The U.S. economy could run out of fuel. We could experience\nunexpected turbulence. In�ation could level o� at a cruising altitude higher than our\n2 percent target. And the landing could be delayed as the U.S. economy continues to\ndefy expectations.\n• Is in�ation continuing its descent and is the broader economy continuing to �y\nsmoothly? Conviction on both questions will determine the pace and timing of any\nchanges in rates. There’s no autopilot. The data that come in this year will matter.\n\nThanks for that nice introduction. I really enjoy kicking o� the new year with an audience\nlike this. It gives me an excuse to re�ect on the prior year and a reason to lay out my\nperspective on the year ahead. So, that’s what I’ll try to do today. I caution these are my\nthoughts alone and not those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. I look forward\nto your questions and input.\nYou know the big picture. In�ation spiked coming out of the pandemic, and if there is one\nthing we’ve relearned in the last few years, it is that everybody hates in�ation. High in�ation\ncreates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it becomes unclear when to spend, when to\nsave or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It takes e�ort to shop around for better\nprices or to handle complaints from unhappy customers. And in�ation feels unfair — the\nwage increase you earned feels arbitrarily taken away at the gas pump.\nThe Fed is the agency charged with keeping in�ation in line, so we stepped in aggressively.\n\n\fWe raised the federal funds rate over 5 percentage points in an 18-month period. We\nshrunk our balance sheet by over a trillion dollars. And we made crystal clear our resolve to\ndo what’s necessary to return in�ation to our 2 percent target.\nWe’re making real progress. Twelve-month PCE in�ation is down to 2.6 percent. Core is at\n3.2 percent. Six-month core in�ation is even lower, now just below our target at 1.9\npercent. Contrary to most predictions, the economy has remained healthy as in�ation has\nfallen. And that’s despite a number of shocks that could have proved destabilizing, like the\nbank turmoil in March or the escalation of the Gaza con�ict in October. GDP growth in 2023\nis estimated to be around 2.5 percent. The unemployment rate remains at a historically low\n3.7 percent. Frankly, if early last year you had o�ered me 2.6 percent in�ation and 3.7\npercent unemployment by year end, I would have taken it.\nFor sure, we got some help. Consumer demand has remained resilient, buoyed by excess\nsavings, strong employment, high asset prices and continued elevated demand for\nexperiences post-lockdown. Business investment has been supported by an AI-fueled data\ncenter boom and bills such as the CHIPS Act. The painful post-pandemic labor shortage\nmade employers reluctant to let workers go. And the supply side recovered nicely. Supply\nchain challenges eased. Domestic oil production rebounded. Prime-age labor force\nparticipation rose. And immigration stepped back up.\nNow, everyone is talking about the potential for a soft landing, where in�ation completes its\njourney back to normal levels while the economy stays healthy. And you can see the case\nfor that. Demand, employment and in�ation all surged but now seem to be on a path back\ntoward normal. GDP growth, which was 5.8 percent in 2021, is now estimated to be 2.5\npercent, closing in on its trend rate of just under 2 percent. Three-month average job\ngrowth, which hit 708,000 in 2021, is now 204,000, moving toward its breakeven pace of\nroughly 100,000. And in�ation, which was 7.1 percent in June 2022, is now at 2.6 percent,\ncoming into range of our 2 percent target.\n\nThe airport is on the horizon. But landing a plane isn’t easy, especially when the outlook is\nfoggy, and headwinds and tailwinds can a�ect your course. It’s easy to oversteer and do too\nmuch or understeer and do too little. I see four big �ight risks.\nFirst, the U.S. economy could run out of fuel. Last year, we raised rates to put the brakes on\nthe economy, but we didn’t end up losing as much altitude as we might have thought.\nCredit conditions tightened but didn’t make the economy stall.\nHowever, it’s easy to imagine the net impact of all this tightening will eventually hit the\neconomy harder than it has to date. As an example, I saw data suggesting that corporate\ninterest payments as a percent of revenue and household interest payments as a percent\nof disposable personal income have both now only gotten back to 2019 levels. These\nbene�ts from pandemic-era re�nancing and debt repayment won’t last long at current\ninterest rates. If consumers and businesses pull back, they could push the economy into a\n\n\fhard landing.\nSecond, we could experience unexpected turbulence. By nature, we can’t predict most shocks,\nwhen they hit or how hard. The economy is always vulnerable to geopolitical events, a\ncyber shutdown, unanticipated spillovers from troubled sectors or banks pulling back in\nforce. Such shocks could bring in�ation down but at a potentially large cost.\nThird, we could be approaching the wrong airport. The in�ation numbers have come down,\nbut much of the drop has been the partial reversal of pandemic-era goods price increases\nas the economy has normalized. Shelter and services in�ation remain higher than historical\nlevels, presenting a risk that in�ation levels o� at a cruising altitude higher than our 2\npercent target. As I talk to businesses, I still hear too many planning above-normal price\nincreases. After decades without pricing power, businesses, especially those facing margin\npressure, won’t want to back down from raising prices until their customers or competitors\nforce their hands. If that’s the case, I fear more will have to happen on the demand side,\nwhether organically or through Fed action, to convince price-setters that the in�ation era is\nover.\nYou may wonder whether a di�erent destination — say 3 percent in�ation — would be\nacceptable. The answer is no. Credibility is the Fed’s key asset. Changing the target before\nreaching it risks that credibility. You can’t expect people to keep boarding planes if they\ncan’t trust where the planes are going.\nFinally, the landing could be delayed. The U.S. economy continues to defy expectations.\nConsumer spending accounts for over 68 percent of the economy, and it is hard to make a\ncase for a pullback so long as equity values are high and the labor market remains as tight\nas it is. Longer-term rates have dropped recently, which could stimulate demand in\ninterest-sensitive sectors like housing. While you might think this would be a �rst-class\nproblem, strong demand isn’t the solution to above-target in�ation. That’s why the\npotential for additional rate hikes remains on the table.\nSo, a soft landing is increasingly conceivable but in no way inevitable.\nIf we do see the economy weaken, it’s worth remembering that not all slowdowns are\ncreated equal. We’ve been scarred by our memories of the Great Recession and the Volcker\nRecession, but they were particularly long and deep.\nAs the airlines folks might say, this time there’s foam on the runway.\nA slowdown could bring less dislocation in the labor market. Businesses tell me that hiring\nhas become easier, but no one is eager to let go the front-line workers they fought so hard\nto �nd. Latent demand might mean a slowdown would have less of an impact on spending,\nas customers who had to put o� purchases due to price and supply constraints �nally have\nthe opportunity to buy. And a slowdown wouldn’t catch anyone by surprise, as businesses\nhave been planning for a downturn for nearly two years. They slowed hiring, streamlined\ncosts, managed inventory levels, and deferred investment. Banks cut back on marginal\ncredit. If a slowdown does come, the economy should �nd itself less vulnerable.\n\n\fThe FOMC’s December meeting got a lot of attention. We acknowledged the progress on\nin�ation and explicitly rea�rmed our willingness to hike if necessary. We also submitted\nour quarterly forecasts, which showed that FOMC participants expect in�ation to settle\nwithout additional hikes. In that context — in which our forecasts are right and in�ation\ndoes in fact continue to settle — most of us forecasted rate normalization to begin\nsometime this year. But the range of estimates was pretty wide, from no cuts to as many as\nsix.\nI would caution you to focus less on the rate path and more on the �ight path — is in�ation\ncontinuing its descent and is the broader economy continuing to �y smoothly? Conviction\non both questions will determine the pace and timing of any changes in rates.\nTo close, I will note that there’s no autopilot. And the data that come in this year will matter.\nSo, I can’t give more guidance from the �ight deck. Forecasting is di�cult, and conditions\nare ever evolving. As they do, so too will our approach. So, buckle up. That’s the proper\nsafety protocol even if you expect a soft landing.\nThanks, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nBusiness Cycles\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

With the\nexception of interest-sensitive sectors like banking and real estate, the tone has\nshifted decisively away from talking about a recession.\n• You might ask: Why not “declare victory”?

I thought I would speak\nabout the economy and where we may be headed. I caution you these are my thoughts\nalone and not necessarily those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nThe recent data have been remarkable. Twelve-month PCE in�ation is at 2.6 percent. Core\nis down to 2.9 percent. Six-month and even seven-month core in�ation are even lower, just\nbelow our target at 1.9 percent. The 12-month numbers will almost assuredly get even\nbetter over the next �ve months, as we cycle over last year’s in�ationary winter and spring.\nAt the same time, contrary to most forecasts (including mine), the progress on in�ation has\n\n\fcome while the economy has remained healthy. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7\npercent. On Friday, we added another 353,000 jobs. And GDP growth in the last quarter of\n2023 was an impressive 3.3 percent. If you had told me a year ago we would end 2023 with\n2.6 percent in�ation and 3.7 percent unemployment, I would have taken it.\nAs you may know, I don’t like to depend solely on published data. I spend a lot of my time\ntalking to businesses across the Fifth District. And there, too, I’m hearing good news. With\nthe exception of interest-sensitive sectors like banking and real estate, the tone has shifted\ndecisively away from talking about a recession. They may not be hiring as much, but they’re\nnot �ring either. And while price-setters continue to try, they seem more and more\nconvinced that price increases will be smaller, less frequent, and less likely to stick. I take a\nlot of signal from the major consumer products manufacturers. In their most recent\nearnings reports, I was happy to see their realized price increases have �nally moderated,\nfrom double digits a year ago to low single digits today.\nSo now the phrase “soft landing” enters every conversation, suggesting a scenario where\nin�ation returns to our 2 percent target while the economy stays healthy. That could well\nhappen. If so, it would defy almost all predictions of what would happen when the Fed\nraised interest rates so quickly to �ght in�ation. And it would be even more surprising given\nthe challenges we faced last year, from the banking turmoil in the spring to the con�icts in\nUkraine and the Middle East.\nOne can explain why in�ation is settling quickly without much disruption. The extraordinary\nlevels of post-pandemic spending have been normalizing. The painful post-COVID-19 supply\nchain shortages have been largely resolved. The rebound in prime-age labor force\nparticipation and immigration have helped alleviate labor market pressures. And most\nmeasures of in�ation expectations have stayed impressively stable, suggesting that\nbusinesses and consumers have found the Fed and our in�ation target credible. In other\nwords, they likely understood the in�ation surge was temporary, and that with the help of\nFed action, it is now behind us.\nYou might ask: Why not “declare victory” and move rates back quickly to neutral levels? Let’s\nbe clear that nothing would make me happier than a return to the pre-pandemic economy.\nBut there are two reasons for caution.\nFirst, the plane has not landed yet. For the nerds among us, I like the visual of an un�nished\nnegative parabola, with the top being the peak of the pandemic recovery. Annual GDP\ngrowth, which was around 2 percent pre-pandemic, hit 5.8 percent in 2021 and is now\ndown to 2.5 percent in 2023, closing in on its trend growth rate around 2 percent. Threemonth average job growth, which was 214,000 before COVID-19, hit 727,000 in 2021 and is\nnow 289,000, still above the replacement rate of about 100,000. And in�ation, which was\njust under 2 percent before the pandemic, rose to 7.1 percent in June 2022 and is now at\n2.6 percent, on its way back to our 2 percent target. While demand, employment and\nin�ation are all on a good path, there is no certainty where they are headed. A demand\npessimist could point to monetary policy lags, credit tightening, the narrowness of job\n\n\fgains, and the potential for geopolitical shocks and worry about a downturn. An in�ation\npessimist could point to continued strong wage growth and the recent drop in interest\nrates as fueling reacceleration.\nThe Fed is committed to returning in�ation all the way to 2 percent. As I think about that\ncommitment, I can’t help but look to lessons from the past. History tells many stories of\nin�ation head-fakes. For example, at the end of the Volcker era, in�ation seemed to settle\nin mid-1986. The Fed reduced rates. But in�ation then escalated again the following year,\ncausing the Fed to reverse course. I would love to avoid that roller coaster if we can.\nMy second reason for caution is more fundamental. There is an old saying that no one\nreturns from battle unchanged. And, while our wars on COVID-19 and in�ation can’t\ncompare to the horrors of actual war, I’m still wondering how these experiences may have\nchanged our economy. Disruptive events can have lasting consequences; for example, GDP\nnever returned to the pre-crisis trend after the Great Recession.\n\nWhat changes worry me?\nThe labor market certainly has changed. With labor force participation down, employment\nremains more than 4 percent under its pre-COVID-19 trend. My generation, the baby\nboomers, is aging out of the workforce, and its participation has dropped as well. The\nmarket was tight before the pandemic and remains even tighter today. As evidence, wage\ngrowth — as measured by the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker — is still running at 5.0\npercent versus 3.7 percent pre-pandemic. This pressure on wages, and potentially prices, is\nlikely to persist.\nThe housing market has also changed. We lack housing supply — a topic I detailed in a\nspeech late last year. We underconstructed for a generation, and the shortage of skilled\ntrades workers and recent increase in construction costs haven’t helped. We also saw\ndemand increase. With interest rates low and work shifting partly to home, people looked\nfor new places to live. After all, nothing makes you more aware of the �aws of your current\nresidence (or roommate) than spending every waking moment at home. Institutional\ninvestors added to demand, as did second-home purchasers. Housing prices shot up\nacross the board. The market has since cooled somewhat, but with limited supply, prices\nremain high. If housing supply continues to be short, that could mean further pressure on\nprices and rents in coming years.\nAnother change could be deglobalization. COVID-19 laid bare the vulnerabilities associated\nwith globally complex supply chains. Businesses and consumers became painfully aware\nthat a series of unfortunate events — a severe winter storm, a �re at an overseas plant, or\na blocked shipping lane — could snowball into snarled supply chains, goods shortages, and\na spike in costs. We are seeing countries rethink their trading relationships and �rms\nredesigning their supply chains to prioritize resiliency, not just e�ciency. These changes\nwould suggest higher costs and less ability for intermediaries to drive year-over-year\n\n\fe�ciencies. These forces could well put renewed pressure on goods prices.\nLooking forward, I am hopeful but still looking for more conviction that the slowing of\nin�ation is broadening and sustainable. Much of the in�ation drop thus far has come from\nthe partial reversal of pandemic-era goods price increases. Shelter and other services\nin�ation remain higher than historical levels. Now, the Fed is not in the game of picking the\ncorrect makeup of in�ation; our target doesn’t specify how the price of individual items\nshould change, just that the price index overall should increase by 2 percent over time. But\nthe factors I discussed could hinder the continued de�ation in goods and maintain\npressure on shelter and services prices. A recent rebound in consumer sentiment,\ncontinued willingness of consumers to dip into savings, and loosening of �nancial\nconditions could also introduce risk to the in�ation outlook. One could dismiss all these\npressures as exerting only a �eeting impact on in�ation in an otherwise stable\nenvironment, but I fear they could still in�uence expectations, unsettled by the recent\nin�ationary experience. The New York Fed’s in�ation uncertainty measure remains much\nhigher than pre-pandemic levels.\nSo, it’s possible that we will return to the pre-pandemic economy pretty seamlessly. It is\nalso possible that the landing might be somewhat bumpier, with continued in�ation\npressure or demand challenges that we will need to counteract.\nThat’s why I think it is smart for us to take our time. You likely have seen in last week’s\nmeeting that we acknowledged that risks to employment and in�ation are moving into\nbetter balance and stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to cut rates until we\ngain greater con�dence that in�ation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. No one wants\nin�ation to reemerge. And given robust demand and a historically strong labor market, we\nhave time to build that con�dence before we begin the process of toggling rates down.\nThanks.

I thought I would speak\nabout the economy and where it may be headed, and then look forward to your questions\nand input. I caution you these are my thoughts alone and not necessarily those of anyone\nelse on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fContrary to most forecasts, including my own, the economy �nished 2023 strong. Twelvemonth PCE in�ation came down all the way to 2.6 percent. At the same time, despite higher\ninterest rates, global con�icts and banking turmoil, the economy remained healthy, with\nGDP at 3.4 percent and unemployment near historic lows at 3.7 percent. If you had told me\na year or two ago that we would end 2023 with a robust economy and in�ation in the 2s, I\nwould have been pretty happy.\nBut early 2024 data has been a little less encouraging. The �rst two months of PCE in�ation\nhave come in higher, at a 4.3 percent annual rate. And consumer spending, which is nearly\n70 percent of GDP, has come in softer, at 1.3 percent annualized growth over the �rst two\nmonths. There are reasons to underweight some of the recent data, including seasonal\nadjustments and winter weather, but it does raise the question of whether we are seeing a\nreal shift in the economic outlook, or merely a bump along the way.\nWhen trying to interpret uncertain data, I �nd there is one sure�re place to �nd perspective\n— and that’s a Peanuts comic strip. As greeting card buyers know, there really is a Peanuts\nmessage for every occasion. I remember one in which Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus are\nlooking at the clouds — the same clouds — and seeing completely di�erent things. Linus\nsees the pro�le of a painter, a map of a Central American country, and a scene from the\nBible. Charlie Brown sees a “horsie” and a “ducky.”\nThat’s where we are. We are all looking at the same data, but it is easy to come away with\ndi�erent conclusions. So, I thought today I could walk through di�erent ways to look at the\nnumbers, and then give my own perspective. I’ll do my best to channel the sophistication of\nLinus, but you may still see me as Charlie Brown.\nSome of you may be optimists and see the proverbial “soft landing” in the clouds, where\nin�ation returns to our 2 percent target while the economy remains healthy. You might be\nencouraged by the progress seen over the last year. The extraordinary levels of postpandemic spending have been normalizing. The painful post-COVID-19 supply chain\nshortages have been largely resolved. The rebound in prime-age labor force participation\nand recent high levels of immigration have helped alleviate labor market pressures, as have\nproductivity increases perhaps from automation and arti�cial intelligence. Most measures\nof in�ation expectations have stayed impressively stable, suggesting that businesses and\nconsumers have found the Fed’s action and our in�ation target credible. Or you might\nsimply look at the data with a longer lens and gain comfort from 12-month in�ation at 2.5\npercent while three-month job gains remain at a robust 265,000.\nAlternatively, you might see more daunting shapes in the clouds.\nYou might be a demand pessimist. Monetary policy works with a lag, and you might take\nsignal from the recent increase in consumer delinquencies and the challenges in\ncommercial real estate. You might worry about weakness in other interest-sensitive sectors\nas well, like banking, residential real estate, manufacturing and home improvement. You\nmight note that nearly three-quarters of last year’s job gains came from just three sectors\n\n\f— health care and social assistance, leisure and hospitality, and government — and worry\nthat the labor market might be nearing a turning point. Or perhaps the risk of geopolitical\nshocks keeps you up at night.\nAlternatively, you might be an in�ation pessimist. You might point to continued strong\nwage growth in a tight labor market. The Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker is still at 5\npercent, above the February 2020 level of 3.7 percent. You might note consumers’\ncontinued willingness to spend, driven presumably by their healthy personal balance\nsheets: the saving rate is down to 3.6 percent versus 7.7 percent pre-pandemic, and that\nspending is potentially supporting higher prices. Or maybe you notice shifting macro forces,\nwhich arguably have turned in�ationary, from deglobalization, to limited housing supply, to\ndemographics, to energy transition (to the recent weather-driven escalation in cocoa\nprices).\nLastly, you might be a Fed pessimist. You might fear the Fed will keep rates too high for too\nlong or normalize too quickly and allow in�ation to linger. Our job isn’t easy, and history\nteaches that most tightening cycles end poorly, though often heavily in�uenced by an\noutside event like the pandemic or the 1990 Gulf War.\nWhat do I see?\nOn demand, the historic strength of today’s labor market makes a strong case that we are\nnot in a recession today, but I have to believe all this tightening will eventually slow the\neconomy further. After all, corporate interest payments as a percent of corporate revenues\nand personal interest payments as a percent of disposable personal income have only now\n�nally gotten back in the range of 2019 levels, suggesting the full impact of higher rates is\nyet to come.\nIf the economy does cool, it doesn’t need to be as painful as the Great Recession. A\nslowdown this time could bring less dislocation in the labor market. Employers who have\nfought hard to recover from labor shortages tell me they are hesitant to lay people o� and\nrun the risk of being short again. And a slowdown shouldn’t catch businesses by surprise,\nas they’ve been planning for a downturn for two years. They’ve already slowed hiring,\nstreamlined costs, managed inventories, and deferred investment. Banks have cut back on\nmarginal credit. If a slowdown does come, the economy should �nd itself less vulnerable.\nOn in�ation, while I do hear price-setters increasingly convinced that the era of signi�cant\npricing power is behind them, the in�ationary experience of the last two years has surely\ngiven them more courage to use price as a lever. So, I’m still looking for the slowing in\nreported in�ation to sustain and broaden. Before the pandemic, 26 percent of the PCE\nbasket had increases greater than 3 percent year-over-year. Today, that has more than\ndoubled to 54 percent. Much of the in�ation drop thus far has come from the partial\nreversal of pandemic-era price increases on certain goods; in�ation in both shelter and\nservices remains higher than historical levels. Now, the Fed is not in the game of picking the\ncorrect makeup of in�ation. Our target metric is simply the overall price index. But the risk\n\n\fis that as price decreases on goods normalize, continued shelter and services in�ation will\nleave that overall index higher than our target.\nDespite my concerns about demand and in�ation, perhaps it is no surprise that I’m a Fed\noptimist, which is di�erent than believing we are infallible. I am optimistic that keeping\nrates somewhat restrictive can bring in�ation back to our target. While I don’t see the\neconomy overheating, the Fed knows how to respond if it does. And, if the economy slows,\nthe Fed has enough �repower to support it as necessary.\nIn the interim, I think it is smart for the Fed to take our time. At our last meeting, the Fed\nacknowledged that risks to employment and in�ation are moving into better balance and\nstated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to cut rates until we gain greater\ncon�dence that in�ation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent target. No one wants\nin�ation to reemerge. And given a strong labor market, we have time for the clouds to clear\nbefore beginning the process of toggling rates down.\nThanks.

And given a strong labor market, we have time to gain\nthat con�dence.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here today. I thought I would speak\nabout the economy and where it may be headed, and then I look forward to your questions\nand input. I caution you these are my thoughts alone and not necessarily those of anyone\nelse on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nContrary to most forecasts, including my own, the economy �nished 2023 in a good place.\nHeadline in�ation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price\nindex, dropped all the way to 2.6 percent by year-end. For the �nal seven months of the\nyear, annualized core PCE came in just under our 2 percent target. At the same time,\ndespite higher interest rates, global con�icts, and banking turmoil, economic growth was\nhealthy at 3.4 percent, and unemployment remained near historic lows.\nBut early 2024 in�ation data has been disappointing to those who thought that the in�ation\n\n\f�ght was behind us. In the last three months, quarter-over-quarter core PCE in�ation rose\nto 3.7 percent annualized. Headline rose to 3.4 percent. That number, fortunately, is\nnowhere near the 7.1 percent headline in�ation we saw in June 2022 but does remind us\nthat the job is not yet done.\nDemand remains robust. While the headline �rst quarter GDP number came in lower at 1.6\npercent, it was held down by the volatile categories of imports and inventories. Private\ndomestic �nal purchases, a better underlying measure, came in strong, growing at 3.1\npercent. The labor market, too, has remained remarkably resilient. We’ve created 246,000\njobs per month on average in 2024, and the unemployment rate remains low at 3.9\npercent. In fact, unemployment has come in below 4 percent for 27 consecutive months\nnow — the �rst time that has happened since the late ’60s.\nData matter for policy, and with this data whiplash over the last few months, it is natural to\nwonder whether we are experiencing a real shift in the economic outlook, or merely one of\nthe bumps we said we expected along the way. Should we take more signal from the past\nthree months, or the prior seven?\nAs I have traveled my district, I hear lots of views on where we are. I thought I might share\nthe four I hear the most, then o�er my own view. I look forward to your questions at the\nend and hope you’ll o�er your own additions to this list!\nFirst, I still talk to lots of optimists. Encouraged by the progress made over the last year,\nthey expect the economy to stay healthy and in�ation to continue its decline to 2 percent,\neven if slowly. After all, the extraordinary levels of post-pandemic spending have been\nnormalizing. The painful post-COVID-19 supply chain shortages have been largely resolved.\nThe labor market feels far less tight: the rebound in prime-age labor force participation and\nrecent high levels of immigration have helped alleviate labor market pressures, as have\nproductivity increases perhaps arising from automation and arti�cial intelligence. Most\nmeasures of in�ation expectations have stayed impressively stable, suggesting that\nbusinesses and consumers have found the Fed’s actions and our in�ation target credible.\nOptimists point to 12-month core in�ation continuing to decline, down 10 basis points from\nthe beginning of the year to 2.8 percent, and ask, “Why not celebrate declining in�ation and\na healthy economy?”\nNow, of course, not everyone is an optimist. I speak to three types of pessimists: demand\npessimists, in�ation pessimists, and Fed pessimists.\nDespite the strength of today’s economy, demand pessimists believe the real impact of\nmonetary policy and credit tightening is still to come. They worry about the recent\nincreases in consumer delinquencies and the challenges in commercial real estate. They\nsee weakness in other interest-sensitive sectors as well, like banking, residential real estate,\nmanufacturing, and home improvement. They note that nearly three-quarters of last year's\njob gains and over 60 percent of this year’s came from just three sectors — health care and\nsocial assistance, leisure and hospitality, and government — and are concerned that job\n\n\fgrowth may soon begin to fade. And recent events in the Middle East are a reminder not to\nignore the risk of geopolitical shocks.\nIn contrast, in�ation pessimists focus on the strength in the economy, and its potential to\npressure prices. They point to continued strong wage growth in a challenging labor market,\nespecially for skilled trades like construction or nursing. The Atlanta Fed Wage Growth\nTracker is still at 4.7 percent, above the February 2020 level of 3.7 percent. They note\nconsumers’ continued willingness to spend, driven presumably by healthy personal balance\nsheets. The saving rate is down to 3.2 percent versus 7.7 percent pre-pandemic. Many\nmention other forces that have arguably turned in�ationary, from deglobalization to limited\nhousing supply to demographics to energy transition.\nFinally, I also hear from Fed pessimists. They fear the Fed will keep rates too high for too\nlong or normalize too quickly and allow in�ation to linger. Our job isn't easy, and history\nteaches that most tightening cycles end poorly, though often heavily in�uenced by an\noutside event like the pandemic or the 1990 Gulf War.\nWhat do I see?\nOn demand, the historic strength of today’s labor market makes clear we are not in a\nrecession today, but I have to believe all of this tightening will eventually slow the economy\nfurther. With consumers and businesses alike sheltered from higher interest rates thanks\nto pandemic-era debt paydowns and re�nancing, their aggregate interest burden is not yet\nhistorically elevated. To me, that suggests the full impact of higher rates is yet to come.\nIf the economy does cool, it doesn't need to be as painful as the Great Recession. A\nslowdown this time could bring less dislocation in the labor market. Employers who have\nfought hard to recover from labor shortages tell me they are hesitant to lay people o� and\nrun the risk of being short again. And a slowdown shouldn't catch businesses by surprise,\nas they’ve been planning for a downturn for over two years. They've already slowed hiring,\nstreamlined costs, managed inventories, and deferred investment. Banks have cut back on\nmarginal credit. In short, the economy should be less vulnerable.\nOn in�ation, while I do hear price-setters increasingly convinced that the era of signi�cant\npricing power is behind them, the in�ationary experience of the last two years has surely\ngiven them more courage to use price as a lever. Before the pandemic, 26 percent of the\nPCE basket had increases greater than 3 percent year-over-year. Today, that has more than\ndoubled to 58 percent.\nHere's what I’m hearing: For a generation, in the context of low and stable prices, powerful\nretailers, global low-cost supply, and e-commerce-enabled comparison shopping, pricesetters came to believe they had virtually no chance to successfully increase prices. But,\nduring the pandemic’s supply chain cost and availability challenges, price-setters concluded\nthey had no choice but to try to pass on these costs. When they did, they found no\nconsequences. Customers paid. Volumes were hardly impacted.\nNow? While the era of no consequences is over, we certainly aren’t back to the pre-pandemic\n\n\fno chance world. Businesses are still looking to push prices if they can, even if it takes\ngetting creative in segmenting their customer base and product o�erings. Their mentality\nis: There’s no crime in trying — no crime in trying to recover margins, protect margins, or\nenhance margins. And they simply are more con�dent using price as a lever, and I\nanticipate they will only back down when customer elasticity again sends a strong message\nthat price-setters have no chance.\nArguably that signal has registered in goods like apparel and furniture. Most of the in�ation\ndrop thus far has come from the partial reversal of pandemic-era goods price increases,\nbut in�ation in both shelter and services still remains higher than historical levels. Now, the\nFed is not in the game of picking the correct makeup of in�ation. But the risk is that as we\nget less help from the goods sector, continued shelter and services in�ation will leave the\noverall index higher than our target. That’s what we’ve seen so far this year.\nDespite my concerns about demand and in�ation, perhaps it is no surprise that I'm a Fed\noptimist. I am optimistic that today’s restrictive level of rates can take the edge o� demand\nin order to bring in�ation back to our target. While I don't see the economy overheating,\nthe Fed knows how to respond if it does. And if the economy slows more signi�cantly, the\nFed has enough �repower to support it as necessary.\nIn the interim, the recent data whiplash has only con�rmed the value of the Fed being\ndeliberate. The economy is moving toward better balance, but no one wants in�ation to\nreemerge. We have said we want to gain greater con�dence that in�ation is moving\nsustainably toward our 2 percent target. And given a strong labor market, we have time to\ngain that con�dence.\nThanks.

Even in that\ncontext, I don’t think it is controversial to say that the last few years have proven\nparticularly challenging for forecasts.\n• The U.S. economy, particularly its consumer, has been much more resilient to rate\nincreases than most expected. Most anticipated we would be cutting rates by now,\nbut that has not yet been the case.\n• I do believe there are still lags playing out — and that all this tightening will\neventually slow the economy further.\n• I’m open to the idea that r-star has shifted up somewhat. It is too soon to tell, but\nthere’s one way to �nd out: proceed deliberately while keeping a close eye on the\nreal economy. That’s what I am doing.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here today. It has been over two\nyears since central banks around the globe began our e�orts to rein in in�ation. I thought\ntoday I could spend some time looking back at what’s happened in the United States during\nthat period, and then look forward to what might lie ahead. Let me caution that these are\nmy thoughts alone and not necessarily those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nBy the �rst quarter of 2022, the Fed’s preferred in�ation measure — the personal\nconsumption expenditures price index (PCE) — had climbed to 6.6 percent, more than\ntriple our 2 percent in�ation target. Demand was surging, too. Nominal personal\n\n\fconsumption growth was nearly 12 percent in that quarter, over three times the average\ngrowth seen in the prior decade. The Fed needed to take aggressive action, and we did. In\nMarch 2022, we kicked o� our steepest tightening cycle in decades, raising the federal\nfunds rate over 500 basis points in under 18 months. In parallel, we have also reduced our\nbalance sheet by over $1.7 trillion.\nTo most observers, the implications of our aggressive actions were straightforward. High\nrates would bring down in�ation, but with unavoidable side e�ects: a pullback in demand\nand an increase in unemployment. You can see those expectations in the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters from the fourth quarter of 2022. The median respondent\nexpected the economy to slow considerably; GDP growth in 2023 was expected to be 0.7\npercent — well below trend — and unemployment was expected to rise above 4 percent.\nThe median forecasted that in�ation would come down quickly to 2.9 percent by the end of\n2023 and to near target (2.3 percent) by the end of 2024. Based on the November 2022 fed\nfunds futures curve, markets forecasted that rates would peak at 4.89 and be down to 4.11\nby the second quarter of 2024.\nIt’s fair to say most of those expectations have not played out. We didn’t end 2023 with\nsluggish economic growth. Quite the contrary: GDP grew 3.4 percent annualized in the\nfourth quarter of 2023, well above trend. Private domestic �nal purchases suggest this\nyear’s �rst quarter growth has continued to be robust. The unemployment rate remains\nlow at 4 percent. It has now been at or below 4 percent for 30 consecutive months, the\nlongest streak since the ’60s. In�ation came down as expected in 2023 to 2.8 percent by the\nfourth quarter, but surprised high in the �rst quarter of 2024, running at a 3.4 percent\nannualized rate. And, as you well know, the fed funds rate rose to 5.33 percent and, in the\ncontext of stubborn in�ation, has not yet begun to come down.\nSo, let’s talk about what happened. Why were forecasts o�? Well, we should start by\nacknowledging that it is notoriously di�cult to predict where the economy is headed. The\nold joke is that economic forecasting was invented to make weather forecasters look good.\nEven in that context, I don’t think it is controversial to say that the last few years have\nproven particularly challenging. In the aftermath of the pandemic, many of the economy’s\nregularities did not play out as expected.\nI’ll walk through four areas today — economic activity, labor, in�ation and rates — and\ndiscuss what the regularities suggested would occur, what we saw, and the factors that\ncould explain the divergence between the two.\nStarting with economic activity: Soon after the Fed began hiking, recession indicators began\n�ashing. The yield curve inverted in the summer of 2022, a warning sign that has preceded\nthe last eight recessions. It has stayed inverted now for two years. The Conference Board’s\nindex of U.S. leading indicators began to signal recession in 2022 and continued to do so\nuntil this year. But no recession has materialized. Don’t get me wrong: Some sectors, such\nas banking, commercial real estate and housing development will tell you that they\n\n\fcertainly have experienced a recession. But overall, despite higher rates, banking turmoil\nand geopolitical challenges, the U.S. economy has not seen a broader slowdown. Why have\nthese traditional signals missed the mark?\nSome question the signals themselves. Was the yield curve forecasting a slowdown, or was\nit simply forecasting that success over in�ation would allow us to reduce rates? Do the\nleading indicators, �rst identi�ed two generations ago, continue to accurately represent\ntoday’s services-intensive economy?\nOthers look beyond the signals to the unique nature of this consumer-led recovery.\nConsumers make up nearly 70 percent of U.S. GDP and their strength, to put it simply, has\nbeen remarkable. At �rst, the story was the excess savings accumulated early in the\npandemic; consumers spent less during lockdowns and brought in more via federal\nstimulus checks. But even as those funds have been drawn down, consumers have\ncontinued to spend. How can they a�ord to? Asset values are up. The S&P 500 index is up\nnearly 70 percent over the end of 2019. Home values are up nearly 50 percent over the\nsame time period. Real wages have increased, especially for entry-level workers.\nUnemployment is low. In short, feeling wealthier and more stable, consumers seem to be\ncomfortable spending more and saving less. The saving rate is now 3.6 percent, less than\nhalf of what it was pre-pandemic.\nBut it isn’t just consumers. The rise of AI has spurred investment in data centers. Fiscal\nspending, via investments in infrastructure and in our semiconductor industry, is helping\nsustain construction demand. After years of underinvestment in homebuilding following\nthe Great Recession, high post-pandemic housing demand has supported new home\nconstruction, especially as existing housing stock froze due to locked-in low mortgage rates.\nRelatedly, consumers and businesses alike have been sheltered from rising interest rates\nthanks to pandemic-era re�nancing and debt paydowns.\nSo, the U.S. economy, particularly its consumer, has been much more resilient to rate\nincreases than most expected and is likely to stay so as long as valuations remain elevated,\nand unemployment remains low.\nThat brings us to the labor market. The expectation was that workers would pay a price for\nthe Fed’s steep rate path. Yet, here we are, still adding 248,000 jobs per month on average\nthis year. The pessimistic forecasts aligned with what economists call the Beveridge Curve,\na downward sloping curve that depicts the relationship between open positions and the\nunemployment rate. As policy constrained labor demand (and thus caused open positions\nto decline), unemployment was expected to rise.\nYet, two years into our tightening cycle, open positions have dropped signi�cantly for over a\nyear, and unemployment has barely budged. Why might the Beveridge Curve have turned\nvertical? Part of the explanation is what is often called “labor hoarding.” Having just spent\ntwo years desperately trying to �nd and retain workers, �rms have thus far been reluctant\n\n\fto let workers go.\nIn addition, sectors that had lagged behind in the pandemic recovery had a lot of catch-up\nto do. Even as demand faded in some sectors, three sectors — leisure and hospitality,\ngovernment, and health care and social assistance — took up the slack. Nearly threequarters of last year’s job gains and about two-thirds of this year’s have come from just\nthose three sectors.\nNet, the labor market got so far behind during the pandemic, that it has taken a lot of labor\ndemand reduction just to return it to “tight.” Skilled trades like nursing, construction and\nmanufacturing remain in short supply. I recently visited a county in my district that\nsupports over 17,000 workers. About a year ago, one of its largest manufacturers\nannounced a sudden closure, laying o� over 1,000 workers. It seemed like a potential\ncalamity. Yet a year later, the unemployment rate there is stable and low at 3.1 percent.\nThe regional labor market is just that tight.\nIn�ation, of course, has been our intense focus. The expectation — in the context of our\naggressive rate moves, forecasts of slow growth, and the stability of long-term in�ation\nexpectations — was for in�ation to fall relatively quickly back toward our target. In reality, it\nhasn’t been a smooth path down. By the end of 2023, we were well on our way to target. At\nthe beginning of this year, our progress took a step back. And now, in the most recent\nmonths, progress seems to have resumed. Why is in�ation proving so stubborn?\nIf you consider the surprise strength in demand and in the labor market, it is actually quite\nnotable that in�ation has come down as much as it has. We have the supply side to thank.\nSupply chain issues have largely been resolved, enabling a partial reversal of pandemic-era\ngoods price increases. A boost in domestic energy production has helped keep energy costs\nin line. Increases in immigration and a surge in prime-age labor force participation have\nhelped alleviate labor market pressures. And we may well also be seeing a move up in\nproductivity, driven perhaps by automation or even AI.\nBut we still have work to do. Before the pandemic, only 26 percent of the PCE basket had\nannual increases over three percent. In the most recent data, that number has more than\ndoubled, to 58 percent.\nPart of my role as a Federal Reserve Bank president is to talk to businesses in my region to\ngather economic insights. What I hear in those conversations is that the behavior of a\nnumber of price-setters has changed. For a generation, in the context of low and stable\nprices, powerful retailers, global low-cost supply, and e-commerce-enabled comparison\nshopping, many price-setters came to believe they had virtually no chance to successfully\nincrease prices. But, during the pandemic’s supply chain cost and availability challenges,\nmost concluded they had no choice but to try to pass on these costs. When they did, they\nfound no consequences. Customers paid. Volumes were hardly impacted.\nNow? While the era of no consequences is over, we certainly aren’t all the way back to the\n\n\fpre-pandemic no chance world. I talk to many businesses still looking to push prices if they\ncan, even if it takes getting creative in segmenting their customer base and product\no�erings. Their mentality is: There’s no crime in trying — no crime in trying to recover\nmargins, protect margins or enhance margins. And they simply are more con�dent using\nprice as a lever. I anticipate these price-setters will only back down when customer\nelasticity �nally sends a strong message that they once again have no chance.\nOne could argue that message has been sent in most goods sectors, and that’s why\nin�ation for goods has returned to pre-pandemic norms. But services and shelter still have\na way to go.\nI’ll close by discussing rates. Most anticipated we would be cutting rates by now, either\nbecause we returned in�ation to target, or perhaps because the economy took a turn for\nthe worse. Yet, in contrast to the European Central Bank, that has not yet been the case.\nMonetary policy famously works with “long and variable lags.” One possibility is that those\nlags have simply been longer than expected, thanks to many of the factors I discussed\nearlier — labor hoarding, excess savings, delayed exposure to interest rate hikes, newfound\npricing power and the like.\nAnother explanation is that our rate hikes aren’t constraining the economy as much as we\nthink. Some economists point to r-star, the neutral real rate of interest, and wonder\nwhether it hasn’t shifted to a higher level. They might point to the recent apparent pickup in\nproductivity growth, the waning of the Chinese export surplus (and related decline in global\nsavings) or ballooning federal de�cits as reasons behind such a shift. The Lubik-Matthes\nmodel, produced by the Richmond Fed, falls in this camp, and has seen r-star increase from\nclose to zero in the 2010s to a touch above 2 percent now, suggesting a long-run policy rate\nclose to 4 percent. Such a rise in the rate would, of course, mean policy is not as restrictive\nas one might have thought.\nAs for me, I do believe there are still lags playing out — and that all this tightening will\neventually slow the economy further. At the same time, given the remarkable strength we\nare seeing in the economy, I’m open to the idea that r-star has shifted up somewhat. It is\ntoo soon to tell, but there’s one way to �nd out: Proceed deliberately while keeping a close\neye on the real economy. And that’s what I am doing.\nSo, to close, what can we learn from this experience? First, the pandemic was unique.\nLockdowns, extraordinary levels of stimulus, a reopening surge in spending, supply chain\noutages, aggressive monetary policy, and the like all contributed to a novel environment\nthat our economic models weren’t ready to handle. Second, regularities — like the yield and\nBeveridge Curve indicators — can send false signals; they’re not fate written in stone. And\n�nally, agility is key. Forecasts, as we emphasize with each release of the Summary of\nEconomic Projections, are made with the information available in that moment.

I thought today I might talk about how I see the\neconomy and where it may be headed. I’ll then turn it over to you, and I look forward to\nyour questions and comments. I should caution that these are my thoughts alone and not\nnecessarily those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nAs you’ve likely seen, the FOMC cut the fed funds rate 50 basis points at our September\nmeeting. This cut came largely because of the progress we’ve made on in�ation. Twelvemonth headline PCE in�ation is now 2.2 percent, well down from its peak of 7.1 percent in\nJune 2022. Core is at 2.7 percent. Near-term in�ation expectations are back in line with our\n2 percent target. If we look at the most recent data, the in�ation picture is even better:\nThree-month core in�ation is only slightly above target at 2.1 percent. Importantly, the\n\n\fdecline in in�ation appears to be broad-based, not just limited to goods as we had seen\npreviously.\nConsumers are driving this drop. Frustrated by high prices, they have become increasingly\nprice conscious. They’re still spending, but they’re choosing: trading down from beef to\nchicken, from sit-down restaurants to fast casual, from brand names to private label.\nThey’re waiting for promotions: opting for the $5 value meal at McDonald’s or jumping on\ndiscounts at Target. This is how it is supposed to work! The old saying is that the solution to\nhigh prices is high prices. And that’s what we are �nally seeing. Their choices are pressuring\nprice-setters to �nally moderate price increases.\nAt times, in the past, the FOMC has made such a signi�cant rate cut in response to a\ntroubled economy. Happily, that is not the case today. As in�ation has moderated,\neconomic activity has remained robust. GDP came in at 3 percent in the second quarter, a\nmore than healthy growth rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent\nof GDP, has risen at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent in the last two months, supported by\nlow unemployment, higher real wages and high valuations. Thanks in part to this strong\nspending, the U.S. economy has returned to its pre-pandemic GDP trend, a feat that we\nnever achieved after the Great Recession and that most other advanced economies can’t\nclaim.\nThe labor market has remained in good shape as well. We’ve added an average of 116,000\njobs over the last three months. Unemployment has ticked up but remains low at 4.2\npercent, near most estimates of its natural rate. Given how overheated the labor market\nwas just a few years ago, some normalization was to be expected.\nWhy did the FOMC reduce rates so signi�cantly if we are not seeing a troubled economy or\nweak labor market? I see our September decision as a recalibration to a somewhat less\nrestrictive stance. After over a year at a 5.3 percent fed funds rate, headline in�ation had\ncome down closer to target while unemployment was near its natural rate. The number\nthat now seemed out of sync was the fed funds rate, which no longer needed to be as\nrestrictive given the progress that’s been made. Going forward, the median member of the\nFOMC forecasted another 50 basis points in cuts this year, assuming the data come in as\nexpected. This dial back in restraint just takes a little bit of the edge o�.\nI assume many of you were happy to see us start to bring rates down. But please\nremember that our focus has never been on the rates themselves but on in�ation. High\nrates are merely a tool to get in�ation under control, and I’ve been glad to see that we have\ndone so with limited collateral damage to date.\nDoes this cut signal that we are declaring victory? Let me start with some history. “Let’s\ndeclare victory and go home” is a pretty cynical phrase traced back to the 1960s, when Sen.\nGeorge Aiken proposed that the United States should call Vietnam a win and begin to deescalate, regardless of the realities on the ground. As an aside, it’s never good to adopt a\nstrategy from the Vietnam era.\n\n\fSo, I’m not yet con�dent nor cynical enough to declare victory. I’ll walk through three\nreasons:\nFirst, victory means di�erent things to di�erent people. I talk to many people for whom\nvictory would be returning to 2021 interest rates or to pre-pandemic price levels. Both\nwould be challenging absent a signi�cant recession, which I venture to say would not be a\nwin. Some de�ne victory as a stock market that continually moves up, but of course, we\ncan’t and don’t seek to control the stock market. And you may yearn for the stability of the\n2010s, when GDP and employment grew consistently and in�ation barely moved. That\ndecade, however, was unique in recent history. So declaring victory seems bound to\ndisappoint.\nSecond, there is still work to do on in�ation. While down from its high, in�ation remains\nabove our 2 percent target. I don’t expect 12-month core in�ation to drop much further\nuntil 2025, as we are still lapping low in�ation numbers from late last year.\nForecasting in�ation going forward is challenging. On the positive side, we may continue to\nget help from supply-side factors like immigration, increased labor force participation and\nproductivity, as well as from global factors like disin�ation coming from China and\nincreased energy production. Last I saw, per-barrel oil prices were down in the $70s. On the\nother hand, I just got my homeowner’s insurance renewal, and it reminded me that\nin�ationary pressures have not fully disappeared. Recent union actions or a pullback in\nlabor supply could drive higher wages. Health care cost trends could raise premiums\nfurther. Deglobalization could increase import prices. The con�ict in the Middle East could\nworsen.\nI am paying particular attention to the potential impact of our recent rate move on pricing\nfor houses and cars. Buyers will welcome lower rates, but there is a risk that demand is\nstimulated in excess of available supply. Remember, it takes time to get new houses built\nand move cars onto lots. Locked-in homeowners may well start to list their homes as\nmortgage rates drop, but these sellers will also be buyers, increasing demand while they\nare adding to supply.\nSo it remains di�cult to say that the in�ation battle has yet been won.\nA third reason not to declare victory is risk to the labor market. The levels, as I mentioned,\nlook healthy, but the trends bear watching. Job gains are being continually revised down,\nand those sectors (like health care) that have been catching up from pandemic shortages\nare moderating their growth. In fact, the hiring rate has dropped down to 2013 levels. But\nwhile employers aren’t hiring, they also aren’t �ring: The layo� rate is near 25-year lows and\ninitial claims remain muted. Cautious employers are allowing head count to drift\ndownward, but largely through attrition. I hear very few employers planning layo�s (and\nlayo�s do take planning).\nThis low hiring-low �ring environment is unlikely to persist, but again I could make a case\nthat it could evolve in either direction. Of course, a cycle of layo�s could start given pro�t\n\n\fpressures and the excess sta�ng many have chosen to keep after their pandemic-era\nshortages. But demand remains healthy and lower rates could add momentum. Those\nemployers running lean could well �nd themselves short again, particularly if labor force\ngrowth starts to slow. At some point you have to hire to serve your customers.\nYou might notice that I’m wearing a suit, not a “mission accomplished” bomber jacket. It’s\nnot that I’m particularly humble (or formal). I’m just realistic. Victory means di�erent things\nto di�erent people, and — while we have made real progress — there remains signi�cant\nuncertainty on both in�ation and employment. And while we are working hard to deliver\nfor the U.S. economy, we almost certainly won’t get it perfect. Perfection would be a high\nbar when we operate in an environment fraught with uncertainty, under a mandate\nrequiring trade-o�s, with a primary tool — the federal funds rate — that works with long\nand variable lags and without a �nish line. So as we decide how fast to move and how far to\ngo during this rate reduction cycle, we are just going to need to be attentive and learn as\nwe go. I’m hoping to start that process with your questions and comments today.\n\nBusiness Cycles\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

But we hear\ncommunities are struggling to meet that need because they lack housing.\n• The key is more supply. To create that supply, communities need to own the\nproblem, compete for developers, innovate in o�ering a�ordable land and lowering\ncosts and engage with nontraditional partners.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction.\nAt the Richmond Fed, we serve Virginia but also the District of Columbia, Maryland, West\nVirginia and the Carolinas. We are constantly on the ground working to better understand\nthe economy. Just last year we had over 1,700 community engagements. These meetings\ntake us across our district, from Bristol to Alexandria, Winchester to Danville, and Virginia\nBeach to Harrisonburg.\nOver the last few years, talent availability has become critical for economic development.\nBut wherever we go, from the largest cities to the most remote towns, we hear\ncommunities struggling to meet that need because they lack housing. They are short sta�\nin schools, hospitals, child care and local governments. These essential employees all too\noften can’t �nd nearby housing they can a�ord.\nIn my remarks today, I’ll focus on ways communities — like the ones I’ve spent time with\nthis past year — are working to bring housing within reach for workers. These are my\nthoughts alone and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nAnd if you're wondering why the Fed cares about housing, it’s pretty simple. It impacts both\n\n\fsides of our dual mandate — maximum employment, and as has been evident in recent\nyears — in�ation.\n\nLet’s start with homeownership, which is becoming increasingly unattainable for too many\nworkers.\nTake teachers for example. The math all too often just doesn’t work for them. In 2022, the\nmedian middle school teacher made just over $60,000. With that salary today (and without\nbecoming cost-burdened), that teacher can a�ord a $228,000 house with a 20 percent\ndownpayment. But the median price for a new starter home last year was $299,000, and\nthat’s on the o� chance you could even �nd one.\nAnd the math has been getting worse. Average hourly earnings have increased 21 percent\nsince 2019. But one measure of home prices (Case-Shiller) has increased nearly 48\npercent. At the same time, of course, mortgage rates rose from 3.9 to almost 8 percent\ntoday. Why did prices spike so much? Demand and supply.\nDemand was picking up prior to the pandemic but really took o� in the last three years.\nNothing makes you more aware of the �aws of your current residence (or roommate) than\nspending every waking moment at home. So, with interest rates low, people started looking\nfor new places to live, with fewer people per household. Millennials began to settle down.\nInstitutional investors added to demand, as did second-home purchasers.\nBut the buying frenzy ran into constrained supply. Construction costs (including interest\nrates) increased, and the shortage of skilled trades worsened. Timelines got extended as\ngarage doors, counters, appliances and windows became hard to track down. At the same\ntime, fewer existing homes are being listed, as older Americans opt to age in place and\nhomeowners choose not to trade into higher-rate mortgages.\n\nAll this means that it’s now signi�cantly cheaper to rent than to buy. But the math for\nrenting also isn’t great. Supply and demand hit the rental market, too. In 2021, rents spiked\nas national rental vacancy rates dropped to levels not seen in almost 40 years. Our same\nteacher looking for a place to live in 2019 would have faced a median asking rent of $1,643\nper month, already a stretch for their budget. Now, that sum is up 22 percent to $2,011. I\nwill note that we are now seeing some relief in rent growth nationally, as construction has\nbrought more units online.\n\nWe need to make the math work better, both for homeownership and renting. But how?\nWell, subsidizing current prices at a wide scale will only increase demand further,\nworsening the imbalance with supply. Suppressing demand isn’t an attractive option either.\nSo, that leaves us with the need to increase housing supply. Everyone is struggling with this\nissue, but we can learn from each other. For those of you with a competitive spirit, both\n\n\fSouth and North Carolina have issued more permits for private, single-family homes than\nVirginia in each month since 2016. What are we seeing work?\n\nWhile the need for more housing may be obvious to us, it often isn’t to those who don’t\nwant their town to change, or who don’t like the speci�c change being proposed. They\nunderstandably worry about environmental impacts, or infrastructure capacity or school\ncrowding. NIMBYism is real, and failing to secure buy-in from the community adds time,\ncost and uncertainty. How do leaders rally their communities?\nThey articulate the case for housing. The community needs to see housing as integral to\neconomic growth, and regional leaders need to speak with one voice. A good example is\nthe I-68 Regional Alliance, an economic development organization that formed a housing\ncoalition linking rural counties in West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania.\nThey also acknowledge and address legitimate concerns. Cecil County, Maryland, did this by\nmitigating stress about the area losing its rural identity. It created a development plan that\nrestricted growth to a “growth corridor” along the freeway, allowing the rest of the county\nto retain its character.\n\nDevelopers can go wherever they choose. These days, they are scarce, and they are\nrational. Most will go where the upside is highest and the risk is lowest. To get more\nhousing built, jurisdictions need to communicate that they welcome and support\ninvestment. What might that look like?\nUnsurprisingly, �nancial incentives never hurt. In 2022, Wise County implemented a tax\nincentive for renovation, rehabilitation or replacement of residential and commercial\nproperties. In West Virginia, the newly created Build WV program o�ers a tax exemption for\npurchasing construction materials, a 10-year property value tax credit, and the potential for\na business and occupation tax exemption. And I have heard Virginia is exploring a\ndeveloper incentive tied to business recruitment as well. Incentives can be targeted in\norder to attract developers that will build the type of housing the community needs.\nBut it’s not just about money. Developers will go where they can expect cooperation and\ne�cient, predictable timelines. Streamlined permitting helps, as does reducing\nunnecessary regulation. Ensuring su�cient municipal sta�ng can also minimize processing\nand approval timelines. We heard from a group involved in comparable projects on the\nEastern Shore of Maryland and nearby Delaware. The Delaware project progressed much\nfaster. The community did a better job processing permits, and its regulatory standards\nwere clearer. But the most important di�erence was local support. In Maryland,\ndevelopment was slowed by environmental and zoning challenges that delayed the\npermitting process, added cost and increased uncertainty.\n\n\fIn 2022, �nished lot costs made up nearly 20 percent of the average sales price of a new\nsingle-family home, so minimizing these costs can go a long way. In fact, in the few\ncommunities in which housing availability seems less of an issue and the national\nhomebuilders are everywhere — for example, eastern North Carolina — contacts have\npointed to easily available and a�ordable land. What are communities doing to make\na�ordable land more available?\nStart with zoning. Rezoning unlocks underleveraged land for higher density development.\nThat’s what we saw in a Harrisonburg partnership between the local housing authority and\nEquityPlus, LLC. And several jurisdictions, such as Raleigh, North Carolina, are looking to\naccessory dwelling units to expand supply in already built neighborhoods.\nInvest in buildable homesites. States have gotten in the habit of preparing buildable\nindustrial sites to attract businesses. Why not put a similar investment toward buildable\nhomesites available for residential developers? We’ve seen communities, like the City of\nSanford, North Carolina, do this in concert with a particular development partner. Perhaps\nit could be done even earlier in the development cycle.\nLeverage unused land and structures. Many communities are repurposing older structures\nthat are no longer in use to build apartments. Carroll County transformed a historic school\ninto 51 new units. Fayetteville, West Virginia, is retooling an elementary school. In\nCumberland, Maryland, it is an old hospital. Danville is transforming an old textile mill into a\nretail space and 150 apartments. Once you start thinking of the possibilities, it is hard to\nstop, and I know Virginia has e�orts underway to look at all state-owned land that could be\nused for housing.\nPurchase to repurpose. Another way to maximize availability is to prevent older housing\nfrom leaving the market. Some localities are purchasing and converting private dilapidated\nstructures. This process often requires tracking down absentee landlords and clearing up\ntitles. Several towns in West Virginia have used land banks to take ownership of abandoned\nproperties and put them in the hands of developers.\n\nIn 2022, construction costs were three-�fths of the average sales price for a new singlefamily home. These costs are way up and may well stay up. With that reality, can the same\nhousing be built for less? Well, there hasn’t been meaningful productivity growth in the\nconstruction sector in decades. Turning that around would be a good start. Until then, we\nmight ask a di�erent question: whether we need to make “the same homes.”\nCan we make smaller homes? Homes under 1,400 square feet have fallen from 14 percent of\nnew, single-family homes built for sale in 1999 to only 3 percent today. Could that change?\nIt’s worth noting that this is another area where zoning matters. Minimum lot sizes may\ndiscourage smaller builds.\n\n\fCan we make a di�erent type of home? In Hagerstown, Maryland, they are standing up a new\ncommunity of factory-built single-family homes with smaller units starting at $250,000.\nThese homes look like typical single-family homes, but they are built more quickly and\na�ordably. And, importantly, because they are built in a factory, they reduce the need for\nskilled tradespeople on location. While promising, this path has its challenges, such as\nnegative perceptions and zoning limitations.\n\nA number of nontraditional partners are helping improve the math throughout the Fifth\nDistrict.\nFoundations are engaging. In North Carolina, the Golden LEAF Foundation is providing up to\n$6 million to help �nance tax credit projects for federal low-income housing in\ncollaboration with the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency. They are also working with\nthe state disaster recovery agency to fund infrastructure for new housing outside of the\n100-year �oodplain. And they are partnering with Bertie County and the State Employees\nCredit Union Foundation to �nance new housing units exclusively for teachers and state\nemployees.\nEmployers are increasingly investing too. If you think back to the company town era,\nbusinesses used to invest in housing for their employees. Those days may be returning. We\nhear resorts in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and the Northern Neck are building housing for\ntheir employees. In northern Virginia, Amazon is investing to support new housing, too.\nColleges have a lot of potential. Students need housing too, and presumably, new dorms free\nup space for others. In 2022, Southwest Virginia Community College became the �rst in the\nstate to o�er housing, and there is a lot more potential to add housing on community\ncollege campuses if states are willing to clear the barriers to building.\nEven churches are getting into the game. North of Charlotte, Wesley Community\nDevelopment is working with area churches to convert surplus church property into\nhousing. Several local parishes, including Caldwell Presbyterian, have partnered with the\ncity to build a�ordable housing; they have donated land, properties and direct funding.\nTo close, we all know housing availability is limiting communities. The key is more supply.\nTo create that supply, communities need to own the problem, compete for developers,\ninnovate in o�ering a�ordable land and lowering costs and engage with nontraditional\npartners. As I said upfront, this is a math problem — but one where potential solutions are\nbeginning to multiply.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index.\n“The Rent.

In�ation remains too high.\n• There is an unusually wide range of potential paths for the economy going forward\n— from resurgence to soft landing to recession.\n• What path do I see? I do anticipate some sort of a slowdown. I see that slowing as\npart of what it takes to bring in�ation back to target. Price setters need to be\nconvinced.\n• Whether a slowdown that settles in�ation requires more from us remains to be seen.\nWe have time to reconcile competing narratives on demand and to test di�erent\nviews on the trajectory of in�ation.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. I thought I might take 10 minutes to share how I’m\nseeing the economy. Let me caution these are my thoughts alone and not necessarily those\nof anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nAs you well know, the Fed has moved aggressively against in�ation. We have raised rates\n525 basis points in just a year and a half. Hopefully, you agree we needed to take action\nbecause, if there’s one thing we have relearned over the past two years, it is that everyone\nhates in�ation. High in�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it becomes\nunclear when to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It takes\ne�ort to shop around for better prices or to handle complaints from unhappy customers.\nAnd in�ation feels unfair — the wage increase you earned feels arbitrarily taken away at\nthe gas pump.\nWe are making real progress. In September, 12-month headline PCE in�ation was 3.4\n\n\fpercent, down considerably from its peak of 7.1 percent in June 2022. Core was 3.7 percent,\nand in the last three months, core has been 2.5 percent annualized. We aren’t at our 2\npercent target yet, but we’re heading in the right direction.\nAt the same time, the data shows an economy that has remained remarkably healthy.\nDespite fears of a recession, we continue to see strong demand and a resilient labor\nmarket. GDP grew at a remarkable 4.9 percent in the third quarter. Consumer spending\nwas robust, up 4 percent annualized. Unemployment remains low at 3.9 percent. Job\ngrowth has averaged 204,000 over the last three months, roughly double the breakeven\npace.\nIf you had asked me for my forecast a year ago, I would have been pretty happy to be at 3.4\npercent in�ation and 3.9 percent unemployment at this point. We’ve come a long way\nquickly, but the job isn’t done. In�ation remains too high, and the Fed has to walk a �ne\nline. If we undercorrect, high in�ation could return, as happened in the ’70s. If we\novercorrect, we do unnecessary damage to the economy. And even the best policy has the\npotential to be waylaid by external events, as we’ve been reminded with the recent news\nfrom the Middle East.\n\nOur job is complicated by the unusually wide range of potential paths for the economy\ngoing forward — from resurgence to soft landing to recession. Let me talk about each and\nthe implications for policy.\nOne path is reacceleration — demand picks up and, in turn, so does in�ation. The recent data\nlargely tells this story. Third quarter GDP growth de�ed expectations, fueled by consumers\nspending down pandemic-era savings and bene�tting from higher wages and stock prices.\nThe high-end experience economy is a particular hot spot. Despite a slowing in housing\nactivity, home prices have renewed their upward climb — a testament to continued\ndemand amid tight supply. Construction remains strong, supported by infrastructure\nspending and an AI-fueled data center boom. And the job market has been remarkably\nresilient — vacancies have ticked back up, jobless claims have moved down and wage\ngrowth remains elevated. Demand this strong isn’t the �x for in�ation and would likely\nrequire more from us.\nBut I don’t like depending solely on the data, which is published with a lag and revised\nmultiple times. I’ve made it my priority to be on the ground every week in the hopes of\nunderstanding the economy better.\nAnd I’m hearing a di�erent story on the ground. Interest-sensitive sectors, like real estate,\nmanufacturing and deal-making, report they are feeling the impact of higher rates.\nPandemic-era stimulus and excess savings have been largely spent down. Retailers tell me\nlower-income consumers are stretched thin and reprioritizing their spend, and middleincome consumers are trading down, perhaps still buying beef at the grocery store but\nschool notebooks at the dollar store. Banks are feeling margin pressure and have stepped\n\n\fback from riskier sectors, newer customers and less pro�table loans. Another way to look\nat consumer spending is year-over-year where growth numbers look solid but not frothy,\nmaking me think the data may just be showing a catch-up from a weak spring.\nA second potential path is the elusive “softish landing,” in which demand remains solid while\nin�ation comes down to target. Rate increases and tightened credit conditions both work\nwith a lag and may well work to bring in�ation down further in the coming months. Labor\nmarkets seem to be coming into better balance. In�ation expectations remain anchored,\nand the supply side has been working to bring in�ation pressures down: Supply chains\nhave largely been repaired, gas prices have backed o� last year’s highs, productivity has\ngone up, and prime-age labor participation has rebounded. If all these forces continue to\nwork to relieve supply pressure, perhaps in�ation could return to target without more help\nfrom us and without too much damage to demand.\nBut I’m not yet convinced that in�ation is on a smooth glide path down to 2 percent. The\nin�ation numbers have come down, but much of the drop has been the partial reversal of\nCOVID-19-era goods price increases driven by elevated demand and supply shortages.\nShelter and services in�ation remain higher than historical levels. As I talk to businesses, I\nstill hear of too many above-normal cost and price increases. Health care and insurance\ncosts are spiking. Merit pools are down but still above pre-pandemic levels. The recent UAW\nsettlement could spark another round of labor cost pressure. Large consumer goods\ncompanies in sectors like detergents, frozen foods and soft drinks are still raising prices at\nrates much higher than before COVID-19. After decades without pricing power, businesses\naren’t going to back down from raising prices until their customers or competitors force\ntheir hands. Don’t get me wrong — a softish landing would be great. But I fear more will\nhave to happen on the demand side to convince price setters the in�ation era is over.\nA third path is the traumatic recession so many have been forecasting for so long. It could be\ndriven by the Fed’s aggressive rate path, by banks pulling back in force, by geopolitical\nevents, or by some new �nancial crisis stemming from troubled sectors like commercial\nreal estate. Such a downturn usually works to bring in�ation down and turn policy on its\nhead, unless of course it emanates from a supply shock in commodities like oil.\nWe are clearly not in a recession today, based on the strong data I shared. We will be in a\nrecession someday, because no one ever canceled the business cycle. And it’s worth\nremembering that most recent recessions have come from unforeseen events like the\npandemic or 9/11.\nSo, what path do I see? I do anticipate some sort of a slowdown, as I just have to believe the\nnet impact of all this tightening will eventually hit the economy harder than it has. As an\nexample, I saw data suggesting that corporate interest payments as a percent of revenue\nand household interest payments as a percent of disposable personal income have both\nonly gotten back to 2019 levels. These bene�ts from pandemic-era re�nancing and debt\nrepayment won’t last long at current interest rates.\n\n\fI see that slowing as part of what it takes to bring in�ation back to target. As I said, price\nsetters need to be convinced. Whether a slowdown that settles in�ation requires more\nfrom us remains to be seen, which is why I supported our decision to hold rates at our last\nmeeting. With rates restrictive and �nancial conditions tightened, we have time to reconcile\ncompeting narratives on demand and to test di�erent views on the trajectory of in�ation.\nI will say that if we do see the economy weaken, it’s worth remembering that not all\nslowdowns are created equal. We’ve been scarred by our memories of the Great Recession\nand the Volcker Recession, but they were particularly long and deep. As I talk to �rms, I\nhear reasons to believe that any downturn this time might be less severe.\nFirst, it could cause less dislocation in the labor market. When you think of a slowdown, you\nnaturally think of 2008 when manufacturing workers were sidelined across the Rust Belt,\nand those last into the workforce bore a disproportionate burden. But those are the\nworkers I hear are most in demand today, as manufacturing plants, hotels, construction\nsites, and restaurants remain short of workers. Large company layo� announcements this\nyear primarily targeted administrative functions, not front-line workers. These\nprofessionals may have a lower propensity to �le for unemployment, be unemployed for\nshorter periods and often can leverage backup savings to bridge their consumption.\nUnemployment for those with a college degree is just 2.1 percent.\nSecond, a spending slowdown could be mitigated by latent demand. Houses and cars\nbecame expensive and hard to �nd. But should supply open up in a weakening economy, I\nsuspect we would �nd a number of buyers who have deferred purchases over the last few\nyears and are ready to buy.\nAnd, �nally, the prolonged recession preamble could reduce the cost. This has been called\nthe most predicted recession ever. Businesses have been planning for a downturn for 18\nmonths. They have slowed hiring, streamlined costs, managed inventory levels, and\ndeferred investment. Banks have cut back on marginal loans. Many consumers have\ntightened their belts. So, if a recession does come, the economy should �nd itself less\nvulnerable. And if it doesn’t come, today’s conservatism can fuel tomorrow’s revival. You\nmight even argue that the recent strength in the economy is being supported in part by\nbusinesses, consumers and governments that have outperformed their recessionary\nforecasts.\nSo, that's how I'm seeing the economy today.

That’s why I’ve made it my priority to be on the\nground every week in the hopes of understanding the economy better.\n• There is somewhat of a disconnect between the data and what I hear on the ground.\nI see an economy that is much further along the path to demand normalization than\nmuch of the data would tell you.\n• But the question is how much of this softening is feeding through to in�ation. The\npath for in�ation isn’t yet clear.\n• That’s why I supported our decision at our last meeting to keep rates steady and wait\nfor more information. We have time to see if we have done enough, or whether\nthere’s more work to do.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me with you. You may know that the\nlast time the Fed tackled high in�ation, in the ’80s, homebuilders sent Paul Volcker two-byfours inscribed with the message: Lower interest rates. I look forward to hearing from you\ntoday but am hoping you checked your lumber at the door.\nTo set up our discussion, I thought I might share how I am seeing the economy. Let me\ncaution these are my thoughts alone and not necessarily those of anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nAs you well know, the Fed has moved aggressively against in�ation that was way too high.\n\n\fWe have raised rates 525 basis points in just a year and a half. Hopefully you agree we\nneeded to take action because, if there is one thing we have relearned over the past two\nyears, it is that everyone hates in�ation. High in�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise\nunevenly, it becomes unclear when to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is\nexhausting. It takes e�ort to shop around for better prices or to handle complaints from\nunhappy customers. And in�ation feels unfair — the wage increase you earned feels\narbitrarily taken away at the gas pump.\nWe are the folks mandated to tackle in�ation, but we only have one primary tool: raising\ninterest rates. It’s a powerful tool, as you know, but a blunt one. As we raise rates,\nborrowing becomes more costly, banks pull back, capital investment slows and consumer\nspending weakens, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors like real estate, autos,\nmanufacturing and deal-making. Reduced demand lessens the rate of in�ation in time.\nBut this tool doesn’t hit all sectors evenly. And, of course, I recognize our rate hikes hit your\nindustry early and disproportionately.\nI hope you agree we are making progress on in�ation. Our in�ation target is 2 percent. In\nSeptember, 12-month headline CPI in�ation was 3.7 percent, down considerably from its\npeak of 9.1 percent in June 2022. Core was 4.1 percent, and in the last three months has\nbeen 3.1 percent annualized. We aren’t there yet, but we’re headed in the right direction.\nWe’ve had some help. Supply chains have largely opened up. Labor force participation has\nrebounded. And gas prices have fallen from last year’s highs.\nNow there’s a story — a plausible story — that weakening demand is already working to\nbring in�ation down to 2 percent. Demand is weakening because rate increases work with a\nlag, and many models estimate their impact really starts to hit around now. Demand is\nweakening as long-term rates rise. Demand is weakening because credit conditions\ntightened following the bank turmoil earlier this year. And demand is weakening because\nthe pandemic economy continues to fade. Savings are being spent down. Fiscal stimulus\nhas waned. As demand settles, that reduces its imbalance with supply and brings in�ation\nback to target.\nIt's a plausible story but — if I can borrow from my time as a Boy Scout — this isn’t our �rst\ncamp�re. We have all told ourselves a number of stories about in�ation over the last two\nyears. They each seemed compelling at the time, but none have yet seen a happy ending.\nAt �rst, in�ation seemed transitory, as �scal stimulus faded and the economy fully\nreopened. Then supply chain remediation and lower commodity prices looked likely to feed\nthrough to prices. Then, when we raised rates and shrunk our balance sheet so\naggressively last year, you might have thought in�ation would have come back in line\nquickly. But in�ation remained elevated.\nSo, I am still looking to be convinced, both that demand is settling and that any weakness is\nfeeding through to in�ation. These are particularly hard questions to answer today because\nthere is somewhat of a disconnect between the data and what I hear on the ground.\n\n\fThe data will tell you that demand is not weak. GDP remains solid, growing 2.1 percent in\nthe second quarter. S&P Global forecasts a remarkable 5.2 percent in the third quarter.\nThat growth has been in no small part due to the consumer who has continued to spend\ndown pandemic-era savings and bene�t from higher wages and rising stock prices. Despite\na slowdown in housing activity, home prices have renewed their upward climb this year — a\ntestament to continued demand amid tight supply. And after slowing last year, business\ninvestment has rebounded, reaching 7.4 percent annualized growth in the second quarter.\nThe data will also tell you that the labor market is not weak. Unemployment remains low at\n3.8 percent. Job growth came in at 336,000 in September, triple the breakeven pace. It has\naveraged 266,000 over the last three months. Vacancies remain higher than pre-pandemic\nlevels. Wage growth is still elevated. Initial jobless claims in the last four weeks were below\n2019 levels.\nSo, if you believe the data, something’s got to give. Demand that strong isn’t the �x for\nin�ation.\nBut I don’t like depending solely on data. It comes in a month late. Then it is revised\nmultiple times. And it is adjusted by seasonal factors distorted by the pandemic. That’s why\nI’ve made it my priority to be on the ground every week talking to groups like this in the\nhopes of understanding the economy better. I’m hearing a di�erent message on the\nground.\nI’m hearing demand is softening. Interest-sensitive sectors like yours are of course feeling\nthe impact of higher rates. Businesses that sell to lower-income consumers tell me those\nconsumers are stretched thin and reprioritizing their spend. Middle-income consumers are\ntrading down. Banks are feeling margin pressure and have stepped back from riskier\nsectors, newer customers and less pro�table loans. Construction backlogs are being\nworked down.\nI’m also hearing that parts of the labor market are coming into better balance. It’s easier to\n�nd workers, especially professionals. Turnover is down. Wage pressure still exists but has\nmoderated from last year’s extreme levels. An exception, to be sure, is skilled trades, which\nremain quite tight.\nThe question is how much of this softening is feeding through to in�ation. Goods de�ation\nis back, as inventories and demand come into better balance. Rental vacancies are\nincreasing, which should mitigate in�ation in that key sector. But while most businesses\nacknowledge that the period of major pricing power is behind them, I’m still talking to a\nnumber that want and feel they need to push price where they can.\nSo, I see an economy that is much further along the path to demand normalization than\nmuch of the data would tell you. But the path for in�ation isn’t yet clear. That’s why I\nsupported our decision at our last meeting to keep rates steady and wait for more\ninformation, both from data and conversations on the ground. We have time to see if we\nhave done enough, or whether there’s more work to do.\n\n\fBut I recognize there are a wide range of potential paths going forward — from resurgence\nto recession to return to the pre-COVID-19 normal. And we are walking a �ne line. If we\nundercorrect, in�ation re-emerges. If we overcorrect, we do unnecessary damage to the\neconomy. And even the best policy has the potential to be waylaid by external events, as\nwe’ve been reminded with the recent news from the Middle East.\nI will say that if we do see the economy weaken, it’s worth remembering that not all\nrecessions are created equally. We’ve been scarred by our memories of the Great\nRecession and the Volcker Recession, but they were particularly long and deep. As I talk to\n�rms, I hear reasons to believe that any downturn this time might be less severe.\nFirst, it could cause less dislocation in the labor market. When you think of a slowdown, you\nnaturally think of 2008 when manufacturing workers were sidelined across the Rust Belt\nand those last into the workforce bore a disproportionate burden. But those are the\nworkers I hear are most in demand today, as manufacturing plants, hotels, construction\nsites and restaurants remain short of workers. Large company layo� announcements this\nyear have primarily targeted administrative functions, not front-line workers. These\nprofessionals may have a lower propensity to �le for unemployment, be unemployed for\nshorter periods and often can leverage backup savings to bridge their consumption.\nUnemployment for those with a college degree is just 2.1 percent.\nSecond, a spending slowdown could be mitigated by latent demand. Houses and cars became\nexpensive and hard to �nd. But should supply open up in a weakening economy, I suspect\nwe would �nd a number of buyers who have deferred purchases over the last few years\nand are ready to buy.\nAnd, �nally, the prolonged recession preamble could reduce the cost. This has been called the\nmost predicted recession ever. Businesses have been planning for a downturn for 18\nmonths. They have slowed hiring, streamlined costs, managed inventory levels and\ndeferred investment. Banks have cut back on marginal loans. Many consumers have\ntightened their belts. So, if a recession does come, the economy should �nd itself less\nvulnerable. And if it doesn’t come, today’s conservatism can fuel tomorrow’s revival. You\nmight even argue that the recent strength in the economy is being supported in part by\nbusinesses, consumers and governments that have outperformed their recessionary\nforecasts.\nSo, that’s how I’m seeing the economy. I’m interested in your insights.

The pandemic era\nseems to have made the jobs market less predictable and left a number of\nemployers scrambling for workers.\n• Employers caught short aren’t standing still.

That’s why I supported our\ndecision to hold rates steady at the last meeting. We have time to see if we’ve done\nenough, or whether there’s more work to be done.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here. I want to spend some time\ntoday talking about the economy and particularly the labor market. And then I look forward\nto your questions. Before I jump in, let me note these are my thoughts alone and not\nnecessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe U.S. economy has proven remarkably resilient. The Fed has raised rates 525 basis\npoints in the last year-and-a-half to �ght in�ation and, yet, GDP remains solid, growing 2.1\npercent in the second quarter. S&P Global forecasts 3.6 percent growth in the third\nquarter. That growth has been in part due to the consumer, who has continued to spend\ndown pandemic-era savings and bene�t from higher wages and rising equity valuations.\nUnemployment is low at 3.8 percent.\n\n\fAt the same time, in�ation has started to settle. In August, 12-month headline CPI was 3.7\npercent, down from its peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022. Core was at 4.3 percent. Gas prices\nhave fallen from last year’s highs, supply chains have largely opened up, and the Fed’s\nmonetary policy moves have begun to have their e�ect, particularly on interest-sensitive\nsectors like housing, commercial real estate and deal-making.\nWhere will demand and in�ation go from here? It’s hard to know. There are those who\nbelieve in�ation will settle further without much additional erosion of demand; there are\nthose who believe the �ght against in�ation will require a more signi�cant slowdown. I\nbelieve the labor market will be key to answering this question.\nEverywhere I go, from farms to factories to ballparks, I still hear that labor is short. Yes,\nhiring has become easier than in early 2022. Yes, the Great Resignation has largely passed,\nparticularly for professionals. And, yes, people are slowly coming back to the o�ce. But\neasier isn’t the same as “back to normal.” Demand is still healthy, and, for many employers,\nthe labor market still feels out of balance. If good workers remain hard to �nd, wages could\nrise further, pressuring margins and prices in turn. So, I want to spend my time today\ndigging into what’s happening in the labor market, and where it may go from here.\n\nLet me start with some math. In February 2020, 61.1 percent of the population was\nemployed. Today, that number is down 0.7 percentage points (equivalent to nearly 1.8\nmillion workers) at a time when real GDP has expanded over 6 percent since before the\npandemic. That gap helps explain why labor feels so short. It is. Demographics play a role.\nSome was predictable due to natural aging of the baby-boom generation. But the rest of\nthe gap is almost entirely attributable to lower participation rates for those at or near\nretirement age, perhaps supported by stronger 401(k) plans or the desire to help with child\ncare for grandkids.\nDemographers have forecast this reduction in the workforce for a while. For decades, our\neconomy operated with a growing labor force. We bene�tted from the baby boom, women\nmore fully entering the workforce, increased educational attainment better preparing\nworkers, improved health leading to longer careers and historically high levels of\nimmigration. All of that was supplemented by access to ever-growing pools of o�shore,\nlow-cost labor.\nThese tailwinds look like they are becoming headwinds. The growth of the working-age\npopulation is relatively straightforward to forecast, and predictions aren’t good. Fertility\nrates are down. K-12 school enrollment is projected to decline by nearly 8 percent between\n2019 and 2031. My generation is aging out of the workforce. Immigration policy looks\nunlikely to materially change soon. O�shoring has been complicated by increased\nawareness of the risk associated with dependence on foreign labor sources.\n\nBut it’s more than the overall numbers that are discombobulating employers. It’s not just\n\n\fthe level of supply but its distribution.\nOver time, employers had become comfortable with where their jobs rated versus those\no�ered by others. Think of it as a job hierarchy. They knew the level of investment in wages,\nbene�ts and working conditions they needed to make to hire and retain workers in what\nwas a relatively stable marketplace.\nBut the pandemic era seems to have reshu�ed that hierarchy considerably, making the\njobs market less predictable and leaving a number of employers scrambling. Three things\nhappened during COVID-19.\nThe �rst was a shift in relative compensation. Firms didn’t sit idly by as the pandemic created\nlabor shortages. Growth sectors, like warehousing, �lled their needs by o�ering high entry\nwages. Employers that found themselves short o�ered new perks or higher wages to\nconvince workers to come. In leisure and hospitality, for example, wages have increased 26\npercent since the start of the pandemic, compared to an 18 percent increase in the private\nsector overall. Segments that struggled to �nd the money to raise wages, such as state and\nlocal government, fell behind.\nThe second shift was that the COVID-19 experience made a number of jobs objectively less\nattractive. Whole sectors, like restaurants and theme parks, shut down, sending a message\nthat those sectors weren’t as secure as they had seemed. Supply chain challenges\nincreased stress on those in manufacturing. And for some jobs, like teachers, nurses and\nchild care providers which had historically earned points for the revered roles they hold in\nour society, the pandemic also crystallized that they face higher health risks, at least during\na crisis.\nThird, there was a shift in employee attitudes. The most obvious place is in preference for\nremote work. Jobs that can provide days at home have rocketed up the hierarchy. But there\nseems to be an even broader change in employee willingness to trade o� work and home.\nMy travels in the Fifth District drive this home. I talked to a coal company that in part can’t\nhire miners at high pay because cell phones don’t work in the mine shaft. And I heard from\na manufacturer in South Carolina that was losing workers to the Bojangles down the street.\nThe pay gap between the two companies may have shrunk, yes. But the attrition seemed\nmore linked to the ability to control work schedules and work in an indoor environment.\nConditions taken in stride prior to the pandemic, such as last-minute overtime shifts or\ngrueling physical labor, seem to require more of a premium now.\n\nThose employers caught short aren’t standing still.\nMany are investing to increase the supply of labor. This is good for workers, good for growth\nand reduces in�ationary pressure. I hear of a number of e�orts to bring in new workers o�\nthe sidelines, through training partnerships with community colleges, apprenticeships and\ninternships, and investments to reduce barriers to work like transportation, child care and\naccess to housing. This investment in talent could be particularly important given the\n\n\fimpact of the pandemic on the social and educational preparedness of those entering the\nworkforce.\nOthers are investing to reduce demand for labor. You can see that clearly in hotels, where\nhousekeeping is no longer always automatic every day, and many lounges are still closed.\nMore fundamentally, wage and sta�ng pressure has made automation more economically\ncompelling. McKinsey estimates that automation, including AI, could replace tasks that\naccount for about 30 percent of the hours worked in the United States by 2030. All else\nequal, these investments are also likely disin�ationary and increase capacity for growth.\nBut, while the buzz around automation and AI is inescapable, most jobs won’t change\novernight.\nAnd, of course, we are seeing employers �ght their way up the job hierarchy by adjusting wages,\nbene�ts and the work environment. Some are doing so by improving working conditions,\nlimiting overtime or last-minute scheduling, o�ering more �exible work arrangements or\ninstalling air conditioning. But those who can a�ord to reprice are doing so, raising wages\nto remain competitive. After all, workers expect more now. The New York Fed’s Survey of\nConsumer Expectations suggests that the average reservation wage — the lowest wage\nsomeone would accept for a new job — has increased over 20 percent from its prepandemic level. This has been quite visible in the recent negotiations in parcel companies,\nairlines and now autos, but is true in nonunion environments too. It's worth noting that\nwages generally only move in one direction. Those who are ahead of the curve won’t cut\nthem. Those who are losing out on workers eventually will raise them. We can expect that\nnet impact to be in�ationary, barring any adjustments to monetary policy.\n\nIt is hard to know how this will balance out. Will labor supply come back even further as\nemployers invest in training and retirees �nd themselves bored or squeezed? Will labor\ndemand settle as automation rolls out or the economy weakens? Will employees return to\ntheir pre-COVID-19 preferences? Or will employers bite the bullet and increase wages and\nthen prices even further?\nThe range of potential outcomes, to me, is still pretty broad. That’s why I supported our\ndecision to hold rates steady at the last meeting. We have time to see if we’ve done enough,\nor whether there’s more work to be done. The path forward to me depends on whether we\ncan convince ourselves in�ationary pressures are behind us, or whether we see them\npersisting. I will be watching the labor market closely for those signals.\nWith that, let me open to questions or comments.\nThis �gure was updated in order to represent the forecast available at the time of\npublication.\n“Generative AI and the future of work in America.” McKinsey Global Institute, July 26, 2023.\n\n\fIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBusiness Cycles\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

Forecasts keep getting\npushed out. No one banished the business cycle, so those who keep predicting a\nrecession will eventually be right. But most recessions come suddenly.\n• Some fear that the Fed’s commitment to reining in in�ation will be that shock to the\neconomy. To be sure, the Fed’s objective is not to cause a recession; it’s to reduce\nin�ation, in line with our mandate.\n• There is still a plausible story that in�ation normalizes in short order and the\neconomy dodges additional trauma. Certainly, last month’s in�ation read was a good\none and I hope it is a sign.\n• As I talk to �rms, I hear reasons to believe that — if a recession were to occur this\ntime — it might be less severe.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here. Today, I want to speak about\nthe economy and where we may be headed. I caution you these are my thoughts alone and\nnot necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI look forward to your questions at the end, but I will start with the number one question\nI’ve been hearing, which is:\n“‘Are we headed into a recession?’ I would caution you that no one canceled the business cycle,\nso one can never fully rule out a recession — it’s just a question of timing. But I get why the\nconcern might be elevated today. Fiscal support from the pandemic is waning and … in�ation is\n\n\fmoving the Fed to increase rates. … Those who look more closely for signals may be pointing to\n… the yield curve, a closely watched recession predictor that has predicted eight of the last seven\nrecessions …”\nNow, what makes forecasting a recession so hard is that the question never seems to go\naway. In fact, the response I just gave comes word for word from a speech I gave last\nsummer. I know it’s a bit self-referential to quote yourself, but it’s telling that we are having\nthe same conversation over and over again.\nThis has been called the most predicted recession in memory. Forecasts keep getting\npushed out. For example, in a November 2022 Bloomberg economist survey, the median\nrespondent expected a recession in the �rst quarter of this year. In January, that got\npushed to the second quarter. In May, it was the third quarter. The Conference Board’s\nLeading Economic Index, historically a credible indicator, has been deteriorating and\ntherefore predicting a recession, over each of the last 15 months.\n\nBut a recession hasn’t happened, even though the Fed has raised rates 525 basis points\nover the last 17 months in an e�ort to �ght in�ation, which is now in the 4 percent range.\nGDP remains solid, growing 2.4 percent in the second quarter, in no small part thanks to\nthe consumer. Higher-income consumers are still spending, and higher wages are\nsupporting consumption, too. The labor market has also remained remarkably resilient,\nwith the unemployment rate at a historically low 3.6 percent. We have added nearly 1.7\nmillion jobs and 2 million people to the labor force thus far this year.\nSo, why haven’t we seen a recession? I think it’s because the pandemic is still with us — not\nthe public health crisis, thankfully, but the economic dislocation it unleashed.\nBusinesses experienced severe shortages over the last few years. So, they tell me they are\nholding on to workers and investing in safety stock. More fundamentally, they are still\nseeing healthy demand from their customers, and working through order backlogs. And\nmanufacturing and construction are seeing a boost from coming government investments\nin infrastructure and the like. If your business is healthy, why cut back?\nAt the same time, consumers continue to spend, funded by excess savings accrued during\nthe pandemic, elevated equity and housing wealth, and a robust jobs market. This year, the\ndrop in gasoline prices has freed up additional spending capacity. In June, the\nTransportation Security Administration hit a new daily record for number of passengers\nscreened. Barbie grossed $162 million in its �rst weekend. Taylor Swift is on a billion-dollar\ntour. Consumer spending is 68 percent of the economy and, while weaker, is still far from\nweak, as was shown in the most recent strong retail sales report.\nYou might still ask: Well, how about now? Are we �nally going to experience the recession\neveryone has been predicting? Well, we will someday. As I said up front, no one banished\nthe business cycle, so those who keep predicting a recession will eventually be right.\n\n\fBut most recessions come suddenly. Remember the pandemic or the global �nancial crisis.\nUnexpected shocks cause consumers and businesses to pull back in unison. For sure that\ncould happen here; imagine, for example, a cyber shutdown. I’m not going to try to make a\nprediction on the unexpected.\n\nBut I usually get the recession question these days due to a fear that the Fed’s commitment\nto reining in in�ation will be that shock to the economy. In�ation remains too high. And if\nthere is one thing we have relearned over the past two years, it is that in�ation is painful,\nand everyone hates it. They hate the uncertainty. They hate that it feels unfair. And frankly\nthey �nd it exhausting.\nOur e�orts to address in�ation arguably have pushed several industries into minirecessions already. Interest-sensitive sectors like housing and manufacturing have slowed.\nCommercial real estate (particularly o�ce) is challenged. Banks have experienced turmoil.\nAnd those with lower incomes are trading down and slowing spending as their savings are\ndrawn down.\nFurther slowing is almost surely on the horizon. A number of pandemic-era �scal support\nprograms are ending. Rate increases work with a lag; many models estimate their impact\nshould start to really hit around now. In addition, as banks preserve liquidity and protect\nearnings by stepping back from marginal lending, credit conditions have tightened,\nreducing consumer and business spending capacity.\n\nNo one wants a recession, but it’s worth remembering that not all recessions are created\nequally. We’ve been scarred by our memories of the Great Recession and the Volcker\nRecession, but they were particularly long and deep.\nAs I talk to �rms, I hear reasons to believe that — if a recession were to occur this time — it\nmight be less severe.\nIt could cause less dislocation in the labor market. When you think of a slowdown, you\nnaturally think of 2008 when manufacturing workers were sidelined across the Rust Belt\nand those last into the workforce bore a disproportionate burden. But those are the\nworkers I hear are most in demand today, as manufacturing plants, hotels, construction\nsites and restaurants remain short of workers. Recent large company layo�\nannouncements have targeted administrative functions, not front-line workers. These\nprofessionals may have a lower propensity to �le for unemployment, be unemployed for\nshorter periods and often can leverage backup savings to bridge their consumption.\nUnemployment for those with a college degree runs at 2 percent.\nA spending slowdown could be mitigated by latent demand. Houses and cars became\nexpensive and hard to �nd. But should supply open up in a weakening economy, I suspect\nwe would �nd a number of buyers who have deferred purchases over the last few years\n\n\fand are ready to spend.\nAnd the prolonged recession preamble we’ve seen could reduce the cost. Businesses planned\nlast year and are planning this year for a recession. They have slowed hiring, streamlined\ncosts, managed inventory levels and deferred investment. Banks have cut back on marginal\nloans. Many consumers have tightened their belts. So, if a recession does come, the\neconomy should �nd itself less vulnerable. And if it doesn’t come, today’s conservatism can\nfuel tomorrow’s revival. You might even argue that the recent strength in the economy is\nbeing supported in part by businesses, consumers and governments that have\noutperformed their recessionary forecasts. These windfalls may be lifting consumer\nsentiment too.\nFinally, of course, there is still a plausible story that in�ation normalizes in short order and\nthe economy dodges additional trauma. There has been a lot of talk over the last few weeks\nabout the potential for what is often called a “soft landing.” Certainly, last month’s in�ation\nread was a good one and I hope it is a sign. To be sure, the Fed’s objective is not to cause a\nrecession; it’s to reduce in�ation, in line with our mandate. We learned in the ’70s that if\nyou don’t get in�ation under control, it comes back even stronger.\nWith that, let me say I certainly hope I will be back with you next year and that the economy\nwill be resilient enough that I will have the opportunity to quote myself yet again!\nAnd now let me open it up for your questions and input.\nCurran, Enda, and Reade Pickert. “Recession Calls Keep Getting Pushed Back, Giving Soft\nLanding Believers Hope.” Bloomberg, May 17, 2023.\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBusiness Cycles\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\n\fEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

Think of it as slowing your boat as you approach the dock.\n• If coming data doesn’t support the plausible story, I’m comfortable doing more. The\nexperience of the ‘70s provides a clear lesson: If you back o� in�ation too soon,\nin�ation comes back stronger, requiring the Fed to do even more, with even more\ndamage.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here. I will talk a bit about the state\nof the economy and then look forward to your questions. These are my thoughts alone and\nnot necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI want to start with in�ation. While down from its peak, in�ation remains too high. Our\ntarget is 2 percent, and that has served us well for a generation. But in April, 12-month\nheadline PCE was 4.4 percent. Core was at 4.7 percent. We got the May CPI on Tuesday, and\nit showed 12-month headline at 4.0 percent and core at 5.3 percent.\n\n\fIf there is one thing we have relearned over the past two years, it is that everyone hates\nin�ation. High in�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it becomes unclear\nwhen to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It takes e�ort to\nshop around for better prices or to handle complaints from unhappy customers. And\nin�ation feels unfair — the wage increase you earned feels arbitrarily taken away at the gas\npump.\nThe Fed has moved aggressively against in�ation, hiking rates 5 percentage points in the\nlast 15 months. But in�ation has proven stubbornly persistent. That’s true even if you\nexclude shelter in�ation, whereby some accounts the data is lagging. I like to monitor\nmonthly median PCE to look at the breadth of in�ation. But it hasn’t come in at levels\nconsistent with our 2 percent target in any month since spring of 2021. It’s hard to say we’re\napproaching our target when we haven’t yet hit it even for one month.\nIn part, I think in�ation has persisted because the pandemic has remained with us — not\nthe public health crisis, thankfully, but the economic dislocation it caused. Demand remains\nelevated, supported by ongoing �scal outlays, nearly a trillion dollars in excess savings and\ntens of trillions more in added equity and housing wealth. At the same time, supply is still\nconstrained by pandemic-era retirements and residual supply chain challenges in areas like\nautos, switchgears and machinery. The process of getting supply and demand back in\nbalance has been slow.\nIt’s also clear that the in�ation experience of the last few years has left its mark. Businesses\nhave rediscovered the pricing lever. If they can raise prices and not lose much volume, they\nhave an e�cient path to increased earnings. They won’t throw that option away until\ncompetitors and customers force their hand.\nSo, the Fed is still working to bring in�ation back to target.\n\nNow I do see a story — a plausible story — for how in�ation comes down. That story relies\non weakening demand to control in�ation.\nDemand weakens because rate increases work with a lag. We started increasing rates 15\nmonths ago, and many models estimate their impact starts to really hit around now.\nDemand weakens because credit conditions tighten. Following the bank turmoil earlier this\nyear, banks preserve liquidity and protect earnings by stepping back from marginal\nlending. And demand weakens because the pandemic economy continues to fade. Savings\nare spent down. Fiscal stimulus wanes. Consumption normalizes. As demand settles, that\nreduces its imbalance with supply and brings in�ation back to target.\nIt’s a plausible story. But this isn’t our �rst camp�re. We have all told ourselves a number of\nstories over the last two years. They each seemed compelling at the time, but in�ation\nhasn’t yet seen a happy ending. At �rst, in�ation seemed transitory, as �scal stimulus faded\nand the economy fully reopened. Then supply chain remediation and lower commodity\nprices looked likely to feed through to prices. Then, when we raised rates and shrunk our\n\n\fbalance sheet so aggressively last year, you might have thought in�ation would have\nquickly come back in line. But in�ation, while down, is still elevated.\nSo, I am still looking to be convinced, both that demand is settling and that any weakness is\nfeeding through to in�ation. That is particularly challenging because the data has been\njumping around.\nLet me take you through how I’m seeing that story develop.\nI do believe demand is softening. You can see the impact of rate hikes in more interestsensitive sectors like housing, manufacturing and business investment. Banks are feeling\nmargin pressure and tell me they are absolutely stepping back from riskier sectors, newer\ncustomers and less pro�table loans. That seems to have particularly hit small businesses\nand commercial real estate. And those who sell to lower-income segments tell me these\nconsumers are cutting back and trading down, as pandemic era supports expire.\nBut consumer spending remains resilient. Think of it as weaker but not yet weak. Higherincome consumers are still spending, and higher wages are supporting consumption too.\nOver the last six months, the o�cial data has bounced around, with two strong months and\nfour weak ones. I take a lot of signal from credit and debit card data which shows yearover-year spending �attish since February.\nThat brings us to the labor market. Here, while secondary indicators like job openings and\nquit rates seem to be normalizing, we keep adding jobs month after month after month.\n339,000 jobs were created in May — over three times the breakeven rate. Supply is getting\na boost from increased prime-age participation and a bounce back in immigration. My\ncorner sports bar has now reopened on Sundays and Mondays. Unemployment remains at\na historically low 3.7 percent, and wage growth is still above pre-pandemic levels.\nI’m increasingly wondering whether the pandemic era hasn’t made the labor market\nsomewhat more resilient. When you think of a slowdown, you naturally think of 2008 when\nmanufacturing workers were sidelined across the Rust Belt and those last into the\nworkforce bore a disproportionate burden. But those are the workers I hear are most in\ndemand today, as manufacturing plants, hotels, construction sites and restaurants remain\nshort of workers. Recent large company layo� announcements have targeted\nadministrative functions, not front-line workers. These workers may have a lower\npropensity to �le for unemployment, typically are unemployed for shorter periods, and\noften can leverage backup savings to bridge their consumption.\nThe question is whether in�ation can settle while higher-income consumers are still\nspending, and the labor market remains this robust. We will learn a lot more over the next\nfew months.\n\nAs I said earlier, the Fed has raised rates aggressively. But, with forward-looking real rates\nnow positive across the curve, we have been moderating the pace of those increases. Think\n\n\fof it as slowing your boat as you approach the dock. That gives us time to assess the data\non demand and in�ation and determine what more we might need to do.\nI want to reiterate that 2 percent in�ation is our target, and that I am still looking to be\nconvinced of the plausible story that slowing demand returns in�ation relatively quickly to\nthat target. If coming data doesn’t support that story, I’m comfortable doing more. I\nrecognize that creates the risk of a more signi�cant slowdown, but the experience of the\n’70s provides a clear lesson: If you back o� in�ation too soon, in�ation comes back\nstronger, requiring the Fed to do even more, with even more damage. That’s not a risk I\nwant to take.\nSo that’s my story.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2023\n\nInvesting in Rural America Conference\nHotel Roanoke\nRoanoke, Va.\n\n• As I talk to employers considering expansions and as I talk to community leaders\ntrying to recruit �rms, there's an increasing focus on talent.\n• Small towns are going to have to up their games on the attraction, development and\nretention of talent.\n• Small towns in our district are recruiting talent like they cultivate employers: they are\ntelling their stories, making moving easy, creating incentives and strengthening their\nhomegrown workforce pipelines.\n\nThanks for joining us today. At the Richmond Fed, we're committed to understanding the\nunique challenges faced by small towns and rural communities across our district. We are\nconstantly on the ground with local stakeholders in these communities, learning about\ntheir challenges and promising solutions. Once a year, we invite these leaders, along with\nother rural development experts, to share their perspectives on a bigger stage. I hope you\ncome away from this event as energized and recommitted as we do each year.\nOver the last few decades, we've seen small towns struggle, particularly those that lost\nmanufacturers who had historically helped build communities, employ residents and forge\nlocal identities. As a natural reaction, economic development in small town America has\noften focused on replacing those big employers in order to rebuild the tax base and\nreemploy those displaced. These e�orts attracted heavy investment in time and money, but\nsuccess wasn't easy.\nIn the last few years, the focus of recruiting e�orts has shifted. We saw it nationally with\n\n\fAmazon's HQ2 decision a few years ago. When northern Virginia won this very competitive\ncontest, the determining factor didn't seem to be the direct economic incentives but\ninstead the state's workforce and commitment to develop an even stronger employee\npipeline.\nThe same criteria are coming to smaller towns. As I talk to employers considering\nexpansions and as I talk to community leaders trying to recruit �rms, there's an increasing\nfocus on talent. You hear it most clearly in reshoring conversations; businesses question\nhow they could relocate when they don't have con�dence they will �nd the necessary\nworkers.\nThe importance of a robust, reliable labor supply isn't news to small towns. We all know\ntheir challenges in workforce recruitment and development. But, especially now that the\npandemic has tightened the labor market further, smaller communities are going to have\nto �gure out how to put their best foot forward. To win, small towns are going to have to up\ntheir games on the attraction, development and retention of talent. What does that entail?\nOne way that I like to frame this challenge is by comparing it to cultivation of employers.\nSmall towns will need to recruit talent the way they recruit companies, which means\npursuing four strategies.\n\nSmall towns need to tell their stories. The last few years opened a door. Workers seem to\nincreasingly value what small towns o�er — space, a�ordability, the outdoors. And of\ncourse, remote work frees workers to live anywhere. But open doors don't guarantee new\nworkers will walk in. Each town is now competing with every other small town. That's where\nthe story comes in.\nThese stories almost always start with a sense of place, and there are a lot of options. In\nLake City, South Carolina, for example, a nine-day art festival and competition has\nexpanded the creative economy and brought crowds to town. With displays in a wide array\nof local venues, the town isn't just showcasing art, it's showcasing what Lake City has to\no�er.\nOther towns create a sense of place by rehabilitating their downtowns and bringing in\nshopping and restaurants. Danville, here in Virginia, comes to mind. It has developed its\nriverfront, building apartments with nearby dining establishments and creating a lively,\ndowntown feel.\nTowns can leverage nearby amenities. As Fayetteville, West Virginia, transitioned away from\ncoal, it turned to outdoor recreation, which in turn attracted entrepreneurial types who in\nturn created an entrepreneurial culture that persisted.\nIf a town can't tell a story on its own, we are seeing regions work together to bundle one.\nSouthwest Virginia has The Crooked Road heritage music trail, the historic Barter Theatre in\n\n\fAbingdon, the Spearhead Trails for adventure, and wineries, breweries and shopping for\nafter the adventure. In southern West Virginia, we've seen similar e�orts built around the\nHat�eld-McCoy Trails.\nIt's not always about starting something new to create a sense of place but about\nsuccessfully selling what you already are. We'll hear this afternoon from Colleen Roberts\nwho will share on the \"If you build it, will they come?\" panel about how New Bern, North\nCarolina, survived a hurricane and found a compelling way to communicate its story.\nThese stories bring in new talent. But they also help keep kids from moving away. I grew up\nin Tampa. In Tampa, the draw was clear. It's warm. We have beaches. We constantly asked\nourselves: Why would anyone leave? And really only I did.\n\nIn today's world, the ultimate barrier to moving is housing. Every town seeing success is\nexperiencing this challenge. Simply put, the math isn't working to put new residents into\na�ordable homes. We don't have enough supply. And building is getting ever more\nexpensive with construction, interest and labor costs up.\nSmall towns face their own issues. Their housing stock is often less contemporary. Rough\nterrain and absentee landlords often inhibit construction. Developers often have better\noptions elsewhere.\nBut I ask myself: Why can't we change the math? If we can �nd the funding to create\nbuildable sites for businesses, why can't we develop buildable homesites for developers? If\ncities can transform o�ce space into apartments, why can't small towns repurpose their\nold commercial or municipal spaces into residences?\nCarroll County, Virginia, did just that. Working with Virginia Housing Development Authority\nand developer Landmark Asset Services, it transformed a historic high school into 51\na�ordable housing units. The county donated the school. Virginia Housing helped identify\nLandmark as a willing developer and o�ered permanent �nancing at a below-market rate.\nLandmark brought its expertise in adaptive reuse and a�ordable housing development.\nTogether, they made the math work.\nThis afternoon, we will hear from DeWitt House of the Harvest Foundation who will be\nsharing how public-private partnerships can make the math work. They are standing up a\nnew neighborhood with a�ordable housing units in Martinsville, Virginia.\nMaking moving easy (for both workers and their spouses) also means ensuring access to\nhigh-speed, reliable broadband. We've talked about this for years, but the last three years\nreally brought it home. Progress is coming, as the funds provided in the Infrastructure\nInvestment and Jobs Act fully roll out. But the mere existence of funding is not enough — it\nneeds to reach the communities in need. At one of this morning's panels, you can hear\nfrom Heidi Binko of the Just Transition Fund which is focusing on ensuring available public\n\n\ffunding makes it to such communities.\n\nWest Virginia is actually testing out a pretty direct incentive. Through their Ascend West\nVirginia program, they are paying a select set of individuals to move to the state. The\nincentives include $12,000 over the �rst two years, access to free coworking space, and free\noutdoor recreation and gear rental for a year. We're glad to have one of the key architects\nof the program, Danny Twilley, here with us today.\nBut there are other ways to motivate people to join their local workforce.\nLet's start with child care because �nding and paying for high quality child care can become\nso costly it makes more sense for a parent to stay home. United Way of Southwest Virginia\nhas leveraged state and federal funding to expand access to a�ordable child care by\ncreating a new facility, giving technical assistance to existing ones and building up the\nsector's workforce — with the intent that local employers will support these facilities over\ntime. In West Virginia, the Chamber of Commerce worked to get legislation passed last year\nto provide a tax credit to businesses that create a childhood facility on their premises.\nTransportation is also a motivator to connect people to places of employment. It has\nattracted some controversy, but beach communities have transported workers into their\nmarkets for years. The city of Wilson, North Carolina, is trying a more tailored approach; it\nhas partnered with Via Transportation to replace its traditional bus system with an ondemand microtransit service. This allows riders to get curb-to-curb rides for a low price,\nsaving time and expanding access to those who did not previously live near a bus route.\nApproximately half the rides are to or from work.\nCommunities are also tackling more personal barriers to entry, like health or criminal\nrecords. We will hear more in this morning's panel on drawing talent o� the sidelines.\n\nEducation and connecting locals to jobs is an evergreen challenge. But we are seeing a lot\nof innovation in this arena.\nGO TEC (which stands for Great Opportunities in Technology and Engineering Careers) is\nhelping build a pipeline of talent for Virginia's strategic sectors. Hoping to spark early\ninterest, the program exposes middle schoolers to various career pathways, such as\nrobotics and health care, as well as industry jargon and relevant equipment. Once in high\nschool, students have access to industry certi�cation programs, and may then pursue\npostsecondary degrees. Telly Tucker, president of the Institute for Advanced Learning and\nResearch, is a key partner in the e�ort and is on one of our panels this afternoon.\nThe STEM East Network in North Carolina is training the key in�uencers in youth's lives —\neducators — to understand the workforce needs of the region. The hope is they in turn will\n\n\fhelp students visualize what participating in the local labor market could be like.\nThe Surry-Yadkin Works partnership, in North Carolina, allows high school students to\nintern at local companies and access resources at their local community college. Students\nearn a real wage, a transportation subsidy, work experience, and the opportunity to get\ncollege credit and industry-recognized credentials. Nearly 70 percent of participants\ncontinued to work on their internships after �nishing the experience.\nTo close, it's trendy to say that post-COVID-19 we are in a \"new normal.\" But I really do\nthink, when it comes to small town economic development, the ground has shifted. The\nfocus that employers are placing on talent is palpable, and those who can supply that talent\nwill be the winners. The good news is that remote work puts a lot more small towns in the\ncompetitive set, and that small towns o�er a sense of place and community that many of\ntoday's workers want, so long as they can provide the housing, broadband and amenities\nthat these workers need.\nI walked through some promising examples today of how communities are innovating, but\nthere are many more to share, and I look forward to learning from all our panelists. Now I\nwant to turn it over to U.S. Sen. Mark Warner. You all know him well, but I want to thank\nhim for setting me and the Richmond Fed on this journey supporting small towns. In my\n�rst meeting with him, he urged me to dig into the di�erences in economic outcomes\nbetween urban and rural markets, and between similarly situated smaller towns. He\ninspired all we are doing, and I look forward to learning more from him now. Thanks, and\nenjoy the rest of the day.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nSmall Town and Rural Communities\n\nCommunity Development Finance\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\n\fEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2023\n\nThe Virginia Council of CEOs\nUniversity of Richmond\nRichmond, Va.\n\n• The challenge in assessing today’s economy is reconciling the strength of the recent\ndata with the potential for weakness coming from the banking system.\n• It is possible that tightening credit conditions, along with the lagged e�ect of our rate\nmoves, will bring in�ation down relatively quickly. But I still think it could take time\nfor in�ation to return to target.\n• Policy will need to be nimble. If in�ation persists, we can react by raising rates\nfurther. If I am wrong about the pricing dynamics at play, or about credit conditions,\nthen we can respond appropriately.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here today.\nYou follow the news. One of the 20 largest banks, one with heavy sectoral and regional\nexposure, was caught wrongfooted. There was a run on the bank. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) took over in the second largest bank failure in U.S. history.\nDepositors were protected, but it was a shock, nonetheless. In order to control higher-thandesired in�ation, the Fed chose not to back o� its plan to continue tightening. You know\nthis story. But I’m not talking about Silicon Valley Bank. I’m describing the 1988 failure of\nFirst Republic Bank in Texas. There’s no connection to the bank with the same name in the\nnews today.\nWhy do I start with that story? It’s not a perfect historical parallel, but it’s worth\nremembering that not every bank failure becomes Lehman Brothers. We are all\nunderstandably scarred by that memory, but banks have failed throughout our history,\n\n\fmany without creating a broader crisis. Thirty-�ve years later, few of us remember First\nRepublic Bank in Texas (which by the way was also sold to a North Carolina bank — one\nnow called Bank of America).\nHow does that story relate to today? F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote: “The test of a �rst-rate\nintelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time ...” My dad\nput it simpler, saying I “needed to learn to walk and chew gum.” The challenge in assessing\ntoday’s economy is reconciling the strength of the recent data with the potential for\nweakness coming from the banking system. Let me take you through how I am thinking\nabout each, and the potential implications for Fed policy. These are my thoughts alone and\nnot necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s start with the banking system. The past few weeks brought the failure of two banks\noverexposed to crypto, and one with a severe asset/liability duration mismatch. Depositors\ngot nervous and moved with unprecedented speed. The resulting systemic risk brought\nstrong interventions. To mitigate the risk of comparable runs at other banks, the FDIC\nguaranteed all uninsured deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature. To reduce liquidity\nrisk, the Fed Board, with Treasury approval and backstop, created an emergency lending\nfacility particularly attractive to banks holding Treasury and mortgage-backed securities\nwith unrealized losses.\nThe broader implications of these events aren’t yet clear. There are still, to be sure, a few\nindividual banks working through their own issues. But overall deposit �ows appear\nrelatively stable. Banks have worked with intensity to ensure they have adequate liquidity.\nAnd, as I’ve talked to banks in my district, I’ve been encouraged by the resilience I’ve seen.\nBut even resilient banks can impact the broader economy if, to minimize their liquidity risk\nand protect capital, they choose to tighten access to credit. Research shows that such a\npullback would limit consumer spending and curtail business investment. But it is too early\nto know whether that will happen now, or not.\nThese failures hit at a time when economic data was coming in strong. 351,000 jobs were\nadded on average over the past three months — about four times the pace needed to keep\nup with labor force growth. Unemployment remains historically low, at 3.6 percent.\nIn�ation, though down from peak, continues to come in hot. Headline CPI was at 6 percent\nin February, and core was at 5.5 percent. Monetary policy is famously said to work with long\nand variable lags, but our 475 basis points of rate hikes over the past year have not yet\ncompellingly moved in�ation back toward our 2 percent target.\nIt is possible that tightening credit conditions, along with the lagged e�ect of our rate\nmoves, will bring in�ation down relatively quickly. But I still see three reasons why it could\ntake time for in�ation to return to target.\nFirst, the pandemic is still with us. Not the public health crisis, thankfully, but the economic\ndislocation it caused. Over a trillion dollars in excess savings and trillions more in equity\nand housing wealth are funding consumption. Fiscal outlays are continuing, like the\n\n\finfrastructure bill and state tax cuts. Order backlogs are still being worked down.\nInventories remain short in autos and homes, supporting prices in those sectors. The labor\nmarket remains historically tight, as I said earlier, in part because employers who have\nstruggled to �nd workers are reluctant to let them go.\nSecond, �rms and workers are intent on recapturing lost ground. I hear from a number of\nsectors (like health care, utilities and food) that margins have compressed and that they\nnow feel the need to restore them through further price increases. Similarly, workers\nwhose real wages fell are pressing to catch up. Both of these imply further in�ationary\npressure.\nAnd third, and perhaps most fundamentally, two years of high in�ation and ubiquitous\nconversation about in�ation have surely had an impact on �rm behavior. I think about it\nlike this: For a generation, business leaders learned not to count on pricing to drive pro�ts.\nLarge retailers resisted every price increase and had options to redirect their business to\nlower-cost suppliers overseas. Consumers found that they had power as well through priceshopping enabled by e-commerce. The Fed had earned real credibility for its ability to\ndeliver stable prices; you could say we played a role in every wage and every price\nnegotiation.\nBut now pricing is back in play. Its impact is considerable as successful increases �ow\nstraight to the bottom line. Businesses have found inelasticity they hadn’t had the courage\nto test for previously and are looking to �nd more. Supply chain challenges have worn\ndown purchasing departments; they seem now more willing to accept increases, at a time\nwhen volatility has made supplier cost structures more opaque and availability more\nimportant. In most companies, there is a continual tug of war between a �nance team that\nsees price as a path to pro�ts and a sales team that fears loss of business and market\nshare. Sales won for years, but �nance is winning now and will continue to keep pressure\non prices until customers and competitors reassert themselves.\nLet me now turn to our most recent meeting. I saw substantial in�ationary pressure and a\nresilient banking system. So, I supported raising rates 25 basis points. I am heavily\nin�uenced by the experience of the 70s. If you back o� on in�ation too soon, in�ation\ncomes back stronger, requiring the Fed to do even more, with even more damage. With\nin�ation high, broad-based and persistent, I didn’t want to take that risk.\nBut policy will need to be nimble. Most forecasts of our policy path seem to average the risk\nof higher in�ation with the risk of further contagion in banking. I still see the range of\npotential outcomes as pretty wide. If in�ation persists, we can react by raising rates further.\nIt was only a few weeks ago that some were calling for a 50-basis-point increase. And if I am\nwrong about the pricing dynamics at play, or about credit conditions, then we can respond\nappropriately.\nI started by quoting two great Americans: F. Scott Fitzgerald, and my dad. So let me close by\nquoting a third one: Ted Lasso, who said, “There’s two buttons I never like to hit … And\n\n\fthat’s ‘panic’ and ‘snooze.’” So, I am keeping calm in these uncertain times, and watching\ncarefully.\nThanks, and I look forward to your questions and comments.\nIn 1988, 40 bank subsidiaries and one credit card subsidiary of the First RepublicBank\nCorporation in Dallas — the 14th largest bank holding company at the time — failed.\n(Source: FDIC in Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience).\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n\f© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2023\n\n2023 SIEPR Annual Economic Summit\nStanford University\nStanford, Calif.\n\n• The question of when in�ation gets back to normal is an important one for policy.\n• We would all like in�ation to fall quickly back to target. I am con�dent it will in time,\nbut doubtful the process will be quick.\n• I think it will take time to return to target, and, as a consequence, believe we still\nhave work to do.\n\nThis speech was delivered remotely.\nThanks for that nice introduction and for having me here today.\nOne favorite Fed buzzword is “data-dependence,” meaning we adjust our policy based on\nwhat we learn from incoming data. That sounds sensible but isn’t easy. After all, the prints\nwe see largely come in with a month’s delay and can be revised multiple times. So, I spend\na good part of my time outside our building trying to learn by gathering “real-time”\ninformation from businesses, community organizations and groups like the Stanford\nInstitute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR).\nIf you are following the economy closely, you know that recent data has been confusing, so\nI thought I might spend my time today talking about how I am seeing the economy, and the\nimplications for in�ation and for policy. I caution these are my thoughts only and not\nnecessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nIf you were looking at economic data a few weeks ago, the story seemed pretty clear and\nconsistent. Demand was softening. The labor market was cooling. And in�ation was\n\n\fsettling. People were actually starting to imagine we were well on our way to the proverbial\n“soft landing.”\nBut January data is telling a very di�erent story. Consumer spending, job growth and\nin�ation have all accelerated. Is January an aberration, or is the economy actually stronger\nthan we had thought?\nLet’s start with demand. In January, real consumer spending saw the largest monthly\nincrease since March 2021, up 1.1 percent. Real disposable income jumped 1.4 percent as\nJanuary wage and Social Security increases came on line. Real-time information from credit\ncard companies con�rms that consumers spent freely in January. So, I see the jump as real,\nbut doubt that it is as large as portrayed, or is sustainable. The weather has been\nunseasonably warm (everywhere but California), and that likely has goosed spending. And it\nseems clear that the holiday season (with gift cards) has now stretched from two months to\nfour months. Retail sales in October to January grew at only a 2.6 percent annual rate,\nmaking January partly a payback for a weak December. Finally, this data is seasonally\nadjusted, and I do wonder whether the last two year’s January COVID-19 outbreaks didn’t\namplify the strength of this January.\nSeasonal adjustments also matter in the labor market. We saw a huge jobs number in\nJanuary — more than half a million added. But to give you a sense of how these\nadjustments work: Normally employment drops by about 2.9 million in January as holiday\nhiring is reversed. This year, employment dropped only 2.5 million. After adjustment, you\nsee the half million growth number. Is it likely that, in today’s labor market, employers were\nmore reluctant to shed workers than in previous years? I think so.\nBut that said, the labor market is still quite tight. The unemployment rate is 3.4 percent, a\n54-year low. Employers tell me they aren’t as desperate as they were a year ago, but it is\nstill di�cult to �nd workers. I hear that particularly for skilled trades like nursing,\nconstruction and mechanics.\nThere have been a number of layo� announcements recently, particularly here, but I would\nnote they have been disproportionately professionals rather than frontline workers.\nRepotting is never easy, but unemployment for those with a college degree is quite low: 2\npercent. That suggests whatever labor market adjustments are required may come with\nless of a price than prior downturns. We aren’t likely to repeat the Great Recession’s painful\nRust Belt construction and manufacturing challenges.\nFinally, let’s spend some time on in�ation. After several months on a downward path,\nin�ation accelerated in January, in both month-over-month and year-over-year terms. And\nthe encouraging fourth quarter in�ation numbers were revised upward. Is this just a blip on\nthe path back to our 2 percent target? Or a signal that we still have a long way to go?\nThe question of when in�ation gets back to normal is an important one for policy, so I want\nto spend some time on it. Some believe this will happen pretty quickly. Until a recent\nupward spurt, that’s where markets were. And, ahead of the most recent in�ation data, the\n\n\faverage respondent in the Survey of Professional Forecasters projected in�ation at 2.6\npercent annualized by the fourth quarter of this year. Why may you expect a quick return\nto normal?\nYou might hang your hat on the transitory concept. Transitory has two di�erent de�nitions:\nbrief, and not permanent. In�ation certainly hasn’t been brief, but maybe getting to the\nother side just takes time. After all, supply chain issues are easing. Most people are back to\nwork. Transportation costs have come down. Broad commodity price in�ation has returned\nto pre-pandemic levels. And �scal stimulus is waning. If in�ation was largely physical or\n�scal-driven, then it could decline pretty quickly as we return to normal.\nOr you might think the Fed’s rate hikes and balance sheet reductions thus far are su�cient\nbut will take e�ect with the usual delay. Our moves impact �nancial conditions fairly quickly\nbut take time to work their way through the real economy. If we’ve hiked enough, as we\nmake our way through that lag, in�ation could quickly fall. After all, liquidity is leaving the\nsystem, the housing boom has subsided, demand is likely normalizing and wages are\nsettling.\nOr you could even believe the Fed is going to do more than we have signaled to date and is\nplanning to clamp down in an even more aggressive manner, risking a deep recession, to\nsnap in�ation down quickly. Volcker proved we have this power should we want to use it.\nTo be clear, I have not seen anyone suggest in�ation has yet become the problem Volcker\nfaced in the early 1980s.\nBy this point, you might have gathered that I don’t think normalization will be this easy.\nReturning prices to the stability of the last 30 years will likely take a lot more time and\ne�ort. I think my view is in step with the actions of the Federal Open Market Committee\n(and with the most recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) that showed in�ation\nnot returning to 2 percent until 2025). Why do I see this �ght lasting longer?\nPartly because some of the dislocations we saw in the pandemic are enduring. Over a\ntrillion in excess savings are still funding consumption, as are continuing �scal outlays like\nthe infrastructure bill. New auto inventories and houses for sale remain near historic lows,\nsupporting prices in those sectors. Supply chain challenges remain, for example, in\nswitchgears and cabinets. The labor market remains historically tight, as I said earlier. And\nChina’s reopening and events in Ukraine may well also pressure commodity prices.\nAdditional in�ationary pressure comes from �rms and workers trying to recapture lost\nground. I hear from a number of sectors (like health care, utilities and food) whose margins\nhave compressed and who feel the need to restore them through further price increases.\nThey will presumably be motivated to move more aggressively than those sectors whose\nmargins improved and who may eventually be pushed by their customers to give on price.\nSimilarly, workers whose real wages fell are pressing to catch up. I’ve heard of many largerthan-normal increases in the end-of-year merit process.\nAnd I’d also point to in�ation expectations. While they remain well anchored on average,\n\n\fthere’s been enough movement under the surface to warrant caution. The University of\nMichigan Survey of Consumers has seen the one-year median expected in�ation rate fall\nfrom its pandemic high of 5.4 percent to 4.1 percent in the most recent reading. But this\nmasks an increase in the range of responses. By one measure, that spread is at levels last\nseen in 1982. And research on the ’70s found that an increase in the standard deviation of\nin�ation expectations preceded high and unanchored in�ation expectations. It’s worth\nremembering that even with Volcker’s aggressive approach, it took years to corral\nexpectations back to a narrow range. While his era was certainly di�erent (unanchored\nexpectations, no target, higher in�ation), it took until 1983 to get in�ation below 4 percent\nand 1986 to get to 2 percent.\nMost fundamentally, two years of high in�ation, and ubiquitous conversation about\nin�ation, has surely had an impact on �rm behavior. I think about it like this: For a\ngeneration, business leaders have learned not to count on pricing to drive pro�ts. Large\nretailers (like Walmart or Home Depot) resisted every price increase with fervor and had\noptions to redirect their business to lower-cost suppliers overseas. Consumers found that\nthey had power as well through price-shopping enabled by e-commerce. The Fed had\nearned real credibility for its ability to deliver stable prices; you could say we played a role\nin every wage and every price negotiation.\nNow, pricing is back in play. Its impact is considerable: Successful increases �ow straight to\nthe bottom line. Businesses have found inelasticity they hadn’t had the courage to test for\npreviously and are looking to �nd more. Supply chain challenges have worn down\npurchasing departments; they seem now more willing to accept increases, at a time when\nvolatility has made supplier cost structures more opaque and availability more important.\nIn most companies, there is a continual tug of war between a �nance team that sees price\nas a path to pro�ts and a sales team that fears loss of business and market share. Sales\nwon for years, but �nance is winning now and will continue to keep pressure on prices until\ncustomers and competitors reassert themselves.\nMonetary policy plays an important role here. We have raised rates and reduced our\nbalance sheet aggressively in the last year in an e�ort to bring demand and supply back\ninto balance. In�ation is likely past peak. But I think it will take time to return to target, and,\nas a consequence, believe we still have work to do. We have forecasted additional rate\nincreases and the SEP has made clear that we don’t anticipate rate cuts this year.\nThe Fed’s objective isn’t to hurt the economy, it’s to reduce in�ation. And if there is one\nthing we’ve relearned over the last two years, it is that everybody hates in�ation. High\nin�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it becomes unclear when to spend,\nwhen to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It takes e�ort to shop around for\nbetter prices or to handle complaints from unhappy customers. And in�ation feels unfair —\nthe wage increase you earned feels arbitrarily taken away at the gas pump.\nThe Fed is the organization charged with �ghting in�ation, and we have made our resolve\nclear. The experience of the ’70s is compelling. If you back o� on in�ation too soon, it\n\n\fcomes back stronger, requiring the Fed to do even more, with even more damage. I’d like to\navoid that.\nBut with real rates having risen dramatically in the last year, and sitting at positive levels\nacross the curve, it makes sense to move more deliberately than we did last year. Here’s\nwhere I come back to data dependence. If I’m right and in�ation persists, we can react by\nraising rates further. And, of course, I’d be happy to be wrong.\nWe would all like in�ation to fall quickly back to target. I am con�dent it will in time but\ndoubtful the process will be quick. But I should close by reminding you that in�ation doesn’t\ncome from statisticians but from the sum of individual actions. (So, if any of you in the\naudience have a price increase in the works, feel free to help us all out by backing o�.)\nWith that, I am looking forward to your questions and input.\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n\n\f(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

I enjoy these January economic outlook conferences.\nThe timing is great to re�ect on the past year and then look forward. So, I will try to share\nmy re�ections on both, with a particular emphasis on the Fed and the economy. These are\nmy thoughts alone, and not those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nA year ago, the economy was booming. GDP grew 5.7 percent year-over-year in the fourth\nquarter of 2021, driven by the post-COVID-19 reopening, and the deployment of excess\n\n\fsavings built from �scal stimulus, suppressed pandemic-era spending and equity\nappreciation. The unemployment rate was at 4 percent, on its way to matching its 50-year\nlow. In�ation, on the other hand, was 6.1 percent headline and 5.2 percent core; it had\nsustained, broadened and become a problem.\nDuring the pandemic, the Fed supported demand by taking rates to zero and buying\ntrillions in government bonds. But at our December 2021 meeting, we announced the\ntapering of our asset purchase program and forecasted the start of rate increases in 2022.\nIt was time to prioritize containing in�ation.\nAnd that’s what we did last year. We started raising rates in March, accelerated the pace\nduring the summer and have now moved the overnight rate to 4.3 percent. That is the\nfastest tightening pace in 40 years. We also started reducing our balance sheet this\nsummer; it is down over $400 billion from its peak with more to come.\nWhy did the Fed move so aggressively? Well, the logic was straightforward. With in�ation so\nhigh and demand so strong, it made no sense to keep stimulating the economy. Doing so\ncould further put in�ation expectations at risk. So, we removed that stimulus as fast as we\nthought we could.\nBut I’d also make the case on an emotional level. Last year reminded all of us how much we\nhate in�ation. In�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it becomes unclear\nwhen to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It takes e�ort to\nshop around for better prices or to handle complaints from unhappy customers. And\nin�ation feels unfair — the wage increase you earned feels arbitrarily taken away at the gas\npump. We all hate in�ation and — when I look in the mirror — I ask, “If the Fed doesn’t do\nsomething about it, who will?”\nSo how is it working?\nMonetary policy works most directly through �nancial markets. As borrowing becomes\nmore costly, capital investment slows. So does consumer spending, especially in interestsensitive sectors like housing, auto and consumer durables. The dollar strengthens,\nlowering export demand and import prices. All these e�ects have been substantial. The\ndollar and the euro are now close to parity. Investment in structures is down. Mortgage\nrates more than doubled last year, bringing the housing market down from its pandemic\nhigh. Asset valuations have dropped, without any signi�cant structural market disruptions.\nDemand reduction in less interest-sensitive segments tends to take a bit longer. And\nremember that the pandemic era is still partly with us. Excess savings and the return of\nconsumer borrowing to pre-pandemic levels are funding continued strong consumption,\nespecially for services like travel. Billions in �scal appropriations are still being distributed.\nStrong pandemic-era order pipelines and the need for inventory replenishment are\nsustaining businesses. Employers who fought hard to hire scarce workers are reluctant to\n�re them. The unemployment rate remains at the historically low rate of 3.5 percent (and\nwe are still adding jobs, 223,000 in the December report).\n\n\fOnce demand weakens, studies estimate it can take another six to 12 months before those\npullbacks quiet the rate of in�ation. So, with demand slowing but resilient, labor markets\nhealthy, and the added and enduring shock of the war in Ukraine, it shouldn’t be a surprise\nthat in�ation — while likely past peak — is still elevated. The 12-month headline PCE\nremains at 5.5 percent, and the core is at 4.7 percent. Wage gains are still higher than prepandemic levels.\nWhere is the Fed headed next?\nLet me start by saying we still have work to do. In�ation is too high, and we will need to stay\non the case until it is sustainably back to our 2 percent target. We have forecasted\nadditional rate increases this year.\nThat said, we have slowed the pace of those increases. We moved quickly last year, but\nwhat we were doing was taking our foot o� the gas. Now, with forward-looking real rates\npositive across the curve and therefore our foot unequivocally on the brake, it makes sense\nto steer more deliberately as we work to bring in�ation down in the context of the lags I\njust discussed.\nTo that end, the last three months’ in�ation prints have been a step in the right direction,\nbut I would caution that while the average dropped, the median stayed high. That’s because\nthe average was distorted by declining prices for goods like used cars that escalated\nunsustainably during the pandemic. I saw one commentary celebrating that core CPI less\nshelter actually declined. But we all know what people care most about: food and gas and\nshelter.\nWith the Fed resolute on in�ation, that brings me to the outlook for the economy.\nThis has been the most predicted potential recession in memory. But, despite some scares\nearlier in the year, the data we’ve seen on spending, investment and employment keep\npushing the timeline out —unless you are in housing or sell into a low-income customer\nbase, or are a deal maker or are dependent on digital advertising.\nIn the rest of the economy, �rms know the Fed is taking strong action to combat in�ation\nand realize that creates downturn risk. They believe many of the arti�cial elements\nsupporting consumer spending will likely wane over time. They have updated their\nRecession Playbooks and may even be working the items on the �rst page, like headcount\nfreezes or discretionary spend reductions. But most haven’t turned the pages yet given\ntheir demand remains solid.\nBut they might. Perhaps because in�ation remains stubbornly high and requires more from\nus. Perhaps because a sector moves in unison as recently happened in tech. Or perhaps\nbecause of unexpected outside events like those that drove the last three recessions.\nI get a lot of questions about whether the Fed should remain this committed given that risk.\nI guess my simple answer is that everyone hates in�ation, and we are the ones mandated\nto address it. The Fed’s objective isn’t to hurt the economy; it’s to reduce in�ation.\n\n\fThe experience of the ’70s showed that if you back o� on in�ation too soon, it comes back\nstronger, requiring the Fed to do even more, with even more damage. If you change the\ntarget before it is achieved, as some have recently advocated, you put the Fed’s credibility\nat risk, which in turn increases the sacri�ce required in order to control in�ation. And if you\nthink supply chain improvements and our actions to date are enough to bring in�ation\ndown quickly, then our more gradual rate path should limit the harm.\nAnd I should use this moment to remind you that in�ation doesn’t come from statisticians.\nIt comes from the sum of actions of individual �rms. (So, if any of you in the audience have\na price increase in the works, feel free to help us all out by backing o�.)\nI like analogies, and one that hit me recently was hiking down a narrow trail after having\nclimbed a mountain. The peak of course being in�ation. You are tired. If you go too fast,\nyou could easily slip; so you move deliberately. There’s always a chance a storm could come\nup and muddy the trail. A path that seems solid could give way, forcing you to an\nalternative route. But you know your map is good, your tools are high-quality and there’s\nstill a lot of daylight left. So, like you, I’m looking forward to getting down this particular\nmountain, and telling the story of how we did it — preferably in front of a warm �re.\nWith that, let me open it up for questions and comments.\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2023\n\nThe Richmond Fed has a beautiful building in downtown Richmond. It’s in a great location,\noverlooking the river, and serves as a focal point for collaboration, mentorship and\nconnection. But physically, it is quite literally an ivory tower. As we try to assess the macro\nforces a�ecting the economy, we don’t want our thinking to match the exterior of our\nbuilding.\nSo, we have oriented the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond outward. My colleagues and I\nare on the ground in the Fifth District constantly, meeting and learning from community\nmembers. Last year, we had over 1,700 engagements with external contacts — with\nbankers, business and community leaders, workers and public o�cials. These meetings\ntake us to every corner of our district — you can see on this map where I’ve been in the last\nfew years.\nI’ve been on the other side of these conversations. During my time in business in Atlanta, I\ngained a lot from interacting with the Atlanta Fed and Dennis Lockhart (the president at\nthat time). I learned from them, and hoped I helped them learn a little something too.\nBut this kind of high-touch outreach requires time and e�ort. And — perhaps most\nimportantly — it relies on the generosity of community members to share their time and\nperspective with us. Why go to all this e�ort?\n\nTake consumer demand. Overall, it looks solid, but conversations with retailers in our\ndistrict have helped us understand the nuance. Lower-price retailers tell us their customers\nhave pulled back amid in�ation and recession fears. As lower-income consumers are\nsqueezed on the essentials, say at the pump and the grocery store, their demand for items\nlike washing machines and TVs has dropped. In contrast, higher-priced retailers are still\nseeing wealthier consumers spend.\n\n\fOur conversations also help us see di�erences across geography more clearly than if we\nonly relied on local statistics, which often come with a lag and high margins of error. Take\nthis recent post-pandemic recovery period. Foot tra�c was back in South Carolina long\nbefore it returned in the District of Columbia. But we haven’t just learned about when areas\nrecovered, we’ve also gotten insight into the nature of their recovery. For example, a\nbusiness serving restaurants in the D.C. area told one of my colleagues that lunch demand\nhas still not recovered, likely given continuing remote work in the DMV area.\n\nFor example, why has the labor market stayed tight — even as rates have risen, sentiment\nhas fallen and the economy has slowed? On the demand side, employers tell us they are\nreluctant to let go of workers they fought for months to hire. They don’t want to lose them\nunless absolutely necessary.\nOn the supply side, we hear about workers facing new challenges that keep them from\nwork even as pandemic-related barriers fade. We saw this up close in a recent visit to\nsouthern Virginia (part of our Community Conversations event series which allows us to dig\nin deeply to local economies). My colleagues and I learned that the escalating costs of gas,\nhousing and child care have raised the barriers to working, even as wages have been rising.\nThis may be particularly problematic in rural areas given the distances required to drive to\nwork and the challenges providing basic services in less dense areas.\n\nThe national data we get comes a month late and can be revised multiple times over the\nnext year. It is far from de�nitive on what is happening in real time, so we supplement it\nwith conversations with our contacts who help us better understand how things are\nchanging.\nFor instance, in market outreach, we saw early signs of the housing market turn when\ncontacts shared that furniture sales had started to recede. And outside residential, we’ve\nheard about more projects in the commercial real estate space being put into “wait and\nsee” mode and many being canceled outright.\nBut we aren’t just relying on anecdotes. Our team �elds rigorous economic\nsurveys throughout our district. Take our monthly manufacturing and non-manufacturing\nsurveys — the two that probably get the most attention. The labor market has been tight\nacross the board, but they helped us spot a subtle shift. At the beginning of the year, �rms\nreported that it was relatively more di�cult to �ll low- to –mid-skill jobs than higher-skill\npositions. More recently, we are hearing that it is now harder to �ll mid- to –high-skill jobs,\nincluding everything from roles that require a CDL for truck driving to roles like marketing\nexecutives and accountants.\n\n\fWe �nd this especially important for small towns and rural communities. The data reports\nthat these communities are falling behind in employment, health and education. On-theground conversations allow us to understand what is being done to improve these\noutcomes.\nFor example, one underlying gap is access to capital. Our community development team\nhas heard about the challenges preparing for and absorbing capital. We saw this in the\nearly days of COVID-19, as communities told us they weren’t resourced to access even basic\nrelief funding. But we’ve also found people throughout our district working on creative\nsolutions to increase local capacity. These initiatives include investing in intermediary\norganizations, o�ering technical assistance and creating mentorship opportunities for\naspiring leaders. We shared these �ndings at our 2022 Investing in Rural America\nConference. We are already looking forward to our 2023 conference, where we hope to\nkeep learning and sharing.\n\nWe have 14 Community Conversations scheduled for the year ahead and our team will\nhave hundreds of touch points with business and community leaders throughout the Fifth\nDistrict. Here’s what I’ll be watching:\nIs in�ation calming? Are consumers slowing spending? Are supply issues resolving? What are\nbusiness leaders’ attitudes toward pricing? How are consumers reacting to higher prices?\nIs the labor market cooling? Will we see layo�s spread beyond housing and tech? Will those\non the sidelines �nally come back into the workforce? Will compensation increases\ncontinue, or slow?\nAre we headed for a recession? Businesses seem to have pulled out and updated their\nrecession playbooks. What happens next? Do they turn the pages in the book, or return it\nto the shelf?\nHow much of the pandemic economy sticks around? Do the sectors that bene�tted from\nCOVID-19 (e.g., recreational goods) get a permanent boost? How will commercial centers\nevolve in the context of hybrid work?\nWe will �nd answers to these questions (and likely learn of new ones) as we meet with\nmembers of our community this year. Thanks to all of you who have given and plan to give\nyour time, thoughts and insights. We value and depend on you greatly.\n\n\fSmall Town and Rural Communities\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\n2022 Virginia Economic Summit and Forum on International Trade\nGreater Richmond Convention Center\nRichmond, Va.\n\n• Our economy has operated with a growing labor force for decades. This excess labor\nworld kept wages and bene�ts, and e�ectively cost-push in�ation, down.\n• That’s certainly not the world we �nd ourselves in now. And labor supply looks like it\nwill remain constrained.\n• Fewer workers would constrain our growth and pressure in�ation until businesses\nand governments can deliver productivity enhancements and/or structure incentives\nto bring more workers into the workforce.\n• Increasingly, I fear we are moving to an environment where labor is short, not long.\nThat situation can be managed, as other countries have proven, but it requires real\nintentionality.\n\nThe following text was prepared prior to the BLS Employment Situation release on December 2,\n2022.\nThanks for that nice introduction. As you know, the Fed’s dual mandate is to promote stable\nprices and maximum employment. Over the last year, that �rst goal – stable prices – has\nbeen front and center. But this is an economic development conference, so it seems right\nfor me to focus on the second part of the mandate today and talk about how we get our\neconomy to its full employment potential. I should note these views are mine alone and not\nnecessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s start with the workforce before COVID. It seemed amazingly healthy. We added jobs\nevery month after 2010. In the months before the pandemic, the unemployment rate hit\n\n\f50-year lows. And despite projections that demographics were working against us, labor\nforce participation kept improving as the strong labor market pulled people o� the\nsidelines.\nThen COVID hit. In a two-month span, we lost nearly 22 million jobs -- the deepest drop on\nrecord. The unemployment rate hit 14.7 percent in April 2020. Participation fell over three\npercentage points, to levels last seen in the early 1970s.\nBut the economy bounced back, supported by historic levels of �scal and monetary\nstimulus. Unemployment dropped and is now basically at pre-pandemic levels. Yet\nparticipation was slow to return. At �rst, that seemed to be due to sickness and\nquarantining, child care responsibilities, and enhanced unemployment bene�ts. But even\nonce the economy and schools reopened, vaccines rolled out, bene�ts ceased, and wages\nincreased signi�cantly, participation remained stubbornly below its pre-COVID levels.\nThe result has been unprecedented labor market tightness. Job openings have hit record\nhighs. Businesses have struggled to hold on to or �nd enough workers, especially in\nindustries with lower pay and less attractive jobs. This issue is particularly pronounced in\nskilled trades, like nursing or welding or truck driving. In November 2021, the quits rate\nreached a new record. In March, we reached two open jobs for every unemployed person.\nWe are not far from that high today.\nThis labor shortage has helped feed in�ation. The Personal Consumption Expenditures\nPrice Index is at 6.0 percent headline and 5.0 percent core, near 40-year highs.\nThe Fed has taken aggressive action to bring in�ation under control, raising the fed funds\nrate steeply to just under 4 percent and making clear our intent to do more. Even so, we\nhave seen labor demand continue to run ahead of supply.\nWe added 261,000 jobs in October, over two times the breakeven level of workforce\ngrowth. The unemployment rate was still at a historically low 3.7 percent. Despite recent\nnews from the tech sector, layo�s remain muted as businesses seem reluctant to shed\nworkers they have fought hard to hire. Wages in nominal terms were up over 14 percent\nfrom their pre-pandemic level and up 4.7 percent year over year. In the decade prior to the\npandemic, their growth averaged 2.4 percent. And participation? Participation hasn’t moved\nmeaningfully since the beginning of this year and last month moved to 62.2, well short of\nthe 63.4 percent of February 2020.\n\nOur economy has operated with a growing labor force for decades. We bene�tted from the\nbaby boom, from women more fully entering the workforce, from increased educational\nattainment making more people ready for more jobs, from better health allowing workers\nto work longer, and from historically high levels of immigration. All of these were\nsupplemented by access to ever growing pools of o�shore, low-cost labor.\n\n\fBusinesses adapted, as you might expect. They chose to hire from outside rather than grow\ntheir own; for example, the huge and attractive bank training programs of my era were\nlargely eliminated in the ’90s when banks realized the market had surplus bankers. Firms\ngot more comfortable with higher attrition sta�ng models, reoriented toward part-time\nwork and outsourcing, and became more willing to do layo�s rather than commit to job\nsecurity. They reduced retirement and health care bene�ts.\nThis excess labor world kept wages and bene�ts, and e�ectively cost-push in�ation, down.\nLabor share of income dropped. This was good for businesses and good for investors. It\nwas less good for the existing workforce.\nNow, there were many predictions over the last 10 years that as baby boomers aged, we\nwould see participation reverse its positive trend. But, as I said earlier, in the recent\nhistorically long upturn, we saw participation overperform. Perhaps the sheer duration of\nthat upturn brought hesitant people on the margin back to work. Or maybe the Great\nRecession forced near-retirees to work longer. Or perhaps the rise of certi�cate programs\nbetter connected workers to the workforce. And don’t forget the growth of the gig\neconomy. Regardless, the net was – despite some complaints at the end – labor was fully\navailable. Wage growth was relatively modest.\nThat’s certainly not the world we �nd ourselves in now.\nIt’s possible that labor force participation will recover — in time — to our pre-pandemic\nnormal. But what if it doesn’t? What if the aberration isn’t today but instead the abovetrend participation at the end of the last upturn? There are many reasons to think that\nmight be the case.\nThe growth of the working-age population is relatively straightforward to forecast, and\npredictions aren’t good. Fertility rates are down, and that trend would take a generation to\nreverse. My generation, the baby boomers, are aging out of the workforce, and the many\nretirements we saw during the pandemic are unlikely to come back. As of October, we were\nstill down about 1.4 million older workers. Immigration policy also looks unlikely to\nmaterially change any time soon. As of October, we were missing about half a million\nprime-age immigrants versus our 10-year pre-COVID trend. O�shoring has been\ncomplicated by increasing wages in developing countries and heightened awareness of the\nrisk of being dependent on foreign labor sources.\nAnd participation is clearly challenged too. COVID has had to have had some impact,\nespecially given the added pressure of child care and elder care. This seems most\npronounced for working class women, who may no longer be able to make the math work\nto stay in the labor force, and for the many recent retirees taking care of their parents,\nspouses or grandkids.\nSo, labor supply looks like it will remain constrained. And the Fed’s e�orts to bring demand\nback into balance won’t be easy when Americans still have about $1.3 trillion more in\nsavings than they did pre-pandemic and �scal stimulus continues -- for example, the\n\n\foutlays coming from the infrastructure package.\n\nFewer workers would constrain our growth and pressure in�ation until businesses and\ngovernments can deliver productivity enhancements and/or structure incentives to bring\nmore workers into the workforce.\nAs I travel my district, I hear many initiatives already underway to bring people o� the\nsidelines. I’ve talked to a steel company that invested in full-time recruiters and a tool\ndistributor that started its own soft-skills training program. I’ve talked to a poultry provider\nthat has widened the pro�les of who they are open to hiring, dropping drug tests and\nbackground checks. Employers are reconsidering working conditions, revising schedules\nand redesigning jobs to better match worker preferences. They are investing in\npartnerships with community colleges to better attract and develop skilled trades.\nParticularly intriguing have been initiatives to provide child care or housing support for\nemployees, taking a more active role in tackling barriers to work. I’m reminded of what\nused to happen in company towns the last time labor was this short in the early ’50s, when\nemployers attracted workers by investing in the broader environment, including housing\nand amenities.\nBut not all responses will be good for workers. I talked to a fast-food brand that described\nhow automation and robotics could reduce store sta�ng by half. Employers who pay more\nwill demand higher productivity or raise prices, thereby lessening demand and eventually\njobs. You are seeing lower service standards already, e.g., hotels lessening their cleaning\nprotocols or restaurants taking your order via QR code. We may see an increase in\no�shoring to markets without geopolitical pressures. All of these are particularly\nthreatening to the last people into the workforce who might �nd entry is more of a\nmountain to climb with entry-level jobs increasingly scarce.\nGovernments and nonpro�ts will want to think through how they approach this as well.\nConstrained longer-term economic growth isn’t good for our tax base, our competitiveness\nor our workers in the longer run. They should be exploring policies that work the supply\nside by encouraging workforce participation and preparation.\nCanada’s prime-age women’s participation grew over �ve points in the 20 years before the\npandemic, while the U.S. rate dropped nearly a full point. Research from the San Francisco\nFed points to parental leave policies in the two countries as a key di�erentiator. The same\nresearch highlights �exible work arrangements as a driver of increased women’s\nparticipation in other industrialized countries. And the two countries tax second earners\nmuch di�erently as well.\nSimilarly, between 2000 and 2019, the employment-to-population ratio for Japanese adults\nages 60 to 64 increased 19.3 percentage points to 70.3 percent. For context, the U.S. ratio\nwas 56 percent. Japan (where population is, to be fair, healthier) has pursued several\npolicies to increase employment of older workers, including subsidies and pushback\n\n\fagainst mandatory retirement ages. It has �elded a training program for employers on how\nto make jobs friendlier for older workers.\nThese ideas are worth exploring in the U.S. Additionally, it is worth exploring increased legal\nimmigration, bringing those with skills, work ethic and entrepreneurship into our\nworkforce. On participation, there could be signi�cant leverage in further investment in\neducation, job training, licensing capacity and rehabilitation, as well as in reimagining the\nchild and elder care industries and in exploring bene�t and tax policy changes that could\nincent further workforce participation.\nTo sum it up, COVID has caused businesses, governments and – yes – even economists to\nreassess their assumptions on the labor market. Increasingly, I fear we are moving to an\nenvironment where labor is short, not long. That situation can be managed, as other\ncountries have proven, but it requires real intentionality. With that, I welcome your\nquestions and comments.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nTechnology Enabled Disruption Conference\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAtlanta, Ga.\n\n• The economy has seen a number of disin�ationary innovations in recent years.\nThese innovations put “the wind at our back” when it came to containing in�ation.\n• But we've been through quite a storm over the last two years, and it is appropriate to\nask whether anything has changed and if the wind has shifted in a more in�ationary\ndirection.\n• We’ve seen vulnerabilities associated with a globally complex supply chain,\ninvestments in renewable energy, and changing demographics that may shift labor\nfrom being abundant to being scarce, all of which could result in rising cost\npressures.\n• It’s possible that we could return to pre-pandemic wind conditions, but what if we\nare in a new era – one in which we face in�ationary headwinds?\n• Our goal, 2 percent target in�ation, wouldn’t change, nor would our longer-run ability\nto meet that goal, but the appropriate path to achieve it could.\n\nThanks to all of you for joining us in Atlanta today. We started this conference four years\nago, the year I joined the Fed after a 30-year business career. It’s hard to remember today,\nbut a core topic for the Fed back then was why in�ation had remained below our 2 percent\ntarget for so long. Along with Rob Kaplan and others, I thought real economic innovations\nwere playing an important role, which you could particularly see in over 20 years of goods\ndisin�ation. Today, as we are emerging from the pandemic with broad-based and high\nin�ation, I want to talk a bit about how I am updating my thinking on the relationship\nbetween technological innovation, the economy and monetary policy moving forward. As\n\n\falways, the views here are my own and not those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem or on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe economy has seen a number of disin�ationary innovations in recent years. Ecommerce grew signi�cantly over the last decade, lowering barriers to price comparisons\nand cutting costs for retailers. Fracking provided greater access to natural gas and oil,\nreducing energy prices. The procurement discipline became professionalized and\npressured suppliers to o�er ever-lower prices to �rms, thereby reducing costs to\nconsumers. Employers gained market power and used that to limit wage growth, as studied\nin the manufacturing sector by Richmond Fed economists. Automation reduced labor cost\npressures by increasing workforce productivity. And the rise of global supply chains\nenabled �rms to o�shore materials and services, lowering the cost of both products and\nlabor.\nWhether you loved these developments or hated them, these innovations – for any given\npolicy stance – put “the wind at our back” when it came to containing in�ation. But we've\nbeen through quite a storm over the last two years, and it is appropriate to ask whether\nanything has changed. Have the winds shifted in a more in�ationary direction, and if so,\nwhat are the implications?\nMuch has changed. Tari�s, the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed the\nvulnerabilities of globally complex supply chains. If countries and companies rethink their\ntrading relationships, we are likely to see higher costs and eventually higher prices.\nSimilarly, we may well see �rms reorient their procurement strategies to prioritize\nresiliency, not just e�ciency, resulting in higher ongoing cost pressures as well.\nInvestments in renewable energy and energy security could elevate costs too – at least\nduring the transition.\nAnd changing demographics, including lower birth rates, an aging population and\ndecreased immigration, may shift labor from being abundant to being scarce. While not\ntechnological in nature, these changes could give more power to workers to command\nhigher wages. We are also seeing labor productivity challenges as �rms struggle to �ll open\njobs and �nd their new hires require more training and support.\nAll that said, I don’t want to declare a long-term shift in the prevailing winds when we still\ndon’t know exactly how the pandemic era will play out. Some changes may reverse in time\n— countries and companies notoriously have short memories. And never count\ndisin�ationary forces out. The pandemic accelerated e-commerce, so maybe its\nenablement of price shopping will spread even faster. New technologies can always come\nalong in the way that fracking did. Pressure on labor could accelerate investments in\nproductivity, furthering technologies such as arti�cial intelligence and robotics. Remote\nwork — one of the themes of this conference — could increase the potential supply of\nlabor for certain jobs and thereby reduce wages. And as businesses con�gure to enable\nmore remote work, they might actually increase their openness to more o�shoring. Or\n\n\fperhaps government policies will deliver increased labor participation, as Japan has done to\nincrease the participation rates of older workers.\nSo, it is of course possible that we could return to pre-pandemic wind conditions. But what\nif we are in a new era — one in which we face in�ationary headwinds? What would that\ndisruption mean for our ability to meet our in�ation mandate? Our goal, 2 percent target\nin�ation, wouldn’t change, nor would our longer-run ability to meet that goal, but the\nappropriate path to achieve it could.\nWe would be more likely to face periods with real forces imparting near-term in�ationary\npressures. Consequently, history may be less of a precedent for appropriate policy. These\npressures could make “looking through” short-term shocks more di�cult. They could make\ngradual rate increase paths less e�ective. They could make market functioning\ninterventions somewhat trickier. As a result, our e�orts to stabilize in�ation expectations\ncould require periods where we tighten monetary policy more than has been our recent\npattern. You might think of this as leaning against the wind. Doing so would be consistent\nwith our �exible average in�ation targeting framework.\nCommunicating e�ectively could also prove more challenging. Over the last 10 years, our\nin�ation and employment goals have not been in con�ict while making policy. As such, the\nFed’s decisions have been relatively easy to explain. But in�ationary pressure could revive\nthe traditional Phillips curve trade-o� between employment and in�ation. We will need to\nbe crystal clear that a growing economy and maximum employment require stable prices\nand that we will remain committed to addressing in�ationary gusts.\nWe don’t need to make any of these judgments now. It is notoriously di�cult to pinpoint\nshifts in the weather, and the old joke is that economic forecasting was invented to make\nweather forecasters look good. The same could likely be said about predicting the next big\nthing in technology.\nTechnological innovations pop up every day and, in time, may well impact us in ways we\nhaven’t yet anticipated. That’s why the Richmond Fed continues to sponsor this conference\nand to dig into the impacts of technology-enabled disruption on the broader economy. To\nborrow from the conference theme, today is a great opportunity to learn from the\npandemic and evaluate the path ahead. Thanks for having me and enjoy the conference.\nChen Yeh, Claudia Macaluso, and Brad Hershbein, \"Monopsony in the US Labor Market,\" July\n2022.\n\n\fProduction and Investment\n\nIn�ation\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

It is worth asking:\nwhat happened?\n• It’s part COVID and supply imbalances. It’s part �scal. And it’s part monetary.\nMovements in any of these factors could have quieted in�ation somewhat. But I’m\nnot convinced any one of them is the whole story. For me, it’s the accumulation of so\nmany in�ationary pressures at once that likely tells the tale.\n• The question is how long this can last. Persistence is the essence of in�ation.\nBusiness leaders still see it as an episode, not a regime change. The water in the river\nmay be high but it hasn’t yet breached the dam the Fed built to keep in�ation\nexpectations in line with our 2 percent target.\n• In�ation should come down. But I don’t expect its drop to be immediate nor\npredictable. We’ve been through multiple shocks, and signi�cant shocks simply take\ntime to dampen.\n• The Fed has the tools to bring in�ation down and will persist until it does.\n\nThanks for having me. Today, I want to talk about the economy, but I also want to take a\nstep back and re�ect on how we got here and where we might be headed. These views are\nmine alone and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI think you all know where the economy is today. We’ve seen a historically strong recovery\nfrom the short but deep 2020 recession. GDP surpassed its pre-pandemic level in the �rst\n\n\fquarter of 2021. Employment did so in August of this year, and the unemployment rate has\nbasically come back to its low pre-COVID levels. While there is a lot of talk about a\nrecession, the strength of the labor market suggests that is still premature.\nBut, despite the good news that the worst of the virus seems behind us, we have not yet\nreturned to normal. Supply chains remain strained as �rms struggle to meet ever-shifting\nlevels of demand with unstable production capacity. Employers are short workers, partly\ndue to lower immigration and excess retirements. The war in Ukraine and widespread\ndrought conditions are a�ecting commodity supply.\nAnd, of course, for the �rst time in a generation, we are grappling with high, broad-based\nand persistent in�ation. The Consumer Price Index is at 8.3 percent. The Fed’s preferred\nmetric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, is 6.2 percent headline and 4.9\npercent core. Both are near 40-year highs.\n\nThe resurgence of in�ation is particularly noteworthy. Before the pandemic, we had\ndecades of remarkably low and stable in�ation. I give my Fed predecessors credit for that –\na lot of work went into reducing in�ation and stabilizing in�ation expectations.\nSo, it is worth asking: What happened? How did we end up in an in�ationary environment\nmost wouldn’t have imagined just three years ago? I thought I’d share my views, but I look\nforward to hearing yours as well.\nSupply Shocks\nI start with the main story of the past few years: COVID-19. The pandemic (and the\nresponses to it) unleashed a series of physical and human supply shocks that have pushed\nprices and wages up and lasted far longer than anyone anticipated.\nOn the physical side, lockdowns shifted spending from services to goods, especially those\nrelated to time at home. Then, reopening with a successful vaccine unleashed demand.\nManufacturers were unable to keep up; they struggled to forecast and to operate their\ncomplex supply chains. Transportation networks became overwhelmed. Houses were in\nshort supply. The services sector was plagued with supply shortages too: They couldn’t �nd\nenough chicken wings, popcorn buckets or replacement car parts.\nBoth the goods and services sectors also dealt with labor supply shocks. At �rst, the issue\nwas sick or quarantined workers. But the direct health impact was not the only problem.\nImmigration dropped. Child care and elder care responsibilities ballooned. Retirements\nwere pulled forward. Health fears stuck around. So, even once COVID protocols lifted, many\nbusinesses couldn’t operate at pre-pandemic capacity. Restaurant service is still an issue.\nAnd today, employers are struggling with productivity as they try to train new workers.\nBoth shocks have been surprisingly persistent. I thought as soon as vaccines were available,\nschools reopened and enhanced unemployment ended, people would return to the labor\nmarket. I thought chips would be in cars by now.\n\n\fI should probably also mention non-pandemic supply shocks, as there have been quite a\nfew. There was the severe winter storm in Texas, the �re at a chip plant in Japan, the ship\nlodged in the Suez Canal, the bird �u outbreak and then, in case things were feeling too\ncalm, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In normal times, each might have had only a �eeting\nimpact on in�ation. But during COVID, each piled on more price pressure.\nSo, supply shocks are clearly part of the story. But, as I’ll discuss further in a moment, the\nchallenges went beyond supply. For goods like durables, apparel and pet supplies, demand\nremains much higher than pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, in�ation has broadened\nbeyond supply chain-a�ected sectors; it now seems to be hitting virtually every single one.\nFor most of us, COVID seems e�ectively over and a number of these supply shocks have\npassed. If supply was the issue, why hasn’t in�ation settled by now?\nFiscal Fuel\nThat brings us to �scal policy. Six trillion dollars of stimulus was passed, fueling demand\nand limiting labor supply. Six trillion is a lot of money. It supported programs like stimulus\nchecks and eviction pauses. It supercharged demand, particularly from the segments of our\neconomy with the highest marginal propensity to consume. The PPP helped keep\nbusinesses a�oat, but it also sustained worker demand that might otherwise have dropped.\nAll these programs hit the economy at a time when the supply of labor and goods was\nconstrained.\nSome would additionally argue that ever-expanding �scal de�cits, on the watch of both\npolitical parties, are driving in�ation as well. Signi�cant de�cits run the risk of unanchoring\nin�ation expectations. If people believe government has lost its will to control spending,\nthey could conclude that it has no option but to in�ate its way out of its debt burden.\nSo, current and expected �scal spending is also part of the story. But while overall demand\nhas recovered, it is not elevated in total. Much of the stimulus hasn’t been spent. Americans\nstill have an estimated $1.5 trillion in excess savings, state and local governments still have\nbillions to tap and the infrastructure package will take years to roll out. So, it is hard to pin\nin�ation entirely on stimulus-fueled demand.\nMoreover, in�ation is global today. Other countries that did not pursue the same level of\n�scal response are still dealing with decades-high in�ation. The notable exception is the\nplace with one of the most prominent historic debt burdens: Japan.\nMoney, Money, Money\nWe need then to explore monetary policy and ask whether we would be witnessing this\nin�ation if the Fed had taken a di�erent approach. You won’t be surprised that I’ve spent a\nlot of time considering this question.\nSome point to the dramatic increase in the money supply. Since the start of the pandemic,\nin the context of government de�cits and asset purchases, M2 grew 40 percent. Milton\nFriedman famously said that (in the medium term), “In�ation is always and everywhere a\n\n\fmonetary phenomenon.” What other proof could we need?\nPaul Volcker started targeting the money supply in late 1979 but shifted to targeting\ninterest rates as a better policy just three years later. Financial innovation, among other\nforces, has made money velocity less stable and weakened the relationship between\nmoney supply, GDP growth and in�ation. We can see the velocity issue during COVID: M2\nvelocity fell approximately 25 percent in 2020 — not my de�nition of stability.\nIn the last recovery, when M2 increased nearly 46 percent between 2010 and 2015, we saw\n�ve-year in�ation fall from 2.2 percent to 1.4 percent. If money supply were the driving\nforce today, we would need to understand why it wasn’t back then.\nOthers argue the Fed was too expansionary for too long — that we were caught o� guard\nafter the prior decade of stubbornly low in�ation.\nWe believed in�ation was temporary, driven by the supply and demand factors discussed\nearlier. History taught us not to overreact to short-lived supply shocks — it usually doesn’t\nmake sense to constrain the economy to �ght a shock that will go away on its own. But\nin�ation didn’t fade as we had expected.\nTo be sure, we have learned something for future supply shocks. With perfect hindsight, it\nwould have made sense to have ended asset purchases and raised rates earlier. But sick\nworkers would still have had to stay home. Car manufacturers would still have been short\nchips. Russian oil and Ukrainian wheat supplies would still have been disrupted.\nIn theory, if monetary policy had been di�erent enough, perhaps it could have made a\ndi�erence. But how much faster would we have had to move to be in a demonstrably\ndi�erent place? Remember that in February 2021, 12-month in�ation was still at 1.7\npercent (PCE), nearly 8.8 million fewer people were employed than in February 2020 and\nunemployment was at 6.2 percent.\nHere, I think it is worth emphasizing another Friedman insight: Monetary policy works with\n“long and variable lags.” Our impact is more on the medium to long term than on the short\nterm. So, I take some solace from the fact that medium- and long-term in�ation\nexpectations remain relatively stable as we have now fully engaged in tightening.\nSo, those who are exhausted by in�ation can point �ngers in lots of directions. It’s part\nCOVID and supply imbalances. It’s part �scal. And it’s part monetary. Movements in any of\nthese factors could have quieted in�ation somewhat. But I’m not convinced any one of\nthem is the whole story. For me, it’s the accumulation of so many in�ationary pressures at\nonce that likely tells the tale. In football terms, we �ooded the zone.\n\nBefore I joined the Fed, I spent 30 years in business. At the Fed, I try to spend my time “on\nthe ground,” understanding how businesses and individuals experience the economy. So, I\nlook at all of this with a real economy lens.\n\n\fOver the past 40 years, in�ation stayed so low and so stable that price and wage increases\nbecame an all-but-abandoned lever. Price-setters lost con�dence they could pass costs on\nto customers; they focused on reducing their own costs instead. Firms employed\nsophisticated purchasing professionals to �ght suppliers hard on cost increases. Workers\ngrew to expect annual increases in a low and narrow range. In that era of price and wage\nstability, consumers, quite rationally, were inattentive to in�ation.\nNow we have seen these intense in�ation pressures accumulate and persist. Perhaps\nmagni�ed in an environment where news travels ever faster, they have moved short-term\nexpectations higher. Massive industry-wide cost pressures pushed suppliers to take the risk\nof passing cost increases on to customers. Supply shortages gave them con�dence they\ncould weather potential customer attrition. Purchasers, focused on resiliency rather than\ne�ciency, stopped objecting as much. Investors rewarded companies that passed price\nincreases on and penalized those more reticent. Consumers, funded by stimulus, mostly\naccepted price increases. Workers gained con�dence in this very tight labor market and\nnegotiated for �exibility or wage increases. Employers desperately adjusted to do what it\ntook to retain and recruit.\nIn short, businesses constrained by a generation of limited pricing power seized the\nopportunity that arose. Workers emboldened by unprecedented labor market tightness did\nthe same. We all started paying attention.\nThe question is how long this can last. Persistence is the essence of in�ation. When I talk to\nbusiness leaders, they still view their increased pricing power as temporary. They see it as\nan episode, not a regime change. To support that, with stimulus being drawn down, you\nhear more and more stories of consumers trading down or doing without. With recession\ntalk widespread, you hear of labor pressures easing (e.g., recent announcements on return\nto o�ce). Long-term market measures of in�ation compensation, derived from TIPS\nindices, remain in line with our 2 percent target despite short-term in�ation and in�ation\nexpectations at multidecade highs. The water in the river may be high, but it hasn’t yet\nbreached the dam the Fed built to keep in�ation expectations in line with our 2 percent\ntarget.\n\nWhat does this all mean for where in�ation is headed? First, note that no matter what\ntheory you have on in�ation, you are seeing promising signs.\nCOVID seems to be moving into the rearview mirror. Supply shocks are easing. An index\nmeasuring supply chain pressure from the New York Fed has fallen to its lowest level since\nJanuary 2021. Freight costs have decreased. Some large retailers have announced they are\noverstocked. Housing seems to be settling. Employers are having more hiring success;\nmore than 3.5 million jobs have been created since the start of the year. And over the last\nfew months, we’ve seen a broad range of commodities drop from peak pricing levels.\nInternational developments could further weaken commodity demand.\n\n\fFiscal stimulus has waned. The projected de�cit is expected to fall from 12.4 percent of GDP\nin 2021 to 3.9 percent this year (and 3.7 percent next year), according to the Congressional\nBudget O�ce. And we are seeing the extra savings amassed by consumers being spent\ndown. The personal saving rate has remained below pre-pandemic levels for over six\nmonths.\nFor those who still monitor the money supply, it has stayed nearly �at this year, increasing\njust over 1 percent.\nAnd the Fed is moving expeditiously. You’ve likely seen that we have raised rates 300 basis\npoints, started shrinking our balance sheet aggressively and signaled there are more rate\nincreases to come. The transmission of these changes, especially in interest-sensitive\nsectors, has been rapid. Look at mortgage rates, which in mid-September had more than\ndoubled from a year prior.\nSo, in�ation should come down. But I don’t expect its drop to be immediate nor\npredictable. We’ve been through multiple shocks, as I’ve discussed, and signi�cant shocks\nsimply take time to dampen. On the business side, I still hear �rms facing wage pressure,\nespecially for merit pay in the face of this year’s cost-of-living pressures. And while margins\nremain healthy overall, I've heard from many businesses still working to recover costs not\nyet passed through. On the consumer side, while lower-income consumers are facing\nstress, higher-income ones seem to be continuing revenge spending.\nOur rate and balance sheet moves take time to bring in�ation down. But the Fed will persist\nuntil they do. One of the key lessons from the ‘70s was not to declare victory prematurely.\nPerhaps we will get help from supply chain and energy market normalization. But we have\nthe tools to bring in�ation down, even if those disruptions continue. As we do, we should\nlearn even more about the drivers of this episode and how we can avoid any recurrence.\nBianchi, Francesco, and Leonardo Melosi. \"In�ation as a Fiscal Limit.\" Federal Reserve Bank\nof Chicago Working Paper No. 2022-37, August 2022.\nWhile in�ation in Japan has recently reached new highs, it is still relatively low compared to\nglobal levels.\nThis refers to the percentage change in the consumption velocity of M2 from February 2020\nto April 2020.\n\n\fIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nIt's that time of year again. I don't mean the sudden crispness in the air nor the return of\nfootball season. It's back-to-school time, and once again we are talking about challenges in\nK-12 sta�ng.\nThis scramble for teachers and sta� coincides with the recent news that the overall U.S.\neconomy has recovered 100 percent of the jobs lost during the pandemic. It's a reminder\nthat the jobs recovery has been unequal across sectors, leaving segments of our economy\nbehind.\nThe economy is not just missing K-12 sta�. It is short nurses, child care workers and elder\ncare providers, too — all jobs that are essential in supporting the development and\nparticipation of workers in our economy.\nTaking a historic lens, these occupations were some of the pathways most readily available\nto women before they began entering the workforce in larger numbers. Take nursing, for\nexample. In 1950, almost 100 percent of nurses were women. In public education, over 60\npercent of the 1950 workforce was female. Today, these remain majority woman careers.\nAlmost 90 percent of nurses are still women, and local public education is over 70 percent\nwomen. Child care and elder care sta�ng is over 80 percent women. Some have observed\nthat the history of the labor supply for these critical jobs has left their compensation\nmisaligned with the societal value they create.\nWhy are these jobs lagging the overall economic recovery today? Blame the pandemic for\nexacerbating existing challenges and introducing new ones:\nEven prior to the pandemic, these roles were demanding.\nCaregivers and educators are constantly on their feet. They have to be agile, patient and\nempathetic as they deal with unique needs from individuals who often don't want to be\nthere in the �rst place. They endure a high-stakes environment, with lives, well-beings and\nfutures on the line.\n\n\fThe pandemic turned the heat up further. Workers had to implement and enforce everevolving safety regulations. And they did so while putting their own health at risk, while\nothers worked from home. The stress continued once lockdowns lifted, as those they cared\nfor su�ered their own health issues, children returned with learning loss and behavioral\nissues, and families expressed varying views of appropriate protocols.\nAnd, of course, increased turnover and hiring challenges meant all the burden — old and\nnew — strained those who remained.\nAt the start of the pandemic, average hourly earnings\nfor workers at child care facilities were just $16.27. At nursing and residential care facilities,\nthat number was $19.39. Compare those to the economy's overall average earnings of\n$28.56.\nDuring the pandemic, wages went up across the board — including for these roles. But\ncompetition has remained �erce. Take child care. Wages improved in that sector — up\nalmost $3 to $19.09 — but not as much as wages increased elsewhere. A child care worker\ncould leave the sector for warehousing and storage and see average hourly earnings\nincrease another $3. So, this harder work got relatively less well paid.\nEven in jobs with higher relative wages, pandemic disruptions shaped new incentives. We\n�rst saw an increase in traveling nurses as COVID-19 hit di�erent areas of the country on a\nrolling timeline. But the increased use and compensation of travel nurses has incentivized\nmore to look at traveling as a higher wage alternative to the traditional career path.\nPrior to 2020, many of these jobs could have been thought of as\nmore secure than other occupations. They are the original essential workers. But in 2020,\nwhen nonurgent care was postponed, hospitals furloughed sta�. When lockdowns were\nput in place, day care centers shut down. Schools remained virtually open but suddenly\nrequired a whole new set of skills.\nAt the same time, other jobs became more attractive. They grew. Their compensation\nincreased. Work from home opportunities blossomed. Workers took note. The traditionally\nlow quits rate for health care and social assistance and for state and local education hit\nseries highs in 2021 and 2022.\n\nSome of these positions can't reprice easily. Local governments face constrained budgets\nand often need support from multiple stakeholders to adjust K-12 pay. The child care\nsector su�ers from razor-thin margins. Health care and elder care capacity depend on\nfunding decisions from Medicare and Medicaid.\nAdditionally, in�exibility is built into these roles. Most of these positions are in person and\nwork set hours. With the tight labor market o�ering an increase in hybrid jobs, it may be\nhard for employers to overcome the allure of less commuting and fewer challenging\ninterpersonal interactions.\n\n\fAcross these occupations, employers often need certi�ed and trained workers, and the\npipeline is not always wide enough to accommodate their needs. For example, there are\nlimits on how many nurses can be trained at a time, and their training takes exactly that —\ntime.\nThese obstacles aren't keeping communities and employers from trying. Some states are\nintroducing legislation to raise the minimum salary for teachers or child care workers.\nSome school districts are o�ering a�ordable housing options for educators and sta�. And\nhospitals and elder care facilities are exploring new incentives like signing bonuses, �exible\nscheduling and tuition reimbursement.\nWhether it's due to the demanding nature of these jobs, their in�exible wages or the notion\nthat the grass may be greener in other sectors, it's clear that there are real obstacles to the\nrecovery of these critical occupations. Perhaps the normalization of the economy will lessen\nemployers' stress by reducing the attractiveness of alternative careers. But we will have to\ndo some learning of our own this back-to-school season. Will supply and demand naturally\ncome back into balance? Will employer creativity on the work environment and bene�ts\nmake these �elds more attractive? Or will more funding — be it from governments,\nconsumers or others — be made available to reprice these jobs? Given the importance of\nthese jobs to the economy today and tomorrow, we need a path forward.\nData on nurses is drawn from the 1950 U.S. Census occupation data and the 2019 American\nCommunity Survey (ACS) 1-Year data. Public school data is drawn from the 1950 U.S. Census\nindustry data and 2019 Current Employment Statistics data. Child care and elder care data is\ndrawn from the 1950 U.S. Census industry data and 2020 ACS 5-Year data.\nThe nursing and residential care facilities sector includes but is not limited to nursing care\nfacilities and community care facilities for the elderly.

COVID\ndisrupted that stability. And similar to a post-war period, we are seeing the economy\nnow struggle to return to normal.\n• At �rst, in�ationary pressures seemed temporary. But in�ation has persisted, risen\nand become broader based. It’s the Fed’s responsibility to act to reduce in�ation and\nstabilize expectations, and we are.\n• The Fed’s tools work over time, so I expect in�ation to come down, but not\nimmediately, not suddenly, and not predictably. I see in�ation coming down in three\nlanes: demand should �atten, supply chains should heal and commodities should\nsettle. The pace of normalization is uncertain, which is understandably unsettling\nand leads to worries about a recession.\n• We are out of balance today because stimulus-supported excess demand\noverwhelmed constrained supply. Returning to normal does not require a calamitous\ndecline in activity.\n• Moderating demand has a higher purpose squarely in our mandate: containing\nin�ation. We have been reminded this year: in�ation is painful and people hate it.\n\nThanks for that nice introduction. It’s great to be back and to have the opportunity to trade\nviews on what’s happening in the economy. I’ll start with my thoughts, but caution they are\nmine alone and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. And I\nlook forward to your questions at the end.\n\n\fI should start with some context. The pre-pandemic decade was an unusually stable one in\neconomic terms. GDP grew consistently between 1.5 and 3 percent a year. We added jobs\nin every month after 2010. Core in�ation stayed in the narrow range of 1 to 2 percent.\nCOVID-19 of course has changed all that. I like analogies, and one relevant to today’s\nsituation is the aftermath of war. War upends economies: The government invests\nmassively; labor leaves the workplace, sadly some permanently; manufacturing plants are\nrecon�gured to produce weapons; consumers shift their spending to support the e�ort.\nAnd when a war ends, economies struggle to return to normal. There’s often a �scal\nhangover. Soldiers need retraining. Plants need to restart, with supply chains fragile. And,\namid all this adjustment, euphoric consumers spend freely.\nAs a result, at the end of a war, in�ation typically spikes. After both world wars, in�ation\nrose above 20 percent. And most of us remember well the postwar Vietnam ’70s\n(recognizing there were multiple sources of that in�ation).\nWith apologies to those who’ve experienced the horror of an actual war, look at the\naftermath of the “war on COVID.” Six trillion dollars of �scal stimulus has hit the economy.\nWorkers have stayed home, with participation still well below pre-pandemic levels. Many\nhave died. Businesses have struggled with meeting demand as supply chains proved\nvulnerable to the virus and consumer spending shifted in a locked down world. Postvaccine, euphoric consumers have been revenge spending. All of that has been\nexacerbated by an actual war – in Ukraine – that has driven up commodity prices. As a\nresult, we are again faced with postwar-like in�ation. The CPI is at a 40-year high of 9.1\npercent. The Fed’s preferred metric, PCE, is 6.8 percent headline, and 4.8 percent core.\nAt �rst, these in�ationary pressures seemed temporary, driven by pandemic reopening or\nsupply chain challenges like semiconductor chips. But in�ation has persisted, risen and\nbecome ever broader based. So the Fed’s responsibility is to act to reduce in�ation and\nstabilize expectations, and we are. You’ve likely seen that over our last four meetings we\nhave raised rates 225 basis points, started shrinking our balance sheet and signaled there\nare more rate increases to come. We are committed to returning in�ation to our 2 percent\ntarget and have made clear we will do what it takes.\nThe Fed’s tools work over time. So I expect in�ation to come down but not immediately, not\nsuddenly and not predictably. Some sectors are in oversupply; others still have cost\nincreases they are passing on. After a decade of stability has been replaced by extreme\nvolatility, I’d expect in�ation to bounce around on its way back to our target. These\nsigni�cant shock waves will take time to dampen.\nI see in�ation coming down in three lanes.\nFirst, demand should �atten, reducing pricing pressure. Fiscal stimulus has waned, and\nexcess savings are being spent down. The Fed has a lot of in�uence here. Higher rates\nshould slow the economy by increasing borrowing costs and disincentivizing spending and\ninvestment. We are starting to see some precautionary softening in business investment\n\n\fand slowing in interest-sensitive sectors like housing. Real consumer spending grew only\n0.1 percent in June.\nSecond, pandemic supply chain challenges should heal as pandemic pressures ease and\ncompanies adjust. Manufacturers will get chips into cars at some point and – when they do\n– those prices should start to normalize. On the margin, weakening demand could help by\ngiving businesses space to catch up on hiring and inventories. We’ve seen some early\nsignals of this healing, with freight costs decelerating, large retailers announcing that they\nare now more than fully stocked and employers having more hiring success, but it will still\ntake time for these pressures to fully abate.\nAnd �nally, there’s the commodities lane, items like oil and wheat. Global events are driving\nthis part of in�ation, and the Fed has little in�uence here. But we are seeing over the last\ntwo months, the dollar strengthening and gasoline and even the broader range of\ncommodities dropping from peak pricing levels. Hopefully commodities will continue to\nnormalize and not be victim to further events (like a natural gas shut-o� in Europe).\nThese three lanes are hard to forecast, so the pace of normalization is uncertain. As a\nresult, our commitment to bring in�ation to target, which hopefully you welcome, leads to\nworries about a recession. That’s especially true now that we have seen two consecutive\nquarters with negative (albeit noisy) estimates of GDP growth. Recession fears are a little\ninconsistent with an economy adding almost 400,000 jobs a month and with\nunemployment near its historic low at 3.6 percent. But I understand the concerns.\nFirst, in�ation has made consumer and business sentiment quite negative. In the most\nrecent Michigan Survey, consumer sentiment was near its record low. The percentage of\nsmall business owners who expect better conditions over the next six months dropped to\nthe lowest level in that survey’s history in June. Typically, sentiment this low is associated\nwith a weakening like the one we are seeing in consumer spending and business\ninvestment. Some call that “talking ourselves into a recession.”\nAt the same time – as I mentioned – in�ation is moving the Fed to increase rates.\nHistorically, eight of the last 11 Fed tightening cycles have been followed by some sort of a\nrecession.\nThat change in policy may well be making markets skittish. That’s understandable: The Fed\nhasn’t moved this quickly in over 20 years. Markets had a rough �rst half of the year, and\nmarket trauma sometimes can cause investors and businesses to pull back.\nThose who look more closely for signals point to �ashing lights coming from the 2-10 yield\ncurve, a closely watched recession predictor that has now inverted. When short-term\ninterest rates are higher than long-term ones, markets see risk on the horizon. The 2-10\nyield curve has predicted eight of the last seven recessions.\nAnother frequently cited signal has been the dramatic recent increase in oil prices, which\nhas occurred in advance of most of our past recessions.\n\n\fThere’s also a fear about what else may come our way. We’ve already seen multiple supply\nside challenges, including pandemic-era shortages, the war in Ukraine and the lockdowns in\nChina. Each has fanned the �ames of in�ation and raised questions about future demand.\nWho knows what is coming next?\nSo there is a path to getting in�ation under control. But a recession could happen in the\nprocess. If one does, we need to keep it in perspective: No one canceled the business cycle.\nWe are out of balance today because stimulus-supported excess demand overwhelmed\nsupply constrained by the pandemic and global commodity shocks. Returning to normal\nmeans products on shelves, restaurants fully sta�ed and cars at auto dealers. It doesn’t\nhave to require a calamitous decline in activity. Indeed, lower prices may create room for\nconsumers to spend again. As for �nancial markets, they are not the economy. And\nbaselines matter. Equities are down this year but still signi�cantly up from pre-pandemic\nlevels. We might soon have the same conversation about houses were prices to slip after\ntwo years of extraordinary gains.\nMost importantly, moderating demand has a higher purpose squarely in our mandate:\ncontaining in�ation. If there is any lesson that’s been relearned in the last year, it is that\nin�ation is painful, and everyone hates it.\nWhy do we hate in�ation so much? In�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it\nbecomes unclear when to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It\ntakes work to shop around for better prices and for �rms to handle complaints from\nunhappy customers and negotiate with insistent suppliers. And in�ation seems unfair. In\nthe ’70s, those who owned a house with a cheap mortgage bene�ted; those on �xed\nincomes did not. Workers who feel they have earned wage gains feel arbitrarily pinched at\nthe gas pump. Homeowners like their sale price but can’t believe their purchase price.\nBusinesses work to capture value through pricing but feel they’re being taken advantage of\nby suppliers.\nStabilizing expectations by getting in�ation to target creates the certainty that enables\ngrowth and supports maximum employment. In�ation got under control after World War I,\nsetting up the Roaring ‘20s. It got under control after World War II, setting up the prosperity\nof the ‘50s and ‘60s. It lingered for far too long after the Vietnam War – a period we don’t\nwant to repeat. So the Fed is committed to getting in�ation under control. We may or may\nnot get help from global events and supply chains, but we have the tools, and we have the\ncredibility with households, businesses and markets required to deliver that outcome over\ntime and we will.\nAnd with that, I’d welcome your questions and insights.\n\n\fIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

There is of course recession risk along the way,\nbut there’s also the prospect of the economy returning closer to normal.\n\nI like giving speeches. The economy matters to everyone. When I speak, I get to share what\nthe Fed is learning and doing, in what I hope is plain English. But my favorite part of every\nspeech is when it ends. Of course, I hope that won’t be your favorite part today.\nI like ending a speech because that’s when I get to hear from you. Through your comments\nand questions, I learn how you’re experiencing the economy and what’s top of mind. Before\nthe pandemic, the most popular question was when our lengthy expansion would end.\nThen, of course it was the impact of COVID-19. Once stimulus passed, it became the de�cit.\nLast year, audiences moved on to the de�nition of “transitory” and the value of\ncryptocurrencies. And so far this year, it’s been all about rate increases.\nSo, what am I hearing today? Two questions. The �rst would have been hard to imagine just\n\n\ftwo years ago: “Will in�ation go back down to normal levels?” Remember it had lagged our\ntwo percent target ever since the Great Recession. The second goes full circle, asking again,\n“Are we headed into a recession?”\nToday, I want to try to tackle those questions. I caution that these are my thoughts and not\nthose of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. I also feel obliged to repeat the joke\nthat economic forecasters were created to make weather forecasters look good. After all,\nwhen I answered recession questions three years ago, I certainly didn’t talk about a\npandemic shock.\nSo, �rst: “Will in�ation return to normal?” That answer is simple: yes. In�ation is too high.\nBut the Fed has the tools to contain in�ation over the medium-term, and we are committed\nto returning in�ation to our target. You’ve likely seen that over our last three meetings we\nhave raised rates 150 basis points, started shrinking our balance sheet and signaled there\nare more rate increases to come. We are meeting the test we face and have made clear we\nwill do what it takes.\nBut that commitment, which hopefully you welcome, directly leads to the second question:\n“Are we headed into a recession?” I would caution that no one canceled the business cycle,\nso one can never fully rule out a recession — it’s just a question of timing. But I get why the\nconcern might be elevated today.\nFirst, consumer and business sentiment are quite negative. In the most recent Michigan\nSurvey, consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level on record. In addition, the percentage of\nsmall business owners who expect better conditions over the next six months dropped to\nthe lowest level in that survey’s history in May. Both surveys show in�ation driving this\npessimism. Typically, sentiment this low is associated with a weakening in consumer\nspending and business investment.\nAt the same time, �scal support from the pandemic is waning, and — as I mentioned —\nin�ation is moving the Fed to increase rates. Higher rates tend to slow the economy by\nincreasing borrowing costs and disincentivizing spending and investment. Historically, eight\nof the last 11 Fed tightening cycles have been followed by some sort of a recession.\nThat change in policy may well be making markets skittish. That’s understandable: The Fed\nhasn’t moved this quickly in over 20 years. And forecasters are predicting that our current\nrate increase cycle will go higher than its predecessor’s relatively low 2.4 percent 2019 peak.\nNow, the stock market is not the economy. But if markets were to crater, that could slow\nthe economy by leading individuals and �rms to pull back their spending and investment.\nThose who look more closely for signals may be pointing to �ashing lights coming from the\n2-10 yield curve, a closely watched recession predictor that inverted brie�y in March and\nagain in mid-June. When short-term interest rates are higher than long-term ones, markets\nsee risk on the horizon. The 2-10 yield curve has predicted eight of the last seven\nrecessions. I should note that Fed research suggests it’s the short end of the yield curve\nthat is a cleaner signal — and that end remains steep.\n\n\fAnother frequently cited signal has been the dramatic recent increase in oil prices, which\nhas occurred in advance of most of our past recessions.\nThere’s also a fear about what else may come our way. We’ve already seen multiple supply\nside challenges, including pandemic-era shortages, the war in Ukraine and the lockdowns in\nChina. Each has fanned the �ames of in�ation and raised questions about future demand.\nWho knows what is to come next?\nSo, I understand why some are forecasting a recession. And risk managers like you need to\nconsider this risk in your scenario planning. But the challenge in predicting a recession for\ntomorrow is the strength of the aggregate data today.\nConsumer spending is about two-thirds of the economy, and it remains quite healthy,\nsupported by strong personal balance sheets, excess savings accrued during the pandemic\nand freedom from COVID-19 restrictions. Just try to book a trip this summer. We are seeing\nspending pivot from goods to services (a�ecting some retailers), and early signs of stress\nfor those with lower incomes — but not enough to a�ect the overall numbers. The negative\n�rst quarter GDP was driven by one-time reversals in inventories and net exports and\nshould rebound this quarter. The unemployment rate is historically low at 3.6 percent, and\nthere are still 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person. While rates are rising\nexpeditiously, they have not yet reached the level which constrains the economy. I have\nnoted pullbacks in auto and home sales, but — with prices still rising — attribute both\nmostly to continuing supply shortages.\nAnd household and bank balance sheets look healthy. Households and �nancial institutions\ndeleveraged after the Great Recession. By the start of the pandemic, households had\nreturned to debt levels last seen in 2001, and many used stimulus funds to pay debt down\neven further. You can see the di�erent dynamics in play by looking at the housing market. If\nthe phrase of the day before the Great Recession was “subprime mortgages,” today it’s\n“cash o�er.” We are in a very di�erent place.\nSo, data on today’s economy still looks relatively healthy. Tomorrow is of course unclear.\nOur path forward depends on three signi�cant uncertainties. First, how long will it take the\npandemic’s impact on spending, labor supply and supply chains to normalize? Second, how\nhigh does the Fed need to raise rates to calm demand, bring in�ation down and keep\nin�ation expectations anchored? And third, what other outside forces will push demand\nand/or in�ation up or down?\nBarring an unanticipated event, I see rising rates stabilizing any drift in in�ation\nexpectations and in so doing, increasing real interest rates and quieting demand.\nCompanies will slow down their hiring. Revenge spending will settle. Savings will be held a\nlittle tighter. At the same time, supply chains will ease; you have to believe chips will get\nback into cars at some point. That means in�ation should come down over time — but it\nwill take time.\nThis moderation of demand could happen without crossing the line into the technical\n\n\fde�nition of a recession. But my dad was a depression child, and he taught me not to\nexpect the best case and run the risk of being disappointed. Instead, I always have my mind\naround the downside, and welcome it if I’m positively surprised. Perhaps many of you in\nrisk management think the same way. A recession downside would of course be unwanted,\nbut not all recessions are equal. We’ve been scarred by our memories of the Great\nRecession and the Volcker recession, but it’s worth remembering that most other\nrecessions aren’t that long or that deep.\nAnd a slowdown from our current situation must be kept in perspective: We are out of\nbalance today because stimulus-supported excess demand overwhelmed supply\nconstrained by the pandemic and global commodity shocks. Returning to normal means\nproducts on shelves, restaurants fully sta�ed and cars at auto dealers. It doesn’t have to\nrequire a calamitous decline in activity. As for �nancial markets, they are hardly the whole\neconomy, but even they could bene�t from rea�rmation that trees don’t grow to the sky\nand a reminder that valuations are always worth a fresh look.\nMost importantly, moderating demand has a higher purpose squarely in our mandate:\ncontaining in�ation. If there is any lesson that’s been relearned in the last year, it is that\neveryone hates in�ation. Workers who feel they have earned wage gains feel arbitrarily\npinched at the gas pump. Homeowners like their sale price but can’t believe their purchase\nprice. Businesses work to capture value through pricing but feel they’re being taken\nadvantage of by suppliers.\nWhy do they hate in�ation? In�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it\nbecomes unclear when to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It\ntakes work to shop around for better prices and for �rms to handle complaints from\nunhappy customers and negotiate with insistent suppliers. And in�ation seems unfair. In\nthe ‘70s, those who owned a house with a cheap mortgage bene�ted; those on �xed\nincomes did not.\nThe Fed is on a path to return in�ation back to normal levels. We have the credibility with\nhouseholds, businesses and markets required to deliver that outcome. We may or may not\nget help from global events and supply chains. There is of course recession risk along the\nway, but there’s also the prospect of the economy returning closer to normal.\nAnd now for the part I like the best. I’d like to hear your sentiment on the economy. I’m\ninterested in how businesses might be changing their hiring, investment and pricing plans.\nI’m curious how supply chains, labor markets and spending patterns are evolving. We at the\nFed have a commitment to open communication, but it’s not a one-way street. What I learn\nfrom you is as important as what I get to share. And I welcome your questions (and\nperhaps advice for my next speech).\n“Alan Blinder on Landings Hard and Soft: The Fed, 1965-2020.” Princeton University\nBendheim Center for Finance.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nBefore the pandemic, the o�ce was a core feature of modern life. It was prominent in the\nskyscraper architecture of downtowns, and in the professional attire sections of\ndepartment stores. And it dominated popular culture, not only in the namesake TV show\n\"The O�ce,\" but in the countless shows and movies centered around the workplace, from\n\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" to \"The Devil Wears Prada.\"\nWe have now had a two-year experiment with a di�erent, home-based model. As we\nemerge from the pandemic era, some are abandoning o�ces altogether. Others are trying\nto make a full return to pre-pandemic normal. Many of us are in the middle, trying to de�ne\nand operate a new hybrid model that embraces the �exibility of remote work while\nreintroducing the features we missed from in-person work.\nIt will take time for the markets to decide on the winning stance for each sector. But now\nthat the pandemic has shown we can operate remotely, I've little doubt we will see\nemployers o�er increased �exibility. Employees value it, and recruiters are �nding it an\nimportant lever (several examples were in the most recent Beige Book). It is pairing workers\nand companies that otherwise wouldn't have considered each other (whether due to\ngeography, family duties or health). Increased �exibility could allow for better matches and\nimproved lifestyles. It could pull more workers into the workforce and help businesses\nincrease productivity through improved hiring pools and reduced real estate needs.\nBut �exibility won't be costless. O�ces evolved into the dominant model for good reasons,\nand companies are rightfully hesitant to lose those bene�ts. Originally, the bene�t was\ne�ciency and productivity — centralization of operations and administrative work. But,\nover time, it became clear that o�ces provide much more.\nO�ces help spark ideas. We often hear economists talk about agglomeration economies —\nthe bene�ts from clustering companies and workers together — in relation to cities. We see\nthose same e�ects in the o�ce context. Proximity facilitates the exchange of ideas among\nworkers, which fosters collaboration, innovation and productivity.\n\n\fThat innovation is a product of the interaction we see in o�ces. Unplanned lunches in the\ncafeteria and quick walks to get co�ee can build organically over time into friendships and\nsometimes, even deeper relationships. Small talk at the beginning of meetings or water\ncooler conversations can evolve into mentor relationships. Relationships build loyalty\namong employees, and in turn, to the institution itself.\nThose interactions provide information to management and sta�. After two years of online\nmeetings, it may be hard to remember just how much insight we gain from nonverbal cues.\nO�ces help managers and co-workers observe behaviors otherwise hard to track, such as\nvalues, development needs, level of e�ort or emotional well-being. They also help\nemployees with the unspoken rules of the workplace. It's much easier to know how open\nyour co-workers are to questions and feedback if you see whether their o�ce doors are\nliterally open to you. O�ces also expose employees to parts of the organization beyond\ntheir own teams, providing visibility into potential career options.\nAll these combine with the physical space to create the organization's identity. The o�ce\nenvironment can help employees feel connected. The space — and how people move in it\n— re�ects the company. Is the space set up for individual or group work? Does leadership\njoin for lunch? Is it laid-back or fairly formal? Beyond establishing the vibe, as my kids might\nsay, the o�ce is a visible reminder that employees are part of something larger, fostering\ncommitment. Note the investments made in Silicon Valley to design iconic workspaces.\nThese bene�ts seem intangible, but their loss could impact business outcomes. Fewer\nserendipitous encounters could reduce innovation. Lower exposure to best practices could\nlessen productivity. Less identi�cation with the institution (as well as less fear of showing\nup to work with suspiciously formal attire) could lead to increased turnover. Poorer\nrelationships could hamper career development.\nWe should expect innovative companies to develop ways to reduce these potential losses.\nThey will be intentional about both the tools and practices that enhance their time apart,\nand the time they spend together.\nMost of the attention right now seems to be on the \"new\" part of hybrid — how can we\nbest manage technology and the days out of the o�ce? Zoom was a revelation two years\nago. But now, in the hybrid era, we are seeing investments in full immersion team rooms,\nand best practice hybrid meeting protocols in an e�ort to make in-person and remote\nexperiences more comparable. In time, we may even see organizations �nd a method for\nonline team building that's a little less painful than virtual happy hours. To me,\ntechnological enablement of personal connectivity is the hardest solution to picture, but I'm\nmindful not to prejudge: After all, my kids are much more connected to their high school\nfriends via social media than my friends and I managed to be with letters and calls.\nCompanies also need to intentionally reinvent the o�ce environment. The in-person\nroutine in a successful hybrid stance is unlikely to look the same as what works for a full inperson stance.\n\n\fDuring my time as a consultant in the mid-80s, I saw what a di�erence a small amount of\nintentionality can make. Our work model was 100 percent at our clients. We built great\nteam and client relationships but not enough of a relationship with our �rm. Individuals'\nlink to the �rm was easily severed when a tempting o�er came along. Attrition was skyhigh. In response, we started to require consultants to come to the o�ce on Fridays.\nImportantly, we invested in programming to maximize the value of that time. We saw\nconnections strengthen and engagement levels soar. Attrition fell.\nThe truth is that the mentorship, relationship and engagement aspects of the o�ce\nenvironment have largely been incidental o�shoots of time together. With less time in the\no�ce overall, and less overlap of those days, companies will need to become more\nintentional. This will require conscious programming, as the Richmond Fed's research\ndepartment has launched with its \"Core Week\" concept which groups a series of\nconferences, seminars and research collaborations to create meaningful connections.\nMany organizations are similarly experimenting with more formal mentorship and\nsponsorship programs.\nEnabling more connectivity may require rethinking spending. Some companies are\nreconsidering their physical footprint and lowering real estate costs as a consequence.\nThey should be thinking about redeploying some of those savings into connectivity spend,\nincluding meals and social events in the o�ce, and occasions to bring people together\noutside the workplace. In a world of less day-to-day personal contact, these investments\ncan enhance mutual trust and relationships.\nThere's a lot which we will miss about the old o�ce, just like we miss its TV namesake. But\n�exibility is here to stay. And if we are honest with ourselves, we know we aren't optimizing\nthe hybrid environment today. To make it meet its full potential, we need to leverage the\npower of technology while innovating to recreate the bene�ts which the o�ce once\nprovided.\nThat will require real intentionality.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nProduction and Investment\n\n\fReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

But no one is forgetting\nin�ation today. At �rst, in�ationary pressures seemed temporary, driven by\npandemic reopening or supply chain challenges like chips in cars. But the in�ationary\nnews just keeps coming.\n• All of this has depressed consumer sentiment, and business sentiment has fallen\ntoo. So, we need to get in�ation under control.\n• I see in�ation coming down on two paths. A number of these pandemic-era\npressures will eventually settle. At the same time, interest rates will impact demand\nand expectations. And, as we act, we send messages to consumers and �rms that\nwill manage their expectations for future in�ation. All this will take a little time, but\nmake no mistake, we are on the case.\n\nIt’s great to be with you in person today — and thank you to Debbie and Sharon for inviting\nme and that nice introduction. I want to spend today talking about in�ation. These are my\nviews alone and not those of any of my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nI grew up in the ‘60s and ‘70s — an era when in�ation emerged and then became\nomnipresent and painful. A wage and price freeze left supermarket shelves bare. Twin oil\ncrises led to panic at the pump. President Ford issued Whip In�ation Now buttons. You\ncouldn’t go anywhere without hearing the Bee Gees — it was a tough time. By the mid-‘70s,\ncore Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) in�ation reached 10.2 percent — nearly\ntwice as high as what it is today.\n\n\fBut in the early ‘80s, the Fed under Paul Volcker actually did whip in�ation. Of course,\nthings got bad before they got better — it was the ultimate hard landing: Unemployment\nreached nearly 11 percent in 1982. The economy fell into not one, but two recessions. But\nsince the mid-‘90s, in�ation has been low and stable. And the Fed learned a hard lesson:\nthe role in�ation targeting plays in delivering anchored in�ation expectations, thereby\ncreating a healthy foundation for the economy.\nI have a theory that memory matters. Recessions happen every 8-10 years because that’s\nhow long it takes for a leadership team to rotate, believe they know better and then repeat\nthe errors of their predecessors. Real estate lenders overreach every 15-20 years (1970s,\n1990s, 2000s) as credit o�cers turn over and memories fade. The Roaring ‘20s, the Go-Go\n‘60s and the internet bubble of the early 2000s perhaps demonstrated that market\nmemories only last 30-40 years. And after 30 years of price stability, maybe the same thing\nhappened with in�ation. Prior to the pandemic, the focus was on how to move in�ation\nup, not down. The Phillips curve came into question. Virtually no professional forecaster\npredicted the high, persistent in�ation we’ve been experiencing.\nWell, no one is forgetting in�ation today. The most recent Consumer Price Index is 8.5\npercent. The headline PCE, our preferred metric, is 6.6 percent. Core PCE is at 5.2 percent.\nDemand is strong and looks to remain robust, fueled by healthy business and personal\nbalance sheets, the need to replenish low inventories and state governments that are �ush\nwith cash. Supply chains have been overwhelmed, and suppliers are struggling to bring\nthem back into balance. Labor markets are also tight: Unemployment has dropped to 3.6\npercent. In addition, the pool of available labor has shrunk: 1.2 million fewer workers are in\nthe workforce, and immigration remains well below its pre-COVID-19 trend. As a result,\nprice pressures are everywhere. In�ation is high, persistent and broad-based.\nAt �rst, in�ationary pressures seemed temporary, driven by pandemic reopening or supply\nchain challenges like chips in cars. But the in�ationary news just keeps coming, whether it is\na severe winter storm in Texas, a �re at a chip plant in Japan, a ship lodged in the Suez\nCanal or a backlog in Long Beach. And, of course, most recently, we’ve seen commodity\nprice shocks coming out of the con�ict in Ukraine and new lockdowns in China. These have\nmade in�ation the headline of the day — as of May 1, the Wall Street Journal has had an\nin�ation story on its front page 25 times this year. And on social media, a widely shared\npost jokes that in 2020 we couldn’t leave the house because of COVID-19; now, we can’t\nleave because of skyrocketing gas prices.\nAll of this has depressed consumer sentiment. In the most recent Michigan Survey, the\noverall index of consumer sentiment (April - 65.2) was at levels last seen in the aftermath of\nthe Great Recession and is below where it was at the height of pandemic lockdowns. That is\nremarkable given the strength of the economy and the job market. But sentiment is being\ndriven heavily by in�ation. Respondents expect the year-ahead in�ation rate to remain high\nat 5.4 percent. The last two months have had the highest expectations since 1981. Thirtyeight percent say they’re in a worse �nancial position than they were a year ago. Buying\n\n\fconditions for purchasing a car, a house or an appliance are at their lowest levels since the\nearly ‘80s.\nBusiness sentiment has fallen too. In the Richmond Fed’s most recent CFO Survey\n(conducted in partnership with Duke and the Atlanta Fed), optimism about the U.S.\neconomy dropped nearly 6 points from the fourth quarter of 2021. CFOs cited cost\npressures and in�ation as their top concerns. When looking at small-business owners,\noptimism is even lower. In March, owners who expect better business conditions over the\nnext six months dropped to the lowest level in the survey’s history. Like the CFOs we\nsurveyed, in�ation was their top business problem.\nWe now remember that people thoroughly dislike in�ation. Workers who feel they have\nearned their wage gains feel arbitrarily pinched at the gas pump. Homeowners like their\nsale price but can’t believe their purchase price. Businesses work to capture value through\npricing but feel they’re being taken advantage of by suppliers. They feel powerless in the\nface of cost increases that tax their revenues, earnings and appreciation they have worked\nto achieve.\nWhy do people hate in�ation? Well, no one likes to deal with change, and we haven’t had to\nthink about in�ation for over a generation. And no one remembers the ‘70s fondly. In�ation\ncreates uncertainty — as prices rise unevenly across sectors and over time, it becomes\nunclear when is the right time to spend versus save and where to invest. In�ation is also\ninherently redistributive — in the ‘70s, those who owned a house with a cheap mortgage\nbene�tted; those on �xed incomes didn’t. Those who had wages indexed to in�ation did\nbetter than those who didn’t. And in�ation adds to your workload. It takes e�ort to shop\naround for better prices. Businesses have to handle complaints from unhappy customers,\nnegotiate with insistent suppliers and address any resulting margin pressure. Finally,\nRobert Shiller taught us that people feel in�ation erodes their standard of living by\ndiminishing their buying power, whether it raises their nominal income or not. Higher\nprices mean you can buy less.\nThe pain of in�ation tends to hit low- and �xed-income populations the most. Low-income\nhouseholds dedicate a higher percentage of their wages to consumption than those with\nhigher incomes. There are estimates that the average U.S. household will have to spend\nover $5,000 more this year compared to last year for the same consumption basket, and\nthat impacts those who have a tighter monthly budget.\nTo be clear, not everyone loses with in�ation. We have sectors where nominal wages are up\nwell in excess of in�ation, like leisure and hospitality. We have a lot of homeowners whose\nhouses are worth much more than they could have imagined. And a number of �rms\nreported record pro�ts last year. But it doesn’t matter — everyone hates in�ation.\nSo, we need to get in�ation under control. Congress has given us this mandate. And it’s\ntime.\nWe can’t do much about short-term price surges. Think of it like the aftermath of a\n\n\fhurricane. Lumber prices increase temporarily as demand spikes for materials to make\nnecessary repairs. Raising rates wouldn’t lower lumber prices when people need to rebuild\ntheir homes. Instead, when supply catches up to demand, these price movements reverse\nthemselves.\nBut in the medium term, our moves matter. So, we have begun a tightening process. We\nraised interest rates 25 basis points in March and then another 50 basis points in May. We\nalso announced our plans to reduce our balance sheet, starting on June 1. During his press\nconference, Chair Powell noted that additional 50 basis point increases could be on the\ntable in coming meetings as we work to normalize rates.\nWe will do what we need to do to contain in�ation. But how exactly will our rate moves do\nthat? I see in�ation coming down on two paths. A number of these pandemic-era pressures\nwill eventually settle. Chips will �nally get into cars, and car prices will come down. Labor\nforce participation will continue to rise as COVID-19 eases. Ports will open up as consumers\nrotate back from goods to services. At the same time, interest rates will impact demand\nand expectations. Borrowing rates have already risen, and that will a�ect investment levels\nand spending on interest-sensitive items like houses and cars. And, as we act, we send\nmessages to consumers and �rms that will manage their expectations for future in�ation.\nAll of this will take a little time, but make no mistake, we are on the case.\nYou might ask if this path requires a Volcker-like recession. Not necessarily. At 83 basis\npoints, we are still far from the level of interest rates that constrains the economy; for my\ncolleagues on the FOMC, this neutral rate is in the range of 2-3 percent. And before the\nGreat Recession, the economy handled rates even higher than that. Once we get in the\nrange of the neutral rate, we can then determine whether in�ation remains at a level that\nrequires us to put the brakes on the economy or not.\nIn�ation is high. It has real costs to both individuals and businesses. By contrast, getting\nin�ation closer to the target rate creates the certainty that enables growth and supports\nmaximum employment.

A number of disin�ationary factors a�ected the real economy\nand the Fed's success depended on us recognizing them, understanding their impact\nand adjusting.\n• The pandemic has been quite a storm; bringing, it seems, one short-term in�ationary\ngust after another. Initially, we thought in�ation would be short-lived. Now, with\nin�ation persisting and broadening, we have moved to start to normalize our\nmonetary policy stance.\n• What direction the winds will be blowing going forward remains an open question.\nThere are reasons to think we may face more headwinds, requiring us to navigate in\nthe context of more medium-term in�ationary pressure. If that's the case, we may\nneed to note the conditions and adjust.\n\nThis speech was delivered remotely.\nThanks for having me today. It’s great to be back in front of this group. Today, I want to take\na step back and look beyond today’s headlines. I caution these views are mine alone and\nnot necessarily those of any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe direction of the wind matters. Jim Croce once famously said you don’t spit into the\nwind. The Irish blessing asks that the wind always be at your back. But maybe Virginia\ncountry singer and sausage entrepreneur Jimmy Dean said it best: We can’t change the\ndirection of the wind, but we can adjust our sails. If you’re a sailor like my daughter or even\n\n\fa golfer like me, that notion is pretty familiar. You adjust your game based on the\nconditions you face.\nI think this analogy extends to the question of how the Fed contains in�ation. The\nconditions matter. We take note, and we adjust our course.\nTo give my Fed predecessors due credit, a lot of work has gone into anchoring in�ation\nexpectations over the last generation. As a result, our economy has seen healthy growth\nand an era of remarkably low and stable in�ation.\nDuring this period, a number of disin�ationary factors a�ected the real economy. This\n“series of fortunate events” (if I can borrow from the children’s books) could be described\nas putting “the wind at our back” when it came to containing in�ation. But our success\ndepended on us recognizing those factors and adjusting. The best known such story is\nprobably in the late ‘90s, when the Fed deferred interest rate increases, recognizing that\ntechnology-enabled productivity would limit in�ationary pressure in that period.\nBut there are several other examples of disin�ationary forces:\nGlobalization, especially the rise of India and China, gave producers access to ever-greater\nproportions of lower-cost labor and consumers ever-increasing access to lower-cost\nproducts.\nTechnology enabled innovation. No one could have predicted the explosive growth of ecommerce, which lowered the barrier to price comparisons and cut costs for retailers. Or\nhow fracking provided additional supplies of natural gas and then oil once thought to be\ndepleting.\nThe “e�ective” labor force grew strongly, both in numbers (the baby-boom generation, high\nlevels of immigration and o�shore labor pools as mentioned earlier) and in participation\n(women in the workplace, higher educational attainment improving employability and\nbetter health enabling longer careers).\nProfessional purchasing organizations emerged and grew in retailers (e.g., Walmart) and\nmanufacturers (e.g., automobiles), exerting continual year-over-year pressure on costs, and\nconsequently prices.\nAnd the federal government in the era between the early ‘90s and the Great Recession ran\nrelatively low de�cits, meaning lower in�ationary �scal impulses.\nThese forces particularly in�uenced pricing for goods. Goods in�ation for the 20 years\nending in 2019 were low at 0.4 percent per year, while services grew at 2.6 percent a year,\nleaving core in�ation near target at 1.7 percent.\nWe recognized those disin�ationary tailwinds and — as we learned their impact — adjusted\npolicy. In the context of anchored in�ation expectations, perhaps that is why we kept\nin�ation near target for so long while running what was then conventionally viewed as\naccommodative policy. With wind at our back, a lighter touch on the rudder was all it took.\n\n\fIt’s hard to remember today, but just 15 months ago, 12-month core PCE was only 1.5\npercent. But it’s quite clear, the wind conditions have shifted, at least for now. The\npandemic has been quite a storm; bringing, it seems, one short-term in�ationary shock\nafter another.\nWe saw the pandemic shift demand to goods as it simultaneously suppressed supply of\nlabor both here and abroad. We saw sizable �scal stimulus escalate demand more broadly,\nwhile excess savings perhaps reduced labor supply. We saw new variants slow our labor\nmarket recovery further. We saw a long series of atypical events — a severe winter storm in\nTexas, a �re at a chip plant in Japan, a ship lodged in the Suez Canal, a backlog in Long\nBeach — sti�e the supply chain. And, of course, most recently we’ve seen commodity price\nshocks coming out of the con�ict in Ukraine and new lockdowns in China.\nWhere have these winds taken us?\nDemand is strong and looks to remain robust, fueled by healthy business and personal\nbalance sheets, the need to replenish low inventories and state governments that are �ush\nwith cash. We may see more variants, such as the one rising in Western Europe, but we are\nlearning to live with COVID-19. Supply is tight. As demand for goods exploded in the midst\nof the pandemic, supply chains have struggled to keep up, and now to catch up.\nLabor markets are also quite tight. Unemployment has dropped to 3.6 percent. In addition,\nthe pool of available labor has shrunk: 1.6 million fewer workers are in the workforce, and\nimmigration remains well below its pre-COVID-19 trend.\nAs a result, wages are up: Average hourly earnings have risen 5.6 percent. And price\nin�ation is elevated, with core PCE at 5.4 percent — the highest since April 1983. Over the\npast year, goods in�ation has been almost 10 percent, while services in�ation has been 4.6\npercent.\nThese shocks have required us, once again, to recognize changes and adjust our course.\nInitially, we thought in�ation would be short-lived, as it seemed largely driven by temporary\nfactors like chips in cars. But the fog of the pandemic made visibility di�cult.\nNow, with in�ation persisting and broadening, we see clearly that it is time to normalize our\nmonetary policy stance. At our last meeting, the Fed decided to raise interest rates 25 basis\npoints, and the median Federal Open Market Committee member forecasted seven rate\nincreases this year and three to four next year. These forecasts project in�ation to be\ncontained as pandemic pressures ease and rates move just past the median estimate of\nneutral.\nHow far we will need to raise rates in fact won’t be clear until we get closer to our\ndestination, but rest assured we will do what we must to address this recent bout of abovetarget in�ation. And this commitment does not necessarily require a hard landing. In fact, it\nmight help avoid one by convincing individuals and �rms that the Fed is committed to our\ntarget, thereby cementing in�ation expectations.\n\n\fAn interesting question for me is: Once these speci�c pandemic-era wind gusts fade, what\ndirection will the winds be blowing going forward?\nThere are a few reasons to think we may face more headwinds when it comes to containing\nin�ation going forward. That is, we may need to navigate in the context of more mediumterm in�ationary pressure than we have experienced during the Great Moderation.\nOver the last few years, we’ve seen tari�s, the pandemic, and the Ukrainian con�ict lay bare\nthe vulnerabilities associated with o�shoring and a globally complex supply chain. Moving\nforward, we are likely to see some deglobalization, as countries rethink their trading\nrelationships and �rms redesign their supply chains to prioritize resiliency, not just\ne�ciency. These changes would suggest higher costs and less ability for intermediaries to\ndrive year-over-year e�ciencies.\nWe may also see labor transition from being long to short. O�shore labor may prove less\navailable. At the same time, our population is aging. Birth rates are declining. We missed\nout on millions of immigrants during the pandemic. Reduced labor force growth can limit\ngrowth in the broader economy. And unless we can �nd a way to reduce labor demand\n(e.g., through automation) or increase participation (as Japan has done with older workers),\na tighter labor market could also pressure wages, and in turn, prices.\nFiscal policy may also be shifting in a way that contributes to the headwinds. Government\nde�cits are still running at historic levels, and entitlement spending will grow further as the\npopulation ages. Defense spending may grow as well. The coming investment in climate\ntransition risks elevating energy costs in the interim.\nFinally, the Great Moderation was marked by a relatively stable external environment. Who\nknows what the future holds.\nIf we �nd ourselves facing this “series of unfortunate events,” we will recognize headwinds\nthat become persistent and adjust how we navigate. Our goal — 2 percent target in�ation\n— wouldn’t change, nor would our longer-run ability to meet that goal, but the appropriate\npath to achieve it could.\nShould the prevailing winds shift, we would be more likely to face periods with real forces\nimparting near-term in�ationary pressure. These pressures could make “looking through”\nshort-term shocks more di�cult. As a consequence, our e�orts to stabilize in�ation\nexpectations could require periods where we tighten monetary policy more than has been\nour recent pattern. You might think of this as leaning against the wind. Doing so would be\nconsistent with our �exible average in�ation targeting framework.\nCommunicating e�ectively could also prove more challenging. In�ationary pressure puts\nconstantly on the table the potential for a trade-o� between employment and in�ation, our\ndual mandate goals. In contrast, the last 10 years have seen little con�ict between our goals\nin making policy, and so the Fed’s decisions have been relatively easier to explain. We will\nneed to be crystal clear that a growing economy requires stable prices, and that we will\nremain committed to addressing in�ationary gusts.\n\n\fWe don’t need to make any of these judgments now. It is notoriously di�cult to pinpoint\nshifts in the weather, and the old joke is that economic forecasting was invented to make\nweather forecasters look good. Innovations happen, and it’s of course possible that\ntechnology will again create tailwinds we haven’t anticipated. Without perfect foresight, the\nbest short-term path for us is to move rapidly to the neutral range and then test whether\npandemic-era in�ation pressures are easing, and how persistent in�ation has become. If\nnecessary, we can move further.\nLonger term, I am paying attention to the global forces I’ve described — whether they\noccur, in fact, and what impact they have on in�ationary pressures. If we see headwinds\npersisting, we will do what we need to do to trim the sails.\nThis re�ects the di�erence in total nonfarm payroll employment between February 2020 and\nMarch 2022.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nInvesting in Rural America Conference\n\n• Every month, I visit small towns and hear directly from business and community\nleaders about what’s working, what’s not working and what they need. And\neverywhere — across every issue — I hear one critical need that constrains how\nmuch change a community can make: money.\n• Multiple rounds of federal stimulus means that billions of dollars are being made\navailable for small towns across the country, on top of those available through\nprivate grant-makers.\n• This is a game-changing amount of money. But wherever I go, local leaders say it will\nbe very di�cult to access. Why is that? I hear three key barriers. First, grants are\ncomplicated. Second, they often require organizations to raise money. Third, there’s\na bias towards experience.\n• Communities need help building their capacity, and they need it now. They need help\n�nding and training leadership. They need help writing grant applications that meet\nfunder speci�cations. They need help acquiring match funding. They need help\ndistributing and administering funds e�ectively. And they need help assessing\nimpact.\n\nThanks for joining us today. This the fourth time we have brought rural practitioners\ntogether and our third attempt to do so in North Carolina. I’m so pleased that COVID-19 has\n�nally decided to cooperate. On the bright side, the pandemic taught us virtual could work\nand massively extend our reach. So, welcome to all of you joining us online.\nAt the Richmond Fed, we are committed to understanding the unique challenges faced by\nthe many small towns across our district. The data is clear. On average, small towns have\n\n\flower employment rates, less educational attainment and worse health outcomes than\nbigger cities. These communities are too often distanced from quality jobs, transportation,\nchild care and anchor institutions. This isolation can be deepened by a lack of adequate\nbroadband to stay connected. And we all know that COVID-19 exacerbated these issues —\nwhich we discussed at last year’s conference.\nI don’t need to linger on the challenges. The practitioners in this room know them better\nthan anyone. Every month, I visit small towns and hear directly from business and\ncommunity leaders about what’s working, what’s not working and what they need. And\neverywhere — across every issue — I hear one critical need that constrains how much\nchange a community can make: money.\nBut we are in a unique moment. Multiple rounds of federal stimulus (combined with\nhealthy state and local government balance sheets) means that billions of dollars are being\nmade available for small towns across the country, on top of those available through\nprivate grant-makers.\nBut getting access to all this funding is hard. And not without reason: We want\ngovernments to be careful with our tax dollars. Funders only want to invest if they can be\nconvinced they will see impact. But the constraints they place on accessing funding don’t\nalways align with local capacity, needs and opportunities.\nToday, I want to talk about some of the funding that is available, the barriers small towns\nface in accessing this funding and what those of us who want to make a di�erence can do\nto reduce these barriers.\nLet’s start with the funding itself. At the federal level, the opportunities are breathtaking.\nThere are grants to support environmentally impacted communities, to rebuild food supply\nchains, to build infrastructure, to connect communities technologically, to �nance\ninnovation, to provide access to quality health care in places without local hospitals or\nproviders and to fund pandemic recovery.\nTaken together, the available funds have the potential to move the needle on some key\nrural challenges. Look at\nOur research has suggested that it could cost roughly\n$80 billion to get ubiquitous broadband coverage across the country. If we take the money\ndedicated to broadband before the pandemic, the additional funds available through\npandemic relief bills, plus the allocations within the infrastructure bill, there is nearly 50\npercent more than that appropriated. If I did my math right, that’s more than enough to\nclose the gap.\nHow about\nAlmost $20 billion has already been distributed to providers in\nrural or small metropolitan areas. And there’s more to come from additional grants\ndesigned to strengthen rural community health by focusing on quality and access.\nOn\nthe American Rescue Plan Act allocated funds for COVID-19-related\ntransit within rural areas and to support bus travel within these areas. For example, the\nRural Formula Program provides capital, planning and operating assistance to support\n\n\fpublic transportation. Plus, there's money to support the completion of the Appalachian\nDevelopment Highway System.\nThis is a game-changing amount of money. But wherever I go, local leaders say it will be\nvery di�cult to access. Why is that? I hear three key barriers.\nThey require intensive research and documentation.\nApplications are often dozens — or even hundreds — of pages long, requiring sophisticated\ndata interpretation, technical writing and dozens of attachments. And the administrative\nrequirements can feel burdensome. Many organizations don’t have the necessary time or\nexpertise, particularly for grants that require unique data. For example, ARC POWER grants\nhelp coal-impacted communities. But we heard from one recipient that organizations\nshould set aside a whole month for the application process. And ARC is regarded by\ngrantees as one of the more �exible federal agencies — Economic Development\nAdministration (EDA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other agency grant\nprograms are often more restrictive and more complicated. Grant processes can be\ncomplicated for the agency making the grant too, which all too often �nds itself\nundersta�ed.\nMany grants require matching\nfunds that small communities can’t raise. For example, the Rural Surface Transportation\nGrant Program requires a 20 percent match. Sometimes funders will allow applicants to\nwaive match requirements, but that waiver can still lead to a lower application score.\nAdditionally, you usually can't match federal grants with other federal funds — even from\nanother agency. This means you need private funders or local governments that are ready\nto step up and provide time-sensitive match commitments, which often isn't possible in\nresource-constrained rural communities. Because of this, some low-resource communities\neither self-select out of applying for grants, or they signi�cantly downgrade the size of their\nprojects.\nGrantors quite naturally prefer to invest with\nsomeone they have con�dence has the capacity to deliver. So, they favor organizations with\na proven track record or with a leader they already know, which can leave less experienced\norganizations and under-resourced regions out of the running. It is possible, or even likely,\nthat the lion's share of federal funds will �ow to the institutions and organizations that are\nalready established and well-resourced.\nCommunities need help building their capacity, and they need it now. They need help\n�nding and training leadership. They need help writing grant applications that meet funder\nspeci�cations. They need help acquiring match funding. They need help distributing and\nadministering funds e�ectively. And they need help assessing impact.\nSo, let’s help them. The stimulus money is coming, so let’s leverage states, localities,\nfoundations and local organizations to get the money where it is most needed. I’m struck\nby the experience we all just had with rent relief and the varying degrees of success\n\n\fcommunities had in delivering that money to its intended recipients. As I have tried to think\nabout it, I see three tangible, practical opportunities, and you might see even more.\nThis could be done by hiring or funding experienced,\nproven grant writers directly. There is subject matter expertise out there, and foundations\ncan play a meaningful role helping to connect experts to small towns with opportunities.\nAlternatively, this could be done by providing targeted advice. For example, Generation\nWest Virginia and the Benedum Foundation work together to provide communities with\ngrant writing support and other forms of technical assistance to coach them through the\ncomplicated process of planning for and accessing broadband funding.\nThis could be a great role for states. If match funding is\nthe barrier, create a pool which goes to communities and local organizations that earn the\nmatch. Localities with excess funds coming out of the pandemic could step up too. This\nwould increase the number of grants applied for and productively leverage local money\nwith federal money. And anything a state can do to adequately resource the distribution of\nfunds would be of value too.\nI am intrigued by the idea of “rural development hubs,” as\nde�ned by the Aspen Community Strategies Group. These regional organizations build local\ncapacity. They foster creative development strategies and build connections between\nstates, funders and localities. They are close to their communities’ needs and wants. They\nserve as conveners, coordinators and intermediaries for grassroots e�orts, allowing\ncollections of projects and organizations to come together and pursue funding and\nstrategies that are only possible through collaboration.\nBut hubs take time to build, and they’re hard to start from scratch. Regional collaboration is\ndi�cult, as communities struggle to balance collaboration and competition for scarce\nresources. And some of the challenges to building hubs are similar to the challenges in\naccessing grant funding: They’re costly to launch and to scale.\nTo build local capacity for the long run, organizations need targeted support in the near\nterm. For example, funding from Rural LISC — a national organization — allowed the\nGarrett County Community Action Committee to expand to serve adjoining counties.\nFunders can also seed promising new approaches. The West Virginia Community\nDevelopment hub, which Stephanie Tyree will tell you more about today, often heard\ncomplaints that there was “nothing going on” in West Virginia. They created the Cultivate\nWest Virginia program, which distributes small-scale investments over a short time period\nto build momentum in communities. Teams of volunteers work alongside a coach to\nidentify needed projects, often leading to a broader shared vision. With this foundation, the\ncommunities can then collaborate on a larger scale. They start with small projects, like\ncreating a new welcome sign, and eventually, they are redeveloping their historic school\nthat’s been out of use for 30 years.\nCapacity building isn’t limited to local communities. Regionally, the Central Appalachian\n\n\fNetwork provides space for like-minded organizations to coordinate projects across state\nlines and to participate in regional sector development strategies, accessing federal funding\nfor large-scale initiatives related to local and regional food systems, clean energy\ndevelopment, waste reduction and workforce development. They help grow organizational\ncapacity through peer learning, mentorship and shared resources. New platforms like\nInvest Appalachia o�er a pathway for grant-funded projects and enterprises to transition\ntoward �nancial self-su�ciency, partnering with other �nancial intermediaries like\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to provide a blend of capital that\nincludes credit enhancements and �exible �nancing. And, while I know it isn’t rural, I was\nimpressed when I was in Petersburg, Virginia, last month to learn about an industryfocused regional cluster, which is attracting funding to build infrastructure that supports\nthe growth of that town and its pharmaceutical industry.\nHelping communities write grants, creating pools of match funding and supporting hubs to\nhelp build local capacity aren’t the only ways we can help small towns access this historic\nopportunity for funding. Perhaps there are better ideas than these, which I of course\nwelcome and hope we can surface today. Getting money to communities that need it isn’t\neasy. But this is a unique moment.\nThanks, and enjoy the conference.\nThank you to Abigail Crockett and Chantel Gerardo for assistance preparing these remarks. I\nwould also like to thank Andrew Crosson, Chris Estes, Jen Giovannitti, Emma Pepper, Bonita\nRobertson-Hardy, Jorge Rodriguez-Stanley, Charles Rutheiser, Stephanie Tyree and Duane\nYoder for their feedback.\n\nSmall Town and Rural Communities\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\n\fEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nMaryland Bankers Association\nFirst Friday Economic Outlook Forum\n\n• It’s time to begin to normalize rates. The worst of the pandemic is behind us, and we\nare 22 months into the fastest recovery in our memory.\n• The economy is no longer in need of aggressive Fed support. Instead, we need to put\nourselves in a position to contain in�ation. It’s our job to do so — the Fed’s mandate\nrequires us to promote stable prices.\n• Some worry that raising rates to control in�ation necessarily drives the economy into\na recession. And with the surge in energy prices since the Ukraine invasion, some\neven raise the topic of stag�ation — a word from the 70s. The rate path we\nannounced this week shouldn’t drive economic decline. We are still far from the level\nof rates that constrains the economy.\n• Prior to our meeting, there was much debate about whether the Fed should move\nfaster. We have moved at a 50-basis point clip in the past, and we certainly could do\nso again if we start to believe that is necessary to prevent in�ation expectations from\nunanchoring. But setting the right pace for rate increases is a balancing act — we\nnormalize rates to contain in�ation, but if we overcorrect, we can negatively impact\nemployment, which is the other part of our dual mandate.\n\nThanks for having me today. It’s great to be back in front of this group, and — while I regret\nthat we had to reschedule from January — the timing might actually be better, as the world\nhas gotten even more complicated, and the Fed has been in the news this week. So, today, I\nwant to talk about the economy, but particularly about the topic that put the Fed in the\nnews: interest rates. I caution these are my views alone and not necessarily those of any of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve\n\n\fSystem.\nYou all likely saw that at this week’s FOMC meeting, the Fed decided to raise interest rates\n25 basis points. In our statement, we said that we anticipate that “ongoing increases in the\ntarget range will be appropriate” in order to return in�ation to our 2 percent objective. The\nmedian member of the FOMC forecasted 7 rate hikes this year and 3-4 next year, moving\nrates modestly over most estimates of the neutral rate. In his press conference, the chair\nsaid we would start to reduce the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting, and that\ncould be as early as May.\nIt’s time to begin to normalize rates. The worst of the pandemic is behind us, and we are 22\nmonths into the fastest recovery in our memory. By the end of this quarter, GDP will likely\nexceed not only its pre-pandemic level, but perhaps also its pre-pandemic trend line.\nConsumer spending is strong, business investment is healthy and the housing market is\nhot. Underlying demand looks to remain robust, fueled by healthy business and personal\nbalance sheets, the need to replenish low inventories and state governments that are �ush\nwith cash. We may see more variants — possibly the one rising today in Western Europe —\nbut we are learning to live with COVID-19.\nWe now are facing a di�erent challenge: in�ation. As demand for goods exploded in the\nmidst of the pandemic, supply chains struggled to keep up. Labor markets also became\nquite tight. Unemployment has dropped to 3.8 percent. In addition, the pool of those\nlooking for a job has shrunk: Two million fewer workers are in the workforce, and\nimmigration remains well below its pre-COVID-19 trend. Consequently, wages are up:\nAverage hourly earnings have risen 5.1 percent. And price in�ation is elevated, with core\nPCE at 5.2 percent — the highest since April 1983. At �rst, these conditions seemed\ntemporary, but they have persisted and broadened — making in�ation the headline of the\nday and causing more and more �rms to consider raising their own prices.\nAll of this means the economy is no longer in need of aggressive Fed support. Instead, we\nneed to put ourselves in a position to contain in�ation. It’s our job to do so — the Fed’s\nmandate requires us to promote stable prices.\nYou might ask how raising rates contains in�ation. The answer varies over di�erent time\nhorizons.\nShort-term changes in in�ation tend to be driven by factors outside of the Fed’s control.\nThink about the aftermath of a hurricane. Lumber prices increase temporarily as demand\nspikes for materials to make necessary repairs. An interest rate move wouldn’t a�ect that\ndynamic. Nor should it try to: These price movements should reverse themselves with no\nassistance from us. Well, we are still working through the destructive impact caused by the\npandemic and now geopolitics. In�ation continues to be impacted by supply chain\nshortages, low labor force participation and the ebb and �ow of the virus — most recently\ncausing lockdowns in Shenzhen, China. And Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has a�ected prices\nof commodities like energy, aluminum, wheat and nickel.\n\n\fIn the medium and long term, on the other hand, the Fed’s rate moves certainly do\nin�uence in�ation. Milton Friedman’s famous analysis showed that monetary policy\noperates with a lag, which he called “long and variable.”\nOne part of how we in�uence in�ation is quite tangible. Against a backdrop of stable\nin�ation expectations, we raise rates and that reduces demand and eventually prices.\nDeposit rates increase, thereby creating more incentive to save rather than spend. The\ndollar appreciates, lessening demand for exports and lowering the price of imports.\nBorrowing rates rise, reducing capital investment and consumer spending. That’s\nparticularly true in interest-sensitive sectors like housing, auto and consumer durables. You\nare already seeing mortgage rates go up, for example.\nAnother part is less tangible and occurs through a psychological e�ect over the longer\nterm. Individuals and �rms build expectations about future in�ation. Firms then make their\npricing and compensation decisions — and individuals make their purchase and\nemployment decisions — in the context of those expectations. If the Fed does its part to\ncontrol in�ation, expectations and price and wage increases stay stable and anchored. If\nnot, they don’t, as you might argue has been happening in Turkey.\nHappily, so far, U.S. expectations seem to have stayed stable. Long-term market measures\nof in�ation compensation, derived from the TIPS indices, remain in line with our 2 percent\ntarget despite short-term in�ation and in�ation expectations at multidecade highs.\nSimilarly, the Michigan Survey of 5-10-year in�ation expectations has only increased\nmodestly. Both are at levels comparable to 2013 and 2014.\nSome worry that raising rates to control in�ation necessarily drives the economy into a\nrecession. And with the surge in energy prices since the Ukraine invasion, some even raise\nthe foottopic of stag�ation — a word from the 70s. The rate path we announced this week\nshouldn’t drive economic decline. We are still far from the level of rates that constrains the\neconomy; for my colleagues on the FOMC, this would be somewhere above their long-term\nprojections for the neutral rate, which ranges from 2-3 percent. This week’s move still\nleaves us a good 9-10 rate increases away from that point. So, instead of thinking about the\nupcoming cycle of rate increases as foreshadowing a coming recession, think of it as an\nindication that the extraordinary support of the pandemic era is unwinding. We are\nreducing that support gradually so that we can get back to a more normal position as the\neconomic situation evolves. At that time, we can decide if we need to put the brakes on the\neconomy or not.\nPrior to our meeting, there was much debate about whether the Fed should move faster.\nWe have moved at a 50-basis point clip in the past, and we certainly could do so again if we\nstart to believe that is necessary to prevent in�ation expectations from unanchoring. But\nsetting the right pace for rate increases is a balancing act — we normalize rates to contain\nin�ation, but if we overcorrect, we can negatively impact employment, which is the other\npart of our dual mandate. And we have some time to get to a neutral position. In�ation and\nemployment are still being heavily in�uenced by pandemic-era supply and participation\n\n\fpressures — and more recently, the war on Ukraine — and it will take a while for us to\nunderstand and meet the dynamics of the post-pandemic economy.\nBen Bernanke once said that monetary policy is a collaborative endeavor: Clear\ncommunication and steady movement guide markets in ways that reinforce our messaging.\nIn contrast, market surprises sometimes lead to tightened �nancial conditions that can\ncause the real economy to pull back more than we intend. So, it’s worth noting that the\nbond market seems to already be taking our direction. As we have signaled a rate change\nover the last few months, market rates have moved signi�cantly. The two-year treasury\nyield has gone from 0.28 in September (as of Sept. 30 close) to 1.95 (as of March 16 close)\ntoday. The �ve-year has moved from 0.98 (as of Sept. 30 close) to 2.18 (as of March 16\nclose). So, while we could move faster, we are already having more impact than you might\nthink.\nWhile the proven and more important tool is rates, our balance sheet moves can work in\nthe background to reinforce this rate path. As a reminder, we began purchasing treasuries\nand mortgage-backed securities to stabilize �nancial markets in March 2020, and then\ncontinued them to support the economy through the pandemic. Our balance sheet is now\nabout 9 trillion in assets, up from 4.2 trillion pre-pandemic. As we start to normalize rates, it\nis appropriate to start to normalize the balance sheet as well, and we will begin to do that\nsoon. There is a reasonable amount of debate in the literature and in the �nancial markets\nabout the impact of balance sheet reduction. For me, it’s pretty simple: Our purchases\nreduced rates in a modest fashion; our reductions should have a symmetric e�ect and\nincrease medium-term rates modestly, thereby supporting our desired rate trajectory.\nTo close, I want to talk about what I’ll be keeping an eye on in the coming months: demand,\nsupply and pricing. While I think all three of these areas should normalize, there are still\nunanswered questions. Demand should calm as rates increase, excess savings are spent,\nand we work through the current oil price shocks, but how much, how quickly, and in what\nmix of goods and services? Supply should recover as COVID-19 recedes, supply chains are\nremediated and workers rejoin the workforce. But how long will this take, and how much\nupside does the labor force have? And in�ation should move toward target as pandemic\nand geopolitical pressures ease and policy normalizes. But how fast will that happen, and\nwhat will be the impact of this period on in�ation expectations? These answers will dictate\nthe pace with which we use our tools; put another way, they will provide us with ongoing\nfeedback about how to adjust policy in order to keep in�ation expectations anchored and\nkeep in�ation on a medium-term path back to our 2 percent target.\nI hope this was a useful way for you to understand how to think about policy and how we\nuse our tools — and now I am open to questions.\nThis re�ects the di�erence in total nonfarm payroll employment between February 2020 and\nFebruary 2022.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nIn�ation has become the focus of conversation. But in its shadow — and partially pulling\nthe strings — is tightness in the labor market. Employers continue to struggle to bring in\nnew workers and keep existing ones. Job openings far outnumber individuals looking for\nwork. Absenteeism is elevated due to COVID-19. Jobs are still down by nearly three million.\nImmigration remains far below its pre-COVID-19 trend. As a result of this tightness, wages\nare up 4.5 percent, the highest year-over-year growth in over 20 years.\nDiscussion about this labor shortage has focused on demographics. We have written about\nthe surge in retirees and how child care challenges have pushed mothers out of the labor\nforce. But it is also useful to look at the dynamics by sector. I hear very di�erent stories in\nthree distinct segments of the economy: low-paying personal services, in-demand skilled\ntrades and remote-friendly professionals.\nThe low-paying personal services segment was heavily disrupted by the pandemic. In\naccommodation and food services, for example, employment fell by nearly 50 percent\nbetween February and April 2020, and the workforce is still 1.5 million short of prepandemic levels. This segment has seen the fastest wage growth and highest quits rates.\nWages for accommodation and food services, for example, grew 9.3 percent year-overyear. Their quits rate hit record highs.\nThis pressure doesn’t seem to be a demand issue, as revenue for many of these services\nremains short of pre-pandemic levels. The story here is labor supply. Workers have left the\nsegment — perhaps because it now seems less stable, perhaps because of concern about\nCOVID-19, perhaps because of working conditions (including the need to wear masks), or\nperhaps because of child care responsibilities.\nImportantly, these workers see better alternatives. Many have entered industries that grew\nduring the pandemic, such as transportation and warehousing (up more than 500,000\njobs). Others have taken advantage of a hot labor market to take entry-level positions now\no�ering much higher pay. Others are leveraging their excess savings to be choosier about\n\n\fwhen they rejoin the workforce.\nAs demand returns in this segment, employers are investing in higher wages, enhanced\nsearch e�orts, and productivity and automation initiatives to bring supply and demand\nback into balance. I suspect they will also need to think about working conditions that\nmatch the needs of those labor market segments who could be attracted from the\nsidelines, like students, parents and retirees. Topics like scheduling, child care, job design\nand screening criteria are being considered by innovative employers.\nThe issues in skilled trades (think nursing, trucking and manufacturing, for example) are\ndi�erent. These sectors typically require credentials or licenses and were already facing\ntight labor markets prior to the pandemic. Labor supply is quite inelastic in the short run,\nand these sectors have been unable to keep up with pandemic levels of demand.\nWages and quits in these industries aren’t as elevated as in low-paying services, but they\ntoo have escalated against their historic norms. Wages in manufacturing, for example, grew\n4.1 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021, nearly a percentage point higher\nthan the fastest growth the industry had seen in any quarter since the Great Recession. Its\nquits rate remains near the industry’s record high hit in September.\nThe story in many skilled trades is increased demand. Trucking and construction are\nbooming. And, despite supply chain challenges, industrial production in manufacturing has\nalready surpassed where it was pre-pandemic. Perhaps the growth in manufacturing and\ntrucking isn’t too surprising given that — at its recent peak — consumer spending on goods\nwas 20 percent higher than pre-pandemic. Labor demand re�ects that recovery. If\nmanufacturers could �ll every open position, they’d be 200,000 jobs above where they\nwould have been had they done the same in February 2020.\nSkilled trades have a pipeline problem, and it may be getting worse. Community colleges,\nwhich play a central role in preparing workers for these jobs, have seen enrollment decline\nover the past two years. The decline may well be explained by increased wages raising the\nopportunity cost of education, but it puts the economy further away from building the\nnecessary pipeline of workers for these sectors.\nEmployers and localities will need to take ownership of their education, training and\ncredentialing pipelines. Employers can provide their own training, or can partner with\ncommunity colleges to provide equipment, instructors and apprenticeship opportunities.\nStates can simplify their licensing requirements and debottleneck their credentialing\nprocesses. They can also work to expand the pipeline by providing more holistic funding to\nstudents pursuing noncredit programs.\nThe remote-friendly professional segment has seen less trauma. Layo�s were rarer in the\npandemic. Demand stayed robust. Work got done. Financial activities, information, and\nprofessional and technical services have all seen employment recover since February 2020,\nwith the latter adding more than half a million jobs.\nThis segment has also been tight, though perhaps somewhat less than its late ‘90s peak.\n\n\fFor example, the most elevated quits rates for information and �nancial activities during\nthe pandemic were still more than half a percentage point below their record high rates in\n2001.\nThe story here is what may be to come. Now that we are nearing the end of the pandemic,\nwe hear widespread stories of professionals reassessing their careers. Many are su�ering\nfrom burnout: workers experiencing “loyalty punishment” as their workloads increased\nwhen colleagues left. Employers will also need to navigate emerging mismatches, especially\non work preferences. During COVID-19, employee preferences evolved, on remote work\nand even on where they chose to live. As I’ve written, it’s not yet clear which model of work\nwill optimize business performance and talent retention. But, regardless, it is likely a\nnumber of workers will �nd themselves mismatched against their employer’s intended\noperating model and emboldened to explore alternatives by the strong labor market. So,\nwe may well see further pressure in this segment, requiring employers to change the\nnarrative to meet the needs of a workforce that has become more demanding.\nWhether it be a lack of supply, an abundance of demand, or a new set of worker demands,\nemployers feel the pressure and are now innovating to try to address the unique workforce\nissues that a�ect their particular industry. We are monitoring their e�orts closely, in hopes\nthat a return to balance will in turn reduce pressure on in�ation.\nWage data throughout this essay refers to the Employment Cost Index.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\n\fSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nInvesting in Rural America\n\nSince joining the Richmond Fed in 2018, I have visited small towns all across our District,\nfrom the coasts to the mountains. Some of these communities are thriving—perhaps\nthey’ve been able to capitalize on natural endowments, or they’ve partnered with\nneighboring towns, or they’ve found a creative source of funding. But other communities\nare struggling. They’ve lost employers, residents, or both; their infrastructure is in poor\nrepair; or they’re isolated, geographically and digitally, from necessities like banking or\nhealth care.\nAt the Richmond Fed, we’re committed to learning from the towns that are making it work\nso that we can help those that are facing challenges. That’s the goal of our third annual\nInvesting in Rural America conference, which brings together community leaders and local\n\n\fand national experts in rural development. This year’s event takes place on March 30 in\nGreensboro, N.C., and features a virtual attendance option as well. The conference is one of\nthe many ways—along with Rural America Week, our Community Conversations, and our\nongoing research—that we learn about and share promising strategies for improving\neconomic outcomes in smaller towns.\nWe’re in a unique moment. While COVID-19 continues to exacerbate the challenges many\ncommunities face, small towns also have unprecedented opportunities to invest in their\nfuture. Multiple pandemic relief bills, combined with the recent Infrastructure Investment\nand Jobs Act, have made billions of dollars available for investments in broadband,\ntransportation, health care, climate resilience, and more. But many towns don’t have the\nhuman or technical capacity they need to apply for grants or distribute funding, which is\nwhy building that capacity will be the subject of our afternoon plenary at the upcoming\nconference.\nPhysical infrastructure is crucial, but it’s not the only place we need to invest if we want\nsmaller communities to realize their potential. We must also invest in their workforce.\nCommunity colleges have a key role to play. They are the �rst college experience for many\nlow-income students. They provide the skills people need to land good jobs and can\nconnect students to employers, or they can help students prepare for a four-year degree.\nThey also o�er certi�cate programs that can deliver new skills in a relatively short period of\ntime. Unfortunately, community college enrollment has been declining slowly for years, and\nthe pandemic exacerbated these declines, especially for students of color. I fear that a\ngeneration of workers is passing on the opportunity to build their skills. So I’m looking\nforward to our conversation at the conference with community college leaders from our\nDistrict about how we can support these institutions and the people they serve.\nAnother key area for investment is early care and education. It’s well known that early\neducation is critical for children—and the pandemic has underscored how critical it is for\nparents, especially mothers, to be able to participate in the workforce. Even beyond\npandemic-related issues, child care centers face a challenging cost structure, which can\nmake them especially di�cult to open and operate in smaller towns. Nearly 60 percent of\nrural communities meet the de�nition of a “child care desert.” Adults in rural areas are\nmore likely to work during non-standard hours, which can make it hard to �nd care that\nmeets their needs. And even where child care is available, it’s often una�ordable for\nfamilies. That’s why strengthening our early care system will be the subject of another of\nour panels, with child care experts from throughout the region.\nWe’ll also address housing. High-quality housing that’s a�ordable for lower- and middleincome workers is in short supply in rural areas, for a variety of reasons. These include\nolder housing stock, less multifamily development, and the increasing cost of construction,\namong other factors. Communities end up stuck in a vicious cycle: People don’t move to\nrural areas because they can’t �nd housing, but developers don’t want to invest without\npotential buyers and renters. This in turn can in�uence employers’ location decisions,\n\n\fbecause they aren’t going to set up shop without a workforce to draw from. We’ll hear from\nrural leaders about how nonpro�ts, lenders and community organizations can lead to the\ndevelopment of quality, a�ordable housing for the rural workforce.\nFinally, we’ll talk about how we can support aspiring entrepreneurs and small business\nowners in rural areas. It’s true that most small businesses don’t grow into the next Google\nor Amazon—but it’s also true that a business doesn’t have to be one of these “unicorns” to\nbene�t a community.\nOverall, more sole proprietorships and small businesses in an area are associated with\nmore job growth and better overall economic health and resiliency. Prior to the pandemic,\nstartup rates had been declining for decades—but we’ve seen an encouraging burst of\nstartup activity recently. I’m optimistic that communities will be able to take advantage of\nthis moment to help build thriving entrepreneurial networks.\nWe hope you’ll be able to join us on March 30, either in person or online, for rich\ndiscussions about investing in our small towns—for their sake, and for the economic health\nof our country as a whole.\nCenter for American Progress, “America’s Child Care Deserts in 2018,” Dec. 6, 2018.\n\nSmall Town and Rural Communities\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nVirginia Bankers Association and Virginia Chamber of Commerce\n2022 Financial Forecast\n\n• I take �ve key lessons from 2021. First, COVID-19 still impacts our growth, but it has\nlargely become a supply side and in�ationary challenge. Second, government\nsupport helped bridge our economy through the initial shock, but we may also be\nseeing other e�ects. Third, our supply chains were too lean to support the wide\nswings in demand. Fourth, power has shifted to labor as demand has exceeded\nsupply. Finally, the word transitory did not serve its intended purpose, as in�ation\nhas lasted longer than many expected.\n• These lessons help shape my outlook for 2022. While there are many unknowns\nahead, I expect increases in household balance sheets to sustain demand for quite\nsome time. It may take a year or longer to get to the other side of supply chain\npressures, but they will eventually catch up. Labor will remain short. Prices will cause\nconsumers to adjust as savings erode, and wages will bring people o� the sidelines.\n• But what will happen to the path for in�ation? I am closely watching the prices for\ngoods versus services. Will they continue on their historic paths or will present\nadjustments persist? How these two sectors net out will matter as the Fed continues\nto work to meet its stable price mandate.\n• In terms of policy, we have started the process of normalization, but the timing and\npace of any future rate moves will depend on the answer to my question on\nin�ation.\n\nThanks for having me here. The last time I was with you in person was two years ago. At the\ntime, the question was how long our historically long 10-year upturn could last. I remember\nsaying that expansions don’t die of old age — they die of a heart attack. I guess my point\n\n\fwas right, but for sure I had the wrong disease.\nIt’s hard to believe we’ve now been dealing with this pandemic for two years. From an\neconomist’s point of view, we had the deepest but also the shortest recession in memory.\nSo now, technically, we are in the midst of a 20-month recovery. And not just any recovery.\nThis one is historic.\nToday, I thought I might look back and then look forward. We’ve learned a lot that will help\ninform where the economy goes from here. These thoughts represent, of course, my views\nonly and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. So, what did\nwe learn in 2021? I took �ve lessons.\n\nIn 2020, the pandemic drove uncertainty and lockdowns, which in turn meant job loss and\nspending that was depressed and de�ationary at �rst and then rotated to goods over\nservices. In 2021, vaccines largely freed demand from COVID-19’s control (except for a few\nsectors like business travel). Despite the delta variant, consumer spending more than fully\nrecovered, and we saw the highest number of job openings on record.\nBut the COVID-19 economic threat — much like the virus — has evolved. You can see that\nwith the omicron variant. Cases have spiked. But, as the virus starts to become perceived as\nmore endemic than pandemic, U.S. communities are no longer closing down. Demand,\nespecially for goods, remains healthy. But uncertainty around health, child care and inperson schooling suppresses labor force participation. Outbreaks internationally disrupt\nglobal supply chains. So COVID-19 has now largely become a supply side and in�ationary\nchallenge. We saw that with air travel over the holidays. People want to �y. We just can’t\n�nd enough �ight crews.\n\nHistoric levels of government support helped bridge workers, small businesses, and heavily\nimpacted industries to the other side of the initial economic shock. It fueled this strong\nrecovery. GDP is now 1.4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2019 and will likely soon even\nsurpass the pre-COVID-19 trend line.\nBut these actions had consequences. Stimulus created strong demand, especially for\ngoods, which are up 16 percent. That demand broke supply chains. Workers were slow to\nreturn to the labor force, perhaps supported by these transfer payments. And of course,\nwe’ve seen a considerable increase in the national debt.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, productivity meant lean operations, global supply chains, just-intime inventories and �exible labor models.\nCOVID-19 exposed those strategies. As demand ebbed then spiked, manufacturers lost\ncontrol. Input shortages, transportation challenges and labor constraints proliferated. We\n\n\fall understood when auto manufacturers shut down in the context of lockdowns, but who\nexpected they would have to shut down again last year due to a lack of chips?\n\nWe’ve been living for decades in a world of excess workers, driven by the baby boom,\nimproved health, women in the workforce, immigration and o�shoring. These kept wages\nand bene�ts, and e�ectively cost-driven in�ation, down.\nBut in 2021, the tables turned. Labor is now painfully short. Workforce participation has\nstayed remarkably stagnant since the spring at around 1.5 percentage points below the\npre-pandemic level. 3.6 million fewer people are working. We see fewer retirees returning\nto work, more parents leaving the workforce and countless workers reassessing their lives.\nQuits are at record highs. As a result, employers are raising wages, improving working\nconditions, broadening their search e�orts and becoming more �exible. 2021 saw the\nhighest wage growth since before the Great Recession, peaking at 4.7 percent in\nSeptember, according to the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker.\n\nFor much of 2021, we used the word “transitory” to describe in�ation. It tried to capture the\nidea that rising prices were connected to COVID-19 forces that should eventually dissipate,\nsuch as supply bottlenecks.\nBut as the chair said in his recent testimony, the word didn’t serve its purpose. Webster’s\nhas two de�nitions for transitory: “of brief duration” and “not persistent.” Most of us\ninterpreted it as the former, even if we meant the latter. And elevated in�ation has clearly\nlasted longer than most of us expected. On a 12-month basis, core PCE in�ation is at the\nhighest level in over 30 years.\n\nI feel obliged to start with a caveat: Forecasting isn’t easy. I’m told economic forecasters\nwere created to make weather forecasters look good. For example, in the summer of 2021,\nI thought participation would rebound strongly in the fall as schools reopened and\nenhanced unemployment bene�ts ceased. I didn’t foresee the longer-term workforce\nchallenges we face. As a result, I underestimated in�ation.\nAnd 2022 is no clearer. The path and impact of current and future COVID-19 variants is\nunknown. Congress is still debating legislation that may or may not enhance workforce\nparticipation. Consumer sentiment is weak at a time when consumer spending is strong.\nThe yield curve has been sending signals that are hard to interpret. The noise on in�ation is\nelevated, yet market indicators of in�ation compensation appear largely una�ected.\n\n\fHousehold balance sheets are �ush. Household net worth was $32 trillion higher in the\nthird quarter of 2021 than in the same period in 2019 (up 28 percent). This was driven, of\ncourse, by investment and real estate appreciation. Pandemic lifestyle changes combined\nwith government transfers created excess savings and made households more liquid as\nwell. In September, low-income families had 70 percent more cash on hand than prepandemic (albeit only $1,000), and high-income families had about 40 percent more,\naccording to JPMorgan Chase. Recent data shows those savings are starting to be spent\ndown.\nIn addition, businesses are reporting record pro�ts and strong balance sheets. Inventories\nare low and will need to be replenished. States are seeing sizable surpluses. All these will\nsustain demand for quite some time.\n\nI’m hoping to see some progress in the �rst quarter. Seasonal demand reductions should\ngive manufacturers breathing room, and some sectors will be digesting the impact of\nstockpiling last fall. But Omicron is of course a wild card here.\nAnd it will take a year or longer to get fully to the other side. Constrained labor will continue\nto hinder supply. Capacity building takes business con�dence and time. The median\nrespondent in The CFO Survey forecasts that supply constraints should last another 10-12\nmonths.\n\nThe trends have been clear for a while: Fertility is down, immigration has slowed and our\nworkforce is aging. In the last upturn, participation didn’t drop as much as predicted. But\nthe pandemic has introduced even more forces, such as unstable child and elder care and\nan expansion of the social safety net.\nWhat we may �nd is that the aberration isn’t what we see today but what we saw in the last\nupturn. Labor will likely struggle to meet coming demand. Companies are trading one\nanother’s workers, and this auction will continue until employers reduce their need for\nworkers through automation or other productivity investments. Those will take time.\n\nFor the most part, we are not seeing price levels a�ect quantity demanded the way you\nmight imagine. Retailers have prioritized availability over price. Employers are paying higher\nwages without reducing jobs. Consumers, fueled by strong savings and higher wages,\nhaven’t yet chosen to begin trading down. Labor force participation isn’t moving.\nBut price levels will eventually have an impact. Walmart merchandisers won’t abandon\neveryday low prices. Consumer savings will erode, driving them to price shop. Employers\nwill pursue lower labor strategies. Higher wages will eventually bring people o� the\nsidelines.\n\n\fOnce current in�ation pressures ease, will we return to the 1.9 percent core PCE in�ation of\nthe last 30 years? The 3.0 percent of the past two years? Or the 5.3 percent annualized\nin�ation of the last nine months? Are memories short or long?\nGiven my view on 2022, the data I’m tracking most closely are the prices for goods versus\nservices. For perspective, taking 24-month di�erences to avoid pandemic base e�ects,\nannualized CPI services in�ation has been 2.8 percent, roughly in line with the prior �ve\nyears. In contrast, annualized goods in�ation has been 6.3 percent, signi�cantly higher than\nthe prior �ve-year drop of -0.2 percent per year.\nAs supply chain pressures wane, I expect goods in�ation to reduce. But will the factors that\nhave kept goods prices in line historically (like e-commerce, retailer purchasing power, and\nglobalization) continue to have the same e�ect or not? Will supply chain redesign push\ncosts and prices up instead?\nAnd as labor shortages continue, I expect them to pressure the price of services, where\nwages are a more meaningful share of costs. But how much can and will be passed on to\ncustomers?\nHow these two sectors net out will matter as the Fed continues to work to meet its stable\nprice mandate.\nWhich brings us to policy. With the labor market tight and in�ation elevated, we have\nstarted the process of normalization. We started tapering asset purchases in November\nand then accelerated that process at our last meeting in December. At current pace, we will\nbe done in mid-March. At that time, we will be free to begin normalizing rates, should\ncircumstances support that. The timing and pace of any rate moves will depend on the\nanswer to my in�ation question. The closer that in�ation comes back to target levels, the\neasier it will be to normalize rates at a measured pace. But were in�ation to remain\nelevated and broad-based, we would need to take on normalization more aggressively, as\nwe have successfully done in the past.\nWith that said, I warned you forecasting is hard. So, I am interested in what you are seeing\nin the market and am open to your input and questions.\nThis is the change in seasonally adjusted total nonfarm employment from February 2020 to\nDecember 2021.

That makes\nthis recovery a good and necessary time to discuss how to bolster women’s\neconomic security.\n• Of the roughly 100 million adults out of the labor force, almost 60 percent are\nwomen. For many, opting out of work is the right decision, but there are others who\nwould prefer to work if not for barriers in their way.\n• The pandemic exposed barriers that have a more signi�cant impact on those with\nmore fragile economic security: family care, mismatches, incentives and health.\n• All across the country, employers are looking for workers and asking how they can\nengage them. That makes this a unique opportunity to tackle the barriers keeping\nwomen out of the labor force.\n\nFor most of us, the word that de�nes the past 19 months is “uncertainty.” Remember last\nMarch, we were asking: How does COVID-19 spread? How long can our economy be shut\ndown? Will we ever �nd an e�ective treatment or vaccine? And the uncertainty persists\ntoday: Will there be a new variant? When will supply chain disruptions clear?\nSuch extended uncertainty is exhausting, even for those of us with good, stable jobs. And\nwomen working in low-wage, high-personal contact roles and those caring for young\nchildren have even more questions: Will my employer survive? How will I stay safe at work?\nWho is going to take care of my kids if they’re quarantined from school? The idea of “same\nstorm, di�erent boats” has rarely been more evident. That makes this recovery a good and\nnecessary time to discuss how to bolster women’s economic security — how to shore up\n\n\fthose boats.\nToday I want to focus on a decision that plays an important role in women’s economic\nsecurity: participating in the labor market. Before I go further, I should note that the views I\nexpress are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System. Of the roughly 100 million\nadults out of the labor force, almost 60 percent are women. Some are students, some are\nretired, some live with a disability, and some prefer being home with their kids or parents.\nFor many, opting out of work is the right decision for that moment in their lives. But there\nare others who would prefer to work if not for barriers in their way and for whom work\nwould provide �nancial stability now and into retirement.\nWe’ve seen a lot of progress in women’s labor force participation since the mid-20th\ncentury. It’s risen across all ages, races, ethnicities, marital statuses and education levels.\nAnd the increase has been a boon for our country. It contributed to economic growth and\nrising household incomes and o�set long-term declines in men’s participation.\nBut the dramatic increase since the 60s has not been an uninterrupted climb, and it’s not\nguaranteed to continue. In fact, between 1997 and 2015, the participation rate for primeage women in the United States dropped almost 3 percentage points. Women with a high\nschool degree or less saw the largest drop. It took a historic economic expansion and tight\nlabor market to reverse that decline. By late 2019, participation had returned to 1997\nlevels. But this rise in participation didn’t mean that all the barriers had been addressed.\nNothing made that more clear than the pandemic.\nIn just two months, from February to April 2020, we erased the gains we’d seen in women’s\nlabor force participation since 2015. Unlike the Great Recession, which primarily a�ected\nmale-dominated sectors such as manufacturing and construction, the COVID-19 recession\ndisrupted the majority-female service sector. More than 12 million jobs held by women\ndisappeared, and we saw a corresponding decline in participation as many women didn’t\nseek new employment. This was especially the case for women with very young children;\ndespite being only 10 percent of the pre-pandemic workforce, they accounted for nearly 25\npercent of the COVID-19 employment decline.\nWe have made progress since last April. However, not all women have recovered equally.\nWomen with a bachelor’s degree have seen a strong recovery — one stronger than men\nwith the same level of education. In contrast, women with lower levels of education lag not\nonly college-educated women, but also their male peers. For women with only a high\nschool diploma, the remaining gap relative to the February 2020 participation rate is more\nthan double that of peer men. Minority women also lag their male peers.\nThe pandemic exposed barriers that have a more signi�cant impact on those with more\nfragile economic security — those with less sturdy boats. In my conversations, I hear about\nfour key barriers: family care, mismatches, incentives and health.\nLet’s look �rst at family care. The majority of primary caregivers are women, and the\n\n\fpandemic has spotlighted the challenges they face. School closures forced some to stay\nhome. Nursing home outbreaks shifted the focus for those with aging parents. And all of\nthis came in the middle of child care a�ordability and availability challenges that predated\nthe pandemic and only worsened with lockdowns.\nIn the past year and a half, we’ve seen some institutions make adjustments. Institutions\ninvested in on-site proctoring programs to enable parents to work. Employers are\nimplementing new bene�ts like emergency child care. We are also seeing conversations\nemerge about the longer-run challenges in the child care industry, such as labor shortages\nand slim margins despite prices many families can’t a�ord.\nWe can take some inspiration from abroad. While our prime-age women’s labor force\nparticipation has declined over the past 20 years, Canada's has increased. Research from\nthe San Francisco Fed points to parental leave policies in the two countries as a key\ndi�erentiator. The same research highlights �exible work arrangements as a driver of\nincreased women’s participation in other industrialized countries.\nThis brings me to the second barrier: mismatches. Let me talk about two: skills and\nexpectations.\nEven prior to the pandemic, we had a shortage of workers with the training and skills\nnecessary to sta� trucking �eets, manufacturing operations, nursing shifts, technology\ncompanies and construction crews. But now these shortages are even more acute as\ndemand for these sectors booms. Many of those jobs have historically been held by men.\nWomen who lost their jobs during the pandemic may not have the training and\ncerti�cations needed to access work in these sectors. Even nursing training is constrained,\nmaking it hard to switch into that �eld.\nOrganizations dedicated to helping women break further into male-dominated �elds will be\nkey. We will need to fully leverage our community colleges, and their partnerships with local\nemployers. We are seeing communities invest in whole life support. For example, in\nManassas, Virginia, local leaders used CARES Act funding to o�er eligible city residents up\nto $5,000 for program costs and wraparound services, such as child care, to help them\nsecure retraining.\nExpectations are becoming an issue too. Increasingly, we are seeing misalignment between\nthe jobs available and the jobs workers want. Potential employees expect higher workplace\n�exibility, compensation and bene�ts. At the same time, the pandemic emphasized the\ndownsides of jobs in the disproportionally-female services occupations, such as low pay,\npoor bene�ts, unpredictable schedules, unattractive work environments and instability.\nThe expectation mismatch becomes apparent in the debate about remote work. Women\nwith access to remote-friendly jobs may want to continue working in a �exible environment\nthat allows for things like school drop-o�s and pickups, or reduces the time spent\ncommuting or preparing for the workplace.\nThe third barrier is incentives. Our bene�ts system can provide critical support for women\n\n\fin need. But it can also make formal participation in the workforce a costly choice. A small\nboost in earned income can cause an individual to lose meaningful bene�ts. That’s referred\nto as a “bene�ts cli�,” and it can push women out of the workforce or toward the shadow\neconomy.\nWe see this with health insurance, as moms consider jobs that put their kids’ CHIP bene�ts\nat risk. We see it with disability insurance, which makes individuals forfeit lifelong bene�ts\nto engage in the workforce. And we see it in the tax code. We tax the �rst dollar earned by\nthe second earner at the same rate as the last dollar earned by the primary earner.\nCombined with the cost of child care and other work-related expenses, a family’s monthly\ntake-home pay may be higher without a second labor market participant.\nI won’t prescribe speci�c policy changes — that's for legislatures — but at the Richmond\nFed, we have invested in distributing a tool that helps organizations understand the\ndynamics of the cli� in their geography. We hope it will help nonpro�ts and employers\nbetter understand how bene�ts impact families’ �nancial calculus.\nThe �nal barrier is health. This often comes up in conversations about why men may be on\nthe sidelines, but it’s a key barrier for millions of women, too. More than 1 in 5 prime-age\nindividuals out of the labor force report a disability, and women make up almost half of this\ngroup (47.8%). On top of this, because women are more likely to be primary caregivers,\nthe health of their loved ones also plays a part.\nOf course, the pandemic exacerbated health challenges. Women whose jobs could not be\ndone remotely — especially those in poor health, over the age of 65, or caring for\nvulnerable loved ones — faced di�cult decisions about whether to continue working. And it\ndidn’t help that the services sector and part-time work o�er much less health insurance\nthan the economy as a whole. Getting the virus under control will be a big part of tackling\nthe health barrier in the near term.\nIn the longer term, women may be healthier and live longer on average, but they may need\nto work longer, too. To allow them to do so, we need to re-examine the jobs available, as\nJapan has done. Can we redesign jobs to accommodate older workers, with shorter shifts\nand lower physical demands?\nIn closing, I will just say that given the unique labor market we �nd ourselves in, this\nconversation about connecting women with employment is not just happening here at this\nsummit. It’s happening all across the country as employers, looking for workers, ask\nthemselves who is on the sidelines and how they can engage them. That makes this a\nunique opportunity to tackle the barriers keeping women out of the labor force. I look\nforward to the discussions today.\n\n\fAdults here refers to the civilian noninstitutionalized population, meaning individuals 16 and\nolder that are not in the military or institutionalized.

Approximately 8 million are\nunemployed and roughly 100 million are out of the labor force.\n• The pandemic has exacerbated four key barriers to employment: mismatches, family\ncare, health and incentives.\n• Overall, this is a math problem. Those on the sidelines won’t come back to the labor\nmarket unless the math makes better sense to them, whether it be child care,\nbene�ts, compensation, transportation or investment in education.\n\n\fWhat's Sidelining Workers?\n\nThis year, we’ve seen that shortages in labor supply can constrain economic growth. As\nlockdowns lifted, consumer demand picked up quickly. Job openings hit all-time records.\nBut employers in many sectors were unable to sta� to meet demand. Shockingly, that\nmeant amid this strong recovery, we saw �rms cutting hours and turning down business.\nThis scenario might seem unique to the pandemic. After all, labor market frictions should\nease once the virus is behind us, schools and child care stably reopen, the impact of\npandemic bene�ts ceases and excess savings wane. But we may �nd labor shortages\nlasting far beyond this pandemic. As our workforce ages and birthrates decline, we could\n�nd workforce availability limiting our economic growth.\nTo avoid that scenario, we need to grow our workforce. Fertility and immigration could\nhelp. But we also need to do a better job connecting individuals on the sidelines with\nemployment. This challenge predated COVID-19 and will likely persist long after. I want to\nfocus my remarks today on who is on the sidelines, why they aren’t working and how to get\nthem into the workforce. Before I dive in, I should note that the views I express are my own\nand not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nor in the Federal Reserve System.\nSo, �rst: Who is on the sidelines?\nWe have nearly 262 million people ages 16 or older in the United States. Almost 60 percent\n— roughly 154 million people — are employed. That leaves us nearly 108 million on the\nsidelines. Of those, approximately 8 million are unemployed, de�ned as actively seeking\nemployment. This translates to an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent. In South Carolina,\nthat number looks better, at 4.2 percent.\n\n\fBut, as evident in this recovery, the unemployment rate tells only a part of the story. It\nmisses the roughly 100 million individuals (about 1.8 million in South Carolina) who aren’t\nworking and haven’t recently looked for work. Disproportionately, those out of the labor\nforce are women and those without a college degree. They are in smaller towns and rural\nareas. The pandemic exacerbated disparities, but it did not create them.\nNearly 52 percent of those out of the labor force are retired; last year, retirees grew by over\n2 million more than what was expected. Nearly 13 percent have a disability. Another 15\npercent identify as caregivers, and 14 percent are students.\nOpting out of work is the right decision for many. Those in school are better preparing\nthemselves in the workforce. Some prefer being home with their kids or their parents.\nOthers are enjoying a well-earned retirement. But it is easy to imagine many could be open\nto working. In fact, almost 6 million of those out of the labor force say they want a job but\njust aren’t looking. If we remove barriers to participation, we may help more people come\no� the sidelines. If about 16 percent returned to the workforce, the United States would be\nback at its peak employment-to-population ratio — 64.7 percent in 2000 (it is 58.7 today).\nThe questions are then, what is keeping folks from working, and what can be done? In my\nconversations, I hear four key barriers to employment: mismatches, family care, health and\nincentives. All these issues existed before the pandemic, but it’s fair to say they have\nintensi�ed in the last 18 months.\nLet’s look at mismatches �rst. There are several types that come up.\nThere’s a skills mismatch. Even prior to the pandemic, we had a shortage of workers with\nthe training and skills necessary to sta� trucking �eets, manufacturing operations, nursing\nshifts, technology companies and construction crews. But now these shortages are ever\nmore acute as demand for these sectors booms.\nThere’s a location mismatch. Jobs are concentrated in cities. But it may not make sense to\nleave a small town to move to a high-cost city. Transportation challenges may keep those\nalready in cities from accessing good jobs. The pandemic has made big cities less attractive\nand challenged urban transportation.\nAnd expectations are becoming an issue, too. Increasingly, we are seeing misalignment\nbetween the jobs available and the jobs workers want. Reservation wages for lower-wage\nand lower-educated workers are up signi�cantly post-pandemic. Potential employees\nexpect higher compensation, bene�ts or workplace �exibility. At the same time, the\npandemic emphasized the downsides of jobs with low pay, poor bene�ts, unpredictable\nschedules, unattractive work environments, in-person work and instability.\nHow do we address these mismatches?\nWe need to fully leverage the skill building capacity of our economy. One natural path is\ncommunity colleges, and their partnerships with local employers. Yet, during the pandemic,\nwe saw enrollment decline. That’s unusual in a recession because workers usually are\n\n\flooking to reskill. Perhaps remote school and child care responsibilities held students back.\nIn response, we are seeing communities invest in whole life support. For example, in\nManassas, Virginia, local leaders used CARES Act funding to o�er eligible city residents up\nto $5,000 for program costs and wraparound services to help them secure retraining.\nWe also need to refocus on K-12. We are now in our third school year impacted by\nCOVID-19. Those most disrupted were children in marginalized communities. Inequities in\neducation feed through to unequal participation in the workplace. We simply have to keep\nschools safe and open and invest in whatever it takes to reduce the learning loss.\nWe need to fully leverage the funding now given to broadband. If the worker can’t get to the\njob, remote work lets the job come to the worker. But it is di�cult to get government funds\ndeployed, and local communities need help. I’ve been intrigued by a program I saw in West\nVirginia providing navigation support for local leaders.\nEmployers can also open the door to a wider talent pool. We are hearing employers\nrevising policies like drug testing, providing more in-house training, and reviewing hiring\ncriteria to ensure relevant prior experience, when appropriate, can be recognized in place\nof a degree. We are also seeing employers reassess their o�erings to tackle the job\nexpectations mismatch. We've seen strong wage increases for entry-level positions,\nbroadened education and child care bene�ts and more and improved �exible working\nconditions.\nSo then let me turn to the second barrier: family care.\nCaretaking has been front and center throughout the pandemic. School closures forced\nsome parents to stay home. Nursing home outbreaks shifted the focus for those with aging\nparents. And all of this came in the middle of child care a�ordability and availability\nchallenges that predated the pandemic and only worsened with lockdowns.\nAs I outlined earlier, we’ve seen some institutions make adjustments in response.\nInstitutions invested in on-site proctoring programs to enable parents to work. Employers\nare implementing new bene�ts like emergency child care. We are also seeing conversations\nopen up about the longer-run challenges in the child care industry, such as labor shortages\nand slim margins despite prices many families can’t a�ord.\nWe can take some inspiration from abroad. While our labor force participation has declined\nover the last 20 years, Canada’s has increased, particularly for women. Research from the\nSan Francisco Fed points to parental leave policies in the two countries as a key\ndi�erentiator. The same research highlights �exible work arrangements as a driver of\nincreased women’s participation in other industrialized countries.\nA third barrier — one that’s been front and center throughout the pandemic — is health.\nMore than 1 in 5 prime-age individuals out of the labor force — those between 25 and 54 —\nreport a disability. And more than one-third of nonworking, nonelderly Medicaid recipients\nreport living with multiple chronic conditions.\n\n\fOf course, the pandemic exacerbated health challenges. Fear of getting the virus may have\nkept some from taking on a part-time service-sector job. Those over 65 were told they were\nat highest risk and should avoid personal interactions. They may also have found remote\ntechnology a challenge. And it didn’t help that the services sector and part-time work o�er\nless access to health insurance than the economy as a whole. Getting the virus under\ncontrol will be a big part of tackling the health barrier in the near term.\nHealth is a particularly important barrier given our aging demographics. Identifying ways to\nkeep Americans healthier longer, or to accommodate older Americans with health concerns\nin workplaces, is a key opportunity area that will grow over time.\nWe again can look abroad for ways to tackle this barrier. Japan has grown the number of\npeople working as its working-age population has shrunk; increased participation among\nolder workers plays a central role. Between 2000 and 2019, the employment-to-population\nratio for Japanese adults ages 60 to 64 increased 19.3 percentage points to 70.3 percent.\nFor context, the U.S. ratio is 56 percent. Japan has funded subsidies for employing older\nworkers and mandated later retirement ages. It has �elded training programs for\nemployers on how to make jobs friendlier for older workers. I should acknowledge that\nJapan has a healthier population. Public health is of course a broader challenge for the\nUnited States.\nThe �nal barrier has also received much attention lately: the potential unintended\nincentives within our bene�ts system. Our bene�ts can provide critical support for people\nin need. But it can also make formal participation in the workforce a costly choice. A small\nboost in earned income can cause an individual to lose meaningful bene�ts. That’s referred\nto as a “bene�ts cli�,” and it can push individuals out of the workforce or toward the\nshadow economy.\nWe see this with health insurance, as people consider jobs that put their kids’ CHIP bene�ts\nat risk. We see it with disability insurance, which makes individuals forfeit lifelong bene�ts\nto engage in the workforce. And we see it in the tax code. We tax the �rst dollar earned by\nthe second earner at the same rate as the last dollar earned by the primary earner.\nCombined with the cost of child care and other work-related expenses, a family’s monthly\ntake-home pay may actually be higher without a second labor market participant.\nI won’t prescribe speci�c policy changes — that's for legislatures — but at the Richmond\nFed, we have invested in distributing a tool that helps organizations understand the\ndynamics of the cli� in their geography. We hope it will help nonpro�ts and employers\nbetter understand how bene�ts impact families’ �nancial calculus.\nOverall, this is a math problem. Over time, we can’t grow without more workers. The best\nsource of more workers is those on the sidelines. And those on the sidelines won’t come\nback to the labor market unless the math makes better sense to them, whether it be child\ncare, bene�ts, compensation, transportation or investment in education. It’s a challenge to\nimprove the real and perceived bene�ts versus the costs of employment, but it is doable, as\n\n\fother countries have shown. That's the task ahead for us, as employers and community\nleaders.\nThis is the civilian noninstitutionalized population, meaning all individuals 16 and older that\nare not in the military or institutionalized.

We have attempted to give guidance on our\npath forward by tying our policies to speci�c outcomes.\nSpeci�cally, we said in September 2020 that we would reinforce our new monetary policy\nframework by keeping rates near zero until “labor market conditions have reached levels\nconsistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and in�ation has\nrisen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.” In\nDecember, we committed to continue asset purchases “until substantial further progress\nhas been made” toward our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\n\fToday, I want to talk about the value of issuing policy guidance tied to outcomes and share\nmy thoughts on how to address the challenges of this approach. I hope this will be of\ninterest to you, as forecasters. Before I dive in, I should note that the views I express are my\nown and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFor much of its history, the Fed was famously tight-lipped about its actions. It’s hard to\nbelieve now, but until 1994, we did not publicly release a policy statement after each\nmeeting. The minutes of FOMC meetings also remained secret until the late 1960s and then\nwere only released with about a 90-day lag. The Fed defended this secrecy for years —\nRichmond’s own Marvin Goodfriend analyzed many of those arguments in a 1985 paper.\nThis opacity led Fed watchers to seek information wherever they could get it, including\nanalyzing the thickness of Alan Greenspan’s briefcase as he headed to FOMC meetings for\nclues about whether the Fed might change policy.\nWe have come a long way since those days. Today, the Fed issues a policy statement\nimmediately after each FOMC meeting, releases the minutes three weeks later, and\nreleases verbatim transcripts after �ve years. This increased transparency is healthy for the\nFed as a public institution, and it was also supported by a growing body of research which\nemphasized the importance of central bank communication and credibility.\nAt �rst, the Fed’s initial steps toward greater transparency involved providing more\ninformation about current monetary policy. But in the early 2000s, the Fed also began to\nprovide information about the likely path of future policy through “forward guidance.” In\n2003, the FOMC voted to reduce the federal funds rate to 1 percent and chose not to go\nany lower. However, the Fed still wanted to provide more accommodation to strengthen\neconomic conditions. As argued in a key paper that same year by Gauti Eggertsson and\nMichael Woodford, central bank communications about the trajectory of future policy\nbecome crucial at the e�ective lower bound (ELB). Such forward guidance can allow the\nFed to in�uence longer-term rates when it has run out of room to reduce short-term rates\nby setting expectations for the likely future path of short-term rates.\nInitially, the Fed’s forward guidance was very general. In its August 2003 policy statement,\nthe FOMC wrote that it believed “policy accommodation can be maintained for a\nconsiderable period.” The following year, when the FOMC was considering raising rates, it\nsignaled that it would be “patient” and that the pace of rate increase was “likely to be\nmeasured.” True to its word, the Fed increased rates gradually between 2004 and 2006 in\nincrements of 25 basis points (although no one would call that pace “gradual” in today’s\neconomic environment).\nDuring the Great Recession, the Fed again employed and continued to evolve its forward\nguidance. At �rst, the FOMC used general language similar to 2003. Then, it introduced\nspeci�c, calendar-based guidance in its August 2011 statement, signaling that it would likely\n\n\fbe necessary to maintain low rates “at least through mid-2013.”\nThe move to calendar-based forward guidance was heavily debated at the time, as the\ntranscripts of the FOMC meetings from that period reveal. Some policymakers felt that a\ncalendar date helped reinforce the Fed’s forecasts for the future path of the economy,\nwhich the FOMC began releasing in the form of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\nearlier that year. But others worried that tying future policy to a date put the Fed in an\nawkward position. If economic conditions didn’t evolve the way policymakers predicted,\nthen they would either have to follow through on a date-based plan that no longer made\nsense or revise the date, diminishing its value as a signal of future behavior. In times of\ngreat uncertainty, that was asking for Fed credibility to be put on the line.\n\nIn December 2012, the FOMC moved from calendar- to outcome-based guidance. It said it\nwould be “appropriate” to keep rates low “at least as long as the unemployment rate\nremains above 6-1/2 percent, in�ation between one and two years ahead is projected to be\nno more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal,\nand longer-term in�ation expectations continue to be well anchored.”\nThis made it clearer that Fed policy would be driven by economic conditions, not dates. This\napproach tried to provide the public with a clearer understanding of how the Fed would\nreact to new data and it gave the Fed greater �exibility in times of heightened uncertainty.\nStill, the transition to outcome-based guidance wasn’t seamless. The formula outlined at\nthat time (like the one we have outlined today) isn’t a simple one. Certainly, those three\ncriteria don’t just roll o� the tongue. It’s also not a precise one as judgment calls are\nrequired. How would the public know if in�ation expectations were no longer well\nanchored?\nAnother potential problem is that the outcomes de�ned could prove wrong if the economy\nshifts. The maximum level of unemployment, for example, moves over time, making it hard\nfor the Fed to provide outcome-based guidance that is appropriate at all circumstances.\nThis means that like dates, the Fed might need to revise its outcomes, leading to similar\ncommunication and credibility challenges. This is one reason why the Fed doesn’t attach a\nspeci�c number to the employment goal in its forward guidance today.\nThe Fed is facing challenges now as it seeks to navigate a highly uncertain recovery from\nthe pandemic. In�ation has been above our long-run 2 percent target for months, but will\nthis run-up in prices be transitory or sustained? Unemployment remains above prepandemic levels, but has the economy changed in ways that have shifted the maximum\nlevel of employment? What does “substantial further progress” look like for a broad-based\nand inclusive metric that has many measures? Should �scal policies not imagined when our\nguidance was de�ned change its terms?\nFinally, it seems clear to me that many audiences �nd outcome-based guidance\nunsatisfying because it cannot provide a de�nitive roadmap of the Fed’s future policy path.\n\n\fTrading instruments are often date-based, so traders would prefer to know exactly when\nmonetary policy is going to change. For reporters and the public they serve, outcome-based\nguidance can seem like inside baseball and is not as easy to process as dates. You as\nforecasters get this, I’m sure.\nI think this has led reporters and market analysts to overemphasize the SEP, particularly\nthe “dot plot” that presents FOMC members’ individual estimates of the appropriate future\npath of policy. The median forecast is often treated as a commitment by the Fed to a\nparticular date-based path. But as Chair Powell has made clear in his press conferences,\nthe SEP is a collection of individual forecasts, not a committee consensus. It can’t be a\nsubstitute for the forward guidance the FOMC presents in its policy statement.\n\nIf the public keeps asking for dates, should the Fed go back to issuing calendar-based\nforward guidance? It’s clear from past experience that this isn’t the optimal path. Markets\nand reporters may want clear dates, but in times of high uncertainty, the Fed can’t credibly\ncommit to guiding policy by dates rather than data.\nSticking with outcome-based guidance, the Fed could try to be more speci�c about its\nthresholds, but past experience also suggests this approach has limitations. It’s harder to\nget alignment among the committee. The higher the level of speci�city, the higher the risk\nthat you’ll bind yourself to a suboptimal path. Surely, there’s some value to leveraging good\njudgment. In addition, some of the Fed’s objectives, like maximum employment, are hard to\nforecast and are in�uenced by factors outside of our control.\nWe could strengthen the connection between the SEP and outcome-based guidance. I like\nthe SEP because it disciplines me to tie my policy prescription to my economic forecast. In\ntimes when forward guidance is a crucial component of Fed communications, I think that\nthrough very carefully. Currently, however, the SEP does not tie economic forecasts to a dot\non the dot plot. Doing so would provide a clearer picture of each FOMC member’s\nindividual reaction function, and taken as a whole, this could help shed more light on the\nFed’s overall reaction function. That said, since the SEP isn’t a committee consensus, we\ncould still run into a problem where the SEP and policy statement send con�icting\nmessages.\nUltimately, I think the most important thing we can do to build con�dence in forward\nguidance is to cleanly execute. In the early 2000s, the Fed signaled that it would follow a\ngradual path for rate lifto� and then did so. The 2013 taper tantrum was an example of\nwhen Fed communications and forward guidance were not so well aligned.\nHopefully, we are executing during the COVID-19 recovery in a way that builds credibility.\nRegarding our guidance on asset purchases:\n• In December, we said we would continue “until substantial further progress has been\nmade toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.”\n\n\f• In July, we said that “the economy has made progress toward these goals.”\n• In September, we said that “if progress continues broadly as expected, the Committee\njudges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted.” That\nis the advance warning we had promised so that no one would be surprised. Hopefully\nit will enable a seamless transition when the time to start tapering comes.\nThat still leaves rate forward guidance, which is explicitly di�erent. We have hit 2 percent\non in�ation, but we still have a lot to learn about whether recent in�ation levels will be\nsustained and how much room we have to run in the labor market until we get to\nmaximum employment. As COVID-19 hopefully eases, I expect the answers to these\nquestions to become clearer.\nCleanly executing communication going forward is my goal. Doing so best cements\noutcome-based guidance as a tool comfortable for us and valuable for the market, for the\npublic, and for you as forecasters.\nThank you to Tim Sablik for assistance preparing these remarks.\nMarvin Goodfriend, “Monetary Mystique: Secrecy and Central Banking,” Federal Reserve Bank\nof Richmond Working Paper No. 85-7, Revised August 1985.\nWilliam T.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nSmall Towns: Making It Work\n\nNext week is the Richmond Fed’s Rural America Week. It’s the third year in a row we’re\nbringing together funders and community organizations, exploring solutions to gaps in\neducational attainment, and sharing some of the many success stories we’ve heard in rural\ncommunities throughout the Richmond Fed’s district.\nThe Richmond Fed has an ongoing commitment to understanding the unique challenges\nand opportunities faced by rural areas. Every month, I visit three to �ve small towns in our\ndistrict (socially distanced) to meet with business and community leaders. While I’ve seen\nsmall towns thriving, it’s safe to say that in general, smaller towns have fallen behind more\nurban areas in recent decades.\nOne measure of this is the employment/population ratio. In the Richmond Fed’s district, the\n\n\femployment/population ratio for people between 16 and 64 years old is almost 11\npercentage points higher in urban areas than in smaller towns. The Fed’s mandate includes\nmaximum employment, so this gap means that understanding and helping small towns\nsucceed is a priority for us.\nWhile every community is di�erent, we’ve identi�ed some common themes in the\nchallenges they face, as shared when I spoke at our �rst annual Investing in Rural America\nConference in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The �rst is education, or providing students with the\ninformation and preparation they need to succeed. The second is connection—facilitating\nworkers’ access to good jobs. Isolation is another challenge, as geographic remoteness can\nlead to informational and institutional gaps. Finally, many people in smaller towns face\nobstacles to labor force participation, such as health problems. And of course, COVID-19\nhas exacerbated many of these challenges over the past year and a half. Remote education\nhas widened preexisting gaps. Community college enrollment has declined. Broadband has\nbecome even more critical. Both mental and physical health have been issues.\nHow do we address these challenges? Sometimes the best place to start is looking at who is\ngetting it right. So let me put forward some of the innovative strategies I’ve encountered\nthroughout our district.\n\nI’ll start with education, which builds the foundation for economic growth in a community.\nEducated workers attract new businesses, and good schools attract new residents. I should\nnote that while there is an overall education gap, there are many smaller towns with highperforming educational systems. The public school system in Wise, Virginia, for example,\nhas been in the top tier of Virginia schools for years.\nBut I have kept my eyes open for interesting stories of transformation and improvement.\nAnd while improving educational outcomes is a challenging task, some communities have\nmade a real di�erence. Danville, Virginia, for example, has made big investments in early\nchildhood education that have led to large increases in kindergarten readiness. In\nLexington Park, Maryland, which is home to the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, leaders at\nthe base have collaborated with business and community leaders to make major\nimprovements in K-12 education.\n\nEducation is just the �rst step. When I was in Fayetteville, North Carolina, someone\nremarked that their “biggest export is educated kids.” How do you ensure that there are\nopportunities worth staying in town for?\nA lot of communities focus on recruiting major company operations. Of course, if one can\nattract the right stable employer that can be of help. But recruitment is a hard game to win.\nSo, many communities have put their e�orts into better connecting their workforce to jobs\nthat already exist. That’s particularly helpful in today’s tight labor market. Here there’s an\nimportant role for community colleges, and we have some great examples in our district of\n\n\fschools and businesses partnering to train and connect residents to job opportunities.\nIn Hickory, North Carolina, the Catawba Valley Furniture Academy at Catawba Valley\nCommunity College is a training program designed by local furniture manufacturers to train\nstudents for skilled positions. Pitt Community College in Greenville, North Carolina, works\nclosely with pharmaceutical manufacturers in the region to train workers for their growing\nindustry. Procter & Gamble partnered with Blue Ridge Community and Technical College in\nMartinsburg, West Virginia, to train workers for its Tabler Station plant. And in Lake City,\nSouth Carolina, the Florence-Darlington Technical College has partnered with the Darla\nMoore Foundation and Francis Marion University to create a regional center (the\nContinuum) to train people for high-quality jobs. Manassas, Virginia, is using CARES Act\nmoney to fund a training program that o�ers eligible city residents up to $5,000 for\nprogram costs and wraparound services to help them secure retraining. And Virginia is\nusing CARES Act funding to provide scholarships for workers displaced by the pandemic.\nNot all training has to be provided by schools. The Carolina Textile District, for example,\npart of the Industrial Commons based in Morganton, North Carolina, o�ers workshops to\ntrain people for the resurgent �eld of industrial sewing. It also o�ers classes to help people\nstart and scale their own textile �rms, which brings me to my next point: It’s not just about\nattracting existing employers. It’s also about giving people the tools to become employers\nthemselves. We’ve visited multiple communities in West Virginia that are doing great jobs\nfostering entrepreneurship.\nIn Beckley, West Virginia, the West Virginia Hive provides aspiring or current business\nowners with technical assistance, networking, and business advising. In Taylor County, West\nVirginia, nearly one-third of the job growth since the Great Recession is accounted for by\nself-employment. Over the past �ve years, Taylor County has seen 27 percent growth in\nnew businesses, the second-fastest growth in the state. That is 221 new businesses in a\ncounty of just under 17,000 people. They’ve achieved this by creating a local network of\ncommitted residents who met weekly to share ideas, make plans and reinvigorate their\ncommunity. That created an environment where people were striving for more and were\nmore able and willing to take risks—and helped one of the county’s towns be selected for\nthe Energizing Entrepreneurial Communities Program (E-Communities).\nIt doesn’t stop with the jobs. Workers need places to live and they need transportation—so\ncommunities working to boost employment also need to look around the corner and\nanticipate the needs of the people they’re hoping to attract and retain.\nWe’re hearing a lot about housing challenges in the current environment of low supply and\nescalating costs. Here, there is a vital role for community foundations and rural community\ndevelopment �nancial institutions (CDFIs). For example, Woodlands, headquartered in\nElkins, West Virginia, has played a crucial role in revitalizing downtowns and building\nattractive, a�ordable housing, such as the Golden Rule in Belington. This former store and\nwarehouse, built in 1902, now features a�ordable apartments, an artist market and an\noutdoor community space.\n\n\fOften in more rural areas, people have to travel long distances between home and work. So\nin South Carolina, the Palmetto Breeze transit system helps people get from their inland\nhomes to jobs on the coast. In Lynchburg, Virginia, the HumanKind nonpro�t organization\nhas been a partner in the national Ways to Work program for more than 20 years, serving\nover 18,343 families in the Lynchburg region with over $6.3 million in auto loans. This\nunique program provides nonpredatory, a�ordable auto �nancing, �nancial coaching and\nvehicle maintenance education to enable working families to get access to the\ntransportation they need.\n\nUnderpinning the challenges related to education and employment is isolation. The most\nobvious example is lack of broadband access. Broadband removes the obstacle of distance,\nopening up a wealth of educational resources and health care options, and giving\nentrepreneurs access to new markets. Small towns face challenges in funding and in\n�nding providers.\nOne promising avenue is leveraging rural electrical cooperatives, which serve many of the\nsame areas that lack broadband access. Choptank Electrical Cooperative on Maryland’s\nEastern Shore, for example, formed a broadband subsidiary last year and connected its\n�rst customer in April of this year. Communities also need help accessing available funding.\nIn West Virginia, communities are working with the Claude Worthington Benedum\nFoundation and Generation West Virginia to help them navigate various broadband funding\nsources, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Communications\nCommission, the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the Appalachian\nRegional Commission.\nBreaking down isolation is also about human connection: role models and mentors who\ncan show small town residents a path to a better future. In Maryland, the Garrett County\nCommunity Action Committee’s “2Gen approach” promotes family economic security by\nproviding coaching, �nancial education, and job search support for parents, and highquality early childhood services. The Roanoke Valley’s Total Action for Progress (TAP)\ncommunity action agency in Virginia also serves the entire family to make a sustainable\nimpact on poverty. The College Advising Corps, based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, places\nadvisers in high schools to provide personalized college guidance to students from\ndisadvantaged backgrounds. In addition to helping students navigate the application and\nenrollment process, advisers also help students and their families see college as an option\nin the �rst place.\n\nMany people in small towns also face obstacles to labor force participation such as health\nconcerns or the potential loss of needed safety-net programs. There are promising\nprograms to help people recovering from substance abuse return to work, such as West\nVirginia University’s “West Virginia Inspiring Hope” program. This initiative creates an entire\n\n\frecovery-to-work ecosystem of job training and placement, treatment, housing, and\ntransportation. The Williamson Health and Wellness Center, in Mingo County, West Virginia,\ntakes a holistic approach to helping residents with chronic health problems such as\ndiabetes, obesity and addiction—and has become a driving force behind the community’s\nrevitalization.\nThere’s been a lot of talk recently about bene�ts programs potentially creating a\ndisincentive to work. The Richmond Fed is working with employers, policymakers, and\nnonpro�ts throughout our region to help them identify and plan around “bene�ts cli�s”\n(using the CLIFF tool developed by Atlanta Fed) —situations where an increase in income\nfor low-income individuals and families actually makes them worse o�, because their\nearnings rise by enough to render them ineligible for the public bene�ts that they were\npreviously receiving, but not by enough to a�ord them what the bene�ts would have\notherwise provided.\n\nIt’s not enough to have a single program or initiative. The places that are making it work\nalso have several key elements in common: a sense of place, regional cooperation,\ndedicated funding, and, harder to de�ne—what I like to call scrappiness.\nTowns need a story: a reason to visit and a reason to stay; a sense of place to rally around.\nThe story is for employers, and the story is for talent. But, importantly, the story is less\nabout marketing the plan to outsiders and more about marketing it to those who live there\n—why one should come and why one should stay.\nThis is a relatively easy task for beach towns and college towns—but many places also have\nnatural resources to take advantage of. In Fayetteville, West Virginia, a thriving\noutdoorsports industry has helped rejuvenate the area. A robust all-terrain vehicle trail\nsystem draws visitors to Gilbert, West Virginia. Danville, Virginia, has capitalized on its\nriverfront and New Bern, North Carolina, on its thriving waterfront district.\nOther towns could build on history, as Cambridge, Maryland, is doing by honoring Harriet\nTubman and by capitalizing on its rich maritime history. Abingdon, Virginia, has a revitalized\ndowntown that dates back to the Revolutionary War (along with a thriving theater\nprogram). I could keep listing examples— the arts scene in Lake City, South Carolina; the\n“walking mall” in Winchester, Virginia.; the vibrant downtown in Aiken, South Carolina ; the\nlively retail district in Leonardtown, Maryland —but the common thread is that these\ncommunities all believe in what they have to o�er and are committed to making others\nbelieve too.\nRegional collaboration also is key. Almost by de�nition, small towns are surrounded by\nother small towns, and the strategy for that region needs to be integrated across\njurisdictions. Together, small towns are more attractive to funders. They need to speak with\none voice and operate together, whether it’s on education, business recruitment or housing\ndevelopment. Similarly, a nearby bigger city isn’t a problem but a bene�t, as proximity to\n\n\famenities and transportation can enhance the story. The path to success isn’t going it\nalone; instead, it’s working together. The GO Virginia initiative is pushing that sort of\nregional cooperation, leveraging state funding.\nOf course, everything I’ve talked about requires money. Funding can come from a lot of\nplaces. Some communities are fortunate to have a local philanthropist or corporate\nbenefactor. But not every town has that option.\nSome places have gotten creative — Danville and Martinsville, Virginia, and Asheville, North\nCarolina, used the sales of local hospitals to endow regional foundations that invest in\nhealth, education and workforce programs. In Hagerstown, Maryland, a local business\nassociation worked with a state senator to secure legislation to issue bonds to fund a new\nbaseball stadium, which is in turn supporting downtown revitalization.\nAnd the COVID-19 stimulus money is a huge opportunity. It has made billions available to\nfund infrastructure and broadband investments. Even more is potentially available to\nsupport child care, early education and community colleges.\nThe challenge for small towns now is local capacity. Government institutions are slow to\nrelease money, and they tend to distribute it to places with a proven track record, access to\nmatching funds and a well-written plan for using the money. Some communities have built\nthat grantwriting and funding capacity, but most have not. We have seen this issue starkly\nwith broadband funding in our broadband summit this summer that highlighted the\nimportance of capacity building and public-private partnerships.\nBringing all these pieces together—building a sense of place, collaborating with neighbors\nand being opportunistic about funding—requires what I heard one community leader\ndescribe as “scrappiness.” It’s a hard thing to de�ne, but we know it when we see it: a mix of\ndetermination, optimism and creativity that sets some places apart. Every town I’ve\nmentioned has scrappy local leaders who just won’t give up.\nAs we’ll see during Rural America Week, and continue to share in our Rural Spotlight series,\nthere are small towns throughout our district that have found creative ways to evolve and\nthrive. And next March, we’ll be hosting our fourth conference devoted to the challenges\nand opportunities of the small towns in our district and beyond. We’ll be talking in more\ndepth about the issues highlighted in this essay—capacity building, barriers to workforce\nparticipation and digital inclusion, to name a few. Keep an eye on our website for more\ninformation, and we hope to see you there.\n\nSmall Town and Rural Communities\n\nBroadband\n\n\fReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nThe labor market story this summer has been employers’ struggle to �nd workers. Job\nopenings are at a record level. And while 5.6 million fewer people are employed today than\nbefore the pandemic, there don’t seem to be enough people looking for work to �ll the\navailable openings. Labor force participation is down, and reservation wages are up.\nBut hiring is not employers’ only challenge. In what some are calling the “Great\nResignation,” employers are also struggling to retain workers. In April, the quits rate —\nquits as a percent of total employment — hit a record high of 2.8 percent. In July, the rate\nwas only slightly lower at 2.7 percent.\nSo far, these hiring and retention issues seem most concentrated in lower-paying jobs.\nRecent increases in wage growth among the lowest quartile of wage earners and lower-skill\nworkers — increases that outpace other workers’ — re�ect employer challenges in\nrecruiting and retaining these workers.\nOver the coming months, with enhanced unemployment insurance ending, schools\nreopening, and virus fears — hopefully — waning, we have been anticipating labor supply\nand demand to better balance. But contacts across the Richmond Fed’s district do not seem\ncon�dent that we are near the end of the retention challenge, which in turn will further\npressure hiring. They’re preparing for further churn on the horizon — and this time, they\nexpect it to extend further into professional and managerial roles, where quit rates have\nnot yet been as elevated.\nA few signs point to continued and perhaps, more broad-based, pressure on quits.\nThe quits rate re�ects con�dence in the labor market. The Conference Board’s labor market\ndi�erential — the di�erence between those who think jobs are plentiful versus hard to get\n— reached the highest reading (44.1 percent) in July since 2000. And this con�dence can be\ncontagious. As co-workers leave for other jobs, workers may become more aware of the\nopportunities they’re missing. And as new hires onboard with higher wages, current\nemployees may consider a change to secure a higher salary.\n\n\fThere may also be a backlog of quits. Many workers hung onto their jobs over the past year\nand a half, waiting to make a move until the pandemic ended. Some may have been\nmotivated by a desire to avoid further instability in an already unstable period. Others may\nhave wished to avoid a fully remote onboarding experience. We may see some of this\nbacklog clear over the next several months.\nSome of those who stayed in their jobs have had to bear excess workloads as �rms have\noperated short-sta�ed. This issue is most visible in restaurants as managers beg for\npatience with stretched-too-thin sta�. But it’s not only an issue in service-sector jobs.\nAnalysts who had to work long hours when the strong rebound caught employers who’d\nslowed hiring o�-guard may also be ready to seek a better balance.\nThe reassessment of life and career choices that we have been hearing so much about may\nalso keep quits elevated in the coming months. Twenty-two percent of American workers —\nand 30 percent of those younger than 40 — have considered changing their occupation or\n�eld of work since the pandemic began, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll\nfrom July.\nAnd the return to o�ce could expose new mismatches between employers and employees.\nSome workers who want to work remotely may �nd policies mandating a return to in\nperson. A recent survey found that 17 percent of those working remotely during the\npandemic would consider looking for another job if required to return. Others who are\nexcited to return to the workplace may �nd their o�ces moving to remote. Those who\nmoved to a new location during the pandemic may �nd even hybrid work impractical.\nVaccine mandates may play a role too. People who won’t get vaccinated will �nd\nthemselves required to �nd a new job; others may seek out a new employer that is willing\nto provide that guarantee.\nWhat are the implications of the quits rate remaining elevated and potentially spreading\nfurther into professional and managerial roles? Employers, including those who have thus\nfar been relatively immune, will want to prioritize investments that strengthen employees’\nconnections to the �rm, its culture, and each other to minimize the risk of seeing their own\nwave of resignations.\nFor the economy as a whole, it could mean in�ationary and productivity pressures.\nA higher job switching rate suggests higher future wage growth. Workers switching jobs\ntend to command a wage premium. For example, job switchers saw 4.1 percent median\nwage growth in August, while job stayers saw a more modest 3.1 percent. Over time, even\njob stayers can see wage growth as employers become more concerned about attrition.\nTo maintain margins, employers turn to productivity improvements and price hikes.\nWe have seen this at lower levels of pay. For example, the adoption of QR code ordering\nsystems has enabled restaurants to reduce demands on sta�ng while CPI prices for\nrestaurants have increased to levels not seen since the 1980s.\n\n\fThus far, wage pressure seems to be concentrated in lower levels of pay. But increased\nchurn among higher-paid workers could spark wage pressure in higher levels too. Pressure\nacross the wage ladder would mean higher wage bills for employers which could lead them\nto pursue additional, perhaps larger, changes. And what does that potential for higher\nlabor costs, productivity investments and price hikes mean? It means those of us paying\nclose attention to our economic potential and in�ation need to watch who’s leaving jobs as\nclosely as we watch who’s taking them.\nLevanon, Gad, and Frank Steemers, \"Why Wages Are Growing Rapidly Now—And Will\nContinue to in the Future.\" The Conference Board, August 20, 2021.\n\"Wage Growth Tracker.\" Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, August 2021.\nLong, Heather, and Scott Clement. “Nearly a third of U.S. workers under 40 considered\nchanging careers during the pandemic.” The Washington Post, Aug. 16, 2021.\nOzimek, Adam. “The Great Resignation: From Full-Time to Freelance.” Upwork.\nBirinci, Serdar. “Job Switching Rates during a Recession.” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,\nAug. 19, 2021.\n\"Wage Growth Tracker.” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, August 2021.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nLearn more about labor market trends in the latest Macro Minute blog post, which\nasks if people are reconsidering the tradeo� between labor and leisure.\n\n\fReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nAn economic recovery has the potential to de�ne the labor market for years. It can shut\nworkers out, leaving them on the sidelines while the labor market heals without them, or it\ncan bring them in, ultimately boosting long-term economic growth.\nFollowing the Great Recession, we saw the great majority of jobs go to college graduates.\nCollege graduates made up less than 40 percent of the workforce between 2010 and 2016,\nbut as many as 8.4 million jobs of the 11.6 million jobs created during that time went to\nthose with a college degree.\nThe skewed nature of the recovery re�ected how di�erent industries fared. For example,\nthe recession pummeled manufacturing and jobs in that industry, and the less-educated\nworkers who �lled them were left behind. However, it also re�ected an ongoing shift in\nemployer expectations. Jobs that had previously been available to those without a college\neducation increasingly required a degree. For example, in 2014, more than 60 percent of\njob postings for supervisors of production and operation workers required a college\ndegree, while fewer than 20 percent of workers in those positions held degrees.\nWhy did employers expect more from candidates?\nEven prior to the recession, employers were losing con�dence in the quality of non-degree\ncandidates, perhaps because of increased complexity in the skills required to successfully\nexecute tasks in a world of technological innovation.\nBut labor market dynamics also played a role. Labor supply outweighed labor demand,\nmeaning employers could be pickier and recruit more quali�ed workers. Unemployment\namong the college educated was elevated. Even in jobs that typically did not require a\ncollege degree, employers had the ability to select candidates with more formal education.\nUnderemployment among recent college graduates increased about 15 percent (from 40.6\npercent to 46.6 percent) between January 2008 and 2012.\nYears into the economic expansion, as the available talent pool shrank, we saw some\n\n\femployers start to widen their search parameters. In the tech space, for example, we saw\ncompanies such as Google, Apple, and IBM emphasize openness to and new pathways for\nnon-degree holders. But for many employers, degree requirements remain. Hiring\nprocesses likely play a role. Automated resume screens, for example, mean candidates who\ndo not meet basic requirements, such as a bachelor’s degree, can get �ltered out before a\nhuman ever sees their resume.\nThe COVID-19 recession had the potential to cause a repeat of what we saw a decade ago.\nWith so much job loss and rapid technology adoption in the face of lockdowns and social\ndistancing, the conditions seemed ripe for employers to raise their expectations and be\nchoosier with job candidates.\nBut this time, labor market dynamics have shifted. Labor demand is strong, with the\nnumber of job openings already surpassing pre-pandemic levels. This time, it is labor\nsupply that seems suppressed. Even though there are millions more people without jobs\nthan before the pandemic, the number of unemployed individuals per job opening has\nfallen below one. There are more openings than people looking for work.\nEmployers likely won’t be able to �ll vacancies by recruiting overquali�ed candidates.\nCollege-educated workers saw less severe job loss than lower-educated workers — thanks\nto remote work — and they have now recovered to their February 2020 employment levels.\nMore important, that recovery does not seem to be predicated on graduates accepting jobs\nfor which they are overquali�ed; the share of recent graduates who are underemployed is\nbelow February 2020 levels.\nThat leaves employers looking for ways to recruit workers with less formal education. But\nthis group isn’t an easy hire either. The Great Recession led employers to raise their\nexpectations; the dynamics in the COVID-19 recovery have led workers to raise theirs. It is\nnow workers holding out for a better match. The reservation wage for workers with less\nthan a college degree has increased 26 percent since March 2020.\nEmployers are already responding to these expectations with wage increases. In 2021,\nworkers with a high school education or less have seen stronger wage growth than collegeeducated workers.\nIt is possible that the start of the school year and the end of enhanced unemployment\nbene�ts will naturally bring people back into the labor force. But if they don’t return, then\nemployers may need to change their recruitment strategy to widen their eligible candidate\npool and pull in workers from the sidelines. Those changes could de�ne our labor market\nfor years to come.\nEmployers may open roles to job candidates that previously lacked necessary credentials.\nCVS announced in early August that they would be dropping their requirement for a high\nschool diploma or GED diploma for entry-level roles. Similarly, a big transportation\ncompany recently replaced its base education requirement with basic skills requirements,\nas pro�led in a recent piece published by the Atlanta Fed.\n\n\fEmployers may revisit policies that by nature shrink the eligible candidate pool, such as\ndrug testing or background check policies. In a recent survey of 40 manufacturers, labor\nand employment law �rm Ogletree Deakins’ Manufacturing Industry Group found that 37\npercent have stopped screening for marijuana in preemployment drug tests, and 32\npercent narrowed their de�nition of a disqualifying conviction.\nEmployers may provide their own training to candidates who otherwise would be\nunquali�ed. Food distributor Sysco recently announced a driver training school to help\ntackle the shortage of drivers. They pay trainees to complete the training, cover their\nlicensing and certi�cation fees, and recruit current warehouse associates to join the\npipeline. Employers may alternatively build their workforce through partnerships with\ncommunity colleges.\nEmployers may invest in work enablers, such as child or elder care support, to help recruit\ncandidates who are quali�ed for a position but unable to pursue it. McDonald’s, for\nexample, recently introduced a pilot for an emergency child care program. And it’s not\nalone. At least 75 companies have started o�ering similar bene�ts through Bright Horizons\nFamily Solutions (an employer-based child care company) this year, according to the\ncompany.\nComing out of the Great Recession, we saw labor market dynamics have a lasting impact.\nEmployers’ expectations of who and how they recruit became engrained in hiring\nprocesses. Coming out of the COVID-19 recession, we could see labor market pressures\nlead employers to open doors to new populations — which would be good news for our\nfuture workforce and economy. If that happens, then what has started out as yet another\ndivided recovery has the potential to leave behind an entirely di�erent legacy.\nCarnevale, Anthony P., Tamara Jayasundera, and Artem Gulish. “America’s Divided Recovery:\nCollege Haves and Have-Nots.” Georgetown University Center on Education and the\nWorkforce, 2016.\n“Moving the Goalposts: How Demand for a Bachelor’s Degree is Reshaping the Workforce.”\nBurning Glass Technologies, September 2014.\nFuller, Joseph B., and Manjari Raman. “Dismissed by Degrees: How Degree In�ation Is\nUndermining U.S. Competitiveness and Hurting America’s Middle Class.” Harvard Business\nSchool, October 2017.\nUnderemployment Rates for College Graduates, Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nUnderemployment rate is de�ned as the share of graduates working in jobs that typically do\nnot require a college degree.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nJob openings reached 9.2 million in May, the highest level in the 20-year-plus history of the\ndata. We hear businesses are struggling to �ll those openings, and the issue is particularly\nacute for low-wage positions. This di�culty is, of course, strange given there are still over 7\nmillion fewer people employed today than in February 2020.\nOur contacts o�er a variety of reasons why labor supply might lag demand. Some point to a\ncontinued fear of infection or logistical barriers related to remote schooling or child care.\nOthers point toward increased retirements or the adverse incentives created by enhanced\nunemployment insurance. Still others believe workers have reassessed their perspectives\non work versus time at home.\nEconomics has an explanation for this: an increase in the “reservation wage.” The\nreservation wage is the lowest wage an unemployed person is willing to accept for a new\njob. If an individual’s reservation wage rises above an employer’s o�ered wage, then the\nindividual will likely keep looking for another opportunity, or even opt out of the labor\nforce.\nWe have data to validate that reservation wages have increased over the past year,\nespecially for individuals making less than $60,000 per year and those without college\ndegrees. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York conducts a regular survey that asks\nrespondents for the lowest wage they would be willing to accept for a new job. Between\nMarch 2020 and March 2021, the average reservation wage for those making less than\n$60,000 and those without college degrees went up more than $10,000\n(up 26 percent). This increase is far in excess of the range that survey has seen historically\nfor these groups.\nIn comparison, the average reservation wages of those making more than $60,000 and\nthose with college degrees only increased about 3 percent and 6 percent, respectively,\nduring the same time period. What spurred this increase in reservation wages?\nPart of the answer may be the impact of the pandemic experience. Increased health\n\n\for child care concerns or better understanding the pain of a commute might elevate\nthe costs that individuals associate with a job. At the same time, enhanced unemployment\ninsurance might make staying unemployed more feasible. Bolstered savings might reduce\nthe sense of urgency.\nAnother force seems to be playing a role: the dialogue around a $15 minimum wage. To be\nclear, e�orts to increase the minimum wage have existed for years. But the outpouring of\ngratitude for essential workers, support for stimulus to jump-start the economy and a new\nCongress gave that movement renewed energy this spring. Congress didn’t pass a new bill,\nbut there are signs that $15 has become a wage anchor point.\nFor one, several states and cities are moving toward $15 without waiting for federal change.\nPre-pandemic, seven states and the District of Columbia had committed to reach $15 over\ntime. Last year, Florida joined this list, representing a broadening consensus beyond\ntraditional progressive states and localities.\nIn addition, the private sector increasingly seems to be adopting a similar message. In the\nlast few months, a number of large employers, such as Southwest Airlines and\nUnder Armour, have announced bumps in entry level wages to $15. In perhaps the\nstrongest evidence of the importance of the “$15 anchor,” several others, like Chipotle and\nMcDonald’s, have announced an average $15 starting wage. Presumably, those �rms see an\nadvantage to adopting the number in messaging even if they do not adopt the wage �oor.\nThis combination of private and public momentum could be boosting workers'\nexpectations, which in turn raises their reservation wages. Google searches\nfor “$15 minimum wage” reached their all-time high in the �rst quarter. And higher worker\nexpectations could be pushing employers to raise wages, further cementing the higher\nwage �oor.\nWhether due to pandemic factors or expectation shifts, economic theory gives us a pretty\ngood idea of the implications of a reservation wage increase. If fewer jobs meet\nindividuals’ standards, then fewer people enter or remain in the workforce. If there\nare fewer people in the workforce, employers must raise wages or lower their dependency\non labor. If employers raise wages, they likely pass on part of the increased labor cost to\nconsumers via higher prices. If they lower their dependency on labor instead, they turn to\nautomation or o�shoring, or make adjustments to the quantity or quality of their products.\nWe already see this theory happening around us. As I discussed in an essay last month, we\nsee wages for lower-skilled workers rising as workforce participation stays stubbornly low.\nWe also see price increases. While other factors, such as supply bottlenecks, are\ncontributing to in�ationary pressures, businesses also point to wage pressure. For\nexample, Chipotle linked its latest price hike to wage increases.\nAnd in sectors struggling to �nd labor, �rms are �nding ways to reduce their reliance\non workers: turning to automation, o�oading tasks to customers or third parties, reducing\nthe frequency of service or sacri�cing quality. If you have taken a trip this summer, you\n\n\fhave experienced this. Perhaps your airline rescheduled your �ight. Perhaps you waited\nlonger to be served at dinner or ordered your meal through a QR code menu. Perhaps your\nhotel stay came without daily housekeeping.\nIt is too early to tell whether this increase in reservation wages is temporary or permanent.\nIf labor supply gets a boost over the next few months, as vaccines help put the virus behind\nus, enhanced unemployment ceases and schools reopen, then wage and price pressures\nshould ease, and the incentive to reduce labor should weaken. We will see.\nOne area to watch in the near term is how employment evolves in states that are ending\nenhanced unemployment insurance early. I am paying close attention to real-time data on\njob search activity.\nIn the longer term, there are a few other areas worth watching.\nHow durable is the expectation of a $15 minimum wage? While current expectations might\nact as an e�ective anchor, this could be less durable than a minimum wage codi�ed in law.\nIt is possible that a negative labor demand shock in the future could lead to lower wages in\na way that would not be likely with an o�cial wage �oor.\nHow will businesses’ compensation strategy shift? We may see employers tweak the\nbalance between wages and bene�ts in response to the higher reservation wage. Some\nmay move toward higher wages and away from fringe perks to present an o�er that meets\nworkers’ mental model of what wages should be. Others may try to better communicate\nthe monetary value of their fringe bene�ts, as happens with cafeteria plans that place an\nexplicit �nancial value on a bene�ts package.\nWhat will be the impact on wages more broadly? Higher entry wages compress pay scales\nof current workers who often respond with demands for higher compensation for\nthemselves. The broader the reverberations, the greater the resulting pay and price\npressure.\nThe fall will bring much change: Schools will reopen, employees will return to o�ces and\ngovernment assistance will decline. We’ll be keeping our eyes on the impact of these\nmultiple factors on the reservation wage, and in turn the economy.\nPissarides, Christopher A (2nd ed.), “Equilibrium Unemployment Theory.: 2nd Edition.”\nCambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2000.\n\n\fEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nThe following text is a lightly edited version of remarks delivered at the Raleigh Chamber\nPartners Forum on June 24, 2021.\nA little over a year ago, we shut down the U.S. economy to slow the spread of COVID-19. It\nwas a painful, di�cult process, and thankfully, we seem to be on the other side. But it turns\nout that reopening our economy isn’t easy either. Who would have thought that the same\nauto plants that went idle last March would once again be closed — this time because of a\nchip shortage? Who could have imagined �ying somewhere but not being able to �nd a\nrental car when you land? And who would have expected hotels, restaurants and theme\nparks to be paring back their menus and hours just when consumers are ready to travel\nand eat out again?\nWe are seeing elevated net worth — from �scal stimulus, quarantine-suppressed spending\nand rising asset prices — funding pent-up demand from consumers exhausted from\nisolation and freed by vaccines and warmer weather.\nThat demand is outpacing supply. Inventories are low. Ships have been backlogged at West\nCoast ports. The ice storm in Texas disrupted chemical manufacturers. Chip shortages are\nlimiting auto production. The inventory of houses for sale is historically low. Manufacturers\nwho got behind during the downturn have struggled to catch up.\nMany �rms are also constrained by an inability to �nd workers. The jobs opening rate is the\nhighest it’s been in the 20-plus years of that data series. But at the same time, strangely, the\nunemployment rate is still elevated at 5.9 percent, and 7.1 million fewer people are\nemployed than before the pandemic. What’s the story here? In part, we’re seeing a drop in\nlabor force participation driven by parents with elevated care responsibilities and a surge of\nretirements. In addition, stimulus payments and a year of reduced spending might have\ngiven workers the �nancial wherewithal to be more selective about pay, working conditions\nor health risks. We might also be seeing regional, sector or skill mismatch between the\npeople looking for work and the open jobs. These labor constraints are particularly notable\n\n\fat lower wage levels.\nBasic economics teaches that strong demand plus limited supply equals higher prices. And\nit has. In May, 12-month headline PCE rose at a 3.9 percent annual rate. The 12-month core\nPCE, which strips out more volatile food and energy prices, rose at a 3.4 percent annual\nrate. And fast-growing prices are making up a larger share of overall spending — in May,\nprices went up more than 10 percent for nearly 18 percent of the items in an in�ation\nmeasure produced by the Dallas Fed.\nSo the topic on many people’s minds is in�ation. And why wouldn’t it be? We’ve got high\nreported data, spiking commodity prices, trillions in �scal spending, signi�cant Fed asset\npurchases, rates at zero, unexpected supply chain outages at a time of severe pent-up\ndemand, a depreciating dollar, short labor supply and a daily media drumbeat about higher\nprices.\nBut how concerned should we be? I’ll note that the word “in�ation” conjures up di�erent\nthings for di�erent people. Businesses, conscious of their tight margins, focus on input\nprices, which have soared; central banks pay attention to changes in the overall price level,\nwhich have been moderate until just recently. Consumers feel in�ation when food and gas\nprices rise, yet their volatility takes them out of our core metrics. Businesses focus on today\nand the customer resistance they face when they raise prices; central bankers focus more\non tomorrow and what expectations are for prices down the road. And market measures of\nlonger-term in�ation compensation, like the TIPS indices, have stayed steady as the recent\ndata has come in, at e�ectively the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nDuring a recent discussion, one of the economists on my team posed the question, “What\ndecade are we in?” How you answer that question informs what you think we will see in the\ncoming years and the optimal path forward for policy.\nYou might think we’re in the 1970s: a period of high in�ation that didn’t end until the\nVolcker interest rate increases of the early 1980s. For sure, in�ation has increased recently,\nand we even saw gas lines last month. But it’s hard to ignore how much of the current rise\nin in�ation is due to temporary factors. Used car price increases were a third of last\nmonth’s increase. Return –to normal prices in the travel industry were another big factor,\nas were supply chain challenges across the spectrum. You have to imagine many of these\nincreases will ease and that we may even see price reversals — daily car rental rates won’t\nbe $400 forever because more supply will come online. A great cure for high prices is, well,\nhigh prices.\nYou might think we’re in the 2000s, when — after a period of low rates — in�ation\nincreased and the equity and housing markets exploded before collapsing and causing the\nGreat Recession. For sure, valuations are up, housing sales are frenzied and price increases\nare at September 2008 levels. But it’s hard to ignore how much more stable the �nancial\nsystem has become, with less leverage in the housing market and in the banking system.\nBank risk weighted capital ratios are at a record high 14.3 percent today, compared with 9.8\n\n\fpercent in the third quarter of 2008.\nYou might think we’re in the 2010s, when many people feared the Fed’s low rates and asset\npurchases would lead to in�ation, but that fear never really materialized. PCE in�ation did\nincrease somewhat to 2.5 percent in 2011, but it reverted once temporary pressures\nsubsided and then remained below 2 percent for many years. That path could well repeat\nitself. Of course, it’s hard to ignore the long list of present-day in�ationary events I\ndescribed earlier; presumably they will have some impact on in�ation expectations.\nOr you might think we’re in the mid-1960s: when in�ation started its acceleration after\nalmost two decades of stability. Perhaps you see a risk that in�ation expectations once\nagain become unanchored, given the similarities of sizable �scal de�cits and\naccommodative monetary policy. But while one should never say never, it’s hard to ignore\nthe number of other factors that led to the Great In�ation, including no longer pegging the\ndollar to the price of gold, the rise of OPEC and wage and price controls — as well as the\nlockstep compensation and price environment of the time given pattern bargaining and\nregulated industries. And today’s Fed has learned the lessons of that era.\nThe decade game is a fun one. Maybe you think automation will cause a productivity boom\nlike the one that limited in�ation in the 1990s, or that we will have a short but steep\nin�ationary cycle like we saw as the economy adjusted at the end of World War II. Or maybe\nyou look at all this excess savings and want to imagine a return to the Roaring ‘20s.\nFor me, all I can say is that every decade is unique. I do believe we are in the middle of a\ntemporary adjustment cycle, during which workers will return to the workplace as schools\nopen and �scal payments expire, and suppliers will catch up to demand. For those reasons,\nI expect our near-term in�ationary pressure to ease as we go into the fourth quarter.\nThe key question, then, will be whether this episode has a signi�cant lingering e�ect on\nbusinesses and consumers. Will they accept higher annual price increases going forward? I\nthink the past 30 years of relative price stability must outweigh a few months of pressure.\nBut one can never be too careful. That’s why you see the Fed starting our process of\ndiscussing normalization, and hopefully why you hear legislators talking about how they will\npay for their proposed spending packages.\nHistory doesn’t repeat itself, but they say it can rhyme. So I’m hoping for a 1940s-era\ntemporary price adjustment process, followed by a return to the growth and price stability\nwe experienced during the 1950s and mid-1960s. But every decade has its story, and we\nwill soon see what is ours.\n\n\fEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nIn�ation\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nVirtual Presentation to Regional Hispanic Chambers of Commerce\n\nGracias por haberme invitado a venir aquí con ustedes el día de hoy, y extiendo mi\nagradecimiento especial a la Cámara Hispana de Maryland por organizar este evento. Es la\nprimera vez que estas 5 cámaras se han reunido, y espero que esto sea el inicio de una\nnueva tradición. Tenemos tanto que aprender unos de otros, y sé que las conversaciones\ndel día de hoy inspirarán nuevas ideas para todos nosotros.\nAntes de entrar en detalles, debo señalar que las opiniones que expreso son las mías\npropias y no necesariamente las de mis colegas del Comité Federal de Mercado Abierto o\ndel Sistema de la Reserva Federal. Dicho esto, he pensado que hoy podría hablar un poco\nsobre cómo la pandemia de la COVID-19 ha afectado a la mano de obra hispana. Se trata\nde un tema importante que debemos estudiar en la Reserva Federal porque la comunidad\nhispana es esencial para el crecimiento de nuestra fuerza laboral, y el crecimiento de la\nfuerza laboral es un ingrediente clave del crecimiento económico. Espero que mis\ncomentarios de hoy ofrezcan un contexto útil y de alto nivel para la próxima mesa redonda.\nLos temas importantes que se debatirán, como la educación, la atención de salud y el\nacceso al capital, han contribuido a la manera en que los trabajadores hispanos se las han\narreglado durante la COVID-19 y serán herramientas clave durante la recuperación y más\nallá.\nMientras que la tasa de desempleo capta la mayoría de la atención, hoy quiero examinar a\nla fuerza laboral hispana a través del lente de la relación empleo-población. Esta medida\nre�eja tanto la ausencia de las personas desempleadas y que están buscando el empleo,\ncomo a las que han abandonado por completo a la fuerza laboral, por lo que nos ofrece\nuna imagen más completa de la recuperación del mercado laboral.\nEmpecemos con algo de contexto. Durante las dos últimas décadas, la relación empleopoblación ha sido mayor para la población hispana que para la no hispana. Esto puede\nparecer sorprendente, ya que los trabajadores hispanos han experimentado\n\n\fsistemáticamente tasas de desempleo más altas que los trabajadores no hispanos durante\nel mismo período de tiempo. Pero se debe a la elevada relación empleo-población de los\nhombres hispanos, que desde el año 2000 ha variado entre 4 y 9 puntos porcentuales más\nque la de los hombres no hispanos. En gran parte, esto re�eja el hecho de que los hombres\nhispanos son, en promedio, más jóvenes que los hombres no hispanos y, por tanto, tienen\nmás probabilidades de estar en lo que los economistas llaman \"la mejor edad\" para la\nfuerza laboral. Pero incluso cuando comparamos personas similares, es decir hombres\nhispanos en la mejor edad con hombres no hispanos en la mejor edad, vemos relaciones\nde empleo más altas entre los primeros.\nPor el contrario, las mujeres hispanas han estado históricamente rezagadas en\ncomparación con sus contrapartes no hispanas en lo que respecta al empleo. Sin embargo,\npara febrero de 2020, la prolongada expansión económica, el aumento de los logros\neducativos y un descenso en las tasas de fertilidad habían equiparado la relación empleopoblación de las mujeres hispanas con sus contrapartes no hispanas.\nEl mercado laboral, históricamente fuerte antes de la pandemia, había bene�ciado también\na los trabajadores hispanos masculinos y, en general, la tasa de desempleo de los\ntrabajadores hispanos estaba cerca de su punto más bajo en la historia. El resultado es que\nen febrero de 2020, la brecha entre las relaciones empleo-población entre hispanos y no\nhispanos estaba en su punto más amplio registrado.\nPero entonces llegó la pandemia, y las consecuencias económicas fueron mayores para los\ntrabajadores hispanos que para los no hispanos. Entre febrero y abril de 2020, más del 20%\nde los empleados hispanos perdieron su empleo, en comparación con algo menos del 15%\nde los empleados no hispanos. ¿Y qué fue de esa amplia brecha récord entre las relaciones\nempleo-población que habíamos visto en febrero de 2020? Pues, se redujo a casi cero en\nsólo dos meses.\n¿A qué se debe esto? La concentración de trabajadores hispanos en el sector de servicios\njugó un rol clave. Por ejemplo, en 2019, ellos representaban el 27% de los empleados en los\nservicios de alojamiento y alimentación, en comparación con el 17.6% de la fuerza laboral\ngeneral. Todos conocemos el drástico descenso del empleo que se experimentó en este\nsector al inicio de la pandemia: se perdieron casi la mitad de los puestos de trabajo -un\ndescenso de 6.9 millones- entre febrero y abril de 2020. Y si echamos una mirada más\namplia a todas las ocupaciones de servicios, vemos que emplean a una cuarta parte de\ntrabajadores hispanos. La proporción es aún mayor para las mujeres hispanas: casi un\ntercio trabaja en ocupaciones de servicios. Esto es sorprendente, teniendo en cuenta que la\nproporción de todos los trabajadores empleados en ocupaciones de servicios es menos de\nuna quinta parte.\nEsta concentración en puestos de servicio, que operan en gran medida de forma\npresencial, también signi�có que los trabajadores hispanos tenían menos probabilidades\nde tener empleos que les permitieran trabajar desde casa. El Instituto de Política\nEconómica ha estimado que sólo el 15% de los empleados hispanos pudieron realizar\n\n\fteletrabajo en respuesta a la pandemia, en comparación con el 26% de los empleados\nblancos no hispanos. Esto puede haber agravado los desafíos laborales para los\ntrabajadores hispanos, especialmente para las mujeres, dado el cierre de escuelas,\nguarderías y centros de atención de adultos mayores.\nLa concentración en puestos de servicio también signi�có que aquellos trabajadores que\nno perdieron su empleo se enfrentaban a un mayor riesgo de exposición a la COVID-19, un\nriesgo que se extendió a sus hijos y padres, ya que los adultos hispanos son más\npropensos a vivir en hogares multigeneracionales. Y de hecho, las comunidades hispanas\nhan soportado una carga desproporcionada de la COVID-19. Aunque los hispanos\nconstituyen el 18% de la población estadounidense, representaban casi el 29% de los casos\nde COVID-19 hasta el 23 de junio, según los datos de los Centros de Control y Prevención\nde Enfermedades. La tasa de hospitalización es 2.8 veces mayor y la tasa de mortalidad es\n2.3 veces mayor.\nHemos sufrido pérdidas trágicas, pero la recuperación económica está en marcha. Las\nvacunas están cada vez más disponibles y, a medida que van disminuyendo los casos de\nCOVID-19, la actividad económica se va recuperando. La demanda de mano de obra parece\nfuerte, y estamos viendo ofertas de trabajo históricamente altas.\nEl empleo hispano se ha recuperado rápidamente. A mayo, el empleo hispano es un 4.8%\nmenor de lo que era en febrero de 2020, en comparación con un 4.4% menor para el\nempleo no hispano. Teniendo en cuenta la caída inicial más pronunciada en el empleo\nhispano, esto es notable. Y si se observa la relación empleo-población, una vez más ha\nsurgido una brecha, ya que la relación para los trabajadores hispanos es de 3 puntos\nporcentuales más alta que para los trabajadores no hispanos.\nEs importante señalar, sin embargo, que los datos agregados ocultan la recuperación más\nlenta de las mujeres hispanas. Una vez más, los hombres hispanos son los que marcan la\ndiferencia en la relación empleo-población, mientras que las mujeres hispanas van\nrezagadas de las mujeres no hispanas. De hecho, los hombres hispanos están más cerca de\nla recuperación del pleno empleo que los hombres no hispanos: el número de hombres\nhispanos que trabajan es solamente 1% menor que lo que era en febrero de 2020, en\ncomparación con el 3.3% inferior de los hombres no hispanos. En contraste, 5.3% menos\nmujeres hispanas están trabajando que en febrero de 2020, en comparación con un 2.8%\nmenos de mujeres no hispanas. De nuevo, la industria juega un rol importante en estas\ndiferencias. Aunque las industrias de servicios, como el ocio y la hostelería, siguen\nagregando puestos de trabajo, todavía hay un gran dé�cit en comparación con la situación\nprevia a la pandemia. Y aunque la continua reapertura del sector de servicios podría\npermitir a las mujeres hispanas recuperar el terreno perdido, es posible que veamos un\ndaño duradero. Por ejemplo, los puestos de trabajo en el sector de servicios pueden\nparecer menos atractivos que hace año y medio, y no todo el mundo está dispuesto o es\ncapaz de invertir y volver a capacitarse en una nueva carrera.\nEntonces, ¿qué necesitamos para contribuir a una recuperación más completa? Hay\n\n\falgunas palancas que vale la pena explorar.\nEl despliegue de las vacunas ha\nimpulsado la recuperación económica. Pero todavía hay margen de crecimiento entre la\ncomunidad hispana. Al �n de junio, los datos de 40 estados mostraban que el 38% de los\nhispanos había recibido al menos una dosis de la vacuna de la COVID-19, en comparación\ncon el 46% de los blancos. Si podemos superar las barreras de acceso y las brechas de\ninformación, podemos avanzar e impulsar nuestra recuperación.\nEl Congreso aprobó el año pasado un\nestímulo histórico. Al igual que las vacunas, el estímulo sólo es e�caz cuando llega a la\npersona individual. Los programas de ayuda con el alquiler están empezando a ponerse en\nmarcha, y los pagos de los créditos �scales por hijos empezarán en julio. Sabemos que las\ncomunidades hispanas se enfrentan a obstáculos únicos para acceder a la ayuda, que van\ndesde las barreras lingüísticas hasta la indecisión inducida por la inmigración, pero si\npodemos garantizar que la ayuda disponible esté llegando a las personas individuales,\nentonces veremos una recuperación aún más sólida.\nEl Programa de\nprotección de cheques de pago ya no acepta nuevas solicitudes, pero nuestra necesidad de\nfomentar el crecimiento de las pequeñas empresas sigue vigente. Según una medida, el\nnúmero de pequeñas empresas abiertas hoy en día sigue estando un cuarenta y cuatro\nporciento por debajo del nivel de enero de 2020. La pérdida se ha sentido especialmente\nmás entre las empresas de propiedad de mujeres hispanas. Las empresas de propiedad\nhispana son vitales para nuestro ecosistema de pequeñas empresas: después de la Gran\nRecesión, el número de pequeñas empresas en los Estados Unidos habría disminuido si no\nfuera por el crecimiento de las empresas de propiedad hispana.\nTengo la esperanza de que con el impulso actual de nuestra economía y los esfuerzos\npersistentes en estas tres áreas, veremos un crecimiento continuo en la economía general\ny en la fuerza laboral hispana. Con esto, permítanme pasarles la palabra a nuestros\npanelistas de la mesa redonda. Estoy deseando escuchar sus puntos de vista.\nGracias a Maia Cotelo y Abigail Crockett por asistir en la preparación de estos comentarios.\nLas fuentes de información se pueden encontrar en la versión en ingles del discurso.\n\nEconomic Inequality and Poverty\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\n\fReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nVirtual Presentation to Regional Hispanic Chambers of Commerce\n\nThanks for inviting me to be with you today, and a special thank you to the Maryland\nHispanic Chamber for hosting us. This is the �rst time these �ve chambers have gotten\ntogether, and I hope it’s the start of a new tradition. We have a lot to learn from one\nanother, and I am con�dent the discussions today will inspire new ideas for all of us.\nBefore I dive in, I have to note that the views I express are my own and not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve\nSystem. That said, I thought I might spend some time today talking about how the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has a�ected the Hispanic workforce. This is an important topic for us\nto study at the Fed because the Hispanic community is essential to the growth of our\nworkforce, and workforce growth is a key ingredient of economic growth. I hope that my\nremarks today will provide helpful, high-level context for the upcoming roundtable. The\nimportant issues that will be discussed, such as education, health care and access to\ncapital, contributed to how Hispanic workers fared during COVID-19 and will be key tools\nduring the recovery and beyond.\nWhile the unemployment rate gets most of the attention, today I want to look at the\nHispanic workforce through the lens of the employment-to-population ratio. As the name\nimplies, this measure tells us the share of a given population that is working. Because it\naccounts for both people who are unemployed and looking for work and people who have\ndropped out of the labor force entirely, it gives us a more complete picture of the labor\nmarket’s recovery.\nLet’s start with some background. During the past two decades, the employment-topopulation ratio has been higher for the Hispanic population than the non-Hispanic\npopulation. This might seem surprising since Hispanic workers have consistently\nexperienced higher unemployment rates than non-Hispanic workers during the same time\nperiod. But it’s driven by the high employment-to-population ratio of Hispanic men, which\n\n\fsince 2000, has ranged from 4 to 9 percentage points higher than that of non-Hispanic\nmen. In large part, this re�ects the fact that Hispanic men on average are younger than\nnon-Hispanic men and thus are more likely to be what economists call “prime age” for the\nworkforce. But even when we compare apples to apples — prime-age Hispanic men to\nprime-age non-Hispanic men — we see higher employment ratios among the former.\nIn contrast, Hispanic women have historically trailed their non-Hispanic counterparts with\nrespect to employment. But by February 2020, the lengthy economic expansion, increased\neducational attainment and a decline in fertility rates had brought the employment-topopulation ratio for Hispanic women in line with that of their non-Hispanic peers.\nThe historically strong labor market prior to the pandemic had bene�ted male Hispanic\nworkers as well, and overall, the unemployment rate for Hispanic workers was near its\nlowest point ever. The upshot is that in February 2020, the gap between the Hispanic and\nnon-Hispanic employment-to-population ratios was at its widest point on record.\nBut then the pandemic hit, and the economic fallout was larger for Hispanic workers than\nnon-Hispanic workers. Between February and April 2020, more than 20 percent of Hispanic\nemployees lost their jobs, compared with just under 15 percent of non-Hispanic employees.\nAnd that record-wide gap between employment-to-population ratios that we’d seen in\nFebruary 2020? It shrank to about zero in just two months.\nWhy was this? Hispanic workers' concentration in the services sector played a key role. For\nexample, as of 2019, they accounted for 27 percent of employees in accommodation and\nfood services, compared to 17.6 percent of the workforce overall. We’re all familiar with\nthe drastic employment declines this industry experienced at the onset of the pandemic: It\nlost nearly half of its jobs — a decline of 6.9 million — between February and April 2020.\nAnd looking more broadly at all service occupations, we see they employ one-quarter of\nHispanic workers. The share is even larger for Hispanic women; almost one-third work in\nservice occupations. This is striking, considering that the share of all workers employed in\nservice occupations is less than one-�fth.\nThis concentration in service occupations, which operate largely in person, also meant that\nHispanic workers were less likely to have jobs that allowed them to work from home. The\nEconomic Policy Institute has estimated that only 15 percent of Hispanic employees were\nable to telework in response to the pandemic, compared with 26 percent of white nonHispanic employees. This may have exacerbated employment challenges for Hispanic\nworkers, especially women, given school, child care and elder care closures.\nConcentration in service occupations also meant that those workers who didn’t lose their\njobs faced a greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 — a risk that extended to their children\nand parents, as Hispanic adults are more likely to live in multigenerational households.\nAnd indeed, Hispanic communities have borne a disproportionate burden from COVID-19.\nAlthough Hispanics are about 18 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for nearly\n29 percent of COVID-19 cases as of June 28, according to Centers for Disease Control and\n\n\fPrevention data. The hospitalization rate is 2.8 times higher for Hispanics than for white\nnon-Hispanics, and the death rate is 2.3 times higher.\nWe have experienced tragic losses, but the economic recovery is underway. Vaccines are\nwidely and increasingly available, and, as COVID-19 cases drop, economic activity is picking\nup. The demand for labor looks strong, and we are seeing historically high job openings.\nHispanic employment has recovered quickly. As of May, Hispanic employment is 4.8\npercent lower than it was in February 2020, compared with 4.4 percent lower for nonHispanic employment. Considering the steeper initial drop for Hispanic employment, this is\nnotable. And looking at the employment-to-population ratio, a gap has once again\nemerged, with the ratio for Hispanic workers 3 percentage points higher than for nonHispanic workers.\nIt’s important to note, however, that the aggregate data hide the slower recovery of\nHispanic women. Once again, Hispanic men are driving the gap in employment-topopulation ratios, while Hispanic women lag behind non-Hispanic women. In fact, Hispanic\nmen are closer to full employment recovery than non-Hispanic men: The number of\nHispanic men working is just 1 percent lower than it was in February 2020, compared with\n3.3 lower for non-Hispanic men. In contrast, 5.3 percent fewer Hispanic women are working\nthan in February 2020, compared with 2.8 percent fewer non-Hispanic women. Again,\nindustry plays a big role in these di�erences. Although service industries, such as leisure\nand hospitality, continue to add jobs, there’s still a large de�cit compared to before the\npandemic. And while the continued reopening of the services sector might allow Hispanic\nwomen to regain the ground they’ve lost, it’s possible we’ll see long-lasting damage. For\nexample, service jobs might seem less attractive than they did a year and a half ago, and\nnot everyone is willing or able to make an investment in retraining for a new career.\nWhat do we need to contribute to a fuller recovery? There are a few levers worth exploring.\nThe vaccine rollout has fueled\nthe economic recovery. But there’s still room for growth among the Hispanic community. As\nof late June, data from 40 states showed that 38 percent of Hispanics had received at least\none COVID-19 vaccine dose, compared with 46 percent of whites. If we can get beyond\naccess barriers and information gaps, we can make progress and bolster our recovery.\nCongress passed historic stimulus over the past\nyear. Much like vaccines, the stimulus is only e�ective when it reaches individuals. Rental\nrelief programs are starting to get going, and child tax credit payments begin in July. We\nknow Hispanic communities face unique obstacles to accessing aid, ranging from language\nbarriers to immigration-induced hesitation, but if we can ensure available support is\nreaching individuals, then we will see an even stronger recovery.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program is no\nlonger accepting new applications, but our need to foster growth among small businesses\nremains. By one measure, the number of small businesses open today is down more than\n\n\f44 percent from January 2020. The loss has been especially acute for businesses owned\nby Hispanic women. Hispanic-owned businesses are vital to our small business ecosystem:\nAfter the Great Recession, the number of small businesses in the United States would have\ndeclined were it not for the growth in Hispanic-owned �rms.\nI’m hopeful that with our economy’s current momentum and persistent e�orts in these\nthree areas, we will see continued growth in the overall economy and in the Hispanic\nworkforce. With that, let me turn it over to our roundtable panelists. I look forward to\nhearing their perspectives.\nThank you to Maia Cotelo and Abigail Crockett for assistance preparing these remarks.\nUnless otherwise speci�ed, employment data come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\nand are seasonally adjusted by either BLS or Haver Analytics.\nEmployed persons by detailed industry, BLS.\nEmployed persons by occupation, BLS.\nGould, Elise, and Jori Kandra. “Only One in Five Workers Are Working From Home Due to\nCOVID.” Economic Policy Institute’s “Working Economics Blog,” June 2, 2021.\nCohn, D’Vera, and Je�rey S.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nVisit District Dialogues for video highlights from the Richmond Fed's recent conversations about\neducational disparities and COVID-19.\nWe spent the spring talking to educators, administrators, researchers and policymakers\nabout how the COVID-19 pandemic has a�ected students and what we can do to help close\nthe gaps. We learned a lot — and it wasn’t always what we were expecting.\n• White students had more access to in-person school. Overall, black and Hispanic students\nwere less likely to be given the option to return to in-person school. But even when\nstudents did have the option to return to in-person school, minority families were\nmore likely to remain virtual — perhaps because they faced higher infection and\nfatality rates from COVID-19. But it also means these students may face greater\nlearning loss as research shows that virtual learning is an imperfect substitute for faceto-face instruction. Income and wealth were a contributing factor, as higher-income\nfamilies had more resources for private schools, tutors and learning “pods.”\n• Recovering that learning loss is going to take an intense and dedicated e�ort. That includes\nsummer school, high-intensity tutoring, acceleration academies and the like. These\nsolutions can be unpopular and are expensive to implement at scale, but the cost pales\nin comparison to the cost if we do nothing.\n• Parents are going to need help. We heard from educators across the region that parental\ninvolvement, especially in lower-income communities where students are already at\nrisk, is a challenge, whether that’s staying home to help kids get online or driving them\nto extra tutoring sessions. It’s not because parents don’t want to help — it’s because\nthey’re riding a bus for hours to get to work, as we heard in Yemassee, South Carolina;\nor because they’re themselves looking for work; or because they don’t have a car.\nSolutions need to recognize and address these barriers.\n\n\f• We have e�ective tools to increase access to higher education — we need to expand them.\nDespite the di�erences in their schools, both Ángel Cabrera and Meredith Woo\nadvocated for a major expansion of the federal Pell Grant program, which gives grants\nto undergraduate students with exceptional �nancial need and generally don’t have to\nbe repaid. We’ve come to similar conclusions from our own research and outreach on\nthe potential upside of Pell Grants, speci�cally allowing students to use Pell Grants at\ncommunity colleges to pay for noncredit workforce training and credential programs\nthat would bene�t students, schools, employers and taxpayers.\n• Broadband access isn’t only an issue in rural areas. We also heard from educators in\nurban areas about the challenges their students face getting connected: sometimes\nthey live in areas with poor service, sometimes they can’t a�ord service, sometimes\nthey don’t have devices and sometimes all three. Expanding broadband access is\ncritical. As one panelist, Oleta Garrett Fitzgerald (Southern Regional Director, Children’s\nDefense Fund) explained, “[N]ot having internet in 2021 is like not having lights.”\n• More money alone isn’t the solution. Allocating money is just the beginning — we also\nneed to make a concerted e�ort to distribute the money to where it’s needed most and\nreduce the hang-ups that make it hard to spend. That requires e�ective alignment\nthrough partnerships — nonpro�ts, local governments, and private companies pulling\nin the same direction — to build awareness and capacity in communities.\nAmid all the challenges, though, we learned about some unexpected silver linings.\n• Stimulus funding helped schools meet long-standing goals. For example, we talked to\nadministrators who were able to purchase computers, mobile devices and other\ntechnology that had been on their wish lists for years. Vance-Granville Community\nCollege, in North Carolina, used stimulus funds to buy tractor trailers for its new truck\ndriver training course.\n• Virtual learning helped the best teachers reach more students. In a typical setup, a teacher\nonly reaches the students in his or her classroom. But with online instruction, the most\ntalented and experienced teachers could help students beyond their four walls.\n• Virtual learning helped meet the needs of some underserved populations. We learned\nabout incarcerated students in Baltimore, for example, who gained access to materials\nand instruction they’d never had before — and thrived.\nBy most measures, the pandemic may be in the rearview mirror — infections are falling,\nvaccinations are rising, businesses are reopening, and schools are planning to resume inperson instruction in the fall. Still, our period of remote learning has led to new challenges,\nincluding addressing learning loss and its implications for labor force participation and\naccess to higher education. I greatly appreciate all who joined us for this dialogue.\n\n\fEducation\n\nBroadband\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nThe pandemic has changed us. It reminded us how precious time with family and work-life\nbalance are. It threatened baby boomers’ health while expanding their 401k plans, perhaps\ndriving the recent surge in retirements. It even allowed us to discover hidden talents, like\nbaking or gardening, increasing the value we place in our leisure time. Many of these shifts\ncould dampen future workforce participation and productivity. But one change, if it\npersists, could be a force in the opposite direction — a productivity booster. We saw a\ndramatic reduction in �u incidence.\nFlu season comes every winter. While we never know how severe it will be, we know it will\nbe disruptive. But we’ve never seen the pendulum swing this far before. This winter, we\nbasically bypassed the entire �u season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) estimates we had 38 million �u cases the winter before the pandemic. But reported\n�u incidence was so low this season that the CDC hasn’t even published estimates.\nWe can see the same decline by looking just at the reported cases, which are much lower\nthan the CDC’s total estimates each year. Positive �u tests dropped from tens of thousands\nper week during the winter of 2019-2020 to just hundreds or fewer per week this past year.\nAccording to local news coverage, reported �u cases in Japan were down more than 99\npercent from the previous season’s levels. The data are clear: There has been a global drop\nin �u incidence.\nWe have a pretty good idea why. We made decisions to reduce our personal and collective\nrisks. We stayed home and avoided crowds. If we went out or worked in person, we wore\nmasks, distanced ourselves and were hyperaware of hygienic precautions. These individual\ndecisions were matched with institutional actions, such as paid leave incentives and facility\nmodi�cations that normalized hand sanitizer stations and socially distanced �oor plans.\nThe realization that we may be able to mitigate the impact of �u season is powerful. We\nnow know that the annual disruption is not necessarily a given. That leads me to wonder:\nWhat if we could retain this low infection rate beyond the pandemic? What could we gain in\n\n\ffuture years?\nFor one, we would see fewer deaths. While we may tend to think of the �u as an\ninconvenience rather than a lethal threat, tens of thousands of people die from the �u each\nyear. The CDC estimates 22,000 individuals passed away from the illness during the\n2019-2020 season. Nearly three times that many people died during the severe 2017-2018\nseason. And while those �gures may seem low compared to our recent experience with\nCOVID-19, the �u is an annual occurrence, not a once-in-a-generation pandemic. In�uenza\nand pneumonia are among the top 10 leading causes of U.S. deaths every year.\nThe second-order bene�ts of fewer deaths would be considerable. The majority of �u\ndeaths occur among older Americans, a group whose increasing labor force participation is\ncritical to our workforce over the coming years. Reducing �u incidence could also help us\navoid emotional, �nancial and productivity losses. A 2018 study places the �nancial loss\nfrom lost earnings due to �u deaths at $4 billion.\nWe would also see fewer hospitalizations. Approximately 400,000 individuals were\nhospitalized with the �u during the 2019-2020 season, according to the CDC. More than\ndouble that number were hospitalized during the 2017-2018 season. Reducing �u cases as\nwe have this past year could reduce hospitalizations by nearly tenfold. Fewer\nhospitalizations could reduce medical costs by up to $3.2 billion each year and free up\nscarce medical resources such as provider time and hospital beds.\nEven reducing nonsevere cases would help our economy. Fewer missed days of work would\nincrease output, particularly for smaller �rms that struggle to continue normal operations\nwhen �u outbreaks hit their workforce. Annual �u-related employment absences average\n20.1 million days, at a cost of $3.8 billion, according to one estimate. Estimates from the\nglobal outplacement �rm Challenger, Gray & Christmas place the cost of the 2019-2020 �u\nseason at approximately three times those levels (57.3 million days and $13 billion). To put\nthose estimates into perspective, that’s equivalent to every one of the 2.7 million workers in\nthe grocery store subsector missing between eight and 21 days of work each year just due\nto the �u. Those missing days of work hurt the employer and the employee, but they also\na�ect individual consumption — which then a�ects other businesses. As we’ve learned\nduring the pandemic, we can spend less when we are home than when we are going out to\nlunch or popping into stores after work.\nWe could also see fewer low-productivity work days. It’s pretty hard to be e�ective while\nbattling the �u or while taking care of a loved one who’s ill. That raises another bene�t of\nmitigating the �u: reduced school absenteeism. Given the learning gap we face coming out\nof the pandemic, every day in the classroom matters.\nFewer deaths and hospitalizations. Less productivity loss at work. More consumption.\nReduced school absenteeism. The bene�ts are compelling. But are we likely to see this\nlower infection rate continue?\nSome �u-suppressing behaviors are going to go away. We have an understandable desire\n\n\fto gather, to collaborate, to shake hands or hug and to smile with more than just our eyes.\nAs the pandemic eases, we are already relaxing.\nBut we don’t necessarily need to quarantine ourselves to have a real impact on �u\nincidence. Perhaps the lessons from the COVID-19 vaccines will enhance the e�ectiveness\nand take up of �u vaccines. Perhaps businesses will maintain policies that have helped\nreduce spread this year, such as remote work options, leave for sick employees, hand\nsanitizing stations and facility modi�cations. Perhaps each of us will internalize a healthier\nset of behaviors.\nI will try to do my part and retain some of my pandemic habits. I'll be taking some extra\nseconds for hand-washing and reserving my hugging primarily for family. Perhaps others\nwill do the same, and we can elbow bump our way to a healthier, more productive\neconomy.\nPutri, Wayan C. W. S., David J. Muscatello, Melissa S. Stockwell, and Anthony T.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nGiven the historic job losses experienced during spring 2020, we might have expected wage\ngrowth to have slowed considerably during the pandemic. After all, nominal wage growth,\nas measured by the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker, declined in the wake of the Great\nRecession, falling from 4.5 percent in December 2007 to 1.8 percent in October 2010, and\nremained sluggish for years. But it has been heartening to see that during the COVID-19\nrecession, the decline in wage growth has not mirrored the scale of job loss. COVID-19\nbrought only a muted and brief decline. In February 2020, overall wage growth was 4\npercent. It hit its lowest point of the pandemic, 3.6 percent, by the end of the year. Wage\ngrowth in early 2021 has stayed near that level, �uctuating between 3.6 percent and 3.7\npercent.\nWhat cut the dive so short in comparison to the prior recession? I would point to three\nfactors: the concentrated nature of the downturn, the perception that it would be short in\nduration and the impact of the policy response.\nDamage to the economy was heavily concentrated in the service sectors, a�ecting primarily\nlow-skill workers. This stands in contrast to the Great Recession and its impact on\nmanufacturing, construction and �nance. As a consequence, downward wage pressure did\nnot ripple out much to workers overall. Low-skill wage growth did fall 0.7 percentage points\nbetween February 2020 and January 2021; at the same time, wage growth in middle- and\nhigh-skill occupations fell by only 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively.\nThe uncertainty of the pandemic also dampened its impact on wages. Early on, the\nshutdowns and job losses seemed temporary. Many were thinking in two-week timelines\nand therefore had little focus on adjusting wages even as short-term demand for labor\nplummeted. By the time the extended length of the disruption became obvious, Congress’\npolicy response had bolstered demand for labor. By supporting businesses through the\nPaycheck Protection Program and consumers through direct payments, policy helped\nmitigate downward pressure on wages as well.\n\n\fWe are now well into the recovery, and I hear businesses around the Richmond Fed’s Fifth\nDistrict say they are struggling to �nd workers. Basic supply and demand would suggest\nthat a scarcity of workers should lead to faster wage growth and indeed, it seems that every\nday you see another company announcing entry-level wage increases. But the data don’t\nyet show much rebound in overall wage growth; at 3.6 percent in April 2021, it remains\nnear its recent low and below pre-pandemic levels, not yet re�ecting the escalation that\nanecdotes prime us to expect.\nData limitations could be one factor; it might take time for recent announcements to be\nre�ected. Concentration again likely plays a role. The hiring challenges we’re hearing about\nare primarily for lower-skill jobs. Between January and April 2021, wage growth for low-skill\noccupations increased from 3 percent to 3.5 percent. In the same period, wage growth for\nmid-skill occupations declined 0.1 percentage points and was unchanged for high-skill\noccupations. Because of how the wage tracker is calculated, these increases at lower skill\nlevels have a muted e�ect on the overall numbers.\nDuration may also be having a dampening e�ect, as it did in the spring. Many businesses,\nbelieving that labor supply is being only temporarily suppressed by issues of child care,\nhealth or stimulus, are pushing through to the fall, avoiding “sticky” wage increases. They\nare using short-term measures such as recruiting bonuses and one-time signing bonuses.\nBut if and when more employers adjust base wages, the impact could be more persistent.\nPolicy, having stabilized wages during the pandemic, might well amplify wage pressures\ngoing forward. A number of our contacts point to the impact that government stimulus\nchecks and enhanced unemployment bene�ts could be playing in suppressing labor supply.\nSo, where will wage growth go from here? Given that the initial decline in wage growth was\nunexpectedly muted and the recovery has brought stories of wage pressure even as\nmillions remain on the sidelines, I won’t venture to predict the future. However, I will be\nwatching the same three factors over the next several months, as I think they will matter:\n•\n\n: Does wage pressure stay concentrated in the lower end of wages, or\ndoes it start to put pressure further up the wage ladder?\n\n•\n\n: Will “temporary” factors such as health concerns and school closures\ndisappear, freeing up labor supply, or will their impact linger? Will announced entrylevel wage increases pressure others to do the same?\n\n•\n\n: Will the impact of policy on labor supply subside at the end of the summer? Or\nwill additional policy impacts be felt on the demand side, for example via infrastructure\nspending, or on the supply side, via the forthcoming monthly child tax credit or\nminimum wage legislation?\n\nLonger term, wage growth is in�uenced by numerous additional factors, in particular\ntechnological change as re�ected in productivity growth. Understanding these dynamics,\nand how they interact, is essential to our understanding of how wage growth �ts into the\nmacroeconomy more broadly and is a priority for Richmond Fed researchers.\n\n\fThe Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker re�ects the median percent change in the hourly\nwage of individuals observed 12 months apart. Aggregate statistics are weighted 12-month\nmoving averages, while those broken down by occupation are unweighted 12-month moving\naverages.\nLow-skill occupations include food preparation and serving, cleaning, individual care services\nand protective services. Middle-skill occupations include o�ce and administration, operators,\nproduction, and sales, while high-skill occupations comprise managers, professionals and\ntechnicians.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nThe “she-cession” has been a dominant narrative of this pandemic. Unlike the Great\nRecession, which primarily a�ected male-dominated sectors such as manufacturing and\nconstruction, the COVID-19 recession disrupted the service sector, which employs more\nwomen. From February to April 2020, women’s employment fell 17.9 percent, compared to\n14.3 percent for men. More than 12 million jobs held by women went away, and school\nclosures and child care constraints further limited workforce participation for primary\ncaregivers who are disproportionately women. Employment of women of all ages, races\nand educational levels fell more than employment of men with similar backgrounds.\nBut, over the last several months, that overall gap has largely closed. As of the\nMay 2021 jobs report, employment for women and men was down 5 percent and 4.6\npercent, respectively — a di�erence of just a few tenths of a percentage point. But it’s\nimportant to note that not all women have recovered equally. And a new dichotomy has\nsurfaced by age.\nTo be clear, the employment recovery for\nwomen still trails the recovery of\nsimilarly educated men. For women with a high school diploma or less, employment is still\ndown more than 9 percent, compared to 5 percent for men with the same education. Black\nand Hispanic women have also seen a slow recovery. Compared to February\n2020, employment is still 7.4 percent lower for black women and 6.4 percent lower\nfor Hispanic women. But it’s down 4.1 percent for black men and 2.1 percent\nfor Hispanic men.\nMinorities and women with lower levels of education are more likely to work in low-wage\nroles with a high degree of personal contact, such as those in leisure and hospitality, that\nwere disrupted by the pandemic. As of 2019, 10.1 percent of women without a bachelor’s\ndegree worked in leisure and hospitality, compared to 8.4 percent of men without a\nbachelor’s degree. Almost 30 percent of women without a bachelor’s degree were\nemployed in service occupations, compared to just under 16 percent of their male peers.\n\n\fIn contrast, college-educated women are now actually\ntheir male peers —\ntheir employment in April 2021 was 2.1 percent higher than it was in February 2020,\ncompared to 0.8 percent lower for college-educated men. Part of the reason may again be\nsector mix. Nearly 50 percent of women with bachelor's degrees work in education and\nhealth care, sectors where employment has fared relatively well for college-educated\nworkers.\nThese employment di�erences by educational levels may well be driven by disparities in\ncircumstances. In a late 2020 study, 19 percent of adults with a high school degree had\nsomeone in their household who had substituted remote work for in-person work, versus\n62 percent of adults with a bachelor’s degree. Women not able to work remotely may well\nhave been more concerned about their health or less able to �nd an alternative\narrangement to support child care or remote schooling. Perhaps those concerns reduced\ntheir ability to participate in the workforce.\nAnother segment where women are now outperforming men is older workers. Employment\nis down 6 percent for men 55 and older, versus 5.5 percent for women the same\nage, compared to February 2020.\nThis comes amid a surge in retirement, which accounts for nearly 50 percent of the decline\nin overall labor force participation. And many of those retirements likely wouldn’t have\nhappened were it not for the pandemic: Excess retirements, meaning people who appear\nto have retired earlier than they otherwise would have, account for more than half of this\ndrop.\nWhy did the pandemic push people to retire? There are numerous potential explanations,\nincluding fear of exposure to the coronavirus, family responsibilities such as caring for\nelderly parents or grandkids, or �rm incentives like early retirement packages. Older\nworkers might also have been more hesitant about the steep learning curve associated\nwith remote work or about the challenge of training for a new position after a layo�. And\nfor workers with 401(k) accounts, the robust stock market may have made retirement more\n�nancially feasible.\nThese factors a�ect men and women equally, so they don’t explain why employment is now\nrecovering somewhat more strongly for women. As with educational di�erences, the\nanswer might be industry mix. Looking at job loss among older workers, the industries in\nwhich older women are the most concentrated — education and health — together fared\nbetter than the industries in which men are the most concentrated (professional and\nbusiness services, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade). But less visible factors\ncould also play a role. Older men on average are less healthy than women, and their\ncomorbidities could have given them higher vulnerability to COVID-19. This may have\nreduced their willingness to engage in the workforce during the pandemic.\nSo what’s ahead? As the service sector returns to normal, it’s likely that its recovery will help\nmany women make up lost ground. Family responsibilities should also become less of a\n\n\fbarrier, as schools and child care facilities reopen. Access to remote work may become an\nenabler of �exibility rather than employment.\nBringing retirees back might be more of a challenge. Historically, the likelihood of retirees\nreturning to the workforce has been very low. But maybe COVID-19 retirements will be\ndi�erent — perhaps, once wages grow and barriers such as health concerns or family\nresponsibilities disappear, retirees will be lured back to the labor force.\nWe may still see some scarring when we reach our new normal. This could take the form of\nskill mismatch for lower-wage workers and technology requirements for\nretirees. Research also shows that the longer someone is unemployed, the harder it is to\n�nd work, as both skills and relationships weaken with time.\nGrowing the economy means growing the workforce, and the Richmond Fed focuses on the\nevolving story of workforce engagement as we monitor progress toward maximum\nemployment. That in turn requires understanding employment success by demographic\nsegment and recognizing that the story changes over time. But one theme common to all\nour analyses is that our least educated citizens face major challenges, and the returns of\ninvesting in education are high. This pandemic has been no di�erent.\nAll calculations based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics via Haver and IPUMS-CPS.\nThe probability is 1.4 percent, according to Andreas Hornstein, Marianna Kudlyak, Fabian\nLange, and Tim Sablik, “Does the Unemployment Rate Really Overstate Labor Market\nRecovery ?” Richmond Fed Economic Brief no. 14-06, June 2014.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nEducation\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\n\fEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nIn the past year or so, Congress has passed the largest stimulus bill in American history —\ntwice. Almost $6 trillion has been allocated in response to COVID-19 to date, and at least\n$3.7 trillion has been disbursed or committed. These have been critical investments to help\nsmall businesses and unemployed workers get to the other side of this crisis.\nDespite this funding, we still hear from many people across our district that they are\nstruggling to pay the rent, feed their families, and stay connected to work and school —\neven though these are areas Congress has targeted. For example, $47 billion has been\nallocated speci�cally for emergency rental assistance, yet the Philadelphia Fed estimates\nthat the 1.8 million renter households in arrears still owe $11 billion in rent. And roughly\n$70 billion has been directed toward nutrition assistance, but 45 million people (including\n15 million children) were projected to face food insecurity in 2020.\nWhen it comes to broadband, between 18 million and 42 million people don’t have access\nto high-speed service. More than $13 billion has been made available during the pandemic\nto expand access and help people pay their bills, and the American Rescue Plan includes\nthe potential for up to $10 billion in additional investment. That’s in addition to the roughly\n$30 billion that had been dedicated to broadband before the pandemic. But our analysis\nsuggests that less than half of this prior funding has been distributed due to challenges\nwith application approvals, map de�nitions and the like. So we could see di�culties with\nthe latest rounds of funding as well.\nWhat is standing between the trillions of dollars in support and the people who need it?\nTalking with community leaders throughout our district, we’ve heard four key themes.\nWhether communities are working to provide short-time emergency aid (such as housing\nassistance) or long-term infrastructure (such as broadband), delivering the “last mile”\nrequires awareness, capacity, simpli�cation and alignment.\nThe �rst challenge is awareness: It’s hard to apply for help if you don’t know it exists. In a\nFebruary survey, for example, the rental management company Avail found that almost 48\n\n\fpercent of landlords and 69 percent of renters didn’t know government rental assistance\nwas available. And even people who are aware that programs exist might not know how to\n�nd a local program or how to apply. Similarly, many adults don’t know that there’s an\nemergency broadband bene�t coming to help them pay their internet bills. (Takeup has\nalso been quite low for the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC’s) Lifeline subsidy\nprogram, which predates the pandemic.) The solutions to raise awareness don’t have to be\ncomplicated — but they require knowing who you’re serving and what they need. For\nexample, when we talked with Hispanic business and community leaders in Manassas, Va.,\nlast month, we heard that reaching immigrant populations has been especially challenging.\nProviding translation assistance and sharing information through trusted local groups can\ngo a long way.\nAnother challenge is that many communities don’t have the capacity — either in terms of\npeople or in terms of technology — to distribute funding. Looking again at rental\nassistance, state and local governments have been responsible for administering these\nprograms from beginning to end: getting the word out, determining eligibility, reviewing\napplications, distributing payouts and all the tasks in between. That’s a lot to do in a short\ntime, especially amid an unprecedented public health crisis. As a result, many local\ngovernments have partnered with nonpro�t organizations to increase their capacity and try\nto meet the demand, but these nonpro�ts are themselves trying to adapt their operations\nand increase their bandwidth.\nWe see similar challenges with nutrition assistance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) has bought billions of dollars of produce, meat and dairy products from farmers\nwho have lost business due to closed schools and restaurants, and distributed the food to\nlocal food banks nationwide. But especially at the beginning of the pandemic, many food\nbanks didn’t have the logistical capacity — not to mention the storage space — to manage\nthe increase in supply and demand, and they’ve been racing to keep up.\nA little bit of money (at least relative to the stimulus) can go a long way, though. The Annie\nE. Casey Foundation provided $100,000 to hire a consultant to assist the City of Baltimore\nin developing and coordinating temporary rental assistance and enhanced eviction\nprevention programs with multiple city agencies. Collectively, these agencies will distribute\nmore than $40 million of CARES Act and other funding to support renter households\nexperiencing COVID-19-related income and job loss.\nCapacity was a challenge before COVID-19 as well. Take broadband funding, which is\ntraditionally distributed to local groups through grants from national entities, such as the\nFCC or the USDA. But applying for these grants is a complicated process and requires a\ncommunity to have the capacity to research eligibility — to understand and compete for\nvarious available grants, to fund technical support for successful proposals and\npartnerships, and to measure and record actual broadband access (or lack thereof). That’s\nwhy organizations like the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, which serves West\nVirginia and Southwest Pennsylvania, are so important. They provide grants to\n\n\fcommunities to help them �ll gaps in necessary technical support costs and federal match\nrequirements so they can develop the resources they need to take advantage of broadband\nfunding.\nThe third challenge we’ve heard is the complicated constraints that accompany government\nfunding. Of course, we want the government to be careful with our tax dollars, but\nstipulations about when and how the money has to be spent don’t always align with local\nneeds. For example, we’ve been talking with educators from throughout the region for our\nDistrict Dialogues series. One superintendent we spoke with shared that CARES Act funding\nhas been valuable to help pay for digital resources and other supplies but can’t be used for\noperations. So if the school district wants to extend the school day or provide extra tutoring\nto help students address pandemic-related learning loss, it has to take money from other\nplaces in its budget. Simplifying restrictions and giving local jurisdictions more autonomy\ncould help get the money to where it’s needed most.\nSo what does it take to increase awareness, build capacity and navigate complicated\nwaters? When we look at the success stories, the common theme is e�ective alignment\nthrough partnerships — nonpro�ts, local governments, and private companies pulling in\nthe same direction. Working together creates a sense of shared investment, shared cost,\nand enables groups to come up with more creative solutions. For example, in Virginia,\nCommonwealth Connect hosts regular calls between public and private entities to help\nthem be on the same page as advocates for broadband. This model allows groups with\ndi�erent focus areas and resources to clarify what funding is available, where the needs\nare, and which solutions are working. In Maryland, the Baltimore County government\nrecognized it didn’t have the capacity to implement an e�ective eviction prevention\nstrategy, so they engaged the United Way of Central Maryland to work with landlords.\nUnited Way is now talking with two other jurisdictions about replicating this arrangement.\nThe massive �scal support that’s been mobilized since last March helped prevent the U.S.\neconomy from falling o� a cli� and continues to support households and businesses. But\nCongress allocating funds is only the �rst step. Making real progress requires concentrated\nwork to raise awareness, build capacity, simplify processes and keep us marching in the\nsame direction.\nDivringi, Eileen, and Davin Reed. \"Household Rental Debt During COVID-19: Update for 2021.\"\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, March 18, 2021.\nScott, Marin. \"Going Into 2021, Renters and Landlords Are Still Hurting From COVID\nConsequences.\"Avail, March 17, 2021.\nIn a January 2021 survey, the Philadelphia Fed found that 22% of respondents had not\napplied for rental assistance because they were not sure how to and that 10% of respondents\nhad not applied because they believed there were no local programs.\n\n\f\"Advancing Racial Equity in Emergency Rental Assistance Programs,\" NYU Furman Center,\nMarch 2021.\n“COVID-19 Emergency Rental Assistance: Analysis of a National Survey of Programs,” NLIHC\nResearch Brief, January 2021.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nSmall Business\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n\f© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

It has been quite a year. Had\nI been with you a year ago, we would have been in the midst of an unprecedented\neconomic shutdown. Equity markets had just dropped 30 percent. Bond markets were in\ntrouble. Even investment grade credits were struggling to rollover their commercial paper.\nMore than 700,000 people lost their jobs last March, followed by another 20 million in April.\nOur economy was on the edge of a cli�, and no one knew what was on the other side.\nFiscal and monetary policy responded with overwhelming force. The Fed stepped up early\n\n\fand powerfully. We took our policy rates to zero in mid-March and worked to repair\n�nancial markets through our balance sheet, purchasing $1.7 trillion of Treasurys and\nmortgage-backed securities in March and April. We also relaunched a number of Great\nRecession-era emergency lending facilities to backstop speci�c bond markets.\nCongress acted decisively as well. Through multiple �scal packages, it supported those who\nlost their jobs as well as small businesses and industries at risk. To put the magnitude of\nthis �scal response in perspective, the $5.6 trillion in federal relief spending during this\ncrisis is roughly seven times the size of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\nWith this support, the economy has come most of the way back. GDP was down 2.4 percent\nin the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. Our recovery has outpaced the rest of the\nworld with the exception of Asia. Despite 9.5 million job losses, the impact of policy on the\neconomy is quite visible:\n• Aggregate disposable income has gone up, not down.\n• Households have increased their savings and paid down their credit cards.\n• Bank portfolios have remained healthy, given all the support to individuals and\nbusinesses.\n• The housing market has been strong, in part thanks to low interest rates.\n• Increased savings have fueled a shift in spending from services to goods, which has\nhelped manufacturers.\n• And the worse o� have bene�tted from stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment\nbene�ts and forbearance.\nThat said, spending has come back faster than employment. Until recently, job losses on a\npercentage basis exceeded those seen at the depths of the Great Recession. The economy\nstill has 6.2 percent fewer jobs than in February 2020.\nStill, I am hopeful that we are on the brink of completing the recovery. Vaccines are rolling\nout, and case rates and hospitalizations are falling. If I could o�er an analogy, this recovery\nis a roller coaster. Every roller coaster has a pause before the �nal plunge into the\nunknown. For our economy, winter was the pause, and the �nal stretch should be\nsomething as excess savings and �scal stimulus fund pent-up demand from consumers\nexhausted from isolation and freed by vaccines and warmer weather.\nBut as we look toward better days, it’s important we don’t lose sight of the long-standing\ndisparities the pandemic has exposed and the opportunities we now to have to invest to\naddress them. Before I say more, I have to note that the views I express are my own and\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nIn the rest of my remarks today, I want to talk about three ideas. The �rst is how this\npandemic has disrupted multiple stories we’ve been telling about the economy for the past\nfew decades. The second is how it has exacerbated many of the core challenges our\n\n\fcountry faces. And �nally, I’ll share some ideas about where we can invest to help address\nthose challenges.\nSo which stories have been upended? The �rst is a trend you might have heard called\n“hollowing out,” which refers to growth in high- and low-income jobs at the expense of\nthose in the middle. But the pandemic targeted the low-end this time: It wiped out 37\npercent of low-wage jobs between February and April. There's been some recovery, but the\nlowest-wage jobs were still down 14 percent at the end of December, while higher income\njobs were actually up.\nThe second story is the triumph of cities: In recent decades, metro areas have seen higher\npopulation and employment growth than nonmetro areas. But the pandemic hit urban\nemployment harder, especially early on, since higher population density necessitated\nearlier and longer shutdowns, and because rural employment is more likely to be in\nessential industries like agriculture and food production. Now we’re also seeing rising\nvacancy rates. People are relocating to less expensive cities, or buying homes outside the\ncenter city, and they’re not being replaced by the typical in�ux of college students and\nyoung families. And what happens to the businesses and employees that depend on\ndowntown o�ce workers if those people keep working from home?\nThe third story that’s been turned on its head is the disparate e�ect of recessions on men.\nIn the previous three recessions, especially the Great Recession, men su�ered higher\nunemployment than women, as they were disproportionately represented in industries like\nmanufacturing and construction. But the COVID-19 recession hit women’s employment\nharder, both in job loss and in labor force participation, given their industry mix and the\nchallenges of schools, child care and elder care.\nThe pandemic has also exposed — and exacerbated — some core challenges our country\nhas been struggling to address. The �rst is education. For decades, a college degree has\nbeen a dividing line: College graduates tend to earn more money, accumulate more wealth\nand have better health. And during the pandemic, it’s been the line between having a job or\nnot.\nDuring the worst of the downturn last spring, employment for people without a college\ndegree fell almost 20 percent, compared to about 6 percent for people with a degree. And\ntoday, the unemployment rate is 7.2 percent for workers with only a high school diploma\nversus 3.8 percent for those with a bachelor’s degree. The latter are back at full\nemployment.\nLooking toward tomorrow, I think there is a real risk it will get worse. Virtual learning is\nleaving students behind, especially those who were already vulnerable. We see it in the\ndata, particularly in math, and it might be even worse than it seems because many\nstudents are missing from the data due to declining public school enrollment. Research\ntells us it's hard to get back the bene�ts of early education once it's lost. Back of the\nenvelope, our economists estimate that we could see a decline of 3.8 percent in the share\n\n\fof children with a high school degree and 2.7 percent in the share with a college degree —\nwhich adds up to huge losses in the future. We already see lower community college\nenrollment, which is especially concerning because that is often the pathway back into the\njob market.\nIn short, I’m worried about losing a generation of students and what that means not only\nfor them, but also for our society as a whole. On our website, you can watch a series of\ndialogues we are having with educators from around our district. The stories are\nheartbreaking.\nThe next issue that’s been underscored is the di�culty many people have connecting to\njobs. One challenge, of course, is broadband. The crisis has illustrated just how critical\nbroadband is for school, work, e-commerce and telehealth. As recently as 2019, nearly onethird of households still had no strong broadband connection.\nAnother is transportation. The less fortunate often don’t have a reliable way to get to work,\nwhether that's because public transit doesn't connect to the available jobs or because they\ndon’t have access to a car. And now, of course, mass transit and car-sharing present health\nrisks, so even if you could take a bus to work, maybe the risk just seems too great. Declining\nridership is already leading many major transit agencies to cut service, which suggests\nconnection could be even more di�cult in the future.\nA third issue is addiction. The opioid epidemic has been a crisis for years, and the pandemic\nis making things worse, as people struggling with addiction have been cut o� from family,\nfriends, support networks and medical providers. According to the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, drug overdose deaths from June 2019 to May 2020 were the most\never recorded in a 12-month period.\nAnd there’s the issue that underpins so many others: racial inequity. The causes are\nnumerous and can be traced to our country’s painful history. The e�ects are numerous as\nwell, including higher unemployment and worse job losses during downturns, lower\neducational attainment, lower incomes, less wealth and poorer health. These have all been\nexacerbated by this crisis in ways that I fear will have long-term repercussions. For\nexample, blacks have died of COVID-19 at 1.4 times the rate of whites, and we see gaps in\nvaccinations too. Here in South Carolina, blacks make up about 26 percent of the\npopulation but only 15 percent of vaccinations. This disproportionate impact of the virus\nhas made many families of color reluctant to send their children back to in-person learning.\nThat’s a choice any parent understands, but it also means those children are at greater risk\nof falling behind.\nSo far I’ve talked about the problems. What about solutions? Where can we invest to make\nthings better? The �rst, and obvious, step is to get the virus under control. Pandemic\ndamage should be much less in a world that is able to return to normal (or something\nresembling normal) quickly rather than one in which we are still afraid to get into an\nelevator. The priority now is getting vaccines distributed and safely reopening the economy.\n\n\fThen we need to address employment. It is well worth exploring targeted support for\nprimary caregivers to return to work or to job retraining programs. This includes support\nfor child care, elder care and safely reopening schools. Employers can play a greater role,\nand we’ve seen some creative examples, like a hospital in West Virginia that’s o�ering a\nproctoring service for its employees’ children.\nIn addition, the large number of displaced personal contact service workers need help\ntransitioning to new occupations. States can open up licensing and add instructors for indemand occupations such as nursing or commercial trucking. Funding from Pell Grants and\nstate lotteries could be freed for community college certi�cate programs. Community\ncolleges can help students access wraparound services to address barriers such as housing\nand food insecurity, transportation, technology, child care and mental health.\nWe have to invest further in K-12 education. Many students need extra instruction and\ntutoring. Schools need the resources to safely teach in person so that parents feel\ncon�dent allowing their kids to return. Perhaps they need to �nd a way to leverage this\nsummer to catch up, as we heard from many educators during the second session of our\nDistrict Dialogues series.\nAnd this crisis has made it crystal clear that we need more investment in broadband. No\none should have to do their schoolwork in the parking lot of a McDonald’s, as I heard tell in\none small town. But more money isn’t the only answer. Our research has found that\nupwards of $20 billion has been allocated and not yet spent. The process is complicated\nand bureaucratic. I’m intrigued by the potential for navigational support to have a big\nimpact.\nI’ve left equity for last. In part, that’s because it is hardest to address, and in part it’s\nbecause investments in education, employment and connectivity should help us make\nprogress toward this goal. But we need to make these investments with an equity lens.\nTake vaccines, for example, a critical health lever. An equity perspective has reoriented\nlocalities toward marketing e�orts to overcome a historic lack of trust in many\ncommunities. It has led them to reexamine distribution points to ensure equal access. It\nhas led to models to reduce price as a barrier. Perhaps this method will be relevant in\nmultiple other settings.\nThe Fed is trying to do its part to limit the increase in disparities from this pandemic as well,\nthrough our new long-run policy framework. In our Fed Listens session, we heard from\ncountless people who let us know the least fortunate bene�ted from the historically strong\nlabor market in 2019. We hope to support bringing more people in from the sidelines by\nmaintaining accommodative monetary policy so long as in�ation stays moderated.\nTo close, I would reiterate that we will see damage from this downturn, as always. But we\nhave in our control the ability to limit the unique damage of this one. I hope we will.\nThanks, and now I look forward to your reactions and questions.\n\n\fThank you to Abigail Crockett and Tim Sablik for assistance preparing these remarks.\nJaison R.

Had I been with you 12 months ago, we would have been in the\nmidst of an unprecedented economic shutdown. Equity markets had just dropped 30\npercent. Bond markets were in trouble.

To put the magnitude of\nthis �scal response in perspective, the nearly $4 trillion in federal relief spending during this\ncrisis is more than four times the size of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment\nAct. And more is on the way.\nWith this support, the economy has come most of the way back. GDP was down 2.4 percent\nin the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. Our recovery has outpaced the rest of the\nworld with the exception of Asia. Despite 9.5 million job losses, the impact of policy on the\neconomy is quite visible:\n• Aggregate disposable income has gone up, not down.\n• Households have increased their savings and paid down their credit cards.\n• Bank portfolios have remained healthy, given all the support to individuals and\nbusinesses.\n• The housing market has been strong, in part thanks to low interest rates.\n• Increased savings have fueled a shift in spending from services to goods, which has\nhelped manufacturers.\n• And the worse o� have bene�tted from stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment\nbene�ts and forbearance.\nThat said, spending has come back faster than employment.

Vaccines are rolling\nout, and case rates and hospitalizations are falling. Excess savings and �scal stimulus\nshould help fund pent-up demand from consumers freed by vaccines and warmer\nweather.\nAs we look toward better days, I want to talk about the potential for scarring. Before I say\nmore, the views I express are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs my audience here knows, labor economists have something very speci�c in mind when\nthey use the term “scarring.” They are typically assessing how workers are persistently\nimpacted by a downturn. For example, those who graduate in a recession may start work at\nlower wages than cohorts who start their careers in an expansion, depressing their\n\n\fearnings for years. Those who lose their jobs during a recession can struggle to get rehired\nafter a lengthy period of unemployment.\nThe idea of hysteresis is related to scarring. It proposes that temporary shocks can have\npermanent e�ects on economic growth. But it can be hard to see the lasting impact of\ndemand shocks when looking at the economy as a whole. One of the Richmond Fed’s\neconomists has documented that in a recent paper. He and his co-author �nd no evidence\nof permanent damage to U.S. GDP from demand shocks over the last 60 years.\nStill, I believe that severe downturns can leave scars that, while not always permanent, take\na long time to heal. After the Great Recession, in regions that saw the biggest drop in\nhousing prices, employment remained at 2009 trough levels as late as 2018 and only\nrecovered because unemployed workers moved to seek opportunities elsewhere. Similarly,\nthe decline in manufacturing employment during the 2000s also resulted in a long period of\nelevated market detachment for less-educated, prime-age workers, particularly in the Rust\nBelt. While we did ultimately build toward a robust labor market, it took a decade after the\nGreat Recession ended to get there.\n\nThis time, we’ve had a sharper drop but also a quicker recovery. Perhaps we will see less\ndamage from long-term unemployment than during the Great Recession. Job losses this\ntime have also been heavily concentrated in high turnover occupations, such as\nhousekeepers and waiters. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, these workers changed\njobs regularly. Workers displaced in these jobs may be able to more quickly transition to\njobs in similar industries, spending less time out of the labor market.\nThe increase in teleworking could also improve matching between workers and jobs\nrelative to what we saw in the last recession. Instead of becoming isolated in towns with\nfew opportunities, job seekers may be able to �nd new employment elsewhere, provided\nthey have the right skills and a reliable broadband connection.\nDespite these positives, I still worry we will see scarring, albeit in new places. COVID-19 has\nhit primary caregivers particularly hard. School and child care closures have put pressure\non parents. The data suggest that this pressure initially fell disproportionately on women.\nDespite some recovery, labor force participation for parents remains about 6 percentage\npoints below where it was prior to the pandemic. If parents who left the workforce don’t\nreturn, that would have long-term negative implications for our growth potential.\nSpeaking of schools, we also face potentially huge losses in human capital from the shift to\nremote education. The Richmond Fed has launched a six-part series on this topic, which\nyou might want to view. We know from decades of research that learning builds on itself.\nThat means that disruptions to schooling are likely to have lifelong consequences. In the\nFifth District, students outside of the suburbs are less likely to have access to computers\nand fast broadband at home, greatly impeding their ability to learn remotely. Students in\nlow-income neighborhoods are more likely to su�er persistent negative e�ects from the\n\n\fshift to remote learning, further widening the education gap that existed before the\npandemic.\nThe pandemic has also accelerated automation, boosting demand for contactless\ntechnology, online retail and telemedicine. As a result, we could see less demand for the\nlow-skill, personal contact jobs that today have higher unemployment. A recent paper\nsuggests that women may also be more exposed to this risk than men.\nOn the business side, this recession, like most, hit small businesses hardest. Larger\nbusinesses generally had the resources to navigate the pandemic. With fewer small\nbusinesses, we risk missing out on the game-changing productivity gains they often\ndeliver.\nTaking an even broader view of scarring, the pandemic has placed a unique strain on cities.\nMany people who used to work in downtown o�ces are home. City residents are afraid to\nget into crowded subways and elevators. City amenities (like theaters) are closed. History\nhas shown us that cities are incredibly resilient, having survived countless wars and\nplagues. So they might well recover. But there are already signs of migration from\ndowntowns to surrounding suburbs in the largest cities. If this shifts commerce from\ndowntown to the suburbs, what will that mean for the many service sector businesses and\nworkers in city centers? We risk scarring our urban platforms of collaboration and\ninnovation.\nThe pandemic also has strained our country’s �nances. On the policy side, the aggressive\n�scal response helped support a quicker recovery. But it has also fueled a record increase\nin federal debt: over $4 trillion last year. While there are no immediate signs of a U.S. debt\ncrisis, we should be wary of diminishing our �scal capacity to respond aggressively to the\nnext crisis. Europe’s overall �scal response to the current crisis has generally been smaller\nthan the United States’, and one could argue that has held their economies back.\n\nThe �rst, and obvious, step is to get the virus under control. Scarring—of workers,\nbusinesses and communities—should be much less in a world that is able to return to\nnormal (or something resembling normal) quickly versus one in which we are still afraid to\nget into an elevator. The priority now is getting vaccines distributed and safely reopening\nthe economy.\nIt is also well worth exploring targeted support for workers a�ected by this crisis. We\nshould pay special attention to programs that allow primary caregivers to return to work.\nThis includes support for child care, elder care and safely reopening schools. Research also\nsuggests that policies like the Earned Income Tax Credit can promote work and the\naccumulation of human capital.\nIn addition, the large number of displaced personal contact service workers need help\ntransitioning to new occupations. States can open up licensing and add instructors for indemand occupations such as nursing or commercial trucking. Funding from Pell Grants and\n\n\fstate lotteries could be freed for community college certi�cate programs.\nWe have to invest further in education. We’ve heard from educators throughout our district\nthat students are falling behind because of remote learning. And while schools are starting\nto reopen, many parents remain fearful of sending their children back. This is especially\ntrue for families of color, who have been so disproportionately harmed by the pandemic.\nMany students will need extra instruction and tutoring. Schools need the resources to\nsafely teach in person, so that parents feel con�dent allowing their kids to return. Perhaps\nthey need to �nd a way to leverage this summer to catch students up. Support for\neducation could help prevent temporary disruptions from turning into permanent scars.\nOn the business side, we will undoubtedly see sectors shrink and sectors grow. That is\nnatural. Now, on the other side of the pandemic, the objective may be less about support\nand more about letting market forces work. Preventing scarring may require taking special\ncare not to hinder the creation of the companies of tomorrow when trying to protect the\ncompanies of today.\nAs someone focused on the rural-urban divide for years, I might call out that small towns\nand inner cities face a common challenge: the lack of a�ordable broadband. This crisis has\ncrystallized the case for its universal deployment, and doing so may be the greatest lever\nfor revitalizing the residential part of inner cities and making small towns competitive in the\npursuit of jobs and talent. Our Bank has made this a research area of focus as well.\nAs I discussed at the beginning, �scal support has been critical to getting us on the path to\nrecovery. Once the economy is on stable footing again, it will be important to take steps to\nget our �scal house in order so we have the capacity to limit scarring the next time we have\na downturn. With the crisis behind us, we need to �nd the political will to bring our de�cits\nto sustainable levels. At the moment, the United States still seems to have �scal capacity.\nBut that is always the case until it isn’t.\nThe Fed is trying to do its part to limit scarring as well, through our new long-run policy\nframework. In our Fed Listens session, we heard from countless people who let us know\nthe least fortunate bene�ted from the historically strong labor market in 2019. We hope to\nsupport bringing more people in from the sidelines by maintaining accommodative\nmonetary policy so long as in�ation stays moderated.\nTo close, I would just reiterate that we will see scarring from this downturn, as always. But\nwe have in our control the ability to limit the unique damage of this one. I hope we will.\nThanks, and now I will open up to questions.\nThank you to Tim Sablik for assistance preparing these remarks.\nBenati, Luca, and Thomas A.

We need investment in our country’s infrastructure. Our roads and bridges are\nlong overdue for repairs. We lag behind other countries in high-speed transit and the shift\nto renewable energy. We have far too many schools and hospitals that need updating. And\ntoo many students in small towns and inner cities have been set back by their lack of\nbroadband, worsening the educational disparities that existed even before the COVID-19\npandemic.\nSupporters of a large infrastructure bill also point to the potential to create millions of jobs\n—a critical priority, given there are currently 9.6 million fewer jobs in our economy than\nthere were a year ago. Jobs were also the focus of the 2009 infrastructure bill, passed at a\ntime when the housing market had crumbled, the rust belt was in turmoil, and millions of\nmanufacturing and construction workers were on the streets. But are the people who are\nout of work today the same ones ready and able to work as wind turbine technicians,\ncement masons, or �ber optic line workers?\nIn the near term, the answer is probably no.\nThe U.S. economy doesn’t have enough production workers or skilled tradespeople. That\nwas true before the pandemic, and it remains true today. As I talk with community and\nbusiness leaders throughout the Richmond Fed’s Fifth District, this is a constant refrain. In\nHickory, N.C., furniture manufacturers are struggling to hire enough sta� to meet demand.\nIn South Carolina’s PeeDee region, I’ve heard from companies that can’t �nd enough\nwelders and maintenance technicians. With the housing market so robust, carpenters,\nplumbers and electricians are scarce. Truckers are hard to �nd anywhere.\nThat’s a big shift from the last downturn. This time, home construction and renovation are\nbooming. Many manufacturers are prospering, as consumers spend money they would\nhave spent on travel or restaurants on appliances and patio furniture.\nThis time, the unemployed are disproportionally personal contact service workers like\n\n\frestaurant servers, retail clerks and housekeepers. These jobs require a very di�erent skill\nset and occur in a very di�erent environment than manufacturing and construction jobs.\nIt’s easy to see why someone would be unable—or unwilling—to move from waiting tables\nin an urban restaurant to working the third shift at a manufacturing plant far outside the\ncity. And one can imagine why someone would hesitate to take the time to acquire the skills\nthey need for such work. Maybe they’re getting by on the support they’ve received from\n�scal and forbearance programs, have reduced their own spending, and are hoping that\nthe proximity of a vaccine will bring back their former jobs. Maybe they are worried\ninfrastructure jobs won’t last beyond the pandemic, or beyond the coming legislation.\nIn so many ways, including racial inequality, educational attainment and child care, the\npandemic has laid bare preexisting problems. And we see it again: We have to recognize\nthat we have underinvested in our infrastructure workforce as much as we have\nunderinvested in infrastructure. Companies have cut back on training. Schools have cut\nback on technical pathways. Parents and guidance counselors, aware that many of these\nsectors have been challenged, have been pointing students elsewhere. The decline in\nimmigration has reduced the number of �rst generation skilled tradespeople.\nWe need to address this underinvestment. The coming infrastructure bill needs to include\nfunding for signi�cant e�orts to create more infrastructure workers. It should also focus its\ninvestments in areas where employment can be sustained once the stimulus spending has\nbeen completed. Examples of initiatives that could make a di�erence include:\n. For example, students can’t\n\n•\n\nuse Pell Grants to pay for workforce training or credential programs. The same is true\nfor many state scholarship programs funded by lotteries. But certi�cate programs,\ngenerally o�ered at community colleges, are a relatively low-cost way to quickly train\nthe next generation of infrastructure workers—we need to make it easier for students\nto pay for them and for community colleges to o�er them. I was encouraged by\nVirginia’s recent move to use $30 million in CARES Act funding to provide scholarships\nfor credential programs in high-demand �elds such as skilled trades.\n. While a growing number of employers have\n\n•\n\ndeveloped apprenticeship programs in recent years, they are still relatively rare in the\nUnited States. But they o�er numerous bene�ts to both workers and employers, as\nFifth District �rms such as Rolls-Royce Crosspointe, Bosch and BMW have found.\n. Not only can these\n\n•\n\nworkers help us deliver on necessary infrastructure projects, but they can also help us\ngrow our workforce—and thus our economy—at a time when demographic trends are\notherwise working against us.\n•\n\n. For example, even before the pandemic, many states\nwere facing training and testing backlogs for commercial drivers, a relatively wellpaying occupation for a worker without a college degree. The closure or limited hours\nof state motor vehicle departments has only made the problem worse.\n\n\fThese are only a few of the possible levers, and the solutions may di�er by state or by the\nneeded skills. But for our country to get the full bene�t of an increased investment in\ninfrastructure, we need to fully take on—in concert—an increased investment in our\nworkforce.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nProduction and Investment\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nFiscal Policy\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2021\n\nAs the COVID-19 vaccine rolls out across the United States, it �nally seems timely to think\nabout the economy getting back to “normal.” But what will normal be in an o�ce\nenvironment? The answer doesn’t just matter for individuals and companies—it has\nimplications for our future labor force.\nMany workers who have been able to do their jobs from home feel they have been every\nbit as productive as they were in the o�ce, with the added bonus of reduced commuting\ncosts and less time away from family. (Many people, of course, have not been so fortunate\nas to work from home, as I discussed in an essay last spring.) At the same time, employers\n(and employees) may feel that remote work limits their ability to build culture, provide realtime mentoring, and foster innovation. Those of us who love our “work families” miss those\nconnections and don’t want that social fabric to fray.\nMost �rms are exploring a more �exible “hybrid” model that combines in-person and\nremote work. On the surface, it should work—after all, we already knew how to operate in\nperson, and now we know how to manage virtually. But combining them presents a whole\nnew set of questions.\nTo illustrate, remember what it was like to be in a group meeting with only one or two\npeople on the phone or on video. Which relationships are being reinforced in casual\nconversations before the meeting? Are the people in the room, who can read the subtle\ncues of body language in real time, able to dominate the discussion? What stories are being\ntold in the halls after the o�cial meeting is over? Longer term, do opportunities get\ndisproportionately allocated to the people who are present and therefore “top of mind”?\nDo the people who remain onsite forget about—or even resent—those who are home?\nMany salespeople have been able to work from home successfully. But this is a time when\neveryone is remote and customers are discouraging in-person contact. How will a\nsalesperson (or sales manager) react the �rst time a customer chooses a competitor who\nwas physically present building a relationship? On the �ip side, if he or she wants to travel\n\n\fto renew relationships at an industry conference, what will the “lower-travel” hybrid model\npermit?\nHow robust are human resource policies to a hybrid model? If a company pays di�erently\nby location, how will it handle employees working remotely from lower-cost cities? If a\ncompany values its employees living locally, how will it enforce that? Will remote employees\nbuild the personal relationships that make them loyal to their employer? Could they be\npoached by employers in higher-wage locations?\nAnd what does all this mean for o�ce space—not to mention for the many servicepeople\nwhose livelihoods depend on the concentration of o�ce workers?\nCompanies still have a lot to �gure out. Drawing on conversations with executives across\nthe Richmond Fed’s Fifth District and my own experience, I o�er a few suggestions.\nFirst, companies will need to explicitly de�ne and communicate the value proposition of inperson work—and then make that value proposition a reality. This means balancing (or\nrebalancing) the interests of the institution and its people. It means creating a positive\nenvironment for people to enhance their skills and advance their careers. It means\ninspiring people with connectivity, innovation and development, and translating these\nelements into the company’s objectives.\nSecond, they need to make the rules of the road clear. What is the minimum in-person\nrequirement? What can employees expect of one another? Most of the major consulting\n�rms, who operate largely remote workforces, have found that mandating certain days\n(e.g., every Friday) in the o�ce is critical to building networks and culture. That can require\nexplicit investment—the same consulting �rms also �nd it valuable to program those days\nto ensure that employees attend and �nd their time well spent.\nThird, onboarding and integration will need a rethink. With fewer co-workers on site, the\nchallenge of inculcating new employees into a company’s culture increases. Companies\nmay need to think much more tactically about assimilation and development, for example\nby investing in personal training or assigning mentors and sponsors.\nFourth, a remote connectivity model needs its own set of management practices.\nCompanies with experience in hybrid models operate di�erently. During meetings, they\nexplicitly ask for input from those not in the room. They use pulse surveys to stay attuned\nto morale. Managers reach out proactively rather than waiting for someone to wander into\ntheir o�ce. Teams commit to rituals, such as meals or regular check-ins, to stay connected.\nFinally, all must accept that not every job can be done the same way. Relationship-oriented\nsalespeople may need to be in front of customers, while subject matter experts may be\nable to get more done remotely. Some managers may need to be on-site, while others\ndon’t.\nInvestments in connectivity and training can be costly. But there are huge potential savings\non real estate that could be reinvested in the networks that make the “work family”\n\n\ffunctional.\nA move to hybrid could have meaningful ripple e�ects on the economy. The more �exible\narrangements that come with hybrid could bring more people into the workforce and help\no�set the recent slowdown in women’s labor force participation. Job matching could\nimprove as well, as opportunities open beyond one’s current geography and individuals\n�nd a broader market for their skills. Two-career couples may �nd new opportunities easier\nto navigate. The ability of people to live anywhere could help spur investment in\nbroadband in areas that have struggled to connect.\nAccess to the broader pool of remote talent should also a�ect wages, as suggested earlier.\nIt could relieve wage pressure in the highest-cost cities, more than o�setting wage\nincreases in lower-cost communities. This is very much in line with economic theory on the\ne�ects of declining trade barriers.\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, home and work were deeply intertwined. Then, with the\nrise of factories and o�ces, we separated work from home. Living standards improved and\neconomic growth accelerated. But did we lose anything when we made our personal lives\nso separate from our “work”? Does modern technology mean we can have the best of both?\nI don’t know the answer to that question. But a �exible, hybrid work model is coming. We\nhave a lot to learn about it—and a lot of opportunities to look forward to.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nProduction and Investment\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

Visit the event page to learn more and register.\nSince last March, when schools started shutting down and transitioning to remote learning,\nwe’ve been worried about students losing touch with the educational system. Those\nconcerns now appear to have been well founded. While we don’t yet have data at the\nnational level, most states have reported declining public school enrollment in the fall of\n2020. In addition, students who are enrolled may be less engaged, and we’ve also seen a\ndecline in the number of students making the important jump from high school to college:\nThe pipeline to higher education, and thus to the workforce, is leaking.\nHere in Virginia, for example, 45,000 fewer students were enrolled in public school than in\nthe fall of 2019, a 3.5 percent drop. (Declines have been similar in other states in our\nDistrict.) More than 18,000 of those students—40 percent—would have been in pre-K or\nkindergarten. This could re�ect parents opting for other schooling options, such as private\nschool or home school, or deciding to delay kindergarten enrollment for a year. But it may\nbe that some kids are missing out on a necessary year of school altogether. This decline in\nour youngest students is especially concerning, as we know from a large body of research\nthat early learning is critical to lay the foundation for education later in life. And in Virginia,\npublic pre-K is available to children from low-income families or to children who have\nspecial needs—the same children who may have di�culty accessing other schooling\noptions.\nOther data also suggest that students are less engaged in learning than they were prior to\nthe pandemic, particularly low-income students. Economists at Harvard University’s\nOpportunity Insights have been tracking students’ participation in a widely used online\nmath course that is typically paired with classroom instruction. Nationwide, between\nJanuary and December 2020, this participation declined 20 percent for low-income students\ncompared to just 2 percent for high-income students.\n\n\fIn a recent national survey, teachers and educators from pre-K to 12th grade reported that\nthey expect 16 percent of their students to receive failing grades at the end of this\nsemester, compared to 9 percent a year ago. There’s a large gap in expectations according\nto income—21 percent of students in high-poverty schools were expected to fail, versus 8\npercent in lower-poverty schools.\nThese expectations have already become reality in Chester�eld County, just outside\nRichmond. In 2020, more than 17 percent of the county’s high school students, and 12\npercent of middle school students, failed at least two courses. In 2019, the shares were 9.2\npercent and 4.8 percent.\nThe increase in students feeling disengaged from school could be contributing to the\ndecline in students enrolling in college. Last fall, the number of students who transitioned\ndirectly from high school to college fell 22 percent compared to the fall of 2019—and once\nagain, the decline has disproportionately been among students from lower-income\nbackgrounds. At low-income and high-poverty schools, around 30 percent fewer students\nwent to college right after high school graduation, compared to about 17 percent fewer\nstudents from high-income and low-poverty schools.\nWhile enrollment declined across all institution types, community college enrollment has\nbeen hit particularly hard. Direct-from-high-school enrollment fell more than 30 percent at\ncommunity colleges, compared to 14 percent at public four-year colleges. And community\ncollege enrollment by students of all ages fell 10 percent, compared to 2.5 percent for\ncolleges overall. The drop has been especially large in �elds where we hear from employers\nthat they’re having trouble �nding workers, such as precision manufacturing and the skilled\nconstruction trades. This is particularly troubling because community colleges are the �rst\ncollege experience for many low-income students, and can be a stepping stone to a fouryear degree—and the higher earnings that come with it. Community colleges also provide\nthe skills people need to land good jobs, including certi�cate programs that can deliver new\nskills in a relatively short period of time.\nSome of these students may eventually enroll—but research suggests that if students don’t\nstart college right out of high school, they are much less likely to ever go back. It is crucial\nthat we not lose focus on the impact this pandemic is having—and will continue to have—\non our nation’s students.\nWill that impact continue to fall most heavily on students from disadvantaged backgrounds\n—and if yes, what are the long-term consequences? What are the downstream e�ects for\nour future workforce and economy? And what will be the implications of looming state\nbudget de�cits on already-stretched education budgets? What solutions can shore up our\npost-COVID pipeline to the workforce?\nTo address some of these questions, the Richmond Fed is hosting a series of six\nconversations with economists, educators and policymakers about the challenges facing\nstudents and schools, and innovative solutions —inside the classroom, outside the\n\n\fclassroom and in transition to the workforce.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2020\n\nIn February, more than 61 percent of the U.S. population was working—the largest share\nsince the Great Recession. In April, the share dropped almost 10 percentage points, to 51.3\npercent, with even larger declines for younger workers, women, minorities, and people with\nless education. While there has been steady recovery, in October the employment-topopulation ratio was still 3.7 percentage points lower than before the pandemic. There are\n9 million fewer people employed today than in February.\nWith so many people looking for work, how is it possible that so many employers tell us\nthey are struggling to �nd workers? In October, a survey by the National Federation of\nIndependent Businesses found 33 percent of small-business owners couldn’t �ll current\nopenings. In addition, almost 90 percent of the businesses that were trying to hire (55\npercent of all the businesses surveyed) reported having a hard time �nding quali�ed\napplicants for their openings. In our own Fifth District surveys of the manufacturing and\nservice sectors, �rms also report that it’s di�cult to �nd workers with the necessary skills.\nClearly, there are frictions in the labor market that are preventing the people who are\nlooking for work from connecting with employers who are looking for workers. One friction\nmight be skill mismatch—a displaced waiter can’t get a new job as a nurse or in\nconstruction overnight. And some workers might not be interested in switching to new\nindustries right now. Starting over in a new �eld takes time, can cost money, can feel like\ntaking a step back, and may be uncomfortable for someone who enjoyed what they were\ndoing.\nThere is geographic mismatch as well. For example, we’ve heard from furniture\nmanufacturers in Hickory, N.C, that are overwhelmed. But the great majority of those who\nhave been laid o� are in bigger cities with signi�cant leisure and hospitality sectors. Are\nthey ready to move to a smaller town?\nIn the context of these mismatches, I am distressed by the current drop in community\n\n\fcollege enrollment. Community colleges serve those who have been hit hardest by recent\njob loss: women, minorities, and young people. They are the �rst college experience for\nmany low-income students. Community colleges provide the skills people need to land\ngood jobs and can connect students to employers. They also o�er certi�cate programs that\ncan deliver new skills in a relatively short period of time.\nBut enrollment is way down. Relative to last fall, undergraduate enrollment is down 9.4\npercent at public two-year schools, compared with only 1.4 percent at public four-year\nschools. First-time student enrollment at community colleges fell by 22.7 percent.\nEnrollment is down more for black and Hispanic men than for white men and more for\nblack women than white women.\nWhy is this? In conversations with community college presidents around the Fifth District,\nwe’ve heard several key themes.\nThe �rst is uncertainty—what will the virus do this fall and winter? Will the businesses that\nhave closed their doors be able to reopen? Will the jobs come back? All this uncertainty\nmakes it tough to commit to a plan for the future.\nAnother theme is child care. Many presidents told us that their typical female student is a\nsingle or working mother. With kids at home in virtual school, these women aren’t coming\nin the door.\nCost may also be an issue; about 80 percent of community college students work, but the\nloss of service sector jobs could be limiting their ability to fund their schooling. And while\nthere are a variety of resources available to help—presidents by and large say they can “�ll\nthe gap” for just about any student—potential students who are unfamiliar with the\n�nancial aid process might not know those resources are out there or how to apply for\nthem.\nFinally, particularly for students who just graduated from high school, decisions about the\nfollowing year were being made last spring, at the height of the pandemic. It’s easy to\nimagine that in the midst of the shutdown, decisions were delayed and counseling\nopportunities were missed. And many of these students may not be attracted to remote\nlearning. But research shows that if students don’t start college right out of high school,\nthey are much less likely to ever go back.\nSo how can we help people make the investments in themselves that will lead to long-term\ninclusive growth?\nFirst, businesses can invest through partnerships to fund community college programs that\nteach the skills they need. We’ve seen a number of successful examples of this in our\ndistrict. It’s a win for the student, who gets connected to a job, and for the employer, who\ngets a skilled worker at a time when they remain scarce.\nStates can invest by directing funding to where it’s needed most. Here in Virginia, for\nexample, $30 million in CARES Act funding is being used to provide scholarships for\n\n\fworkers who were displaced by COVID-19. They can use the money for workforce\ncredential or community college programs in high-demand �elds such as health care,\nskilled trades, and early childhood education.\nSchools can invest in making online education work. For example, Germanna Community\nCollege, part of the Northern Virginia Community College system, moved very quickly to put\neverything online, including all student services. Their enrollment is actually up this fall;\nstudents knew relatively early on what to expect. And Germanna has been intentional\nabout making sure students have access to wraparound services in partnership with\ncommunity-based organizations. This lets them address what can be some of the most\ndi�cult barriers to education: housing and food insecurity, transportation, technology,\nchild care, and mental health. This program—Germanna Cares—has helped their students\nconnect with $140,000 in bene�ts, both internal and external.\nCommunities can also invest more in getting information out to high school students about\nthe application and �nancial aid processes. Many high school guidance programs were\nalready stretched thin, and the pandemic can only be making funding and student access\nmore challenging—so perhaps state or local educators could create and market guides to\nentrance exams, FAFSA, and the like.\nThe pandemic has disproportionately a�ected a number of lower-income service sector\nworkers. At the same time, employers in industries like health care and manufacturing are\nshort sta�ed. Community colleges play a critical connecting role in making the labor market\nfunction. It’s important we address the barriers to leveraging them fully.\n\nWorkforce Development\n\nEducation\n\nCommunity Colleges\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\n\fEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2020\n\nOne notable feature of the COVID-19 downturn has been an extraordinary rise in the\npersonal saving rate. It spiked to historic levels, from 8.3 percent in February to 33.6\npercent in April. While it has come down since then, it is still elevated, at 14.1 percent as of\nAugust. That’s $1.1 trillion extra in people’s pockets at a time when the economy, and\nmillions of workers, are struggling.\nWhy have savings increased so dramatically? First, the shutdown of the economy meant\ncertain forms of spending were largely unavailable. Even if they had wanted to, consumers\ncouldn’t buy haircuts, elective surgeries or international vacations. Second, both job loss\nand concern over health risks created tremendous uncertainty. Consumers may well have\nchosen to save more money to help bridge to an uncertain future. Net, consumer spending\ndropped 6.1 percent from March to August versus the same period a year ago. We also saw\na signi�cant reduction of outstanding credit card balances.\nAt the same time, consumers received extraordinary levels of government stimulus.\nBetween March and August, at least $712 billion �owed into personal income as a result of\nCOVID-19-related stimulus measures, including direct payments, enhanced unemployment\ninsurance and PPP income to proprietors. These �ows helped o�set lost wages for\nfurloughed and laid-o� workers and lost revenue for small businesses that had to close\ntemporarily. In April, when many economic impact payments were disbursed, total\npersonal income grew 14.1 percent year over year, compared to an average of 3.9 percent\nyear-over-year growth in January and February.\nWhen stimulus boosts income at the same time spending drops, naturally savings will rise.\nBut the e�ects were uneven. The less fortunate received the great majority of the stimulus\npayments, but they tend to spend a greater percentage of what they make, as they are\nmore likely to live paycheck to paycheck. Researchers found that, in April, the top income\nquartile accounted for 40 percent of the decline in consumer spending, and high-income\nspending has still not recovered. In contrast, as of September, low-income spending is\nexceeding pre-crisis levels.\n\n\fAs the saving rate grew, we also saw a signi�cant shift in spending from services to goods.\nAs of August, spending on goods was up 5.8 percent from a year ago, and sectors like\nresidential, automotive and recreational equipment were booming. But with continuing\nhealth concerns and capacity limitations, services spending is still down 7.2 percent from a\nyear ago. This is challenging the travel, restaurant and entertainment sectors, among\nothers.\nWill these increased savings, combined with pent-up demand, fuel consumption that can\nsupport the recovery in the coming months? No other spike on record matches the\nintensity of the current saving rate increase, but there is one other period in which we saw\nit increase dramatically — during World War II. Right before World War II, the personal\nsaving rate averaged 5 percent. During the war it climbed upward, peaking in 1944 at 27.9\npercent, then dropped rapidly. It fell to a three-year average of 7.4 percent from 1947 to\n1949. Similar to today, government-imposed restrictions on consumption (both rations and\nthe redirection of resources to the war e�ort) decreased consumer spending. After the war,\npent-up demand lifted the recovery: $24.2 billion was added to consumer spending\nbetween 1945 and 1946.\nCould something like this happen again? If we get a vaccine or compelling virus treatment,\ncould we see a trillion-dollar boost to the economy?\nEconomic theory suggests we temper our optimism. There is a lot of research on how\npeople behave after they receive windfalls. Asset-driven wealth, such as home price\nappreciation or stock market growth, doesn’t appear to increase spending very much,\nperhaps because those gains tend to be concentrated among those already wealthy and\ncan be costly to liquidate. Tax transfers often increase spending more, especially for those\nat lower incomes, but the marginal propensity to consume tax windfalls is still only in the\nrange of 40 percent. And, as I noted earlier, uncertainty matters. People tend to spend\ngradually to retirement and the higher the uncertainty, the higher the propensity to save.\nWhat does all of this mean for today? With service sector capacity still constrained, we\nshould expect any spending to continue to focus on goods. That may mean a healthy\nholiday season. With additional stimulus not yet forthcoming, we should expect lowerincome families to tap the savings they accrued through the stimulus. And if we get a\nvaccine, one has to imagine that higher-income individuals will want to take a trip or at\nleast go out to a nice dinner.\nAt the same time, we know that the wealthy are less likely to spend their savings, and one\nonly has so many vacation days. In addition, service sector spending is historically steadier\nthan spending on goods — missed haircuts or dental appointments or business trips are\nunlikely to be made up. In a recent Gallup poll, among Americans who are currently able to\nsave money, 76 percent plan to keep adding to their savings in the next six months. So,\nwhile some resurgence is likely, it may well look a lot more like a steady path back to\nnormal than like the celebration of V-J Day.\n\n\fChetty, Raj, John N.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2020\n\nEconomic Club of New York\n\n• Firms are currently navigating extraordinary uncertainty. The decisions they make\nabout hiring, spending and investment will have implications for GDP growth,\nemployment and in�ation.\n• Business sentiment surveys like The CFO Survey help us understand those decisions.\n• The latest survey shows that CFOs are feeling slightly more optimistic than they were\nlast quarter, although they remain concerned about demand and revenue. Firms\nalso remain cautious about investing.\n• The survey also suggests that employment will lag spending. Many �rms have\nstreamlined their operations in response to the pandemic, and others report that\nthey are concerned about the “availability and quality of labor” despite high\nunemployment.\n• CFOs also raised their expectations for wage and price increases in 2021, potentially\ndue to supply chain challenges. If demand were to resurge, we could see pressure on\nnear-term pricing.\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you this afternoon (virtually). I thought today I would share\nsome perspectives on where the economy is and what I look at in thinking about where it\nmight be headed, though I’m very much looking forward to hearing your questions and\ncomments. Before I say more, I have to note that the views I express are my own and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nMy experience is di�erent than most of those colleagues. Before coming to the Fed nearly\nthree years ago, I was the chief �nancial o�cer (CFO) of a $10 billion institution. As I\n\n\fconsider the path of the economy, I go back to that experience a lot and try to put myself in\nthe shoes of a �rm navigating what has been, and still is, extraordinary uncertainty —\naround the virus, around �scal policy and around politics. Earlier this spring, in the\nimmediate wake of the shutdown, I of course would have been thoughtful on hiring and\nspending. But now, in the midst of developing a budget for next year, how aggressive or\nconservative would I be on hiring? Or spending? Or capital investments? Would I be pushing\nto implement a normal January price increase? Would I be stocking the shelves for a strong\nholiday rebound or trimming inventories to be prudent? Would I be shifting my supply\nchain out of certain countries? How �rms answer these questions has implications for GDP\ngrowth, employment and the pace of in�ation.\nBut I wear a di�erent hat now. To understand how and what �rms are deciding, I’ve been\nhelped greatly by my continual outreach in our district, which spans from Maryland to the\nCarolinas, and by keeping an eye on business sentiment surveys, particularly the Richmond\nand Atlanta Fed’s partnership with Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business on The CFO\nSurvey. This quarterly survey has tracked business sentiment for nearly 25 years, surveying\nCFOs and �nancial decision-makers across �rms of all sizes and in all major industries. It\ngathers their views on the health of their own �rms and of the overall economy. It delves\ninto their expectations for hiring, spending, investment and pricing in real time, which is\nparticularly important given the pace of change during the current economic crisis.\nWe released the results of the latest survey last week. What did it tell us about prospects\nfor the economy?\nFirst, CFOs’ expectations are brightening, albeit gradually. Looking at the headline Optimism\nIndex, CFOs are slightly more optimistic about the U.S. economy and their own company’s\nprospects since our last survey in July. At that time, they estimated GDP growth over the\nnext four quarters would be just 0.6 percent. They anticipate 2.2 percent now. Their\nexpectations for their own revenue growth in 2021 have grown from 7.2 percent to 8.7\npercent.\nFirms are still worried about demand and revenue but a little less so than in the last\nquarter. In the open text question that asked about �rms’ most pressing concerns, the\nshare that cited �agging demand and declining sales revenue was notably lower. Of course,\n“slightly more optimistic about revenue returning” doesn’t necessarily mean that revenue\ngrowth will be quick. Only about 20 percent of �rms that responded anticipated being at\npre-COVID-19 levels of revenue any time before the middle of 2021.\nThis matches what I hear in conversations every week with business executives. In sectors\nthat have largely reopened, executives tell me they have found a way to operate safely. And\nwith the personal saving rate still elevated — at 26 percent in the second quarter and 14.1\npercent in August, compared to the pre-crisis level of around 8.3 percent — executives see\nsigni�cant consumer spending potential that could bolster demand.\n\n\fSecond, we heard that �rms still remain cautious about investing. More than 50 percent of\n�rms reported a decreased willingness to spend compared to pre-COVID-19. Only about\none-third of CFOs had plans to invest in structures over the next six months. And while\nmore than 60 percent were planning to invest in equipment, most reported investing for\nmaintenance. Those who are not investing primarily cited the uncertainty of the economy\nand a need to preserve cash. This sense of caution is natural given the breadth of potential\npaths for the virus, for the government response and consequently, for the economy. This\nuncertainty e�ectively increases discount rates.\nThird, CFOs believe employment is likely to lag spending. In July, they expected a 4.2\npercent increase in 2021 employment. That has dropped to 2.2 percent despite their\nincreased optimism on revenue. Most businesses, even those less a�ected by the virus, tell\nme they have taken the opportunity to streamline their operations. A number of sectors,\nsuch as food services, are still operating at less than full capacity. And you’ve seen recently\na number of sizable layo� announcements from airlines, theme park operators and even a\nmajor insurer.\nAt the same time, hiring is a challenge. Despite the fact that unemployment remains quite\nelevated at 7.9 percent, there was a large increase in the share of survey respondents citing\nthe “availability and quality of labor” as a pressing concern. This mirrors what I hear in my\ninterviews, particularly in sectors like manufacturing, technology and healthcare. Many of\nthe people who lost their jobs don’t yet have the skills to �nd employment in a di�erent\n�eld. And, at a time when many schools, child care centers and elder care facilities are\nclosed or struggling, we are seeing drops in labor force participation, particularly for primeage women.\nFinally, the CFOs in the survey see price pressure as increasingly tangible. Their\nexpectations for 2021 wage increases have escalated from 4.4 percent to 5.4 percent, and\ntheir expected price increases rose from 2.9 percent to 4.3 percent. I don’t take a lot of\nsignal from the numbers themselves, but the directionality does support my view that\nsupply chain challenges amidst all this uncertainty could put pressure on certain prices. We\nsaw that with food over the summer and with lumber more recently. When I go to big-box\nretailers, the shelves look a bit bare. If demand were to resurge, say because of a successful\nvaccine, while supply chains are still stretched, we could see pressure on near-term pricing.\nSpeaking of pricing, the FOMC recently announced changes to its 2012 statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. We’ve said that in order to anchor in�ation\nexpectations at 2 percent, the Committee seeks to achieve in�ation that averages 2 percent\nover time. As you know, it has modestly lagged that target for some time. In his speech\nannouncing the changes, Chair Powell called this �exible average in�ation targeting — the\n�exibility coming from the lack of a speci�c formula. In addition, the Committee said that it\nwill respond to shortfalls of employment from its maximum level; the previous version\nreferenced deviations of employment. In other words, under the new framework, a low\nlevel of unemployment alone would not lead to preemptive increases in interest rates.\n\n\fFinally, the Committee made explicit that meeting our mandate requires a stable �nancial\nsystem.\nThe net of all this is a message that the Fed will aim to keep rates low until we see\nmoderate overshoots of in�ation or the development of �nancial stability risks. Our\nstatement last month reinforced that message, which was supported by our projections in\nwhich the median respondent didn’t have a rate increase through 2023. We also continue\nto engage in signi�cant bond purchases that provide additional accommodation.\nI remain hopeful that we can put this virus and the related uncertainty behind us. If we can,\nthere is untapped consumption that could give the economy a real lift. My hope then is that\nreduced uncertainty could get CFOs o� the sidelines and propel the virtuous cycle of hiring\nand investment that moves the economy forward. In the interim, the Fed continues to do\nwhat it can to provide support.\nThank you to Nina Mantilla, Jessie Romero and Sonya Ravindranath Waddell for assistance\npreparing these remarks.\nPowell, Jerome H. “New Economic Challenges and the Fed’s Monetary Policy Review.” Speech\nat “Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for Monetary Policy,” an economic policy\nsymposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming,\nAugust 27, 2020.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nProduction and Investment\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\n\fSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

There are disparities in access to high-quality\nearly childhood education that track with disparities in college completion.\n• Pandemic-related child care and school closures risk exacerbating the already-large\ngaps in educational attainment between children from high- and low-income\nfamilies.\n• Parents are struggling to balance work, virtual schooling and child care. We’re seeing\nnegative e�ects on women’s labor force participation, and more parents leaving the\nworkforce could be detrimental to our country’s long-term growth.\n• Another issue is the health of the child care industry itself. We need to �gure out how\nto operate centers safely, e�ectively and a�ordably. One idea is to lower costs\nby broadening shared services models.\n• An intriguing option for making child care more a�ordable is expanding the Earned\nIncome Tax Credit (EITC) to provide more support to working parents.\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you, and thank you especially to the Back to Work Task\nForce, which is doing work that is absolutely critical to the future health and equity of our\neconomy.\nThis group is well aware of how important early childhood education is, but I’ll o�er you my\nperspectives on why. I’ll then talk about why that’s even more true in the context of\n\n\fCOVID-19 and some of the risks we face if we don’t get it right. Before I say more, I’ll note\nthat these thoughts are my own and not those of the Federal Open Market Committee or\nthe Federal Reserve System. I’m looking forward to hearing your questions and comments.\n\nTo talk about the importance of early childhood education, let me actually start with the\nother end of the educational system: college. We know that there are large returns to a\ncollege degree. On average, graduates tend to earn more money, are more likely to be\nemployed, are more resilient to downturns, and even have better health outcomes. Thirty\npercent of high school graduates don’t enroll in either two-year or four-year college. And\nfor those that do, going to college doesn’t always mean graduating — and you only get the\nbene�ts if you �nish.\nOnly around 60 percent of students who enroll in a four-year college graduate within six\nyears. For Hispanic students, the share is 57 percent, and for black students, it’s just 42\npercent. Graduation rates for lower-income students are between 10 and 15 percentage\npoints lower than for their higher-income peers. Richmond Fed research �nds that the\nprospect of not completing makes college risky, especially for students of modest means,\nand deters many others from investing in college altogether, leaving them unable to reap\nthe large rewards that graduates currently earn.\nWhy don’t more students enroll in college, and why is the dropout rate so high? One likely\nfactor is early experiences. Young children’s brains grow at an incredible rate, and we know\nfrom a large body of research that early childhood education is critical for building the\ninfrastructure that’s required to learn more complex skills later in life. This is true not only\nfor academic skills, but also for noncognitive or “soft skills.” School and early care settings\nare an opportunity for children to learn to regulate their emotions, to cooperate, to be on\ntime, to keep trying when a task is challenging — and these soft skills are themselves\ncritical for academic success.\nBut there are large disparities in access to high-quality early childhood education — and\nwhere it’s available, it’s often not a�ordable or it’s not high quality. Sixty percent of rural\nfamilies and 60 percent of urban families in the lowest-income quartile live in a “child care\ndesert.” And consider that in 28 states and the District of Columbia, center-based infant\ncare costs more than in-state college tuition.\nMany families may turn to friends and relatives, but these options don’t necessarily o�er\nthe same reliability or focused instruction. And programs to subsidize child care in the\nUnited States arguably don’t go very far to cover the costs, particularly for low-income\nfamilies.\nFor example, the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit is nonrefundable, which means that\nfamilies in the lowest-income quintile, who owe little or no income tax, don’t receive any\nbene�t from the credit. For the 12 percent of American families with kids who do receive a\nbene�t, the credit reduced their taxes by an average of $574 — compared to child care\n\n\fcosts that may be more than $10,000 per year.\nAnother subsidy is in the form of dependent care �exible spending accounts (FSAs), which\nallow families to set aside up to $5,000 pretax to pay for child care. As of 2019, just under\n40 percent of civilian employees had access to an FSA, but this varies considerably by\noccupation and income. For example, only 20 percent of workers in service occupations\nhad access to a dependent care FSA.\n\nThese issues are all the more important now, when we’re at risk of exacerbating the\nalready-large gap in educational attainment between children from high- and low-income\nfamilies. Here in Virginia, for example, many lower-income families depend on the public\nschool system to provide preschool for their children. But that system has been closed.\nHigher-income families have the resources to pay for private pre-K, a tutor, or to hire a\nteacher to facilitate virtual learning. At the very least, they have computers at home and\nreliable broadband access. Lower-income families don’t have these same resources, and\nwe should be worried about how far behind their children might fall — a concern that\nbecomes even greater when we think about the number of children in elementary, middle,\nand high school. We need this system to operate e�ectively, which includes providing\nbroadband access for all students, so that if virtual learning becomes necessary, no child is\nat a disadvantage.\nWe also need to be concerned about children’s parents. People are stressed. People are\nstruggling. Balancing work, child care, and virtual learning seems utterly impossible for\nsingle parents and workers who can’t work from home. I hear this every day in\nconversations in our Bank.\nWe’re seeing negative e�ects on women’s labor force participation rate in particular.\nWomen are one of a few key groups where we have potential to boost the workforce, to\nhelp o�set an aging population and declining birth rates. Unfortunately, right now we’re\nseeing things move in the opposite direction.\nResearch from the Minneapolis Fed found that mothers in states with early lockdowns were\nmore than 50 percent more likely to take leave from work than mothers in states with later\nlockdowns, whereas there was no di�erence for fathers. At the end of July, almost 1 in 3\nmothers ages 25-44 reported they weren’t working because of pandemic-related child care\nissues, compared to around 1 in 10 fathers.\nWith fall in full swing, the challenges of virtual schooling and prolonged child care closures\nare putting pressure on working women. In the latest jobs report, prime-age women had a\nlarger drop in labor force participation than men. Women still shoulder more than their fair\nshare at home: They spend 30 percent more time per day than men on household activities\nand almost twice the number of hours caring for children as fathers. Weighed against the\ncircumstances, it stands to reason that families are making tough decisions.\nIt’s reasonable to be concerned about the longer-term e�ects on parents’ wages and\n\n\fattachment to the labor force. A recent Brookings analysis found that nationwide, 70\npercent of working parents with young children at home — 23.5 million people — are child\ncare dependent, meaning they don’t have another nonworking adult at home to be a\nprimary caregiver. If even half of that group doesn’t return to work, our labor force\nparticipation rate would drop 2.5 percentage points. That would be a huge blow to our\ncountry’s potential growth.\nI’m also concerned about the overall health of the child care industry. It’s an essential one,\nand we don’t have the option of shutting it down or letting �rms go out of business. We\nneed to �gure out how to operate these businesses safely, e�ectively and a�ordably so\nfamilies can have peace of mind about their children’s care and learning environment.\nBut child care businesses were fragile even before the pandemic. Now they’re under\nenormous pressure as cleaning costs increase, capacity is challenged, and parents worry\nabout infection risk. Almost half of day care providers reported they are likely to go out of\nbusiness without further �nancial assistance. Some predict these closures will be more\nfrequent in lower- and middle-income and rural areas, which could put even more strain on\nworking families. Maybe they will have to drive farther, to pay more, to choose less than\nideal care, or to quit working altogether.\n\nI read a great quote from an early childhood educator recently. She said, “There is no\neconomic recovery without child care. As a nation we haven’t realized how critical child care\nis to all facets of our lives.” So a silver lining from this crisis might be that it is forcing us to\nhave a national conversation about just how critical child care and education are, which\ncould lead to greater innovation and investment. The Back to Work Task Force is a great\nexample of how that’s already happening.\nFor example, we can rethink delivery models that increase a�ordability, such as broadening\nshared services models for smaller day care providers. This can help them keep overhead\ndown by sharing the costs of services like cleaning, IT and human resources. Employers can\nplay a greater role, and we’ve seen some creative examples so far. For example, I know of\nan employer in West Virginia who’s o�ering a proctoring service for its employees’ children.\nAnd of course, we know many European countries provide or subsidize child care.\nOne option I �nd especially intriguing is expanding the earned income tax credit (EITC) to\nprovide more support to working parents to pay for high-quality child care. The EITC is a\nrefundable tax credit available to low- and moderate-income households that is designed\nto encourage work. Expanding it is an attractive option for several reasons. First, the\ninfrastructure for its delivery already exists. It is a matter of increasing the transfer being\nmade, and we have experience with this already. Second, one key aspect of the EITC is its\nsensitivity to the presence of dependent children. It treats single wage-earners very\ndi�erently from those with dependents. And it does this while rewarding work — it is a tax\ncredit on earned income, after all. Also, the EITC-based solution would not require\n\n\fpolicymakers to make decisions about providing or administrating child care.\nOf course, this wouldn’t address the issue of supply. But there is some evidence that when\nchild care subsidies decrease, the number of centers goes down as well — so it’s not a\nstretch to think that if more people could a�ord child care, the supply would increase.\nThere is still a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the future holds. But\nsolutions are possible, and they begin with the kind of strategic work this task force is\nundertaking to explore structural and policy changes for early care and education in\nVirginia. I’m optimistic that our country will �nd a way to leverage this moment and address\nthese challenges that have been with us for decades, and I am very grateful for all the\npeople here today working to make that happen.\nThank you, and now I’ll open it up for questions and comments.\nThank you to Jessica Brooks and Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nData from the National Center for Education Statistics.\nBased on the 2012 starting cohort.

These thoughts are my own and\nnot those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. That frees\nme up to be as direct as I want, and I’m looking forward to hearing your questions and\ncomments. My background is business, not research, so I hope you �nd my views and\nexperience relevant.\nI’d like to start with the big picture before turning to the latest data. Economic activity fell\no� a cli� in March and April as we shut down, increased rapidly in May and early June as\nthe economy reopened, and then began to �atten in late June and July as the virus\nresurged. Over the last month, the virus has receded somewhat, though cases remain at\nelevated levels while the death rate has dropped. Vaccines are becoming more proximate,\nbut their rollout and e�ectiveness are still hard to predict. Recent data posts, most notably\n\n\fthe jobs report, have surprised on the upside. Congress has failed to pass another stimulus\nmeasure, creating risks to the less fortunate — though to be fair we haven’t yet seen that\nimpact in the numbers.\nSo where are we then? Given the steepness of the drop, trying to interpret the rebound in\ngrowth rates is confusing. I prefer to talk levels not rates: where are we today versus where\nwe were pre-COVID-19. The unemployment rate is 8.4 percent, up from 3.5 percent in\nFebruary. Nearly 12 million fewer Americans are employed, a drop of 7.6 percent. Spending\nis coming back faster than employment. Real Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) —\n68 percent of the economy — is down 4.8 percent from its January peak. Within that,\nspending on goods is actually up 6.4 percent, but services spending is still down\n9.7 percent. Our best proxy for business investment, new orders of nondefense capital\ngoods excluding aircraft, is down 0.5 percent since February, though it was lagging at that\ntime. And of course, government spending is up 53.7 percent as �scal policy has attempted\nto bridge the downturn.\nBut today I want to focus on a question I’ve been getting a lot these days: Are we at risk of\nseeing escalating in�ation? If you focus on the data, this question is a bit surprising. The\nFed’s in�ation target is 2 percent. Over the last 20 years, headline PCE in�ation has been 1.8\npercent. Over the last 10 years, 1.5 percent. Over the last year, 1.3 percent. Over the last\n6 months, 1 percent. It certainly hasn’t been escalating so far.\nIf anything, �nancial markets seem more concerned about low in�ation, not high. TIPS\nbreakevens fell from 2.3 percent in 2007 to 1.6 percent today and were even lower a couple\nof months ago.\n\nOn the other hand, I can understand why people might expect that higher in�ation is on\nthe horizon.\nSome people worry about the actions the Fed has taken in response to the COVID-19\npandemic. After declining post the global �nancial crisis, the size of our balance sheet has\nsurged to unprecedented levels, from $4.5 trillion to $7 trillion. As a result, M2 has\nexpanded. To the casual observer, the actions the Fed has taken in recent months might\nlook like the kind of “money printing” that has historically been associated with in�ation.\nThe Fed has also lowered interest rates to near zero and has pledged to keep them there\nfor a long time. As Chair Powell said in a recent press conference, “We’re not even thinking\nabout thinking about raising rates.” Our recent changes to our monetary policy framework\nand our recent statement support modest overshoots of our target to bolster in�ation\nexpectations. While this guidance should help support economic recovery, some might fear\nthat it could de-anchor in�ation expectations.\nLike the Fed, the federal government has also taken unprecedented action in response to\nthe pandemic.\n\n\fCongress passed a $2 trillion stimulus package in March, and lawmakers continue to\ndebate further stimulus. Federal debt has risen to its highest levels since World War II.\nFiscal spending could pressure prices, and, at some point, mounting government debt\ncould trigger in�ation if investors begin to believe that the Fed will not raise interest rates\nwhen necessary.\nOn the consumer side, households have witnessed supply constraints �rsthand for food\nand household items, leading to higher prices at the grocery store, for example. Indeed,\naccording to the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers, in�ation expectations ticked\nup from 2.1 percent in April to 3.2 percent in May. While they have declined to 2.7 percent\nin the preliminary September results, that’s still high relative to the past few years. The core\nconsumer price index has expanded at a 5.1 percent annual rate in the last three months.\nAnd one could imagine an in�ationary scenario — perhaps with the rollout of an e�ective\nvaccine — where demand comes roaring back at a time when supply is still constrained.\nEven though it was 45 years ago, many of the people I talk to are part of the generation that\nstill remembers the Great In�ation of the 1970s. So I can understand how, with that\nperspective, all of these things might be alarming.\n\nThat said, I see the recent tick up as just a natural rebound from a de�ationary second\nquarter. And, while it is certainly possible that in�ation could escalate in the near future, I\nhave to say I’m less worried about that possibility.\nIn 2008, the Fed began paying interest on the reserves it issues. That change means that a\nlarger balance sheet doesn’t have the in�ationary impact that it might have in the past.\nInstead, think of it as merely a reduction in the maturity of outstanding government debt,\nas the Fed issues short-term debt in exchange for longer-term debt. That’s quite di�erent\nthan “printing money.” And, our surveys show that banks are tightening standards, so there\nis little evidence that the increase in reserves is fueling an explosion in loans.\nOn the �scal side, the saving rate in the second quarter was 26 percent and still 18 percent\nin July (vs. 8 percent pre-crisis), suggesting that �scal stimulus isn’t yet overwhelming\nsupply. And recent experience internationally has taught us that our capacity to take on\nadditional debt may be higher than we previously thought.\nThe last global recession was similarly accompanied by fears of in�ation from �scal and\nunconventional monetary stimulus. Instead, we saw low and stable in�ation here, in\nEurope, and in Japan. What might explain this?\nIn today’s environment of stable in�ation expectations, I see moderate in�ation driven\nlargely by market power and price transparency. Greater price transparency facilitated by\nthe internet may have increased consumer price elasticity and thereby dampened the\nresponsiveness of in�ation to resource pressures. At the same time, the rise of national\nlow-price retailers and nonmarket purchasers, who leverage very aggressive professional\n\n\fpurchasing disciplines and global alternatives, has made sellers hesitant to raise prices.\nEconomist Thomas Philippon’s recent book on declining competition in America is\ncompelling, but he really only talks about purchasing power in a labor context. I actually\nthink it has even more impact on the price of goods.\nStill, if these forces dissipate (say through deglobalization or antitrust) or if in�ation does\nstart to rise despite these forces, the Fed has proven e�ective tools to �ght it. We may be\nlimited in lowering rates below zero, but we do not face the same constraint when it comes\nto raising rates to respond to in�ation should it appear.\n\nAs you know, the recent focus of our profession has actually been to try to create a little\nmore in�ation, not less. And I would count myself among those who think a little more is\nwelcome so that we don’t continue to be persistently below target and perhaps reduce\nexpectations going forward. Our recent revision of our long-run monetary policy framework\nwas in part intended to �nd ways to boost in�ation and in�ation expectations a bit. I try to\nbe humble about our ability to impact in�ation, given the market forces I’ve described. So,\nas I evaluated these changes, I always asked myself whether the medicine was worth the\npain.\nWhile in�ation has run below our 2 percent target, as I said earlier, it is not that far-o�\ntarget; with rounding, you could even call it on target. Moreover, in�ation expectations are\nstable and well anchored. Monetary policy doesn’t operate with precision, so e�orts to\ncreate a little more in�ation do risk de-anchoring expectations and taking us higher than\nwe want to go. That’s why I like where we landed in our new framework, making clear our\nwillingness to have an overshoot — but only a moderate one. Wednesday’s statement\nreinforces that message. I think that moderation limits the risk of de-anchoring while\nsending a positive signal on in�ation.\nOf course, our review also considered aggressive versions of makeup strategies where the\nFed commits to a formula to make up for periods where in�ation has been below target.\nYou’ll note that our language “average ... over time” permits us to look at our longer-term\ntrack record, while the Chairman has made clear we are not committing to a precise\nformula. I’m happy with that balance, as I remain skeptical of formulaic commitments. Such\ncommitments depend heavily on the central bank’s credibility to bind their successors to\nsuboptimal decisions in the future. Unlike Snape’s commitment in Harry Potter, monetary\npolicy doesn’t have an “unbreakable vow.”\nI also welcome the acknowledgement in our framework that meeting our mandate requires\na stable �nancial system. Holding rates low for a long time also can have negative\nconsequences. It generates “reach for yield” behaviors that can lead to market volatility. It\nnarrows the interest rate spread that so many community banks depend on. It can lead to\nexcess leverage, since borrowing is cheap, which could make future �nancial contractions\nmore painful. So I don’t see “lower for longer” as “zero forever” and am hoping that we can\n\n\fmove toward normalization when the time is right. And if risks arise, last week’s statement\ngives us freedom to act.\nThinking more broadly, I want to emphasize that, for now, I remain focused on\nunemployment, given the huge gap between where we are today and our target. As we\nlearned from the Fed Listens sessions, the public doesn’t see raising in�ation as an urgent\nconcern, and I agree with those who see our new framework as evolution, not revolution.\nLuckily, at a time when we are missing both targets, there is no con�ict in giving maximum\nstimulus, as we’re doing today.\n\nI am hopeful our new framework will be of value. As we implement it, I’m personally\ncommitted to being opportunistic. When in�ation nears or slightly exceeds 2 percent, I\nhope to celebrate it and not be too hasty to quash it.\nI’m also committed to being optimistic. Industry takes its cue from us. If we persist in\npursuing 2 percent and show con�dence in our capabilities, price setters will follow. In\ncontrast, the more we bemoan any lack of success — and remember I remain humble\nabout our capabilities — the more impetus we give them to push purchased prices down.\nRecognizing the risk that I’m doing just that, I commit to tearing up this speech when we’re\ndone.\nAnd for those who continue to worry about whether in�ation will explode, I guess I come\nback to a few key thoughts. It hasn’t yet. It didn’t after the last downturn, despite similar\nconcerns in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Powerful market forces have been\nhelping keep it in check, and I don’t anticipate that they will dissipate anytime soon. And\nshould in�ation emerge, the Fed has the tools and the will to address it.\nThanks, and I’ll now open it up for questions and comments.\nThank you to Tim Sablik for assistance preparing these remarks.\nPhilippon, Thomas.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2020\n\nWest Virginia Women Moving Forward\nVirtual Summit\n\n• Getting more women into the workforce is our best opportunity to grow the\nworkforce, which could o�set an aging population and declining birthrates.\nWhile women’s labor force participation increased over the second half of the\n20th century, it leveled o� around 2000 and then began to decline.\n• In recent years, the decline seemed to be reversing as the tightness of the\nlabor market brought back women who’d been on the sidelines. But, women\nstill faced barriers to labor force participation: the persistent gender wage\ngap, a disproportionate share of home and care responsibilities, and a lack of\nhigh-quality, a�ordable child care.\n• The current crisis has brought these issues into sharp focus and we are\nalready seeing negative e�ects on women’s participation in the workforce.\nWe are also at risk of losing child care businesses, which could put even more\npressure on working families. And the shift to virtual education could\nexacerbate the already large gap in educational attainment between children\nfrom high- and low-income families.\n• Schools, child care and elder care are essential industries. We need to\noperate them safely, so families can have peace of mind that they can send\ntheir kids or parents without endangering their health. We need to operate\nthem e�ectively, which includes providing broadband access for all students,\nso that if virtual learning becomes necessary, children are not at a\ndisadvantage. And we need to operate them a�ordably.\n\n\f• There are some silver linings from this crisis. Employers have never had more\nincentive to help solve these problems. Rapid advances in online education\nhave solidi�ed the case for expanding broadband access. And, while the high\nunemployment rate is very di�cult for the people a�ected, displaced\nworkers could be retrained for high-need industries such as elder care, child\ncare and education. Though there is tremendous uncertainty, we can\nleverage this moment to address challenges that have been with us for\ndecades.\n\nThank you for inviting me to be with you today, at least virtually. I’m glad to see\nprivate and public groups coming together to remake systems that faced challenges\neven before the pandemic hit.\nThere is some irony that many people might not be able to attend this all-day Zoom\nsummit about reducing barriers to women’s participation because they are faced\nwith the very barriers we plan to tackle today — and some of you might be trying to\nmultitask in our new virtual back-to-school mode. If so, I understand! But I hope\nthat events like this help us capitalize on the moment to rethink how we do things\nin order to secure growth for the long haul. Before I say more, let me note that the\nviews I express are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System. Because\nwe are in the “quiet period” that precedes FOMC meetings, I will not address\nmonetary policy in my remarks today, nor can I take any questions. I’m sorry about\nthat.\n\nThe health of every economy depends on economic growth. And that depends in\nlarge part on growing the workforce. But, in the United States, as in most developed\neconomies, demographics are not on our side. We have an aging population, and\nbirthrates are declining.\nWhere we can get more workers? I want to make the case that our best opportunity\nis to bring more women into the workforce — and retain them. And there is\nuntapped potential, as just over two-thirds of prime-age adults not in the labor\nforce are women.\nBefore I talk about how we might do that, let me take a few minutes to review\nwhere we’ve been. Since the 1960s, women’s labor force participation has increased\ndramatically. It has risen across all ages, races, ethnicities, martial statuses, and\neducation levels. Many factors contributed to the increase, including societal\n\n\fnorms, a narrowing wage gap between men and women, and new approaches to\nhousehold chores. Women’s increasing participation has been a boon for our\ncountry: It led to economic growth and rising household incomes and o�set longterm declines in men’s participation.\nBut between 1997 and 2015, the participation rate for prime-age women in the\nUnited States dropped almost 3 percentage points. When we dig deeper into the\ndecline, we see a divide along education lines: The largest drop during that time\nperiod was among women with a high school degree or less. For many of these\nwomen, the fundamental economic equation just didn’t make sense. Weighed\nagainst child care costs, the potential loss of health care bene�ts, or the phaseout\nof the earned income tax credit (EITC), many jobs just weren’t worth the hassle and\nlow pay.\nIn recent years, the decline seemed to be reversing as the tightness of the labor\nmarket brought back women who’d been on the sidelines. Employers had been\nincreasing pay and addressing working conditions. Overall, prime-age women’s\nparticipation increased 2 percentage points between 2015 and 2019. The\nparticipation of women ages 25-44 with a high school degree or less — the group\nthat had previously experienced the largest decline — increased 3 percentage\npoints.\nBut this rise in participation didn’t mean that all the barriers to full participation had\nbeen solved. For example, although the wage gap has narrowed signi�cantly over\nthe last 40 years, women still make 81.5 cents for every dollar that men make. And\nwomen still shoulder more than their fair share at home: Women spend 30 percent\nmore time per day than men on household activities, and mothers spend almost\ntwice the number of hours caring for children as fathers. In addition, there is a\ndearth of high-quality, a�ordable child care to support working parents.\nNationwide, 51 percent of people live in what’s known as “child care deserts,”\ndisproportionately in rural and low-income areas. And in the majority of states, the\naverage cost of center-based care for an infant is comparable to, or even higher\nthan, in-state college tuition and fees. But even with the high costs of child care,\nthe centers themselves operate on notoriously thin margins, and so their health is\nunstable. And child care workers generally earn low wages and receive few bene�ts,\ncontributing to high turnover.\n\nThe current crisis has brought these issues into sharp focus. In previous recessions,\nmen’s employment has been hit harder. But this recession is di�erent: Women\naccount for a majority of private sector net job losses even though they hold a\n\n\fminority of these jobs.\nAnd they may be at risk for losing more in the future. I’m hesitant to make a strong\nprediction, but some early research suggests that women are more represented in\njobs that require physical contact and in those with high potential for automation.\nIf you believe we will be in a post-pandemic world where people will be reluctant to\nengage in physical contact, then it is reasonable to think these jobs are at risk.\nWe’ve also seen an explosion of care responsibilities. With schools and day cares\nclosed, tens of millions of kids have been at home. Balancing work, child care, and\nvirtual learning seems utterly impossible for single parents and workers who can’t\nwork from home. I hear this every day in conversations in our Bank. And that’s if\nyou’re fortunate enough to have reliable broadband access or even a home\ncomputer at all. The lack of adequate technology is more likely to be a problem for\nfamilies in rural areas, lower-income families, families of color, and families whose\nparents have less formal education. When I was here two weeks ago, I heard\nabout kids going to McDonald’s to do their schoolwork. We can’t accept that as a\nmodel.\nMany families also have elderly parents to care for, at a time when nursing homes\nseem like less attractive options. Families spending nearly all their time at home\nalso means more meals to prepare, more laundry, and more cleaning. And all of\nthis comes at a time when there is less support. The usual informal backup\narrangements, such as grandparents or neighbors, may be o�-limits because of\nsocial distancing, stay-at-home orders, or concerns about vulnerable populations.\nWe know this is already disproportionately a�ecting women’s participation in the\nworkforce. Research from the Minneapolis Fed found that mothers in states with\nearly lockdowns were more than 50 percent more likely to take leave from work\nthan mothers in states with later lockdowns, whereas there was no di�erence for\nfathers. At the end of July, almost 1 in 3 mothers ages 25-44 reported they weren’t\nworking because of COVID-19-related child care issues, compared to around 1 in 10\nfathers. As we head into the fall, the challenges of virtual schooling and prolonged\nchild care closures may already be putting downward pressure on women’s\nparticipation. In the latest employment report, prime-age women were the only\ngroup with declining participation.\nIf these challenges continue, there may be additional fallout. In the short term, we\nrisk losing child care businesses as cleaning costs increase, capacity is challenged,\nand parents worry about infection risk. Almost half of day care providers reported\nthey are likely to go out of business without further �nancial assistance. Some\npredict these closures will be steeper in lower- and middle-income and rural\n\n\fareas. This could put even more pressure on working families. And if parents\nhave to take a break from the workforce to care for children, it’s reasonable to be\nconcerned about the longer-term e�ects on their wages and attachment to the\nlabor force. A recent Brookings analysis calculated that nationwide, 70 percent of\nworking parents with young children at home — 23.5 million people, including 13\nmillion women — are child care dependent, meaning they don’t have another\nnonworking adult at home to be a primary caregiver. If even half of that group\ndoesn’t return to work, our labor force participation rate would drop 2.5 percentage\npoints. That would be a huge blow to our country’s potential growth.\nAnother long-term risk is exacerbating the already large gap in educational\nattainment between children from high- and low-income families. The former have\nthe means to attend in-person private schools, or to pay for private tutoring, or to\nhire a teacher to facilitate virtual learning for a “pod” of other high-income students.\nAt the very least, they have computers at home and reliable broadband access. The\nlatter don’t have these same resources, and we should be worried about how far\nbehind they might fall.\n\nIn my view, schools, child care, and elder care are essential industries, so we don’t\nhave the option of shutting them down or letting them go out of business. We need\nto �gure out how to operate them safely, so families can have peace of mind that\nthey can send their kids or parents without endangering their health. We need to\noperate them e�ectively, which includes providing broadband access for all\nstudents, so that if virtual learning becomes necessary, children are not at a\ndisadvantage. I know that has been a priority in West Virginia. And we need to\noperate them a�ordably. One option to explore is a shared services model for day\ncare providers to help them keep overhead down. And there is probably no getting\naround expanding public and/or private investment in early childhood education\nand child care. I’m particularly intrigued by the idea of expanding the EITC to\nprovide more support to working parents to pay for high-quality child care.\nWith respect to these needs, there may be a few silver linings from this crisis. First,\nemployers still need employees, which means they have enormous incentive to\nhelp solve these problems. I recently heard about one of the bigger employers in\nWest Virginia operating a proctoring service for employees with kids in school.\nWe’ve also seen rapid advances in online education, and there has never been\nmore political agreement on the need for expanding broadband access. And while\nthe high unemployment rate is very di�cult for the people a�ected, perhaps some\nof them could retrain for new careers in high-need industries such as elder care,\nchild care, and education. Along the same lines, the pandemic has unfortunately led\n\n\fto a number of store closings. But there could be an opportunity to repurpose\nexcess retail space for child care.\nThere is still a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the future holds. But\nI’m optimistic that our country will �nd a way to leverage this moment to address\nchallenges that have been with us for decades. Events like this are an excellent\nstart, and I look forward to learning more.\nThank you to Abigail Crockett, Nina Mantilla, and Jessie Romero for assistance\npreparing these remarks.\nBureau of Labor Statistics via Haver Analytics.\nJones, Larry E., Rodolfo E.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2020\n\nI’m hesitant to make a strong prediction about which jobs will disappear or which will grow\nonce we’ve weathered the pandemic. After all, in the wake of 9/11, people thought we’d\nnever travel again, and then we did. But it seems quite possible that — even with a vaccine\nor treatment — we will be in a world where highly exposed personal service sectors, such\nas restaurants, retail, and entertainment, continue to operate at reduced capacity, which\nwould mean fewer jobs in those sectors. That leads me to ask, who works in these jobs, and\nwhat happens to them if some percentage of them don’t return?\nWorkers in these highly exposed jobs are generally hourly employees, working part time,\nand they tend to be younger than the workforce as a whole — just over 1 in 4 are between\nthe ages of 16 and 24, twice their representation in the workforce overall. These jobs o�er\nlow wages and few, if any, bene�ts. Still, some younger workers take these jobs (43 percent\nof workers between the ages of 16-24 work in retail trade and leisure and hospitality alone)\nbecause they’re a great way to get a start in the workforce and gain experience and soft\nskills. (I got my start in my uncle’s bagel shop.) Others appreciate the �exibility that allows\nthem to work while they’re in school. And for workers who lack the resources or academic\npreparation for postsecondary education, these jobs might be the only path that’s open to\nthem. Another attraction is that you can move nearly anywhere and count on �nding a job\nin a restaurant or retail.\nThose in these customer-facing service roles have been disproportionately a�ected by the\npandemic, and younger workers in them have fared worse than older workers. Between\nFebruary and April, nearly 50 percent of “highly exposed workers” aged 16-24 lost their\njobs, compared to 36 percent of highly exposed workers aged 25-54. While the\nunemployment rate for the population as a whole has increased to 10.2 percent (net\nnegative 6.7 points since February), the unemployment rate for workers aged 16-24 is still\n10.9 points up from where it was in February, currently sitting at 18.6 percent.\nWhat happens to a server or cashier who has lost his or her job? Chances are, they can’t get\na job at another restaurant or store because so many other highly exposed, high contact\n\n\fjobs are going away at the same time. So where can young people who have yet to enter\nthe labor market go to get a foothold in the labor market and start building experience and\nsavings? Maybe we’ll see new entry-level jobs delivering groceries or meals, but I’m doubtful\nthese segments will grow quickly enough to immediately replace the millions of jobs that\nhave been lost. In the interim, young people will face substantial uncertainty and will be set\nback. And if young people have a harder time starting out, what does this mean for them\ndecades from now? We know that early circumstances matter: Research suggests that well\nover half of income and wealth inequality is determined by a person’s circumstance at age\n23. And research has shown that graduating from college during a recession has persistent\nnegative e�ects on people’s earnings and health.\nWhat can be done? The most powerful lever would be to retain as many of these jobs as\npossible. Temporary relief has helped. But looking ahead, we need to ensure that\nincentives for locating and pursuing new operating models are in place. We can count on\ncontinued innovation of the kinds we’ve already seen, like constructing more outdoor\nseating at restaurants, pivoting to takeout and delivery, turning retail stores into ecommerce ful�llment centers, investing in online platforms that are helping small\nbusinesses get their products to customers, and creating virtual options for traditionally inperson personal services like live �tness classes. Each of these innovations has created\ndemand for employees to perform new and di�erent tasks — and jobs. The economy will\nneed even more.\nThe economy also needs smart, �exible and concerted training e�orts to prepare people,\nparticularly displaced workers and young people with less education, for other in-demand\n�elds. Policy can help by allowing students to use Pell Grants for certi�cate programs and\ngiving community colleges the funding they need to teach online. For this group of younger\nworkers, in particular, who are digital natives, the innovations in online learning could pay\nreal dividends.\nThis type of retraining won’t be e�ective without businesses investing as well. New jobs are\nbeing created in this pandemic. And a number of sectors, such as trucking, nursing,\ntechnology, and skilled trades, continue to struggle to �nd quali�ed employees. We are\nstarting to see innovative approaches in recruitment as employers look to this pool for\ntalent. But the economy will require even more aggressive and targeted recruiting e�orts,\nsuch as community college partnerships and generalist training programs, to redeploy\nthese workers into new careers.\nThe challenge seems daunting, but we have done this before when a large pool of workers\nneeded education and training. In the 1800s, we created a system of land-grant universities\nto provide farmers and other rural residents with access to higher education. When World\nWar II veterans returned home, we created a pathway for them to earn college and\ntechnical degrees. These e�orts weren’t perfect, particularly with respect to their treatment\nof minority groups, but they demonstrate the potential upside. In the aftermath of this\ncrisis, we have the opportunity to do so again.\n\n\f“Highly exposed jobs” refers to workers in “highly exposed census industries,” a classi�cation\nof sectors by their exposure to employment losses. For a complete look at the industries\nincluded in the “highly exposed” group as well as further data on workers in this category,\nsee Dey et al.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2020\n\nOur nation has recently increased its focus on a tragic reality: Life outcomes vary widely by\nrace. In June, the unemployment rate for black Americans was 15.4 percent, more than 5\npercentage points higher than the rate for white Americans (10.1 percent). Even before the\ncurrent crisis, when unemployment was at historic lows, there was a gap of around 3\npercentage points. Median income for white households in 2018 was $71,000, compared to\n$41,000 for black households. The wealth gap is even larger: White households’ median net\nworth is nearly 10 times higher than that of black households. More than one-third of white\nadults have bachelor’s degrees while only about one-�fth of black adults do. And if you’re\nwhite, you’re even likely to live longer. Here in Richmond, Virginia, life expectancy can vary\nby as much as 20 years between some of the poorest, mostly black neighborhoods and the\nmost a�uent, mostly white neighborhoods. This has been made all too clear by the\ndisproportionate toll the pandemic is taking on communities of color.\nIn the Fifth Federal Reserve District, which spans from South Carolina through Maryland\nand most of West Virginia, a larger share of our population is black, at 22.6 percent,\ncompared to 12.3 percent in the country as a whole. That’s not surprising given our\nhistory: Every state (including the District of Columbia) was a slave state, even those that\ndid not secede from the Union. My o�ce is in the former capital of the Confederacy. When\nI look out my window, I can see the island where Union prisoners of war were held and the\nruins of a bridge burned by retreating Confederate troops. The legacy of this era still a�ects\noutcomes today, in ways both obvious and subtle.\nOur small towns also have a larger black population than in the nation as a whole; nearly 20\npercent of our small-town residents are black compared to about 9 percent nationwide.\nThis is particularly true in the Carolinas, where many plantations were located. Nearly 37\npercent of South Carolina’s small-town population is black. And we know smaller towns in\nthis country have struggled to keep pace with the growth in the cities.\nThere are of course also signi�cant black populations in our district’s major cities, and these\ncities are thriving along many dimensions. But — with the exception of the District of\n\n\fColumbia, which is a unique circumstance — they also display some of the worst economic\nmobility in the country. According to research by economists Raj Chetty, Nathaniel\nHendren, Patrick Kline, and Emmanuel Saez, Charlotte, North Carolina, has the worst\neconomic mobility of the nation’s 50 largest metro areas. Raleigh was number 48 on the\nlist, and Baltimore was number 37. (Atlanta, another southern city, came in 49th.)\nEducation is critical to growing incomes and wealth. But the black residents of our region\nwere explicitly denied equal access to education for 100 years after the Civil War. I attended\nrecently integrated public schools in Tampa, Florida. My black classmates clearly started at\na disadvantage, and we know that kind of disadvantage can be hard to overcome even\ngenerations later.\nEven after schools became integrated, “white �ight” to private schools and the suburbs\nlargely re-segregated southern school systems once again. And limitations on cities’ ability\nto grow (and in some cases their ability to operate) left their educational funding\ndisadvantaged as well. For example, Baltimore’s current boundaries were e�ectively �xed\nby a 1948 change in the law that allows county residents to reject any future annexation\nattempts by the city.\nThe Jim Crow era limited black individuals’ ability to access credit, build businesses and\nthereby create wealth. Many instead chose to emigrate from the south to seemingly more\nattractive parts of the country. Those who remained have struggled with credit for\ngenerations, starting with the sharecropping model that left so many in peonage. And for\nyears, many Deep South states have been comparatively reluctant to spend on local\nservices, which disproportionately go to and provide jobs for the disadvantaged.\nThe regional Fed banks are charged with understanding the dynamics within our districts.\nIn pursuit of that goal we have been investing in research that addresses these issues and\nthe racial inequities that result.\nWe have made a big investment in analyzing how to support smaller towns, where\nresidents su�er from educational disparities, inability to connect to jobs, isolation, and low\nworkforce participation.\nWe have work underway on economic mobility, a particular issue in our larger cities.\nWe have a multi-year commitment to workforce development. Motivated by research\n�nding that well over half of income and wealth inequality is determined by a person’s\ncircumstances at age 23, we have focused especially on the critical role played by early\nchildhood education and on the preparation students need to succeed at college.\nWe’re working to understand di�erences in whites’ and blacks’ opportunities to participate\nin �nancial markets, particularly around mortgage markets, payday lending, and student\nloans; our community development team has launched a new program to connect banks\nwith Community Reinvestment Act-eligible projects.\nThe racial disparities in our district are the result of hundreds of years of unequal access\n\n\fand unequal treatment. In the context of a country with great challenges, we recognize\nours are even greater. We’re committed to playing a positive role in �nding the solutions.\nSee Virginia Commonwealth University’s Mapping Life Expectancy Project.\nBased on the 2014-2018 American Community Survey.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2020\n\nWe’re used to thinking about the density of urban areas as a bene�t: Lots of people means\nlots of employers and jobs, lots of restaurants, and plenty of things to do on the weekend.\nConversely, we’re used to thinking about the distance in smaller towns as an obstacle:\nFewer employers, fewer health care options, and less access to quality education and other\namenities.\nAs a result, a big story in recent decades has been the growth of bigger cities and the\ndecline of many smaller towns.\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that density can be dangerous and that\ngeographic proximity isn’t necessarily an obstacle to connection. And stories change. In the\n1970s, few could have imagined the revitalization that’s occurred in cities like Pittsburgh or\nDetroit (although not everyone in those cities has bene�ted equally). So I wonder if this is\nan opportunity for smaller towns to rewrite their endings.\nAre people going to start moving out of cities? It’s reasonable to think at least some will, as\nthe risks posed by density could nullify some of the reasons people live in cities in the �rst\nplace.\nIf you live in an urban area so that you can go to plays and concerts, for example, but you’re\nworried about the risk of infection at a large event, is it still worth paying a premium to live\nnear those amenities? Similarly, if you live in an urban area to be close to your work but the\npast few months have demonstrated that you can successfully work remotely, do you still\nneed to live close to the o�ce? Could you move back to your hometown — closer to family\n— to a place where you are less exposed to community transmission? And for years, public\ntransportation has been an amenity. Just look at the development along Metro’s Orange\nLine in Northern Virginia. But ridership has plummeted more than 90 percent relative to\nlast spring. Living in a smaller home to be close to a subway line might not seem that\nappealing anymore.\nAt the same time cities might be less attractive, some of the hurdles facing smaller\n\n\fcommunities might be more surmountable than we thought. Take health care, for example.\nSmaller communities generally have less access, particularly to hospitals and specialists,\nwhich contributes to poorer health outcomes in these communities. But telemedicine can\nincrease the network of care and reduce overall costs by reducing readmissions and\navoidable emergency room visits. This crisis has dramatically accelerated telemedicine’s use\nwhere it’s available. This is partly because many people want to avoid health care settings\nbecause they fear infection, and partly because many regulations that inhibited widespread\nuse, such as drug prescription rules, state licensure limits, and Medicare reimbursement\nrules, have been temporarily waived. Making such waivers permanent is a critical step\ntoward expanding the availability of telemedicine for people who live in smaller towns.\nHigh-quality education, particularly postsecondary education and workforce training, is\nanother challenge in many smaller communities, which tend to have fewer college\ngraduates. Many things contribute, including physical distance to schools, less information\nabout the options available to students and workers, and a lack of role models. But we’re\nseeing a huge expansion of online learning options. Further developing virtual education\ncould open doors for people to continue their education and workforce training when it\nmight not have been otherwise feasible.\nWe’re also thinking di�erently about the labor market. Telecommuting means workers can\nlive anywhere, and employers can recruit talent from everywhere. And of course there’s\nshopping. Many people want to live in close proximity to grocery stores, clothing stores,\nand other retail outlets. But we’ve been shopping from home for months now; if you can\nbuy everything you need online, it doesn’t matter as much where you live.\nThe caveat, of course, is that everything I’ve just described requires high-speed internet\naccess. And the lack of broadband access is a serious issue in smaller towns and rural\nareas, from the perspectives of both availability and a�ordability. The pandemic has\nunderscored just how critical it is: If kids are going to be educated from home, for example,\nthey need the tools to do so. This is a complicated issue, or we would have solved it already\n— but never has there been more political agreement on the need. If the country is going\nto do something — and we should — now is the time. Additional stimulus money is being\ndebated as I write this. What better place to invest it?\nOf course, it’s easy to say “build it and they will come.” But broadband access is far from the\nentire answer. Small towns that want to change their trajectory also need to put themselves\non the map for those looking to relocate. This requires three key ingredients. The �rst is a\ngood story — maybe it’s about natural beauty, or local amenities, or nearby colleges. The\nstory is for employers, and the story is for talent. The story is also about marketing to those\nwho already live there — not only why one should come, but also why one should stay.\nThe second ingredient is an integrated regional approach. Almost by de�nition, small towns\nare surrounded by other small towns, and the strategy for that region needs to be\nintegrated across jurisdictions. The path to success isn’t going it alone; instead, it’s working\ntogether. One community might have better elementary schools, another more employers,\n\n\fand another the regional airport. The story needs to encompass the region.\nThird, smaller communities need to �nd a source of committed funding, whether it’s\nfederal or state agencies, local donors or foundations, local businesses, hotel taxes,\ntobacco settlement funds, or asset sales. It also requires developing the capacity to absorb\nthat funding: A lot of money is being allocated federally right now and some local\norganizations are going to be challenged. The towns that seem to have the most\nmomentum are the ones that seem to make the most out of their potential funding\nsources.\nNone of this is easy. But our nation is in the midst of an unprecedented crisis — and as we\nhave shown throughout our history, unprecedented changes can turn into opportunities.\nTelemedicine, telecommuting, online learning, and broadband can be funded at levels that\nwould have been inconceivable just a few months ago. As a result, to the extent our health\nconcerns persist, we might �nd a silver lining for the smaller towns that can tell their story\nwell.\n\nSmall Town and Rural Communities\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2020\n\nWe know the numbers are bleak: 21 million Americans are unemployed, and the number of\npeople who are not working and not actively looking for work (which means they’re not\no�cially counted as “unemployed”) has risen by an additional 8.3 million in two months.\nRetail sales of consumer goods have fallen by almost 23 percent, manufacturing production\nhas dropped over 18 percent, and GDP was down at a 5 percent annual rate in the �rst\nquarter. Forecasters expect this quarter to be much worse.\nWe also know that the e�ects of the crisis have not been felt evenly. Most distressingly,\npeople of color have disproportionately fallen victim to the virus, and they’ve also been\nmore likely to face job loss — underscoring historic fault lines in our society that are\npainfully tangible at present. With a broader lens, pre-COVID-19, we were seeing job market\npolarization: Loss of middle income jobs and increases in jobs at the extremes of the wage\nscale. The job losses in this crisis are centered on the low end of that “barbell” — service\njobs which are disproportionately held by women and those with less education.\nFor the tens of millions of people who have lost their jobs, uncertainty is high. Will they be\ncalled back to their former places of employment? If not, what jobs will be available to\nthem? Will the industries in which they’ve been trained continue to exist at the scale they\ndid in the past — or continue to exist at all?\nBut even those who remain employed face challenges. First and foremost, the essential\nfront-line workers who provide us with vital services, especially health care, do so at great\npersonal risk and emotional toll.\nWorkers with families also are under immense strain right now. I hear this every day in\nconversations with our Bank’s employees, many of whom have young kids at home and are\nstruggling to balance work and home. The challenges are di�erent, but no less real, for\nfamilies taking care of elderly parents. Over the past two months, we’ve seen\ndisproportionate drops in workforce participation among groups that had been trending\nupward, such as prime age women and those age 55 and over. Care responsibilities, at a\n\n\ftime when child care and schools are closed and elder care facilities are perceived to be\nless safe, can make it di�cult to work. And perhaps baby boomers are leaving the\nworkforce given the increased health risk they perceive.\nLegislators and monetary policymakers have taken extraordinary steps to support the\nhealth of our economy. But if we are going to get to the other side of this crisis, we have to\nbe thinking about the longer-term changes that will enable our economy to recover — and\ngive more people a shot at participating when it does.\nWe need aggressive and consistent workplace health protection protocols. These are\ncritical for essential workers, who deserve our full protection. They are critical to convince\ndisplaced workers it is safe to come back. And they are critical to make consumers feel safe\nwhen they visit a store or a restaurant. De�ning those standards and ensuring they are\nbroadly followed will require strong public-private coordination. It’s possible we will see\nsome drop in productivity in the short term as we stand up the processes and practices to\nmake this possible, but if the protocols are clear and consistent, businesses will redesign\ntheir operations to regain productivity in the medium term. And longer term, they may\neven see dividends in the form of a healthier workforce with less absenteeism.\nWe need to focus on workforce redeployment. I’m intrigued by the rapid development of\nwidespread online education. Perhaps states will �nd that they can deploy online tools to\nretrain large numbers of unemployed people for industries that are hiring, at low cost and\nprice. That of course would require expansion of access to broadband. We also have a real\nopportunity to bolster our community colleges, which play a crucial role standing up\ntraining programs for in-demand careers and bringing employers and workers together.\nBoth schools and students need funding, especially in the current environment, and one\nway to help would be to allow federal and state �nancial aid to be used for workforce\ncredential programs.\nWe need well-functioning child care and elder care. But both of these industries are at risk.\nGiven that the cost of providing high-quality child care is far more than the majority of\nfamilies can pay for, there is probably no getting around expanding public and/or private\ninvestment in early childhood education and child care. Elder care industries — both\nnursing homes and in-home care — must �nd a way to assure families that they can\noperate safely, without undue risk to the health of our seniors. With an aging population\nand millions of working families dependent on child care in order to work, we need to �nd\nways to make these business models safe, sustainable, and a�ordable.\nThe health of our workers matters. The ability of those displaced by this crisis to �nd their\nnext career matters. And giving those who want and need to work the support they need\nmatters. To return our economy to its full potential, we need well-designed e�orts to\naddress these critical foundations.\n\n\fEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nWorkforce Development\n\nEconomic Inequality and Poverty\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

My grown kids, who\nleft us several years ago, have come back, and it is great fun to be together again. We are\nsurprisingly productive. We are spending less on travel and dining out, so are saving more.\nBut many people are in very di�erent circumstances. Take, for example, those who work in\nbusinesses deemed essential. They continue to go to their workplaces. They are proud to\nhave been deemed critical for the safety and security of our country and some are receiving\nhazard pay. But they know — no matter the precautions they are taking — that working\nposes a health risk to them and to their families.\nAnd of course, then there are the 38 million Americans who have �led for unemployment\nand the almost 5 million more who have left the workforce over the past two months.\nDespite enhanced bene�ts for those who are unemployed, they’re worried about their\npresent and their future.\nIt’s worth noting a socioeconomic split underlies these di�erent realities. Based on credit\ncard data, wealthier households, whose members are largely still working and doing so\nfrom home, are spending less; in contrast, low-income households, living much closer to\nthe edge, have largely maintained their spending. According to a recent survey by the\nFederal Reserve Board, 39 percent of those making less than $40,000 per year have faced a\njob loss in the past two months, compared to 13 percent making more than $100,000 per\nyear. The unemployment rate for those with less than a high school education is more than\n20 percent, more than double that of those who have a bachelor’s degree or higher (8\npercent). And of course, the former group has less savings to bu�er them in their time of\ndistress. This crisis has further solidi�ed the ability to work from home as a divider: 63\npercent of those with a bachelor’s degree are in jobs where they’re able to work from home\nduring the crisis; compared to only 23 percent of those with a high school degree or less.\nThe di�erential availability of broadband access exacerbates this gap.\nIncreasingly, as I talk to consumers and retailers, I hear that these di�erences may matter\n\n\fwhen we talk about the pace of recovery. We may see the economy come back at di�erent\nspeeds for di�erent parts of the economy.\nHigher-income households are cautious and can a�ord to be. Many of their jobs can\ncontinue to be done remotely. Many have taken the message that their absence from the\nworkplace has protected their health; they may be reluctant to reengage too quickly. They\ncan get much of what they need done through online channels, until such time as they\nbelieve they can shop without undue health risk. In a recent Gallup poll, 73 percent of those\nwith a college degree said testing would have to be widespread before they would return to\nnormal activities, versus an estimated 51 percent without that degree.\nBut lower-income households may well be coming back to stores more quickly because\nthey can’t a�ord not to — many live paycheck to paycheck. Fiscal payments put money in\ntheir pockets, which history suggests will be spent rapidly on needs they have left\nunful�lled. Access to online commerce is more limited, especially for those without access\nto credit or broadband. And if you work shoulder-to-shoulder (even 6 feet apart) in a\nproduction environment, then going to a store perhaps isn’t seen as such a large\nincremental risk. Lower-price retailers tell me sales are returning toward normal at a faster\npace than I hear from higher-priced retailers. I hear similar strength in smaller,\neconomically distressed towns that haven’t had signi�cant outbreaks.\nThese di�erent realities have implications for how widely shared our recovery will be, and\nbecause they also imply di�ering levels of health risk, implications for the course of the\nvirus itself. I am watching both closely.\n\nEconomic Inequality and Poverty\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\n\fEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2020\n\nThe past two months have been painful across the country. We have lost lives. We have lost\ntens of millions of jobs. We have lost security, connectivity and community.\nMultiple states are now in the process of reopening their economies. But, despite\nunprecedented measures by both the Fed and �scal authorities, things won’t be returning\nto normal quickly. As I wrote a few weeks ago, the pace will likely be slow, as businesses\nand consumers adapt to a world where personal interaction creates health risks.\nAs the United States navigates the path to recovery, I have been focusing on how much\ndamage has been done and how to minimize the longer-term impact.\nThe potential of our economy can be described most simply as the size of the workforce\nmultiplied by the productivity of that workforce. In the aftermath of this crisis, both factors\nface threats.\nThis virus has led to the closure of schools and day cares, while also challenging traditional\nforms of elder care. Dual career couples, single parents and care providers face daunting\nobstacles to balancing work and home responsibilities. Without more support, many risk\nleaving the workforce. Vulnerable populations such as baby boomers may protect their\nhealth by retreating from the labor force too. The great number of service workers\ndislocated by the pandemic may struggle to move into new careers. And new immigration\ncontrols may well reduce immigration’s historic role in helping grow the workforce. In an\nenvironment where demographic changes were already shrinking our complement of\nprime-age workers, these changes could accelerate its decline.\nI also worry about productivity. While new protocols for health and social distancing in\nrestaurants, retail and manufacturing operations will likely help boost consumer and\nemployee con�dence, there’s little doubt they will also increase costs. Businesses are\nalready redesigning their previously optimized supply chains to refocus on resiliency at the\nexpense of e�ciency. And as businesses adapt to the new world, real estate assets are\nbeing stranded. More fundamentally, increased debt loads, reduced bank lending capacity\n\n\fand diminished con�dence surely will have a meaningful impact on investment, through\nwhich much productivity enhancement occurs.\nA smaller, less-productive workforce leads to a smaller economy and a less attractive\nfuture. What can our country do to mitigate that potential impact?\nFirst, as states plan to restart their economies, it will be important to implement safe,\nreliable and a�ordable modi�cations to current practices. To get people back to work in\nforce, we need schools teaching, day cares operating and elder care models that protect\nour seniors. At the Richmond Fed, we are engaged in an e�ort in Virginia to reimagine how\nchild care in particular can be provided at necessary standards.\nIf we continue living in the shadow of this virus, job retraining will also need to be a focus —\ntargeted toward the large number of low-end service workers displaced by this crisis. Can\nthey be retrained to work in a large infrastructure e�ort or to provide an in-demand service\nsuch as home health care? One bright spot of the current shutdown has been the\ninvestment made in online educational delivery. States may �nd that they can deploy\nsigni�cant online retraining e�orts to a broad swath of the unemployed, perhaps even at a\nvery low cost (recognizing the need for equal access to broadband).\nAnd, in the spirit of never wasting a crisis, policymakers need to motivate business\ninvestment in new productivity levers. I am reminded that airline kiosk adoption really only\ntook o� after the tragedy of 9/11. Perhaps retail self-checkout, food delivery, telehealth\nand, yes, online education will see similar adoption escalation, as surely online shopping\nwill as well. Perhaps new productivity investments will need some government incentive to\nrestore con�dence in an uncertain environment.\nIt is hard to be optimistic when you are in the depths of a crisis, as we are now. But I’m a big\nbeliever in science and its ability to help us meet the challenges ahead. I’m also a big\nbeliever in the creative capacity of American workers and businesses. As an economic\npolicymaker, I see the task ahead as providing them with the support they need to unleash\ntheir potential.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nProduction and Investment\n\n\fReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2020\n\nThis pandemic is new for all of us, creating unprecedented uncertainty. First and foremost,\nfamilies are asking how best to protect their health and safety. But Americans are also\nasking about the health of the economy. How deep will this downturn be? How long will it\nlast? How fast will we recover?\nThe answer to the �rst question is now clear: it will be deep. The service sector is 70\npercent of the US economy and broad swaths of it are shut down, including travel, nonfood in-store retail, restaurants, sports and entertainment. Last week’s initial\nunemployment claims exceeded 6 million, nearly doubling the previous week’s 3.3 million.\nThe previous high had been 695,000 in 1982.\nThe duration is of course not fully knowable, but — absent a remission or treatment of the\nvirus — it is hard to imagine social distancing moderating until there is a signi�cant\nslowdown in new cases. While testing is expanding, it is far from universal. Most experts\nproject widespread availability is at least a month away. As testing rolls out, the number of\ncon�rmed cases will inevitably expand. It’s hard to imagine calling the country back to work\nuntil the numbers have started to drop, which could be May or even later. This of course\nwill be painful for tens of millions, and the recent �scal package is intended to mute the\nimpact of this elongated outage on businesses and employees, as are the Fed’s recent\nmoves to stabilize markets and lower interest rates.\nWhich gets us to the third and most important question for our economy: the pace of\nrecovery.\nThe good news is that one can have con�dence people will be able to go back to work.\nChinese companies have brought manufacturing back. Essential US businesses such as\ngrocery stores, logistics companies, hospitals and public safety have operated successfully\nthroughout this crisis. Each has used a now proven set of protocols, including appropriate\ndistancing, sneeze guards, gloves and masks, testing upon entrance, funding sick\nemployees to go home and deep cleaning where required. Companies that follow those\n\n\fprotocols should now know they can operate, not with zero illness but with the ability to\nassure employees they are safe. That of course assumes we address the current shortages\nin necessary personal protective equipment.\nThe challenge will be bringing consumers back. Consumer spending is two-thirds of GDP.\nOur con�dence in our ability to interact with others while staying healthy has been badly\nshaken. Hopefully doctors will quickly develop a treatment or vaccine. Absent that,\nbusinesses will have to �nd a way to convince consumers to shop, or eat out, to travel, or\ngo to a concert or a game. Unmanaged, this will happen very slowly. In China, retail tra�c\nsix weeks after stores reopened is reported to be only about half of where it was\npreviously.\nAfter 9/11, the rollout of the TSA was critical to restoring con�dence in the air tra�c system.\nIt was messy, to be sure, but the existence of tougher screening, more agents, heightened\nvigilance and the like made a real di�erence in convincing people like me that it was safe to\n�y again.\nIs there a way to, similarly, provide customers more reassurance? There are some obvious\nsteps businesses can take, such as enhancing online access, self-checkout, drive through or\ndelivery options. Perhaps governments can publicize “safe protocols.” But more will likely\nbe needed.\nGrocery stores are innovating here. In many, someone meets you in a mask and swipes\ndown your shopping cart, sending a signal that safety is their priority. The aisles aren’t\ncrowded. The cashiers have sneeze guards. The �oors are taped to demonstrate\nappropriate social distancing in line. Seniors have a special time window to shop.\nOther service businesses will need to redesign their models to signal that their experience\nis safe as well. Could restaurants o�er explicit deep cleaning protocols for their tables, less\nserver contact or less dense seating to allay health concerns when eating out? Should\nairlines �y with middle seats empty and boarding/deplaning protocols that preserve social\ndistance? Should personal services pivot to an at-home delivery model? Is there a screening\nprotocol for anyone who enters a hotel or a restaurant or a bar? Many of these changes\ncould increase costs and prices, but they could also reassure the public enough to bring\nbusiness back to life.\nWith rates at zero and �scal support at historic scale, there is signi�cant �nancial stimulus\nto help bring the economy back. But that will only meet its full potential when customers\nare ready to spend. Businesses and governments will need to innovate to make them\ncomfortable doing so.\n\n\fHousehold and Consumer Finance\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Is a Recession Around the Corner?\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nVirginia Bankers Association and Virginia Chamber of Commerce 2020 Financial Forecast\nRichmond, Virginia\nJanuary 9, 2020\n\nThank you very much for inviting me to join you this afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here.\nI’d like to start by telling you a bit about myself, and then I’ll share my perspective on the\nnational economy.\nI joined the Richmond Fed two years ago after a 30-year career in consulting at\nMcKinsey, where I was our CFO and led our offices in the South. I’ve spent my professional life\nhelping firms make decisions about hiring, compensation and prices, and I’ve made a lot of those\ndecisions myself. So I hope I’m bringing a different perspective to the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC). My colleagues on the committee are some of the most talented\nmacroeconomists, bankers, academics and financial regulators in the country. But as the only\ncommittee member coming from management, I approach things differently.\nTo help inform my perspective, I’ve made it a priority to travel throughout the Richmond\nFed’s district, talking to business and community leaders to make sure I’m in close touch with\nwhat’s happening in our economy. Our district spans from Maryland to the Carolinas, but\nRichmond is our hometown, so I really appreciate the opportunity to meet with groups like this\nand hear your reactions and questions.\nToday, I want to focus on a question I hear a lot: Is there a recession around the corner?\nThis is a reasonable question to ask. After all, at more than 10 years, the current upturn is the\nlongest on record. They call it the business “cycle” for a reason—at some point things are going\n-1-\n\n\fto turn back down, aren’t they? We’ve also seen yield curve inversions recently, which\nhistorically have been very good predictors of a recession. And, after more than a year of\nrelatively strong GDP growth, the economy has slowed recently, toward around 2 percent.\nWhen it comes to answering this question, economists are notoriously bad at predicting\nthe future. Fortunately, I’m not an economist… but it’s not clear that businesspeople are that\ngreat at it either. At the end of 2018, nearly half of CFOs in the Duke CFO survey were\npredicting a recession by the end of 2019—one that hasn’t yet happened. As Yogi Berra\nfamously said, “It’s tough to make predictions—especially about the future.”\nBut I’m here and I have a microphone so let me try to answer anyway. Before I say more,\nhowever, I have to note that the views I express are my own and not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nCurrent Signs of Economic Strength\nNow, it’s true that this has been a long expansion. But expansions don’t die of old age;\nthey die of heart attacks. One pundit once said, about the Volcker years, that the Fed murders\nthem.\nLook at the recessions over the past 40 years. In the early 1980s, the Fed’s policies to\ntame runaway inflation caused two recessions back-to-back. A decade later, the savings and loan\ncrisis and an oil price shock led to the 1991 recession. The dot-com bust and the tragedy of Sept.\n11 precipitated the recession in 2001, and the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing financial\nmeltdown created the Great Recession in 2007-09. None of these were a situation where we\ngradually drifted into a recession—to find one like that you’d have to go back to the 1970s.\n\n-2-\n\n\fIn fact, along many dimensions the economy looks quite healthy. First and foremost, the\nlabor market is very strong. The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in November—the lowest\nrate since 1969—and the economy added 266,000 jobs. There are about 1 million more job\nopenings than job seekers. Consequently, we’re seeing employers willing to take a chance on\npeople they might have passed over a few years ago. And wage growth is picking up—earnings\nhave increased 3.1 percent over the past 12 months and even more for lower-paying jobs. At the\nsame time, inflation is low and stable at around 1.6 percent. The resulting increase in real wages\nmatters.\nThe strength of the labor market helps consumers feel confident: They have jobs, and\ntheir earnings are increasing. Credit markets are open. Both consumer spending and saving are\nstrong.\nI did mention that GDP growth has slowed. But “slowing” isn’t the same as\n“underperforming.” Why is that? To put it very simply, economic growth depends on how many\npeople are working and how productive they are. That means the economy can only grow as\nquickly as workforce growth plus productivity growth. Productivity growth averaged just 1\npercent between 2013 and 2018. Over the same period, workforce growth averaged 0.8 percent.\nAdding these up, we’d predict GDP growth of around 2 percent—which is right where we are.\nTo me, the current numbers suggest we’re converging to normal levels rather than\nunderperforming.\nWould I like to see faster GDP growth? Of course. That requires boosting productivity\ngrowth or increasing the size of the workforce. To achieve the latter, we need to either draw\npeople off the sidelines of the labor force or increase immigration, which has contributed to\n\n-3-\n\n\fabout half of workforce growth since the 1990s. These topics are beyond the scope of my\nremarks today, but they’re important for policymakers to pay attention to. 2\nThe upshot is that the economy is growing at about the rate we would expect it to grow.\n\nThe Future: The Upside\nOf course, today isn’t a promise of tomorrow. Let me tell a cautionary tale: During the\nyear preceding the 1970 recession, GDP growth averaged 3 percent and unemployment averaged\n3.5 percent. Before the 2001 recession, we experienced 3 percent GDP growth and 4 percent\nunemployment. And in the year before home prices peaked in mid-2006, GDP averaged\n3.4 percent and unemployment averaged under 5 percent. Things can change.\nSo what indicators am I watching for signs that a change might be coming? I pay a lot of\nattention to what consumers are spending on big ticket items, because consumer spending is\nalmost 70 percent of GDP. If you feel unsure about the future, you might delay buying a house or\ncar or new furniture. But right now consumers remain confident and are buying. Real consumer\nspending on durable goods was up 5.6 percent over the previous year in the third quarter of 2019\nand has increased every quarter since 2011. Housing demand is solid: Pending home sales are up\n4.4 percent over the same time last year, and housing starts are trending up. In addition, the\ndemand for automobiles remains strong; vehicle sales reached 17.1 million (at an annual rate) in\nNovember.\nConsumers are willing to spend when they have jobs. Another leading indicator is initial\nclaims for unemployment insurance, which you can think of as a proxy for layoffs. Right now,\ninitial claims are near a 50-year low even though the labor force is larger than ever.\n\n-4-\n\n\fInitial claims are one component of the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index,\nanother measure I watch closely because it has been a good predictor of recessions in the past. 3\nThe index also includes indicators such as new building permits, manufacturing activity and\nconsumer lending. It has declined slightly the past few months, but it’s still well above the levels\nthat would indicate a recession is on the horizon.\n\nThe Future: The Downside\nThe data I’ve described so far point to continued growth. But you might feel less\noptimistic looking at the yield curve, which, as I noted, has inverted several times recently. It’s\ntrue that an inverted yield curve has preceded recessions in the past—but it doesn’t cause\nrecessions. If underlying economic conditions change, so could the meaning of the signal. For\nexample, recent research by the Richmond Fed found that term premiums (the compensation one\nreceives or pays for locking up their funds for a period of time) have fallen significantly since the\n1980s. This makes the yield curve structurally flatter, and therefore makes an inversion more\nlikely even if no recession is coming. We could also be seeing international savings move toward\nhigher-yielding U.S. Treasury bills at a time when negative interest rates make their home\ngovernment bonds relatively unattractive. I think the current behavior of the yield curve reflects\nthe flow of funds rather than a looming recession.\nSome observers also are concerned about recent contractions in manufacturing activity,\nas measured by declines in the ISM’s Purchasing Managers Index. But we saw similar dips in\n2012 and 2015, after which activity rebounded, and the index is still well above the level that\nindicates the economy as a whole is contracting. In addition, manufacturing has declined\nconsiderably as a share of nominal GDP (from about 30 percent in the early 1950s to 12 percent\n\n-5-\n\n\fin 2015) and as a share of employment (from 30 percent to just 8 percent). So it might not have\nthe same explanatory power.\nNow, business investment is an area I watch closely, and that I do worry about. It has\nbeen weak recently, falling 3 percent in the third quarter of 2019.\nWhat explains that weakness? In my view, it’s uncertainty. Between Brexit, the Middle\nEast, immigration and the ongoing negotiations with China—to name just a few—it’s been a\nroller coaster both here and abroad. Economists from Northwestern, Stanford and the University\nof Chicago have developed an “economic uncertainty index” that gauges the degree of\nuncertainty in 24 different countries. The “global” index hit its all-time high in August, and it\nremains elevated. 4\nAdd political polarization and regulatory uncertainty to the mix and it’s tough for\nbusinesses to feel like they’re on solid ground—and how can you invest when you don’t know\nthe rules? Uncertainty can also make firms less confident about hiring and pricing. So I don’t\ndiscount the idea that we could talk ourselves into a recession, particularly if the uncertainty\nbegins to affect consumer confidence and spending. 5\nAnd of course there’s always the possibility of a “heart attack,” or shock, perhaps caused\nby global risks. Imagine an escalation with Iran or a collapse in international economies.\nFinancial risks are also worth watching: Markets recently hit their all-time highs. In addition,\ncorporate debt has increased significantly at the same time the covenants governing those loans\nhave become more lax. Between 70 and 75 percent of these loans are not on banks’ books, which\nmeans regulators have very little visibility into the potential risks.\nAnother area where regulators lack full visibility is cybersecurity, and these risks keep me up\nat night too.\n\n-6-\n\n\fImplications for Policy\nSo far I’ve described an economy that looks healthy in many respects, although we face\nsome downside risks and potential shocks. In this context, what should policymakers do?\nThe FOMC bought some “insurance,” as Chair Powell has described it, against the\nuncertainty last year by lowering the fed funds target rate 75 basis points. I think we’re seeing\nthis insurance pay off through the traditional channels, such as auto and home sales.\nPolicymakers are also continuing to promote financial stability. We’ve made a lot of progress\nover the past decade, but we need to continue to be proactive about monitoring the risks we\nmight face in the future.\nThe current environment makes it even more important to step up on the fiscal side. By\nthis, I don’t mean using the traditional levers of spending and taxation. Today, I think we have to\nbroaden the definition of fiscal policy to incorporate the climate for business. That includes trade\nactions and trade uncertainty, regulatory changes and regulatory uncertainty, geopolitical\nchallenges and domestic politics. In my view, the biggest boost to our economy would come\nfrom lessening the uncertainty and lowering the volume. I am hopeful that the recent election in\nthe United Kingdom, the passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)\nand the trade deal with China will do that. That would build business confidence, build consumer\nconfidence and lead to increased investment, spending and hiring. I like to say that American\nbusinesses are creative.

            "content": "Is a Recession Around the Corner?\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nMaryland Bankers Association First Friday Economic Outlook Forum\nBaltimore, Maryland\nJanuary 3, 2020\n\nThank you very much for inviting me to join you this morning. It’s a pleasure to have the\nopportunity to speak with you again. With apologies to those of you who heard me speak last\nyear, I’d like to start by telling you a bit about myself, and then I’ll share my perspective on the\nnational economy.\nI joined the Richmond Fed two years ago after a 30-year career in consulting at\nMcKinsey, where I was our CFO and led our offices in the South. I’ve spent my professional life\nhelping firms make decisions about hiring, compensation and prices, and I’ve made a lot of those\ndecisions myself. So I hope I’m bringing a different perspective to the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC). My colleagues on the committee are some of the most talented\nmacroeconomists, bankers, academics and financial regulators in the country. But as the only\ncommittee member coming from management, I approach things differently.\nTo help inform my perspective, I’ve made it a priority to travel throughout the Richmond\nFed’s district, talking to business and community leaders to make sure I’m in close touch with\nwhat’s happening in our economy. I’m in Maryland a lot, and I really appreciate the opportunity\nto meet with groups like this and hear your reactions and questions.\nToday, I want to focus on a question I hear a lot: Is there a recession around the corner?\nThis is a reasonable question to ask. After all, at more than 10 years, the current upturn is the\nlongest on record. They call it the business “cycle” for a reason—at some point things are going\n-1-\n\n\fto turn back down, aren’t they? We’ve also seen yield curve inversions recently, which\nhistorically have been very good predictors of a recession. And, after more than a year of\nrelatively strong GDP growth, the economy has slowed recently, toward around 2 percent.\nWhen it comes to answering this question, economists are notoriously bad at predicting\nthe future. Fortunately, I’m not an economist… but it’s not clear that businesspeople are that\ngreat at it either. At the end of 2018, nearly half of CFOs in the Duke CFO survey were\npredicting a recession by the end of 2019—one that hasn’t yet happened. As Yogi Berra\nfamously said, “It’s tough to make predictions—especially about the future.”\nBut I’m here and I have a microphone so let me try to answer anyway. Before I say more,\nhowever, I have to note that the views I express are my own and not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nCurrent Signs of Economic Strength\nNow, it’s true that this has been a long expansion. But expansions don’t die of old age;\nthey die of heart attacks. One pundit once said, about the Volcker years, that the Fed murders\nthem.\nLook at the recessions over the past 40 years. In the early 1980s, the Fed’s policies to\ntame runaway inflation caused two recessions back-to-back. A decade later, the savings and loan\ncrisis and an oil price shock led to the 1991 recession. The dot-com bust and the tragedy of Sept.\n11 precipitated the recession in 2001, and the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing financial\nmeltdown created the Great Recession in 2007-09. None of these were a situation where we\ngradually drifted into a recession—to find one like that you’d have to go back to the 1970s.\n\n-2-\n\n\fIn fact, along many dimensions the economy looks quite healthy. First and foremost, the\nlabor market is very strong. The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in November—the lowest\nrate since 1969—and the economy added 266,000 jobs. There are about 1 million more job\nopenings than job seekers. Consequently, we’re seeing employers willing to take a chance on\npeople they might have passed over a few years ago. And wage growth is picking up—earnings\nhave increased 3.1 percent over the past 12 months and even more for lower-paying jobs. At the\nsame time, inflation is low and stable at around 1.6 percent. The resulting increase in real wages\nmatters.\nThe strength of the labor market helps consumers feel confident: They have jobs, and\ntheir earnings are increasing. Credit markets are open. Both consumer spending and saving are\nstrong.\nI did mention that GDP growth has slowed. But “slowing” isn’t the same as\n“underperforming.” Why is that? To put it very simply, economic growth depends on how many\npeople are working and how productive they are. That means the economy can only grow as\nquickly as workforce growth plus productivity growth. Productivity growth averaged just 1\npercent between 2013 and 2018. Over the same period, workforce growth averaged 0.8 percent.\nAdding these up, we’d predict GDP growth of around 2 percent—which is right where we are.\nTo me, the current numbers suggest we’re converging to normal levels rather than\nunderperforming.\nWould I like to see faster GDP growth? Of course. That requires boosting productivity\ngrowth or increasing the size of the workforce. To achieve the latter, we need to either draw\npeople off the sidelines of the labor force or increase immigration, which has contributed to\n\n-3-\n\n\fabout half of workforce growth since the 1990s. These topics are beyond the scope of my\nremarks today, but they’re important for policymakers to pay attention to. 2\nThe upshot is that the economy is growing at about the rate we would expect it to grow.\n\nThe Future: The Upside\nOf course, today isn’t a promise of tomorrow. Let me tell a cautionary tale: During the\nyear preceding the 1970 recession, GDP growth averaged 3 percent and unemployment averaged\n3.5 percent. Before the 2001 recession, we experienced 3 percent GDP growth and 4 percent\nunemployment. And in the year before home prices peaked in mid-2006, GDP averaged\n3.4 percent and unemployment averaged under 5 percent. Things can change.\nSo what indicators am I watching for signs that a change might be coming? I pay a lot of\nattention to what consumers are spending on big ticket items, because consumer spending is\nalmost 70 percent of GDP. If you feel unsure about the future, you might delay buying a house or\ncar or new furniture. But right now consumers remain confident and are buying. Real consumer\nspending on durable goods was up 5.6 percent over the previous year in the third quarter of 2019\nand has increased every quarter since 2011. Housing demand is solid: Pending home sales are up\n4.4 percent over the same time last year, and housing starts are trending up. In addition, the\ndemand for automobiles remains strong; vehicle sales reached 17.1 million (at an annual rate) in\nNovember.\nConsumers are willing to spend when they have jobs. Another leading indicator is initial\nclaims for unemployment insurance, which you can think of as a proxy for layoffs. Right now,\ninitial claims are near a 50-year low even though the labor force is larger than ever.\n\n-4-\n\n\fInitial claims are one component of the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index,\nanother measure I watch closely because it has been a good predictor of recessions in the past. 3\nThe index also includes indicators such as new building permits, manufacturing activity and\nconsumer lending. It has declined slightly the past few months, but it’s still well above the levels\nthat would indicate a recession is on the horizon.\n\nThe Future: The Downside\nThe data I’ve described so far point to continued growth. But you might feel less\noptimistic looking at the yield curve, which, as I noted, has inverted several times recently. It’s\ntrue that an inverted yield curve has preceded recessions in the past—but it doesn’t cause\nrecessions. If underlying economic conditions change, so could the meaning of the signal. For\nexample, recent research by the Richmond Fed found that term premiums (the compensation one\nreceives or pays for locking up their funds for a period of time) have fallen significantly since the\n1980s. This makes the yield curve structurally flatter, and therefore makes an inversion more\nlikely even if no recession is coming. We could also be seeing international savings move toward\nhigher-yielding U.S. Treasury bills at a time when negative interest rates make their home\ngovernment bonds relatively unattractive. I think the current behavior of the yield curve reflects\nthe flow of funds rather than a looming recession.\nSome observers also are concerned about recent contractions in manufacturing activity,\nas measured by declines in the ISM’s Purchasing Managers Index. But we saw similar dips in\n2012 and 2015, after which activity rebounded, and the index is still well above the level that\nindicates the economy as a whole is contracting. In addition, manufacturing has declined\nconsiderably as a share of nominal GDP (from about 30 percent in the early 1950s to 12 percent\n\n-5-\n\n\fin 2015) and as a share of employment (from 30 percent to just 8 percent). So it might not have\nthe same explanatory power.\nNow, business investment is an area I watch closely, and that I do worry about. It has\nbeen weak recently, falling 3 percent in the third quarter of 2019.\nWhat explains that weakness? In my view, it’s uncertainty. Between Brexit, the Middle\nEast, immigration and the ongoing negotiations with China—to name just a few—it’s been a\nroller coaster both here and abroad. Economists from Northwestern, Stanford and the University\nof Chicago have developed an “economic uncertainty index” that gauges the degree of\nuncertainty in 24 different countries. The “global” index hit its all-time high in August, and it\nremains elevated. 4\nAdd political polarization and regulatory uncertainty to the mix and it’s tough for\nbusinesses to feel like they’re on solid ground—and how can you invest when you don’t know\nthe rules? Uncertainty can also make firms less confident about hiring and pricing. So I don’t\ndiscount the idea that we could talk ourselves into a recession, particularly if the uncertainty\nbegins to affect consumer confidence and spending. 5\nAnd of course there’s always the possibility of a “heart attack,” or shock, perhaps caused\nby global risks. Imagine an escalation with Iran or a collapse in international economies.\nFinancial risks are also worth watching: Markets recently hit their all-time highs. In addition,\ncorporate debt has increased significantly at the same time the covenants governing those loans\nhave become more lax. Between 70 and 75 percent of these loans are not on banks’ books, which\nmeans regulators have very little visibility into the potential risks.\nAnother area where regulators lack full visibility is cybersecurity, and these risks keep me up\nat night too.\n\n-6-\n\n\fImplications for Policy\nSo far I’ve described an economy that looks healthy in many respects, although we face\nsome downside risks and potential shocks. In this context, what should policymakers do?\nThe FOMC bought some “insurance,” as Chair Powell has described it, against the\nuncertainty last year by lowering the fed funds target rate 75 basis points. I think we’re seeing\nthis insurance pay off through the traditional channels, such as auto and home sales.\nPolicymakers are also continuing to promote financial stability. We’ve made a lot of progress\nover the past decade, but we need to continue to be proactive about monitoring the risks we\nmight face in the future.\nThe current environment makes it even more important to step up on the fiscal side. By\nthis, I don’t mean using the traditional levers of spending and taxation. Today, I think we have to\nbroaden the definition of fiscal policy to incorporate the climate for business. That includes trade\nactions and trade uncertainty, regulatory changes and regulatory uncertainty, geopolitical\nchallenges and domestic politics. In my view, the biggest boost to our economy would come\nfrom lessening the uncertainty and lowering the volume. I am hopeful that the recent election in\nthe United Kingdom, the passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)\nand the trade deal with China will do that. That would build business confidence, build consumer\nconfidence and lead to increased investment, spending and hiring. I like to say that American\nbusinesses are creative. Give them the rules—almost any set of rules—and they will make things\nhappen. We’ve seen that with Brexit. Three years ago, the current path was projected to be\neconomically destructive. But you see the positive reaction with the election—businesses just\nwant to know the rules.\n\n-7-\n\n\fNet, the economy is still healthy. I’m encouraged by recent jobs reports and the pace of\nholiday spending. I’m hopeful recent events will lessen uncertainty and build confidence. While\nthere is always the risk of a shock, the Fed has done a lot to support the economy’s continued\nexpansion and to provide buffers against the downside.\nI would note that recession isn’t inevitable. Australia has gone 27 years without one.

Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nGreensboro Chamber of Commerce Economic Forecast Luncheon\nGreensboro, North Carolina\nNovember 13, 2019\n\nThank you very much for inviting me to join you this afternoon. Today, I’d like to talk with you\nabout how I interpret current economic data through the lens of monetary policy. Please note that\nthe views I express are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nEconomic Outlook\nBefore I talk about the data, let me say a few words about my background and perspective. I\njoined the Richmond Fed almost two years ago after a 30-year career in consulting at McKinsey,\nwhere I had roles including chief financial officer and leading our offices in the South. I’ve spent\nmy professional life helping firms make decisions about hiring, compensation and prices, and\nI’ve made a lot of those decisions myself. So I hope I’m bringing a different perspective to the\nFOMC. My colleagues on the committee are some of the most talented macroeconomists,\nbankers, academics and financial regulators in the country. But as the only committee member\ncoming from management, I approach things differently.\n\nSo what am I seeing? Overall, I believe the economy remains healthy. GDP growth was\n1.9 percent in the third quarter. It has averaged 2.3 percent year to date, which is above the trend\nof around 2 percent you’d estimate from the sum of population and productivity growth.\n\n-1-\n\n\fThat growth is being strongly supported by consumers. Households are spending, and that’s\nimportant because consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of GDP. Housing demand\nhas rebounded over the past several months, and auto spending has continued to be strong. Both\nof these are reliable indicators of the strength of consumer mindsets. And even with some recent\ndrops, consumer confidence is near all-time highs.\n\nWhat’s behind that confidence? Primarily, it’s the strength of the labor market. The\nunemployment rate is near a 50-year low, at just 3.6 percent in October. In fact, there are roughly\n1 million more job openings than there are people looking for work; and there have been more\njobs than job seekers since March of last year, the first time that’s happened in the 20-year\nhistory of this data series. Initial claims for unemployment insurance, a rough measure of layoffs,\nare as low as they’ve been since the late 1960s in absolute numbers, despite population growth.\nAnd wages are increasing while inflation remains muted. In October, wages were up 3 percent\nover the year before, while inflation has been running around 1.7 percent, just under our\n2 percent target. These increases in real wages matter.\n\nAlthough job growth has slowed some, which you’d expect to see as we near trend and markets\ntighten, we’re still averaging nearly 170,000 new jobs per month this year. That’s above\n“breakeven”—the Atlanta Fed estimates we need 107,000 jobs per month to maintain current\nunemployment levels. So, the economy remains sound.\n\n-2-\n\n\fThere are headwinds, though, mostly driven by uncertainty around trade and politics. Between\nBrexit, the Middle East, immigration, and the ongoing negotiations with China—to name just a\nfew—it’s been a roller coaster both here and abroad. And we’re seeing international economies\nstruggle. GDP growth has slowed in China and stalled in the eurozone. In the second quarter,\ngrowth was actually negative in Germany, Europe’s largest economy. There’s a risk that\nweakness will affect us. Here at home, manufacturing activity has slowed amid trade concerns.\n\nAgainst this background, it’s not surprising that we’ve seen weakness in business investment. It\nshrank 3 percent in the third quarter. And the bond market has sent some concerning signals\nlately. The yield on 10-year Treasuries has been very low given the overall strength of the\neconomy and has actually been lower at times than the yield on 2-year Treasuries. As you\nprobably know, such an inversion of the yield curve is historically a good predictor of a\nrecession. But is that what the yield curve is signaling now, or are we just seeing a move toward\nhigher-yielding safe assets at a time when international rates are historically low?\n\nOverall, I think it’s safe to say the economy is giving us conflicting signals. The strength of\nconsumption and the labor market might be saying “hold” or even “raise rates,” while the\nsoftness of investment, inflation and the bond market might be saying “lower rates.” How have\npolicymakers thought about it?\n\nIn 2018, the risk seemed to be the economy “overheating.” With interest rates well below\n“normal” levels, strong GDP growth, fiscal stimulus and a tight labor market, we raised the\ntarget rate four times, with many FOMC participants projecting additional rate increases the\n\n-3-\n\n\ffollowing year. But in early 2019, political and global turmoil signaled more risk to the\ndownside. The committee decided to pause and take a patient approach, with a much flatter\nprojected rate path.\n\nThen, with inflation muted, continued uncertainty and international weakness, we lowered the\ntarget rate 75 basis points over the past three meetings. The FOMC’s decision to lower rates\ndoesn’t mean a recession is imminent. But it does reflect the fact that there is a lot of uncertainty\nabout the outlook, particularly with respect to global growth and the impact of trade. So it seems\nprudent to take out some “insurance,” as Chair Powell said in July. A year ago, FOMC\nparticipants were projecting 2020 rates more than 130 basis points higher than their most recent\n[SEP] projections. That’s powerful support for our economy.\n\nThe New Environment\nNow, let’s take a step back from the data and recognize that monetary policy is operating in a\nnew and different environment.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? When I was in school, I learned about both monetary policy and fiscal\npolicy. The key fiscal policy levers were spending and taxation. But today, I think we have to\nbroaden the definition of fiscal policy to incorporate the climate for business. That includes trade\nactions and trade uncertainty, regulatory changes and regulatory uncertainty, geopolitical\nchallenges and domestic politics.\n\n-4-\n\n\fWith the roller coaster I mentioned, it’s been tough for businesses to feel like they’re on solid\nground. Economists from Northwestern, Stanford and the University of Chicago have developed\nan “economic uncertainty index” that gauges the degree of uncertainty in 24 different countries.\nTheir “global” index hit its all-time high in August.2 In the third quarter Duke CFO survey, more\nthan half of CFOs said they were less optimistic about the U.S. economy than they had been the\nprevious quarter.\n\nThe climate for business is already a challenge. Tariffs are taxes and—unless businesses shift\ntheir supply chains—impose direct costs on target industries. International economies are\nstruggling as they try to adapt to changes in the global trade regime that the United States created\nafter World War II. When financial markets react to the news cycle, as they did earlier this year,\nyou see an impact on consumer spending. And health care regulation has to be affecting health\ncare firms’ investment plans.\n\nUncertainty is having an impact too. Uncertainty raises the threshold for action.3 It dampens\nbusiness confidence, which can lead to lower investment, less hiring and potentially even less\nconfidence in pricing. After all, how can you invest when you don’t know the rules? Hearkening\nback to my days as a CFO, I think of it as equivalent to an increase in investment hurdle rates.\nFirms today are frustrated with political polarization and uncertainty about regulation. They tell\nme they’re not scaling back yet, but they’re reluctant to double down. For these reasons, I don’t\ndiscount the idea that we could talk ourselves into a recession—particularly if the uncertainty\nbegins to affect consumer confidence and spending.\n\n-5-\n\n\fUncertainty also lessens the effectiveness of traditional policy, both fiscal and monetary. For\nexample, the country is running historically large deficits, and Congress passed a significant tax\ncut in late 2017. Normally, one would imagine these traditional fiscal policy levers should boost\nthe economy. In early 2018, we did see strong growth and an investment boom. But those\nnumbers dropped quickly as trade concerns came to dominate the headlines and outweighed the\nimpetus from fiscal stimulus.\n\nTurning to monetary policy, uncertainty can also dampen the impact we might expect from any\npolicy “stance.” We typically think that accommodative monetary policy stimulates the\neconomy. But in the presence of high uncertainty—nearly all of which is generated by forces\nextraneous to what the FOMC does—we risk not getting the same “bang for the buck.” The\nstimulus could be outweighed by perceived risks to future cash flows. We might also view an\naccommodative monetary policy stance as powerful in shaping financial market valuations. But\nagain, high uncertainty scrambles the signals. Financial markets are being moved by trade these\ndays rather than by our policy stance.\n\nPolicy Options\nIf the current uncertainty is temporary, then the right course of action is to see through it the way\nwe might see through movements in the more volatile components of inflation. The divergence\nwe see between strong consumption and weaker investment may well be signaling that the\nuncertainty won’t persist. The recent headway made on trade negotiations may lessen our\ndownside, as might the progress being made in the Brexit negotiations.\n\n-6-\n\n\fBut if we’re in a more uncertain environment for the long term, we’ll have to recognize that even\nthough we have tools to use, they’re potentially less effective. For that reason, I’m closely\nmonitoring whether the recent “insurance” the FOMC purchased will have its intended effect.\n\nMore broadly, the Fed is undertaking a review to ask if we have the right monetary policy\nstrategy and tools to achieve our dual mandate, given low inflation and the risk of returning to\nthe zero lower bound in the current environment. A number of topics are on the table, including\n“makeup” strategies for inflation shortfalls, balance sheet policies, forward guidance and\ncommunications strategies.\n\nI won’t go into detail about these various options today, but I will say that in general I’m hopeful\nwe can develop a portfolio of tools to help us support the economy, as I’m skeptical that any one\ntool can truly overcome significant fiscal headwinds.\n\nThat’s why, in my view, it’s even more important to step up on the fiscal side and improve the\nclimate for business. The biggest boost to our economy would come from lessening the\nuncertainty and lowering the volume. That would build business confidence, build consumer\nconfidence and lead to increased investment, spending and hiring. Look at the market reaction\nwhen it seemed like there was a Brexit deal. Originally, leaving the eurozone was viewed as a\ncalamitous choice. Now, markets are so relieved that the rules are clear, they reward the\ndecision. American businesses are creative. Give them the rules—almost any set of rules—and\nthey will make things happen.\n\n-7-\n\n\fThe Future\nWhere do we go from here? I actually don’t have an answer to that question. But I think we face\nthree meaningful conflicts that I am watching closely. First, U.S. consumer spending is strong,\nbut U.S. investment is weak. The leading indicators are still robust, as I said, but will that remain\nthe case if business investment weakens further? Second, the U.S. economy is strong, but\ninternational economies are weak. I heard an economist say that historically, we don’t import\nrecessions—we export them. But will that still be the case in our increasingly globally connected\neconomy? Third, the bond market is pessimistic, but the stock market is still upbeat. Experience\nsays to listen to the bond market—but is the bond market sending us the same signals it used to\nwhen rates are so low?\n\nThose are enough questions from me. Now, I’d love to hear yours.\n1\n\nThank you to Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nScott R. Baker, Nicholas Bloom, and Steven J.

It’s a pleasure to be here in the Dan River\nregion, and I’m looking forward to a series of discussions about the impressive suite of actions\nyou’ve taken to rebuild your economy.\n\nI came to Richmond almost two years ago. In that time, I’ve been very much “on the ground” to\nlearn about the communities in the Fed’s Fifth District, which spans from Maryland to the\nCarolinas. As I’ve traveled, I’ve seen areas that are thriving and areas that are struggling. I think\nthe Fed has a real opportunity—and responsibility—to make a difference, particularly with\nrespect to labor market outcomes. That’s why I’m excited to learn more about what you’re\ndoing.\n\nThe focus today is “what’s around the corner” in workforce development. I’ll leave to our\ndistinguished panelists the topics of the jobs of the future and how to train people for those jobs.\nInstead, I want to talk with you about what has to be “around the corner” if we are to grow our\neconomy—and that’s helping recruit into jobs people who have left the workforce. Maybe they\nlack the skills they need. Maybe they’re in poor health. Maybe they’re making ends meet\nthrough benefits they’re scared of losing. Maybe they’re struggling with addiction. Maybe\nthey’re discouraged about the jobs they’re qualified to do. What can we do to bring these people\n\n-1-\n\n\foff the sidelines and back into the game? That would be the ultimate workforce development\nplan.\n\nBefore I say more about my perspectives on this, note that the views I express are my own and\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System. 1\n\nWho’s on the Sidelines?\nLet’s start with looking at who these people are.\n\nIt won’t be news to you that the labor market is tight. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year\nlow, at 3.6 percent. The rate is the same here in Pittsylvania County. Across our country, there\nare currently 7 million jobs available—and only 5.9 million people looking for work. In fact,\nthere have been more job openings than job seekers since March of last year. It’s the first time\nwe’ve been in this situation in the nearly 20-year history of this data series.\n\nBut the unemployment rate only tells you about people who are looking for work. More than six\ntimes as many people are of what we’d consider the relevant age for work but aren’t looking. So\nlet’s dig into those numbers. According to census data, around 3.5 million prime-age people (that\nis, people between the ages of 25 and 54) are looking for work and are therefore counted as\nunemployed. But 22.4 million prime-age people are not working and are not looking for work.\nWhen you add it up, we have 25.8 million prime-age people, or 20 percent of that population,\nwho, for some reason, are not working; the rates are about 10 percentage points higher in smaller\n\n-2-\n\n\ftowns. 2 About two-thirds of those not working are women and around half have a high school\neducation or less. People not working also are disproportionately people of color. 3\n\nThe numbers look different in other countries. For example, if we had the same percentage of\nprime-age people working as in the United Kingdom, we would have around 5 million more\npeople in the labor force. That would imply 5 percent more growth potential in our economy. 4\n\nNot every person out of the labor force wants to be in it, or should be. About 10 percent of this\ngroup is in school, gaining skills that will help them succeed in the workforce in the future.\nAnother 35 percent are caring for children or other family members, a personal choice they’ve\nmade—and by the way, a contribution to the economy that our metrics don’t measure. 5 But that\nstill leaves more than half of this group, or more than 14 million people.\n\nWhat’s holding them back? Pulling together analyses from multiple economists gives us a hint,\nrecognizing these numbers overlap. Just under half of the remainder (24.4 percent of the total, or\n6.3 million) report that they have a health problem or disability that keeps them from working or\nlimits the work they can do. Four million prime-age adults are receiving Social Security\nDisability Income benefits, and over 2 million receive Supplemental Security Income. 6 In\naddition, there is research suggesting that the increase in opioid prescriptions between 1999 and\n2015 drove down the labor force participation rate, particularly for prime-age men. 7\n\n-3-\n\n\fThere may also be some people who are not counted as working by the official statistics but who\nare working informally. Boston Fed researchers have estimated that in 2015, 28 percent of\n“unemployed” workers and 17 percent of those not in the labor force were working in the gig\neconomy, although they typically only worked a few hours per week and earned less than $350\nper month. 8\n\nWhat Jobs Are Available?\nSo we know there are millions of people not working—but there are also lots of jobs going\nunfilled. In every town I visit, I hear stories about restaurants and homebuilders and nursing\nhomes that can’t find workers. Where’s the disconnect?\n\nPart of the issue might be that many of the available jobs aren’t that attractive. According to data\nfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 63 percent of employment is in occupations that are\nlow skill, meaning they don’t require more than a high school education, and 45 percent is in\njobs that pay a median wage of $35,000 or less per year. These jobs, such as food service\nworkers and personal care aides, are predicted to have high growth. We see this in the Dan River\narea as well. Last year, the majority of job openings in the Dan River region required a high\nschool degree or less and over 60 percent paid less than $13/hour. 9\n\nThese jobs often have other shortcomings in addition to low pay, such as unpredictable\nschedules, difficult working environments and hours that can fail to meet employees’ needs. In\naddition, the industries in which these low-skill jobs are the most prevalent are the least likely to\noffer employer-based health insurance. For example, only 35 percent of firms in the retail\n\n-4-\n\n\findustry offer health insurance benefits, compared with 57 percent of all firms. It’s even worse\nfor part-time and temporary workers. Only 28 percent of firms offer health insurance to\nemployees who work less than 30 hours per week and, not surprisingly, just 7 percent offer it to\ntemporary workers.\n\nEven when employers do offer health insurance, many workers don’t take advantage of it—often\nbecause it’s more than they can afford. In 2019, the average premium at firms where at least 35\npercent of workers earn $25,000 or less annually was $515 per month for an individual and\n$1,469 month for a family. 10 For a family of four with an annual household income of $50,000,\nthat’s 35 percent of their monthly income.\n\nAnother shortcoming is that many low-wage jobs aren’t very stable. Industries such as leisure\nand hospitality, food services and retail trade have high turnover rates. 11 There’s also a question\nabout the long-term stability of these jobs, as automation may displace many low-skill workers\nin the coming decades. It’s already started—in many fast food restaurants, for example, it’s\npossible to place your order through a kiosk. My former colleagues at the McKinsey Global\nInstitute predict that by 2030, 38 percent of food service jobs and 24 percent of customer service\nand sales jobs could be displaced by automation. 12\n\nIdentifying the Mismatches\nWhat would it take to put these on-the-sidelines workers into the available jobs?\n\n-5-\n\n\fPart of the story is skill mismatch, as my colleague Mary Daly of the San Francisco Fed recently\ndiscussed. 13 Twenty-six percent of employment is in higher-skilled jobs, meaning they require a\nbachelor’s or higher. Employers are finding it difficult to find employees with the relevant talent\nin fields like technology and nursing. Improving K-12 education, leveraging community\ncolleges, increasing college completion rates and classic workforce training concepts, like those\nbeing discussed today, are necessary.\n\nWe also hear a lot about location mismatch. The McKinsey study I just mentioned also predicted\nthat the most job growth will occur in the nation’s 25 most prosperous cities, while smaller\ntowns are at risk of losing more jobs. It’s easy to say, “Well, people should just move to where\nthe jobs are.” But rising costs of living in big cities, especially for housing, have often more than\noffset the urban wage premium for low-skill work. So for many nonemployed workers, it may\nnot make sense to leave a hometown that has a relatively low cost of living, not to mention a\nsupport network of friends and family, for a low-pay job in a high-cost city.\n\nI also want to talk about three other issues that don’t get as much attention: health, incentives and\njob attractiveness.\n\nWhen it comes to health, I’ve mentioned the role that opioid addiction may play in labor force\nparticipation, and I’m intrigued by innovative addiction-to-work programs. But there are many\nother health issues going on as well. The relationship between unemployment and poor health is\nwell-documented, and prime-age individuals who are not in the labor force are far more likely to\nreport poor or fair health than those who are employed or even unemployed. More than one-third\n\n-6-\n\n\fof prime-age men out of the labor force report a disability, compared with 6 percent of prime-age\nunemployed men and 2.6 percent of prime-age employed men. 14 And more than one-third of\nnonworking, nonelderly Medicaid recipients report living with multiple chronic conditions. 15\n\nAt the same time, hospitals are closing, especially in rural markets, and health care is becoming\never more expensive. How can we return people to health and to the workforce? There are\ncommunity groups that recognize that you can’t grow a talented workforce without a healthy\npopulation, such as the Health Collaborative here in Danville and Active SWV, a nonprofit\nbuilding an ecosystem of physical activity in the community. The Health Collaborative has\nvolunteers focusing on healthy eating, active living, access to health care and creating healthy\nspaces. It currently has more than 90 individuals who represent more than 50 organizations\nspanning local government, education, health care, business and nonprofit sectors. The key for\nthese local success stories is scaling.\n\nNext I want to talk about incentives. Our benefits structure, which provides critical support for\npeople in need, sometimes discourages working. For example, if you aren’t working and are\nreceiving Medicaid, it doesn’t sound very appealing to take a low-wage job that doesn’t offer\naffordable health insurance and that also makes you or your children ineligible for Medicaid or\nthe Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). This situation, which we call a “benefits cliff,”\nis far more likely to occur in states that have not expanded Medicaid. 16\n\nThe structure of disability insurance also creates disincentives for work. That’s because you\nforfeit lifelong benefits if you engage in the workforce—so if you’re on the margin of being able\n\n-7-\n\n\fto work and your choice is between an unstable, low-paying job and a stable (albeit also lowpaying) benefit, it wouldn’t be surprising if you chose the benefit.\n\nOur tax system can also make working relatively unattractive for certain segments of the\npopulation. For example, we have “joint taxation,” which means that the system taxes the first\ndollar earned by the second earner at the same rate as the last dollar earned by the primary\nearner, pushing the household into a higher tax bracket. Add to this the cost of child care and\nother work-related expenses, and a family’s monthly take-home pay might be actually higher if\nthe second earner doesn’t work or works informally. In addition, the Earned Income Tax Credit\nphases out at higher income levels, which could lead someone to conclude that working isn’t\neconomically worth it.\n\nOverall, we have a population with health problems, and they have incentive to stay where they\nare to maintain eligibility for Medicaid, CHIP or disability insurance. Then, they look at the jobs\navailable to them and see unstable jobs, unpredictable hours and low pay. Working doesn’t seem\nlike a very good trade.\n\nWhat can policymakers do to make it a better trade—for the good of the individuals and for the\ngood of our economy as a whole? Fiscal policies are out of the Fed’s purview, and therefore I’m\nnot taking a stand on any particular policy, but the incentive structure warrants re-examination.\nWe do see that Medicaid expansion, for example, which Virginia has already done, changes the\nincentive equation.\n\n-8-\n\n\fFinally, some jobs are going unfilled because they’re viewed as unattractive, for the reasons I’ve\ndiscussed. The pay, the working conditions, the unpredictability or the perceived stability can be\ndeterrents. Or, workers’ prior jobs could have had higher pay or higher status, and they don’t\nwant to take a role they view as a step back. Or embedded perceptions could play a role. More\nthan 60 percent of workers in four of the top five occupations with the most projected growth,\nsuch as personal care aides, are female. Some men might be choosing not to pursue jobs in those\nfields.\n\nThe good news here is that the tightness of the labor market is motivating employers to reexamine the jobs they offer. We see significant wage increases for many entry-level positions; a\nmajor bank, for example, recently announced a $20 minimum wage. We’ve talked to a steel\ncompany air conditioning its plants to make the environment more comfortable, a furniture\ncompany offering hours tailored to primary caregivers and companies being more flexible on\nteleworking. That’s good news. Many economists believe that if we can get people into the labor\nforce, they are likely to stay in the labor force.\n\nJob training and job placement really matter. But in today’s economy, with such a large\npercentage of the potential workforce not working, I also want to make the case that job design,\nworkforce health and incentives to work matter too. As I said at the beginning, that’s the ultimate\nin workforce development.\n\nThank you, and now I look forward to your reactions and questions.\n\n-9-\n\n\fThank you to Abigail Burns, Nina Mantilla and Jessie Romero for their assistance preparing these remarks.\nPrior research we’ve done has found that employment rates are around 10 percentage points lower in smaller\ntowns, based on census data for ages 16-64.\n3\nThough the majority (approximately 51 percent) of prime-age nonemployed individuals are white, non-Hispanic,\npeople of color are nonemployed at higher rates. For prime-age individuals, we calculate that approximately 25\npercent of the black, non-Hispanic population is nonemployed versus only 18 percent of the white, non-Hispanic\npopulation.\n4\nHours worked varies across countries and is not included in the calculation.\n5\nWe estimate 8,947,983.20, or 34.66 percent of prime-age nonemployed (2019), are stay-at-home parents.\n6\nSSI provides disability benefits to people with limited work history.\n7\nAlan B.

            "content": "Moving the Needle in Smaller Towns\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nInvesting in Rural America\nOctober 2, 2019\nHarrisonburg, Virginia\n\nThank you for coming to join us today. Before I say more, note that the views I express are my\nown and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\n\nI came to Richmond a little more than 18 months ago. In that time, I’ve been very much “on the\nground” and have enjoyed the opportunity to dig into the Fed’s Fifth District, which spans from\nMaryland to the Carolinas. It didn’t take me long to learn that we have two economies in our\nDistrict—one in bigger cities and one in smaller towns. Now, I’ve seen small towns that\nrepresent the best of what our country has to offer. But I’ve also seen many communities that\nhave lost ground. I believe the Richmond Fed has an opportunity—and a responsibility—to\ncontribute to the understanding of what is happening and how it might change. That’s why we’re\nsponsoring this conference.\n\nAs Kartik Athreya is going to talk about in more detail, smaller towns are different from bigger\ncities along a variety of dimensions, including demographics, geography and educational\nattainment—all of which contribute to differences in labor market outcomes. Smaller towns also\nhave what we call “thinner” markets, ones with fewer employers. So if dislocation hits even one\nsizable employer, the whole town feels it.\n\n-1-\n\n\fThe solutions will vary from place to place. A coal mining town in West Virginia doesn’t\nnecessarily face the same challenges as one on the Eastern Shore of Maryland or a farm town in\ncentral Virginia. But broadly speaking, research suggests the need to address four core issues to\nmove the needle in these communities: education, connection, isolation and participation.\n\nTheme 1: Education\nLet’s start with the first and arguably the most important—education or, more broadly, preparing\npeople to enter the workforce. On average, people with bachelor’s degrees earn more money, are\nmore likely to be employed and even have better health outcomes.\n\nBut the answer isn’t just to send more kids to college because a large share of students who go\ndon’t graduate. We also have to focus on preparing people for college, and an important place to\nstart is early childhood education. That’s because there’s a tremendous amount of evidence that\n“skills beget skills.” Early childhood lays the foundation for later learning, both “hard” and\n“soft” skills. Many studies have found that children who attend a high-quality preschool are\nlikely to have higher test scores, higher educational attainment, higher adult earnings and lower\nrates of incarceration and teen pregnancy.1 One study suggests that attending pre-K boosts high\nschool graduation rates by 11 percentage points.2\n\nThe availability of early childhood education also matters for parents. Greater access to highquality child care, including full-day preschool, has been shown to increase women’s labor force\nparticipation.3 Yet nearly 60 percent of rural communities have few or no options for licensed\n\n-2-\n\n\fchild care.4 That contributes to a gap between bigger cities and smaller towns. In the Fifth\nDistrict, 20 percent fewer small-town 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in pre-K. While we do have\nmany strong school districts in our region, there are also districts where fewer than 30 percent of\nthird graders can read at grade level and barely 60 percent of students graduate from high\nschool—imagine the possibilities if we could increase these communities’ access to high-quality\nearly childhood education.\n\nOf course, there are serious obstacles to scaling up pre-K, particularly in small towns where\nchildren and families are more dispersed and it might be harder to recruit teachers. But it’s not\nimpossible. Oklahoma and Georgia, for example, have offered nearly universal pre-K for\nroughly two decades, raising preschool enrollment in rural areas by 24 percent.5 In West\nVirginia, pre-K is now offered in all of the state’s 55 counties.\n\nLet me stress, however, that while the return on investment for preschool is quite large, it’s not a\nsilver bullet. Early childhood education is a vital first step. The academic gains of pre-K can fade\nif children subsequently attend lower-quality schools, so we must continue to invest in improving\nK-12 education. And, as I’ll discuss later, communities need to attract and retain educated\nworkers as well.\n\nTheme 2: Connection\nNext, I’d like to talk about connection: facilitating workers’ access to good jobs. I’ve talked\nabout the benefits of obtaining a bachelor’s degree. But a four-year college isn’t necessarily the\nright path for everyone, and there are well-paying jobs that don’t require a four-year degree. As\n\n-3-\n\n\fwe’ll hear more about in the first panel, career and technical education in high school and\ncommunity colleges also are important pieces of the puzzle. They’re relatively low-cost ways for\nstudents to focus their efforts, learn about themselves and get additional preparation.6 In addition,\nwe’re seeing more and more productive collaborations between schools and employers to\nprovide small-town residents with in-demand skills, which I’m looking forward to hearing more\nabout in our first panel. These partnerships are good for employers, who need skilled workers.\nThey’re good for students, who get a direct entrée to a quality job. The school plays a critical\nconnector role.\n\nI’ve also seen community colleges play a critical role in fostering a startup ecosystem, bringing\naccess to coaching and connection to investors for prospective entrepreneurs and, thereby,\ngrowing critical jobs for communities that struggle to recruit them. I was recently in West\nVirginia, for example, where the Eastern West Virginia Community and Technical College\noperates the NewBiz Launch Pad accelerator program and the Institute for Rural\nEntrepreneurship and Economic Development, which supports new businesses in agriculture,\nmanufacturing, arts, tourism and technology.\n\nBut funding is a major challenge for community colleges. Certificate programs offer the most\ndirect path to employment, but students can’t use federal financial aid to pay for them. Often\nstate scholarship programs can’t be used for them either. State funding formulas are complex,\nand community colleges generally don’t receive as much state money for students enrolled in\nnoncredit programs. So I’m excited about programs like Fast Forward in Virginia, which funds\n\n-4-\n\n\fshort-term training through the state’s community colleges, and West Virginia Invests, which\ncovers tuition and fees for students seeking certificates in high-demand fields.\n\nMany community college students also face obstacles such as inadequate academic preparation\nor the need for child care or transportation. Successful initiatives help students address these\nchallenges. That’s the goal of programs like Tennessee Promise and Tennessee Reconnect,\nwhich provide students with mentors and “navigators” to help them stay on track.\n\nTheme 3: Isolation\nThird, let me discuss isolation. While it’s almost definitional, any effort to help those outside our\nlargest cities needs to address a core challenge: social and geographic remoteness.\n\nI don’t mean to imply that there aren’t strong social networks in place. On the contrary. Smalltown residents often report feeling stronger ties to their community and their neighbors than\npeople in other areas. That’s why it’s not helpful for a policymaker like me to say, “Everyone\nshould just move to the big cities where the jobs are.”\n\nWe need to address the informational gaps that often exist. For example, family, friends,\nneighbors and co-workers play a fundamental role in people’s aspirations and decisions about\neducation and work.7 So if you live in an area where fewer adults have attended college, you\nmight be less likely to view college as an option for yourself. Or, if you live in a more remote\narea, college reps might not come visit your high school. This is borne out by the data. Even\n\n-5-\n\n\fcontrolling for academic preparation and income, research has found that rural students are less\nlikely to apply to high-resource colleges.8\n\nThe disappearance of anchor institutions such as banks, hospitals and colleges is part of the\nchallenge. The number of rural counties with fewer than two bank branches per 10,000 residents\nin the Fifth District roughly doubled between 2012 and 2017. Eleven rural hospitals in our\nDistrict have closed since 2010 and another 21 hospitals—nearly 20 percent of those in our\nDistrict—are at high financial risk. Many rural colleges also face serious financial struggles. Ten\nin our District have closed their doors since 2000.9 The loss of these institutions creates direct\ncosts in terms of residents’ access to financial services, health care and education. But there are\nalso large indirect costs. Anchor institutions provide civic leaders and high-skilled workers who\ncan raise the aspirations of those around them. They invest in their communities and educate\nresidents about health, careers or finances. They supply amenities that attract talent. They create\nincentives for other businesses and signal a community’s vibrancy.\n\nI’m intrigued by initiatives that work to “thicken” these “thin” markets. The College Advising\nCorps, for example, based in Chapel Hill, places advisers in high schools to provide personalized\ncollege guidance to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In addition to helping students\nnavigate the application and enrollment process, advisers also help students and their families to\nsee college as an option in the first place.\n\nI’m also interested in initiatives that bring the community to isolated families in ways that\nbroaden their perspectives and improve their fortunes. I recently visited Garrett County,\n\n-6-\n\n\fMaryland, where they operate a 2-Generation model that works with both parents and children.\nThey help each family define a tailored pathway, simplify full access to available funding and\nprovide critical wraparound services like transportation and financial coaching. They support\nparents pursuing employment or training efforts in ways that help children receive high-quality\nearly education.\n\nCoaching has also been critical to the success of Taylor County, West Virginia, where over the\npast five years more than 220 new businesses have opened—in a county of fewer than 17,000\npeople. The town of Grafton, in the county, is participating in the Energizing Entrepreneurial\nCommunities Program, which pairs coaches with local entrepreneurs.\n\nMore broadly, the most compelling way to reduce isolation is to invest in infrastructure.\nHistorically, that was highways; today, it’s broadband. It’s expensive to build new infrastructure\nin areas with low population density and challenging terrain, as the members of our second panel\nwill discuss. But even if broadband is available, not every household can afford it. That’s evident\nhere in Virginia, where just 49 percent of households making less than $20,000 per year have a\nbroadband subscription, compared with more than 93 percent of households making at least\n$75,000 per year.10 But, like rural electrification 80 years ago, the benefits—in terms of\nopportunity identification, skill building, telemedicine and the like—are too big to pass up.\n\nTheme 4: Participation\nFinally, I want to discuss two impediments to labor force participation: disability and addiction.\n\n-7-\n\n\fIn the Fifth District’s smaller towns, 6.7 percent of the residents between the ages of 16 and 64\nreceive disability insurance, compared with 3.8 percent of residents in larger cities. This\ninsurance is a vital safety net for many of our citizens, but there is also some evidence that the\nstate of the overall economy influences disability rolls. I’m hopeful the gap will narrow if job\nprospects improve, and in fact there’s some evidence this is happening in the United States\noverall as the labor market tightens. More broadly, health in rural communities matters a lot, and\nwe support the large number of initiatives working to reduce chronic illness and thereby improve\njob attendance and productivity.\n\nOpioid addiction is a tragedy that knows no geographic or social boundaries, but it may be more\nconcentrated in rural areas. In the Fifth District, average opioid prescription rates are almost 30\npercent higher in smaller towns, and overdose death rates are higher as well. With respect to the\neffects on the labor market, it’s very hard to disentangle cause and effect, but some preliminary\nresearch suggests that the increase in opioid prescription rates between 1999 and 2015 could\naccount for 43 percent of the decline in prime-age men’s labor force participation.11 There’s no\neasy solution, but there are promising addiction-to-work programs, such as CARITAS Works in\nVirginia, which could help mitigate the effects.\n\nMaking Change Happen\nI’ve had the opportunity this year to travel the smaller communities in our District. I’ve been to\nHartsville and Bamberg, Greenville and Wilmington, Petersburg and Wise, Frederick and the\nEastern Shore, Beckley and Bluefield. In all of these communities, I’ve seen local leaders\n\n-8-\n\n\fpassionate about leading their towns forward. What seems to work? I might point to four\nimperatives:\n\n1. A good story. The story is for employers, and the story is for talent. But, importantly, the\nstory is less about marketing the plan to outsiders and more about marketing it to those who\nlive there—why one should come and why one should stay. A beautiful town square, an\nannual festival, attractive housing, a great school system and attractive amenities are often\npart of that story. But changing the prospects of a town, it seems to me, starts with aligning\nthe mindsets of the people in that town. And a great metric is whether the kids who grow up\nand go to school there choose to come back.\n\n2. Integrated leadership. The local leadership, of course, needs to be inclusive, but it also needs\nto be regional in its nature. Almost by definition, small towns are surrounded by other small\ntowns, and the strategy for that region needs to be integrated across jurisdictions. They need\nto speak with one voice and operate together, whether it’s on education, business recruitment\nor housing development. Similarly, a nearby bigger city isn’t a problem but a benefit—as\nproximity to amenities and transportation can enhance the story. The path to success isn’t\ngoing it alone; instead, it’s working together.\n\n3. Opportunistic funding. As we’ll hear about during and after lunch, funding is a challenge.\nBut—perhaps surprisingly—a lot of money goes toward smaller markets, often in a\npatchwork fashion. Making progress requires finding a source of committed funding,\nwhether it be federal or state agencies, local donors or foundations, local businesses, hotel\n\n-9-\n\n\ftaxes, tobacco settlement funds or asset sales. It also requires developing the capacity to\nabsorb that funding. The towns that seem to have the most momentum are the ones that seem\nto make the most out of their potential funding sources.\n\n4. Staying power. This kind of transformation takes time. Success breeds success, but it requires\npatience and persistence. Often, core institutions near the town, such as universities,\ncompanies or foundations, can help provide that continuity across political eras.\n\nI’ve encountered arguments that the challenges of distressed rural communities are too difficult\nto solve. They’re not. I’m old enough to remember when there was a similar pessimism about\nour major cities, which appeared during the 1970s and 1980s to be doomed to perpetual decline.\nThey weren’t.\n\nFrom my perspective, the first step in thinking about the problems of these areas is to approach\nthem as solvable—by good policymaking, by markets, by local leaders and by small-town\nresidents themselves.12 Thank you, and I’m looking forward to the conversations we’ll have\nthroughout the day.\n\n1\n\nVisit https://heckmanequation.org/ for an overview of research on early childhood education.\nDana Charles McCoy et al., “Impacts of Early Childhood Education on Medium- and Long-Term Educational\nOutcomes,” Educational Researcher, November 2017, vol. 46, no. 8, pp. 474-487.\n3\nSee Table 1 in Rasheed Malik, “The Effects of Universal Preschool in Washington, D.C.,” Center for American\nProgress, September 26, 2018.\n4\nThe Center for American Progress defines a child care desert as a ZIP code with at least 30 children younger than\n5 and either no child care centers or more than three times as many children as available spaces.\n5\nMaria Donovan Fitzpatrick, “Preschoolers Enrolled and Mothers at Work?

            "content": "Risk Management in Monetary Policy\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nRisk Management Association 2019 Economic Update\nRichmond, Virginia\nSeptember 26, 2019\n\nThank you very much for inviting me to speak with you this afternoon. I’d like to take a moment\nto share some thoughts on monetary policy, specifically how risk management principles inform\nour approach. Before I say more, I have to note that the views I express are my own and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.1\n\nI joined the Richmond Fed last January after a 30-year career in consulting at McKinsey,\nwhere—in addition to consulting—I had multiple roles including serving as our chief risk\nofficer.\n\nWe had a lot of risks to manage—the media, unhappy clients, cybersecurity defense, individual\nbehavioral issues and even crises such as an Ebola outbreak. So you might imagine that retiring\nand moving to public service has been a relief.\n\nBut the Fed has its own risks to contend with, and the stakes are high. We’re concerned about\ncybersecurity. We face operational risks when it comes to processing payments and\nimplementing monetary policy. We oversee risk in the financial system. Any of these topics\n\n-1-\n\n\fcould be a speech in themselves, but today I’d like to talk in more detail about one I hope you’ll\nfind interesting: risk management in monetary policy.\n\nEconomic Update\nLet’s start with a baseline look at the economy. Overall, if you look at the data, things are good.\nGDP has been pretty solid, averaging 2.7 percent over the past two years. The labor market is\nvery strong, with unemployment at 50-year lows. Although the pace of job creation has slowed\nsome, we’re still averaging around 160,000 new jobs per month since the beginning of the year,\nwell above the pace necessary to accommodate growth in the workforce. Bolstered by the strong\nlabor market, consumers are confident and are spending.\n\nWe are facing several headwinds, however. There is a great deal of uncertainty around trade and\npolitics, which matters for business confidence. Confidence is critical for businesses to want to\ninvest and for markets to be willing to finance that investment. So I’m particularly concerned\nabout the roller coaster we’ve been on recently. Between Brexit, the ongoing negotiations with\nChina, tensions in the Middle East and the political headlines—to name just a few—it’s been\ntough for businesses to feel like they’re on solid ground. That might be why business investment\nshrank 0.6 percent in the second quarter. I watch that number closely because eventually lower\ninvestment affects jobs.\n\nThe headwinds are having an impact overseas as well; GDP growth has slowed in China and\nstalled in the eurozone. In the second quarter, growth was negative in Germany, Europe’s largest\neconomy. There’s a risk that weakness will affect us.\n\n-2-\n\n\fAt just 1.6 percent over the past 12 months, inflation has been running persistently below the\nFOMC’s 2 percent target.2 We’re not that far away—if we just rounded, we’d be at target—but\nit’s also possible that the uncertainty I’ve discussed is limiting firms’ ability and willingness to\nraise prices.\n\nAnd the bond market has sent some concerning signals recently. The yield on 10-year treasuries\nhas been very low given the overall strength of the economy and has actually been lower at times\nthan the yield on 2-year treasuries. As you probably know, such an inversion of the yield curve is\nhistorically a good predictor of a recession. But is that what the yield curve is signaling now, or\nare we just seeing a move toward higher-yielding safe assets at a time when international rates\nare historically low?\n\nMonetary Policy Response\nOverall, I think it’s safe to say the economy is giving us conflicting signals. The strength of the\nlabor market might be saying “hold” or even “raise rates,” while inflation and the bond market\nmight be saying “lower rates.” How should policymakers think about it?\n\nIn 2018, the risk seemed to be the economy “overheating.” With interest rates well below\n“normal” levels, strong GDP growth, fiscal stimulus and a tight labor market, we raised the\ntarget rate four times, with many FOMC participants projecting additional rate increases the\nfollowing year.\n\n-3-\n\n\fBut in early 2019, political and global turmoil signaled more risk to the downside, so the\ncommittee decided to pause and take a patient approach, with a much flatter projected rate path.\n\nThen, over the last two meetings, with inflation muted, continued uncertainty and international\nweakness, we took the target rate down 50 basis points. This doesn’t mean a recession is\nimminent, nor that we are in a prolonged period of easing. As Chair Powell said after last week’s\nmeeting, the change was intended “to provide insurance against ongoing risks.” There is a lot of\nuncertainty about the outlook, particularly with respect to global growth and the impact of trade,\nso it seemed prudent to take out some insurance—which I’m sure a room full of risk managers\ncan appreciate.\n\nThe Risk Management Problem\nWe have a difficult risk management situation. We have a dual mandate, which means that right\nnow we are trying to close the gap on our inflation target while avoiding policy that’s too\naccommodative, pushing inflation too high or causing financial instability. And we battle\nconstant uncertainty. The dynamics of the economy are complex and constantly evolving, and\nthe information we get about those dynamics comes with a lag and are often revised. Add the\nfact that monetary policy can take a while to have an effect on the economy, and you see the\nchallenge.\n\nFurther complicating matters, we face risks in multiple directions.\n\n-4-\n\n\fEasing isn’t risk free. It’s tricky to stimulate the economy to a precise level, and we run the risk\nof overshooting our objective, as one could argue we did in the late 1960s.\n\nEven if lowering interest rates doesn’t end up overstimulating inflation, it could affect other\nareas of the economy.3 For example, it’s possible for low interest rates to distort markets by\nshifting resources into the most interest-sensitive sectors or encouraging firms to over-substitute\ncapital for labor. Or low interest rates could fuel an asset price bubble, as some have suggested\nhappened last decade.\n\nBut there are risks to not easing. We undermine the credibility of our 2 percent inflation target,\nwhich could lead to a decline in inflation expectations and thus to even lower inflation.4 In\naddition, if economic activity does slow further, we could find ourselves behind the curve,\nwishing we had moved more and sooner. This is especially relevant given how close we are to\nthe effective lower bound.5\n\nIn addition to the risk of missing on the upside or downside, we also have a trade-off between\nshort and longer term. Any rate move can be seen as facilitating a choice between consuming or\ninvesting today or tomorrow. At lower rates, you might accelerate a car or house purchase; at\nhigher rates, you might defer.\n\nSo we also face the question, should we move quickly in order to have more impact? Or does\nthat waste vital ammunition we might need for the next downturn? Economist William Brainard\n\n-5-\n\n\ffamously said that when uncertainty is high, proceed with caution—but sometimes caution is a\nrisk in and of itself.\n\nManaging the Risks\nHow do we manage these risks? Five themes: First, we try hard to specify a clear risk strategy.\nWe release each January a “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”\nThis statement articulates a balanced approach to our dual mandate and gives the public a sense\nof our risk appetite. We also communicate our reaction function through speeches, press\nconferences and other media so that markets understand what we’re doing and work alongside\nus.\n\nSecond, our governance and culture help us. We operate by committee, which gives voice to a\nrange of views, and the presence of regional Reserve Banks, with regional perspectives, helps us\navoid “group think.”\n\nWe are data-focused and invest in having the best analysis possible so we can make decisions\nwith confidence. There are around 350 economists on staff at the Board of Governors, and each\nregional Bank has a team of economists as well. To test and supplement the data, each Bank also\nmaintains very strong external networks, so we are constantly out talking to businesses to gauge\ntheir sentiment and gain a real-time perspective on the economy. We also have a number of\nsurveys to develop a richer understanding of trends in our District.\n\n-6-\n\n\fThird, we have a deep commitment to risk modeling. Every Tealbook, which FOMC participants\nreceive before each meeting, details a range of scenarios for how the economy could evolve and\nfully tests the potential upsides and downsides of possible policy changes. We also conduct a\nsimilar risk assessment of our financial system on a quarterly basis; key elements of which we’ve\nrecently started publishing twice a year as a Financial Stability Report.\n\nFourth, we constantly review and revise what we do in order to evolve along with the economy.\nThat is helped by the constant attention we get from the entire macroeconomics profession, the\nmedia and the markets. We get a lot of help! That said, we listen and we change. For example, in\nan effort to tame inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Fed began targeting monetary\naggregates (the quantity of money). When financial innovations made monetary aggregates a less\nuseful gauge of the state of the economy, the Fed shifted its attention away from them and now\ntargets the federal funds rate (the price of money). More recently, we have been using the interest\nrate paid on excess reserves to influence the federal funds rate rather than the traditional tool of\nopen market operations. In the last downturn, we introduced more specific forward guidance, an\nexplicit inflation target and quantitative easing.\n\nFinally, we push outside our borders to enable an environment less susceptible to risk. When we\nanchor inflation expectations, we reduce the chance that a few volatile inflation readings will\nhave an adverse effect. When we properly supervise the banking system, we reduce the risk of\nfinancial market distress. And there’s some history of Fed chairs (like Alan Greenspan) calling\nout deficits or “irrational exuberance.” I do worry now about the impact of today’s large federal\nbudget deficits on our resiliency in the next downturn.\n\n-7-\n\n\fAll that said, we’ve made mistakes. Modern scholars generally attribute the severity of the Great\nDepression to errors in monetary policy, and we accept much of the blame for the Great Inflation\nof the late 1960s and 1970s as well. But I hope you believe we’ve learned from those mistakes.\nThe lessons of the Great Depression guided the Fed’s response to the financial crisis. The Great\nInflation taught us the importance of maintaining the credibility of the Fed’s commitment to\nprice stability.\n\nCurrently, in the spirit of continuous improvement, the Fed is reviewing its monetary policy\nstrategy, tools and communication practices to ensure that we can continue to achieve our dual\nmandate given low inflation and the risk of returning to the effective lower bound. As part of that\nreview, we’ve been holding a series of “Fed Listens” events to get input from business leaders,\ncommunity members, academics and other stakeholders. We’re talking about a range of\napproaches, and the insights we’ve gained from these discussions have been invaluable. Now, in\nthe spirit of continuous learning, I’m looking forward to learning from you.\n\n1\n\nThank you to Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nBased on core PCE inflation.\n3\nFor example, see Esther George, “Is Low Inflation a Problem for the United States?” Speech at the Economic Club\nof Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn., May 14, 2019.\n4\nFor example, see James Bullard, “President Bullard Explains His Recent FOMC Dissent,” June 21, 2019.\n5\nFor example, see John Williams, “Living Life Near the ZLB,” Speech at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Central\nBank Research Association, New York City, July 18, 2019.\n2\n\n-8-\n\n\f",

            "content": "Fostering Entrepreneurship\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nWest Virginia Chamber of Commerce\n2019 Annual Meeting and Business Summit\nWhite Sulphur Springs, West Virginia\nAugust 28, 2019\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you today, and thank you for the kind introduction. It’s an\nhonor to be here with so many leaders from throughout West Virginia.\n\nSince joining the Richmond Fed last year, I’ve made it a priority to travel our District, which\nspans from Maryland to the Carolinas and includes most of West Virginia. I’ve seen small towns\nthat represent the best of what our country has to offer. But I’ve also seen many communities\nthat have lost ground. They deserve our attention, and I think the Richmond Fed has a real\nopportunity—and responsibility—to improve our understanding of the challenges they face and\nto search for ways to make a difference. To that end, we’ve spent the past year talking to\nbusiness leaders, educators, community leaders and residents to learn what it will take to move\nthe needle in smaller communities. Today, I’ll share some of what we’ve learned, in particular\nabout the potential to foster entrepreneurship.\n\nBefore I say more, I have to note that the views I express are my own and do not reflect the\nviews of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal\nReserve System.1\n\n-1-\n\n\fMoving the Needle\nLet me start with a few words about the economy. If you look at the data, the national economy\nappears great. Unemployment is at 50-year lows, GDP growth is solid and consumers feel\nconfident and are spending. International economies are weaker, though, and uncertainty—\nparticularly around trade—is elevated. Business investment dropped in the second quarter. In\nthat context, and with the risk of inflation muted, the FOMC decided earlier this month to make a\nmid-cycle reduction in interest rates, with the goal of providing a little insurance for the\ncontinued growth of the economy and strength of the labor market. We are monitoring its\nimpact.\n\nIn West Virginia, I’ve been pleased to see recent growth. Employment growth started to\naccelerate at the beginning of 2018, although this growth has not been evenly distributed across\ncounties. During the first quarter of 2019, personal income grew 5.6 percent, the fastest rate in\nthe country. Some of this growth is due to temporary jobs, such as those in pipeline construction,\nbut some is due to employers such as Toyota and Hino expanding recently.\n\nAt the same time, we all know West Virginia faces a number of challenges. The unemployment\nrate is elevated relative to the rest of the country—at 4.7 percent, it’s a full percentage point\nhigher than the national rate. The employment-to-population ratio, which accounts for both\nunemployment and labor force participation, is the lowest in the country at 51 percent. And we\nare all too familiar with the ravages of the opioid epidemic.\n\n-2-\n\n\fWhat can be done to help West Virginia address these challenges and build on its recent growth?\nWe believe there are four themes that matter if you want to move the needle.\n\nThe first is education, or more broadly, preparing people to enter the workforce. In the United\nStates, 35 percent of urban residents between the ages of 25 and 64 have a four-year degree,\ncompared with 22 percent of people in smaller towns. The rate is 21 percent across all of West\nVirginia. All else equal, the Richmond Fed has estimated that if educational attainment in small\ntowns equaled that of bigger cities, the employment-to-population gap in our District would\nshrink by 40 percent.\n\nOf course, we can’t just send more kids to college, because roughly 40 percent of those who\nenroll don’t graduate.2 Also, a four-year college isn’t the right fit for everyone, and there are\nwell-paying jobs that don’t require a degree. So we’re intrigued by the growing number of\nbusiness partnerships with high schools and community colleges that allow students to choose\nthe path that’s best for them. And I’m encouraged by growing state support for community\ncolleges, such as the new West Virginia Invests program. We also have to focus on preparing\nstudents for college and the workplace. That begins even before kids enter kindergarten, with\nhigh-quality early childhood education. I know West Virginia has invested in that.\n\nSecond, we’re looking at addressing the effects of geographic isolation. By this, I don’t mean\nthat there aren’t strong social networks in small towns—the opposite is often true. But there may\nbe informational and institutional gaps that don’t exist in larger cities. For example, it might be\n\n-3-\n\n\fmore difficult to learn about training opportunities in other places. Or if you live in a town where\nfewer adults have gone to college, you might not view college as a viable option for yourself.\n\nOne major issue is the loss of “anchor institutions,” such as hospitals and schools. Almost a\ndozen hospitals have closed across the Fifth District since 2010.3 Here in West Virginia,\nhundreds of schools have closed their doors since the early 1990s. These institutions provide\ncivic leaders and highly educated workers who can raise the aspirations of those around them.\nThey invest in their communities. They supply amenities that attract talent. They signal a\ncommunity’s vibrancy to potential business owners and residents. So when one closes, much\nmore than jobs are lost.\n\nThird, we’re studying barriers to participation, such as addiction and disability. I mentioned the\nopioid epidemic a few minutes ago. In the Fifth District, average opioid prescription rates are\nalmost 30 percent higher in smaller towns versus bigger cities, and overdose death rates are\nhigher as well. There’s no easy solution, but there are promising addiction-to-work programs that\nhelp mitigate the effects of addiction. Similarly, we’re studying disability-to-work incentives.\nThis insurance is a vital safety net for many people, but rural residents are more likely to receive\ndisability insurance than urban residents and the rates increased significantly during the last\ndownturn.\n\nFinally, we’re looking at connection, by which I mean facilitating workers’ access to good jobs.\nThis will be my focus today because, at the end of the day, people need places to work. Today’s\ntight labor market presents a great chance to connect more people to jobs, including people who\n\n-4-\n\n\fmight have had difficulty finding employment in the past. But a more rural state like West\nVirginia faces some unique challenges when it comes to attracting large employers. So how do\nwe get more West Virginians off the sidelines of the labor force? I believe that supporting rural\nentrepreneurs—understanding the unique obstacles they face and working to remove those\nobstacles—may be a way to help rural communities get more in the game.\n\nEntrepreneurship and Economic Growth\nBefore I discuss what policymakers might do to encourage entrepreneurship, let me make the\ncase that entrepreneurship matters for growth. Entrepreneurs do more than just create jobs for\nthemselves. Evidence strongly suggests that increases in entrepreneurship boost not only the\nnumber of people who are self-employed, but also the number of people employed overall in a\nlocal market.4 Nationwide, small businesses account for more than 60 percent of net jobs created\neach year.5\n\nIt’s true that the most dramatic job growth comes from transformational, high-growth firms—the\ncompanies that eventually grow into a Microsoft or a Google.6 But researchers at the Atlanta Fed\nconcluded that a higher percentage of employment in small, locally owned businesses is\nassociated with higher employment overall, greater income growth and lower poverty rates. 7\n\nOf course, increasing entrepreneurship isn’t a silver bullet to creating economic prosperity. But it\nis an important piece of the puzzle, particularly in more isolated areas where attracting a large\noutside employer is a remote possibility and many working-age people are in need of work.\nThere are benefits beyond jobs as well. When a community grows its own economic\n\n-5-\n\n\fdevelopment, it puts residents in charge of strengthening and diversifying their own economy,\nthereby increasing economic resilience in the face of global economic forces.\n\nOver the past several decades, however, entrepreneurship has declined in the United States. The\nstartup rate—the share of incorporated firms that are less than a year old—fell from almost 14\npercent in the late 1970s to 8 percent in 2016. And the self-employment rate, including both\nincorporated and unincorporated businesses, has dropped from 12 percent of employment in the\nmid-1990s to just under 10 percent in 2015.\n\nWhat is behind this trend? Some point to demographic changes, such as a decline in the number\nof immigrants—who typically have higher rates of self-employment—or slowing population\ngrowth overall.8 It’s also possible that the fixed costs of starting a business, such as meeting an\narray of regulatory requirements or making the technology investment required to compete, have\nincreased over time.9 The dominance of big-box retailers or risk aversion in the wake of the\nGreat Recession are other factors that could be at play.\n\nThe decline has been widespread geographically, and West Virginia is no exception. Over the\npast 30 years, the startup rate in West Virginia has fallen more than in the country as a whole,\nand in 2014, it was nearly 3 percentage points below the national average. West Virginia has\nranked in the bottom 10 states for self-employment in 23 out of the last 25 years.10 And the state\nranks last for the average number of jobs created by startups in their first year, at just under three\nper 1,000 people.\n\n-6-\n\n\fAt the same time, I believe West Virginia has several things going for it that make it ripe to\npromote entrepreneurship. The cost of doing business here is relatively low. In addition, you\nalready have a foothold in several industries that are predicted to have large increases in selfemployment over the next few years, such as personal care services, construction and health care\nsupport. Construction in particular has shown very strong growth over the past year, although\nthat could slow since pipeline construction has stopped. Finally, you’ve got people on the\nsidelines and—counterintuitively, perhaps—that’s a leading indicator of entrepreneurial activity.\n\nFostering Entrepreneurship in West Virginia\nHow can we harness those strengths to create tangible change? What does it take to create an\nenvironment that supports aspiring business owners and helps their businesses thrive? We’ve had\na number of conversations with entrepreneurs and community development professionals\nthroughout the Fifth District and specifically in West Virginia. We’ve heard a lot is underway\nthat could be supported by three key themes. Entrepreneurs need a stronger infrastructure\nplatform, they need better access to capital and they need a richer community around them.\n\nInfrastructure\nLet’s start with infrastructure. For entrepreneurs and small businesses to succeed, they need to\neither get their goods and services to their customers or bring their customers to them.\nHistorically, and to some extent today, West Virginia’s geography has made transportation a\nchallenge. But the development of the highway system in Appalachia has boosted West\nVirginia’s access to markets and increased jobs in professional services, tourism, education and\nhealth services. And when a critical portion of the highway system connecting Northern Virginia\n\n-7-\n\n\fto West Virginia is completed, it’s forecasted to generate almost 2,000 new jobs. In addition, the\n2017 Roads to Prosperity amendment represents a massive commitment by West Virginians to\ndevelop the state’s highways. I’m hopeful these projects will enable growth.\n\nToday, of course, businesses don’t necessarily need a physical road to reach their customers: The\nhighway of the 21st century is broadband. With broadband, a small business can reach\nexponentially more customers and suppliers. They get access to information and expertise. With\nbroadband, you can run any kind of business anywhere.\n\nMeasurements of broadband access are notoriously inaccurate. So while we know there is a\ndigital divide, it’s hard to know just how big this divide is. Still, it seems clear that West Virginia\nis on the wrong side of it. From 2013-17, more than one-quarter of West Virginia households—a\nhigher percentage than in all neighboring states—had no internet subscription at all, broadband\nor otherwise. Here in Greenbrier County, nearly 30 percent of households have no internet\naccess.\n\nThe biggest barrier to broadband is cost. The issue is twofold. First, it’s expensive to build new\ninfrastructure in areas with low population density and challenging terrain, and the costs to\ninternet service providers may outweigh their returns. But even if broadband is available, not\nevery household can afford it. This is evident here in West Virginia, where less than half of all\nhouseholds making below $20,000 annually have a broadband subscription but 90 percent of\nhouseholds making at least $75,000 annually have one.\n\n-8-\n\n\fHow can we overcome the cost barrier? New funding has been made available in the past year\nand a half to communities in West Virginia.11 But these communities need accurate data on who\nis unserved or underserved, and they need connections to the resources that are available to help\nthem access this funding. The West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council is working to\nprovide accurate data and is helping communities connect to local and national resources.\n\nIn the meantime, communities have come up with some inventive ways to get internet access to\nthose who don’t have it or can’t afford it. The Kanawha County Public Library, for example, just\nrolled out a mobile hot spot device that can be checked out for two weeks. Essentially, anyone\nwho doesn’t have access to internet at home can take it with them.\n\nIt seems to me that closing the divide is an entrepreneurial exercise in itself. It’s going to take\nindividuals in West Virginia coming up with creative, local solutions to get broadband to people\nthrough public/private partnerships and local cooperatives. It’s going to take people starting\nbusinesses that get computers and technology to people who need them. And it’s going to\nrequire new ways to deliver digital skills training so that communities can fully realize the\npotential that broadband offers.12\n\nFinancing\nCapital is critical to entrepreneurs and small businesses—and it can be hard to come by in\nsmaller towns. A report by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that every\ncounty in West Virginia could be considered a small business lending “desert,” where only a\nvery small proportion of small businesses receive loans. Community development financial\n\n-9-\n\n\finstitutions, or CDFIs, can step in to bridge the gaps left by traditional banks, but there is\nrelatively little CDFI funding here. Between 2010 and 2016, less than 2 percent of CDFI funding\nin the Fifth District was in West Virginia. The good news is, there are groups looking to invest in\nthis state, including federal grant programs, venture capital firms and angel investor networks.\nFor example, West Virginia Forward has published an “entrepreneur’s toolkit” that includes 100\ndifferent ways entrepreneurs can find the capital they need to realize their goals. I believe that if\nwe have some initial successes, more investors will be drawn in. Success begets success.\n\nThe challenge, of course, is accessing this capital. Trying to sift through the myriad of financing\nsources, each with separate eligibility requirements and application processes, all while trying to\nstart a business, is a daunting task. I’m encouraged by programs like the West Virginia Hive in\nnearby Beckley, which provides one-on-one coaching to educate entrepreneurs about their\nfinancing options, among other things. And because entrepreneurs in West Virginia often can’t\nwalk down the street and bump into other entrepreneurs, as their urban counterparts can, the\nHive also routinely brings together new and future business owners from the area to trade stories\nand share ideas. This is just one of many programs in West Virginia working to support startups.\n\nEcosystem\nThis brings me to the third theme. If we want people to become successful entrepreneurs, we\nneed to provide them with a startup environment. That includes business and technical\nassistance, a startup-friendly culture and a quality workforce. It begins with exposure to\nsuccessful entrepreneurs. As I said at the beginning, family, friends, neighbors and coworkers\nplay a fundamental role in people’s aspirations and decisions about education and work. We\n\n-10-\n\n\fneed to promote role models so that a high school student sees entrepreneurs and thinks, “I can\ndo that. That could be me.” This exposure can include coaching, both formal and informal, like\nthat provided at the West Virginia Hive.\n\nEntrepreneurs also need technical assistance, which could include support in writing business\nplans, applying for patents, conducting market research or, as I’ve mentioned, applying for\nfunding. Incubators and community college programs often serve as the connective tissue in\ncommunities that don’t have a high concentration of entrepreneurs. For example, Eastern West\nVirginia Community and Technical College operates the NewBiz Launch Pad accelerator\nprogram and the Institute for Rural Entrepreneurship and Economic Development, which\nsupports new businesses in agriculture, manufacturing, arts, tourism and technology.\n\nIt’s also important to foster regional collaboration so that such efforts can scale. I recently visited\na region in the Fifth District where economic development efforts have stalled because\nneighboring cities view them as a zero-sum game. That’s not the way to build a thriving region.\n\nFinally, a skilled workforce is critical. You need people who have the skills to create and run a\nbusiness, and they need people to hire. Here in West Virginia, the low employment-to-population\nratio implies that there is no shortage of people available to work. But it’s also the case that\nmany of these individuals face the obstacles to employment I discussed at the outset, such as\naddiction, disability or low educational attainment. Tackling these interrelated obstacles is easier\nsaid than done and will require innovation and cooperation among employers, schools, health\ncare providers and policymakers. But there’s great experimentation going on—for example, I\n\n-11-\n\n\frecently learned of an employer who offers addiction treatment to job applicants who fail their\ndrug tests.\n\nWhere It’s Working\nNothing I’ve described so far is simple. But it can be done, and we’ve seen it done in Taylor\nCounty, roughly 40 miles south of Morgantown. Unemployment and poverty are both lower in\nTaylor County than in West Virginia or Appalachia as a whole and are trending down. And it’s\nnot because they lured some big employer away from a neighboring town or state: Nearly onethird of the job growth in Taylor County since the Great Recession is accounted for by selfemployment. Over the past five years, Taylor County has seen 27 percent growth in new\nbusinesses, the second-fastest growth in the state. That is 221 new businesses in a county of just\nunder 17,000 people.13\n\nThe county has some natural advantages. Proximity to Morgantown might provide easier access\nto the resources a college town provides; and it’s not too far east of Highway 79. Still, I think\nmuch of Taylor County’s success can be explained by the themes I’ve described today.\n\nIn 2014, the town of Grafton in Taylor County was one of the first communities to participate in\nTurn This Town Around, a one-year campaign intended to help West Virginians identify and\nresource projects that would make a big difference in their communities—from cleaning\nstorefronts, to building walking trails, to creating a community garden. After that program ended,\nGrafton launched its own group, All Aboard Grafton, to maintain the momentum. The\nconnection to entrepreneurship might not be immediately obvious, but these initiatives created a\n\n-12-\n\n\flocal network of committed residents who met weekly to share ideas, make plans and\nreinvigorate their community. That created an environment where people were striving for more\nand were more able and willing to take risks. As I said, success begets success—it doesn’t matter\nif the first success is clean windows.\n\nThree years after “Turn This Town Around,” Grafton was selected to participate in the\nEnergizing Entrepreneurial Communities Program (E-Communities). This is a three-year\nprogram designed to encourage entrepreneurs and businesses. A critical part of this program is\nthat the community is paired with a coach who, among other things, talks with local\nentrepreneurs to find out what the community needs and connects the community to resources,\nincluding funding sources and peers and experts across the state.\n\nStories like that of Taylor County make me hopeful. Communities have within themselves the\nability to grow. All they need is a little support.

            "content": "Confidence, Expectations and Implications for Monetary Policy\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nGlobal Interdependence Center’s Rocky Mountain Economic Summit\nVictor, Idaho\nJuly 11, 2019\nGood morning. Thank you very much for inviting me to speak with you today. I’d like to start by\ntelling you a little bit about my background and my perspective. Then I’ll share some thoughts\non the economy and the Federal Reserve’s progress on meeting our dual mandate objectives. I’ll\nclose with some comments on the implications for monetary policy. Before I say more, I have to\nnote that the views I express are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nI joined the Richmond Fed last January after a 30-year career in consulting at McKinsey, where I\nhad roles including chief financial officer and leading our offices in the South. I’ve spent my\nprofessional life helping firms make decisions about hiring, compensation and prices, and I’ve\nmade a lot of those decisions myself. So I hope I’m bringing a different perspective to the\nFOMC. My colleagues on the committee are some of the most talented macroeconomists,\nbankers, academics and financial regulators in the country. But as the only committee member\ncoming from management, I approach things differently.\n\nConsumer and Business Confidence\nOne thing I’ve learned, both from my experience in business and from my time at the Fed, is that\nconfidence matters. As a consultant (and as a CFO myself), I saw clearly that confidence was\ncritical for businesses to want to invest and for markets to be willing to finance that investment.\nNow, I hear the same thing as I meet with business leaders throughout my District.\nIt’s true on the consumer side as well. Common sense suggests—and economists have shown—\nthat confidence is also essential for consumers to spend on big-ticket items. A sudden pullback in\ntheir expectations could easily affect consumer spending.\n1\n\n\fI also believe that today confidence is both more important and more volatile than it used to be.\nBoth good and bad news diffuse significantly more quickly and broadly. We surf the news on\nour phones 10 times (or more!) per day, and the business media is everywhere, even on planes.\nBut more news doesn’t necessarily equate to more confidence.\n\nRelative to a few decades ago, consumers are more exposed and therefore more sensitive.\nThey’re more directly invested in the stock market, particularly in index funds that move with\nthe market rather than with company fundamentals. Many households might also still be scarred\nfrom the Great Recession; overall, they are saving at rates twice what they did in 2007.\n\nIn addition, the business reaction function has gotten faster. Short-termism has increased as\nactivism in the market for corporate control has shifted companies’ focus. Just as with\nconsumers, I think firms’ resilience is down. They start with lower confidence—another\n“hangover” from the Great Recession. At the same time, businesspeople tell me the length of the\ncurrent upturn makes them nervous that another recession might be right around the corner.\n\nThe speed of the reaction function may be exacerbated by higher leverage. Corporate debt as a\npercentage of GDP is at an all-time high. Levered companies—and their creditors—have a bias\ntoward taking action on negative news. This can mean cutting costs, reducing staff or pricing for\nvolume.\n\nTaken together, all these factors lead to an asymmetry in which firms are much more cautious\nabout the downside than they are optimistic about the upside.\n\nPerhaps both consumers and businesses have a higher bar for spending decisions. It’s possible\nthat some of the tepid recovery from the Great Recession was a self-fulfilling lack of belief in the\nstrength of the economy. Firms’ fear of failure could have prevented them from making\ninvestments even in the presence of reasonable returns.\n\n-2-\n\n\fThis negative tilt, or asymmetry, continues today. Firms are frustrated with political polarization\nand uncertainty about trade and regulation. This limits their pricing courage and caps the upside\non their spending and investment decisions.\n\nFor these reasons, a drop in confidence could lead to lower investment, lower output and\neventually lower employment. If employment is placed at risk, consumption won’t be far behind.\nAnd that would place us in more serious difficulty. Put another way, I don’t discount the idea\nthat we could talk ourselves into a recession.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nIn fact, I think the economy is struggling with confidence today.\n\n2018 was great. The unemployment rate reached historic lows, the economy added an average of\nmore than 220,000 jobs a month, inflation ran for a time at our 2 percent target and GDP growth\nwas stronger than it has been in years. But as we entered 2019, I started to hear a lot of concern.\nThe times were good, but the mood was bad.\n\nThere were certainly a number of things to be uncertain about, including trade tensions, a\nslowdown in China, Brexit and market volatility, to name just a few. And especially in the\nUnited States: politics. The federal government shutdown hit confidence hard, and I believe this\nimpacted the numbers at the beginning of the year.\n\nBut the shutdown ended. Brexit was delayed. Trade deals looked to be settling. International\neconomies seemed on the mend. Markets bounced back. Perhaps the FOMC’s shift to a patient\nstance helped. Accordingly, we saw consumer confidence indices bounce back and that showed\nup in the consumption data. Consumers still feel confident, have jobs and are willing to spend.\n\nBut the roller coaster for business confidence continues. Trade tensions have escalated again, and\nthreats of Mexico tariffs hit business confidence hard—how can you manage your supply chain\nwhen you don’t know what its cost will be? Mexico may have seen a reprieve most recently, but\n-3-\n\n\funcertainty remains around trade talks with the European Union, Japan and, of course, China.\nAnd, if tariffs are indeed a tool for a variety of objectives, we will be in a persistently more\nuncertain place.\n\nMore broadly, Brexit is back, with the potential to be even messier than we were anticipating.\nInternational economies are weakening again. The federal debt ceiling hasn’t been lifted. And,\neven more than a year out from the next presidential election, I hear business leaders getting\nnervous about the political noise. All these anxieties have the potential to build.\nAll told, business confidence is fragile, uncertainty is increasing and I’m increasingly concerned\nabout both. If they deteriorate further, that could affect growth, investment, pricing and\nemployment.\n\nInflation\n\nIn the presence of fragile confidence, what can a central bank do? We can aim to deliver on our\nmandates for maximum employment and price stability, which in turn create an environment\nstable for businesses and stable for consumers. In such an environment, few consumers face the\nrisks of job loss and disruption. Low and steady inflation makes tomorrow’s prices uninteresting,\nso that business as usual can continue today.\nAt present, I think it’s safe to say we are doing well on our employment mandate. Of course,\nthere are still people who want to work who can’t find a job and troubling disparities across\nracial, ethnic and regional lines—but overall, the labor market is historically strong.\n\nWith respect to price stability, core PCE inflation has been running persistently below our\n2 percent target. To be frank, I’m torn as to how large a concern this presents. On one hand,\nsome of the current low inflation is due to transitory factors, such as changes in the methodology\nfor calculating apparel prices. Part is also due to the first quarter “confidence shock” I discussed,\nwhich likely limited firms’ pricing courage.\n\n-4-\n\n\fOn the other hand, running systemically below the target feels like a problem that should be\naddressed. But, if you will give me a third hand, if we just reported with no decimals, we would\nbe at target and would have been in most years.\nYou might say we’re a victim of our own high standards. I’m old enough to remember the 1970s\nand 1980s and the painful lengths the Fed went to in order to tame inflation. Running within a\nfew tenths of a point of target would have seemed unimaginable to the Fed leaders at that time.\nLooking at the big picture, inflation has been, and continues to be, low and steady and not the\nconcern of businesses nor consumers—and that is the real goal.\n\nLet me turn now to some of the factors that determine inflation. The standard economic theory is\nclear enough about the short run: Interest rate moves affect the real economy, with some lag. In\nturn, these changes in the real economy affect inflation through the Phillips curve. As firms pay\nmore for labor, they raise prices accordingly. Over the longer run, credible monetary authorities\nset and build a track record of delivering against inflation expectations, which become a\nbenchmark for businesses and consumers.\n\nI was in business for 30 years. How do I think inflation works in practice?\n\nMost companies in most industries have settled pricing routines that are slow to change. These\nroutines begin with inflation expectations and are also grounded in what firms perceive about\ntheir competitors’ and customers’ reaction functions. Costs matter, of course, as the Phillips\ncurve implies, and are particularly important when they’re highly visible and industry-wide, as in\nthe case of steel tariffs or a spike in oil prices. But right now, the Phillips curve doesn’t look to\nbe having the effect on pricing one might expect. Part of that is perhaps because the labor share\nof content has declined in many industries, making labor costs less of a factor.\n\nI would also point to what firms perceive about their ability to raise prices for their customers.\nThis isn’t a big issue in many service businesses, like construction or a barber shop, where higher\nwages create a margin squeeze that more directly drives higher prices. But it’s worth taking a\nlook at consumer goods, particularly durable goods, where inflation has been basically\n-5-\n\n\fnonexistent for 25 years. Big-box stores have taken share by building their strategy around low\nprices, and they achieve that strategy by exerting significant pressure on their suppliers. Firms’\npurchasing departments have become increasingly sophisticated, leveraging global supply chains\nand private label alternatives. Internet transparency has made it easy for consumers to shop\naround and for new entrants to challenge established firms on price. And, as I’ve discussed, even\nwith inflation expectations well-grounded for the economy as a whole, lack of confidence can\naffect firms’ willingness to raise prices in their particular sector.\n\nBut corporate margins are up. How can this be happening when prices are being squeezed? Firms\nare investing significantly in efforts to capture more “effective” prices without raising list prices.\nReducing the thread count in a sweater, introducing new “premium” products, reducing\ndiscretionary terms or adding on extra fees have all been ways firms have been able to maintain\nor even increase their margins without raising prices. Our metrics reflect some, but not all, of\nthese practices.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nWhat are the implications of this for monetary policy?\nExpectations are deeply grounded in firms’ pricing routines. This became clear in 2009 during\nthe downturn when prices didn’t drop as much as one might have feared and again last year\nwhen they didn’t increase as much as expected, despite a strong economy. Expectations are very\nhard to shift. Recognize this as success, not failure.\n\nAs a result, short-term interest rates are a blunt instrument. I do believe they work over time but\nwith long lags and an imprecise impact. Small rate moves are unlikely to do much to move\nsettled routines. And large moves run the risk of targeting 2 percent but delivering 4 percent.\nWhat’s happening sector-by-sector in the real economy can help or hurt the transmission of any\nrate moves. Right now, with productivity up relative to the past few years, accommodation is not\nhaving its usual effect. The consumer sector factors I discussed earlier also dampen inflation\n-6-\n\n\ftoday, as do health care regulation, the decline in unionization and industries (like utilities) that\npassed tax cuts on to customers. There is some potential offset from tariffs; but retaliatory tariffs\nand resulting industry overcapacity could take pricing the other way. Net, today, these “real”\ndrivers may be having a much more significant impact than monetary ones.\nAs a result, humility is a monetary policy virtue. The data aren’t perfect, and inflation may well\nbe closer to target than one might think, as suggested by measures like the Dallas trimmed mean.\nIt strikes me as tricky to intervene in pursuit of an imprecise benefit; if one tries too hard to use\nlow rates to get reflation, you might end up, not for the first time, with excess leverage and\nfrothy valuations. And, with the Phillips curve so “flat,” there are likely especially long lags in\nthe effects of rate moves. The FOMC shifted its stance in January; it will take inflation some\ntime to react to the significant flattening signaled in the future rate path—even as we may\nexperience even lower unemployment.\nI want to help lower the volume. The more one says you’re short of target, the more you risk\nconvincing people that you won’t hit that target. Firms don’t move their expectations a tenth of a\npoint at a time, they move them in whole numbers. In that context, inflation expectations are\npretty stable. I hope to help keep them that way by not messaging a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nFinally, we all have to avoid complacency. The Fed has worked hard over the past three decades\nto keep inflation expectations anchored, but as future generations forget about the Great\nInflation, we have to remember that anchored expectations are not a right—they are earned. An\neconomy can run so hot for only so long before creating conditions you’ll regret.\n\nThe Fed held a recent conference on potential monetary policy frameworks. The perspectives\njust outlined inform my views. I support changes that acknowledge the imprecision of what the\nFOMC is trying to do, say by establishing a target range for inflation and looking at multiple\nmetrics, as Canada has done. But I’m wary of trying to do too much. I’m not yet convinced about\nstrategies (beyond zero lower bound forward guidance) that commit to taking actions in the\nfuture. Will those strategies really be understood and believed? Given settled routines and\nembedded expectations, will they have the desired impact? And if not, what will future\n-7-\n\n\fpolicymakers be signed up for? I note the research that suggests multiple equilibria given the\nzero lower bound2 and fear that moving too quickly while focused on inflation risks could, in\nturn, focus attention on inflation in ways that lower expectations, creating a low rate/low\ninflation scenario like that found in Europe and Japan.\nNow, the question you’re really waiting for me to answer—what does all this mean for the path\nof interest rates? In my view, with inflation muted, there isn’t much case for stepping on the\nbrakes. With unemployment so low and consumer spending so healthy, it’s equally hard to make\na case for stepping on the gas.\nAs I’ve discussed today, I don’t see the current levels of inflation or inflation expectations as a\ntrigger for additional accommodation. The potential to use rate changes to alter firms’ settled\nroutines is small, and the potential cost of overreaching, as I outlined earlier, feels real.\n\nThat said, I am tracking closely the environment for growth, which includes not only hard data,\nbut also the softer—and vital—information on consumer and business sentiment. If confidence\nfalters sharply, I would certainly make the case to my peers that we should pay attention to it and\ndo what we can to support continued economic expansion.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n1\n\nThank you to Kartik Athreya and Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nJess Benhabib, Stephanie Schmitt-Grohé, and Martín Uribe, “The Perils of Taylor Rules,” Journal of Economic\nTheory, January 2001, vol. 96, nos. 1-2, pp. 40-69.\n2\n\n-8-\n\n\fHighlights:\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nI believe our economy’s performance is driven in important ways by sentiment, that is, the\noutlook and beliefs of consumers and businesses. At present, I’m concerned about increasing\nuncertainty and fragile business confidence.\nIn the presence of fragile confidence, a central bank can aim to deliver on our mandates for\nmaximum employment and price stability in order to create a stable environment for businesses\nand consumers.\nAt present, we are doing well on our employment mandate. With respect to price stability, core\nPCE inflation has been running persistently below our 2 percent target. I’m torn as to how large a\nconcern this presents.\nMost companies in most industries have settled pricing routines that are slow to change.

At the same\ntime, I don’t see the current levels of inflation or inflation expectations as a trigger for additional\naccommodation. The potential to use rate changes to alter firms’ settled routines is small, and the\npotential cost of overreaching feels real. It’s also hard to make a case for stepping on the gas\nwith unemployment so low and consumer spending so healthy.\nThat said, I am tracking closely the environment for growth.

            "content": "Challenges to Women’s Labor Force Participation\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharlotte Economics Club\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nJune 3, 2019\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you very much for inviting me to join you today. I’d like to tell you a\nlittle bit about my background and my perspective, and then I’d like to share some thoughts on\ngrowing the economy. Before I say more, note that the views I express are my own and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System. 1\n\nI joined the Richmond Fed last January after a 30-year career in consulting at McKinsey, where I\nwas the chief financial officer and led the offices in the South. I’ve spent my professional life\nhelping firms make decisions about hiring, compensation and prices, and I’ve made a lot of those\ndecisions myself. So I’m trying to bring a different perspective to the FOMC. My colleagues on\nthe committee are some of the most talented macroeconomists, bankers, academics and financial\nregulators in the country. But as the only committee member coming from management, I can\napproach things as a practitioner rather than a researcher.\n\nAt the same time, I have greatly enjoyed the opportunity to dig into economics. In particular,\nI’ve been studying long-run economic growth. At some level, the math of growth is pretty\nsimple: We need more people working, and we need them to be more productive. In recent years,\nhowever, both population and productivity growth have been slow. I’m hopeful that productivity\ngrowth will improve, but in the meantime, it’s worth exploring how we can draw workers off the\n\n\fsidelines. We need that to happen — for the health of our economy, for our fiscal soundness and\nto lift the fortunes of those left behind.\n\nTrends in Women’s Labor Force Participation\nA lot has been written about the declining rate of male participation in the workforce, but I’d like\nto spend today focusing on the participation of women. In the United States, women’s labor\nforce participation increased steadily throughout the second half of the 20th century. But around\n2000, it leveled off and then began to decline. This is a divergence from other developed\ncountries. In the late 1990s, for example, the labor force participation rate for women aged 2554, whom I’ll refer to as prime-age women, was the same in the United States and Canada. Since\nthen, however, the rate has continued to increase in Canada while it has decreased here, leading\nto a 7.9 percentage point gap between the two countries in 2017. If the United States had the\nsame prime-age participation rate as Canada, an additional 5 million women would be in the\nlabor force. 2 That would be a significant boost to our potential growth.\n\nWhat is behind the gap in women’s participation? First, we need to calibrate in the context of\ndemographics. One difference we see in the United States is a much larger population of\nHispanic women, who traditionally have a lower labor force participation rate than non-Hispanic\nwomen, by around 9 points. 3 The share of the female labor force that is Hispanic has increased\nfrom 8.7 percent in 1997 to 16.4 percent in 2016, a trend that accounts for just under a point of\nthe participation gap. But note that this trend is changing. The participation rate for all prime-age\nwomen in the United States has increased since 2015, likely due to the strengthening economy,\nand some have found that Hispanic women accounted for almost two-thirds of the increase. 4\n\n-2-\n\n\fAnother demographic trend to consider is educational attainment. Higher levels of education are\nassociated with higher labor force participation, and in both countries, an increase in the number\nof women with a college education boosted their participation. But the increase was larger in\nCanada, where the share of prime-age women with a bachelor’s degree increased almost 17\npercentage points from 1997 to 2015. In the United States, the share increased 11.4 points.\nIncreasing levels of education accounted for an increase in participation of almost 4.5 points\nfrom 1997 to 2016 in Canada versus just under 2 points in the United States.\n\nFinally, let’s look at the effect of an aging population, which tends to lower participation rates. In\nthis case, the relative demographics actually helped the United States, although the overall effect\nwas fairly small. Between 1997 and 2016, an aging population cost Canada a quarter of a point;\nduring the same time period in the United States, the aging of the population had very little\neffect.\n\nIf you are following the math, we started with a 7.9 point gap, plus a quarter of a point due to an\naging population in Canada. Then, we subtract 2.5 points for education and around 1 point for\nthe Hispanic population. That leaves us with roughly 4.5 points unexplained by demographics.\n\n-3-\n\n\fChallenges Facing Less-Educated Women\nWhat’s behind the remaining gap? You might assume, as I did, that parental obligations drive the\ndifference, but the number of women not working for this reason has not significantly increased\nover this time period. Of course, participation does vary for women who have children, but the\ndecline in participation does not fall along those lines. Instead, the decline is most dramatic for\nprime-age women with less formal education — regardless of whether they have children or not.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2015, the U.S. participation rate for prime-age women of all education levels\ndropped almost 3 percentage points. But for prime-age women with a high school education or\nless, participation dropped 7.4 points. It fell even further — almost 9 points — for women aged\n25 to 44. Surprisingly, that is not the story in Canada. In Canada, the increase in women’s\nparticipation is driven primarily by women aged 45 to 54, who experienced an increase of almost\n10 points. Within that group, the gain was largest for women with less formal education, roughly\n8 points.\n\nSo what is going on with less-educated women that is driving down their participation in the\nworkforce in the United States yet driving it up in Canada? And more important, what can we do\nabout it? With this population, and this decision, I want to make the case that money matters. So\nlet’s look at the fundamental economic equation for these women.\n\nThe Economic Equation\nThe Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a great program that lifts millions of people out of\npoverty each year. 5 But its phase-out can create barriers to working. 6 Imagine a woman in her\n\n-4-\n\n\fmid-30s. She has two children and lives in northern Virginia, where she works at a day care\ncenter and is married to a construction worker. If they both work full time, they earn around\n$55,000 per year — at which point they no longer qualify for the EITC and stand to lose $3,700\nat tax time. 7 And because our system taxes the first dollar earned by the second earner at the\nsame rate as the last dollar earned by the primary earner, they are pushed into a higher tax\nbracket. Add to this the cost of child care and other work-related expenses, and the family’s\nmonthly take-home pay might be actually higher when the woman does not work or works\ninformally in the shadow economy.\n\nSimilarly, disability insurance is a vital safety net for many people. But there are aspects of our\ndisability insurance program, including the fact that you instantly forfeit life-long benefits if you\nengage in the workforce, that create disincentives to working. The number of prime-age women\nin the United States who received Social Security disability insurance benefits increased from\n1.2 million in 2000 to 1.9 million in 2014, increasing from 2.0 percent to 3.0 percent of women\nin this age group. 8\n\nLet’s imagine a single mother in her mid-40s, working as a retail cashier in Columbia, South\nCarolina. She struggles with a chronic illness that makes it difficult for her to work. Disability\ninsurance provides her with a lower gross income than working full time, but it lasts until\nretirement, comes with Medicare eligibility and doesn’t entail costs such as child care. If she\ntakes a full-time job, she has to assess the risk that — if that job goes away for any reason — she\nloses these benefits that bridge to retirement.\n\n-5-\n\n\fFinally, let’s imagine a married woman who works in a poultry processing plant in West\nVirginia. If she and her spouse both work, they earn an additional $600 a month, but there are a\nlot of nonfinancial incentives — what I’d call the “hassle factor” — that motivate not working or\nworking informally. If she works informally, for example, by babysitting for friends or family,\nshe has a more flexible schedule and her day-to-day environment may be more attractive.\n\nWhat Can Be Done?\nHow do we make it more likely that women like the ones I’ve described participate in the labor\nforce?\n\nEmployers play a big role. We hear a lot these days about companies struggling to find\nemployees. They can break down barriers to women’s participation by offering more stable\nschedules, better working conditions or on-site child care. For example, we know of a furniture\nmaker in West Virginia who’s been able to attract and retain a majority female labor force by\noffering a single shift, replacing educational requirements with apprentice-style training and\naiming to provide employees with a better lifestyle.\n\nAnd, while I mentioned earlier that the most dramatic decline in participation does not appear to\nbe among women with children, employers could also consider paid maternity leave and highquality affordable child care. Some research has found that over a quarter of the increase in\nwomen’s labor force participation in other OECD countries relative to the United States is due to\nthe expansion of these family-friendly policies. 9\n\n-6-\n\n\fPolicymakers can help. I’ve discussed policies that may discourage women from entering or\nstaying in the labor force, such as the joint tax system, the phase-out of the EITC or the structure\nof disability insurance. Fiscal policies are out of the Fed’s purview, and therefore I’m not taking\na stand on any particular policy nor suggesting the incentives have changed, but I do think that\nthe total incentive structure merits reexamination. Work has been done that shows that a\nCanadian tax reform that effectively reduced the tax rates of a second earner increased the labor\nsupply of married women. 10\n\nAnd finally, solutions can come from these women themselves. As I noted earlier, we know that\neducation increases women’s participation in the workforce. Workers with more education also\ntend to have higher earnings, greater wealth, more resiliency to downturns and better health. But\nbefore we turn this problem back to the workers, we have to remember that the same barriers that\nmake it hard for many women to be in the workforce make it hard to go back to school. In our\ndistrict, we’ve seen some innovative solutions to breaking down these barriers, such as the\nWorkforce Investment Network (WIN) Program in Charlotte, a collaboration between the\nCarolina Fintech Hub, community partners and employers. The WIN program targets women\nand minorities, provides technical training and soft-skill development and guarantees program\ngraduates a full-time position at participating financial services firms. Importantly, in addition to\npaying students during the training, the WIN program provides wraparound services, such as\ntransportation and child care assistance, that make it easier for students to complete the program.\n\n-7-\n\n\fConclusion\nTo sum up, women with less education in the United States face a number of obstacles to\nworking, which could be contributing to a decline in women’s labor force participation in the\nUnited States relative to other countries. As a policymaker, I’m concerned not only about the\nwell-being of these individuals, but also about our country’s long-term economic growth.\nEmployers, policymakers and workers can invest to remove these obstacles; doing so would\nbenefit them and our nation as a whole.\n\nThank you, and now I look forward to your reactions and questions.\n\n1\n\nThank you to Nina Mantilla and Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nThis figure is based on the prime-age participation rate in Canada in 2017.\n3\nRichmond Fed calculations based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

            "content": "The Effects of Market Concentration on Suppliers\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nMarket Structure and the Macroeconomy\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nRichmond, Virginia\nMay 16, 2019\nThank you all very much for joining us. The questions we’re here to explore are both very\nimportant and very complex, and I’m very grateful for the opportunity to learn from the best\nminds in the business.\n\nWith apologies to the Richmond Fed folks in the room, who’ve heard this before, I thought I’d\nstart by telling you a little bit about myself and my perspective. Before I say more, I have to note\nthat the views I express are my own and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nI joined the Richmond Fed last January, after a 30-year career in consulting at McKinsey where I\nhad roles including chief financial officer, chief risk officer and leading our offices in the\nSoutheast. I’ve spent my professional life helping firms make decisions about hiring,\ncompensation, prices – and, yes, M&A – and I’ve made a lot of those decisions myself. As the\nonly member of the FOMC coming from management, I can approach the issues your work\nsheds light on as a practitioner rather than a researcher.\n\nAnd that’s how I approach the topic of market concentration. I’ve certainly seen industries that\nhave consolidated and, as a consequence, fundamentally altered their competitive dynamics and\n\n\fthe resulting markups they capture. Airlines are a classic example. Once, they were the poster\nchild for destroying value. But about 10 years ago, the U.S. industry consolidated to four\ncarriers, and they leveraged international joint ventures to limit competition transoceanically. As\na result, they increased their ability to profit: They found it easier to introduce and sustain higher\nfares and new fee structures, and they increased their negotiating power vis-à-vis their unions.\nProfitability has improved dramatically.\n\nBut I have to say I am less confident that the same effect has been replicated across industries.\nModest increases in concentration have nowhere near the power I just outlined. Markets are\nincreasingly globally competitive or—as our Richmond team has outlined—locally competitive.\nThe inflation data we monitor suggests that, if anything, business are losing rather than gaining\npricing power.\n\nSo, why are we seeing markups increase?\n\nOne aspect of market concentration that strikes me as particularly important is the effect on\nsuppliers: In the cases I’ve been a part of, and in my experience more generally, when firms get\nlarge, they acquire more bargaining power—especially with respect to their suppliers. This might\nhelp to explain how increased market concentration could coexist with quite muted inflation,\nparticularly for consumer goods. It’s easiest to see in the retail sector. In 2017, the five largest\nretailers in the United States accounted for more than 35 percent of the 100 largest retailers’ total\nU.S. sales. I’ve seen directly the significantly greater pressure that these large stores are now able\nto exert on manufacturers with respect to pricing, delivery time and packaging, among other\n\n-2-\n\n\fvariables. Suppliers that don’t comply might be replaced or lose space on a store’s shelves. And,\nas trade barriers and the costs of transportation and information have declined, it has become\neasier for retailers to develop new suppliers, both domestic and foreign, to take the place of\nsuppliers who can’t meet their requirements. As these trends continue, and more downstream\nfirms are subject to this “new normal,” I suspect we will experience continued downward\npressure on an even broader range of relative prices. And these real factors could interact with\nmonetary policy in a way that leads to a longer period of relatively low inflation.\n\nThe shift toward “private label” goods also has affected retailers’ bargaining power. Long gone\nare the days of “generic” food sold in black and white cans. Today, large retailers have the scale\nto develop their own products, and they can distribute everything from gourmet chocolate to pet\nfood to clothing. By one estimate, the dollar share of private label goods will account for more\nthan 25 percent of U.S. sales within the next decade. Private label goods offer retailers higher\nprofit margins and a chance to increase their connection to consumers. But they also give\nretailers leverage over national brands; research has found that retailers earn much higher\nmargins on national brands in categories where they have a strong presence with a store brand.\n\nRetail isn’t the only sector where bargaining power relative to suppliers has increased. Beginning\nwith the auto industry, companies across sectors have invested significantly in the capabilities\nand sophistication of their purchasing departments. They have built talent in their organizations\nand set high aspirations for savings. Executives are now, far more than at earlier points in my\ncareer, incentivized to avoid price increases, so they look for creative ways to reconfigure their\noperations to reduce purchasing volume and capture margin dollars from suppliers. When these\n\n-3-\n\n\fefforts are successful, they paint a different picture of how market concentration might lead to\nhigher profits—a picture with far lower inflationary pressures.\n\nAnd, of course, this perspective is equally applicable to the biggest supplier—labor. We know\nlabor’s share of income has been decreasing over time. Part of that is perhaps the declining role\nand influence of labor unions. Part is no doubt the opening and leverage of low-cost global labor\npools. But part is also likely increased bargaining power by evermore concentrated employers\nwithin domestic markets.\n\nI’m struck, as I speak to employers and employees about today’s tight labor markets, by how\nhard it has been to see significant wage increases.\n\nEmployees aren’t changing jobs the way they did in the late ’90s; they often cite a “hangover”\nfrom the Great Recession that has made them feel less secure. Employers feel they have more\nability to withstand wage pressure than they have power to pass increases along.\n\nNet, I believe more-concentrated employers are leveraging their market power not to raise prices\nto consumers but to extract value from suppliers and from employees.\n\nUnderstanding how market power affects labor and suppliers, and in turn the economy more\nbroadly, is a topic I’m continuing to study and one I would love to get your thoughts on.\n\nNow, I welcome your reactions and questions.\n\n-4-\n\n\f-5-\n\n\f",

            "content": "Sentiment and the Real Economy\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nNew York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, New York\nMay 15, 2019\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you very much for inviting me to speak with you today. Your list of past\nspeakers reads like an economics hall of fame, but I hope I can add something interesting to the\nconversation. 1 I’d like to start by telling you a little bit about my background and my\nperspective, and then I’ll share some thoughts on the economy and monetary policy. In\nparticular, I’ll talk about the role of sentiment in consumer and firm behavior and some\nimplications for conducting monetary policy. Before I say more, I have to note that the views I\nexpress are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI joined the Richmond Fed last January after a 30-year career in consulting at McKinsey, where I\nhad roles including chief financial officer, chief risk officer and leading our offices in the\nSoutheast. I’ve spent my professional life helping firms make decisions about hiring,\ncompensation and prices, and I’ve made a lot of those decisions myself. So I hope to bring a\ndifferent perspective to the FOMC. My colleagues on the committee are some of the most\ntalented macroeconomists, bankers, academics and financial regulators in the country. But as the\nonly committee member coming from management, I can approach things as a practitioner rather\nthan a researcher.\n\n1\n\n\fThat said, I am tremendously grateful for the support of my research team at the Richmond Fed.\nThe insights I’ll share with you today stem from my experience in business, but they’ve been\nsharpened and refined through long conversations with our economists.\n\nThe Current Outlook\nAt the Fed, we often describe ourselves as data dependent. The data today tell us we had a very\nstrong 2018, with average GDP growth of 3 percent, unemployment below 4 percent and\ninflation basically right at our 2 percent target. Some numbers looked weaker at the beginning of\nthis year, but the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ advance estimate for first quarter GDP growth\nwas 3.2 percent. The labor market also remains strong with unemployment now down to\n3.6 percent. Most forecasters anticipate continued growth this year, as do I.\n\nTo be sure, inflation so far this year is running a little below our target. That might well be due to\ntransitory factors, as the chairman outlined in his recent press conference. In this context, it\nmakes sense to remain patient. There’s not a strong case to push rates higher when inflation is\nunder control; there’s not a strong case to move lower when growth remains healthy.\n\nOne reason I’m patient is I believe our economy had a short-term “sentiment shock” at the end of\nlast year and the beginning of this year. There was a significant drop in business, consumer and\ninvestor confidence fueled by—and overreacting to—international uncertainty, financial market\nvolatility and the government shutdown and its implications for our political health. These events\nall stoked fears about the real economy at a time when I believe the broader picture had not\nreally changed.\n\n-2-\n\n\fDefining Sentiment\nWhat do I mean by “sentiment”? As a practitioner and as a policymaker I’ve learned that the\neconomy can move in ways not fully justified by moves in fundamentals. Especially sensitive are\nvariables that depend on expectations about the future, such as spending on consumer durables,\ninvestment and, most famously, stock prices. This suggests that something else matters. I’m\ncalling that business and consumer sentiment.\n\nIn his seminal 1936 book The General Theory of Unemployment, John Maynard Keynes used the\nphrase “animal spirits” to describe the idea that beliefs and views not only matter for decisionmaking, but also change in ways that are hard to predict and manage. As a longtime business\npractitioner, I too think of sentiment in this way. I believe our economy’s performance is driven\nin important ways by the outlook and beliefs of consumers and businesses—over and above what\nthe hard data, and past patterns in it, by themselves would imply. In other words, having the\nincoming data is one thing, but knowing what consumers and companies think about the road\nahead is quite another.\n\nScholars have formalized the notion of sentiment in a variety of ways. Examples include the now\nlarge literatures on “news shocks,” “sunspot shocks,” “uncertainty shocks,” “sticky information,”\n“data misperceptions” and the like. 2 Clearly, the definition of sentiment is tricky. But what these\nnotions all have in common is the idea that businesses and consumers have to form views in\norder to operate successfully in an uncertain world, and that they may at times find it very\ndifficult to do so. This latter point is especially important in my view.\n\n-3-\n\n\fSentiment is not unrelated to “confidence.” Confidence is a must for businesses to want to invest\nand for credit and equity markets to be willing to finance that investment. As a practitioner, it’s\nnot surprising to me that the investment is significantly more volatile than GDP. Confidence is\nalso essential for consumers to spend, but, in our economy, most of what we produce is for\nimmediate consumption rather than investment. Spending for immediate consumption isn’t\ngreatly affected by confidence, but, because households bear substantial risks that they cannot\neasily insure, such as losing a job or falling ill, they are unlikely to spend on big ticket items\nwithout at least some assurance of future stability. As a result, a sudden pullback in their\nexpectations could easily affect their expenditures and tip the economy into recession.\n\nPractitioners and policymakers have both, at some general level, long recognized what I’ve\ndescribed. I view the many policy levers erected around us—the automatic stabilizers of\nunemployment insurance, safety net programs and deposit insurance, among others—as a\nresponse to the idea that fear and optimism should not contribute unduly to the volatility of our\neconomy. Nonetheless, no amount of publicly funded safety can fully remove the role of\nsentiment and confidence, as I think the great financial crisis taught us all, and New Yorkers\nespecially.\n\nThe Impact of Sentiment\nI saw clearly the role of sentiment and confidence in my business experience. Every year, I\nobserved companies make budget assumptions that incorporated their assessments of highly\nuncertain variables, such as the future state of the economy, the actions of their competitors and\n\n-4-\n\n\fchanges in regulation. The CFO typically started from a place of caution, while the business unit\nleaders started with optimism. A debate generally ensued, to be settled by the CEO.\n\nWhen sentiment moved, so did the relative balance of power. Higher confidence led to\naggressive assumptions and lower confidence to the opposite. This affected investment levels,\nhiring levels and discretionary spending. At my old firm, our operating committee debated for\nhours. Sentiment moved our hiring, pricing and spending targets, as well as the amount of risk\nwe were willing to bear.\n\nIn my short Fed experience, I’ve seen it even more clearly. At the end of 2018, the considerable\nuncertainty I described a few minutes ago led to large drops in sentiment. Between December\n2018 and January 2019, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index dropped seven\npoints, the largest one-month decline since 2013. The Conference Board’s measure of CEO\nconfidence also fell significantly in the fourth quarter to its lowest level since 2012. We then saw\nweak numbers in January and February; for example, February retail sales and payroll\nemployment growth were quite low. Perhaps that’s also why inflation in the first quarter was so\nweak. Firms with less confidence have less conviction to push through price increases.\n\nBut sentiment runs both ways. By the end of February, international uncertainty had decreased\nand the shutdown was over. Perhaps our shift to a patient stance on monetary policy helped. The\nmarkets rebounded, as did sentiment. Now the data once again look relatively healthy.\n\n-5-\n\n\fI believe we see the importance of sentiment in monetary policy. One interpretation of policies\nlike forward guidance is that they are a recognition of the power of sentiment and the importance\nof clearly spelling out our intentions to avoid the proliferation of competing views and beliefs\nabout what else we might do. And in my view, sentiment supports the case for quantitative\neasing should we ever find ourselves again confronting the zero lower bound. There is a great\ndeal of analysis that questions the impact of quantitative easing in response to the Great\nRecession, but there is no doubt in my mind that chairman Bernanke whipping out another arrow\nhelped the economy at a time when confidence was fragile.\n\nHas Sentiment Become More Important?\nI want to make the case that sentiment is up in importance—and that at the same time, it has\nbecome more volatile. One indicator might be the increased visibility of this topic in the\nacademic literature over the past 15 years. But more generally, both good and bad news diffuse\nsignificantly more quickly and broadly. We surf the news on our phone 10 times per day. The\nbusiness media is everywhere, even on planes. And the Fed contributes, for example, by having\neven more press conference and speeches.\n\nRelative to a few decades ago, consumers might be more exposed to the vagaries of sentiment. In\n2016, according to the Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances, about 57 percent of middle-aged\nfamilies were invested in the stock market, compared with 40 percent in 1989. 3 And they’re\nmore likely to be invested in index funds that move with the market than with company\nfundamentals. Households also might still be scarred by the effects of the Great Recession;\n\n-6-\n\n\frecent research by Richmond Fed economists found that even six years after the recession ended,\nconsumers were the most uncertain they’d been since the late 1970s. 4\n\nIn addition, the business reaction function has gotten faster. One reason is that CEO shorttermism has increased as activism in the market for corporate control has shifted companies’\nfocus. I also think firms’ resilience is down. They start with lower confidence. I hear from\nbusiness leaders who are still feeling “hungover” from the Great Recession. While economic\nupturns are more likely to die of a heart attack than of old age, the length of the current upturn\nmakes many people nervous that another recession is right around the corner. All of this may be\nexacerbated by higher leverage; according to the Fed’s Financial Stability Report, which was\nreleased just last week, business borrowing relative to GDP is historically high at present.\nLevered companies have a bias toward taking action on negative news, including cutting costs,\nreducing staff and pricing for volume. These all lead to an asymmetry in which firms are much\nmore cautious about the downside than they are optimistic about the upside. 5\n\nImplications for the Economy and Monetary Policy\nLet’s assume I’m correct that sentiment is both more important and more volatile. What are the\nimplications for the economy and for policy?\n\nOne implication, I believe, is that both consumers and businesses have a higher bar for spending\ndecisions, which would tend to reduce consumer spending and lower firms’ investment posture.\nFrom that perspective, it’s possible that some of the tepid recovery from the Great Recession was\na self-fulfilling lack of belief in the strength of the economy. And I see it continuing today with a\n\n-7-\n\n\fnegative tilt or asymmetry, as I discussed before. Firms are frustrated with political polarization\nand uncertainty about regulation. This limits their pricing courage and caps the upside on their\nspending and investment decisions.\n\nFor these reasons, I don’t discount the idea that we could talk ourselves into a recession. Some\neconomists have studied the spread of information from a disease perspective, where the\ninformation spreads slowly at first but quickly gains steam. I would argue that in today’s media\nclimate, the “disease” spreads faster. (Of course, it’s possible that the “disease” could also be\ngood news, but recent research suggests that firms are much more likely to react to negative\neconomic news than positive economic news. 6)\n\nFor monetary policymakers, we have to be aware that our communication matters critically.\nLong gone are the days when we could change rates and then wait for economic actors to discern\nthat change and react. You might have heard the story that for many years people would use the\nsize of Alan Greenspan’s briefcase as a clue to the stance of monetary policy; a thick briefcase\nmeant a rate change, and a thin briefcase meant the status quo. 7 Now, in addition to releasing a\ndetailed statement after every FOMC meeting, the chair gives a press conference. The public also\ngets a lot of information through speeches by other Fed leaders and our Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP, also known as the “dot plots”).\n\nBut it’s worth asking if we’re helping or just confusing things. There might be ways we can\nclarify our communications, such as the chair’s recent efforts to have more press conferences.\n\n-8-\n\n\fWe might also try to simplify communications tools such as the SEP. Such steps are part of the\nreview of our monetary policy framework that is currently being led by Vice Chair Clarida. 8\n\nIt’s also the case that monetary policy becomes about more than interest rates per se. In a volatile\nenvironment, rate moves can indicate more than stimulation or restriction. They are also taken as\nsignals on the health of the economy. Counterintuitively, then, rate moves can send unintended\nmessages. For example, in March the market reacted to a lower median rate path in the SEP by\nlowering inflation expectations. Similarly, when the Fed signaled in mid-2013 that it might begin\nwinding down its bond purchases due to a strengthening economy, investors panicked and a\nglobal sell-off ensued. And this can happen quickly, both when the Fed is removing or adding\naccommodation. We need to recognize communication as a monetary policy transmission\nchannel, acknowledging that this channel adds value to nontraditional measures such as\nquantitative easing.\n\nBeyond the scope of monetary policy, there might be other steps to reduce the asymmetry of\nsentiment, such as providing incentives for productive investment or, more broadly, more\nregulatory certainty. Paying closer attention to corporate debt could increase firms’ resiliency. If\nthe ground beneath them is solid, firms’ memories of the bad times will eventually fade.\n\nKeeping an Ear to the Ground\nI started by talking about myself, and that’s how I’m going to conclude. Since coming to the\nRichmond Fed, I’ve tried to leverage my business background in order to deeply understand\nsentiment. That’s why I prioritize conversations with contacts. My approach to policymaking has\n\n-9-\n\n\fbeen to spend substantial time, each and every FOMC cycle, working to understand and integrate\nthe informal but essential insights of our business and community stakeholders with the\nstatistical analysis and clear reasoning of the economics profession. Examples of this approach\ninclude the close eye I keep on business sentiment surveys, production indices like the one\nproduced by the Institute for Supply Management and diffusion indices, including our own at the\nRichmond Fed. I’ve also reoriented our research team toward external outreach, and we are\nbeefing up our own survey capabilities to better monitor real-time changes in sentiment.\n\nWhen I talk to business leaders in the Fifth District, I ask about budget assumptions. Are you\nplanning for strong, solid or moderate growth? I ask about investment plans. Are you going to\naggressively grow or cut back? And I ask about discretionary spending. This is the first thing\npeople cut back on when their expectations are shaky. I learned that as a consultant.\n\nIn my conversations today, my contacts tell me that the economy is sound but not spectacular.\nConsumer confidence has rebounded, anchored by a strong labor market, good income prospects,\nhealthy credit markets and high savings. Once the environment settled, consumers were ready\nand able to resume spending. But business recovery looks to be slower. They don’t feel they\nhave much pricing power. They are anxious about the future. They worry about political\npolarization and its impact on the environment for investment and regulation. They worry about\ninternational markets and trade and the implications for the global economy. They tell me they\nare maintaining their investment programs but are cautious about funding major expansion. They\nare not cutting back investments or jobs or discretionary spending, at least not yet. As a\n\n-10-\n\n\fconsequence, I still see an economy that is sound. But confidence—especially business\nconfidence—is fragile. It’s our job as policymakers to try to support it.\n\nThank you, and now I welcome your reactions and questions.\n\n1\n\nThank you to Kartik Athreya, Thomas Lubik, Jessie Romero and Pierre-Daniel Sarte for assistance preparing these\nremarks.\n2\nFor example, see Rüdiger Bachmann, Steffen Elstner, and Eric R.

            "content": "A Practitioner’s Perspective on the Productivity Slowdown\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nSandridge Lecture\nVirginia Association of Economists\nRichmond, Virginia\nApril 4, 2019\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you this evening. It’s an honor to be here. While I’m quite\ncertain I won’t coin a phrase as memorable or significant as, say, the “global saving glut,”1 I do\nhope you’ll find what I have to say interesting.\n\nI came to Richmond after a 30-year career at McKinsey in Atlanta, where in addition to\nmanagement consulting I had many line roles, including serving as the CFO. I am deeply\nrespectful and appreciative of the insights created in the field of economics and by my team at\nthe Richmond Fed. Building on both, I hope to leverage my background to bring a unique\nperspective as a businessperson on topics such as pricing, the real drivers of wages, the impact of\ntariffs or tax cuts, and the causes and implications of slower productivity growth. The latter will\nbe the subject of my talk this evening.\n\nYou know why productivity growth matters. In an environment where demographic trends are\ncontributing to slow growth in the labor force, productivity growth is essential for our economy\nto grow. Stronger growth would improve living standards. Stronger growth would create\nrevenues to reduce the federal budget deficit at a time when it seems unlikely to be addressed\n\n-1-\n\n\fotherwise. But since 2006, average annual labor productivity growth has been just 1.3 percent. In\ncontrast, it averaged 2.3 percent between 1985 and 2005. What’s changed?\n\nBefore I try to answer that question, I have to note that the views I express are my own and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.2\n\nThe Productivity Boom\nLet’s start by looking at the 1970s. At that time, general macroeconomic volatility—particularly\nrising and volatile inflation—created an environment that discouraged investing.\n\nIn addition, because the market for corporate control was dormant, companies and CEOs faced\nlimited performance pressure. CEOs were statesmen, as focused on their workforce and their\ncommunities as they were on their shareholders. And many leaders spent their entire careers at\nthe same company, limiting the diffusion of best practices. We also had less foreign competition,\nstrong unions and stricter regulations in many industries. All these factors contributed to average\nlabor productivity growth of 1.6 percent between 1975 and 1985.\n\nI saw the corporate world change significantly during the 1980s and 1990s in ways that drove\nproductivity growth. A strengthened market for corporate control brought about a fundamental\nchange in focus. Investment banks and “corporate raiders” put companies on notice that they had\nto “perform or die.” Stock options became a much larger share of executive compensation, tying\na CEO’s performance more closely to shareholder value.3\n\n-2-\n\n\fCompanies also faced more competition as global trade barriers were eliminated and industries\nwere deregulated. And once inflation was finally tamed, firms had less pricing power and were\nforced to become more efficient in order to maintain their profit margins. The “big box” retail\nformat also drove productivity growth, in large part because monopsonistic buyers could exert\nsignificant pressure on their suppliers to become more efficient themselves. Between 1995 and\n2002, productivity growth in the retail sector averaged nearly 4 percent annually.4\n\nGreater efficiency was made possible by a variety of new practices and new technologies,\nincluding strategic sourcing and outsourcing, re-engineering and lean management, information\ntechnology and internet distribution, to name a few. These practices and technologies spread to\nother companies more quickly via a more robust business press, greater talent mobility and—if I\nmay say so—the growth of management consulting. The result was a productivity boom.\n\nThe Productivity Slowdown\nOver the past decade or so, however, productivity growth has slowed considerably. As a\nbusinessperson, I find this hard to explain. During my consulting career, I worked for large\ncompanies in multiple industries on a range of productivity topics, including manufacturing\nefficiency, overhead reduction and process redesign. I didn’t observe any particular cliff around\n2005. I saw management equally motivated to drive a focus on the bottom line. I saw clients\ncontinuing to invest, to automate and to innovate. And I saw new, powerful practices\nimplemented, such as voice recognition and offshoring. I saw my individual clients get more\nproductive.\n\n-3-\n\n\fI’ve been on a journey to understand what’s going on, recognizing that every sector has its own\nstory. I considered the possibility that the mix of businesses has shifted, for example because of\nthe growth in services or productive sectors moving to foreign locales. But the slowdown is\nwidespread. Nearly every sector has experienced some decline in productivity growth since the\nmid-2000s (although the extent varies across sectors).5\n\nI considered mismeasurement. Some surely exists; for example, the leisure value of free apps on\na smartphone isn’t measured, while the price of toys is. But again, the widespread nature of the\ndecline makes mismeasurement unlikely as an across-the-board explanation.\n\nProductivity growth could also be hampered by regulatory costs and the expense of\nimplementing cybersecurity. Costs have certainly been created that don’t generate revenues. But\nback-of-the-envelope calculations suggest these costs aren’t large enough to explain the\nslowdown.\n\nIt’s also possible that this is just a pause before an acceleration due to AI and digitization. That\nwould be great! But I never saw the pause, and I worry about hope as a strategy.\n\nSome have argued that we’ve already picked all the “low-hanging fruit” when it comes to\ntransformative technologies.6 That’s a depressing thought. But it can’t be true. Spend time with\nany researcher in AI or biotech and your mind will reel with the possibilities.\n\n-4-\n\n\fFinally, at my house, there’s some debate about whether email, texting and social media are\nenablers of productivity or whether they may well be the problem. I’ll leave that debate for\ndinner tonight.\n\nThe Role of Investment\nSo what do I think I know? I believe the decline in productivity growth is real. And I believe that\npart of the cause is at least 15 years of business underinvestment. Recent research has found that\nbetween 2000 and 2015, business investment was low relative to measures of corporate\nprofitability, even when taking into account increased investment in intangible assets.7 This\n“investment gap” has been driven by industry leaders and productivity leaders not investing in\ngrowth the way they once did. Airlines have moderated capacity growth, banks aren’t adding\nbranches and even successful retailers aren’t adding stores. And in my view, it’s easy to draw a\nline from lower investment to lower productivity growth, particularly to the extent large\nincumbent firms drive productivity.8\n\nMany factors might be contributing to lower investment. Short-termism is increasing as CEO\ntenure decreases and corporate activism escalates. Share repurchases and M&A have become\ncompelling alternate uses of capital, especially as more and more industries focus their metrics\non return on capital employed (ROCE). The number of publicly traded firms has fallen more\nthan 50 percent, deferring to private market strategies that manage capital tightly.9 Cyclical\nindustries have learned the lessons of overcapacity. And, finally, some companies are still feeling\n“hungover” from the Great Recession. I’ve spoken with business leaders who, even if they see\n\n-5-\n\n\fopportunities for investment, are reluctant to take them. They continually see the next recession\nas “just around the corner.” You hear that today.\n\nThe good news is investment could come back in the context of a stronger economy. This seems\nto be what recent data suggest. In 2018, year-over-year investment growth was 6.9 percent,\ncompared with 5.2 percent in 2017 and just half a percent in 2016.10 We need that momentum to\ncontinue.\n\nThe Drop in Startups\nAnother factor contributing to slower productivity growth might be declining startup rates.\nSuccessful entrants drive innovation, which drives productivity. But the data show a massive\nreduction in entry rates in all states and all sectors. Startups accounted for 12 percent of all firms\nin the late 1980s. That fell to 10.6 percent in the mid-2000s and to 8 percent after 2008.11 As\nwith investment, some of this decline might reflect lingering risk aversion after the Great\nRecession. Some might be the impact of regulation (for example, there have only been 13 de\nnovo banks in the past nine years). Research also points to the slow growth of the working-age\npopulation and challenges to immigration as explanations.12 In addition, I hear there are tangible\nimpediments—such as acquiring the necessary technology and talent—to building the scale and\nsophistication required to compete in today’s world.\n\nBarriers to Exit\nIn addition, there’s evidence that the dispersion of productivity within industries has increased—\nmore-productive firms are getting more productive, and less-productive firms lag behind.13\n\n-6-\n\n\fWhen we talk to firms at the frontier, productivity gains seem robust. But aggregate productivity\nis potentially being held back by the laggards. This could be occurring because there are greater\nbarriers to the diffusion of productivity enhancements, such as the required investments in\nintellectual property or information technology. And, at the same time the productivity gap is\ngetting wider, less-productive firms have become less likely to exit the market.14 It sounds\ncounterintuitive, but it’s real. Bankruptcies have dropped consistently over time (excepting, of\ncourse, the Great Recession). Perhaps this is a temporary result of the long economic upturn.\nPerhaps the rising median rate of profitability is keeping underperformers afloat, with the\nwinners choosing profit over market share. Or perhaps low interest rates have helped keep lowperforming companies alive.15\n\nThe fact that we’re late in the business cycle is both a challenge and an opportunity. On the one\nhand, marginal hires might be less productive. On the other hand, firms may find themselves\npressed to do more with less, which would boost productivity. The last year has been interesting,\nwith productivity growth averaging 1.7 percent, compared with 1.1 percent in 2017 and just 0.1\npercent in 2016. It’s too early to call a turn, but a former consultant can dream!\n\nProspects of Change\nLet me leave you with the thought that change is possible. Technological innovations such as AI\nand digitization aren’t going away. As the Great Recession fades further into memory, economic\ntailwinds may give both entrepreneurs and existing firms more confidence to invest in their\nbusinesses and grow their markets. Policymakers can help. Corporate leaders need a healthy\nenvironment for business investment and entrepreneurship. As I talk to my contacts, that is their\n\n-7-\n\n\fprimary topic of discussion. “If the rules are clear and the political environment is stable,” they\nsay, “American businesses will find a way to grow.”\n\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions and comments.\n\nBen S.

            "content": "Moving the Needle in Rural Communities\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nVirginia Governor’s Conference on Agricultural Trade\nMarch 5, 2019\nRichmond, Virginia\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you today. It’s an honor to be here, and I appreciate the\nopportunity to discuss such an important sector of our state’s economy.\n\nI came to Richmond a little more than a year ago, after a 30-year career at McKinsey where in\naddition to consulting I held many line roles, including leading our Southern offices and serving\nas CFO. I’ve enjoyed the opportunity to dig into economics, policy and the Fed’s Fifth District,\nwhich spans from Maryland to the Carolinas. In my talk today, I could say a lot about the\n$91 billion agriculture and forestry contributes to Virginia’s economy; about the fact that exports\naccount for about 10 percent of these industries;1 or about how little economists generally like\nrestricting trade.2 But you’re experts, as are the speakers lined up for today.\n\nInstead, I would like to talk about the communities that depend on trade. There are about 150\ncounties in the United States that depend on exports for more than one-quarter of their GDP.\nNearly all of them have fewer than 100,000 residents—and about half have fewer than 25,000\nresidents.3 (To put that in perspective, Chesterfield County has almost 350,000 residents.) As\nI’ve traveled around our District, I’ve seen small towns that represent the best of what our\n\n-1-\n\n\fcountry has to offer. But I’ve also seen many communities that have lost ground relative to\nbigger cities. They deserve our attention, especially to the extent trade issues affect them further.\n\nBefore I say more, I have to note that the views I express are my own and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHow Are Smaller Markets Different?\nSmaller towns are different from bigger cities. Part is demographic: Small-town populations tend\nto be older and have less formal education. Part is geographic: Smaller towns often are more\nremote and don’t have the population density to support large institutions. In addition, small\ntowns have what we call “thinner” markets, ones with fewer employers. So if dislocation hits\neven one sizable employer, the whole town feels it.\n\nThese differences lead to different labor market outcomes. Across the United States, the\nemployment/population ratio for people between 16 and 64 is about 10 percentage points higher\nin urban areas than in smaller towns. In the Fifth District, the gap is almost 11 percentage\npoints.4 The Fed’s mandate includes maximum employment, so we care about gaps in labor\nmarket outcomes.\n\nThe solutions will vary from place to place. A coal-mining town in West Virginia doesn’t\nnecessarily face the same challenges as a community on the Eastern Shore of Maryland or a farm\ntown in central Virginia. But broadly speaking, research suggests four core themes to move the\nneedle in these communities: education, connection, de-isolation and participation.\n\n-2-\n\n\fTheme 1: Education\nLet’s start with the first and arguably the most important -- education or, more broadly, preparing\npeople to enter the workforce. On average, people with bachelor’s degrees earn more money, are\nmore likely to be employed and even have better health outcomes. But rural residents are less\nlikely to have a bachelor’s degree. In the United States, 35 percent of urban residents between\nthe ages of 25 and 64 have a four-year degree, compared with 22 percent of people in smaller\ntowns. The gap is even bigger in the Fifth District: 17 percentage points. All else equal, the\nRichmond Fed has estimated that if educational attainment in rural areas equaled that of urban\nareas, the employment/population gap in the District would shrink by 40 percent.\n\nBut the answer isn’t just to send more kids to college, because a large share of students who\nenroll don’t graduate. We also have to focus on preparing people for college, and an important\nplace to start is early childhood education. That’s because there’s a tremendous amount of\nevidence that “skills beget skills.” Early childhood education lays the foundation for later\nlearning, both cognitive and noncognitive (or “soft”) skills. Many studies have found that\nchildren who attend a high-quality preschool are likely to have higher test scores, higher\neducational attainment, higher adult earnings and lower rates of incarceration and teen\npregnancy.5 One study suggests attending pre-K boosts high school graduation rates by\n11 percentage points.6\n\n-3-\n\n\fThe availability of early childhood education also matters for parents. Greater access to highquality child care, including full-day preschool, has been shown to increase women’s labor force\nparticipation.7 Yet nearly 60 percent of rural communities are so-called “child care deserts,” with\nfew or no options for licensed child care.8 That contributes to a gap in early childhood\nenrollment between bigger cities and smaller towns. In the Fifth District, 20 percent fewer smalltown 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in pre-K. There are school districts in our region where\nfewer than 30 percent of third-graders can read at grade level and barely 60 percent of students\ngraduate from high school—imagine the possibilities if we could increase these communities’\naccess to high-quality early childhood education.\n\nOf course, there are serious obstacles to scaling up pre-K, particularly in small towns where\nchildren and families are more dispersed and it might be harder to recruit teachers. But it’s not\nimpossible. Oklahoma and Georgia, for example, have offered nearly universal pre-K for\nroughly two decades, raising preschool enrollment in rural areas 24 percent.9 West Virginia has\nbeen working to expand its program since the early 2000s, and pre-K is now offered in all of the\nstate’s 55 counties. I’m also interested in the results of programs like KidsReadyNC,10 which is\nproviding four rural counties in the state with assistance in program design and data monitoring\nto achieve a measure of success on one of the pathways the state has established. The Richmond\nFed has supported this program by providing the staffing and technical assistance for the\ncommunity asset mapping and financing sessions.\n\nLet me stress, however, that while the return on investment for preschool is quite large, it’s not a\nsilver bullet. Early childhood education is a vital first step. The academic gains of pre-K can fade\n\n-4-\n\n\fif children subsequently attend lower-quality schools, so we must continue to invest in improving\nK-12 education.\n\nTheme 2: Connection\nNext, I’d like to talk about connection: facilitating workers’ access to good jobs. I’ve talked\nabout the benefits of obtaining a bachelor’s degree. But attending a four-year college isn’t\nnecessarily the right path for everyone, and there are well-paying jobs that don’t require a fouryear degree. Career and technical education in high school and community colleges also are\nimportant pieces of the puzzle. They’re relatively low-cost ways for students to focus their\nefforts, learn about themselves and get additional preparation.11\n\nWe’re seeing more and more productive collaborations between schools and employers to\nprovide small-town residents with in-demand skills. For example, there is a looming shortage of\npower line workers as many current workers near retirement age. So in 2015, Virginia’s electric\ncooperatives partnered with Southside Virginia Community College to develop a training\nprogram that provides students with hands-on experience and sought-after credentials. Also in\nVirginia, Patrick Henry Community College is partnering with the Harvest Foundation and local\nemployers to train students in three fast-growing local sectors—health care, welding and\nadvanced manufacturing. And I was recently in Greenville, North Carolina, where Pitt\nCommunity College is developing training programs specific to the needs of the many\npharmaceutical companies locating in the area. These partnerships are good for employers, who\nneed skilled workers, and they’re good for the students, who get a direct entrée to a quality job.\nThe school plays a critical connector role.\n\n-5-\n\n\fThe keys to scaling these programs are funding and one-to-one student intervention. Programs\nlike these aren’t cheap, and many community colleges, particularly in small towns, are struggling\nwith declining enrollment and slowing revenue growth. Southside Virginia, Patrick Henry and\nPitt are benefiting from private-sector foundation grants, state grants and industry investment.\nBut, increasingly, businesses are finding that these investments pay off.\n\nMany community college students also face obstacles to completion such as inadequate\nacademic preparation or the need for child care or transportation. Successful initiatives help\nstudents address these challenges. That’s the goal of programs like Tennessee Promise and\nTennessee Reconnect, which provide students with mentors and “navigators” to help them stay\non track. Here in Virginia, the Rural Virginia Horseshoe Initiative places community college\nemployees in high schools to serve as “career coaches” for students. And a growing number of\ncommunity colleges participate in SingleStop, a program that consolidates access to social\nservices. After SingleStop expanded to North Carolina in 2015, researchers found that students\nwho participated attempted and earned more credits than students who didn’t.12\n\nTheme 3: De-Isolation\nThird, let me discuss isolation. While it’s almost definitional, any effort to help those outside our\nlargest cities needs to address a core challenge: social and geographic remoteness.\n\nWith respect to social remoteness, I don’t mean to imply that there aren’t strong social networks\nin place. On the contrary. Rural residents often report feeling stronger ties to their community\n\n-6-\n\n\fand their neighbors than people in other areas. That’s why it’s not helpful for a policymaker like\nme to say, “Everyone should just move to the big cities where the jobs are.” Instead, we have to\ntalk about improving the opportunities in these small towns.\n\nThat requires addressing the informational and institutional gaps that often exist. For example,\nfamily, friends, neighbors and coworkers play a fundamental role in people’s aspirations and\ndecisions about education and work.13 So if you live in an area where fewer adults have attended\ncollege, you might be less likely to view college as an option for yourself. Or, if you live in a\nmore remote area, college reps might not come visit your high school. This is borne out by the\ndata. Even controlling for academic preparation and income, some research has found that rural\nstudents are less likely to apply to high-resource colleges.14\n\nThe disappearance of anchor institutions such as banks, hospitals and colleges is part of the\nchallenge. The number of rural “banking deserts” (counties with fewer than two bank branches\nper 10,000 residents) in the Fifth District roughly doubled between 2012 and 2017, from 18 to\n37. Twelve rural hospitals in our District have closed since 2010. Another 21 hospitals—nearly\n20 percent of those in our District—are at high financial risk of closing. Many rural colleges also\nface serious financial struggles. Ten in our District have closed their doors since 2000.15 The loss\nof these institutions creates direct costs in terms of residents’ access to financial services, health\ncare and education. But there are also large indirect costs. Anchor institutions provide civic\nleaders and high-skilled workers who can raise the aspirations of those around them. They invest\nin their communities and educate residents about health, careers or finances. They supply\n\n-7-\n\n\famenities that attract talent. They create incentives for other businesses and signal a\ncommunity’s vibrancy.\n\nI’m intrigued by initiatives that work to “thicken” these “thin” markets. Some states work to\nplace state and federal government institutions (such as state agencies or military bases) into\nsmaller towns, and greater investments in rural hospitals might be a benefit of Virginia’s recent\nMedicaid expansion. Some colleges have successfully revamped their focus. Emory and Henry\nCollege, in Southwest Virginia, recently launched new professional training programs in\noccupational and physical therapy—which will also help to meet the community’s growing need\nfor medical care. In addition, many people are interested in the effects of increasing broadband\naccess. In my view, the effects are likely to be greatest when that access facilitates workforce\ndevelopment. In 2006, for example, Wilson, North Carolina, a small city about 50 miles east of\nRaleigh, decided to build its own broadband network. Since then, “Project Greenlight” has\nconnected the city’s business development center to new firms, created new distance-learning\nprograms in the city’s schools and even helped train firefighters.\n\nI’m also interested in investments to bring the community to struggling families, in ways that\nbroaden their perspectives and improve their fortunes. While I was in Greenville, for example, I\nlearned about the Conetoe Family Life Center, which provides children and families with access\nto education and health services, supported by a community garden and beekeeping program.\nThey work to break down isolation.\n\nTheme 4: Participation\n\n-8-\n\n\fFinally, I want to discuss two impediments to labor force participation: disability and addiction.\nIn the Fifth District’s smaller towns, 6.7 percent of the residents between the ages of 16 and 64\nreceive disability insurance, compared with 3.8 percent of residents in larger cities. This\ninsurance is a vital safety net for many of our citizens, but there is also some evidence that the\nstate of the overall economy influences disability rolls. I’m hopeful the gap will narrow if job\nprospects improve, and in fact there’s some evidence this is happening in the United States more\nbroadly as the labor market tightens.\n\nOpioid addiction is a tragedy that knows no geographic or social boundaries, but it may be more\nconcentrated in rural areas. In the Fifth District, average opioid prescription rates are almost 30\npercent higher in smaller towns versus bigger cities, and overdose death rates are higher as well.\nWith respect to the effects on the labor market, it’s very hard to disentangle cause and effect, but\nsome preliminary research suggests that the increase in opioid prescription rates between 1999\nand 2015 could account for 43 percent of the decline in prime-age men’s labor force\nparticipation.16 There’s no easy solution, but there are promising addiction-to-work programs,\nsuch as CARITAS Works in Virginia, which could help mitigate the effects of addiction.\n\nConclusion\nThe Richmond Fed has a real opportunity—and responsibility—to improve our understanding of\nthe challenges people face and to search for opportunities to help them meet those challenges.\nWe, along with our colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System, can bring our research to\nbear to help make a difference. We are also actively working to make a difference through a\nvariety of community development initiatives17 and programs such as Invest in What’s Next,\n\n-9-\n\n\fwhich helps high school students weigh the costs and benefits of various postsecondary options\nand choose the path that’s best for them.\n\nI’ve encountered arguments that the challenges of distressed rural communities are too difficult\nto solve. They’re not. I’m old enough to remember when there was a similar pessimism about\nour major cities, which appeared during the 1970s and 1980s to be doomed to perpetual decline.\nThey weren’t.\n\nFrom my perspective, the first step in thinking about the problems of these areas is to approach\nthem as solvable—by good policymaking, by markets, by local leaders and by rural residents\nthemselves.18 Thank you, and I look forward to your reactions and questions.\n\n1\n\nTerance J.

            "content": "Ensuring Longer-Term Growth\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nGreater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce\n2019 Economic Forecast\nRaleigh, North Carolina\nJanuary 10, 2019\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you this morning. I’d like to start by telling you a little bit\nabout myself and what we’re hoping to accomplish at the Richmond Fed. I’ll then turn to our\ncountry’s prospects for sustained economic growth, particularly several critical levers. And then\nI’m looking forward to taking your questions. Before I say more, I have to note that the views I\nexpress are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\n“On the Ground” in the Fifth District\nI came to Richmond a year ago after a 30-year career at McKinsey in Atlanta, where in addition\nto consulting I had many line roles, including CFO. While there, I had the opportunity to serve\non the Atlanta Fed’s Board of Directors, and I was inspired by the role the Bank played during\nthe financial crisis and by its broader role in the community. When I got the phone call about the\njob in Richmond, I was nearing retirement. I thought it would be a wonderful chance to keep\ngiving back and (more selfishly) to keep learning and growing.\n\nSo what am I hoping to accomplish? First, I hope to bring a different perspective to the FOMC.\nMy colleagues are quite talented economists, regulators and bankers. But I hope I bring a unique\n\n\fperspective as a businessperson on topics such as pricing, the impact of tariffs or tax cuts and the\nreal drivers of wages, to name a few.\n\nTo make that effective, I want to be “on the ground” throughout our District, which spans from\nMaryland to the Carolinas. During the past year, I’ve done just that—traveling pretty much\nnonstop (although still less than I traveled as a consultant). I am in North Carolina every month.\n\nAs I’ve traveled, I’ve seen areas of our District that are thriving and areas that are struggling. I\nthink the Richmond Fed has a real opportunity—and responsibility—to improve our\nunderstanding of the challenges people face and to search for opportunities to make a difference.\nFor example, there are large disparities in employment, education and earnings between urban\nand rural areas, and also within urban areas. In North Carolina, about 36 percent of adults in\nurban areas have at least a bachelor’s degree, compared to just 20 percent in rural areas, and the\nlabor force participation rate for working-age adults is nearly four percentage points higher in\nurban areas. And even here in Raleigh, which is one of the most vibrant cities in our District, 15\npercent of families with children younger than 18 live below the federal poverty level.\n\nEconomic Growth\nLet’s turn to the national economy. GDP growth averaged 3.3 percent through the third quarter\nof 2018; consumer spending has been robust; inflation is roughly at target; and the\nunemployment rate remains near a 50-year low at 3.9 percent, with more job openings than\npeople looking for work. In fact, we saw in the December employment report that the economy\nadded more than 312,000 jobs in the last month of the year—a very strong finish. In that context,\n\n-2-\n\n\fthe Fed has been returning rates toward normal levels, most recently in December. I forecast\ngrowth to continue this year, though at a somewhat slower pace. But as we enter 2019, I hear a\nlot of concern. Some is environmental, driven by trade, international economies or politics. Some\nis market driven, as volatility has increased and the yield curve has narrowed. Some is margin\npressure. But overall, the question I hear most is, “How long can this growth continue?” After a\nnine-year expansion—one of the longest on record—it’s a fair question to ask.\n\nI’m actually not going to focus too closely on 2019. Instead, I’d like to focus on the longer term;\nit’s often easier to look out at the horizon than down at your feet. For example, even for 2020,\nyou’ll see a pretty wide range of opinions. The Office of Management and Budget forecasts 2020\nGDP growth of 3 percent, while the Congressional Budget Office and the Fed’s most recent\nSummary of Economic Projections put growth closer to 2 percent.\n\nWith appropriate humility about all of our forecasting records, I thought I might lay out what\nneeds to happen to sustain growth at the high end of the forecast range and where some of the\ncritical levers lie.\n\nBefore I do, let me emphasize why high-end growth matters. Stronger growth is the sign of a\nhealthy economy. Stronger growth creates revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit at a time\nwhen it seems unlikely to be addressed otherwise. Stronger growth improves everyone’s living\nstandards.\n\n-3-\n\n\fLet me also emphasize that the levers for growth range far from monetary policy, and are well\nbeyond the Fed’s powers and its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable\nprices. But here we go.\n\nPopulation and Labor Force Growth\nAt one level, the math of economic growth is pretty simple. More people need to work, and/or\nthey need to be more productive. With respect to the workforce, the native-born population is\ngrowing slowly, and the Census Bureau projects it will slow even more in the future. (It’s not\njust the United States; fertility rates have fallen in nearly every developed country.) Since the\n1990s, immigration has driven about half of the growth in the labor force, but that trend is under\nthreat, as there are proposals to reduce even legal immigration.\n\nAt the same time population growth is slowing, a smaller share of the population is working.\nSince the early 2000s, labor force participation has declined around 4 percentage points. A large\npart of this is demographics, as my generation retires and more young people attend college.\nThat means to grow the economy, people need to come off the sidelines. Which segments offer\nthe greatest potential?\n\nOur country’s largest metro areas are thriving, while many smaller cities and rural areas are\nstruggling. In our District, the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers in rural\nareas is almost 6 points lower than it is in urban areas. If the employment-to-population ratio for\nprime-age workers across the country as a whole were equal to the ratio for counties in the\n\n-4-\n\n\flargest metro areas, an additional 3.5 million people would be working. More than 840,000 of\nthese workers would be in our District alone.\n\nPeople with less education face challenges in the labor market. The employment-to-population\nratio for people with only a high school degree is less than 56 percent, while for those with at\nleast a bachelor’s degree it’s around 72 percent. Closing this gap would put more than 10 million\nadditional people to work.\n\nWomen’s labor force participation, after rising steadily for four decades, leveled off and then\nbegan to decline around 2000. This is a divergence from other developed countries. In the late\n1990s, the participation rate for prime-age women in Canada was the same as in the United\nStates. Now it is 8 points higher. If the United States had the same participation rate as Canada,\nan additional 5.2 million women would join the labor force.\n\nThe net is a challenge for growing our economy. Unless immigration increases or people come\noff the sidelines, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the labor force will grow just 0.6 percent\nannually over the next decade.\n\nProductivity Growth\nThe second half of the growth equation is productivity. Between 1985 and 2005, the United\nStates had a productivity boom, with average annual growth of 2.3 percent. I saw a number of\ndrivers, including an increased emphasis on shareholder value in the corporate sector,\nderegulation that increased competition and reduced global trade barriers. Productivity also\n\n-5-\n\n\fincreased due to new technologies that enabled efficiency, such as automation, internet\ndistribution, global sourcing and outsourcing, and lean management. At the same time, these\ntechnologies spread through enhanced diffusion via the business press, greater talent mobility\nand, if I may say so, growth in consulting.\n\nOver the past decade or so, however, productivity growth has slowed—just 1.3 percent average\nannual growth between 2006 and the present. I find this very surprising from my perspective as a\nbusinessperson, as I didn’t observe any particular cliff around 2005. In fact, I saw management\nequally motivated to drive a focus on the bottom line. I saw clients continuing to invest, to\nautomate and to drive operating performance. And I saw new, powerful practices being\nimplemented, such as artificial intelligence, offshoring overhead, voice recognition and\ndigitization. In short, I saw my individual clients get more productive.\n\nI’ve been on a journey to understand what’s going on, recognizing that every sector has its own\nstory. One possibility is that the mix of businesses has shifted, for example because of the growth\nin services or offshoring productive sectors. But the slowdown is widespread. Nearly every\nsector has experienced some decline in productivity growth since the mid-2000s (although the\nextent varies across sectors). 2\n\nAnother possibility is mismeasurement. Some surely exists; for example, the leisure value of free\napps on a smartphone isn’t measured, while toys are. But again, the widespread nature of the\ndecline makes mismeasurement unlikely as an across-the-board explanation.\n\n-6-\n\n\fMaybe this is just the pause before an acceleration due to AI and digitization. That would be\ngreat! But I never saw the pause in practice, and I worry about hope as a strategy.\n\nSo what do I think I know? I believe the productivity slowdown is real, and part of the\nexplanation is nearly two decades of business underinvestment. Since 2000, investment has been\nlow relative to measures of corporate profitability, driven by industry leaders not investing in\ngrowth the way they once did. 3 Airlines have moderated capacity growth, banks aren’t adding\nbranches and even successful retailers aren’t adding stores. And in my view, it’s easy to draw a\nline from lower investment to lower productivity growth.\n\nThat leads me to the question, why has investment been low? My sense is that short-termism is\nincreasing as CEO tenure decreases and corporate activism escalates. Share repurchases have\nbecome a compelling alternate use of capital. Cyclical industries have learned the lessons of\nover-capacity. And finally, some companies are still feeling hungover from the Great Recession.\nFor example, I’ve spoken with business leaders who, even if they see opportunities for\ninvestment, are reluctant to take them. They continually see the next recession as “just around\nthe corner.” As I said earlier, that’s a real issue today, as the economy’s numbers look strong but\nbusiness sentiment has weakened considerably.\n\nAnother factor in slowing productivity growth is declining start-up rates. Successful entrants\ndrive innovation, which drives productivity. But the data show a massive reduction in entry rates,\nin all states and all sectors. Start-ups accounted for 12 percent of all firms in the late 1980s. That\nfell to 10.6 percent in the mid-2000s, and to 8 percent after 2008. 4 As with investment, some of\n\n-7-\n\n\fthis decline might be lingering risk aversion after the Great Recession. Some might be the impact\nof regulation. Research also points to the slow growth of the working age population as an\nexplanation. 5 In addition, I hear that there are tangible impediments—such as acquiring the\nnecessary technology and talent—to building the scale and sophistication entrants require to be\nsuccessful.\n\nWhat To Do?\nIf the workforce grows just 0.6 percent per year, and productivity growth continues at about\n1.3 percent annually, “trend” core growth is only in the 1.9 percent range—far slower than today.\nThat’s the driver of the lower estimates you see. So what can be done to change that trend?\n\nThe first step is to look at policies that could help draw more people back to the labor force, such\nas policies to support women’s participation in the workforce. One of the biggest differences\nbetween the United States and other developed countries is the availability of paid leave and\nsubsidized child care, both of which have been shown to increase women’s labor force\nparticipation. 6\n\nAs I noted a few minutes ago, people with less education are less likely to be working. So\nanother critical area is workforce development initiatives to help people improve their skills.\nThis is particularly important in rural and inner-city communities. It starts with programs to help\nadult workers acquire in-demand skills. But workforce development needs to start much earlier,\nat the K-12 level or even in early childhood. 7 In this way, students who want to attend college\ncan receive the preparation they need to graduate, because far too many students do not. Roughly\n\n-8-\n\n\f40 percent of students who enroll in a four-year college don’t graduate within six years, and\nmany of those who leave without a degree are still left with significant debt. The workforce can\ngrow if students who enter college can graduate, and young people have, and know about, viable\nalternatives to four-year colleges.\n\nIn addition, legal immigration is a huge opportunity to grow our workforce and increase our\ncountry’s human capital and entrepreneurial energy. I empathize with concerns that immigration\ncould be detrimental to the employment and wages of Americans. But the economic research\nshows that immigration creates consumers and boosts productivity and start-up rates. 8 Our\ncountry’s competitive advantage is that the most talented people in the world want to live here.\nThat’s why so many of our grandparents came and started businesses (in my family’s case, a\nshoe store and doughnut shop). Our country should embrace this advantage.\n\nSpeaking of productivity, the United States needs to promote a healthy environment for business\ninvestment. Business investment has grown significantly in five of the last six quarters. But, as I\nsaid, uncertainty is currently a real issue for the businesspeople I’ve spoken with throughout our\nDistrict. This is particularly true when it comes to trade, but it’s also an issue in sectors such as\nhealth care, where the regulatory environment is unclear. American businesses are practical and\ninnovative. If the rules are clear and the political environment is stable, they will find a way to\ngrow.\n\n-9-\n\n\fConclusion\nIn sum, the United States faces a slower growth trend that isn’t in any of our interests. Changing\nthe slope is doable via initiatives to expand the workforce and boost productivity growth. It’s an\nopportunity this country can’t afford to pass up.\n\nThank you, and I welcome your reactions and questions.\n\nThank you to Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nMartin Baily and Nicholas Montalbano, “Why is U.S. Productivity Growth So Slow?” Brookings Institution Hutchins\nCenter Working Paper no. 22, September 2016.\n3\nGerman Gutierrez and Thomas Philipon, “Investmentless Growth: An Empirical Investigation,” Brookings Papers\non Economic Activity, Fall 2017.\n4\nRyan Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “The Role of Entrepreneurship in U.S. Job\nCreation and Economic Dynamism,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, Summer 2014, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 3–24.\n5\nFatih Karahan, Benjamin Pugsley, and Aysegul Sahin, “Demographic Origins of the Startup Deficit,” Manuscript,\nMay 2018.\n6\nJanet Yellen, “So We All Can Succeed: 125 Years of Women's Participation in the Economy,” Speech at Brown\nUniversity, Providence, Rhode Island, May 5, 2017.\n7\nFor example, see Kartik B.

But I hope I bring a unique\nperspective as a businessperson on topics such as pricing, the impact of tariffs or tax cuts and the\nreal drivers of wages, to name a few.\n\nTo make that effective, I want to be “on the ground” throughout our District, which spans from\nMaryland to the Carolinas. During the past year, I’ve done just that—traveling pretty much\nnonstop (although still less than I traveled as a consultant). I am trying to be in Maryland every\nmonth.\n\nAs I’ve traveled, I’ve seen areas of our District that are thriving and areas that are struggling. I\nthink the Richmond Fed has a real opportunity—and responsibility—to improve our\nunderstanding of the challenges people face and to search for opportunities to make a difference.\nFor example, there are large disparities in employment, education and earnings between urban\nand rural areas, and also within urban areas. Here in Baltimore, at the same time new shops and\nrestaurants are being built on Pratt Street and apartment towers are rising on Light Street, there\nare parts of the city where people can’t find jobs and rowhouses sit vacant. We can bring our\nresearch to bear to help change things.\n\n-2-\n\n\fEconomic Growth\nLet’s turn to the national economy. I don’t need to tell this group that it looked very strong in\n2018. GDP growth averaged 3.3 percent through the third quarter; consumer spending has been\nstrong; there are more job openings than people looking for jobs, as unemployment reached a\nnearly 50-year low of 3.7 percent; and inflation is roughly at target. In that context, the Fed has\nbeen returning rates toward normal levels, most recently in December. I forecast growth to\ncontinue this year, though at a somewhat slower pace. But as we enter 2019, I hear a lot of\nconcern. Some is environmental, driven by trade or politics. Some is market driven, as volatility\nhas increased and the yield curve has narrowed. Some is margin pressure. But overall, the\nquestion I hear most is, “How long can this growth continue?”\n\nThat’s the question we’re here today to discuss, but I’m actually not going to focus too closely\non 2019. Instead, I’d like to focus on the longer term; it’s often easier to look out at the horizon\nthan down at your feet. For example, even for 2020, you’ll see a pretty wide range of opinions.\nThe Office of Management and Budget forecasts 2020 GDP growth of 3 percent, while the\nCongressional Budget Office and the Fed’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections put\ngrowth closer to 2 percent.\n\nWith appropriate humility about all of our forecasting records, I thought I might lay out what\nneeds to happen to sustain growth at the high end of the forecast range and where some of the\ncritical levers lie.\n\n-3-\n\n\fBefore I do, let me emphasize why high-end growth matters. Stronger growth is the sign of a\nhealthy economy. Stronger growth creates revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit at a time\nwhen it seems unlikely to be addressed otherwise. Stronger growth improves everyone’s living\nstandards.\n\nLet me also emphasize that the levers for growth range far from monetary policy, and are well\nbeyond the Fed’s powers and its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable\nprices. But here we go.\n\nPopulation and Labor Force Growth\nAt one level, the math of economic growth is pretty simple. More people need to work, and/or\nthey need to be more productive. With respect to the workforce, the native-born population is\ngrowing slowly, and the Census Bureau projects it will slow even more in the future. (It’s not\njust the United States; fertility rates have fallen in nearly every developed country.) Since the\n1990s, immigration has driven about half of the growth in the labor force, but that trend is under\nthreat, as there are proposals to reduce even legal immigration.\n\nAt the same time population growth is slowing, a smaller share of the population is working.\nSince the early 2000s, labor force participation has declined around 4 percentage points. A large\npart of this is demographics, as my generation retires and more young people attend college.\nThat means to grow the economy, people need to come off the sidelines. Which segments offer\nthe greatest potential?\n\n-4-\n\n\fOur country’s largest metro areas are thriving, while many smaller cities and rural areas are\nstruggling. In our District, the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers in rural\nareas is almost 6 points lower than it is in urban areas. If the employment-to-population ratio for\nprime-age workers across the country as a whole were equal to the ratio for counties in the\nlargest metro areas, an additional 3.5 million people would be working. More than 840,000 of\nthese workers would be in the Fifth District alone.\n\nPeople with less education face challenges in the labor market. The employment-to-population\nratio for people with only a high school degree is less than 56 percent, while for those with at\nleast a bachelor’s degree it’s around 72 percent. Closing this gap would put more than 10 million\nadditional people to work.\n\nWomen’s labor force participation, after rising steadily for four decades, leveled off and then\nbegan to decline around 2000. This is a divergence from other developed countries. In the late\n1990s, the participation rate for prime-age women in Canada was the same as in the United\nStates. Now it is 8 points higher. If the United States had the same participation rate as Canada,\nan additional 5.2 million women would join the labor force.\n\nAnother challenge we’re all too familiar with in the Fifth District is the opioid epidemic.\nMaryland, D.C. and especially West Virginia are among the top seven states for overdose death\nrates. With respect to the labor market, it’s hard to tease out cause and effect—do people abuse\nopioids while they’re out of work, or are they unable to work because they have a drug abuse\nproblem? But some research does suggest that the epidemic has had a direct effect on labor force\n\n-5-\n\n\fparticipation, lowering it by as much as 4.6 percentage points for prime-age men in counties with\nhigher rates of opioid prescriptions. 2\n\nThe net is a challenge for growing our economy. Unless immigration increases or people come\noff the sidelines, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the labor force will grow just 0.6 percent\nannually over the next decade.\n\nProductivity Growth\nThe second half of the growth equation is productivity. Between 1985 and 2005, the United\nStates had a productivity boom, with average annual growth of 2.3 percent. I see a number of\ndrivers, including an increased emphasis on shareholder value in the corporate sector,\nderegulation that increased competition and reduced global trade barriers. Productivity also\nincreased due to new technologies that enabled efficiency, such as automation, internet\ndistribution, global sourcing and outsourcing, and lean management. At the same time, these\ntechnologies spread through enhanced diffusion via the business press, greater talent mobility\nand, if I may say so, growth in consulting.\n\nOver the past decade or so, however, productivity growth has slowed—just 1.3 percent average\nannual growth between 2006 and the present. I find this very surprising from my perspective as a\nbusinessperson, as I didn’t observe any particular cliff around 2005. In fact, I saw management\nequally motivated to drive a focus on the bottom line. I saw clients continuing to invest, to\nautomate and to drive operating performance. And I saw new, powerful practices being\n\n-6-\n\n\fimplemented, such as artificial intelligence, offshoring overhead, voice recognition and\ndigitization. In short, I saw my individual clients get more productive.\n\nI’ve been on a journey to understand what’s going on, recognizing that every sector has its own\nstory. One possibility is that the mix of businesses has shifted, for example because of the growth\nin services or offshoring productive sectors. But the slowdown is widespread. Nearly every\nsector has experienced some decline in productivity growth since the mid-2000s (although the\nextent varies across sectors). 3\n\nAnother possibility is mismeasurement. Some surely exists; for example, the leisure value of free\napps on a smartphone isn’t measured, while toys are. But again, the widespread nature of the\ndecline makes mismeasurement unlikely as an across-the-board explanation.\n\nMaybe this is just the pause before an acceleration due to AI and digitization. That would be\ngreat! But I never saw the pause in practice, and I worry about hope as a strategy.\n\nFinally, for this audience, I’ve thought about regulatory burdens and the cost of cybersecurity.\nClearly costs have been created that don’t create revenues. But these costs can’t explain all the\nslowdown in this sector or across sectors.\n\nSo what do I think I know? I believe the productivity slowdown is real, and part of the\nexplanation is nearly two decades of business underinvestment. Since 2000, investment has been\nlow relative to measures of corporate profitability, driven by industry leaders not investing in\n\n-7-\n\n\fgrowth the way they once did. 4 Airlines have moderated capacity growth, banks aren’t adding\nbranches and even successful retailers aren’t adding stores. And in my view, it’s easy to draw a\nline from lower investment to lower productivity growth.\n\nThat leads me to the question, why has investment been low? My sense is that short-termism is\nincreasing as CEO tenure decreases and corporate activism escalates. In addition, share\nrepurchases have become a compelling alternate use of capital. And finally, some companies are\nstill feeling hungover from the Great Recession. For example, I’ve spoken with business leaders\nwho, even if they see opportunities for investment, are reluctant to take them. They continually\nsee the next recession as “just around the corner.” As I said earlier, that’s a real issue today, as\nthe economy’s numbers look strong but business sentiment has weakened considerably.\n\nAnother factor in slowing productivity growth is declining start-up rates. Successful entrants\ndrive innovation, which drives productivity. But the data show a massive reduction in entry rates,\nin all states and all sectors. Start-ups accounted for 12 percent of all firms in the late 1980s. That\nfell to 10.6 percent in the mid-2000s, and to 8 percent after 2008. 5 I certainly see this in the\nbanking sector, with only 13 de novo banks since 2010, compared to hundreds each year before\nthe financial crisis (not that hundreds is necessarily the target). As with investment, some of this\ndecline might be lingering risk aversion after the Great Recession. Some might be the impact of\nregulation. Research also points to the slow growth of the working age population as an\nexplanation. 6 In addition, I hear that there are tangible impediments—such as acquiring the\nnecessary technology and talent—to building the scale and sophistication entrants require to be\nsuccessful.\n\n-8-\n\n\fWhat To Do?\nIf the workforce grows just 0.6 percent per year, and productivity growth continues at about\n1.3 percent annually, “trend” core growth is only in the 1.9 percent range—far slower than today.\nThat’s the driver of the lower estimates you see. So what can be done to change that trend?\n\nThe first step is to look at policies that could help draw more people back to the labor force, such\nas policies to support women’s participation in the workforce. One of the biggest differences\nbetween the United States and other developed countries is the availability of paid leave and\nsubsidized child care, both of which have been shown to increase women’s labor force\nparticipation. 7\n\nAs I noted a few minutes ago, people with less education are less likely to be working. So\nanother critical area is workforce development initiatives to help people improve their skills.\nThis is particularly important in rural and inner-city communities. It starts with programs to help\nadult workers acquire in-demand skills. But workforce development needs to start much earlier,\nat the K-12 level or even in early childhood. 8 In this way, students who want to attend college\ncan receive the preparation they need to graduate, because far too many students do not. Roughly\n40 percent of students who enroll in a four-year college don’t graduate within six years, and\nmany of those who leave without a degree are still left with significant debt. The workforce can\ngrow if students who enter college can graduate, and young people have, and know about, viable\nalternatives to four-year colleges.\n\n-9-\n\n\fIn addition, legal immigration is a huge opportunity to grow our workforce and increase our\ncountry’s human capital and entrepreneurial energy. I empathize with concerns that immigration\ncould be detrimental to the employment and wages of Americans. But the economic research\nshows that immigration boosts productivity and start-up rates. 9 Our country’s competitive\nadvantage is that the most talented people in the world want to live here. That’s why so many of\nour grandparents came and started businesses (in my family’s case, a shoe store and doughnut\nshop). Our country should embrace this advantage.\n\nSpeaking of productivity, the United States needs to promote a healthy environment for business\ninvestment. Business investment has grown significantly in five of the last six quarters. But, as I\nsaid, uncertainty is currently a real issue for the businesspeople I’ve spoken with throughout our\nDistrict. This is particularly true when it comes to trade, but it’s also an issue in sectors such as\nhealth care, where the regulatory environment is unclear. American businesses are practical and\ninnovative. If the rules are clear and the political environment is stable, they will find a way to\ngrow.\n\nConclusion\nIn sum, the United States faces a slow growth trend that isn’t in any of our interests. Changing\nthe slope is doable via initiatives to expand the workforce and boost productivity growth. It’s an\nopportunity this country can’t afford to pass up.\n\nThank you, and I welcome your reactions and questions.\n\n-10-\n\n\fThank you to Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nDionissi Aliprantis and Mark E.

Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nWest Virginia Economic Outlook Conference\nCharleston, West Virginia\nOctober 3, 2018\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you this morning. Since I joined the Fed in January, I’ve\nbeen traveling throughout our district to talk with the people who live and work here. This is my\nfirst trip to Charleston, and my goal is to be interesting enough that you’ll invite me back!\nI came to Richmond after a 30-year career in consulting at McKinsey, where I served as chief\nfinancial officer, chief risk officer and led our offices in the Southeast. I’ve spent my\nprofessional life helping firms make decisions about hiring, compensation and prices, and I’ve\nmade a lot of those decisions myself. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) are some of the most talented macroeconomists, bankers, academics and financial\nregulators in the country. But as the only committee member coming from management, I hope I\ncan bring a different perspective.\nThis morning, I’ll share some of that perspective with you. I’ll start with what I’m seeing in the\neconomy today. But my real focus is the outlook for tomorrow, including some key indicators\nI’m watching. And then I’ll be glad to take your questions. Before I say more, the views I\nexpress are my own and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. 1\nToday\nGDP Growth\nIn the 1970s, economist Arthur Okun invented the Misery Index, the sum of the inflation and\nunemployment rates. At its peak in 1980, the index was almost 22 percent. Today, it’s about 6\npercent — they might want to rename it.\nWhat’s contributing to the economy’s strength? Let’s start with growth. Real GDP grew at about\n2.6 percent last year and topped 4 percent in the second quarter of this year. We won’t know for\na few more weeks if that pace continued in the third quarter, but most estimates put it above 3\npercent. Underlying that growth, in my view, is confidence. Business optimism is high, and the\nUniversity of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment is as high as it’s been since the early\n2000s. We’ve had fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts and the omnibus bill. There’s a sense\nthat we’re in a deregulatory moment. People have jobs, and the markets are strong. Overall, it’s\nstarting to feel like we’ve got some tailwinds rather than headwinds.\nThat said, I’m with the Fed, so I will be cautious. And certainly, trade disputes are making\npeople more nervous than they did a few months ago. In the Michigan Survey, the number of\nhouseholds that mentioned tariff concerns has more than doubled since May. In another survey\n1\n\n\fconducted by the Conference Board, we’re seeing a large gap open up between people’s\nperceptions of today and their expectations for tomorrow. The economy also faces supply chain\nconstraints and the risks of geopolitical instability and market volatility.\nLabor Markets\nAt least for now, though, businesses and consumers seem to be looking through these risks. One\nreason they’re doing so is the strength of the labor market. The economy has added an average of\nmore than 200,000 jobs per month since the start of the year. That’s a very large number; for\nperspective, the “breakeven” to keep up with our country’s population growth is around 80,000 –\n100,000 jobs per month.\nStrong job growth has contributed to unemployment below 4 percent, in the range of our lowest\nlevels since the late 1960s. At the same time, companies still want to hire — at 4.4 percent, the\njob vacancy rate is higher than the unemployment rate and about the highest it’s been since the\nBureau of Labor Statistics started tracking the data in 2000. In short, there are more job openings\nthan there are people looking for work. Vacancies are especially high in fields such as nursing,\nthe skilled trades and truck driving.\nI should note, however, that there are parts of the country still struggling. Here in West Virginia,\nfor example, there are counties where the unemployment rate remains near or even above 8\npercent, and the employment/population ratio is the lowest in the country at around 50 percent.\nThese are real challenges, and it’s important we do not lose sight of them when we talk about the\nstrength of the U.S. economy as a whole.\nInflation and Monetary Policy\nLet’s turn to inflation. We’re coming off a fairly long stretch where inflation ran below the Fed’s\n2 percent target. The numbers have firmed around our target in recent months, but it’s reasonable\nto ask why we’re not seeing more inflation, given the tightness of the labor market, the impact of\ntariffs and commodity cost pressure in places like pulp and oil.\nPart of the answer is that many firms don’t think they can pass on higher costs to consumers.\nThere are a number of reasons for this, including lagging productivity at rates that don’t offset\nwage increases; the buying power of big-box retailers; the price transparency provided by the\ninternet; and competition from lower-priced imports.\nAnother factor keeping inflation in check is that people believe the Fed is going to keep inflation\nin check. The 1970s taught us that inflation expectations play a large role in determining future\ninflation. Currently, multiple measures of inflation expectations are holding steady in line with\nthe Fed’s 2 percent target.\nTomorrow\nNow you might be wondering, how long can this continue? After all, the current economic\nexpansion has been going on for more than nine years — one of the longest upturns on record.\n2\n\n\fWell, I should be humble here: Economists are not the best at predicting the future. (Maybe I\nshould be doubly humble: Guys with 30 years in management aren’t that great at it either.) So\ninstead of telling you what’s going to happen, I’ll tell you about the numbers I’m watching,\nwhich hopefully will be of interest to you as well. Please recognize that when I talk about these\nnumbers, I’m not trying to anticipate shocks, such as a hard Brexit or a political crisis.\nBusiness Investment\nI watch business investment closely. It’s a strong indicator of continued confidence — firms\naren’t going to invest in the future unless they feel good about where we’re headed. This, in my\nview, is the major challenge presented by the discussions we’re having right now about tariffs.\nThey unsettle businesses at a time when strong growth ought to be motivating them to invest.\nInvestment has lagged for the past 10 years. Of course, we had a severe recession, but even\nduring the recovery it’s looked low relative to previous periods and relative to corporate\nprofitability. The last four quarters have been quite strong, however — as we’ve seen here in\nWest Virginia with, for example, the major expansions Toyota and Hino announced last fall.\nSome of that might be catch up; some of it might be those tailwinds I mentioned earlier. Either\nway, we need that confidence to continue for the economy to keep growing at its current rate.\nProductivity\nI’m also paying attention to productivity. That’s because if we want the economy to grow, we\nneed more people to work and/or we need them to be more productive. But the labor force is\ngrowing quite slowly for a variety of reasons, including declining fertility rates, an aging\npopulation and less immigration. This is certainly a challenge facing West Virginia, where the\npopulation has been declining since 2010 and which has the highest ratio of older adults to\nworking-age adults of any state in the Fifth District.\nIf the labor force is growing slowly, then that means economic growth depends on faster\nproductivity growth. But productivity growth also has been slow: Between 2006 and 2017, it\naveraged just 1.3 percent, compared to an average of 2.9 percent between 1995 and 2005. 2 I have\nto confess that I find this challenging to explain because it’s lower than what I think is the\npotential of American businesses. In my professional experience and in my conversations with\ncontacts throughout the district, businesses believe they are driving more productivity than the\ndata suggest, via automation, capital investments and operating efficiencies. Many are.\nIt’s unlikely that the slowdown is simply the result of measurement error, so there must be\nsomething else going on. It’s possible that the past decade of underinvestment has had an impact\non productivity. In addition, economists have found a lot of evidence pointing to decreased\nentrepreneurship. 3 Startups are responsible for a lot of innovation, so this could be contributing\nto slower productivity growth overall. Another explanation could be that some businesses are\ngetting more productive, but they’re doing so at the expense of their competitors, thus\ndampening the effect in aggregate.\n\n3\n\n\fProductivity growth was strong in the second quarter of this year, at 2.9 percent. If that marks the\nstart of a sustained upturn due to investments paying off and technology coming to fruition, it\ncould drive long-term healthy growth. If it’s a one-quarter blip and productivity returns to its\nslower trend, it could limit our economy’s potential growth.\nCompensation Growth for Job Stayers\nI’m watching growth in compensation. As I mentioned, the labor market is very tight. Yet wage\ninflation has been sluggish, averaging just 2.4 percent since 2015 (although it climbed to 2.9\npercent in August). During previous upswings, wage inflation approached 4 percent. One factor\nrestraining wage growth is that absent faster productivity, companies don’t think they have the\nability to increase prices to compensate for paying higher wages. Another major factor, in my\nview, is that turnover has been relatively low. A high percentage of wage costs goes to the\nretained base, and wages tend to rise more when people change jobs. We typically see faster\nwage increases when companies are competing for each other’s employees. But we’re not really\nseeing that competition yet.\nI see three potential paths for the evolution of the labor market. One possibility is that we find\nways to draw more people into the labor force. Although the decline in labor force participation\nover the past two decades is largely the result of demographic changes, there are large gaps by\ngeography, race, gender and education. 4 If we can address these gaps and more people come off\nthe sidelines, we would likely see continued economic growth combined with moderate wage\ngrowth. West Virginia is a state where the opportunities are huge.\nThe second possibility is that we see more of the same: The labor market remains tight but\ncompanies are unable to pass on wage increases so they accept supply constraints instead. In this\nscenario, wage growth is moderate and job growth eventually falls.\nThe third path is that companies decide they need to hire from their competitors. Turnover\nincreases, and companies start paying their current employees more to retain them. That could\ndrive faster inflation. For this reason, compensation growth for job stayers will be a number I’m\nwatching closely.\nConsumer Durables Prices\nI pay attention to prices for durable consumer goods, such as cars and refrigerators. Their prices\nare a key indicator of core inflation. Until around 1995, the price indices for durables,\nnondurables and services increased in tandem. But since then, prices for durable goods have\ndeclined while prices for nondurables and services have continued to increase.\nAs I noted, the internet and big-box retailers have likely been holding prices down, which has\nboth benefited consumers and restrained inflation. But as consumer goods companies’ margins\ncontinue to be squeezed due to increasing pressure from commodity costs and tariffs, they may\nhave no choice but to try to raise prices. We’ve already seen reports of price increases at some\nprominent consumer products firms. If these and future efforts are successful, inflation might\nwell pick up pace.\n4\n\n\fYield Curve\nThe final indicator I’m watching closely is the yield curve, which is the difference between\nshort-term and long-term interest rates. When these rates are close together, it could suggest\nmarkets are losing confidence in the outlook. Currently, many people are concerned about the\ncompression of the spread between 2-year and-10 year Treasuries. Their concern may well be\nwarranted, since an inversion of this yield curve has predicted seven of the last six recessions.\nI respect the 2-year/10-year spread as a signal. That said, I’m not inherently inclined to blindly\nfollow the market’s lead, so I’ve been digging into the research. The Board of Governors, for\nexample, recently published an article suggesting that nearer-term spreads have a better\nforecasting record than the traditional 2-year/10-year measure. 5 These have remained more\nstable and don’t show an elevated risk of recession at present.\nOf course, these market reads are complicated by our own large holdings of Treasuries, the\ndesire of foreign governments for safe assets and recent increases in Treasury purchases driven\nby our increasing deficit. Still, the yield curve is worth watching as well.\nConclusion\nNet, I’m watching five signals: business investment, productivity, compensation for job stayers,\nconsumer durables prices and the yield curve. While forecasting the future evolution of these\nsignals is challenging, I do want to leave you with the thought that the economy’s pulse, as we sit\nhere today, is strong. Growth is solid, unemployment is low and inflation is at target. The\nchallenge is not so much today, but rather ensuring that growth continues. I hope you’ll monitor\nthese five metrics with me over the next year as the Fed tries to do its part to support the\ncountry’s economic growth. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n\n1\n\nThank you to Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nBased on real output per hour in the nonfarm business sector.\n3\nFor example, see Ryan A.

            "content": "Crossing the Geographic Divide\nThomas I. Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nReinventing Our Communities\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Baltimore Branch\nOctober 2, 2018\n\nThank you for inviting me to talk with you today, and thank you to the many members of our\nBaltimore Board of Directors and Community Investment Council who have taken the time to\njoin us as well. I’m sure you’re all looking forward to hearing from director Mary Ann Scully, a\npanelist in the “Women and Wealth Building” workshop later this afternoon.\nThis conference addresses issues that have been of interest to me for a long time and have taken\non a particular urgency for me since I joined the Fed. You may have heard of the economist\nRobert Lucas, who won the Nobel Prize in 1995. Several decades ago, in an article about\neconomic development, he wrote, “The consequences for human welfare involved in questions\nlike these are simply staggering: Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about\nanything else.” He was right. I’ve spent the past nine months traveling around the Fifth District,\nand I’ve been struck by the tremendous diversity in our communities and by the diversity of the\nchallenges and opportunities facing these communities. The more I learn about our district, the\nmore I want to understand why some areas are thriving while others are struggling — and what\ncan be done to help everyone.\nOur upcoming panel has a lot of experts on that topic. I thought I might set up their conversation\nin the context of the macroeconomy. Before I say more, the views I express are my own and\nmight not be shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC). 1\nGrowing the Workforce\nThe FOMC met last week and reviewed a pretty healthy economy: GDP growth is strong,\ninflation is moderate and the unemployment rate is as low as it’s been since the late 1960s.\nWe’ve been adding an average of more than 200,000 jobs per month for more than five years.\nThat’s a very large number when the “breakeven” needed to keep up with population growth is\naround 80,000 to 100,000 jobs per month. There are actually more job vacancies than there are\npeople looking for jobs.\nOne question many people have is, how long can this kind of growth last? To try to answer that\nquestion, let’s look at what drives growth, which you can boil down to a pretty simple statement:\nEconomic growth depends on how many people are working and how productive they are. Right\nnow, productivity growth is fairly slow. So absent a productivity surge, future growth will\nrequire increasing our labor force. But our population is also growing slowly — which means the\ngrowth in our labor force will have to come from people currently on the sidelines of the labor\nmarket.\n1\n\n\fThere are a lot of people on the sidelines. The labor force participation rate (which includes\npeople working or actively looking for work) has dropped about 4.5 percentage points since\n2000, from a little over 67 percent to less than 63 percent. That might not sound like a lot, but it\nis a really big number to the people who study this kind of thing. So while the unemployment\nrate has dropped about 6 percentage points since its Great Recession-era peak, the employmentpopulation ratio has barely budged and is still below pre-recession levels.\nHow likely are people who have left the labor force to return? Much of the drop in labor force\nparticipation is the result of demographics, such as baby boomers retiring and more young\npeople attending college. If we look at the labor force participation rate for what we call “primeage” workers, aged 25-54, it is much higher, around 82 percent, and is only 2 percentage points\nlower than in 2000. That suggests many of the people on the sidelines intend to remain there.\nSo what can we do? We’re unlikely to force retirees back into the workforce, and we want our\nstudents to finish school. But there are large disparities between groups of people of prime\nworking age across a variety of dimensions, including education, race, gender and geography.\nGrowing the labor force requires improving employment outcomes for these groups. I believe\nit’s the biggest opportunity for the growth of our economy.\nUrban, Inner City and Rural Divides\nGiven the themes of this conference, I’ll focus today on geographic differences. One thing that’s\nstruck me is the stark difference between the opportunities available to people in urban areas and\npeople in rural areas. It’s remarkable how quickly, and how much, things change as you leave\nthe city.\nI see it as I travel throughout the Fifth District, and I see it in the data. Across the district as a\nwhole, the employment-population ratio and labor force participation rates are about 6\npercentage points higher in urban than in rural areas. (Both those numbers are calculated for\npeople between the ages of 16 and 64, so the difference doesn’t just reflect that rural populations\ntend to be older.) Interestingly, Maryland is an exception — it’s the only state in the district\nwhere these measures are about the same. That probably reflects the state’s size, which puts rural\nareas in closer proximity to urban areas than in other states.\nThere are a number of factors to untangle about why this divide exists, and it’s something the\nRichmond Fed has begun studying in depth. But in many cases, it’s because the jobs that\ntraditionally supported these communities have moved, and the people (often understandably)\nhaven’t.\nWhile broadly speaking, labor market outcomes are better in urban areas than in rural areas,\nthat’s not true for every part of an urban area: There are divides within cities as well. In this,\nunfortunately, Maryland is not an exception. Here in Baltimore, at the same time new shops and\nrestaurants are being built on Pratt Street and luxury apartment towers are rising on Light Street,\nthere are parts of the city where people can’t find jobs and row houses sit vacant.\n\n2\n\n\fThis is a topic our Bank has been actively studying for several years. For example, we are\ncurrently in the midst of an extensive research project, focused on Baltimore, to understand how\nsome individuals are able to move out of intergenerational poverty. 2 And last year, we brought\ntogether some of the leading researchers in urban economics for a conference here. I wish I could\ntell you we’d found a silver bullet, but as you know the challenges and solutions are complex.\nWe have to keep searching for the answers, because the size of the opportunity is significant.\nAreas with higher employment rates tend to have lower poverty and crime rates and fewer\nchallenges with substance abuse. And on the national level, increasing our labor force is an\nimportant opportunity to support continued economic growth.\nWorkforce Development and Mobility\nWhile there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, I do think there are some common themes; in\nparticular, workforce development and mobility.\nI mentioned that there are currently more open jobs than there are people looking for jobs — and\nI’ve lost count of how many “now hiring” signs I’ve seen outside retail stores and on highway\nbillboards. So why aren’t people in inner cities and rural areas filling these jobs? Part of the\nanswer seems to be a mismatch between the skills employers are seeking and the ones people\nhave. I have heard from a number of my contacts in the district that they’ve having trouble\nfinding skilled workers.\nOne qualification many employers are looking for is a four-year college degree. But students\nfrom rural areas are less likely to attend college than students from suburban areas. Economists\nat the University of Virginia, for example, studied outcomes in that state and found that college\nattendance ranges from less than 50 percent of high school graduates in some low-income,\npredominantly rural school districts to more than 80 percent in some high-income, suburban\nschool districts. 3 Students who grow up in the inner city also are less likely to attend college than\ntheir suburban peers — perhaps because they are significantly less likely to graduate from high\nschool.\nGetting kids to enroll in college is just part of the challenge; roughly 40 percent of college\nattendees fail to earn a degree within six years. These students may be left with significant debt\nand few benefits. So we also need to look at preparing students to succeed in college. That\npreparation begins very early in life, before a child even enters kindergarten, and continues\nthrough high school.\nOf course, there are well-paying jobs that don’t require a four-year college degree, and there are\nstudents for whom a four-year college just isn’t the right fit. Preparation at the K-12 level needs\nto include informing students about those opportunities and about how they can train for them,\nfor example at community colleges or via apprenticeship programs.\nAll that said, it doesn’t do much good to train people for jobs that don’t exist, so we need to look\nat the demand side as well. It can be challenging to lure employers to some rural and inner-city\n\n3\n\n\fareas, but workforce development can help by creating the skilled workers potential employers\nare looking for.\nMobility is another challenge in both rural and inner-city areas: Even if there are jobs, it can be\ndifficult for people to get to them. Rural areas lack public transportation, and in cities, you might\nhave to transfer buses three times. This is a topic outside the purview of a central bank per se, but\nour community development team has convened several symposia devoted to the topic.\nConclusion\nThe challenges are huge but so are the opportunities. If we want to our economy to continue to\ngrow, we need to find ways to address the obstacles many people face to joining the labor force.\nBy doing so, we also can address the poverty and associated ills that afflict far too many of our\nneighbors. The Richmond Bank is digging deeply into the issues and welcomes any thoughts you\nhave on possible solutions. And now, I look forward to hearing the thoughts of our panel.\n1\n\nThank you to Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nFor more on community development efforts in Baltimore, see Jeanne Milliken Bonds, Anne Burnett and Emma\nSissman, “Community Finance in East Baltimore: a Study of Phase One Redevelopment and Financing,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Community Practice Paper #3, 2018.\n3\nSee Emily Cook, Jessie Romero, and Sarah Turner, “Transitioning from High School to\nCollege: Differences across Virginia,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Brief no. 17-12, December\n2017.\n2\n\n4\n\n\f",

Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nBanking and the Economy: A Forum for Minorities in Banking\nSeptember 28, 2018\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nThank you very much for inviting me to talk with you today. Diversity is a major priority for us\nat the Richmond Fed and throughout the Federal Reserve System. And it’s important for us to\nthink about diversity not only in the context of our own workforce and supplier base, but also in\nthe financial industry more broadly.\nIn many ways, the disparities we see at the management level — which I’m looking forward to\nhearing Daniel Garcia-Diaz discuss in our next session — have their roots very early, in the\nopportunities available to people even as young children. Today I’d like to talk about those\ndisparities and put them in the context of the macroeconomy. I’ll talk particularly about human\ncapital, which plays a critical role in labor market outcomes. Before I say more, the views I\nexpress are my own and might not be shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or\non the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).1\nGrowing the Labor Force\nThe FOMC met this week and reviewed a pretty healthy economy. Growth is strong. Inflation is\nmoderate, and the unemployment rate is as low as it’s been since the late 1960s. We’ve been\nadding an average of more than 200,000 jobs per month for over five years, which is a very large\nnumber when the “breakeven” to keep up with population growth is around 80,000-100,000 jobs\nper month. There are actually more job openings than there are people looking for jobs.\nOne question many people have is, how long can this kind of growth last? Economic growth\ndepends on how many people are working and how productive they are. But currently, our labor\nforce is growing quite slowly due to declining fertility rates, an aging population and declining\nimmigration. None of these seem likely to change in the near term. At the same time,\nproductivity growth has been relatively slow. Absent a major productivity surge, then, our\ngrowth depends on whether there are still a lot of people on the sidelines who can be drawn into\nthe labor force.\nThere are definitely a lot of people on the sidelines. The labor force participation rate has\ndropped about 4.5 percentage points since 2000, from a little over 67 percent to less than 63\npercent. That might not sound like a lot, but it is a really big number to the people who study this\nkind of thing. That means that while the unemployment rate has dropped about 6 percentage\npoints since its Great Recession-era peak, the employment-population ratio has barely budged\nand is still below pre-recession levels.\nBut that doesn’t tell us everything we need to know about how deep the labor market’s bench is\n— we also need to consider how likely those people are to return to the labor force. Much of the\n1\n\n\fdrop is due to demographics, such as baby boomers retiring and more young people attending\ncollege. If we look at the labor force participation rate for so-called “prime-age” workers,\nbetween 25 and 54, the labor force participation rate is much higher, around 82 percent, and is\nonly 2 percentage points lower than it was in 2000. This suggests that the people most likely to\nbe in the labor force are already in the labor force.\nSo what can we do to bring people off the sidelines? We’re unlikely to force retirees back into\nthe workforce, and we want kids to go to school. But there are large disparities between groups\nof people of prime working age across a variety of dimensions, particularly education, which in\nturn is correlated with various measures of socioeconomic status, as well as with race and\nethnicity. Education gives us an opportunity to boost labor force participation and improve\nemployment outcomes for these groups. In my view, it’s the biggest opportunity for the growth\nof our economy.\nThe Education Gap\nBeginning around 1980, having a college degree emerged as one of the great dividing lines in\nour economy. College-educated workers earn about 80 percent more than workers with only a\nhigh school degree. They’re also less likely to be unemployed and are less affected by swings in\nthe business cycle. Following the Great Recession, for example, the unemployment rate for\ncollege-educated workers barely topped 5 percent; for workers with only a high school diploma,\nit peaked at 11 percent. Currently, the unemployment rate for workers with at least a four-year\ndegree is 2.3 percent, while it’s 4 percent for workers with only a high school diploma.\nGranted, 4 percent is still a pretty low number. But it has to be weighed against the number of\npeople with only a high school degree who have stopped looking for work: The labor force\nparticipation rate for this group is less than 58 percent, compared to 74 percent for college\ngraduates. Putting together unemployment and participation, the employment/population ratio\nfor workers who only completed high school is 55 percent. It’s more than 72 percent for college\ngraduates.\nCollege enrollment has increased significantly since the 1980s. But roughly 40 percent of\nstudents who enroll don’t graduate within six years — and they often leave with significant debt\nloads and without the benefits a degree offers. Both enrollment and completion are tied to\nsocioeconomic status: Children from lower-income families and children who attend schools\nwith a higher proportion of lower-income students are less likely to attend college and less likely\nto leave with a degree. For example, one study found a gap of nearly 30 percentage points in\ncompletion rates for students from low-income versus high-income families.2 We also see\nvariation by race and ethnicity, particularly when it comes to graduation rates. Black and\nHispanic students are as much as 20 percentage points less likely to complete a degree than white\nand Asian students.\nLet’s dig in deeper — why is socioeconomic status tied to college achievement? It’s not as\nsimple as not being able to afford to go, although that is certainly an obstacle for some students.\nWe also see wealth and income interact with how prepared students are for college. College is a\nrisky investment, so, for example, a student from a low-wealth household who doesn’t think he\n2\n\n\fhas a great chance of graduating might decide, quite rationally, to not enroll in the first place.3\nSimilarly, a student from a lower-income family who learns after several semesters that she\ndoesn’t have the necessary skills might be more prone to drop out than a similarly skilled student\nwith more family resources.4\nWe also know that socioeconomic status is tied to the opportunities students have to obtain those\nskills in the first place, beginning with access to high-quality early childhood education and\ncontinuing on through K-12. Finally, income is linked to how much “knowledge about college”\nstudents have, such as navigating the application process, taking entrance exams, and applying\nfor financial aid. In part, this could be because students from lower-income backgrounds know\nfewer adults who have completed college. It also could be because they attend high schools with\nfewer resources for college guidance.\nOne avenue for policymakers is looking at how to reduce these differences in access and\npreparation during the elementary and high school years.5 Schools can also look at how to help\ntheir attendees graduate; for example, mentorship programs such as the one offered at the online\nWestern Governors University, which has an 80 percent graduation rate, can be very effective.\nCollege Isn’t the Only Option\nI’ve spent the last few minutes emphasizing the benefits of a college education. But for some\npeople, a four-year college just isn’t the right fit. And at present, as I mentioned, there are\nactually more job openings than there are people looking for work — and many of those\nopenings are for well-paying jobs that don’t require a college degree. Health care workers, airline\nmechanics, truck drivers, and skilled tradespeople, for example, are all in high demand right\nnow.\nThus, part of preparation at the K-12 level should be informing students about those\nopportunities and about how they can train for them, for example, at community colleges or via\napprenticeship programs. This could help students improve their prospects relative to quitting\ntheir labor market preparation after high school, which they might do if they think a four-year\nschool is their only postsecondary option, or by enrolling in and then dropping out of a four-year\ncollege.\nConclusion\nThe challenges are huge and the stakes are high, both for individuals and for our ability to\ndevelop the workforce we need. If we want to increase the diversity of our corner offices and\nboardrooms — and build a pipeline of diverse candidates for these offices — we need to address\nthe disparities that exist well before the job interview. This is also one of our best opportunities\nto ensure our economy’s continued growth.\nThe size of the opportunity is significant. If we could bring the employment/population ratio of\nthose with only a high school degree up to the ratio of college graduates, for example, we would\nhave roughly 11 million more people at work. That’s a lot of people contributing to our country’s\neconomic growth.\n3\n\n\fThe Richmond Fed is digging deeply into the issues and welcomes any thoughts you have on\npossible solutions.

Barkin\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nHotel Roanoke, Washington Lecture Hall\nRoanoke, Virginia\nAugust 8, 2018\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you this morning. Since I joined the\nFed in January, I’ve been traveling throughout our district, which extends\nfrom Maryland to South Carolina and also includes most of West Virginia, to\ntalk with the people who live and work here. This is my first trip to the\nRoanoke Valley, and I look forward to coming back.\n\nI came to Richmond after a 30-year career in consulting at McKinsey, where\nI served as chief financial officer, chief risk officer and led our offices in the\nSoutheast. So while I’m new to “economics” in the sense that I don’t have a\nPh.D., I’m not new to the economy. I’ve spent my professional life helping\nfirms make decisions about hiring, compensation and prices, and I’ve made a\nlot of those decisions myself. (I’m also not new to the Fed; I served on the\nAtlanta Fed’s board from 2009 to 2014, including two years as chair.)\n\n1\n\n\fMy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are some of\nthe most talented macroeconomists, bankers, academics and financial\nregulators in the country. But as the only committee member coming from\nmanagement, I hope I can bring a different perspective. This morning, I’ll\nshare some of that perspective with you. I’ll start with what I’m seeing in the\neconomy today. Then I’ll look forward to tomorrow, including some key\nquestions I’m wrestling with. And then I’ll be glad to take your questions.\n\nBefore I say more, I have to note that the views I express are my own and\ndon’t represent those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nToday\nGDP Growth\n\nIn the 1970s, economist Arthur Okun invented the Misery Index, the sum of\nthe inflation and unemployment rates. At its peak in 1980, the index was\nalmost 22 percent. Today, it’s about 6 percent. The economy is strong.\n\n2\n\n\fWhat’s contributing to that? Let’s start with growth. Real GDP grew at about\n2.6 percent last year and topped 4 percent in the second quarter of this year.\nUnderlying that growth, in my view, is confidence. Small business optimism\nis historically high, and the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer\nSentiment is as high as it’s been since the early 2000s. We’ve had fiscal\nstimulus in the form of tax cuts and the omnibus bill. There’s a sense that\nwe’re in a deregulatory moment. People have jobs, and the markets are\nstrong. Overall, it’s starting to feel like we’ve got some tailwinds rather than\nheadwinds.\n\nThat said, I’m with the Fed now, so I have to be cautious. And certainly,\ntariff concerns are making people more nervous than they did a few months\nago. In the Michigan Survey, the number of households that mentioned tariff\nconcerns has more than doubled since May. In another survey conducted by\nthe Conference Board, we’re seeing a large gap open up between people’s\nperceptions of today and their expectations for tomorrow. We’ve also got\nsupply chain constraints, geopolitical instability, market volatility and the\npotential effects of higher interest rates.\n\n3\n\n\fAt least for now, though, businesses and consumers seem to be looking\nthrough these risks. Many people are forecasting growth in the high 2s, or\neven 3 percent, for the remainder of the year.\n\nLabor Markets\nOne reason they’re doing so is the strength of the labor market. The economy\nhas added an average of more than 200,000 jobs per month since the start of\nthe year. That’s a very large number; for perspective, the “breakeven” to keep\nup with our country’s population growth is around 80,000 – 100,000 jobs per\nmonth. Strong job growth has contributed to unemployment below 4 percent,\nin the range of our lowest levels since the late 1960s. At the same time,\ncompanies still want to hire — at 4.3 percent, the job vacancy rate is higher\nthan the unemployment rate and about the highest it’s been since the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics started tracking the data in 2000. Vacancies are especially\nhigh in fields such as nursing, skilled trades and truck driving.\n\nIn short, the labor market is really tight. And we all were taught that when the\nlabor market is tight, companies raise wages. To date, however, wage growth\nhas been modest. Why? One thing I’ve been hearing is that companies don’t\n4\n\n\fthink, from a competitive standpoint, that they can raise prices or capture\nenough productivity to compensate for higher wages. So they’re trying\ndifferent strategies, such as outsourcing and offshoring, retraining existing\nemployees or just delaying filling jobs. Some firms are also expanding their\nhiring pool; for example, I spoke with one firm that’s relaxed its view on\nhiring people with criminal records.\n\nIn addition, until recently, turnover hadn’t escalated significantly, perhaps\nbecause employees were still experiencing a “hangover” from the Great\nRecession that reduced their confidence in switching jobs for a modest pay\nincrease. This is a trend I’m watching closely, because until turnover\nbecomes a consistent issue, businesses are unlikely to give the significant\nacross-the-board wage increases that drive significant moves in overall\nwages.\n\nWe’re also hearing increasingly about businesses finding innovative ways to\ngive workers more nonwage compensation — everything from flexible work\nhours to culture improvement efforts to one contact who has started beer cart\nFridays. (As an aside, beer cart Fridays are often seen as a leading negative\n5\n\n\feconomic indicator.) Of course, these practices aren’t all free, but it’s\npossible employers have found that, at least for now, such benefits are a less\ncostly way than direct compensation to increase employee satisfaction and\nreduce turnover.\n\nInflation and Monetary Policy\nLet’s turn to inflation. We’re coming off a fairly long stretch where inflation\nran below the Fed’s 2 percent target. The numbers have firmed around our\ntarget in recent months, but it’s reasonable to ask why we’re not seeing more\ninflation, given not only the tightness of the labor market, but also\ncommodity cost pressure in places like pulp, steel and oil.\n\nPart of the answer, as I mentioned, is that many firms don’t think they can\npass on higher costs to consumers. There are a number of reasons for this,\nincluding the buying power of big-box retailers, the price transparency\nprovided by the internet and competition from lower-priced imports. Another\nfactor keeping inflation in check is that people believe the Fed is going to\nkeep inflation in check. The 1970s taught us that inflation expectations play a\nlarge role in determining future inflation. Currently, multiple measures of\n6\n\n\finflation expectations are holding steady in line with the Fed’s 2 percent\ntarget.\n\nSo now I imagine you’re wondering, is the FOMC going to keep raising\nrates? And if yes, how far and how fast? I’m not going to tell you — and in\nfact, we don’t know yet, because it will depend on incoming data. But I can\ntell you about the underlying thinking.\n\nThe case for further gradual rate increases goes like this: Although the\nFOMC has begun raising interest rates, they are not yet back to normal levels.\nIt is difficult to argue that lower than normal rates are appropriate when\nunemployment is low and inflation is effectively at the Fed’s target. In\naddition, we don’t want to risk the credibility of our commitment to low and\nstable inflation. That means when the economy calls for moving back to\nnormal levels, as do the conditions I just described, we should follow\nthrough. Given the strength of the underlying economy and the recent\nadditional fiscal stimulus, the risk of normalization is reduced. How high\nrates will ultimately need to rise depends on economic growth: The higher\n\n7\n\n\fthe underlying growth prospects, the higher the policy rate — which brings\nme to the topic of tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow\nIn my former life as a consultant, it was my job to find opportunities for\nimprovement. So let me do a bit of that now. Despite the fairly rosy picture I\njust painted, I’m concerned about our economy’s ability to keep growing.\nThat’s because the math of growth is pretty simple: We need more people to\nwork, and/or we need them to be more productive.\n\nThe Labor Force and Productivity\nThe first thing to look at, then, is the labor force — and if current trends\ncontinue, it’s going to grow slowly. Population growth has been slow, around\n0.7 percent per year, and the Census Bureau projects it will slow even more\nin the future. (It’s not just us; fertility rates have fallen in nearly every\ndeveloped country.) In addition, since the 1990s, immigration has contributed\nabout half of the growth in the working-age population. But that seems\nunlikely to continue in the present environment. Also, labor force\nparticipation (percent working or looking for work) has been trending down,\n8\n\n\fand it’s projected to fall further as my generation retires. Our Richmond team\nestimates a 2 percentage point drop over the next five years based on\ndemographics alone. It’s a challenge facing the greater Roanoke Valley: For\nevery 100 people of working age in the area, there are 31 people of retirement\nage or older. That’s in contrast to Richmond, where there are 24 per 100\nworking-age people. (To be clear, my recent retirement from McKinsey isn’t\nincluded in the Richmond numbers.)\n\nSo labor force growth requires tackling the many labor segments operating\nunder their full potential. For example, there’s a large divide between urban\nand rural areas; here in Virginia the employment-to-population ratio among\nworking-age adults is about six points higher in urban areas than in rural\nareas. People in rural areas often don’t have the same opportunities as people\nin urban areas. I’ve seen it as I’ve traveled around the district, including\ndriving here today; it’s striking how quickly things change as you leave the\ncity. The textbook economics answer would be that people should move to\nthe cities, but there are many valid reasons why people don’t want to, or\ncan’t, relocate.\n\n9\n\n\fAt the same time, there are divides within cities. Roanoke’s downtown\nrevitalization has been remarkable: The city itself is attracting young people,\nthere’s a craft brewery on every corner and new businesses continue to move\nin. At the same time, the poverty rate in the city is 22 percent, well above the\nnational average of 13 percent — clearly, not everyone has been equally able\nto participate in Roanoke’s success.\n\nWe also see a divide by education. Employment rates are much lower for\npeople who don’t have a four-year college degree. But there are well-paying\njobs that don’t require a degree that employers are desperate to fill, such as\ntruck drivers, airline mechanics or skilled trades in construction and\nmanufacturing. There are opportunities to let students know about these jobs\nand help them develop the skills they need to access them.\n\nAnd, finally, after increasing steadily for decades, women’s labor force\nparticipation started to decline around 2000. The United States used to have\none of the highest rates of women’s participation; now we’re in the bottom\nhalf of developed economies.\n\n10\n\n\fGiven slow labor force growth, productivity matters. But a lot of research\nsuggests that productivity growth has declined and that over the past decade\nit’s only grown about half as quickly as the long-term average. The\nRichmond Fed estimates that today it’s around 1.25 percent.\n\nThat’s lower, in my view, than the potential of American businesses. In my\nconversations with businesspeople, they believe they are driving more\nproductivity than the data suggest, via automation, capital investments and\noperating efficiencies. They might be wrong — or it might just take time to\nrealize the benefits of those strategies, as happened in the mid-1990s. It’s also\npossible some businesses are getting more productive at the expense of their\ncompetitors, thus dampening the effect in aggregate.\n\nChallenges for Policymakers\nGrowth matters in and of itself. It also matters for our resilience in the next\ndownturn. As I mentioned, the appropriate policy rate depends on how\nquickly the economy can grow. So in a slow-growth environment, interest\nrates are likely to be lower. This creates some challenges for monetary\npolicymakers, as they have less ability to lower rates to stimulate the\n11\n\n\feconomy in the event of a downturn. 2 As a result, we might at some point\nhave to come back to “unconventional” (and controversial) policies like those\nemployed after the Great Recession. It is not clear how large an impact these\npolicies would have or how well supported they would be.\n\nThe other critical lever in a downturn is fiscal stimulus. But our nation’s\nfiscal capacity is limited. The debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly 80 percent — the\nhighest it’s been since the late 1940s — and the Congressional Budget Office\nprojects it could rise to 100 percent by 2028, depending on whether the recent\ntax cuts are made permanent. For comparison, it was 48 percent in 1994 and\n35 percent in 2007. This fiscal situation challenges our resilience. Will the\ngovernment have enough stimulus available during the next downturn? Will\nthose efforts be offset by investors requiring a higher yield on our debt?\n\nPolicies to Promote Growth\nGiven these challenges, I’m concerned about monetary and fiscal\npolicymakers’ capabilities to provide an effective backstop in the next\nrecession. But stronger underlying growth would address this concern.\nStronger growth would allow the FOMC to raise rates higher without\n12\n\n\fconstraining the economy, giving us more ammunition when we need it.\nStronger growth would create revenues to reduce our deficit, giving us more\ncapacity for fiscal stimulus. Stronger growth would help to lessen the pain\nthat many people in our communities are feeling.\n\nCreating growth is easier said than done, of course, and I won’t presume to\nhave all the answers. And I should point out that monetary policy has a\nlimited effect on the factors that ultimately determine long-run growth. But I\ncan share what I think are important themes.\n\nEducation and workforce development are critical. If we expect the labor\nforce to grow slowly, that means our country has to do a stellar job educating\nand training the workers we already have. In part, that means ensuring\nstudents who want to attend college receive the preparation they need to be\nsuccessful, because far too many students do not. 3 Roughly 40 percent of\nstudents who enroll in a four-year college don’t graduate within six years,\nand many of those who leave without a degree are still left with significant\ndebt. It also means ensuring that young people have viable alternatives other\nthan four-year colleges and that they’re aware of those alternatives. 4\n13\n\n\fThere might be other levers policymakers can pull to increase the labor force,\nsuch as providing more opportunities to rural and inner-city communities.\nThat includes creating jobs in both places as well as investing in initiatives\nthat enable people to travel to, or live near, the jobs. As a country, we can\nlook at ways to support women’s participation in the workforce, such as\ngreater availability of child care and paid leave, 5 and to admit more legal\nimmigrants, who bring with them much-needed skills and entrepreneurial\nenergy. Policymakers might also look at how to continue investing in\ndelivering productivity and in incentive strategies that drive such\ninvestments. For example, although business investment has grown rapidly\nover the past four quarters, it’s still low as a share of GDP relative to\nprevious expansions. And, of course, we should all support efforts to\nresponsibly address our nation’s fiscal situation.\n\nI do want to leave you with the thought that the economy’s pulse, as we sit\nhere today, is strong. Growth is solid, unemployment is low and inflation is at\ntarget. The challenge isn’t so much today, but rather unlocking the sustained\n\n14\n\n\fgrowth that will make the country healthier and more resilient tomorrow.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\n1\n\nThank you to Jessie Romero for assistance preparing these remarks.\nSee John C.

            "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Mark L Mullinix / 2018\n\nBlack Communities Conference\nDurham, N.C.\nGood afternoon. I’m pleased to be here with so many leaders and thinkers from\nthroughout our community. It’s not often that Federal Reserve o�cials get to share a stage\nwith artists and religious leaders and historians and public health experts, to name just a\nfew of the many disciplines represented here.\nIn fact, I’d posit that it’s not often a crowd this intellectually diverse gets together, period —\nwhich is a testament to both the importance and the complexity of the challenges and\nopportunities we’re discussing.\nBefore I say any more, I have to note that my remarks represent my own views and not\nnecessarily the views of the Richmond Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\nIn a few minutes, you’ll be hearing from some of the Fed’s community development team\nabout our e�orts in workforce development. This might prompt you to ask two questions:\nWhy does the central bank have a community development function? And why is the\ncentral bank interested in workforce development?\n\nThe answer to the �rst question can be traced back to 1977 and the passage of the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. This law was intended to discourage “redlining,” or the\nreluctance of many banks to market their products in certain (often minority)\nneighborhoods. More precisely, it encouraged banks “to help meet the credit needs of local\ncommunities in which they are chartered.” (Most people attribute the term “redlining” to\ncolor-coded maps produced by the Home Owners Loan Corporation in the 1930s, which\ndeemed certain neighborhoods “hazardous” for mortgage lenders.)\nThe CRA set up a process to enable citizens and community groups to protest if they\nbelieved a bank was discriminating against a particular neighborhood. Some Reserve Banks\ncreated departments to help those groups navigate the administrative process of �ling a\n\n\fprotest. The Board of Governors asked every regional Reserve Bank to establish a similar\nfunction, and by 1981, community development had a presence throughout the System.\nOver time, community groups needed less assistance with the protest process.\nConcurrently, banks and community groups were increasingly seeking each other out:\nbanks were looking for community investment opportunities, and community groups were\nlooking for funding. So the Fed’s community development function evolved, and we shifted\ninto more of a facilitator role — bringing together community groups, �nancial institutions\nand other stakeholders to provide people and businesses in low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods with tools and resources to address credit and development issues.\nFor nearly three decades, then, understanding the constraints and the opportunities in\ncommunities throughout our District has been part of our mandate.\n\nAnother major component of our mandate, of course, is the charge to promote “maximum\nsustainable employment.” Employment is in�uenced by a variety of factors outside the\npurview of monetary policy, including the education and training of the workforce.\nFor example, during economic downturns and expansions alike, college graduates on\naverage have much lower unemployment rates than workers with less formal education.\nAnd during recessions, the unemployment rate for college graduates tends to rise less than\nthe rate for less-educated workers. Thus, a well-educated workforce may o�er the promise\nof an economy with a low and stable unemployment rate.\nNow, it’s not news to this audience that many communities don’t have equal access to\neducational and work opportunities. And that matters not only for the well-being of the\nindividuals who live in those communities, but also for the well-being of our society as a\nwhole.\nI’ll refrain from going into too much detail, but in short, economists generally believe that\nproductivity growth is the key contributor to long-run economic growth. And the key to\nproductivity growth, in turn, is our society’s “human capital” — the skills and knowledge we\ncollectively possess.\nSo to the extent that some people are not able to reach their full potential simply because\nthey don’t have the same opportunities as others, we are in essence throwing away human\ncapital that could be contributing to more economic growth and higher living standards for\nall of us. And as a policymaker, that is what I am ultimately concerned with.\nDay-to-day, the Fed’s mission is to foster the stability, integrity and e�ciency of our nation’s\nmonetary, �nancial and payments systems. But the reason that’s our mission is because we\nwant to help create a society in which people have the freedom and the opportunity to\nprosper.\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n\fHornstein, Krussell and Violante (2007).\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

            "content": "Advancing Our Understanding of Urban Economics\nMark L. Mullinix\nInterim President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n“Cities in Transition” Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nBaltimore, Maryland\nNovember 3, 2017\n\nGood afternoon. We’re pleased you have joined us to hear firsthand about some of the most\ninteresting and relevant research being done in the field of urban and regional economics. All of\nus at the Richmond Fed hope this is just one of many opportunities we’ll have to collaborate and\nexchange ideas.\n\nBefore I share any of my own ideas, I should note that the views I express today are my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or any other member of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.1\nWhy is the Richmond Fed interested in urban economics? In a sense, the answer can be traced\nback to 1977 and the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). This law was\nintended to discourage “redlining,” or, more precisely, to encourage banks “to help meet the\ncredit needs of local communities in which they are chartered.” The CRA set up a process by\nwhich citizens and community groups could protest if they believed a bank was discriminating\nagainst a particular neighborhood. Initially, community groups needed help navigating the\nadministrative process of filing a protest, so some Reserve Banks set up functions to provide that\nhelp. The Board of Governors asked every regional Reserve Bank to establish a similar function,\nand by 1981, community development had a presence throughout the System.\n1\n\n\fThis presence has evolved over the years. As community groups became more skilled at\nnavigating the protest process, they needed less assistance doing so. At the same time, banks and\ncommunity groups were increasingly seeking each other out: banks were looking for community\ninvestment opportunities, and community groups were looking for funding. So we shifted into\nmore of a facilitator role — bringing together community groups, financial institutions and other\nstakeholders to provide people and businesses in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods with\ntools and resources to address credit and development issues.\n\nFor nearly three decades, then, understanding the constraints and the opportunities in\ncommunities throughout our district has been part of our mandate. More recently, here in\nRichmond we have been expanding on that mandate by investing the resources of our research\ndepartment in studying urban areas specifically.\n\nAs you all know, most economic activity takes place in cities. In our district, which includes\nVirginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., the Carolinas and most of West Virginia, metro areas\ngenerated more than 90 percent of economic output in 2015 and were home to more than threequarters of the population. Just three cities — Baltimore, Charlotte and Richmond, where our\nthree branches are located — account for 20 percent of our district’s population and nearly onequarter of its GDP. As a regional Reserve Bank, we want to understand what contributes to — or\ninhibits — economic vitality in our region, and understanding cities is an important part of the\nequation.\n\n2\n\n\fNot all cities are the same, of course. Our region boasts some of the nation’s most culturally and\neconomically vibrant cities, but we also have cities suffering persistent decline. And even within\nrelatively prosperous or fast-growing cities, there are pockets of deeply entrenched poverty that\npolicymakers have struggled to redress. In recent years, for example, we’ve become tragically\naware of the serious challenges facing many neighborhoods in Baltimore — challenges whose\nroots go back many decades and for which solutions do not seem to be near at hand.\n\nOK, you might be thinking, but why isn’t the Richmond Fed just sticking to monetary policy?\nPart of the answer is that studying our region is essential to conducting monetary policy. For\nexample, what’s happening in one area or one sector might be a harbinger of things to come for\nthe economy as a whole. And national statistics such as the unemployment rate mask significant\ndisparities between people in different areas of the country or different demographic groups. The\nfact that, in October, the economy added 216,000 jobs and the unemployment rate for the nation\nwas 4.1 percent doesn’t mean that rural West Virginians or inner-city Baltimoreans have an easy\ntime finding jobs.\n\nThe other part of the answer is that monetary policy isn’t the right tool to address these\ndisparities. Effective monetary policy creates an environment conducive to economic growth and\njob creation, but it doesn’t affect the many other real variables that influence when and where\neconomic growth occurs — such as a region’s initial endowments of land or natural resources,\ntransportation patterns, changes in technology or even changing tastes in where people want to\nlive. Monetary policy is a blunt instrument — addressing the unique challenges facing Baltimore\nor any other city requires finesse.\n\n3\n\n\fThat’s why your work is so exciting and so important. People in this room today have\ncontributed to developments in urban economics that enable us to model cities in incredibly rich\ndetail and make sure that any counterfactual policy experiment is based on a city’s current,\nspecific reality. I think that’s an incredibly promising direction for economists and policymakers\nto pursue. Of course, I don’t think it’s going to provide us with a silver bullet to solve the\nproblems faced by far too many people in far too many cities across our country — I’m looking\nat a lot of really smart people, and I think if there were a silver bullet, you would have found it\nalready. These are incredibly complex and difficult questions, and the solutions are likely to be\nyears in the making. The Richmond Fed is proud to be playing some role in helping to advance\nthe science, and we are committed to that effort for as many years as it takes.\n\nBefore I let you get back to finishing your lunch — and thank you very much, Dave Beck and\nyour staff here in Baltimore, for providing us with such a good meal — let me emphasize that we\ndo not view our role as coming up with the “right” solutions or prescribing specific solutions to\npolicymakers. Our role is as a convener and a disseminator; we want to bring together the best\nresearchers (including our own economists, of course) and help get that research into the hands\nof policymakers so they can design the most effective solutions for their unique places and\npeople.\n\nThank you again for joining us, and I’m sure you will find the afternoon presentations just as\ninteresting and informative as the ones this morning.\n\n4\n\n\f1\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n5\n\n\f",

Mullinix\nInterim President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nMilitary Officers Association of America, George C. Marshall Chapter\nLexington, Virginia\nOctober 10, 2017\nThank you very much for inviting me to speak with you. It’s an honor to be here, at this storied\ninstitution, and with the MOAA chapter whose namesake remains an inspiration to all who have\nserved.\n\nAlthough I’ve been retired from the Marines for some years now, I try to live up to the Corps’\nvalues of honor, courage and commitment every day, both personally and professionally. I\nappreciate the opportunity to share with you that those values actually align closely with the\nvalues of the Federal Reserve and support our work to foster a healthy, growing economy and a\nstable banking system. I should also say that the economic views I share today are my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Richmond Fed or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nI started my career at the Fed after eight years on active duty as an infantry officer. At first\nglance, the Federal Reserve might not seem like an obvious next career move — after all, what\ndoes a Marine know about monetary policy? But as I’ll share in more detail in a few moments,\nthe Fed is a diverse environment, by which I mean there is much more to the Fed than interest\nrates and inflation. The opportunity to work on multiple missions appealed to me — as did the\ncomfort that the Fed has almost as many acronyms as we do in the military. But most\n\n1\n\n\fimportantly, joining the Fed was a way to continue serving my country, and I see every day how\nthat spirit of service guides my colleagues as well.\n\nThe Fed’s Governance\nBefore I talk about what the Fed does, let me first explain how it’s governed. The Federal\nReserve is a system of 12 independent regional Reserve Banks overseen by a Board of\nGovernors whose members are appointed by the U.S. president and confirmed by the Senate.\nThis structure supports the Fed’s accountability to the public while keeping monetary policy free\nfrom political influence.\n\nEach regional Reserve Bank is governed by a board of nine directors. Six directors are elected by\nmember banks and three are appointed by the Board of Governors in Washington. While some\nmay feel that banks have a lot of influence on our regional board, only three of the bank-elected\ndirectors actually represent banks; the other three represent the public, as do those appointed by\nthe governors. Moreover, those who do represent banks don’t participate in selecting a Reserve\nBank’s president or first vice president.\n\nOur directors do more than oversee the Richmond Fed’s operations; they also are a unique and\ninvaluable source of regional “grassroots” economic data. For example, our directors include the\npresident of a bank not too far down the road in Roanoke; a senior executive at Northrop\nGrumman in Maryland; and the head of a manufacturer in North Carolina. They all have\ndifferent perspectives and insights, which help inform my economic perspectives when I go to\nFOMC meetings.\n\n2\n\n\fMonetary Policy\nThere’s one of those acronyms — the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the Fed’s\nmonetary policymaking body. It’s composed of the seven members of the Board of Governors\n(when the Board is fully staffed; right now, as you may know, we have several openings) and\nfive regional Bank presidents on a rotating basis. (Richmond votes next year). Whether or not a\npresident is voting at any given meeting, he or she participates fully in the FOMC’s discussion\nand has an opportunity to weigh in on any proposed policy actions.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act to specify that the FOMC is\ncharged with promoting maximum employment and stable prices — what you might have heard\nreferred to as the “dual mandate.” I won’t try to explain precisely how the Fed works to achieve\nthose objectives, especially as they have evolved since the financial crisis. But, generally\nspeaking, monetary policy tools influence interest rates, which in turn affect the supply of and\ndemand for money. Put another way, the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions influence the\ndecisions businesses and consumers — you and I — make nearly every day about how much to\nspend and save and invest. And all those billions of individual decisions add up to our economy.\n\nBank Supervision and Regulation\nThe FOMC gets most of the news headlines. But as I mentioned, monetary policy is only part of\nwhat the Fed does. Another core function is bank supervision and regulation. By law, the Fed\nsupervises all bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, state-chartered\nbanks that elect to become members, foreign banks operating in the United States and\n\n3\n\n\f“systemically important financial institutions” (or, here we go again, SIFIs, in Fed parlance). At\nthe Richmond Fed, we supervise some of the largest banks in the country, which have chosen to\nmake their home in the Fifth District. Our goal is to ensure that banks are financially healthy and\nable to meet the needs of their customers and to ensure that banks’ deposit and lending practices\nare fair and access is equitable — a point I’ll come back to in a few minutes.\n\nThe Payments System\nA third core function of the Fed is moving money from point A to point B, referred to as the\nnation’s payments system. Today, a lot of that money is in electronic form. The Fed is the largest\noperator of the automated clearinghouse, or ACH, network; that’s the system that enables direct\ndeposit, online bill payment and many of the other online transactions we’ve come to depend on.\nWe also operate Fedwire, a system for high-dollar interbank settlements, through which more\nthan $4 trillion dollars changes hands each day.\n\nUntil the early 2000s, much of our work also involved moving paper checks between banks; on\nany given weekday, there were about 43,000 pounds of checks in transit. Today, Americans\nwrite a lot fewer checks, and those checks are now processed electronically. The Fed currently\nhas just one check processing center, in Atlanta, compared to 45 centers nationwide in 2003.\n\nAlthough Americans use plastic for a growing share of transactions, cash is still alive and well.\nEvery regional Bank has a cash processing center; between the Richmond Fed’s three sites in\nRichmond, Charlotte and Baltimore, we process between 12 million and 14 million notes per\nday. Part of that process is determining if a note is still fit for circulation. The average $5 bill, for\n\n4\n\n\fexample, has a lifespan of about five years before it becomes too worn for use. Bills that\nshouldn’t go back out for circulation are shredded (and recycled as products such as roofing tiles\nor souvenirs for people who visit the Fed). We also examine every bill to make sure it’s genuine.\nIn Richmond, we detect between 40 and 50 counterfeits each day, which are sent to the Secret\nService for further investigation. (The Fed catches only about 20 percent of the counterfeit notes\npassed in the United States — banks and merchants catch the vast majority of the remainder.)\n\nMost basically, our cash service distributes coin and currency to the banks in their respective\ndistricts. But on a deeper level, this function is essential to the safety and security of our nation’s\ncitizens. When there’s a national emergency or a natural disaster, such as the recent storms that\ndevastated so much of the Gulf region and Puerto Rico, people need to buy food and water and\ndiapers. They need to be able to get cash from their banks when they can’t use their credit cards\nbecause the power is out. Working with the banks and transportation carriers, there are extensive\nbusiness continuity plans to ensure that your financial institutions can meet your needs in the\nevent of an emergency.\n\nCommunity Development\nAs I mentioned, part of our bank supervision role is working to ensure that banks’ lending\npractices are fair and equitable. One major way we do that is by assessing banks’ compliance\nwith the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), a 1977 law intended to discourage the practice of\n“redlining,” or banks’ perceived reluctance to lend in certain (typically poor and minority)\nneighborhoods. In the words of the law, the CRA requires banks to serve the needs of the\ncommunities in which they are chartered to do business, including these low- and moderate-\n\n5\n\n\fincome, or LMI, communities. Such communities are a large part of our District; as of 2014,\nmore than one-quarter of our region’s population, 8.1 million people, lived in LMI\nneighborhoods.\n\nWhen the CRA was first enacted, Reserve Banks played an important role helping community\ngroups navigate the administrative processes of the act. Over time, that role grew into a formal\ncommunity development function that works to provide people and businesses in LMI\ncommunities with tools and connect them with resources to address credit and development\nissues. Just a week or so ago, for example, our Bank brought together a group of medical\nprofessionals, health advocates and financial professionals to discuss health investments in\nVirginia, particularly in hard-to-reach rural areas.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nDuring my time at the Fed, I have learned that even the brightest policymakers, business and\ncommunity leaders don’t have all the answers when it comes to the economy. People, and by\nextension markets, don’t always behave the way economists and policymakers might expect\nthem to. In fact, yesterday a Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to Richard Thaler for his\nresearch on how human traits affect individual decisions and financial markets; put simply, his\nresearch found that humans often don’t act rationally. I’d like to suggest that recognizing that\nfact is one of the Fed’s strengths. And that is one reason the Federal Reserve System has 12\nindependent regional Reserve Banks: so monetary policy benefits from the diverse insights of\nbusiness people, bankers, farmers and nonprofit leaders. And, as I mentioned, from medical\nprofessionals, health advocates and financial professionals, too. Another strength of the Fed is\n\n6\n\n\fthat no one at the table during FOMC meetings presumes to have perfect foresight or knowledge;\neveryone is willing to listen to evidence that might contradict their own prior beliefs or\nunderstanding of the data. The debates can be vigorous, but they are always respectful.\n\nReasonable people can, and have, debated the wisdom and efficacy of the Fed’s past policy\ndecisions. Based on my experience with the Fed, I’ll offer that what’s not debatable is the Fed’s\nunwavering commitment to do our best for the American people in meeting our statutory\nmission. That commitment guides us today during some admittedly uncertain times.\n\nTurning to the current economic landscape, as you probably know the Fed targets 2 percent\ninflation over the long run. You’re also probably aware that inflation has been running somewhat\nbelow that target for several years; as of August, the most recent reading for the past 12 months\nis 1.4 percent.\n\nRelatively weak inflation has been coupled with relatively strong improvements in other\neconomic indicators. The unemployment rate was 4.4 percent in August and has been below 5\npercent for more than a year; job growth has been steady; and other measures of the labor market\nsuggest we’re pretty close to “maximum employment.” GDP growth was a solid 3.1 percent in\nthe second quarter, and while we will probably see some slowdown in the third quarter due to\nHurricanes Harvey and Irma, experience suggests that slowdown will be temporary. Overall,\ntrends in wages, household spending and business investment point to the economy continuing to\nexpand at a moderate pace over the next few years.\n\n7\n\n\fHistorically, lower unemployment rates have been correlated with higher inflation; the basic\neconomic mechanism is that when workers are scarce, employers raise wages, and those higher\ncosts flow to consumers in the form of higher prices. Given how low the unemployment rate is at\npresent, one might conclude that the current stance of monetary policy is too accommodative.\nBut as I mentioned, inflation is actually running below the Fed’s long-run target. One possible\nexplanation, as Chair Yellen noted in her most recent press conference, is that unusual events\nhave lowered specific prices substantially, which has an effect on the overall price level. Since\nthose unusual events are only temporary, inflation is likely to increase in coming months. In\naddition, higher gas prices as a result of the hurricanes will likely boost inflation in the very short\nterm. Overall, the FOMC expects inflation will rise and fluctuate around 2 percent over the next\nfew years, and that additional increases in the federal funds rate will be forthcoming.\n\nThat said, we don’t have a perfect understanding of the current behavior of inflation. Some have\nproposed that the relationship between unemployment and inflation has weakened over time,\nmeaning it takes bigger swings in unemployment to trigger changes in inflation. Demographic\nshifts, such as baby boomers retiring and large numbers of younger workers joining the work\nforce at lower wage rates, could also be a headwind for wage growth and inflation. Competitive\npressure on firms making it difficult to raise prices, the “scarring” of many workers during the\nfinancial crisis resulting in reluctance to demand higher wages, sluggish productivity and\nperhaps lower consumer expectations for inflation are other hypotheses being examined at\npresent.\n\n8\n\n\fWith those factors in mind — but also with the knowledge that monetary policy operates with a\nlag — it will be important to act before inflation gets too far ahead of target. We will be\nwatching the incoming data very closely and gradually adjusting policy to better achieve our\ninflation and employment objectives.\n\nConclusion\nSo, why do we care about achieving those objectives? Beyond the obvious answer — that we\nwant a healthy economy and want people to have jobs so they can buy the goods and services\nthey need — it’s because economic prosperity is essential to ensure our most basic freedoms. As\nGen. Marshall said when he introduced an economic recovery package aptly referred to as the\nMarshall Plan, without “normal economic health…there can be no political stability and no\nassured peace. This Plan is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger,\npoverty, desperation and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the\nworld so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions\ncan exist.”\n\nThe relationship flows both ways. Our national security apparatus creates the environment in\nwhich our citizens feel safe to buy homes, go to school and take entrepreneurial risks. In the\nother direction, military strength flows from economic strength. The United States military is the\nstrongest in the world because we can invest in the people and technology to be the strongest in\nthe world.\n\n9\n\n\fThere’s a classic example in economics known as “guns or butter.” The idea is to illustrate that a\ncountry makes choices about what to produce given its finite resources. The more butter, the\nfewer guns; the more guns, the less butter. But in the real world — in today’s world — it’s not a\nsimple trade-off. Instead, we should think about the situation as, “no guns without butter, and no\nbutter without guns.”\n\nWhile allocating resources to guns versus butter is the purview of fiscal policy, fiscal decisions\nmust be underpinned by a healthy, fully functioning economy. It’s been my distinct pleasure to\ntalk to you today about the Fed’s mission to promote a healthy economy through our work on\nmonetary policy, banking supervision, electronic payments, checks and cash and our role in\ncommunity development and outreach. In short, our job is to serve the American public — to\nserve you.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n10\n\n\f",

            "content": "Inflation Dynamics in Stable and Unstable Policy Regimes:\nComment on “Deflating Inflation Expectations”\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nNew York, New York\nMarch 3, 2017\n\nI’d like to thank the organizers for the opportunity to discuss this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy\nForum paper. 1 It represents a useful sequel to the very first Forum paper, which I discussed 10\nyears ago at the inaugural gathering in 2007. 2 The earlier paper provided a flexible specification\nthat was capable of capturing the changing dynamics of inflation across time and across a\nnumber of countries. In particular, the framework was able to accommodate the significant\ndifference between the behavior of inflation during the 1970s and its behavior during the socalled Great Moderation period, a difference that we often attribute to changes in the monetary\npolicy regime. The current paper finds that a simplified version of that framework suffices to\ncharacterize the dynamics of inflation in the U.S. since 1984 — that is, since the Volcker\ndisinflation.\nFrom the point of view of a monetary policy practitioner, this narrower focus has certain virtues.\nUnderstanding the local dynamics of inflation within the current monetary regime — a regime in\nwhich inflation has been low and relatively stable — is clearly useful for thinking about policy\non a meeting-by-meeting basis, and the authors make a valuable contribution in this regard. But\npolicymakers also need to understand, to the extent possible, the forces that might cause these\ndynamics to shift or drift away toward greater volatility. In my remarks, I’ll comment both on\nhow I think about the behavior of what the authors call “local mean inflation” and on the longerrun question of transitions between more and less stable periods. Now would be a good time to\nemphasize that the views expressed are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues\nin the Federal Reserve System. 3\nThe key output of the author’s empirical exercise is an estimate of what they call the local trend\nrate of inflation, estimated from their univariate model. They find that, given this estimate,\nmeasures of inflation expectations add little to the near-term forecasting ability of the model.\nThis strikes me as a credible result for a period over which monetary policy has fairly\nconsistently achieved low and stable inflation. In such an environment, variations in our\nmeasures of (longer-term) inflation expectations are plausibly attributable at least as much to the\nimperfections in those measures as they are to meaningful variation in actual expectations. At the\nsame time, expectations for near-term inflation seem likely to follow an estimated local trend\npretty closely.\nThey also find that measures of resource slack add little to near-term inflation forecasts. This\nhighlights the extent to which such empirical relationships are likely to be contingent on the\nconduct of monetary policy. The authors interpret this finding as raising doubts about what they\n1\n\n\fcall the “Phillips-curve-centric approach to forecasting inflation.” I share these doubts, and they\nillustrate the broader danger of treating estimated relationships between measures of slack and\ninflation as structural.\nLater in the paper, the authors estimate a related model in which trend inflation is a function of\nlagged actual inflation and consider how alternative future paths for realized inflation would\naffect the movement of their estimated inflation trend toward the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. Given\ntheir specification, getting the trend to 2 percent in finite time requires realized inflation to\novershoot and rise above 2 percent, an algebraic fact they demonstrate with some illustrative\ncalculations. This has the feel of an engineering exercise, and while it is useful for illustrating\nproperties of their estimated inflation process, I’m not sure the authors want us to take it\nseriously as a menu for policymakers. For example, the notion that the Fed would engineer a\nsequence of inflation shocks in order to bring the local trend back to target seems hard to square\nwith the central idea in the paper — that the local trend itself wanders around and is not firmly\ntied to the Fed’s target or to the public’s expectations. Moreover, it’s not obvious that policy\nwould affect trend inflation only through period-by-period inflation realizations.\nThe random-walk feature of the local trend in their main model suggests an inflation process\n(and an expectations process) that is not perfectly anchored, in the sense that the long-run\nforecast of inflation fluctuates over time. The natural question here is how sharply the data can\ndistinguish between this specification and one in which the trend is a very slow-moving but\nmean-reverting process centered around 2 percent. For some purposes, a random walk might be a\nuseful approximation, but these two specifications could have very different policy implications.\nFor example, a mean-reverting trend could converge to target from below without meaningful\novershooting.\nThe bottom line I take from their estimation, though, is that if inflation continues to be\ndetermined as it was over their sample period, we should continue to see similar stability in\ninflation trends. This conclusion is somewhat reassuring, but the comfort it provides is limited by\nthe post-1984 scope of the exercise. Because as much as we’d like to, I don’t think we can take\nthe stability of this period for granted. Rather, it appears to be a consequence of the conduct of\nmonetary policy. Indeed, the relative stability of their estimated local trend strikes me as good\nevidence of the success of the policy regime that has prevailed since the 1980s, and in particular\nsince the early 1990s, a regime in which the Fed has acted pre-emptively against incipient\ninflationary pressures. 4\nPolicymakers have a natural interest in acting in a manner that is consistent with maintaining a\nstable inflation regime. No one policy decision is likely to dislodge the trend dynamics of\ninflation, of course. But as policymakers we need to do a better job, I believe, of understanding\nhow those dynamic transitions out of periods of relative stability occur. The difficulty of doing\nthis is in part evident in the more complex, general specification in the 2007 U.S. Monetary\nPolicy Forum paper. 5 An even greater challenge, I think, comes from the fact that we really have\nonly one observation of a transition away from price stability in the postwar U.S. data — the\nepisode beginning in the mid-1960s. I’d like to take the remainder of my time to look more\nclosely at that episode, because I think it may shed some light on our current situation. 6\n\n2\n\n\fThere are some striking parallels between the monetary policy environments of the mid-1960s\nand today. First, resource utilization was tight and getting tighter. The unemployment rate fell\nfrom 5 ½ percent at the end of 1963 to 4 percent in 1965 and 3.6 percent by the end of 1966.\nAlong the way, there was an active debate about the degree of remaining slack.\nSecond, inflation was low and stable coming into this period, hovering around 1 ½ percent\nthrough the end of 1965, although a number of prominent wage settlements in 1964 and 1965\nexceeded the administration’s guidelines. Inflation then began rising: to 3.1 percent for 1966, 2.6\npercent for 1967, and 4.3 percent for 1968.\nThird, fiscal stimulus was in play throughout the period. The Kennedy tax cut was enacted in\nFebruary 1964, followed in subsequent years by increased spending on Johnson’s Great Society\nprograms. In mid-1965, Johnson announced a military buildup in Vietnam. But he deliberately\nkept the magnitude of the additional spending a secret, although Fed Chairman William\nMcChesney Martin was aware of what was going on from contacts in Congress, at the\nDepartment of Defense, and at defense contractors in his hometown of St. Louis.\nFourth, Chairman Martin faced a hostile political environment, and the tension between\nmonetary and fiscal policy was front and center. Congressional populists such as Wilbur Mills\nand Wright Patman repeatedly threatened restrictive changes to the Federal Reserve Act. And\nPresident Johnson was not shy about scolding the Fed chairman, both in private and in public.\nAs the Kennedy tax cut was being considered at the beginning of 1964, Congress and the White\nHouse were openly opposed to interest rate increases. At hearings in January of that year, Rep.\nReuss accused Martin of wanting to “vitiate” the effects of the tax cut on employment. At the\nsame time, Walter Heller, chair of Johnson’s Council of Economic Advisers, was arguing that\ntight money “could kill off a substantial part of the expansionary economic impact of the tax\ncut.” The Fed did ultimately raise the discount rate on November 24, 1964, by 50 basis points.\nPresident Johnson erupted — the press described him as “unhappy and upset.”\nThe next time the Fed raised the discount rate was December 6, 1965, also by 50 basis points.\nTwo days later, Johnson famously summoned Martin to his Texas ranch, where he was\nrecovering from gallbladder surgery. Johnson upbraided Martin, telling him “You’ve got me in a\nposition where you can run a rapier into me and you’ve done it,” adding, “that’s a despicable\nthing to do.” Martin’s visit included an infamous drive around the ranch at breakneck speeds in\nJohnson’s white Cadillac convertible, with Johnson at the wheel.\nIn early 1966, bank credit soared, real growth surged, and inflation rose to 3 percent. Wanting to\navoid the visibility of a discount rate increase, the Fed embarked on a jawboning campaign to\npersuade banks to limit credit growth, and the Desk brought down free reserves — that is, excess\nreserves minus discount window borrowing. The resulting rise in market rates, together with\nbinding Regulation Q constraints, led to a slowdown in housing activity that caused the Fed to\nback off at the end of 1966 and early 1967. (This also led to Congress granting us authority to\npurchase obligations of the federal housing agencies, and then proceed to pressure us to actually\nmake such purchases, but that’s another story.) 7\n\n3\n\n\fEconomic conditions early in 1966 also led Martin to begin campaigning within the\nadministration for a tax increase in order to provide further policy restraint and help finance the\nwar. LBJ finally signed on at the beginning of 1967 and proposed a tax surcharge in his State of\nthe Union address, but his administration argued for easier monetary policy to offset the\nanticipated contractionary effect. Johnson delayed introducing a bill, however, out of fear that\nCongress would insist on scaling back his Great Society initiatives in exchange. In the end, the\ntax bill was not passed until the spring of 1968, at which point inflation had risen to 4 percent. It\nwas a temporary tax surcharge, however, and did not have the contractionary effect that was\nanticipated at the time, in part because the distinction between permanent and temporary tax\nchanges wasn’t fully appreciated. The Fed then began raising rates more aggressively, but it was\ntoo late.\nYou may have noticed in my narrative the seemingly bizarre coincidence that at beginning of the\ntightening sequence in 1964 and 1965, we raised rates just twice in two years, both times at the\nvery end of the year. The broader parallel is that initial policy tightening moves in the first two\nyears were quite slow, both then and now. Another is the potential for conflicting views of how\nmonetary policy should react to fiscal stimulus in an economy with tight labor markets.\nAnother parallel is that there was uncertainty then, as now, regarding how accommodative the\nstance of policy actually was at any given point. The Committee was often focused on free\nreserves and nominal rather than real interest rates. Both gave off misleading signals in early\n1966. Today, uncertainty about r* and other parameters of the Taylor Rule also make assessing\nthe stance of policy challenging.\nThere are several differences between then and now that ought to give us some comfort that we\ncan avoid the mistakes of the 1960s. Certainly, there have been substantial improvements in the\ntransparency of fiscal policy. It’s hard to imagine a contemporary administration hiding a\ndoubling of war spending from Congress and the secretary of the Treasury for any appreciable\namount of time.\nThe most important difference, though, is that the disastrous inflationary experience of the 1970s\nhas made clear how costly it can be to lose control of inflation and have inflation expectations\nbecome unhinged. This lesson appears to be much more broadly understood now within the\neconomics profession and the central banking world.\nAt the same time, however, some policymakers of the 1960s articulated remarkably modern\nconcerns. In a speech shortly after the December 1965 rate increase, for example, Martin\narticulated a prescient argument for pre-emptive monetary policy:\n[T]he effective time to act against inflationary pressures is when they are in the\ndevelopment stage — before they have become full-blown and the damage has been\ndone…. It is simpler, for one thing, to try to prevent prices from rising than to attempt to\nroll them back. And finally, it is surer and safer: so long as inflation is merely a threat\nrather than a reality, it is enough to prevent the pace of economic expansion from\naccelerating dangerously. But once that pace has become unsustainably fast, then it\nbecomes necessary to reduce the speed, and once such a reduction has started, there is no\n4\n\n\fassurance it can be stopped in time to avoid an actual downswing…. We shall succeed in\navoiding a “stop-and-go” cycle — as the British call the practice of first permitting\ninflationary pressures to develop and then taking drastic measures to suppress them —\nonly if we do not delay until inflation is upon us. 8\nSo Martin, at least, understood the risks in a way that we would find familiar. One hopes that the\nexperience of the 1970s has made this lesson more broadly appreciated than it was in Martin’s\ntime. But Martin’s contemporaneous understanding of the value of pre-emption suggests that the\nproblem may have been less a lack of understanding and more a lack of political will.\nThe political context around price stability and Fed independence may be the most critical\ndifference between the mid-1960s and now. The deference to Fed independence shown by\nadministrations since the early 1990s has set a precedent that seems to have improved the\npolitical dynamic for us in recent years relative to what the record shows for the 1960s and ’70s.\nCertainly there is much more widespread understanding of the extent to which central bank\nindependence, in a context of accountability and transparency, contributes to healthier monetary\npolicy. At the same time, given various legislative proposals that have emerged in the last few\nyears, I think we’d all agree that central bank independence cannot be taken for granted.\nSo what should we make of this historical digression? Are we at risk of losing stability, as we did\nin the 1960s? If you choose to focus on the parallels, you might think so, although the significant\ndifferences could mitigate your concerns. But, turning back to this year’s paper, one might\nwonder what the authors’ empirical exercise would have shown if performed only using data\navailable through the end of 1965. A recent paper by Elmar Mertens reports such one-sided\nestimates. 9 His estimated trends are low and stable until 1966, when they begin rising sharply.\nEstimates of the volatility of the trend are also low before 1966, in many cases close to current\nlevels, and also rise sharply starting in 1966. This confirms the sense one gets from narrative\naccounts of how suddenly stability seemed to have been lost. It also confirms the notion that\ninflation dynamics estimated over a period of relative stability may have only limited\nimplications for the important task of maintaining that stability.\nAgain, this does not tell us how much at risk we are right now. Monetary policy in the 1960s\nmakes for a sobering tale, but I believe we can avoid repeating those mistakes. I look forward to\nthe 20th U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, where I trust we will not be learning more about how\nstability is lost, but rather about how it is preserved.\n1\n\nStephen G.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, February 2017\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThe Lyons Companies and the Lerner College Center\nfor Economic Education and Entrepreneurship\n2017 Economic Forecast\nNewark, Delaware\nFebruary 14, 2017\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you. We are certainly living in interesting times, which makes\nit more challenging than usual to predict what might be in store for the U.S. economy. But I’m\nhappy to prognosticate this morning — especially since I’ll be retired by the time any of my\npredictions can be proven wrong.\nBefore looking ahead, however, I’d like to start by reviewing the recent performance of the\neconomy. As always, the views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. 1\nThe first fact worth noting is that we are in the eighth year of an economic expansion. For\ncomparison, since World War II the average expansion has lasted 4 ¾ years, measured from the\nbottom of the recession to the beginning of the next recessionary contraction. Most forecasters\nforesee continued growth in 2017. One might think this expansion is getting long in the tooth,\nand that as a result we are “due,” so to speak, for a correction. The statistical evidence is pretty\nclear, however, that business cycle expansions do not die of “old age.” What I mean by that is\nthat the probability of a recession in any given time period does not vary with the age of the\nexpansion. 2\nThis expansion, however, has been weaker than past expansions. Real GDP — our broadest\nmeasure of production and incomes — grew at a 2.2 percent average annual rate from the end of\nthe recession through the fourth quarter of 2015. Before the Great Recession, real GDP during\nthe postwar era had increased at about a 3 ½ percent average annual rate, and there were periods\nin which growth was even higher. During the 1960s, for example, real GDP grew at a 4 ½\npercent average annual rate. 3\nThere are good reasons why matching those golden age growth rates on a sustained basis might\nbe a stretch. For one thing, the labor force is expanding much more slowly. During the ’60s, the\nlabor force grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate, driven by a growing population and rising\nparticipation of women in the workforce. But the labor force participation rate of women peaked\nin 1999 and has been declining since then. Moreover, the aging of the baby-boom generation is\ntilting the mix of the working-age population toward age cohorts with lower participation rates.\nAt present, some economists estimate it could take annual employment growth of just around\nsix-tenths of 1 percent (or 60,000 jobs per month) to keep up with the growth in the working-age\npopulation. 4\n\n1\n\n\fAnother reason GDP growth has been lower of late is that productivity has been rising less\nrapidly. Over the last five years, GDP per worker has grown at an annual rate of only ½ of 1\npercent. Before the Great Recession, that measure of productivity increased at a 1 ¾ percent\nrate; during the macroeconomic golden age of the 1960s, that measure gained about 2 ½ percent\nper year. Because real (inflation-adjusted) incomes per worker closely track productivity growth\nover time, the current productivity slowdown is likely to be having a significant effect on\nAmerican households’ attitudes toward the economy and related public policy issues. 5\nIn short, both real GDP and employment appear to be converging to paths governed by\nproductivity and demographic trends. Looking back at 2016, real GDP came in a touch below 2\npercent. Employment growth slowed as well, from 226,000 jobs per month in 2015 to 187,000\njobs per month. But that rate of growth is still unsustainably high — we need less than half that\nrate to keep pace with population trends. The unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in December, a\nrelatively low rate by historical standards. Although the unemployment rate ticked up slightly\nlast month, to 4.8 percent, in general it has continued to decline the past few years. But because\nthe unemployment rate cannot continue to fall forever, employment growth is likely to continue\nto slow in line with population growth.\nStrong (albeit slowing) employment growth has been supporting solid consumer spending.\nInflation-adjusted household expenditures grew by 2.8 percent last year, and real disposable\nincome grew by 2.1 percent. I expect continued strength in consumer spending this year, despite\nslowing job growth, because wage rates have been rising at an increasing pace. Average hourly\nearnings rose by 2.8 percent last year, well above the overall rate of inflation. And tightening\nlabor markets are likely to add to wage pressures this coming year. So even if consumer\nspending growth slows, it’s likely to remain above 2 percent.\nWhile consumer spending boosted overall growth in 2016, surprisingly weak investment was a\ndrag on growth. After a strong start, residential investment hit an unanticipated soft spot in\nmidyear, actually falling in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter.\nThe largest portion of this investment category is single-family home construction, and here the\noutlook is positive. New single-family housing starts rose by about 4 percent last year, household\nformation is rising and household finances are strong. I expect residential investment to make a\nsolid contribution to real GDP growth in 2017.\nBusiness investment also has been unexpectedly sluggish, falling in the last quarter of 2015 and\nthen increasing by only 0.3 percent in 2016. A portion of the weakness was due to sharply lower\noil and natural gas drilling, a natural response to low oil and gas prices. But other business\nequipment spending has disappointed as well, in part due to the strengthening of the dollar on\nforeign exchange markets last year, which intensified competition for many domestic producers\nand resulted in lower output and lower investment plans. The fundamentals for business\ninvestment have remained reasonably sound, however, so I am forecasting solid investment\ngrowth this year.\n\n2\n\n\fTaking on board all the data we’ve seen on spending and labor markets, my forecast is for real\nGDP growth of 2.0 percent for 2017, falling to a long-run trend of around 1 ¾ percent in 2018\nand beyond.\nA year ago, inflation was expected to rise gradually toward 2 percent, and it has done so, perhaps\neven a bit more rapidly than some had anticipated. Recent data have given us no reason to expect\nthat this trend will reverse. If anything, the pickup of inflation could quicken temporarily, given\nrecent increases in oil prices. So I expect inflation to be close to 2 percent this year.\nThe outlook I’ve just described is conditioned on only the flow of hard economic data we’ve\nseen for 2016, together with a small amount of data on economic activity this year. Of course, we\nhave also had an election here in the United States. The results of that election took many\nobservers by surprise and appear to have left a sizable imprint on financial asset prices. While\nthere is considerable uncertainty about how a new administration’s policies might affect the\nnear- and longer-term economic outlook, the nature of financial markets’ response suggests that\ninvestors may be anticipating some combination of tax reductions and increased military and\ninfrastructure spending. Commentators have also suggested that regulatory changes could\ncontribute to an increase in productivity. Concerns have been expressed, however, about the\npotential effects of policies that are less friendly to international trade and migration, and thereby\nimpede growth.\nOn one hand, equity market movements since the election could be the result of a more\noptimistic outlook on the part of business enterprises. On the other hand, equity market\nmovements could be causing more optimism. To the extent that either is true, a more positive\noutlook for business investment would be warranted. If so, the unanticipated softness in capital\nspending last year may have been attributable to a desire to delay irreversible investment\ncommitments until after the election, and a release of pent-up spending plans may be in the\noffing. Still, the investment outlook, and thus financial asset prices, could well fluctuate as\nincoming information alters expectations regarding the medium-term policy environment.\nThe rise in longer-term U.S. interest rates in the month following the election was roughly\nevenly split between real rates and compensation for inflation. Even more striking is the\nmovement in the implied probabilities of very high and very low inflation derived from options\nmarkets. These have flipped from a tilt toward lower inflation being much more likely than high\ninflation to the opposite; inflation above 3 percent is now seen as about twice as likely as\ninflation below 1 percent. In addition, the estimated term premium on 10-year Treasury\nsecurities has moved from negative territory to closer to zero, suggesting that investors see less\nvalue in Treasuries as a hedge against deflation and are becoming more concerned about the\nexposure of the nominal Treasuries to the risk of inflation. These developments could reflect the\ndissipation of downside inflation risks and a return to a more symmetric inflation outlook.\nWhile there is currently tremendous uncertainty around the shape and size of any federal policy\ninitiatives, the direction of the effect on monetary policy seems pretty clear. Pursuing our\ncongressionally mandated objectives for price stability and employment means that, all other\nthings equal, greater fiscal stimulus implies higher interest rates than would otherwise be\n\n3\n\n\fwarranted. Otherwise, inflation pressures are likely to become elevated, as we saw in response to\nexpanded fiscal deficits in the second half of the 1960s.\nSome would argue that changes in regulatory policy might improve economic efficiency and\nexpand the potential supply of goods and services over time, thereby easing resource pressures\nand reducing the need for higher policy rates. It’s worth pointing out, however, that such effects\nare likely to unfold only gradually over time. Moreover, to the extent they raise our economy’s\nunderlying real growth rate, they will also increase the trend real interest rate to which rates must\nconverge over time (in the absence of shocks). 6 More rapid productivity growth generally\nimplies higher real interest rates, all else held constant.\nThe economic projections that FOMC participants submitted prior to the December meeting\nshow a slight uptick in the median projected path for the target range for the federal funds rate,\nrelative to submissions prior to the September meeting. (Participants are called upon to submit\nprojections for every other meeting, under the assumption of “appropriate monetary policy.”)\nWhile a more stimulative fiscal policy outlook may have contributed to the uptick, the first since\ntarget rate projections began being released in 2012, several other factors could well have been\nrelevant. For one, improvement in measures of inflation compensation were underway well\nbefore the election, and realized inflation has come in a bit firmer than many analysts had\nprojected earlier in the year. In addition, while real GDP growth was depressed early in 2016 by\ntemporary factors that were expected to fade, solid confirmation did not emerge until the arrival\nof third-quarter data. And finally, employment growth has not decelerated in 2016 as much as\nsome forecasters had projected.\nMore broadly, I have been arguing for some time that the Fed’s interest rate target is\nexceptionally low and that upward adjustment is needed. 7 I have based that in part on the\nbehavior of benchmarks that capture the historical behavior of interest rates — that is, how\npolicy rates respond to inflation and employment — during times when monetary policy has\nbeen relatively effective. These benchmarks, often referred to as “policy rules,” come in slightly\ndifferent formulations and are useful for assessing the stance of monetary policy. Currently,\nalmost all of these benchmarks recommend higher interest rates, in most cases substantially\nhigher rates. Some have made the case for versions whose current recommendations lie at the\nlower end of the range of plausible alternatives and thus align with the current low level of our\npolicy rates. 8 That case is not without merit, but there are risks associated with placing too much\nweight on any one estimate. Taking the range of plausible alternatives into account, my view is\nthat, with unemployment at or below levels corresponding to maximum sustainable employment\nand with inflation very close to our announced target of 2 percent, significantly higher rates are\nwarranted.\nHistorical experience strongly suggests that significant deviation from these benchmarks can\nincrease the risk of adverse outcomes. In particular, delaying interest rate increases when\nunemployment falls below levels corresponding to full or maximum employment can result in an\nunanticipated rise in inflation pressures that necessitates relatively sharp upward adjustments in\nrates. Such rapid adjustments can be hard to calibrate, and they heighten the risk of overdoing it\nand sending the economy into an unnecessary recession. In contrast, sustaining unemployment at\n\n4\n\n\for below full employment is associated with pre-emptive rate increases, before inflation\npressures are clearly visible.\nIn the mid-1960s, for example, after an extended period of low and stable inflation, a\ncombination of political considerations caused the Fed to hold off raising rates in the face of\nmounting fiscal pressures, departing from the pattern of behavior that had sustained price\nstability in prior years. The inflationary decade and a half that followed that episode — a\nfascinating chapter in the Fed’s history — provides important cautionary lessons for us today. 9\nAlthough I just cautioned against deviating too far from benchmarks, this does not mean the\nFOMC should closely follow a single pre-specified monetary policy rule, as some proposed\nlegislation would require. While there are benefits to conducting policy in a way that tightly\ntracks a policy rule, in practice such an approach is likely to be too inflexible and limit warranted\nresponses to unanticipated developments. The FOMC could take steps, however, to increase\ntransparency around our policymaking, such as including calculations for a representative set of\nrules in the Board’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress, along with a discussion of\nhow and why the Committee has departed from these rules, if applicable.\nAt the present time, I am skeptical of justifications for the large and growing departure of current\npolicy from the policy rule recommendations. My own view, as I’ve said, is that the magnitude\nof the gap suggests that rates need to rise more briskly than markets now seem to expect. And the\nelevated uncertainty now surrounding fiscal policy, particularly the potential for substantial fiscal\nstimulus, suggests that our next increase should come sooner rather than later in order to reduce\nthe risks associated with having to raise rates more rapidly later on. Such an approach would\nmaximize our chance of continuing to benefit from price stability and healthy employment\ngrowth.\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Weinberg, Roy Webb and Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nGlenn D.

Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nMaryland Bankers Association, First Friday Economic Outlook Forum\nBaltimore, Maryland\nJanuary 6, 2017\nThis speech was delivered by Kartik Athreya, executive vice president and director of research.\nIt is a pleasure to be with you again for the second year in a row. This is once again an\ninteresting time to be looking forward and discussing what might be in store for the U.S.\neconomy in the years ahead. Forecasters often are tempted by the sin of claiming that uncertainty\nis greater than usual at the present time. But I think we can all picture reasons why such a claim\nmight not be unreasonable right now.\nBefore looking ahead and assessing various risks, however, I’d like to start by reviewing the\nrecent performance of the economy. As always, the views I express are my own, and are not\nnecessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. 1\nThe first fact worth noting is that we are in the eighth year of an economic expansion. For\ncomparison, since World War II the average expansion has lasted 4 ¾ years, measured from the\nbottom of the recession to the beginning of the next recessionary contraction. Most forecasters\nforesee continued growth in 2017. One might think this expansion is getting long in the tooth,\nand that as a result we are “due,” so to speak, for a correction. The statistical evidence is pretty\nclear, however, that business cycle expansions do not die of “old age.” What I mean by that is\nthat the probability of a recession in any given time period does not vary with the age of the\nexpansion. 2\nThis expansion, however, has been weaker than past expansions. Real GDP — our broadest\nmeasure of production and incomes — grew at a 2.2 percent average annual rate from the end of\nthe recession through the fourth quarter of 2015. Before the Great Recession, real GDP during\nthe postwar era had increased at about a 3 ½ percent average annual rate, and there were periods\nin which growth was even higher. During the 1960s, for example, real GDP grew at a 4 ½\npercent average annual rate. 3\nThere are good reasons why matching those golden age growth rates on a sustained basis might\nbe a stretch. For one thing, the labor force is expanding much more slowly. During the ’60s, the\nlabor force grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate, driven by a growing population and rising\nparticipation of women in the workforce. But the labor force participation rate of women peaked\nin 1999 and has been declining since then. Moreover, the aging of the baby-boom generation is\ntilting the mix of the working-age population toward age cohorts with lower participation rates.\nAt present, some economists estimate it could only take annual employment growth of around\nsix-tenths of 1 percent (or 60,000 jobs per month) to keep up with the growth in the working-age\npopulation. 4\n\n1\n\n\fAnother reason GDP growth has been lower of late is that productivity has been rising less\nrapidly. Over the last five years, GDP per worker has grown at an annual rate of only ½ of 1\npercent. Before the Great Recession, that measure of productivity increased at a 1 ¾ percent\nrate; during the macroeconomic golden age of the 1960s, that measure gained about 2 ½ percent\nper year. Because real (inflation-adjusted) incomes per worker closely track productivity growth\nover time, the current productivity slowdown is likely to be having a significant effect on\nAmerican households’ attitudes toward the economy and related public policy issues. 5\nProductivity and employment trends are key to the outlook for overall economic growth. Last\nyear at this gathering, I said I expected recent trends to continue. I anticipated productivity\ngrowth to continue at a disappointing pace, around ¾ of a percent. Employment had been\ngrowing more rapidly than the labor force, implying a decline in the unemployment rate. So I\nexpected employment growth to remain above trend but to slow gradually as the difficulty in\nfinding qualified workers in a tight labor market increasingly restrained new hiring. As a result, I\nprojected real GDP to grow 2.2 percent at an annual rate but to slow gradually to around a 1 ¾\npercent pace, consistent with sustainable trends.\nLooking back at 2016, real GDP slowed sooner than I thought and is on track to come in a touch\nbelow 2 percent. Employment growth slowed as well, from over 220,000 per month in 2015 to\naround 180,000 a month. But that rate of growth is still unsustainably high — we need less than\nhalf that rate to keep pace with population trends. The unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent as\nof November, a relatively low rate by historical standards. Because the unemployment rate\ncannot continue to fall forever, employment growth is likely to continue to slow and converge to\npopulation growth.\nStrong (albeit slowing) employment growth has been supporting solid consumer spending.\nInflation-adjusted household expenditures grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate through November.\nSimilarly, real disposable income grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate over that period. I expect\ncontinued strength in consumer spending this year, despite slowing job growth, because wage\nrates have been rising at an increasing pace. Average hourly earnings rose at a 2.7 percent annual\nrate last year, well above the overall rate of inflation. And tightening labor markets are likely to\nadd to wage pressures this coming year. So even if consumer spending growth slows, it’s likely\nto remain above 2 percent.\nWhile consumer spending boosted overall growth in 2016, surprisingly weak investment was a\ndrag on growth. After a strong start, residential investment hit an unanticipated soft spot in midyear, actually falling in the second and third quarters. The largest portion of this investment\ncategory is single-family home construction, and here the outlook is positive. New single-family\nhousing starts are up more than 8 percent for the first 11 months of 2016, household formation is\nrising and household finances are strong. I expect residential investment to make a solid\ncontribution to real GDP growth in 2017.\nBusiness investment also has been unexpectedly sluggish, falling in the last quarter of 2015 and\nthe first quarter of 2016, and then growing slowly in the next 2 quarters. A portion of the\nweakness was due to sharply lower oil and natural gas drilling, a natural response to low oil and\ngas prices. But other business equipment spending has disappointed as well, in part due to the\n2\n\n\fstrengthening of the dollar on foreign exchange markets last year, which intensified competition\nfor many domestic producers and resulted in lower output and lower investment plans. The\nfundamentals for business investment have remained reasonably sound, however, so I was\nforecasting an imminent upturn as last year progressed.\nTaking on board the data we’ve seen on spending and labor markets, it looks as if economic\nactivity has evolved largely as I anticipated at the beginning of 2016. Both real GDP and\nemployment appear to be converging to paths governed by productivity and demographic trends,\nand these trends are currently low by historical standards.\nA year ago, inflation was expected to rise gradually toward 2 percent, and it has done so, perhaps\neven a bit more rapidly than some had anticipated. Recent data have given us no reason to expect\nthat this trend will not continue. If anything, the pickup of inflation could quicken temporarily,\ngiven recent increases in oil prices. So I expect inflation to be close to 2 percent this year.\nThe outlook I’ve just described is conditioned on only the flow of hard economic data we’ve\nseen, which basically runs through last October, together with some preliminary figures for\nNovember and December. Of course, we have also had an election here in the United States. The\nresults of that election took many observers by surprise and appear to have left a sizable imprint\non financial asset prices. While there is considerable uncertainty about how a new\nadministration’s policies might affect the near- and longer-term economic outlook, the nature of\nfinancial markets’ response suggests that investors may be anticipating some combination of tax\nreductions and increased military and infrastructure spending. Some commentators have also\nsuggested that regulatory changes could contribute to an increase in underlying growth trends.\nOn the other side of the ledger, some have expressed concerns about the potential effects of\npolicies that are less friendly to international trade and which thus might impede growth.\nTo the extent that the equity market movements since the election are either the cause of or the\neffect of a more optimistic outlook on the part of business enterprises, or both, a more positive\noutlook for business investment would be warranted. If so, the unanticipated softness in capital\nspending last year may have been attributable to a desire to delay irreversible investment\ncommitments until after the election, and a release of pent-up spending plans may be in the\noffing. Still, the investment outlook could well fluctuate as uncertainty about the anticipated\ncontours of the policy environment is resolved.\nA prudent course for a forecaster to take right now, I believe, is to build in at least some modest\nfiscal stimulus and at least some measure of stronger business investment. Such an approach\nwould split the difference between complete faith in market ebullience and an assumption of no\nchange in the fiscal and investment outlook. For me, this suggests a forecast for real GDP growth\nof 2.0 percent for 2017, falling to a long-run trend of around 1 ¾ percent in 2018 and beyond.\nThe rise in longer-term U.S. interest rates in the month following the election was roughly\nevenly split between real rates and compensation for inflation. Even more striking is the\nmovement in the implied probabilities of very high and very low inflation derived from options\nmarkets. These have flipped from a tilt toward lower inflation being much more likely than high\ninflation to the opposite; inflation above 3 percent is now seen as about twice as likely as\n3\n\n\finflation below 1 percent. In addition, the estimated term premium on 10-year Treasury\nsecurities has moved from negative territory to closer to zero, suggesting that investors see less\nvalue in Treasuries as a hedge against deflation and are becoming more concerned about the\nexposure of the nominal Treasuries to the risk of inflation. These developments could reflect the\ndissipation of downside inflation risks and a return to a more symmetric inflation outlook.\nDo post-election economic developments have implications for monetary policy? Any significant\nshift in the fundamental factors underlying the economic outlook is likely to have monetary\npolicy consequences. While there is currently tremendous uncertainty around the shape and size\nof any federal policy initiatives, the direction of the effect on monetary policy seems pretty clear.\nPursuing our congressionally mandated objectives for price stability and employment means that,\nall other things equal, greater fiscal stimulus implies higher interest rates than would otherwise\nbe warranted. Otherwise, inflation pressures are likely to become elevated, as we saw in response\nto expanded fiscal deficits in the late 1960s.\nSome would argue that changes in regulatory policy could improve economic efficiency and\nexpand the potential supply of goods and services over time, thereby easing resource pressures\nand reducing the need for higher policy rates. It’s worth pointing out, however, that such effects\nare likely to unfold gradually over time. Moreover, to the extent they raise our economy’s\nunderlying real growth rate, they will also increase the trend real interest rate to which rates must\nconverge over time (in the absence of shocks). 6 More rapid productivity growth generally\nimplies higher real interest rates, all else held constant.\nThe economic projections that FOMC participants submitted prior to the December meeting\nshow a slight uptick in the median projected path for the target range for the federal funds rate,\nrelative to submissions prior to the September meeting. (Participants are called upon to submit\nprojections for every other meeting, under the assumption of “appropriate monetary policy.”)\nWhile a more stimulative fiscal policy outlook may have contributed to the uptick, the first since\ntarget rate projections began being released in 2012, several other factors could well have been\nrelevant.

And finally, employment growth has not decelerated in 2016 as much as some\nforecasters had projected.\nMore broadly, I have been arguing for some time that the Fed’s interest rate target is\nexceptionally low and that upward adjustment is needed. 7 I have based that in part on the\nbehavior of benchmarks that capture the historical behavior of interest rates — that is, how\npolicy rates respond to inflation and employment — during times when monetary policy has\nbeen relatively effective.

At this point,\nwith unemployment at or below levels corresponding to maximum sustainable employment and\nwith inflation very close to our announced target of 2 percent, almost all benchmarks recommend\nhigher interest rates, in most cases substantially higher rates.\n\n4\n\n\fHistorical experience strongly suggests that significant deviation from these benchmarks can\nincrease the risk of adverse outcomes. In particular, delaying interest rate increases when\nunemployment falls below levels corresponding to full or maximum employment can result in an\nunanticipated rise in inflation pressures that necessitates relatively sharp upward adjustments in\nrates. Such rapid adjustments can be hard to calibrate, and they heighten the risk of overdoing it\nand sending the economy into an unnecessary recession. In contrast, sustaining unemployment at\nor below full employment is associated with pre-emptive rate increases, before inflation\npressures are clearly visible.\nTo sum things up before I close, my outlook for 2017 is for GDP to grow by about 2.0 percent,\nreflecting some probability of a boost from fiscal policy, and then to fall back to a long-run trend\nof about 1 ¾ percent in 2018 and beyond. That said, the real outlook is somewhat more uncertain\nthan is typically the case, due to the possibility of substantial changes in fiscal, regulatory and\nother economic policies. Inflation should continue to converge on 2 percent over the next year.\nMonetary policy rates are likely to increase, and my view is that they may need to increase more\nbriskly than markets appear to expect, depending on developments as the year unfolds.\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank John Weinberg, Roy Webb and Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nGlenn D.

            "content": "Does Federal Reserve Governance Need Reform?\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nMarshall University\nBrad D. Smith Foundation Hall, Huntington, WV\nOctober 5, 2016\nIt is a pleasure to be here and speak with you this afternoon. This is also a gratifying follow-up to\nthe time I spent earlier today talking with Marshall University students and reliving my\nprofessorial days.\nMy topic for today is the Fed’s governance structure. By that I mean the rules about how\ndecisions at the Fed are made, as well as how decisions about who it is that runs the Fed are\nmade. West Virginia is an appropriate place to discuss this issue, because a representation of\nbroad geographic interests – rural areas as well as money centers – was central to the design of\nthe Fed System a century ago. And a century ago is where my remarks tonight will begin,\nbecause understanding the Fed’s fundamental purpose is essential to understanding why we are\ngoverned the way we are.\nThe motivation for discussing this topic is the considerable public and congressional attention\nthe Fed’s governance structure has received of late and the several proposals for reform that have\nbeen advanced. 1 And the backdrop to that, of course, is the extraordinary Fed policy actions of\nthe past decade, which have, quite understandably, led to close scrutiny of the Fed’s decisionmaking processes.\nIn my remarks, I will argue that the Fed’s governance structure has served the nation and the\nFed’s purpose quite well. As a public service institution, we should always be open to changes\nthat lead to better policy outcomes over time. Indeed, the Fed’s structure has been amended on\noccasion, most notably in the Banking Act of 1935. 2 At the same time though, we should be\nmindful that there was a logic to the choices made by the founders a century ago, and many\naspects of the Fed’s governance continue to make good sense even in today’s dramatically\ndifferent environment.\nBefore I begin, I’ll note that, as always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues within the Federal Reserve. 3\nHow Our Structure Came to Be\nTo be sure we are all on the same page, let me quickly review the main elements of the Fed’s\ngovernance structure. The Federal Reserve System consists of 12 regional Reserve Banks and the\nBoard of Governors, a government agency in Washington, D.C., which is led by seven members\nwhen fully staffed. The Federal Reserve Banks are the operational arm of the System and are\nindependently chartered corporations with their own boards of directors, but they are overseen by\nthe Board of Governors. Each Reserve Bank is led by a president who is appointed by its board\nbut with the approval of the Board of Governors. The final component of the Fed’s governance\nstructure is the Fed’s monetary policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, whose\nvoting membership comprises the seven governors and a rotating set of five presidents, although\n1\n\n\fall of the Reserve Bank presidents participate in FOMC meetings. The Fed is entirely selffunded, receiving no appropriations from the government, and is accountable to Congress.\nIn creating this structure, the Fed’s founders sought to address what they called “the currency\nproblem.” This referred to the inability of the economy’s supply of notes and bank reserves –\nwhat today would be called the money supply – to expand and contract with the needs of\ncommerce. A number of features of the pre-Fed monetary system contributed to the problem:\nCurrency was issued by national banks and was required to be backed by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, making note issuance costly and slow. And widespread branching restrictions resulted\nin thousands of small, undiversified banks throughout the country, which meant that a substantial\nportion of banks’ reserves were held as interbank deposits. Overall, the financial system was\nvulnerable to shocks and unable to quickly move reserves to where they were needed. As a\nresult, interest rate spikes hampered economic activity on a frequent basis. 4 Before the Fed was\ncreated, clearinghouses – bank-owned cooperatives that settled payments in larger cities – played\nan important role in how periodic banking crises were resolved. They could not legally issue\ncurrency, but they issued certificates that were circulated by their members as an (imperfect)\nsubstitute currency when the demand for currency surged. 5\nThe Fed was created to “furnish an elastic currency,” so that the supply of monetary assets would\nvary with the needs of economy. Reserve Banks, in turn, were modeled after clearinghouses. The\noperation of clearinghouses, however, was limited to the cities. The idea of the founders was to\nmimic and improve upon this model to serve broader public interests. They sought to create a\nsystem of institutions with universal eligibility for membership, so all banks would have access\nto clearinghouse services. The new institutions would have the ability to issue currency and\nwould accept bank deposits to prevent reserves from “pyramiding” in large cities. 6\nA key debate at the founding of the Federal Reserve was how such a system should be\ngoverned. 7 A primary concern of the founders was the extent to which the economic\ncharacteristics of large money centers and the rest of the country diverged. The initial legislative\nproposal was the Aldrich Plan, which provided for an elastic currency issued by a single National\nReserve Association. That plan was rejected out of concern about excessive Wall Street\ninfluence at the expense of diverse regional interests. Proposals for a government-controlled\ncentral bank were viewed as risky for fear that the federal government would use control of the\nmoney supply to resort to inflationary deficit financing. At the same time, a measure of public\nsector oversight was viewed as essential, consistent with Progressive Era thinking. So the Act\nincluded a federal authority – the Federal Reserve Board, today called the Board of Governors –\nto oversee regional Reserve Banks’ operations and policies and whose leaders were politically\nappointed.\nThus, the final Federal Reserve Act reflected a balance of competing considerations: a federated\nset of institutions to provide for representation of a diverse range of geographic and commercial\ninterests, with a hybrid public-private governance structure to provide for public oversight but\ncontain potential misuse of monetary authority.\nThe governance of the individual Reserve Banks was also designed to be a blend of public and\nprivate elements. Like clearinghouses before them, Reserve Banks are capitalized by their\nmembers through the purchase of stock rather than capitalized by the government. 8 Reserve\nBank stock is unlike traditional corporate stock, however, in that it comes with no voting rights\nand is not transferrable. Each Reserve Bank is governed by a nine-member board of directors\n2\n\n\fthat is partly public, with three members appointed by the Board of Governors, and partly\nprivate, with six members elected by member banks. By statute, six of the nine directors\nrepresent the public, not banks. The Reserve Banks’ CEOs – originally called governors and\ntoday called presidents – are appointed by the boards with the approval of the Board of\nGovernors.\nWhy is This Structure Still Relevant Today?\nThe structure and governance of the Federal Reserve is still effective today because the\nconsiderations the founders wrestled with are all still relevant. While the nature of our economy\nand financial markets have changed in many ways since the founding of the Federal Reserve, the\nfederated structure still ensures that a diversity of perspectives on monetary policy and economic\nconditions are brought to the table. The geographic dispersion of independently chartered\ninstitutions has promoted broad regional engagement across the country, deepening the Fed’s\nunderstanding of the diverse economic challenges facing American communities. 9\nThe founders were primarily focused on the broad divergence of economic interests across\ngeographic regions, but the Fed’s structure has the added benefit of fostering diversity of\nanalytical perspectives as well. Each Reserve Bank president is supported by an independent\nstaff of economists, and they conduct their own economic analysis. There is evidence that\nReserve Bank presidents are more willing than governors to challenge conventional views and\nthat this has benefited policymaking. First, presidents have been more likely than governors to\ndissent on FOMC decisions, especially in the last several decades. 10\nSecond, there are historical episodes in which the scope for diverse views served monetary\npolicy well. In the 1960s and 1970s, Reserve Banks led the charge on the idea that monetary\npolicy was primarily responsible for inflation. The St. Louis Fed was an early proponent of\nmonetarist views, which for a time earned it a reputation as a “maverick” bank, but later these\nviews became widely adopted. The Minneapolis Fed showed similar early leadership by\nquestioning the idea that there was a stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment. These\nwere more than academic debates; within the Fed, they directly supported the eventual\ndevelopment and acceptance of policies under Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan that brought\nhigh and unpredictable inflation to an end. And in several key instances, Reserve Banks have\ncontinued to show intellectual leadership on topics that initially went against the grain of\nmainstream thinking but later became broadly accepted. 11\nTo be sure, our country’s understanding of diversity has expanded since 1913. 12 And it is in\nkeeping with the spirit of our founding that the Federal Reserve has taken the importance of\ndiversity seriously as we have sought to ensure broad representation of views in the formulation\nof monetary policy, including those associated with disadvantaged communities. I believe our\nrecord in this regard, like that of many other organizations, shows a combination of substantial\nprogress and areas where more can be done. 13\nGovernance and Monetary Policy Independence\nIn addition to bringing diverse viewpoints to bear, the Fed’s public-private structure helps our\npolicymaking focus on its longer-term objectives. Monetary policy can stimulate economic\nactivity in the short run, but these effects are generally temporary; over time, monetary policy\nmainly affects inflation. At times there is a temptation to provide excessive economic stimulus in\n3\n\n\fthe short run and leave the inflationary costs, which often are evident only later, for future\npolicymakers to deal with. For central banks, this implies that meeting-to-meeting monetary\npolicy decisions need to be insulated from short-term political pressures driven by electoral\nconsiderations.\nThis is not just a theoretical argument: Across the history of central banks around the world,\nwhen monetary policy has been subject to high-frequency political winds, the results have not\nbeen good. 14 And our own history shows that the temptation of short-sighted monetary policies\nis a bipartisan vulnerability, just as the Fed’s founders feared.\nIn the 1960s, for example, Congress and President Johnson wished to support spending for the\nGreat Society and the war in Vietnam and pressured Fed Chair William McChesney Martin not\nto raise interest rates. Johnson frequently summoned Martin to the White House for the famous\n“LBJ treatment” meant to intimidate adversaries into compliance and even went so far as inviting\nMartin to his ranch for a harrowing ride in his Cadillac convertible, during which his desires for\naccommodative monetary policy were made abundantly clear. 15\nMartin’s successor, Arthur Burns, badly wanted to be a part of President Nixon’s council of\nadvisors and led the FOMC in the “go-stop” policies that unhinged the public’s inflation\nexpectations in the 1970s. The result was double-digit inflation. When public sentiment finally\nswung in favor of ending the Great Inflation, President Carter selected Paul Volcker as Fed chair\non a strong anti-inflation platform. 16\nThe lesson from these episodes is clear: Monetary policy independence is essential to achieving\ngood economic outcomes. Undue political influence can and has happened even under our\ncurrent structure, and as a country we should be wary of changes to Fed governance that could\nmake such breaches easier. Nations around the world came to similar conclusions in the 1980s\nand 1990s – after long, hard struggles to tame inflation – that central banks delivered better\nresults when insulated from short-run political pressures. Most accordingly structured their\nmonetary policy decision-making processes to include independence.\nThe apolitical aspects of Reserve Bank governance seem especially useful given the potential for\npolitical influence on the publicly appointed parts of the Fed. Governors are politically\nappointed, as noted, but to staggered 14-year terms. When enacted in the 1930s, this was\nenvisioned as a way to prevent their terms from overlapping with electoral cycles. In practice,\nthe tenure of governors is typically less than half of a full term and has fallen substantially since\nthe 1970s. A byproduct is that the composition of the Board of Governors is less insulated from\nthe political process than was originally envisioned. Indeed, by the end of a president’s term in\nthe White House, it has typically been the case that the majority or every member of the Board of\nGovernors was appointed by a president of the same party. So in practice, the views of\nGovernors may not be as diverse as intended.\nMonetary policy independence has its limits, however. Independence with regard to short-term\nchoices of monetary policy instrument settings – that is, policy interest rates – must be paired\nwith strong accountability for the economic results of policymaking over time. The economics\nliterature has contrasted “instrument independence,” which we have, with “goal independence,”\nwhich we do not 17: Congress sets the Fed’s monetary policy objectives, and the FOMC chooses a\nsuccession of instrument settings in pursuit of them.\n\n4\n\n\fAccountability rests on the Fed’s transparent communications, which help Congress and the\npublic evaluate the Fed’s performance against its mandate. The chair delivers a Monetary Policy\nReport to Congress twice per year and testifies semiannually, and all Fed leaders give speeches,\ninterviews and occasional testimonies. The FOMC also provides considerable real-time\ninformation on its policy decisions: Interest rate settings and voting records are immediately\navailable the day of the meeting; the chair holds a press conference after every other FOMC\nmeeting; the Fed’s balance sheet is published weekly; the forecasts of FOMC members are\npublished four times per year; and meeting minutes are released three weeks after each meeting\n(with full transcripts released after five years).\nThe Fed’s public-private structure plays an important role in supporting monetary policy\nindependence. The Fed has independent control of its balance sheet in terms of deciding which\nassets to buy and accept as collateral (within certain constraints provided by the Federal Reserve\nAct) and when to buy them. We also are self-funded and excluded from the federal\nappropriations process. In this regard, Reserve Bank capital, contributed by member banks,\nserves as an additional pillar of policy (instrument) independence by conveying a sense of selfsufficiency to market participants. And while the Fed’s operations are audited extensively,\nmonetary policy has a limited exclusion from federal audit by the Government Accountability\nOffice. All of these measures serve to limit high-frequency interference that might diminish\ninstrument independence.\nThe public elements of the Fed’s hybrid structure provide balance and accountability. Governors\nare appointed by the U.S. president and confirmed by the Senate. The Board, in turn, selects\nthree directors for every Reserve Bank board, including the chair, and also must approve the\nselection of Reserve Bank presidents. And when the Board is fully staffed, Board members\noutnumber presidents on the FOMC.\nBankers on Boards of Directors\nThe presence of bankers on Reserve Bank boards has attracted attention of late. It is said to\nrepresent a conflict of interest since Reserve Bank staff supervise banks. But strict rules limit\nbankers’ roles. No director is involved in, nor provided information about, the supervisory\ndecisions or outcomes for specific institutions, and federal criminal statutes against conflicts of\ninterest apply to directors, including laws banning them from participating in decisions in which\nthey knowingly have a financial interest. Directors representing banks are not allowed to\nparticipate in the process of selecting and appointing Reserve Bank presidents, and the Board of\nGovernors has final approval over such selections. Directors, and indeed Reserve Banks, have no\nformal role in crafting banking regulations; this is the authority of the Board of Governors. In\nshort, bankers have no avenue through which they can influence supervisory matters.\nMoreover, best practice for any board is to seek members with expertise relevant to the\norganization’s activities. Indeed, this is why it makes sense for members to serve on the boards\nof joint venture associations, such as clearinghouses. Payments processing remains core to\nReserve Banks’ business: Fed systems move $4.5 trillion in payments every single day. Thus, the\noriginal rationale for having bankers serve on Reserve Bank boards is still valid. Buttressed with\nthe Board of Governors, the Reserve Bank boards have direct oversight responsibility for\noperations on which bankers arguably are experts. In addition, bankers have broad contact with\nconsumers and businesses in their footprints, which makes their reports on economic conditions\nparticularly useful.\n5\n\n\fMore broadly, Reserve Bank boards have always been structured to represent diverse views, and\ntheir diversity has increased over time. For example, though it was natural to have bankers on\nboards, the original Federal Reserve Act mandated that a majority of directors represent the\npublic. The Act also required the representation of varied commercial interests, and that was\nexpanded in 1977 to include “due but not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture,\ncommerce, industry, services, labor and consumers.” Over time, boards have come to include a\nmuch broader representation of professions, races and genders. 18\nMeanwhile, the role of boards in monetary policy has decreased. Before 1935, the boards\nessentially set monetary policy for their districts; they had far more control than even the Board\nof Governors. This reversed with the Banking Act of 1935, and now the role of Reserve Bank\nboards in monetary policy is strictly advisory: Directors provide crucial insight on local\neconomic conditions, but their recommendation on discount rates is nonbinding.\nIn other corporate settings, potential conflicts of interest are viewed as manageable, and I believe\nthey are well-managed in the Fed’s case. To be sure, however, the Fed could do a better job of\neducating the public about its safeguards.\nConclusion\nI stated at the outset that the proper governance structure of the Fed ought to be driven by a deep\nunderstanding of the Fed’s purpose. Many aspects of the Fed and our financial system have\nchanged since the Fed’s founding, and some claim that the Federal Reserve’s governance\nstructure is a historical anachronism. Nevertheless, our core function – providing stable monetary\nconditions to facilitate economic activity – remains unchanged. And the continued relevance of\nthe trade-offs taken into account by the authors of the Federal Reserve Act argues for the\ncontinued utility of the finely balanced arrangements they crafted.\n\n1\n\nSee, for example, Peter Conti-Brown, The Power and Independence of the Federal Reserve, Princeton, NJ.:\nPrinceton University Press, 2016; Jordan Haedtler, Andrew Levin, and Valerie Wilson, “Making the Federal\nReserve Fully Public,” Economic Policy Institute, August 22, 2016; and Narayana Kocherlakota, “The\nDecentralized Central Bank: A Review Essay on ‘The Power and Independence of the Federal Reserve,’” August\n29, 2016, Journal of Economic Literature, forthcoming, included within Narayana Kocherlakota, “Four Ways to\nReform the Fed,” Bloomberg View, August 30, 2016.\n2\nSee Gary Richardson, Alejandro Komai, and Michael Grou, “Banking Act of 1935,” FederalReserveHistory.org,\nlast updated November 22, 2013.\n3\nI am grateful to Renee Haltom and John Weinberg for their assistance in preparing these remarks.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, October 2016\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nWest Virginia Economic Outlook Conference\nCharleston, West Virginia\nOctober 4, 2016\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the economic outlook. It’s common in talks like\nthis to focus on current conditions and the outlook for the next few quarters, especially for the\neconomic indicators that represent the Federal Reserve’s congressional mandate for monetary\npolicy – maximum employment and price stability. Accordingly, I will stick to form and\ncomment on current and near-term prospects for labor market conditions and inflation. But I also\nwant to take some time to look out over a longer time horizon. I will take a look backward to\ndiscuss some of the underlying trends that help us understand current economic conditions, and I\nwill take a look forward at how these trends might unfold in the years ahead. Before beginning, I\nshould note that the views expressed are solely my own and should not be attributed to anyone\nelse in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nIn terms of our employment and inflation goals, things actually look pretty good right now.\nLabor markets continue to generate job growth at a rate that exceeds the growth of the working\nage population. This year, average payroll growth has been around 180,000 jobs per month,\nwhich corresponds to 1.5 percent at an annual rate. Estimates of the growth of the working age\npopulation are less than half of that. With strong job growth, the unemployment rate has come\ndown and appears to have leveled off at 4.9 percent – a rate most observers view as consistent\nwith full employment. As one would expect in tight labor markets, we have begun to see\nevidence of rising real wages – in the last year, wage growth has outpaced inflation by about 1 ½\npercentage points.\nInflation, of course, has been running well below the Fed’s 2 percent target. In August, the price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures increased by only 1.0 percent. That’s above its\nvalue a year earlier, when the 12 month change in that index was 0.4 percent. Certainly, much of\nthe softness in consumer prices over the last two years has been due to declines in energy prices\nand repeated episodes of the dollar appreciating against foreign currencies. But the impetus from\nthese forces has largely played out, and inflation has been moving back toward our goal. Indeed,\nthe so-called core price index, which strips out the volatile food and energy components and is\ngenerally thought to be a better predictor of near-term inflation trends, has been running much\ncloser to 2 percent: 1.7 percent year-over-year, and 1.9 percent at an annual rate so far this year.\nThere is no evidence of inflation expectations not remaining well anchored at levels consistent\nwith 2 percent inflation.\nNow that employment and inflation are running at or very close to mandate-consistent rates,\nwhat does that imply for monetary policy? One way to address this question is to look at the\nFed’s behavior during periods in which monetary policy is generally viewed as having been\neffective – for example, much of the period since the mid-1980s, particularly the period since the\n1\n\n\fearly 1990s. Where would interest rates have been set in the past for inflation and unemployment\nrates like we are seeing now? The answer is “much higher.” Even adjusting for the possible\nevolution of key parameters in those benchmark relationships, our policy rate should be 1 ½\npercent or more by now. This is the basis for the strong case I have articulated for raising our\ninterest rate above its current low level. 2 I will return to the subject of monetary policy later in\nmy remarks.\nLooking at the standard measures of economic activity that the Fed uses to assess the stance of\npolicy, the economy is doing quite well. Still, many people express dissatisfaction or\ndisappointment in the economy’s performance. The main reason for that, I believe, is that growth\nin the output of goods and services in our economy has been relatively slow, even though job\ngrowth has been relatively robust.\nSince the Great Recession ended in 2009, real GDP – our broadest measure of economic output –\nhas risen at a 2.1 percent annual rate, and it’s really been remarkably steady around that rate. If\nwe look back, however, there have been times in our recent history in which growth was\nsignificantly stronger. From 1948 to 1973, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 4.0\npercent. So the current expansion – now into its eighth year – has fallen well short of historical\naverages. And long-lasting differences in growth can make for large differences in living\nstandards over time. A constant 4 percent GDP growth rate results in the economy doubling in\nsize in less than 18 years. In contrast, at 2.1 percent, real GDP would take slightly over 33 years\nto double. Simple calculations such as these make it clear how important economic growth is to\nthe improvement in people’s well-being over time.\nWhat accounts for the 2 percentage point shortfall of real GDP growth compared to its historical\nnorm? Slower growth of labor inputs is one possibility, but as I’ve mentioned, employment\ngrowth has been fairly strong since the end of the recession. In fact, since 2012, employment\ngrowth has averaged close to 2 percent per year, which is faster than average employment\ngrowth in the earlier post war period.\nSo labor inputs cannot account for slower output growth. The immediate implication is that\ngrowth in labor productivity – the average amount of output per worker – must have slowed.\nFrom 1948 to 1973, labor productivity grew at a healthy 2.5 percent annual rate, but following\nthe recession, it has grown at only a 1.0 percent rate. Because real (inflation-adjusted) incomes\nclosely track productivity growth over time, the current productivity slowdown is likely to have\nsizeable and wide-ranging consequences. For example, at the early period’s growth rate,\nproductivity would double in 28 years, whereas if recent productivity growth rates continue, it\nwould take 99 years for productivity to double.\nThe extended period of relatively slow productivity growth during the present expansion has\nsparked a wide-ranging debate about possible causes of the slowdown and the likelihood of it\ncontinuing. This, in fact, is the topic of the lead essay in the Federal Reserve Bank of\nRichmond’s 2015 Annual Report titled “A ‘New Normal’? The Prospects for Long-Run Growth\nin the United States.” 3 It not only looks at the causal factors that help explain productivity\ngrowth, but also discusses public policies that might have an influence on productivity growth.\n\n2\n\n\fEconomists identify three possible sources of improvements in output per worker. First, growth\nin the amount of capital – equipment, buildings, software and the like – that workers can employ\nin production. Second, workers themselves can become more effective by acquiring more skills\nthrough training, education or experience. And third, our capabilities can improve through the\ninvention of new products and new ways of organizing production.\nThe first source, adding to capital per worker (economists call this capital deepening), could\nindeed account for some of the recent slowdown in productivity growth. Measures of business\ninvestment in equipment, structures and intangibles have been quite soft for the last few years\nand have generally been low during this expansion. But the current slowdown in productivity\ngrowth predates the Great Recession, and the decline in capital deepening is unlikely to be the\nwhole explanation.\nThe second source is improvements in human capital – a phrase economists use to refer to the\nknowledge and skills that make people productive. Education is key to human capital\ninvestment, and we experienced several decades of rapid growth in the average educational\nattainment of U.S. workers after World War II. But that growth has slowed more recently. Some\neconomists, such as Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, have raised questions about our\ncapacity to continue generating human capital improvement at the faster post-war pace. 4 Still,\nthere are certainly improvements that can be made to our educational system, which could add to\nour capacity for building human capital.\nThe part of productivity improvements that is not attributable to the factors described above is\ncalled total factor productivity. Think of this as the improvements that come from advances in\nthe way given capital and workers are organized – that is, from creative ideas applied to the\nproduction of goods and services. This component of productivity growth has been below\nhistorical norms for more than a decade. Pessimistic observers such as Gordon see this trend as\npersistent, and they may be correct that we have “run out of ideas.” Perhaps there are no more\nbig inventions on the horizon that will transform our lives as drastically as electrification, the\nautomobile or networked computers more recently. While that’s certainly possible, human\ningenuity seems inherently difficult to predict. Other observers, such as Joel Mokyr (also from\nNorthwestern), emphasize that ideas build on ideas, so that all of the advances we’ve made to\ndate serve to make us better at discovering new advances.\nOf course, all sources of productivity growth depend on incentives – the incentives of individuals\nto build their skill sets, or to find or apply new inventions or to start new enterprises. These\nincentives depend on many things, including the tax and regulatory environments in which\npeople live and work. One piece of evidence that regulatory frictions might be impeding\nproductivity growth is the broad decline in the formation of new businesses over the last two\ndecades. 5 This suggests taking seriously the hypothesis that proliferating regulations may have\ncontributed to the cumulative slowdown in productivity growth. Whatever benefits any given\nregulatory initiative is expected to provide, it seems worthwhile to pay attention to how it might\naffect incentives for investment and innovation and how the regulatory environment might be\nstructured so as to preserve or enhance those incentives.\n\n3\n\n\fForecasting productivity growth is essential to any longer-term economic outlook, but\nforecasting productivity growth is notoriously difficult. Some amount of reversion to past means\nis often a good place to start when making long-term projections, but a rapid rebound to robust\nhistorical growth rates does not seem likely in the near term. On the other hand, the frictions and\nimpediments to growth emphasized by Gordon and others may be with us for some time, but\npermanent persistence of the disappointing recent experience seems unlikely. So I would expect\nsomething in between: a gradual recovery of productivity growth, perhaps rising from its recent\nlow level around ¾ percent to around 1 ¼ percent. Adding in an employment growth rate of\naround ½ percent, based on Census Bureau projections of working age population, yields a real\nGDP growth rate of 1 ¾ percent. That would be my best guess of the trend for the next 10 years\nor so. I should emphasize, of course, the caveat that actual growth certainly can be pushed away\nfrom that trend by developments we simply cannot predict.\nOver the near term, however, I don’t foresee a significant departure from trend. Real GDP\ngrowth was 1.9 percent for 2015. Growth fell to 1.1 percent at an annual rate in the first half of\n2016, but it was held down by an unusually rapid decline in inventory accumulation that is most\nlikely to be transitory. With that inventory swing behind us, we will likely see growth at or above\ntrend in the second half of the year, as inventory accumulation turns positive.\nA second half rebound in real GDP growth would be consistent with the continuing strength\nwe’ve seen in overall final sales. In particular, consumer spending has been a major driver of\ntotal spending growth in recent years, rising by 2.9 percent in 2014, 3.2 percent last year and a\nrobust 3.8 percent annual rate so far this year. This growth in consumer spending has been\nunderpinned by a robust labor market and rising disposable incomes.\nBusiness investment, as I’ve noted, has been weak of late. Over the last six quarters,\nnonresidential fixed business investment has fallen by 0.3 percent. In contrast, it had risen at a\n6.4 percent annual rate over the previous five years. Part of the recent weakness has been due to\nthe reduction in capital spending by oil exploration and development companies following the\ncollapse in the price of crude oil. In addition, part of the recent weakness is likely due to the\nstrength of the dollar on foreign exchange markets, which intensified competition for many\ndomestic producers, resulting in lower output and lower investment plans.\nThe fundamentals for business investment look reasonably sound, however. So if oil and the\nforeign exchange value of the dollar continue to trade not far from their current levels, we should\nsee business investment begin to grow again later this year. Having said that, it would also be\ndesirable to see public policies move toward a more supportive environment for investment\nspending and thereby contribute to more rapid gains in productivity and real incomes in the years\nahead.\nThe outlook for the housing sector is also a bit uncertain. Residential investment grew rapidly\nfrom mid-2014 through the first quarter of this year but faltered in the second quarter. It is not\nclear why it might have plateaued, but we have heard a number of reports from around the Fifth\nDistrict that housing construction is being constrained by shortages of buildable lots and\nshortages of skilled workers. The fundamentals for housing remain healthy, however. Household\nincomes and balance sheets are reasonably healthy, and the inventory of homes available for sale\n4\n\n\fis small. Thus my forecast is for modest growth of new housing construction as supply\nconstraints ease over time.\nI will comment only briefly on two other categories of aggregate spending – government and net\nexports. My sense is that budget politics and the growth of entitlement transfer payments are\nlikely to restrain the growth of government spending on goods and services in the years ahead.\nAnd I see no reason to expect dramatic changes in our balance of trade, so changes in net exports\nare also likely to make only a small contribution to spending growth in the coming years.\nTo pull together all these short-term dynamics, with the inventory swing behind us, I expect solid\ngrowth in consumer outlays to drive overall spending in the second half. Beyond this year,\nemployment growth is going to continue to moderate as tight labor markets make it increasingly\ndifficult for employers to find the workers they need. Overall spending will have to moderate as\nwell, bringing GDP growth down toward the longer-term trend I discussed earlier.\nLet me return now to the subject of monetary policy. I’ll start by noting that much of what I’ve\ntalked about this morning as driving the longer-term outlook for economic growth lies outside of\nthe influence of central bank policy. You’ll recall that my discussion of the sources of\nproductivity growth did not mention the Federal Reserve. And monetary policy has no effect on\nthe growth in the working age population. Monetary policy certainly can influence the swings in\neconomic activity around the trend that’s driven by the real fundamentals. But such effects are\nalways temporary. Attempts to do too much to boost real economic activity with monetary\nstimulus will be ultimately counterproductive.\nThe reason why aggressive use of monetary policy to stimulate the economy can back-fire is\nbecause it will eventually lead to rising inflation. As we learned in the 1960s and ‘70s, rising\ninflation can then require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy, perhaps quite sharply, to reduce\ninflation. While it’s true that in principle we know how to respond to rising inflation – we raise\ninterest rates – history teaches that in practice it can be very hard to precisely calibrate how much\ntightening is necessary to bring down inflation without causing a recession.\nI’d like to close with some thoughts on the strategy of monetary policy. We did not drift into a\nlow-inflation environment by accident. Instead, the Federal Reserve, under the leadership of Paul\nVolcker and Alan Greenspan, made the difficult decisions that were needed to push inflation\ndown and keep it low. A pertinent example is the beginning of 1994. Core inflation for January\n1994 was relatively low at 2.2 percent, year-over-year, and had drifted lower over the previous\nthree years. Rather than wait to see inflation pick up, the FOMC began raising the target for the\nfederal funds rate in February 1994 and increased the funds rate by 2 ½ percentage points over\nthe next nine months. This pre-emptive action was successful and inflation continued to move\nlower. In November 1995 the two-year inflation rate moved below 2 percent for the first time in\nover 30 years, and it has averaged close to 2 percent ever since. And while some observers were\nfearful that the rate increases would derail the economic recovery, in fact the economy continued\nexpanding until 2001. One could argue that the FOMC’s pre-emptive moves in 1994 laid the\nfoundation for the price stability we’ve enjoyed over the last 20-plus years.\n\n5\n\n\fThe lesson I take from such episodes is that pre-emptive increases in the federal funds rate are\nlikely to play a critical role in maintaining the stability of inflation and inflation expectations.\nWhile inflation pressures may seem a distant and theoretical concern right now, prudent preemptive action can help us avoid the hard-to-predict emergence of a situation that requires more\ndrastic action after the fact. The current target range for the federal funds rate, at 25 to 50 basis\npoints, is extremely low relative to the benchmarks I discussed earlier that capture historically\nsuccessful policy. Careful attention to the lessons of history is likely to be crucial to preserving\nthe important policy gains we have made.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "Federal Reserve Bank Governance\nSeptember 6, 2016\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nThe governance structure of the Federal Reserve Banks has been the subject of public discussion lately. 1\nI’d like to provide some background on why the Fed is structured the way it is and the important purposes\nthat structure serves – particularly to the monetary policymaking process that is core to the Fed’s\nexistence. 2\nHow Our Structure Came to Be\nTo understand the Fed’s structure, it is essential to understand the Fed’s purpose.\nThe Fed’s founders sought to address what they called “the currency problem.” This referred to the\ninability of the economy’s supply of notes and bank reserves – what today would be called the money\nsupply – to expand and contract with the needs of commerce. A number of features of the pre-Fed\nmonetary system contributed to the problem: Currency was issued by national banks and was required to\nbe backed by U.S. Treasury securities, making note issuance costly and slow. And widespread branching\nrestrictions resulted in thousands of small, undiversified banks throughout the country, which meant that a\nsubstantial portion of banks’ reserves were held as interbank deposits. Overall, the financial system was\nvulnerable to shocks and unable to quickly move reserves to where they were needed, resulting in interest\nrate spikes that hampered economic activity on a frequent basis.3 Clearinghouses – bank-owned\ncooperatives that settled payments in larger cities – played an important role in how periodic crises were\nresolved. They could not legally issue currency, but they issued certificates that were circulated by their\nmembers as an (imperfect) substitute currency when the demand for currency surged. 4\nThe Fed was created to “furnish an elastic currency,” so that the supply of monetary assets would vary\nwith the needs of economy. Reserve Banks, in turn, were modeled after clearinghouses. The operation of\nclearinghouses, however, was limited to the cities. The idea of the founders was to mimic and improve\nupon this model to serve broader public interests. They sought to create a system of institutions with\nuniversal eligibility for membership, so all banks would have access to clearinghouse services. The new\ninstitutions would have the ability to issue currency and would accept bank deposits to prevent reserves\nfrom “pyramiding” in large cities. 5\nA key debate at the founding of the Federal Reserve was how such a system should be governed. 6 A\nprimary concern of the founders was the extent to which the economic characteristics of large money\ncenters and the rest of the country diverged. The initial legislative proposal was the Aldrich Plan, which\nprovided for an elastic currency issued by a single National Reserve Association. That plan was rejected\nout of concern about excessive Wall Street influence at the expense of diverse regional interests.\nProposals for a government-controlled central bank were viewed as risky for fear that the federal\ngovernment would use control of the money supply to resort to inflationary deficit financing. At the same\ntime, a measure of public sector oversight was viewed as essential, consistent with Progressive Era\nthinking. So the Act included a federal authority – the Federal Reserve Board, today called the Board of\nGovernors – to oversee regional Reserve Banks’ operations and policies, and whose leaders were\npolitically appointed. 7\n1\n\n\fThus, the final Federal Reserve Act reflected a balance of competing considerations: a federated set of\ninstitutions to provide for representation of a diverse range of geographic and commercial interests, with a\nhybrid public-private governance structure to provide for public oversight but contain potential misuse of\nmonetary authority.\nThe governance of the individual Reserve Banks was also designed to be a blend of public and private\nelements. Like clearinghouses before them, Reserve Banks are capitalized by their members through the\npurchase of stock rather than capitalized by the government. 8 Reserve Bank stock is unlike traditional\ncorporate stock, however, in that it comes with no voting rights and is not transferrable. Each Reserve\nBank is governed by a nine-member board of directors that is partly public, with three members appointed\nby the Board of Governors, and partly private, with six members elected by member banks. By statute, six\nof the nine directors represent the public, not banks. The Reserve Banks’ CEOs – originally called\ngovernors and today called presidents – are appointed by the boards but require the approval of the Board\nof Governors.\nWhy is This Structure Still Relevant Today?\nThe structure and governance of the Federal Reserve is still effective today because the considerations the\nfounders wrestled with are all still relevant. While the nature of our economy and financial markets have\nchanged in many ways since the founding of the Federal Reserve, the federated structure still ensures that\na diversity of perspectives on monetary policy and economic conditions are brought to the table. Each\nReserve Bank president, supported by an independent staff of economists, conducts his or her own\nanalysis. In addition, the presence of geographically dispersed, independently chartered institutions has\npromoted broad regional engagement across the country, deepening the Fed’s understanding of the\ndiverse economic challenges facing American communities. 9\nThere is evidence that Reserve Bank presidents are more willing than governors to challenge conventional\nviews and that this has benefited policymaking. First, presidents have been more likely than governors to\ndissent on Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions, especially since the Great Moderation. 10\nSecond, there are historical episodes in which the scope for diverse views served monetary policy well. In\nthe 1960s and 1970s, Reserve Banks led the charge within the Fed on the idea that monetary policy was\nprimarily responsible for inflation. The St. Louis Fed was an early proponent of monetarist views, which\nfor a time earned it a reputation as a “maverick” bank but later became widely adopted. The Minneapolis\nFed showed similar early leadership by questioning the idea that there was a stable trade-off between\ninflation and unemployment. These were more than academic debates; within the Fed, they directly\nsupported the eventual development and acceptance of policies under Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan\nthat brought high and unpredictable inflation to an end. And in several key instances, Reserve Banks have\ncontinued to show intellectual leadership on topics that initially went against the grain of mainstream\nthinking but later became broadly accepted. 11\nTo be sure, our country’s understanding of diversity has expanded since 1913. 12 And it is in keeping with\nthe spirit of our founding that the Federal Reserve has taken the importance of diversity seriously as we\nhave sought to ensure broad representation of views in the formulation of monetary policy, including\nthose associated with disadvantaged communities. I believe our record in this regard, like that of many\nother organizations, shows a combination of substantial progress and areas where more can be done.\n\n2\n\n\fGovernance and Monetary Policy Independence\nIn addition to bringing diverse viewpoints to bear, the Fed’s public-private structure helps our\npolicymaking focus on its longer-term objectives. Monetary policy can stimulate economic activity in the\nshort run, but these effects are generally temporary; over time, monetary policy mainly affects inflation.\nAt times there is a temptation to provide excessive economic stimulus in the short run and leave the\ninflationary costs, which often are evident only later, for future policymakers to deal with. For central\nbanks, this implies that meeting-to-meeting monetary policy decisions need to be insulated from shortterm political pressures driven by electoral considerations.\nThis is not just a theoretical argument: Across the history of central banks around the world, when\nmonetary policy has been subject to high-frequency political winds, the results have not been good. 13 And\nour own history shows that the temptation of short-sighted monetary policies is a bipartisan vulnerability,\njust as the Fed’s founders feared. In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, the Fed came under pressure from\nthe Johnson and Nixon administrations to pursue accommodative policies, setting off a cycle of so-called\n“go-stop” policy, in which rising inflation would ultimately force the Fed to raise rates abruptly, causing a\nrecession. 14\nThe lesson from these episodes is clear: Monetary policy independence is essential to achieving good\neconomic outcomes. Undue political influence can and did happen even under our current structure, and\nas a country we should be wary of changes to Fed governance that could make such breaches easier.\nNations around the world came to similar conclusions in the 1980s and 1990s – after long, hard struggles\nto tame inflation – that central banks delivered better results when insulated from short-run political\npressures. Most accordingly structured their monetary policy decision-making processes to include\nindependence.\nIndependence has its limits, however. Independence with regard to short-term choices of monetary policy\ninstrument settings – that is, policy interest rates – must be paired with strong accountability for the\neconomic results of policymaking over time. The economics literature has contrasted “instrument\nindependence,” which we have, with “goal independence,” which we do not 15: Congress sets the Fed’s\nmonetary policy objectives, and the FOMC chooses a succession of instrument settings in pursuit of them.\nAccountability rests on the Fed’s transparent communications, which help Congress and the public\nevaluate the Fed’s performance against its mandate. The chair delivers a Monetary Policy Report to\nCongress twice per year and testifies semiannually, and all Fed leaders give occasional testimonies,\nspeeches and interviews. The FOMC also provides considerable real-time information on its policy\ndecisions: interest rate settings and voting records are immediately available the day of the meeting; the\nchair holds a press conference after every other FOMC meeting; the Fed’s balance sheet is published\nweekly; the forecasts of FOMC members are published four times per year; and meeting minutes are\nreleased three weeks after each meeting (with full transcripts released after five years).\nThe Fed’s public-private structure plays an important role in supporting monetary policy independence.\nThe Fed has independent control of its balance sheet in terms of deciding which assets to buy and accept\nas collateral (within certain constraints provided by the Federal Reserve Act) and when to buy them. We\nalso are self-funded and excluded from the federal appropriations process. In this regard, Reserve Bank\ncapital, contributed by member banks, serves as an additional pillar of policy (instrument) independence\nby conveying a sense of self-sufficiency to market participants. And while the Fed’s operations are\naudited extensively, monetary policy has a limited exclusion from federal audit by the Government\nAccountability Office. All of these measures serve to limit high-frequency interference that might\ndiminish instrument independence.\n3\n\n\fThe public elements of the Fed’s hybrid structure provide balance and accountability. Governors are\nappointed by the U.S. president and confirmed by Senate. The Board, in turn, selects three directors for\nevery Reserve Bank board, including the chair, and also must approve the selection of Reserve Bank\npresidents. And when the Board is fully staffed, Board members outnumber presidents on the FOMC.\nBankers on Boards of Directors\nThe presence of bankers on Reserve Bank boards has attracted attention of late. It is said to represent a\nconflict of interest since Reserve Bank staff supervise banks. But strict rules limit bankers’ roles. No\ndirector is involved in, nor provided information about, the supervisory decisions or outcomes for specific\ninstitutions, and federal criminal statutes against conflicts of interest apply to directors, including those\nbanning them from participating in decisions in which they knowingly have a financial interest. Directors\nrepresenting banks are not allowed to participate in the process of selecting new Reserve Bank presidents,\nand the Board of Governors has final approval over such selections. Directors, and indeed Reserve Banks,\nhave no formal role in crafting banking regulations; this is the authority of the Board of Governors. In\nshort, bankers have no avenue through which they can influence supervisory matters.\nMoreover, best practice for any board is to seek members with expertise relevant to the organization’s\nactivities. Indeed, this is why it makes sense for members to serve on the boards of joint venture\nassociations, such as clearinghouses. Payments processing remains core to Reserve Banks’ business: Fed\nsystems move $4.5 trillion in payments every single day. Thus, the original rationale for having bankers\nserve on Reserve Bank boards is still valid. Buttressed with the Board of Governors, the Reserve Bank\nboards have direct oversight responsibility for operations on which bankers arguably are experts. In\naddition, bankers have broad contact with consumers and businesses in their footprints, which makes their\nreports on economic conditions particularly useful.\nMore broadly, Reserve Bank boards have always been structured to represent diverse views, and their\ndiversity has increased over time. For example, though it was natural to have bankers on boards, the\noriginal Federal Reserve Act mandated that a majority of directors represent the public. The Act also\nrequired the representation of varied commercial interests, which was expanded in 1977 to include “due\nbut not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and\nconsumers.” Over time, boards have come to include a much broader representation of professions, races\nand genders. 16\nMeanwhile, the role of boards in monetary policy has decreased. Before 1935, the boards essentially set\nmonetary policy for their districts; they had far more control than even the Board of Governors. This\nreversed with the Banking Act of 1935, and now the role of Reserve Bank boards in monetary policy is\nstrictly advisory: Directors provide crucial insight on local economic conditions, but their\nrecommendation on discount rates is nonbinding.\nIn other corporate settings, potential conflicts of interest are viewed as manageable, and I believe they are\nwell managed in the Fed’s case. To be sure, however, the Fed could do a better job of educating the\npublic about its safeguards.\nConclusion\nI stated at the outset that the proper governance structure of the Fed ought to be driven by a deep\nunderstanding of the Fed’s purpose.\nMany aspects of the Fed and our financial system have changed since the Fed’s founding, and some claim\nthat the Federal Reserve’s governance structure is a historical anachronism. Nevertheless, our core\n4\n\n\ffunction – providing stable monetary conditions to facilitate economic activity – remains unchanged. And\nthe continued relevance of the trade-offs taken into account by the authors of the Federal Reserve Act\nargues for the continued utility of the finely balanced arrangements they crafted.\nThank you.\n1\n\nSee, for example, Jordan Haedtler, Andrew Levin, and Valerie Wilson, “Making the Federal Reserve Fully\nPublic,” Economic Policy Institute, August 22, 2016; and Narayana Kocherlakota, “The Decentralized Central\nBank: A Review Essay on ‘The Power and Independence of the Federal Reserve,’” August 29, 2016, Journal of\nEconomic Literature, forthcoming, included within Narayana Kocherlakota, “Four Ways to Reform the Fed,”\nBloomberg View, August 30, 2016.\n2\nThese remarks reflect my own views and not those of my colleagues in the Fed System.

            "content": "Interest Rate Benchmarks\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nVirginia Association of Economists and the Richmond Association for Business Economics\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nRichmond, Virginia\nSeptember 2, 2016\nThank you for the invitation to speak today, and I hope you are enjoying your visit to the\nRichmond Fed. The question I would like to discuss this afternoon should be familiar territory\nfor a roomful of economists: How does a central bank know when to raise interest rates?\nThe backdrop for this discussion, of course, is the continuing speculation about when the Fed’s\npolicymaking committee, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), will again raise the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate. We last raised rates in December, after having kept the\ntarget range near zero for seven years.\nOne could ask how we knew that was appropriate and not too soon or too late. More generally,\nhow do we assess the appropriate level of interest rates? It might seem like educated guesswork\nto the casual observer: akin to deciding whether a bowl of porridge is too hot, too cold or just\nright. But policymakers have more to go on than subjective tastes.\nA systematic way to get at an answer to this question is to consider how a central bank moved\ninterest rates in response to changing economic data during a period in which it was generally\nthought to be conducting policy effectively. Such past behavior for the Fed has been captured by\nsimple algebraic formulas – called “Taylor rules,” after Stanford University professor John\nTaylor, who first proposed these in 1993 – expressing a benchmark value of the federal funds\nrate as a function of measures of inflation and real activity. 1 These benchmarks can be thought of\nas recommendations that a central bank can use to guide its policy choices.\nI will argue that central banks should pay close attention to these benchmarks. It’s unrealistic, of\ncourse, to expect policymakers to follow such formulas slavishly, moving policy rates\nmechanically in response to the formula. Moreover, several different versions of these rules have\nbeen proposed and all depend on unobserved variables, each with a range of alternative\nestimates. Thus, Taylor rules do not provide a single, unique policy prescription.\nNonetheless, as I will argue, it is important that policymakers regularly compare the setting for\ntheir policy rate with a range of benchmarks that appear to capture successful policy conduct.\nGiven the state of the economy, relative to the goals of monetary policy, what prescriptions for\ninterest rates are delivered by a reasonable set of benchmark rules? And what do such rules\nimply for monetary policy today?\nBefore I jump in, I should note that my remarks reflect my own views and not those of others in\nthe Fed or on the FOMC. 2\n1\n\n\fTaylor Rules\nMany of you are familiar with Taylor rules, but to make sure we are all on the same page, I will\nbegin with a simple generic representation using words rather than algebraic symbols.\nOn the left-hand side of the equation in my first slide is the policy rate, which in the United\nStates is the federal funds rate. 3\nOn the right-hand side are four terms. The first is the short-term expected inflation rate, the idea\nbeing that central banks take the expected rate of inflation into account when choosing the\nnominal policy rate.\nI will skip ahead to the last two terms. One depends on the gap between inflation and the central\nbank’s target value for inflation. The other depends on the gap between a measure of real activity\n– employment, say – and a reference value of that measure corresponding to full resource\nutilization. 4 Both of these terms are intuitive, in that they match up with most people’s\nunderstanding of how policy rates ought to vary with business cycle conditions: When inflation\nis below target, or employment is falling short, interest rates should be lower than they otherwise\nwould be. Conversely, when inflation exceeds target, or labor markets are exceptionally tight,\ninterest rates should be higher than they otherwise would be.\nReturning to the second term on the right-hand side, it is usually referred to as the “natural real\nrate” (or just “natural rate”) because it represents the real federal funds rate that would prevail if\nthe two gap terms were zero. I’ll have more to say about this term in a minute.\nThe Role of Rules in Monetary Policy\nThere are two ways of using Taylor rules. One is to fit a version to historical data to see how\nwell it describes central bank behavior. This was John Taylor’s original emphasis in 1993, and I\nalluded to this notion at the outset. It turns out that it can. That is, one can find coefficients α1\nand α2 such that the formula delivers predicted values for the funds rate that are fairly close to\nthe values that actually occurred.\nThe other way to think about a Taylor rule is prescriptive, that is, as a normative benchmark\nindicating how policymakers ought to behave – not for the central bank to follow mechanically\ndown to the last decimal point, but as a general guide to good policy.\nThere are two complementary reasons that such rules make sense as prescriptive guides. First, it\nturns out that simple Taylor rules can characterize U.S. monetary policy fairly well during\nperiods when the FOMC was relatively successful. For example, this is true for the period known\nas the Great Moderation -- the period from the early 1980s to 2007 -- particularly during the\nperiod since 1993, when inflation has averaged very close to 2 percent. Simple rules fit also, but\nwith different coefficients, during times in which the FOMC did relatively poorly – the period\nfrom the late 1960s through the end of the 1970s, for example. The difference is that during less\nsuccessful periods, the Fed did not respond strongly enough to inflation. 5 That is, the Fed’s\npolicy did not satisfy the so-called Taylor principle, which says the central bank ought to respond\nmore than one-for-one to increases in the inflation gap. Additional support for a prescriptive role\n2\n\n\ffor Taylor rules is provided by experiments performed in artificial theoretical economies, in\nwhich such rules tend to provide superior policy outcomes over time. 6\nThere is another important reason for policymakers to consult benchmark rules. Because\ninflation is a monetary phenomenon – that is, solely up to the central bank in the long run – a\nwide range of intertemporal economic decisions are affected by how the Fed is expected to\nrespond to inflation and employment gaps in the future. Indeed, a major lesson (perhaps the\nmajor lesson) that emerged from the macroeconomic experience of the 1970s is that expectations\ncan become unhinged when the public loses confidence in the willingness of the central bank to\ntake the actions necessary to keep inflation under control.\nTo anchor expectations, a central bank can communicate its intentions. For example, the FOMC\nhas stated that its goal is 2 percent average inflation, as measured by the annual change in the\npersonal consumption expenditures price index. 7 But this wouldn’t work for long if the central\nbank’s actions did not consistently follow suit. Market participants watch carefully how a central\nbank reacts to incoming measures of inflation and activity, and they will try to divine how the\ncentral bank is likely to react to incoming data in the future. Aligning current policy closely with\nthe way in which policy reacted in times when expectations were relatively anchored is one way\nto minimize the risk that market participants begin forecasting a departure from the central\nbank’s objective.\nWhat Do These Benchmarks Look Like?\nIn order to see what these benchmarks are telling us, we need estimates of the unobserved latent\nvariables that appear on the right-hand side. For example, the employment gap is the difference\nbetween the actual current unemployment rate and an unobserved “natural rate of\nunemployment.” This natural rate can be thought of as full employment, or the rate to which\nunemployment would converge in the absence of unanticipated economic disturbances. FOMC\nmembers’ latest projections for this figure range from 4.7 percent to 5.0 percent. 8 I will use the\nhistorical figures published by the Congressional Budget Office. Its latest estimate, for the\nsecond quarter, is 4.8 percent, similar to many others. The actual unemployment rate was 4.9\npercent in August, so the employment gap is essentially zero right now.\nExpected inflation is also an unobserved variable, representing the rate of change in the overall\nprice level that market participants expect in the near term. A conventional proxy for inflation\nexpectations is the lagged four-quarter change in a core price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures (that is, excluding food and energy). This currently stands at 1.6 percent on a yearover-year basis, indicating a small negative inflation gap of –0.4 percent.\nWhat is labelled the “natural real rate” in the chart is the intercept term in the Taylor rule,\nrepresenting the appropriate value of the real funds rate when the gap terms are zero. This can be\ninterpreted as the longer-run average real interest rate, or the rate to which the real federal funds\nrate ought to gravitate in the absence of further disturbances. Think of it as a relative price – in\nparticular, the price of consumption today relative to consumption in the future. This price\ndepends on factors affecting overall demand, today and in the future, such as current and\n\n3\n\n\fexpected income and retirement prospects, as well as factors affecting overall supply, such as the\navailability of workers, technology, immigration and the regulatory environment. 9\nGlobally, we’ve seen a decline in realized real rates over the last two to three decades. One\nhypothesis for why this has happened is the possibility of secular decline in growth, particularly\nsince the end of the Great Recession. Some economists have suggested that, for a variety of\nreasons, this is a norm we should expect going forward. Persistently slower growth would imply\nlower real rates of interest.\nThe natural real interest rate is not observable; it has to be estimated from observed data.\nTaylor’s early implementations assumed a constant natural real rate. Because actual real rates\nhave been trending down over the last couple of decades, however, it now looks as if the natural\nrate ought to be viewed as time varying. My next chart shows two estimates of the natural rate\nover time. One is a well-known measure constructed by Thomas Laubach, director of the\nDivision of Monetary Affairs at the Board, and John Williams, president of the San Francisco\nFed. An alternative, which uses more agnostic methodology that involves fewer restrictive\nassumptions, comes from two Richmond Fed economists, Christian Matthes and Thomas Lubik.\nBoth of these estimates show a downward trend, with estimates of the natural real rate that are\ncurrently close to zero. 10\nThe final chart shows a representative version of the Taylor rule from Taylor’s 1999 work using\ntwo different assumptions about the natural real rate. One uses Taylor’s classic assumption of a\nconstant 2 percent natural real rate. The other uses the Laubach-Williams estimate.\nYou can see that during the Great Moderation both benchmarks tracked the actual federal funds\nrate pretty well. Monetary policy arguably performed reasonably well during this period:\nInflation was low and relatively stable, and the U.S. economy suffered just two, relatively mild\nrecessions.\nIn contrast, the figure also shows that the federal funds rate was significantly below the levels of\nthe benchmark during the late 1960s and 1970s, a period of very poor monetary policy, when\ninflation rates were high and quite variable. This was a period in which the Fed succumbed to\npolitical pressure to keep policy too accommodative. When inflation surged as a result, the Fed\nraised rates precipitously enough to send the economy into recession. This period of “go-stop”\nmonetary policy, as it was called, was brought to an end by the strong anti-inflation policy stance\nof the Volcker FOMC.\nSo these look like useful policy benchmarks, in the sense that good economic outcomes were\nrealized when we tracked the rules pretty closely, and significant deviations were associated with\nadverse results. The stability of inflation during the Great Moderation was undoubtedly aided by\nconfidence in how the FOMC was going to react to incoming data.\nThe final chart also shows that when the Great Recession hit, it drove rule recommendations\nsharply negative. But now the economy has been expanding for some time. Labor markets have\nbeen steadily improving, reducing the size of the employment gap, and inflation has remained\nrelatively close to target.\n4\n\n\fAs a result, the prescriptions of these benchmark interest rate rules have been driven up above\nzero. In the traditional Taylor rule with a 2 percent natural real rate, the federal funds rate\nrecommendation was 3.3 percent in the second quarter. In the version using the LaubachWilliams estimate of the natural real rate, the federal funds rate recommendation was 1.5 percent\nin the second quarter – lower than the fixed rate rule but still well above the current funds rate\nvalue of about 40 basis points. Thus, even taking into account our estimates of the potential\ndecline in the natural real interest rate, it appears that the funds rate should be significantly\nhigher than it is now.\nMonetary Policy Outlook\nThat brings us up to the present. So what’s on the horizon?\nThe current economic outlook suggests our benchmark rates are likely to continue to rise. As I\nnoted a moment ago, steady employment growth over the last several years has driven down the\nemployment gap. The economy added an average of 229 jobs per month last year. Growth was\nsomewhat lower, at 182 jobs per month, over the first eight months of this year. But this is still\napproximately double the rate needed to keep pace with growth in the working-age population.\nUnless employment growth slows significantly in the months ahead, it will continue to push our\nbenchmark interest rates up.\nInflation appears likely to lift benchmark interest rates as well. As noted, core PCE currently\nstands at 1.6 percent on a year-over-year basis, but it is running at 1.8 percent on average so far\nthis year. Some have suggested the higher inflation we’ve seen in the first half of 2016 will not\nbe sustained – that it represents a statistical artifact having to do with imperfections in the way\nthe data is adjusted for seasonal effects. As always, we will need to watch the incoming data\ncarefully to see if recent trends continue or abate. Still, the data so far this year have been\nconsistent with inflation moving back toward our 2 percent objective.\nWith a steadily strengthening labor market and rising inflation, the gap between the policy rate\nand our benchmarks could continue to grow, and in any event, seems unlikely to shrink.\nAs I’ve noted, a Taylor rule is best thought of as a policy guide, not a dictate, and so it must be\nused with care. Alternative approaches to implementing a Taylor rule produce alternative policy\nrecommendations, and some are significantly different from the ones I have shown. Still, the\nrange of plausible Taylor rule recommendations lies almost entirely above zero now and is\ncentered between the two that I have shown you.\nIt’s also true that there can be factors that cause monetary policy to – appropriately – deviate\nfrom a simple rule. Indeed, even in periods when the Taylor rule I showed you fits the data pretty\nwell, it is rarely an exact fit. Concerns about risks emanating from global developments, for\ninstance, might legitimately cause policymakers to hold rates temporarily below levels\nprescribed by a rule. But the success of these benchmarks as good descriptions of effective\npolicy over time means that deviations should be neither too frequent nor too persistent.\nDeparting from established benchmarks risks muddling the public’s understanding of monetary\npolicy.\n5\n\n\fIn the last couple of years, U.S. monetary policy has frequently been described as “data\ndependent.” By itself, however, that phrase conveys little beyond the premise that the current\nstance of monetary policy has not been irrevocably locked in. The question is how does monetary\npolicy depend on the data? Benchmarks like the Taylor rule provide a concrete and quantitative\nanswer to that question by linking policy to inflation and employment, the Fed’s two mandate\ngoals. 11 Responding to additional developments that are not clearly related to inflation and\nemployment has the potential to confuse the public, increasing uncertainty about our future\nconduct and raising doubts about our commitment to our two goals.\nFirm public understanding of how the Fed conducts monetary policy is essential to achieving our\ngoals. The historical record suggests that uncertainty about future policy can destabilize inflation\nexpectations. As inflationary pressures built in the late 1960s and the Fed did not fully respond,\nthe public’s expectations about future policy became unanchored, giving rise to a spiral of\ninflationary instability that was costly to tame.\nOne could argue that things are different now, such as the diminished influence of labor unions\nand the reduced prevalence of commodity supply shocks. And central banks around the world\nhave learned much in the intervening years about the conduct of monetary policy. But that only\nunderscores the fact that if the Fed were to begin losing credibility, that erosion would likely\nplay out differently than it did in the 1970s; shifting expectations are difficult to model with any\nconfidence. Moreover, there are disturbing similarities between then and now that could\nundermine expectations, including recent challenges to the Fed’s independence in the form of\nproposed changes to our governance structure. 12 We should not be complacent about the effects\nsuch actions might have on inflation expectations.\nIn principle, we know the remedy for unraveling inflation expectations: raise rates rapidly. But in\nsuch a scenario, it would be hard to calibrate policy settings carefully enough to avoid\nprecipitating a contraction in real activity.\nSo while inflation risks might not be fashionable, I think we should pay close attention when our\npolicy benchmarks move far away from our current policy rate.\nWith that, I’ll be happy to take your questions.\n\n1\n\nJohn B.

            "content": "Economic Leadership in an Uncertain World\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nChancellor’s Distinguished Lecture Series\nUniversity of North Carolina, Wilmington\nApril 12, 2016\nGood afternoon. Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. While I do have some\nconsoling thoughts on your fellow North Carolinians’ unfortunate loss to Villanova, I know that\nwhat most people want to hear about from a participant on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) is what’s going to happen with interest rates. Before I say anything about that, let me\nnote that I am speaking for myself, and my remarks should not be attributed to anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System. 1\nLast December, the FOMC decided to raise rates for the first time in seven years, increasing the\ntarget federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent. Now that the first interest rate increase is out of the\nway, the question on everyone’s mind is how rapidly interest rates will rise in the current year.\nMany observers have noted that central banks in some other major countries have actually\nmoved toward easier monetary policy in recent months. In January, for example, the Bank of\nJapan announced that it would begin charging an interest rate of negative 0.1 percent on reserves\nheld at the central bank. In March, the European Central Bank, which has charged negative\ninterest rates on such reserves for nearly two years, announced further cuts to several key interest\nrates and expanded its asset purchase program.\nThese policy decisions were a response to slowing inflation and economic growth in their\nrespective regions. But the situation in the United States is different. As I will discuss in more\ndetail, our labor markets are strong and growing stronger, and the household sector is healthy.\nThis is fueling steady growth in household spending, which is a substantial portion of GDP.\nCertainly, many American households still face significant economic challenges. But overall, the\nprospects for continued growth in employment and consumer spending look good. As I will\ndiscuss later, U.S. economic leadership within the global economy makes divergence between\nthe monetary policies of the United States and other major economies that much more likely.\nWith that said, how quickly are rates likely to rise? As always, the future is uncertain, and neither\nI nor anyone else can give you a definitive answer. But the FOMC has provided some guidance\nbased on our understanding of how economic conditions are likely to evolve and how we will\nwant to respond. In a statement issued on March 16, the FOMC said, “The Committee expects\nthat economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the\nfederal funds rate…” Essentially the same language has been used since the Committee raised\nrates in December.\nThat statement raises the question of what “gradual” means. While the Committee has not\nformally adopted a definition of gradual, one can glean some information from the projections\nthat meeting participants submit four times a year. (These are posted on the Federal Reserve\nBoard’s website, under the heading “Summary of Economic Projections,” or SEP.) In December,\n1\n\n\fthe median projection was for the federal funds rate target to rise 1 percentage point by the end\nof 2016 and nearly another 2 percentage points by the end of 2018. This projected path was\nnotably slower than the “measured pace” of rate increases during the last tightening cycle, from\nJune 2004 to June 2006, when the funds rate target rose at a pace of 2 percentage points per year\n— a quarter of a percentage point every meeting.\nBut it is important to remember that the FOMC’s rate projections are just that — projections, not\npromises. At lift off, when the Committee predicted gradual increases, it also stated that “the\nactual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by\nincoming data.” Indeed, as the new year brought a new round of global economic and financial\ndisturbances, many FOMC participants modified their views of the most likely appropriate path\nfor policy. In the March SEP, the median projection for the federal funds rate target at the end of\nthis year was ½ of 1 percentage point lower than it had been in December — that is, it indicated\na half of a percentage point increase over the course of the entire year. This reflects the “data\ndependent” nature of participants’ judgments concerning appropriate policy.\nThe contingent nature of policy is crucial. Since the future is uncertain, the appropriate path of\npolicy has to depend on how economic conditions evolve. Consequently, one should expect the\nFed’s interest rate target to rise at a pace that is gradual but dependent on the economic outlook.\nMoreover, one should expect that differing views regarding the economic outlook might give rise\nto differing views about the most likely pace at which the target should rise. My own view, as I\nwill discuss today, is that the medium-term U.S. outlook has not changed materially since\nDecember. If anything, inflation seems to be returning to our 2 percent goal somewhat more\nrapidly than expected. As a result, my sense is that the less leisurely but still gradual pace of\ntarget rate increases that FOMC participants submitted at year-end is still more likely to be\nappropriate. In any case, this makes the discussion of the economic outlook especially relevant.\nThe Outlook for GDP\nFor perspective, recall that economic activity in the United States hit a low point when the Great\nRecession ended in June 2009. Since then, growth has been fairly steady. Real GDP, an estimate\nof total production of goods and services in the economy, has grown at an annual rate of 2.1\npercent. Employment has risen by over 12 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen\nfrom a high of 10 percent to 5.0 percent currently.\nGrowth in output and employment is likely to continue this year, I believe. The basis for that\nview is that the household sector is relatively healthy and is likely to remain so. Real consumer\nspending has risen by a solid 2.8 percent over the last 12 months due to strong fundamentals.\nReal disposable income increased by 2.7 percent over the last 12 months, and household net\nworth has risen by over $30 trillion in the last seven years. Moreover, a strong labor market\ncontinues to be a key factor supporting growth in consumer spending. Over the last 12 months\nwe’ve added over 2.8 million new jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.5 percent.\nPutting all this together, consumer spending growth is likely to be robust again this year. And\nsince consumer spending by itself accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, that’s critical for\nGDP growth as well.\n2\n\n\fThe housing market also depends on the well-being of households and is also likely to contribute\nto real GDP growth this year. Over the last four years, real residential investment has grown\nover 8 percent at an annual rate. Granted, real residential investment fell sharply in the Great\nRecession and remains well below the peak values of the housing boom. So the housing market\nmay seem sluggish to some. But new housing construction continues to expand; for the first two\nmonths this year, new housing starts rose 16 percent from the same period a year ago. And home\nprices have been rising steadily; over the last three years, the average rate of change for home\nprices has been 7 ½ percent. Taking into account the outlook for household incomes,\nemployment and wealth, residential investment is likely to continue to add to growth this year.\nWhat about business spending? Fixed investment by the business sector has grown at a solid 5 ½\npercent annual rate over the last six years, but that growth has not been steady. Early in the\nrecovery it rebounded rapidly but it only grew 1.5 percent last year. Two categories of business\ninvestment look fairly solid. Investment in equipment seems to be on an upward trend after\nallowing for some quarterly volatility. And investment in intellectual property, which includes\ncomputer software, business research and original artistic creations, rose more than 3 ½ percent\nlast year.\nInvestment in nonresidential structures is the other main component of business fixed\ninvestment. Spending in this category, which includes new oil wells, grew rapidly from 2011 to\n2014, but has contracted somewhat since then as oil producers have slashed capital spending in\nresponse to lower oil prices. Outside of drilling, investment in structures has been fairly robust.\nLooking ahead, prospects for nonresidential investment as a whole are reasonably positive.\nBusinesses continue to identify profitable opportunities for new investment. Corporate cash\nflows are strong on balance, and financing is readily available to an array of firms. So I expect\nbusiness investment to continue to expand this year despite the drag from energy sector\nspending.\nRounding out the domestic picture, government spending subtracted from GDP growth for\nseveral years after stimulus-related spending peaked right after the recession. Last year, though,\nreal government consumption and investment spending rose 1.1 percent, with positive growth at\nthe national level and at the state and local levels. The budget deal last December will provide a\nboost to federal spending this year, and state and local spending in much of the country should\ncontinue to benefit from growing revenues.\nNet exports, on the other hand, are likely to subtract from growth this year. Many domestic\nproducers now face stiffer competitive pressures from overseas because the value of the dollar on\nforeign exchange markets has risen considerably over the last two years. But the dollar appears\nto have reversed course and declined in value since reaching a high point in early January, so the\ndampening effects on U.S. growth are plausibly behind us.\nAdding this all up, the evidence suggests that in the near term real GDP is likely to continue to\ngrow at a pace very close to the 2.1 percent rate we’ve seen since the end of the recession.\nGrowth at that rate would generate further employment gains and a lower unemployment rate.\nThe unemployment rate is already fairly low, however, and arguably has reached a level\n3\n\n\fconsistent with notions of longer-run maximum employment. As a result, we should expect\ngrowth in employment and GDP to start tapering off to a rate consistent with growth in the\nnormal working age population of about ½ percent per year. If productivity advances at about 1\n¼ percent per year, which is slightly faster than its growth in this expansion, that implies\nconvergence to real GDP growth of around 1 ¾ percent.\nThe Outlook for Inflation\nThe economic outlook is not complete until we discuss inflation. The FOMC’s 2 percent\ninflation target is based on a particular measure, the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditure, which is produced as a part of the national income accounts that cover overall\neconomic activity. This measure has been depressed by the dramatic fall in energy prices over\nthe last two years. Energy prices appear to have bottomed out, however, and futures markets\npoint to an upward near-term trend.\nStripping the volatile energy and food components out of the overall price index yields the socalled core price index that often provides a better gauge of where inflation is likely to head. An\nimportant factor holding down core inflation has been the rise in the dollar on foreign exchange\nmarkets, which has reduced prices of imported consumer goods. Core inflation on a 12-month\naverage basis was around 1.3 percent for most of last year, but it has firmed more recently. This\nmeasure rose to 1.7 percent in January, and was 1.7 percent again in February. As I noted a\nmoment ago, the value of the dollar has actually declined since it peaked in January, so the\nrestraining effect of import prices has been waning.\nIn short, inflation has been held down temporarily by two factors, the falling price of oil and the\nrising value of the dollar. Since both seem to have stabilized of late, neither factor seems likely\nto depress inflation going forward. After the effects of temporary shocks that move inflation for a\ntime wear off, inflation tends to gravitate back toward the level of inflation that the public\ngenerally expects to prevail, based on their understanding of the conduct of monetary policy. As\nI discussed at length in a speech last month, I believe the evidence shows that inflation\nexpectations are well-anchored right now at a level consistent with the FOMC’s target of 2\npercent over the near term. 2 As a result, I expect U.S. inflation to average fairly close to 2\npercent this year, absent further disturbances.\nThe Case for Raising Rates\nNow would be a good time to return to the question of how fast interest rates are likely to rise.\nAs the FOMC has stated, the pace is going to depend critically on the evolution of the economic\noutlook as we see the incoming data. But even if there is uncertainty about the pace at which\nmonetary policy rates will rise, the case for higher rates over time should be clear. For\nperspective, it’s useful to look at real interest rates — that is, interest rates adjusted for expected\ninflation. The federal funds rate has been near zero for over seven years. The difference between\nthe federal funds rate and expected inflation is the real federal funds interest rate, and it has been\nnegative for more than seven years.\n\n4\n\n\fMovements in real interest rates ultimately are due to changes in the supply of and demand for\nsavings and investment. While cyclical fluctuations can simply reflect the ebbs and flows of\noverall economic activity, there are important longer-term movements attributable to changes in\nproductivity growth, demographics and the efficiency of financial intermediation. This longerterm trend real interest rate is sometimes referred to as the “natural rate” — an unobserved\nvariable that is distinct from the real interest rate that is actually observed at any point in time.\nOver the last several decades, actual real interest rates have tended to move down, suggesting\nthat the natural real rate has fallen. Current estimates from a variety of models are that the natural\nrate is either near zero or is a small positive number. This observation has two implications for\nmonetary policy.\nFirst, as this cyclical expansion continues, real interest rates may for some time remain below\nlevels seen in previous expansions. This is consistent with the unusually low productivity growth\nwe’ve seen in this expansion.\nSecond, actual real rates, at about negative 1 ¼ percent, are now substantially below estimates of\nthe natural rate, many of which are near zero. Thus current interest rates are extremely low, even\nafter accounting for the downward longer-run trend in the natural rate.\nGiven current economic conditions, there should be a strong presumption that the gap between\nthe exceptionally low current level of real interest rates and the natural real rate needs to close\nrelatively soon. Employment has continued to grow robustly and the unemployment rate is very\nclose to its full employment value. Core inflation is firming more rapidly than expected this year,\nfrom 1.3 percent half a year ago to 1.7 percent today, and inflation expectations remain wellanchored, which should bolster confidence that inflation will rise toward 2 percent in the near\nterm. For me, these considerations make a persuasive case for increasing the target range for the\nfederal funds rate and related policy rates.\nAs I noted at the beginning of my remarks, one argument that is often heard for a slower pace of\nrate increases is that the Fed should avoid diverging too far from many of the world’s other\nmajor economies, where monetary policy is either on hold or in an easing cycle. In such a global\npolicy environment, tightening by the Federal Reserve could contribute to volatile movements in\nfinancial asset prices. But the Fed’s monetary policy mandate is solely focused on domestic\neconomic conditions, employment and inflation in particular. Certainly, our assessment of the\noutlook should factor in how policy divergence might affect the domestic outcomes for which we\nare accountable, for instance through its effect on exchange rates. But policy divergence, by\nitself, is not a separate, additional consideration — it matters for our policy choices to the extent\nthat it affects the outlook for inflation and real economic activity. My assessment of the policy\noutlook takes this into account.\nTwo months ago, global economic and financial developments appeared to have heightened the\ndownside risks to U.S. growth and inflation. Given the sharp swings in U.S. asset markets, it\nmade sense to take those linkages seriously. Since then, however, the adverse financial market\ndevelopments we saw in the first two months of the year have largely reversed: equity markets\nhave retraced, volatility measures have receded and oil prices appear to have bottomed out.\n5\n\n\fMoreover, the intervening tumult left little trace on real economic data, nor on real economic\nprojections, which now largely mirror the December outlook for solid economic growth and\ncontinuing movement of inflation back toward the 2-percent goal. If anything, the inflation\noutlook has firmed, suggesting the emergence of upside risks on that front.\nWhen the Fed has delayed needed policy adjustments in the past, it has often been in response to\nfinancial market developments that turned out, with hindsight, to be false signals. The record\nshows that if we delay too long or raise rates too slowly, we run the risk of needing to make\nlarger, potentially more disruptive rate increases in the future. Given the extent to which global\nrisks to the United States have subsided, prudence suggests staying the course with a gradual\nsequence of rate increases.\nContinuing Economic Leadership\nI’ll close today by returning to the theme I started with — the relative strength of the U.S.\neconomy compared to some other developed countries. What’s behind that strength? In my view,\nthe country’s economic performance reflects the fact that the United States remains an attractive\nplace to generate and implement innovations. Labor markets are relatively flexible and\nregulatory burdens have historically been low by international standards. Our institutions of\nhigher learning are worldwide leaders in research and education, and they continue to attract\nexceptional students from both home and abroad.\nThat said, we do face some challenges that I believe our educational system is the key to\naddressing. The pattern of wage differentials between workers with different levels of education\nhas been described as a “race between education and technology.” 3 In general, new technologies\ncreate demand for workers with the skills to operate those technologies, leading to an increase in\ntheir wages relative to workers with fewer skills. But over time, we expect those higher wages to\nspur more people to obtain the necessary education, increasing the relative supply of skilled\nworkers and narrowing the wage gap. But that’s not what we are seeing today. Instead, the\n“college premium” — the extra amount college graduates earn relative to workers without a\ncollege degree — has been increasing since the 1980s and remains large. Combined with\nrelatively low college enrollment rates and high college dropout rates, particularly for lowerincome and minority students, the inescapable conclusion is that we are failing to keep up with\nour economy’s demand for skilled workers.\nWhat can we do to ensure our workforce has the skills necessary to perpetuate the United States’\neconomic leadership? A full discussion is beyond the scope of my talk today, but I will say that\nthe Richmond Fed’s review of the available research suggests several key strategies. 4 First, we\nmust do a better job of informing middle and high school students about what is required for\nsuccess in college (as well as ensure that the K-12 education system is capable of providing them\nwith those skills, although I know this is easier said than done). We can also do a better job of\nproviding these students with information about multiple postsecondary educational options, so\nthat students who are not prepared for or do not wish to attend college can take advantage of\nother opportunities to acquire valuable skills. At the same time, there is evidence that some\nstudents who are well-qualified for college overestimate the costs of attending; providing such\nstudents with targeted information could improve their decision-making. Finally, and perhaps\n6\n\n\fmost crucially, investment in high-quality early childhood education would yield exceptional\nreturns, and would help broaden opportunities for students of all backgrounds. I believe these\nstrategies aimed at bolstering growth in human capital can not only augment our nation’s\nprosperity over time but also can equip a broader range of our citizens with the skills they need\nto share in that prosperity.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero, Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nSee Jeffrey M.

            "content": "The Outlook for Inflation and Inflation Expectations\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nBanque de France\nParis, France\nMarch 21, 2016\n\nGood morning. Thank you for the invitation to speak with you. I’d like to discuss the outlook for\ninflation in the U.S., and in particular how that outlook is informed by measures of inflation\nexpectations. Before I say any more, I should note that the views I express are my own and not\nnecessarily the views of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nIn the United States, inflation has been running persistently below the 2 percent target\nestablished by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The price index for Personal\nConsumption Expenditures, the methodologically preferred measure, rose 1.3 percent over the 12\nmonths ending in January, the highest year-over-year change in 15 months. The last time this\nmeasure of inflation was at or above 2 percent was in April 2012. As is always the case with a\nsingle month’s numbers, there were some special factors at play in January. Nevertheless, the\nJanuary inflation numbers were firmer than expected and firmer than we have been accustomed\nto seeing in the last couple of years.\nDespite low recent inflation readings, FOMC participants generally expect that inflation will rise\nback toward 2 percent over the medium term, as was noted in the most recent Monetary Policy\nReport the Board of Governors prepared for Congress. 2 But it is not just the Committee’s\nexpectations that matter. We must also pay attention to — and try to measure — what the public\nexpects the path of inflation will be.\nThe Importance of Expectations\nWhy does it matter what the public thinks about expected inflation? Because expectations about\nfuture inflation affect current inflation. One way to understand this is to think about the value of\nmoney, that is, the amount of goods that can be bought with a given number of dollars. If people\nexpect inflation to erode the future value of money, they will rationally place a lower value on\nmoney today. This principle applies equally well to the price-setting behavior of firms. If a firm\nexpects the general level of prices to rise by 3 percent over the coming year, it will take into\naccount the expected increase in the costs of inputs and the prices of substitutes when setting its\nown prices today. If you multiply that across all firms in an economy, expected inflation\nbecomes actual inflation.\nIn the short term, temporary shocks such as changes in energy prices or exchange rates can cause\ninflation to rise or fall for a time. But well-anchored expectations will tend to draw inflation back\nas those shocks dissipate. Keeping expectations anchored is one reason the FOMC clearly\ncommunicates its intentions via its “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\n\n1\n\n\fStrategy,” which was first adopted in 2012 and amended at the beginning of this year, and via its\nstatements after each meeting. 3\nEconomists and policymakers have not always recognized the importance of expectations — this\nwas a lesson learned at great cost during the 1960s and 1970s, a period known as the “Great\nInflation.” Core PCE inflation increased from around 1.5 percent in the mid-1960s to more than\n10 percent in the mid-1970s. It decreased slightly toward the end of that decade, but then rose\nagain to nearly 10 percent in 1980. 4\nToday, the Great Inflation is largely understood to be the result of poor monetary policy. 5 And\nperhaps the greatest mistake on the part of policymakers was that they took inflation expectations\nas given. In the standard policy framework of the time, this suggested there was a simple tradeoff between a lower unemployment rate and a higher inflation rate. But pioneering independent\nwork by economists (and eventual Nobel laureates) Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps\nsuggested that, in fact, this trade-off would only be true in the short term; over time, people\nwould come to expect higher inflation, and unemployment would return to its “natural” rate,\nleaving behind a persistently higher actual inflation rate. 6 The “stagflation” of the 1970s, when\nboth inflation and unemployment rose, confirmed the predictions of Friedman and Phelps.\nPaul Volcker became chair of the FOMC in 1979, and the pivotal challenge the Committee faced\nin bringing down inflation was the Fed’s “imperfect credibility,” that is, the fact that the public\nexpected high inflation to continue. 7 But the Volcker FOMC soon proved that the Fed was\ncommitted to bringing inflation under control, even in the face of public outrage about high\ninterest rates and a severe recession. By the end of 1982, inflation was back under 5 percent.\nSince the Volcker era, monetary policymakers have worked hard to maintain the credibility the\nFed established during that time. 8 In the spring of 1994, for example, despite the fact that\neconomic conditions remained relatively weak following the recession of 1990-91, the FOMC\nunder Chairman Greenspan surprised markets and began raising its target for the federal funds\nrate. While this generated some volatility in bond markets for a time, core inflation fell to about\n2 percent and remained there until 2008. In fact, the stability of inflation around 2 percent led\nmany people to believe that the Fed had an implicit inflation target. In 2012, the Committee\nformally announced a goal of 2 percent inflation, and it has reaffirmed that target every year\nsince.\nAfter rising in early 2008, the inflation rate began to decline sharply in the second half of that\nyear. Given the severity of the accompanying contraction in economic activity, many observers\nwere concerned about the possibility of sustained deflation. Year-over-year core inflation did fall\nbelow 1 percent for two months in 2009, but the decline was much smaller and much less\npersistent than widely used macroeconomic models predicted based on the decline in real\nactivity. One likely explanation for the relative stability of inflation during this time is the\nstability of the public’s expectations about future inflation — a stability that in part must have\nreflected the Fed’s credibility. 9\n\n2\n\n\fMeasuring Expectations\nI just mentioned the stability of the public’s expectations about inflation. But how do we find out\nwhat people expect inflation to be?\nOne way is to ask them. There are several respected surveys of expected inflation. Two surveys\nof economists, the Livingston Survey and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), are\nconducted by the Philadelphia Fed. The Livingston Survey got its start in 1946 when the late\nJoseph Livingston, then a columnist for the Philadelphia Record, decided to ask economists\nabout their forecasts of economic variables. The Philadelphia Fed took over the survey after\nLivingston’s death in 1989. The SPF was first conducted by the American Statistical Association\nand the National Bureau of Economic Research in 1968 and transferred to the Philadelphia Fed\nin 1990.\nThere are also two widely cited surveys of consumers that ask about inflation expectations. One,\nconducted by the University of Michigan, started in 1946. In 2014, the New York Fed launched\nthe Survey of Consumer Expectations, which was designed to address several methodological\nissues in the design of other surveys.\nThese four surveys differ in the survey samples, the questions asked, and the time horizons\nspecified, but currently they all seem to be telling the same basic story: Inflation expectations\nhave been lower of late but are not inconsistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent over the longer\nterm. For example, in the February Michigan survey, which asks consumers how much they\nexpect prices to rise (rather than about a specific measure of inflation), the median respondent\nexpected an increase of 2.5 percent over the next year, down from 2.8 percent in February of last\nyear. The median expected inflation rate over the next five years was also 2.5 percent. In the\nmost recent Survey of Professional Forecasters, respondents on average expected headline PCE\ninflation of 1.3 percent in 2016, down from 1.8 percent in the last survey, but expectations for\n2017 were unchanged at 1.9 percent. Over the next 10 years, respondents on average expected\ninflation of 1.97 percent per year.\nSurvey measures have both pros and cons. For example, a survey of professional forecasters can\nbe thought of as aggregating across a wide range of modelling methodologies and judgmental\napproaches to forecasting. In that sense, such a survey can take advantage of a “wisdom of\ncrowds\" phenomenon, in which aggregated assessments outperform any one individual’s\nassessment. On the other hand, consumer survey participants might be overly influenced by the\nthings they see every day, such as gas prices, and may be unfamiliar with the adjustments\nstatisticians make for changes in the quality of goods and services purchased. This might explain\nwhy expected inflation in such surveys typically runs significantly higher than actual realized\ninflation. Still, some research suggests that surveys are the most accurate predictor of future\ninflation, at least in the short term. 10\nOne drawback of surveys is that they’re just words. Economists generally place more stock in\nwhat people do — particularly what they spend — than in what they say. That’s the rationale\nbehind Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which the Treasury Department first\nauctioned in 1997. 11\n3\n\n\fTIPS, which are issued in terms of five, 10, and 30 years, are bonds whose payments to investors\nadjust to compensate for changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of inflation\ncalculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The principal value of TIPS is tied to the CPI:\nWhen the CPI rises, the principal value increases. When the CPI falls, so does the principal\nvalue. When TIPS reach maturity, investors receive either the inflation-adjusted principal or the\noriginal par value, whichever is greater. In this way, the principal value of the bond is protected\nfrom inflation, although it is not diminished by deflation. 12\nA conventional Treasury bond, whatever the maturity, pays investors a nominal yield that can be\nthought of as consisting of two components: the real rate of interest and an implicit\ncompensation for inflation over the maturity of the bond. The TIPS yield presumably\napproximates the real interest rate component, so the difference between a TIPS yield and the\nyield on a traditional Treasury security of the same maturity is “inflation compensation” — in\nother words, the additional yield investors require to be willing to accept the exposure to\ninflation associated with Treasury securities. This is also referred to as the “breakeven” inflation\nrate, meaning the rate at which investors would be indifferent between TIPS and traditional\nTreasury securities.\nInflation compensation is not the same as expected inflation, however. The differential between\nthe yield on inflation-protected securities and traditional Treasury securities compensates both\nfor expected inflation and for inflation risk, meaning the chance that inflation will differ\nsignificantly from what investors expect on average. In addition, the yield on TIPS includes a\nliquidity premium since the market isn’t as large as the market for traditional Treasury securities,\nand thus trading is not as liquid. These risk and liquidity premia can cause inflation\ncompensation to either understate or overstate expected inflation.\nEconomists have conducted extensive research to try to extract measures of inflation\nexpectations from inflation compensation. The general approach is to estimate an asset pricing\nequation that identifies the risk premia and liquidity premia embedded in asset yields. With these\nestimates, one can then identify the portion of the spread between nominal and indexed bonds\nthat represents expected inflation. 13 Of course, it’s important to remember that this is a relatively\nnew literature, and the results are highly sensitive to the model’s auxiliary assumptions.\nWith that caveat in mind, what do TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations currently tell\nus? Similar to survey measures, inflation compensation has been lower of late — the 10-year\nbreakeven fell from about 1.9 percent in the middle of last year to about 1.2 percent in midFebruary, though it has risen since then to nearly 1.6 percent. But research suggests that much of\nthis decline was actually the result of changes in liquidity and risk premia rather than declines in\nexpected inflation. For example, the Cleveland Fed has developed a model that accounts for\nthese premia, and their most recent estimate of 10-year expected inflation is 1.65 percent. 14 This\nmeasure has been relatively unchanged for the past year.\nIn addition, as is the case with survey measures, an estimate of expected inflation over a 10-year\nhorizon puts greater weight on expected near-term inflation than on expectations for years\nfurther out. Nearly everyone expects inflation to run below the Fed’s 2 percent target in the near\n4\n\n\fterm due to the effects of recent movements in oil prices and the value of the dollar. So an\nestimate slightly below 2 percent for a full 10 years is not inconsistent with the expectation that\ninflation will move back to the Fed’s target.\nConclusion\nInflation has been held down recently by two factors, the falling price of oil and the rising value\nof the dollar. But neither factor is likely to depress inflation indefinitely. After the price of oil\nbottoms out, I would expect to see headline inflation move significantly higher. And after the\nvalue of the dollar ultimately tops out, core inflation should move back toward 2 percent.\nAlthough recent declines in inflation compensation do give me some pause, I think the evidence\nindicates that inflation expectations (as opposed to inflation compensation) remain wellanchored. Therefore, I am reasonably confident that, barring subsequent shocks, inflation will\nmove back to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. Of course, the FOMC will\ncontinue to closely monitor both inflation and inflation expectations, and if necessary, it will\nrespond appropriately.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Monetary Policy Report,” February 10, 2016.\n3\nFederal Open Market Committee, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” January 26,\n2016.\n4\nHeadline PCE inflation increased about 1 percentage point more than core PCE inflation.\n5\nFor more on the Great Inflation, visit www.federalreservehistory.gov.\n6\nSee Milton Friedman, “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, March 1968, vol. 58, no. 1,\npp. 1–17; and Edmund S.

            "content": "Can Monetary Policy Affect Economic Growth?\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nJohns Hopkins Carey Business School\nBaltimore, Maryland\nFebruary 24, 2014\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you this morning. The subject I’d like to discuss — the title\nof my talk — is a hardy perennial, but it is particularly relevant in today’s economic environment. In\nrecent years, the policy interest rates set by many central banks have been close to, at, or in some cases\nbelow, zero. This has led some observers to wonder whether central banks are at all capable of providing\nfurther stimulus to economic growth. In addition, recent developments have led to speculation about the\npossibility of a recession around the bend in the United States (and perhaps globally). This has naturally\nraised questions about what course Fed policy could possibly take in response. Those questions, however,\npresume that monetary policy has a significant direct effect on economic growth — a presumption, I will\nargue, that is based on a misunderstanding of what monetary policy can and can’t do. Monetary policy\ncan determine the long-run path of inflation, I believe, but its effect on real economic activity is generally\nlimited and temporary.\nBefore I discuss these ideas in more detail, I must note that the views expressed are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or any other members of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee. 1\nThe Determinants of Growth\nMonetary policy’s ability to affect real economic activity — when monetary policy is being reasonably\nwell-executed — can be quite limited and is almost always short-lived. 2 In the standard models used in\npolicy analysis, monetary policy’s effects on the real economy generally derive from frictions that impede\nthe rapid adjustment of the overall average level of prices, such as the fact that it takes time for\nhouseholds and firms to adjust their behavior in response to changes in the stance of monetary policy.\nSuch frictions are, almost always, short-run phenomena that generate transitory deviations in real activity,\nand their empirical significance is a matter of ongoing research and debate.\nWhat does drive indicators of real activity, such as how many people are working or how much they are\nearning? There is a consensus among economists that growth in average real income depends critically on\nthe rate of technological change. Growth occurs not only because we have more people working or more\nmachines (or, in economic terms, more labor and more capital), but also because technological advances\nmake existing workers more productive. Such advances might be entirely new types of machines, such as\nthe steam engine or the cell phone, or they might be new techniques for making existing products. In\naddition, a large body of research suggests that the accumulated skills and expertise embodied in human\ncapital are the keys to making such advances. Countries with more initial human capital appear to have a\ngreater capacity to develop new technologies and to copy or adapt technologies developed in other\ncountries.\n\n1\n\n\fOf course, economic growth is not always a smooth process. Unanticipated shocks can disrupt activity,\nnecessitating the shift of capital and labor out of a declining sector. Eventually, this shift frees up those\nresources to be reallocated for expansion in another area. In the short run, however, if the shift is large\nenough, total economic activity might contract while capital and labor are temporarily idle during the\nprocess of ramping up activity in other sectors.\nAn example of such sectoral reallocation is the housing boom and bust of the last two decades. The boom\ncontributed to over-investment in residential construction, and the retrenchment from that boom was a\nsignificant factor in the Great Recession. The labor market was simply unable to rapidly absorb the large\nnumber of workers who lost jobs in the housing sector. The subsequent expansion gradually created\nopportunities for many of them, but that process was costly and time-consuming.\nWhat Monetary Policy Can Do\nI’ve told you that monetary policy doesn’t affect growth in the long term. But poor monetary policy that\nleads to high and widely varying inflation can impede economic growth in a number of ways. First, high\nand variable inflation can interfere with the ability of relative prices to provide the right signals to guide\nthe allocation of productive resources to their highest-valued uses. If inflation caused all prices to move\nsimultaneously and uniformly, then it wouldn’t affect relative prices and the pattern of demand and\nsupply would not be affected. But experience suggests that inflation affects prices differently and at\ndifferent speeds and thus alters relative prices and distorts the production and consumption of different\ngoods. For example, if inflation initially drives up the price of drywall more than other goods and\nservices, it might be misinterpreted as a signal that society needs more drywall, resulting in\noverproduction. In this way, high inflation detracts from growth by making the allocation of productive\nresources less efficient. Many economists argue that this channel is one way by which deficient monetary\npolicy contributed to poor economic performance in the 1970s.\nA second way in which poor monetary policy can limit the economy’s real performance is by encouraging\npeople to — wastefully — spend resources trying to avoid holding money. Inflation makes money a bad\ninstrument for saving, since the longer you hold currency in your pocket, the more value it loses. This\nmakes people willing to go out of their way to keep their money holdings low, for instance by making\nsmaller and more frequent withdrawals from their interest-paying bank accounts. Resources devoted to\neconomizing on money holdings are resources that could otherwise have been spent on the production of\ngoods and services.\nMonetary policy can have a sustained positive effect on economic growth by avoiding the negative\nconsequences of poor monetary policy. This requires low and stable inflation. But this is not what most\npeople have in mind when they think of the connection between monetary policy and growth. Rather,\npeople envision monetary policy boosting growth by stimulating aggregate demand with low interest\nrates. Here, I think, the evidence suggests that the powers of monetary policy are quite limited when\nmonetary policy itself is not a source of instability. 3 Unanticipated changes in the stance of monetary\npolicy — monetary shocks, as economists call them — can boost economic activity, but this effect is\ntemporary. Attempts to systematically and persistently stimulate growth in this way will lead to rising\ninflation, and the central bank will find itself needing to change course by raising interest rates and\ncausing a recession in order to rein in inflation. The experience of the 1970s and early 1980s demonstrates\nthe undesirable nature of such a monetary policy strategy.\nThere is, by the way, another way in which a central bank can affect real economic activity. A central\nbank can use its balance sheet to alter the allocation of credit in the economy. By lending to or buying the\nsecurities of private sector entities, central bank credit allocation can cause more resources to flow to\nthose segments of the economy than would otherwise be the case. This deprives other sectors of\n\n2\n\n\fresources, however, and may distort economic activity in a way that is unproductive. Importantly though,\nI would not characterize central bank credit allocation as monetary policy, but rather as fiscal policy. As a\nresult, I believe it is appropriate for such actions to be taken only by elected branches of government, not\nby the central bank. 4\nSo far I’ve talked about the adverse effects of monetary policy on economic growth. What positive role\ncan it play?\nMonetary policy is uniquely capable of affecting the price level over the longer term. The mechanism\nthrough which monetary policy has its ultimate effect on the price level is through the process of money\ncreation, that is, the process by which central bank actions affect the distinct forms of money, such as\nbank deposits, that people use in transactions for goods and services. It is more common these days to\nthink of monetary policy as setting an interest rate target, rather than a money supply, in part because\nmoney demand seems to fluctuate significantly. 5 Nonetheless, prior to 2008, the Fed achieved its target\nfor the federal funds rate — the price of an overnight loan of reserves — by manipulating the supply of\nbank reserves. Reductions in the Fed’s interest rate target necessitated increases in the supply of bank\nreserves. The resulting money creation by the central bank and the private banking system in turn drives\nprice level determination.\nThe unique ability of monetary policy to affect the price level, or the rate of inflation, over time is\nembedded in the statement of longer-run goals issued by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 6\nIt states that “the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence\nthe Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.”\nAs I noted earlier, if frictions in goods or financial markets impede price adjustment, then monetary\npolicy may temporarily affect real economic activity along with the price level. In particular, a low\ninterest rate policy will tend to stimulate real activity for a time. These effects can give rise to a short-run\nempirical correlation between the observed behavior of inflation and real economic activity. Such\ncorrelations are often referred to as “the Phillips curve” — resource utilization or real activity positively\ncorrelated with inflation. As I’m sure you all know, however, correlation is not causation, and we should\nnot interpret the Phillips curve as indicating that a low interest rate raises inflation because the stimulation\nof real activity puts upward pressure on (real) resource costs.\nRecent Experience\nReconciling the behavior of monetary measures with the behavior of inflation has been more difficult\nsince the crisis. The dramatic increase in the Fed’s monetary liabilities after 2008 — from just under $1\ntrillion to over $4 trillion now — caused concern that surging inflation was imminent. That hasn’t\nhappened. Inflation has not only failed to rise, but has been persistently low relative to the FOMC’s stated\ngoal of 2 percent. The last reading of 2 percent or greater for the 12-month change in the personal\nconsumption price index was in April 2012, and since 2013, the core index has fluctuated between 1.3\nand 1.7 percent.\nIn fact, some argue that the zero lower bound on interest rates has been interfering with the Fed’s ability\nto keep inflation from falling. This is based on the idea, widely attributed to Swedish economist Knut\nWicksell, that keeping inflation close to our objective requires that the real short-term interest rate should\ntrack the economy’s underlying “natural” real rate of interest. 7 Because the Fed’s nominal interest rate\ntarget has been constrained by zero, policy might be disinflationary if the natural real rate has fallen\nsignificantly.\n\n3\n\n\fThis hypothesis is more difficult to assess, because the natural real interest rate is not directly observable,\nand so independent measurements naturally depend on auxiliary assumptions and theories. Current\nestimates of the natural rate of interest in the United States are subject to a fair amount of uncertainty, but\nmost are clustered at or just above zero. This is well above the actual real funds rate, which has been\nrunning below negative one. 8 So at this point, estimates of the natural real rate of interest do not suggest\nthat the zero lower bound is impeding the Fed’s ability to attain its 2 percent inflation objective. In fact,\nthis perspective would bolster the case for raising the federal funds rate target.\nWhile inflation has been running below the Fed’s target, inflation expectations also seem to have declined\nrecently. One way to measure inflation expectations is by calculating the difference in yields between\nTreasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), which are indexed to inflation, and traditional Treasury\nnotes of the same maturity, which are not indexed to inflation. This difference represents the additional\nyield investors require as compensation for the effects of inflation on dollar-denominated returns on\ntraditional Treasury securities. This measure of inflation compensation for the next 10 years has fallen\nfrom about 1.9 percent in the middle of last year to about 1.2 percent recently. However, inflation\ncompensation also includes an implicit premium for inflation risk, that is, the risk that inflation will be\nsignificantly different from what investors expect. Several analyses suggest that much of the recent\ndecline in total inflation compensation could represent a decline in this risk premium. For example, a\nmodel developed by the Cleveland Fed that accounts for risk premia currently estimates that 10-year\nexpected inflation is 1.7 percent and has been fairly stable through most of 2015. 9\nWe should also remember that a 10-year expected inflation estimate puts greater weight on expected nearterm inflation than on years further out. Nearly everyone expects inflation to run below the Fed’s 2\npercent target in the near term, as a result of declines in oil prices and the value of the dollar on foreign\nexchange markets. These effects are likely to be transitory, so an estimate slightly below 2 percent for the\nfull 10 years is consistent with a belief that inflation will move back to the Fed’s target. In fact, by\ncomparing measures of expected inflation over five- and 10-year horizons, one can extract an estimate of\nthe inflation rate investors expect to prevail between five and 10 years from now. Using the Cleveland\nFed’s model, for example, yields an estimate of 1.9 percent.\nOf course, we can also glean information about the inflation rate people expect to prevail from surveys of\nbusinesses and consumers. For example, according to the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer\nExpectations, consumers expect inflation to average about 2.5 percent over the next three years. The\nUniversity of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers shows expected inflation over the next five years\naveraging 2.4 percent. Both these measures of expectations have declined slightly recently but overall\nremain consistent with the Fed’s inflation target.\nInflation expectations play an important role in determining actual inflation. As a result, a central bank’s\nability to control inflation rests in part on its ability to stabilize longer-run inflation expectations. And the\nfact that no single measure of the public’s inflation expectations is perfect means we need to carefully\nmonitor a wide range of indicators, including surveys and measures from financial markets. While it is\nconceivable that the central bank could anchor expectations and the long-run behavior of inflation simply\nby stating a goal, it is more likely that the credibility of the goal depends on the public’s belief that the\ncentral bank has and will use the tools necessary to make inflation return to its goal, should that become\nnecessary. So again, we should look to the mechanism through which central bank actions affect money\ncreation and ultimately the price level, taking into account how the monetary policy toolkit has changed\nsince the financial crisis.\n\n4\n\n\fThe New Monetary Policy Environment\nSome economists have argued that once interest rates fall to their effective lower bound, monetary policy\nmay be incapable of raising inflation. 10 I would argue that this critique neglects a key characteristic of\nbank reserves. While Treasury securities can be held by any financial entity, bank reserves can only be\nheld by banks. 11 The banking system can shed other assets in order to accommodate larger reserve\naccount balances, but there is an upper limit to this process. At some point, banks would have to raise\nmore capital in order to accommodate higher reserve account balances. This would force broader changes\nin portfolios that would inevitably affect economic outcomes, including the price level. Before this\noccurs, however, there is a broad zone in which the quantity of bank reserves can vary without affecting\nthe price level. 12\nThis basic story seems consistent with the difficulty of finding conclusive evidence of economic effects\nfrom the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases. It seems plausible — and indeed to me seems likely — that\nsuccessive rounds of quantitative easing have had little or no tangible effect, apart from signaling\nregarding the FOMC’s outlook for future economic growth and policy settings. At the same time, this\nlogic implies that large enough asset purchases would compel changes in bank balance sheets that would\nin turn affect inflation outcomes. This analysis confirms the intuition that the standard approach remains\nrelevant and monetary policy still has the capacity to determine inflation and the price level over time.\nConclusion\nSince the financial crisis, policymakers and citizens alike have looked to the Fed to foster both financial\nstability and economic growth, and our nation’s central bankers have gone to great lengths in an effort to\nachieve these objectives. But the role of the Fed is not to prevent every recession or to soothe every\ninstance of financial instability, nor is it within its power to do so: Central banks garner too much praise\nwhen times are good and too much blame when times are bad. It is within the Fed’s power to control the\nlong-run path of the price level, and this remains true even in a world with interest on reserves and large\nbank reserve account balances. Still, the Fed does have an important role to play in fostering economic\ngrowth, because economies thrive best in an environment of basic monetary stability. In my view, the\nmost important contribution central bankers can make to economic growth is low and stable inflation.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nMilton Friedman, “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, March 1968, vol. 58, no. 1, pp. 117.\n3\nSee Jean Boivin and Marc P.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, January 2016\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nAnnual Meeting of the South Carolina Business & Industry Political Education Committee\nColumbia, South Carolina\nJanuary 12, 2016\n\nIt is a pleasure to discuss the economic outlook with you here today. Before I begin, I should\nnote that I am speaking for myself, and my remarks should not be attributed to anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System. 1\nIt’s fair to say that the Federal Reserve received a substantial amount of media attention last\nyear. For most of the year, the focus was on when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nwould increase its target interest rate. Naturally, there was a good deal of press coverage when\nfinally, on Dec. 16, we announced our decision to raise rates. That coverage was well deserved,\nsince it was our first rate increase since we lowered short-term interest rates to virtually zero\nseven years earlier, in December 2008. Raising interest rates marks a significant milestone in this\nexpansion, because it reflects the fundamental strength of the U.S. economy.\nNow that the first interest rate increase is out of the way, attention naturally turns to the question\nof how fast interest rates will rise in the coming year. As always, the future is uncertain, and\nneither I nor anyone else can give you a definitive answer. That said, the FOMC has provided\nsome helpful thoughts based on our understanding of how economic conditions are likely to\nevolve and how we are going to need to respond. In a statement issued on Dec. 16, the FOMC\nstated that “The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will\nwarrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate….”\nThat statement naturally raises the question of what “gradual” means. The Committee has not\nformally adopted a definition of gradual, but one can glean some information from the\nprojections that meeting participants submitted in December and published in a document called\nthe Summary of Economic Projections. The median projection for the year-end federal funds rate\ntarget over the next three years rises at about a percentage point per year. This is notably slower\nthan the pace of rate increases in the last tightening cycle — June 2004 to June 2006.\nBut one needs to interpret this with care: These are projections, not promises. Later in the same\nparagraph, the FOMC said that “the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the\neconomic outlook as informed by incoming data.” This contingent nature of policy is worth\nemphasizing. As I said earlier, the future is uncertain, and we know that the appropriate path of\nmonetary policy should depend on how economic conditions evolve. So one should expect the\nFed’s interest rate target to rise at a pace that is gradual but dependent on the economic outlook.\nAnd that makes a discussion of the economic outlook today especially relevant.\nTo put the current outlook in perspective, recall that the U.S. economy hit a low point during the\nGreat Recession in June 2009. Since then, we’ve seen steady cumulative growth. Real GDP, an\n1\n\n\festimate of total production in the economy, has risen at an annual rate of 2.2 percent,\nemployment has risen by almost 12 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen from a\nhigh of 10 percent to the current rate of 5 percent.\nMy view is that growth in output and employment is likely to continue in 2016. The basis for\nthat view is that the household sector is relatively healthy and likely to remain so. Real consumer\nspending has risen by a solid 2.5 percent over the last 12 months due to strong fundamentals.\nReal disposable personal income has grown more rapidly than spending, rising by 3.5 percent\nover the last 12 months; household debt remains well below the levels reached seven years ago;\nand the net worth of households has risen by $28 trillion over the last six years.\nA strong labor market is a key factor supporting consumer spending gains. Over the last 12\nmonths we’ve added over 2.6 million new jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen by eighttenths of a percentage point. We are beginning to see some hints of an acceleration in wage rates\nas well. For example, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.3 percent over the last 12 months,\nversus a 2.0 percent annual rate over the previous five years.\nPutting this all together, I would be quite surprised if consumer spending growth is not robust\nagain this year. And since consumer spending by itself accounts for more than two-thirds of\nGDP, that’s critical for GDP growth as well. To see this, suppose that real consumer spending\nincreases by 3 percent this year — very close to the average we’ve seen over the last two years.\nThen, with no growth in any other spending categories, real GDP would still grow by just over 2\npercent, not far from the 2.2 percent average growth of this recovery.\nBut we are likely to do better than no growth outside consumer spending. The housing market\nalso depends on the economic well-being of households and also is likely to contribute to GDP\ngrowth this year. Over the last four years, real residential investment has grown at an annual rate\nof 8.4 percent. Granted, real residential investment fell sharply in the Great Recession and\nremains well below its level at the peak of the housing boom. So the housing market may still\nseem sluggish to some. But we have seen real momentum and a steady advance in home prices\nover the last three years. New housing starts have increased by 16 percent over the last 12\nmonths, and employment in residential construction has increased by 5 ½ percent. Taking into\naccount the prospects for household incomes, employment and wealth, I expect residential\ninvestment to continue to add to GDP growth this year.\nWhat about other types of investment? Nonresidential fixed investment has grown at a solid 5 ½\npercent annual rate over the last six years, but growth has fluctuated over time. It’s been as high\nas 12 percent early in the recovery but was only 2.2 percent last year. The largest portion of\nnonresidential investment spending is in the equipment category, which grew rapidly\nimmediately after the recession and continues to expand. Investment in intellectual property —\nwhich includes computer software, business research and original artistic creations — has grown\nsteadily since the recession. Spending across these two categories accounts for over three-fourths\nof business fixed investment, and has grown at more than 3 percent over the last 4 quarters.\nThe remainder of business fixed investment is in nonresidential structures. Spending in this\ncategory grew rapidly from the end of the recession through the first quarter of 2014, but it has\n2\n\n\fcontracted somewhat since then. The source of the decline is clear: New oil wells are counted as\nstructures, and oil producers have slashed capital spending in response to lower oil prices.\nLooking ahead, it seems clear that many businesses continue to identify profitable opportunities\nto install new capital. Corporate cash flows are strong and financing is readily available for an\narray of firms. I expect solid growth in overall business investment this year, despite the drag\nfrom energy sector spending.\nRounding out the domestic picture, government spending has subtracted from GDP growth since\nstimulus-related spending peaked right after the recession. More recently, growth in state and\nlocal tax revenues has fueled spending growth that has offset the drag on GDP growth from\ndeclining federal spending. The recent budget deal will provide a boost to federal spending this\nyear, however, and state and local spending in much of the country should continue to benefit\nfrom growing revenues.\nNet exports, on the other hand, are likely to subtract from growth this year as the trade deficit\nwidens. Many domestic producers now face stiffer competitive pressures from overseas, due to\nthe value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets having risen by over 20 percent in the last\nyear and a half.\nPutting all this together suggests that in the near term real GDP is likely to continue to grow at a\npace very close to the 2.2 percent rate we’ve seen since the end of the recession. Growth at that\nrate would generate strong employment gains and a further decline in unemployment. The\nunemployment rate is already fairly low, however, and arguably has reached a level consistent\nwith notions of longer-run maximum employment. As a result, we should expect growth in\nemployment and real GDP to start tapering off over the next year or two to a rate consistent with\ngrowth in the working age population of about a ½ percent per year. If productivity continues to\nadvance at about 1 ¼ percent per year, as it has during this expansion, that implies convergence\nto real GDP growth of around 1 ¾ percent.\nThe economic outlook is not complete until we discuss inflation. The FOMC’s 2 percent\ninflation target is based on a particular measure, the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditure, which is produced as a byproduct of the national income accounts that cover overall\neconomic activity. This measure has risen by only 0.4 percent over the 12 months that ended in\nNovember. Obviously, the major factor here is energy prices. The price of crude oil has fallen\nfrom over $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to $35 per barrel recently. The accompanying declines in\nthe prices of gasoline, heating oil and natural gas have held down headline inflation. Energy\nprices cannot register substantial declines forever, though, and in fact futures markets suggest an\nupward near-term trend.\nStripping the volatile energy and food components out of the overall price index yields the core\nprice index that often provides a better gauge of where overall inflation is likely to head. Core\ninflation has averaged 1.3 percent over the last 12 months, closer to the FOMC’s target. An\nimportant factor holding down core inflation has been the rise in the dollar on foreign exchange\nmarkets, which has reduced import prices.\n\n3\n\n\fIn short, inflation has been held down by two factors, the falling price of oil and the rising value\nof the dollar. But neither factor is likely to depress inflation indefinitely. After the price of oil\nbottoms out, I would expect to see headline inflation move significantly higher. And after the\nvalue of the dollar ultimately tops out, core inflation should move back toward 2 percent.\nMeasures of expected inflation from asset prices and surveys are consistent with that projection.\nThus I remain confident that, barring subsequent shocks, inflation will move back to the\nFOMC’s 2 percent objective over the near term.\nNow would be a good time to return to the question of how fast interest rates are likely to rise.\nAs I noted earlier, the pace is going to depend critically on the evolution of the economic outlook\nas we see the incoming data. If oil prices bottom out and the value of the dollar peaks, but\ninflation does not soon move back toward 2 percent, a shallower path for interest rates would\nmake sense. If inflation moves rapidly back toward 2 percent, however, a more aggressive path\nwould be in order.\nWhile there is uncertainty about the pace at which monetary policy rates will rise, the case for an\nupward adjustment in rates should be clear. One way to see the case is to look at real interest\nrates — that is, interest rates adjusted for expected inflation. The federal funds rate has been near\nzero for over seven years. A variety of measures indicate that over that time inflation has been\nexpected to trend back to 2 percent or higher. The difference — the funds rate minus expected\ninflation — is the real interest rate, and it has been negative for more than seven years.\nThis is an exceptional occurrence by historical standards. The way to understand this is to\nrecognize that a real interest rate is the price at which businesses and households can exchange\npurchasing power today for purchasing power in the future. This price should depend on the\nrelative supply of and demand for goods today and goods in the future. Low or even negative\nreal interest rates make sense when economic activity is weak, to encourage people to shift\nspending from the future to the present. Conversely, when economic activity is strong or growing\nrapidly, real interest rates ought to be higher. The current strength of U.S. economic growth,\nparticularly the robust growth in consumer spending, is a powerful argument for higher real\ninterest rates.\nApart from cyclical movements in real interest rates, however, there are longer-run swings in real\ninterest rates that policymakers need to take into account. The supply of and demand for savings\nand investment can shift noticeably over time in response to more gradual economic\ndevelopments. Demographic shifts, changes in productivity growth and improvements in\nfinancial intermediation are all capable of altering the trend real interest rate, around which\nshort-term fluctuations take place. Economists call this the “natural” real interest rate, to\ndistinguish it from the real interest rate that actually prevails at any one time.\nIf you look back over the last several decades, a downward movement in actual real interest rates\nis clear, suggesting that the natural real rate has fallen. In recent years, economists using a\nvariety of models have estimated that the current natural real rate is quite low — most estimates\ncluster around zero or just above. This is one reason to expect that in this expansion short-term\ninterest rates are not likely to reach the levels reached in previous expansions, an assessment that\n\n4\n\n\fis consistent with the longer-run funds rate projections of FOMC participants as reported in the\nSummary of Economic Projections.\nI agree that we are in a period of lower-than-average real interest rates, and that this has\nimplications for monetary policy. The important point to recognize, however, is that actual real\ninterest rates — at about negative 1 ¾ percent — are now substantially below estimates of the\ncurrent natural rate, which as I noted are around zero. Moreover, while the natural interest rate is\nlower than usual right now, over time one might expect it to rise as it reverts toward its longerrun mean. So despite the relatively low natural real interest rate, there are still strong reasons to\nexpect real short-term interest rates to rise in the near term.\nThe broad takeaway, I’d suggest, is that even though interest rates are likely to be lower than\nusual for the next few years, monetary policy is still highly accommodative right now. Interest\nrate increases within the range envisioned by FOMC participants would be relatively slow by\nhistoric standards, and would still leave policy in an accommodative stance. Such increases\nshould be viewed as a sign of the strength of the U.S. economy, and to me, that is good news.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n5\n\n\f",

            "content": "Economic Outlook, January 2016\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nMaryland Bankers Association’s First Friday Economic Outlook Forum\nBaltimore, Maryland\nJanuary 8, 2016\n\nIt is a pleasure to discuss the economic outlook with you here today. Before I begin, I should\nnote that I am speaking for myself, and my remarks should not be attributed to anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System. 1\nIt’s fair to say that the Federal Reserve received a substantial amount of media attention last\nyear. For most of the year, the focus was on when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nwould increase its target interest rate. Naturally, there was a good deal of press coverage when\nfinally, on Dec. 16, we announced our decision to raise rates. That coverage was well deserved,\nsince it was our first rate increase since we lowered short-term interest rates to virtually zero\nseven years earlier, in December 2008. Raising interest rates marks a significant milestone in this\nexpansion, because it reflects the fundamental strength of the U.S. economy.\nNow that the first interest rate increase is out of the way, attention naturally turns to the question\nof how fast interest rates will rise in the coming year. As always, the future is uncertain, and\nneither I nor anyone else can give you a definitive answer. That said, the FOMC has provided\nsome helpful thoughts based on our understanding of how economic conditions are likely to\nevolve and how we are going to need to respond. In a statement issued on Dec. 16, the FOMC\nstated that “The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will\nwarrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate….”\nThat statement naturally raises the question of what “gradual” means. The Committee has not\nformally adopted a definition of gradual, but one can glean some information from the\nprojections that meeting participants submitted in December and published in a document called\nthe Summary of Economic Projections. The median projection for the year-end federal funds rate\ntarget over the next three years rises at about a percentage point per year. This is notably slower\nthan the pace of rate increases in the last tightening cycle — June 2004 to June 2006.\nBut one needs to interpret this with care: These are projections, not promises. Later in the same\nparagraph, the FOMC said that “the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the\neconomic outlook as informed by incoming data.” This contingent nature of policy is worth\nemphasizing. As I said earlier, the future is uncertain, and we know that the appropriate path of\nmonetary policy should depend on how economic conditions evolve. So one should expect the\nFed’s interest rate target to rise at a pace that is gradual but dependent on the economic outlook.\nAnd that makes a discussion of the economic outlook today especially relevant.\nTo put the current outlook in perspective, recall that the U.S. economy hit a low point during the\nGreat Recession in June 2009. Since then, we’ve seen steady cumulative growth. Real GDP, an\n1\n\n\festimate of total production in the economy, has risen at an annual rate of 2.2 percent,\nemployment has risen by almost 12 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen from a\nhigh of 10 percent to the current rate of 5 percent.\nMy view is that growth in output and employment is likely to continue in 2016. The basis for\nthat view is that the household sector is relatively healthy and likely to remain so. Real consumer\nspending has risen by a solid 2.5 percent over the last 12 months due to strong fundamentals.\nReal disposable personal income has grown more rapidly than spending, rising by 3.5 percent\nover the last 12 months; household debt remains well below the levels reached seven years ago;\nand the net worth of households has risen by $28 trillion over the last six years.\nA strong labor market is a key factor supporting consumer spending gains. Over the last 12\nmonths we’ve added over 2.6 million new jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen by eighttenths of a percentage point. We are beginning to see some hints of an acceleration in wage rates\nas well. For example, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.3 percent over the last 12 months,\nversus a 2.0 percent annual rate over the previous five years.\nPutting this all together, I would be quite surprised if consumer spending growth is not robust\nagain this year. And since consumer spending by itself accounts for more than two-thirds of\nGDP, that’s critical for GDP growth as well. To see this, suppose that real consumer spending\nincreases by 3 percent this year — very close to the average we’ve seen over the last two years.\nThen, with no growth in any other spending categories, real GDP would still grow by just over 2\npercent, not far from the 2.2 percent average growth of this recovery.\nBut we are likely to do better than no growth outside consumer spending. The housing market\nalso depends on the economic well-being of households and also is likely to contribute to GDP\ngrowth this year. Over the last four years, real residential investment has grown at an annual rate\nof 8.4 percent. Granted, real residential investment fell sharply in the Great Recession and\nremains well below its level at the peak of the housing boom. So the housing market may still\nseem sluggish to some. But we have seen real momentum and a steady advance in home prices\nover the last three years. New housing starts have increased by 16 percent over the last 12\nmonths, and employment in residential construction has increased by 5 ½ percent. Taking into\naccount the prospects for household incomes, employment and wealth, I expect residential\ninvestment to continue to add to GDP growth this year.\nWhat about other types of investment? Nonresidential fixed investment has grown at a solid 5 ½\npercent annual rate over the last six years, but growth has fluctuated over time. It’s been as high\nas 12 percent early in the recovery but was only 2.2 percent last year. The largest portion of\nnonresidential investment spending is in the equipment category, which grew rapidly\nimmediately after the recession and continues to expand. Investment in intellectual property —\nwhich includes computer software, business research and original artistic creations — has grown\nsteadily since the recession. Spending across these two categories accounts for over three-fourths\nof business fixed investment, and has grown at more than 3 percent over the last 4 quarters.\nThe remainder of business fixed investment is in nonresidential structures. Spending in this\ncategory grew rapidly from the end of the recession through the first quarter of 2014, but it has\n2\n\n\fcontracted somewhat since then. The source of the decline is clear: New oil wells are counted as\nstructures, and oil producers have slashed capital spending in response to lower oil prices.\nLooking ahead, it seems clear that many businesses continue to identify profitable opportunities\nto install new capital. Corporate cash flows are strong and financing is readily available for an\narray of firms. I expect solid growth in overall business investment this year, despite the drag\nfrom energy sector spending.\nRounding out the domestic picture, government spending has subtracted from GDP growth since\nstimulus-related spending peaked right after the recession. More recently, growth in state and\nlocal tax revenues has fueled spending growth that has offset the drag on GDP growth from\ndeclining federal spending. The recent budget deal will provide a boost to federal spending this\nyear, however, and state and local spending in much of the country should continue to benefit\nfrom growing revenues.\nNet exports, on the other hand, are likely to subtract from growth this year as the trade deficit\nwidens. Many domestic producers now face stiffer competitive pressures from overseas, due to\nthe value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets having risen by over 20 percent in the last\nyear and a half.\nPutting all this together suggests that in the near term real GDP is likely to continue to grow at a\npace very close to the 2.2 percent rate we’ve seen since the end of the recession. Growth at that\nrate would generate strong employment gains and a further decline in unemployment. The\nunemployment rate is already fairly low, however, and arguably has reached a level consistent\nwith notions of longer-run maximum employment. As a result, we should expect growth in\nemployment and real GDP to start tapering off over the next year or two to a rate consistent with\ngrowth in the working age population of about a ½ percent per year. If productivity continues to\nadvance at about 1 ¼ percent per year, as it has during this expansion, that implies convergence\nto real GDP growth of around 1 ¾ percent.\nThe economic outlook is not complete until we discuss inflation. The FOMC’s 2 percent\ninflation target is based on a particular measure, the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditure, which is produced as a byproduct of the national income accounts that cover overall\neconomic activity. This measure has risen by only 0.4 percent over the 12 months that ended in\nNovember. Obviously, the major factor here is energy prices. The price of crude oil has fallen\nfrom over $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to $35 per barrel recently. The accompanying declines in\nthe prices of gasoline, heating oil and natural gas have held down headline inflation. Energy\nprices cannot register substantial declines forever, though, and in fact futures markets suggest an\nupward near-term trend.\nStripping the volatile energy and food components out of the overall price index yields the core\nprice index that often provides a better gauge of where overall inflation is likely to head. Core\ninflation has averaged 1.3 percent over the last 12 months, closer to the FOMC’s target. An\nimportant factor holding down core inflation has been the rise in the dollar on foreign exchange\nmarkets, which has reduced import prices.\n\n3\n\n\fIn short, inflation has been held down by two factors, the falling price of oil and the rising value\nof the dollar. But neither factor is likely to depress inflation indefinitely. After the price of oil\nbottoms out, I would expect to see headline inflation move significantly higher. And after the\nvalue of the dollar ultimately tops out, core inflation should move back toward 2 percent.\nMeasures of expected inflation from asset prices and surveys are consistent with that projection.\nThus I remain confident that, barring subsequent shocks, inflation will move back to the\nFOMC’s 2 percent objective over the near term.\nNow would be a good time to return to the question of how fast interest rates are likely to rise.\nAs I noted earlier, the pace is going to depend critically on the evolution of the economic outlook\nas we see the incoming data. If oil prices bottom out and the value of the dollar peaks, but\ninflation does not soon move back toward 2 percent, a shallower path for interest rates would\nmake sense. If inflation moves rapidly back toward 2 percent, however, a more aggressive path\nwould be in order.\nWhile there is uncertainty about the pace at which monetary policy rates will rise, the case for an\nupward adjustment in rates should be clear. One way to see the case is to look at real interest\nrates — that is, interest rates adjusted for expected inflation. The federal funds rate has been near\nzero for over seven years. A variety of measures indicate that over that time inflation has been\nexpected to trend back to 2 percent or higher. The difference — the funds rate minus expected\ninflation — is the real interest rate, and it has been negative for more than seven years.\nThis is an exceptional occurrence by historical standards. The way to understand this is to\nrecognize that a real interest rate is the price at which businesses and households can exchange\npurchasing power today for purchasing power in the future. This price should depend on the\nrelative supply of and demand for goods today and goods in the future. Low or even negative\nreal interest rates make sense when economic activity is weak, to encourage people to shift\nspending from the future to the present. Conversely, when economic activity is strong or growing\nrapidly, real interest rates ought to be higher. The current strength of U.S. economic growth,\nparticularly the robust growth in consumer spending, is a powerful argument for higher real\ninterest rates.\nApart from cyclical movements in real interest rates, however, there are longer-run swings in real\ninterest rates that policymakers need to take into account. The supply of and demand for savings\nand investment can shift noticeably over time in response to more gradual economic\ndevelopments.

            "content": "What Monetary Policy Can and Can’t Do\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCato Institute Monetary Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 12, 2015\n\nThank you for the opportunity to participate in this discussion on monetary policy and what it can and\ncan’t do. In thinking about this topic, it occurred to me that one side of the question – what it can’t do –\ngenerates a very long list. So for today’s discussion I intend to focus on the positive and discuss the one\nthing that I think we should be pretty certain monetary policy can indeed do, and that is to determine the\nlong-run path of the price level. Recent experience has caused some to question whether monetary\npolicy’s ability to achieve even this modest goal has diminished or been lost in the years since the Great\nRecession. I will argue that a central bank’s ability to influence inflation and how it does so is essentially\nunchanged. I also believe that monetary policy’s ability to affect inflation is essentially independent of its\neffects on real economic activity, which I view as limited and temporary. My view of what monetary\npolicy can do is based on the (perhaps old-fashioned) idea that money creation is at the heart of price\nlevel determination.\nAs I’m sure you know, it is standard practice for Federal Reserve officials in settings like this to begin\nwith a disclaimer, namely, that the views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve System or any other members of the Federal Open Market Committee.\nA Basic Framework\nI take as my starting point that monetary policy is uniquely capable of affecting the price level over the\nlonger term. Indeed, in the benchmark classical (or neoclassical) economic model without some form of\nfriction – in which money is neutral – the price level is all that monetary policy will affect. The price\nlevel, after all, is simply the rate of exchange between money and goods. So the quantity of money must\nbe related to how much of the latter each unit can buy. How to match the quantity of money in a\ntheoretical model to a particular empirical measure of money is not always straightforward. But the ability\nof monetary policy to affect the price level, or the rate of inflation, over time is a natural starting point and\none that is embedded in the FOMC’s statement concerning its long-term goals. 1\nIn contrast, monetary policy’s ability to affect real economic activity – when monetary policy is being\nreasonably well-executed – can be quite limited and is almost always short-lived. 2 Real activity is driven\npredominantly by factors beyond the control of monetary policy – productivity and population growth, for\nexample. In the standard models used in policy analysis, monetary policy’s real effects generally derive\nfrom frictions that impede the rapid adjustment of the overall level of the price. Such frictions are, almost\nalways, short-run phenomena that generate transitory deviations in real activity, and their empirical\nsignificance is a matter of ongoing research and debate. It is true that egregious monetary policy errors\ncan seriously damage the economy – for instance, by adding extraneous volatility and reducing the\ninformativeness of relative price signals. But in typical circumstances, monetary policy that successfully\nstabilizes inflation and inflation expectations will have only modest, temporary effects on real activity.\nThe mechanism through which monetary policy has its ultimate effect on the price level is through the\nprocess of money creation – that is, the process by which central bank actions affect the distinct forms of\n1\n\n\fmoney, such as bank deposits, that people use in transactions for goods and services. It is more common\nthese days to think of monetary policy as setting an interest rate target, rather than a money supply, in part\nbecause money demand seems to fluctuate significantly. 3 Nonetheless, prior to 2008 the Fed achieved its\ntarget for the federal funds rate – the price of overnight loan of reserves – by manipulating the supply of\nbank reserves. Reductions in the Fed’s interest rate target necessitated increases in the supply of bank\nreserves. The resulting money creation – by the central bank and the private banking system – in turn\ndrives price level determination.\nIf frictions in goods or financial markets impede price adjustment, then monetary policy may temporarily\naffect real economic activity along with the price level. In particular, a low interest rate policy will tend to\nstimulate real activity for a time. These effects can give rise to an empirical correlation between the\nobserved behavior of inflation and real economic activity. Such correlations are often referred to as the\nPhillips curve relationship – resource utilization or real activity positively correlated with inflation.\nIt is important to note, however, that the standard framework for understanding monetary policy\ntransmission is inconsistent with a popular interpretation of the Phillips curve, which is that a low interest\nrate raises inflation because the stimulation of real activity puts upward pressure on (real) resource costs.\nFor example, one sometimes hears that high rates of resource utilization lead to rising inflation. Or that an\nempirical breakdown in the Phillips curve relationship makes it harder for the Fed to bring inflation back\ntoward our 2 percent objective.\nThis reasoning is fundamentally flawed. Monetary policy does not affect inflation through its effect on\nreal activity. Monetary policy affects inflation and real activity simultaneously. If the relevant frictions\nare minimal, so that monetary policy has little effect on real activity, inflation is still driven directly by\nmonetary policy. So a weak Phillips curve relationship does not imply that monetary policy has any less\ninfluence over inflation.\nRecent Experience\nReconciling the behavior of monetary measures with the behavior of inflation has been more difficult\nsince the crisis. The dramatic increase in the Fed’s monetary liabilities after 2008 – from just under $1\ntrillion to over $4 trillion now – has led to dire warnings from some critics that surging inflation was\nimminent. That hasn’t happened. Inflation has not only failed to rise, but has been persistently low\nrelative to the FOMC’s stated goal of 2 percent. The last reading of 2 percent or greater for the 12-month\nchange in the personal consumption price index was in April 2012, and since 2013, the core index has\nfluctuated between 1.2 and 1.6 percent.\nIn fact, some argue that the zero lower bound on interest rates has been interfering with the Fed’s ability\nto keep inflation from falling. This is based on the idea, widely attributed to Swedish economist Knut\nWicksell, that keeping inflation close to our objective requires that the real short-term interest rate should\ntrack the economy’s underlying “natural” real rate of interest. 4 Because the Fed’s nominal interest rate\ntarget has been constrained by zero, policy might be disinflationary if the natural real rate has fallen\nsignificantly.\nThis hypothesis is more difficult to assess, because the natural real interest rate is not directly observable,\nand so independent measurements naturally depend on auxiliary assumptions and theories. At this point,\nthere is a fair amount of uncertainty around common estimates, but most estimates of the natural rate of\ninterest in the U.S. have clustered at or just above zero, well above the actual real funds rate, which has\nbeen running below negative 1. 5 So at this point, a Wicksellian perspective does not suggest that the zero\nlower bound is impeding the Fed’s ability to attain its 2 percent inflation objective. In fact, this\nperspective bolsters the case for raising the federal funds rate target now.\n2\n\n\fMoreover, the actual behavior of inflation in recent years does not warrant such pessimism. Statistically\nspeaking, inflation appears to have some slow-moving components, which allow it to stray sometimes for\nextended periods from its longer-run trend. In other words, inflation does not seem to behave as if each\nyear’s result is a roll of the dice, unconnected from last year’s experience. Given the historical behavior of\ninflation in recent decades – a period of time when the Fed is widely considered to have achieved stability\nof inflation and inflation expectations – an extended, one-sided deviation like the one we are currently\nexperiencing turns out to be not unlikely. 6 So I don’t think the recent behavior of inflation implies a more\npermanent departure from our target.\nThe persistent part of inflation has been modeled by some as a random walk component, which would\nseem to imply a process that is not well-anchored in the long run by the central bank’s objective. That is,\nit would seem to imply that inflation can drift permanently away from the central bank’s objective. But\nthis specification is hard to distinguish statistically from one in which inflation does move, perhaps\nslowly, toward a better anchored long-run expectation. 7 While a description like this pins down the\nlonger-run behavior of inflation, it leaves inflation at higher frequencies to move around, perhaps in\nresponse to a variety of relative price shocks.\nWith this statistical behavior, monetary policy’s ability to control inflation rests, in part, on its ability to\nstabilize longer-run inflation expectations. The Fed established credibility for long-term inflation, in the\nsense of stabilizing expectations, in the 1990s – the culmination of a process that began with the Volcker\ndisinflation in the early 1980s. And our available measures suggest that expectations have remained wellanchored for most of the period since the recession.\nWhile it is conceivable that the central bank could anchor expectations and the long-run behavior of\ninflation simply by stating a goal, it is more likely that the credibility of the goal depends on the public’s\nbelief that the central bank has and will use the tools necessary to make inflation return to its goal, should\nthat become necessary. So we should look again to the mechanism through which central bank actions\naffect money creation and ultimately the price level, taking into account how the monetary policy toolkit\nhas changed since the financial crisis.\nThe New Monetary Policy Environment\nThe second reason I am not pessimistic about the ability of monetary policy to ultimately control inflation\nhas to do with the mechanics of monetary policy. Allow me to explain. In the standard model, monetary\npolicy operations were premised on the actual arrangements in place prior to the financial crisis. The\nFederal Reserve controlled the quantity of its monetary liabilities, consisting of currency and bank\nreserves. Both were non-interest-bearing. The quantity demanded for each was a downward-sloping\nfunction of the short-term nominal interest rate. The Federal Reserve controlled the overall supply of its\nliabilities through open market operations in order to achieve a target level for the short-term interest rate,\nset by the Federal Open Market Committee. To lower rates, for example, the supply of monetary\nliabilities would be increased, making bank reserves less scarce.\nThis picture changed as a result of the crisis. Reserve account balances now earn explicit interest at a rate\nset by the Federal Reserve, and, as I noted earlier, the supply of bank reserves has increased dramatically.\nSo the mechanics of monetary policy are necessarily different from what they were in the decades before\nthe Great Recession.\nSome economists have argued that in the current regime, bank reserves are perfect substitutes for shortterm Treasury securities, and that as a result, monetary policy may be relatively impotent. 8 Open market\npurchases of U.S. Treasury securities are just exchanges of one liquid government liability for another.\n\n3\n\n\fFinancial institutions will simply hold fewer Treasury securities and more bank reserves, leaving\neconomic activity unaffected.\nThis neglects a key characteristic of bank reserves, however. While Treasury securities can be held by any\nfinancial entity, bank reserves can only be held by banks. 9 The banking system can shed other assets in\norder to accommodate larger reserve account balances, but there is an upper limit to this process. At some\npoint, banks would have to raise more capital in order to accommodate higher reserve account balances.\nThis would force broader changes in portfolios that would inevitably affect economic outcomes, including\nthe price level.\nRichmond Fed economist Huberto Ennis has provided an explicit model that captures this logic. 10 The\nintuition is that when the quantity of bank reserves is small enough and interest rates are above the\ninterest rate the central bank pays on excess reserves, then price level determination works the usual way.\nWhen the quantity of bank reserves is large enough, bank balance sheets are forced to adjust, and again,\nthe quantity of central bank liabilities directly affects the price level. In between, however, there is a\nbroad zone in which the quantity of bank reserves can vary without affecting the price level.\nThis basic story seems consistent with the difficulty of finding conclusive evidence of economic effects\nfrom the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases. It seems plausible that successive rounds of quantitative\neasing have had little or no tangible effect, apart from signaling regarding the FOMC’s outlook for future\neconomic growth and policy settings. At the same time, this framework implies that large enough asset\npurchases would compel changes in bank balance sheets that would in turn affect economic outcomes.\nThis analysis bolsters my confidence that the intuition of the standard approach remains relevant and\nmonetary policy still has the capacity to determine inflation and the price level over time.\nConcluding Remark\nTherefore, I continue to hold the view, as expressed in the FOMC’s statement of long-term goals, that\nmonetary policy has the unique ability to determine inflation over time. That ability is independent of\nwhether or not there is a reliable Phillips curve correlation. Moreover, it remains true in a world with\ninterest on reserves and large bank reserve account balances. The effect of monetary policy on real\nactivity, on the other hand, is likely to be transitory, which suggests caution in trying to use monetary\npolicy to have significant real effects over the medium term. Even more caution should apply, given the\nstate of our understanding, to the notion that monetary policy should respond to signals of incipient\nfinancial instability, an idea that has received considerable attention since the crisis. Conducting monetary\npolicy to achieve low and stable inflation over time, without doing damage to real activity, is hard\nenough.\n\n1\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy,” Adopted January 24, 2012, amended January 27, 2015.\n2\nMilton Friedman, “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, March 1968, vol. 58, no. 1, pp. 117.\n3\nMarvin Goodfriend, “Interest Rates and the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series\non Public Policy, Spring 1991, vol. 34, pp. 7-30.\n\n4\n\n\f4\n\nMichael Woodford, Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy, Princeton, N.J.: Princeton\nUniversity Press, 2003; Knut Wicksell, Interest and Prices: A Study of the Causes Regulating the Value of Money,\n1898, English translation, London: Macmillan and Company, 1936.\n5\nThomas A.

            "content": "Early Childhood Education in the Context of Lifetime Human Capital Investment\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nEarly Childhood Education Executive Briefing\nRichmond, Va.\nOctober 19, 2015\nThis speech was delivered by John Weinberg, special advisor to President Lacker.\nGood afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today on what is arguably one of the\nmost critical economic policy topics of all: the skills of our workforce. To set the stage, let me begin by\nexplaining why a Reserve Bank president might be interested in this topic. Part of our job at a regional\nFederal Reserve Bank is to understand how economic growth is unfolding in our region and in our\nnational economy more broadly. We hear regularly from our constituents and partners throughout our\nDistrict, which runs from Maryland down through South Carolina and includes almost all of West\nVirginia, that the long-run vitality of a community depends crucially on the skills of its people.\nEconomists, and increasingly others, refer to such skills as human capital. It has become apparent that\nhuman capital investment is a critical determinant of an economy’s longer-run potential. As\npolicymakers, we need to know whether investments in skills through education and work experience are\nmaking the most of the raw abilities that each new cohort of Americans brings with them. We at the\nRichmond Fed have found it useful to look at questions regarding early childhood education through the\nbroader lens of human capital investment. Before I discuss these ideas in more detail, I must note that the\nviews I express are my own and should not be attributed to anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nHuman Capital Investments\nThe human capital approach treats skills as one of many kinds of investments available to individuals: It\nviews skill acquisition as influenced by the associated payoffs or “returns.” It allows for these payoffs to\nbe monetary or nonmonetary (such as the pleasure we experience from learning or having an\nintellectually challenging job, for example). Furthermore, it suggests that human capital investments\nought to be “front loaded,” that is, occur primarily earlier rather than later in life. Investing early in\nhuman capital makes sense for three reasons. First, it provides a longer time horizon over which to reap\nthe rewards and recoup the cost of the investment. Second, investing late is costlier in terms of the\nforgone opportunities from spending time learning rather than earning, because earnings inevitably rise\nwith age and experience. Third, there is compelling evidence that “skills beget skills”: Early investments\nin human capital make later investments more productive. 2\nThis complementarity between early and later investments in human capital suggests that we ought to\nthink about early childhood education within the broader context of human capital investments that take\nplace later in life. Formal education is key among these, and substantial public funding is aimed at\nproviding the means and environs for people to acquire it. These include the universal availability of a\nfree public K-12 education and a highly subsidized public college system thereafter.\nLet me give you a sense of substantial scale of public support for education in the United States. Taken\ntogether, the expenditures of public elementary schools, secondary schools and degree-granting\npostsecondary institutions amount to 5.8 percent of GDP. 3 The level of spending is similar in most\ndeveloped nations, though the precise mix varies. Public elementary and secondary schools account for\ntwo-thirds of these expenditures. 4 This makes public school essentially free for all. Moreover, the\n1\n\n\fattendees of public K-12 schools, far from being disproportionately underprivileged, constitute a very\nbroad cross-section of American households. I will return to this point.\nHuman Capital Outcomes\nTo what extent has the widespread public provision of education given rise to cohorts ready for higher\neducation and the workplace? A brief glance at some summary measures suggests that we could do better.\nNationwide, about 20 percent of high school students fail to graduate within four years, with the number\nbeing as high as 40 percent in some large urban school districts. At public, four-year, degree-granting\ninstitutions, over 40 percent of enrollees fail to graduate within six years. 5\nAt the same time, our country appears to be experiencing what economists refer to as “skill-biased\ntechnical change” — the growing use of advanced technologies that increase the demand for skilled\nworkers. Yet our investments in human capital have not kept pace with this demand. After rising rapidly\nfor much of the 20th century, the average number of years Americans spend in school has leveled off and,\nsince the 1970s, has remained stubbornly stable at roughly 14 years. 6 The share of high school graduates\nwho immediately enroll in four-year college has remained constant around 42 percent since 2000. 7 But\nover the same period, college appears to have become an increasingly attractive proposition. The wages\nof college graduates (though not the wages of those with some years of college but no degree) have\nincreased steadily relative to the wages of those with just a high school education.\nThe fact that so many do not enroll despite a widening college wage premium has profound implications.\nFor one, it raises the possibility that those who do not currently enroll assess their odds of collegiate\nsuccess as low enough to outweigh the high returns associated with completing a degree. In other words,\nour K-12 education system is failing to respond to the increasing demand for college-ready graduates.\nIndeed, K-12 systems seem to have acknowledged this, and college readiness is becoming an area of\nfocus at high schools nationwide. 8 Interestingly, the emphasis placed by high schools on college readiness\nmay have the unintended consequence of discouraging students who view themselves as unlikely to\nattend college. If students believe the only reason to succeed in high school is to attend college, they, or\ntheir families, might not see much value in doing what is required to graduate from high school. This can\ncontribute to poor performance and high dropout rates in high school 9 and to the increasingly frequent\nreports we hear from employers that have trouble finding adequately prepared workers for jobs that do not\nrequire a college degree.\nWhat does all this mean for early childhood efforts? If students and their parents are aware of the limited\nability of their K-12 system to prepare them for college, or to provide them with useful skills when\ncollege is not their best option, they may be less likely to make the effort needed to leverage the benefits\nof early childhood education. One possible result is that the value of early childhood education may be\ndiluted or lost.\nThe last point drives home a theme I want to highlight: The ability of our K-12 educational system to help\npeople realize their potential will affect what results we can expect from earlier investments. This view\nrepresents the flip side of the familiar idea that early human capital investment improves the efficacy of\nlater educational investments. It also suggests that early childhood investments made in conjunction with\nwell-functioning systems in K-12 and beyond may be capable of yielding even greater payoffs than what\nresearch has uncovered so far. 10\n\n2\n\n\fChallenges Facing Early Childhood Education\nAnother important theme that emerges from the human capital literature is that human capital is\nmultidimensional: Any attribute or skill that rewards the individual contributes. Cognitive skills – that is,\nthe mental abilities that relate to learning, problem-solving and so on -- are an important part of an\nindividual’s human capital. Cognitive skills have been shown to be associated with positive outcomes in\nadulthood. But noncognitive skills, such as initiative and motivation, are also critical. Indeed, Nobel\nLaureate James Heckman and other scholars have argued that it is through the channel of noncognitive\nskills that early childhood interventions lead to better outcomes in adulthood. 11 Such skills make it\npossible for us to acquire more complex cognitive skills, and they also are critical for success in the labor\nmarket. Noncognitive skills, by their very nature, are harder to measure but, make no mistake, they are\nclearly relevant. For example, we routinely hear from employers and workforce development\nprofessionals around our District that a lack of “soft skills” is a major obstacle to hiring and employment.\nIt is also true, however, that the positive effects of early childhood interventions, especially on cognitive\noutcomes, may fade out over time. This appears to be true for both “model” programs, which are typically\nsmall, intensive, high-quality interventions, as well as for large-scale public programs such as Head\nStart. 12 An early study compared outcomes for children who participated in Head Start with those of their\nsiblings who did not. 13 The use of siblings allowed the researchers to study differences in outcomes that\nwere not attributable to family circumstances. The study found that while both white and AfricanAmerican students experienced gains in test scores initially, the gains for the latter group, but not the\nformer, diminished after they left the program. Subsequent research has confirmed these “fade-out”\neffects. 14 This suggests that human capital, like its physical counterpart, may “depreciate” in the absence\nof ongoing high-quality investment.\nThe challenge of fade-out may be related to the link between parental circumstances and K-12 school\nquality in the United States. The K-12 system here is heavily dependent on local economic conditions for\nfunding: Property taxes, on average, raise about 36 percent of all revenue needed to run public K-12\nschooling. 15 Not surprisingly, school districts with higher median incomes raise more revenue locally and,\ndespite attempts by state and federal funding to offset this, tend to spend more on instruction per student.\nBy contrast, in most other developed nations, this link is less strong and local property taxes less\nimportant. The Norwegian model of financing, for example, almost completely decouples parental\ncircumstances from the revenue collected within a school district. 16 This is an important point to bear in\nmind: Early childhood efforts in the United States must fight the headwind created by the prevailing\nmodel of school funding, something that they may not face elsewhere. Indeed, the correlation between\nschool funding and parental income might help explain why the gains from early childhood education\nappear less persistent for some student populations.\nAnother challenge is being able to provide quality early childhood education on a large scale. The most\nsuccessful programs tend to be those that are intensive and use highly trained personnel to target\nrelatively small groups of students. On the other hand, research on the effectiveness of large-scale\nprograms suggests that the gains from these programs tend to be smaller and less persistent. A recent\nstudy of Tennessee’s Voluntary Prekindergarten program has been widely cited for its negative findings:\nBy second grade, students who participated in the program actually performed worse than those who did\nnot. 17 The lessons of this study are still being investigated but we do know that, within other large scale\nprograms such as Head Start, more intensive interventions such as full-day service and frequent home\nvisits are associated with better outcomes. 18 This level of intensity would be costly to sustain in largescale programs, and so it follows that there must be a trade-off between the quality of the intervention and\nthe number of children that it reaches.\n\n3\n\n\fEncouraging a Lifetime of Human Capital Investment\nIf funding for early childhood education is going to be constrained, as seems likely to be the case over the\nmedium term, then I believe a case can be made for targeting resources to those for whom outcomes\nwould change the most. There is widespread agreement in the academic literature that disadvantaged\nstudents (for example, those coming from families with low incomes or parental education) experience\nthe greatest improvement in outcomes from early childhood interventions. Research has also found that\nsuch targeted spending is likely to have a larger effect on reducing the persistence of inequality across\ngenerations than broad-based spending. 19 It’s a good thing that some easily observable characteristics can\ntell us whose outcomes are likely to be benefited most by early childhood efforts, because it opens a path\nto setting eligibility requirements and judiciously targeting resources. Such targeting has in fact been a\nfeature of some early childhood investments. For example, the Minnesota Early Learning Scholarships\nProgram gives pre-school-aged children from low-income families access to early childhood education by\npaying scholarships directly to the program of their choice. From 2016 onward, the programs will be\nrequired to maintain a minimum rating to be eligible for funds. 20\nI also want to stress a more general principle that we need to keep in mind when thinking about the\nallocation of public funding, which is the importance of equalizing marginal societal benefits: The next\ndollar spent ought to yield society the same bang for its buck no matter how it is ultimately allocated. In\nessence, this principle provides a guide to balancing competing resource demands. I and many others\nhave long argued that a more balanced portfolio of educational spending would devote more resources to\nearly childhood education. The reason is that under current arrangements, the marginal return to\ninvestments in early childhood appear to be large relative to other educational expenditures.\nFinally, at the beginning of my remarks I discussed the idea that human capital investments at various\nstages of life are complementary. This idea also has important implications for what an appropriately\nbalanced portfolio of education spending looks like. The evidence suggests that investments in early\nchildhood can increase the effectiveness of human capital investments made later in life. Conversely,\ninvestments in K-12 education will also increase the long-term payoff to early childhood investments.\nIn conclusion, I should note that while what we have learned so far clearly underscores the power of early\nchildhood education, even more remains to be learned about the interplay of forces that determine its\nultimate efficacy. I’ll leave you with the idea that we can only unlock the full transformative potential of\nearly childhood education in the context of effective human capital investment in K-12 and beyond.\nThank you for your attention.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Kartik Athreya, Nika Lazaryan, Urvi Neelakantan and Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing\nthese remarks.\n2\nSee, for example, Flavio Cunha and James Heckman, \"The Technology of Skill Formation,\" American Economic\nReview, May 2007, vol. 97, no. 2, pp. 31-47.\n3\nNational Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics, 2014, Tables 106.10 and 106.20.\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2014menu_tables.asp.\n4\nNational Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics, 2014, Tables 106.10 and 106.20.\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2014menu_tables.asp.\n5\nIbid, Graduation Rates, https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40.\n6\nClaudia Goldin and Lawrence F.

Household spending, which has grown steadily since the recession, has accelerated in the last\ncouple of years. Labor market conditions have steadily improved as well and have tightened considerably this year. With the\nfederal funds rate near zero and inflation running between 1 and 2 percent, real (inflation-adjusted) short-term interest\nrates are below negative 1 percent. Such exceptionally low real interest rates are unlikely to be appropriate for an economy\nwith persistently strong consumption growth and tightening labor markets.\n“Inflation has run somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in recent years and was held down late last year by\ndeclining oil prices and appreciation of the dollar. Since January, however, inflation has been very close to 2 percent.\nMovements in oil prices and the value of the dollar in recent weeks have renewed downward pressure on inflation. As with\nlast year’s episode, this disinflationary impulse is likely to be transitory. So I remain confident that inflation will move back to\nthe FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n“A higher interest rate under current conditions is also consistent with the way the FOMC has responded to economic\nconditions and inflation over the last few decades. This historical pattern of behavior has conditioned public beliefs about\nhow the FOMC is likely to behave in the future, and it has been an essential foundation for the monetary stability we\n\n\fcurrently enjoy. Further delay would be a departure from a pattern of behavior that has served us well in the past. The\nhistorical record strongly suggests that such departures are risky and raise the likelihood of adverse outcomes.\n“For these reasons, I supported raising the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. Interest\nrates have been near zero for over six years. Even after a quarter-point increase, interest rates would remain exceptionally\nlow, providing ample support for economic growth. This expansion has been disappointing by some measures, when\ncompared to historical averages. Nevertheless, U.S. economic conditions have improved quite significantly over the last six\nyears, all things considered. It’s time to recognize the substantial progress that has been achieved and align rates\naccordingly.\n“I recently expressed my views in a speech to the Richmond Retail Merchants Association titled The Case Against Further\nDelay. My views on the economy and monetary policy are also available on richmondfed.org.”\nAs part of our nation’s central bank, the Richmond Fed is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks working together with the Board of\nGovernors to support a healthy economy and deliver on our mission to foster economic stability and strength. We connect with\ncommunity and business leaders across the Fifth Federal Reserve District — including the Carolinas, District of Columbia,\nMaryland, Virginia, and most of West Virginia — to monitor economic conditions, address issues facing our communities, and\nshare this information with monetary and financial policymakers.

            "content": "The Case Against Further Delay\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nRetail Merchants Association Economic Forecast Breakfast\nRichmond, Va.\nSeptember 4, 2015\nGood morning, and thank you for inviting me to speak with you. I think it’s fair to say that the\nsubject of my remarks today, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy, has received relatively\nprominent media attention in recent months. But the current setting of the Fed’s policy rate dates\nback to the end of 2008, when the financial turmoil was worsening and the recession was\ndeepening. That’s when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) set a target range for the\nfederal funds rate of between zero and 25 basis points. With short-term interest rates reduced to\nnear zero and inflation of at least 1 percent since then, real, inflation-adjusted interest rates have\nbeen negative for the better part of six years.\nFollowing other recent recessions, the Fed has typically raised interest rates within a few quarters\nof the end of the contraction in economic activity. 1 In contrast, the Great Recession ended in the\nsecond quarter of 2009, and while many initially expected rates to rise again within a couple of\nyears, we are now entering the seventh year of what seems like an epic waiting game.\nThe title of my talk today is “The Case Against Further Delay.” As that title suggests, I plan to\nreview the main reasons to begin raising rates sooner rather than later. As you may know, the\nFOMC is scheduled to meet the week after next, and I expect the Committee to consider fully\nboth the arguments for and against further delay. Earlier this year I said publicly that I thought\nthe case for raising rates was strong, and I still think that’s true. But I should emphasize that I\nwill not make a final decision on the question until I have had the benefit of discussions with my\ncolleagues at the upcoming meeting and have reviewed the additional data we will receive\nbetween now and then. I should also emphasize that, as always, I am speaking for myself and the\nviews expressed are not the official views of the FOMC. 2\nConsumer Spending Has Accelerated\nIn my view, the most significant facts supporting an interest rate increase are related to\nhousehold expenditures. As I’m sure a room full of retailers is well aware, consumer spending\nplays a major role in our economy, constituting more than two-thirds of our nation’s GDP.\nFollowing the end of the recession, growth in real personal consumption expenditures was\nrelatively slow as households repaired their balance sheets while coping with weak labor\nmarkets. After an initial post-recession rebound, consumer spending growth averaged less than 2\npercent at an annual rate for several years. In 2014, however, household spending accelerated,\naveraging over 3 percent for the year, only to fall back to a slower pace early this year. But that\nfirst quarter slowdown now seems largely attributable to temporary factors, such as unusually\nsevere winter weather in many areas of the country. Spending growth has picked up again since\nthen, growing at a 3.1 percent annual rate over the last three months.\n\n1\n\n\fHousehold spending growth is fueled by household income growth, both current and anticipated,\nand real income has registered significant gains since the end of the recession, driven in part by\nsteady employment growth since 2011. I’ll have more to say about jobs in a few minutes, but let\nme just say now that I believe improvements in the labor market are likely to continue to fuel\nhealthy growth in consumer spending at between 2 ½ and 3 percent per year.\nWhat is the link between consumer spending growth and monetary policy? As I noted at the\noutset, with the federal funds rate near zero and inflation running between 1 percent and 2\npercent, real short-term interest rates — that is, inflation-adjusted interest rates — have been\nnegative for most of the past six years. Conceptually, the real interest rate is the price at which\npeople can exchange purchasing power today for purchasing power in the future. This price\nshould depend of the relative supply of and demand for goods today and goods in the future. In\ngeneral, this suggests a connection between real interest rates and the expected growth of\nconsumption of goods and services: Higher growth should be associated with higher real rates.\nWhile this connection isn’t always tight in the data, the logic strongly suggests that a negative\nreal interest rate is unlikely to be appropriate for an economy with persistent consumption\ngrowth at the rate we are now seeing.\nSome economists argue that a secular downward trend is affecting real interest rates, driven by\nlower productivity growth and increased demand for the safety of U.S. Treasury securities. As a\nresult, they say, we should expect lower average real interest rates in the immediate future and\nmonetary policymakers should take this into account. For example, some argue that we should\nrevise our estimate of a key parameter (sometimes referred to as the “natural rate of interest” or\nthe “equilibrium rate of interest”) in some of the simple algebraic formulas that are often used as\nbenchmarks to inform contemporaneous monetary policy settings. 3 Because these formulas\nsummarize the historical conduct of monetary policy and because our credibility depends on\nexpectations that we will continue to conduct policy in a way that maintains price stability,\ndeviating from the behavior pattern encapsulated in these simple formulas can be particularly\nrisky. While the possibility of longer-run swings in macroeconomic variables needs to be taken\nseriously, for me the evidence in this case is not yet compelling enough to warrant setting aside\nconsiderations that would otherwise prescribe raising rates.\nOther components of GDP are showing healthy growth as well: Like consumer spending,\nbusiness investment spending weakened around the beginning of this year, but recent reports\nindicate that capital goods orders appear to have bottomed out last spring and have increased\nsince then, and nonresidential construction spending has registered strong gains as well. These\nreports suggest that business investment is likely to contribute positively to growth going\nforward.\nResidential investment has registered healthy gains this year. Housing starts year to date (through\nJuly) were up 11 percent over the previous year. Even though the rate of home building is rising\nfrom relatively low post-recession levels and is unlikely to return soon to a torrid pre-recession\npace, the housing market has been making noticeable contributions to growth.\nLabor Markets Have Tightened\nEarlier this year, as it began to prepare the public for an eventual rise in interest rates, the FOMC\nsaid it was looking for “further improvements in the labor market” before an increase in interest\n2\n\n\frates would be appropriate. Those improvements have materialized: So far this year, the\neconomy has produced an average of 213,000 net new jobs per month and the unemployment\nrate has fallen to 5.3 percent. 4\nI should note that these numbers pertain to July; the August employment report is due to be\nreleased at 8:30 this morning. While there is always a chance that this morning’s report is\nunexpectedly weak, it’s quite unlikely that a one-month blip would materially alter the labor\nmarket picture or, for that matter, the monetary policy outlook. After all, more than 12 million\njobs have been added since the trough in payroll employment in early 2010.\nThese national statistics indicate a significant tightening in labor markets has taken place over\nthe last year and a half. That conclusion is supported by the anecdotal information we have been\nreceiving from our contacts within the Fifth Federal Reserve District. Over the last year or so,\nreports of difficulty finding and hiring qualified workers have become notably more widespread\nand persistent.\nYou’ll notice that I cited the number of “net” new jobs. While that’s a critical statistic, the\noverall number masks a significant amount of activity; every day, thousands of workers leave\ntheir current jobs or start new jobs, and thousands of employers lay people off or create new\nvacancies. This “churn” is an important characteristic of dynamic labor markets, as has been\nemphasized in research by Stephen Davis and John Haltiwanger. 5 The measures that capture\nthese flows in the labor market have all been strong as well: Year over year, vacancies are up 11\npercent, the hiring rate is up 7 percent and the rate at which workers voluntarily leave their jobs,\na signal of workers’ confidence in their job market prospects, is up 11 percent.\nThe unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, has fallen more rapidly\nthan many people expected. That decline has been accompanied by a large decline in labor force\nparticipation — roughly 3 percentage points since the end of the recession, a steep drop by\nhistorical standards. 6 Some observers have been concerned that the many people who have left\nthe labor force represent a significant amount of “slack” beyond what is captured in the\ntraditional unemployment rate, and that these underutilized labor resources could easily be drawn\nback into the labor force. Those who are concerned also point to the number of people working\npart time who would prefer to work full time. A broader measure of unemployment that includes\nthese part-time workers, plus people who have recently left the labor force but would like to be\nworking, was 10.4 percent in July, well above the official unemployment rate of 5.3 percent.\nBut most of the people who have left the labor force are not currently looking for work. The\ndecline in labor force participation has been driven mainly by structural and demographic\nfactors, such as the growing number of people enrolling in college and the large baby boom\ngeneration reaching retirement age. 7 In addition, research indicates that not all people without a\njob have the same propensity to return to work. For example, Richmond Fed researchers have\nconstructed a broader measure of underutilization they call a “nonemployment index.” This\nindex counts all people who are not working, not just those who are unemployed according to the\nofficial definition, and weights them differently based on their likelihood of becoming employed\nin the future. For example, unemployed people who are actively looking for work are about three\ntimes more likely to become employed than people who say they would like to find a job but are\nnot actively seeking one. Their research demonstrates that while there is more slack than is\ncaptured by the official unemployment rate, there seems to be no more now than is usual when\n3\n\n\fthe unemployment rate is around 5.3 percent. 8 In other words, the official unemployment rate is\nproviding a reasonably accurate guide to how the utilization of labor resources has changed over\ntime.\nMeasures of slack or underutilization are often compared against a normative benchmark, that is,\nsome assessment of what a normal amount of slack would be. Such an assessment takes into\naccount that there will always be some people who have left the labor force because they’re\ndiscouraged about the likelihood of finding a job, or who can only find part-time work even\nthough they’d like to be working full time. Such an assessment should also take into account the\nconsiderable uncertainty about what exactly constitutes normal at the present time. Economists\nhave taken a range of different approaches to estimating the level of the relevant benchmark,\nwhich of course is not directly observable. My sense is that the current unemployment rate is\nstatistically indistinguishable from plausible normative benchmarks, such as estimates of “full\nemployment” or “the natural rate of unemployment.”\nSome argue there must be excessive slack in labor markets if wage rates are not accelerating. But\nreal wages are tied to productivity growth, and productivity growth has been slow for several\nyears now. Wage growth in real terms has at least kept pace with productivity increases over that\ntime period, which is perfectly consistent with an economy from which labor market slack has\nlargely dissipated.\nOverall, I believe the evidence indicates that labor market conditions no longer warrant\ncontinuation of exceptionally low interest rates.\nWhat About Our Inflation Goal?\nAlthough it is easy to overlook, given the intense focus on labor markets in recent years, the\nFederal Reserve, as our nation’s central bank, is responsible for controlling inflation. At the\nbeginning of 2012, the FOMC announced an explicit long-run inflation goal of 2 percent,\nconfirming what had been widely viewed as our implicit target. Inflation has been below that\ngoal by varying amounts since the middle of 2012. Since January, however, the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures — our preferred inflation measure — has grown at an\naverage annual rate of 2.2 percent. The core index, which excludes the more volatile food and\nenergy components, has grown at an average rate of 1.7 percent. (You may have heard that\ninflation over the 12 months ending in July was 0.3 percent, but that 12-month span included the\nperiod from July 2014 to January 2015 in which inflation averaged negative 1.5 percent.) These\nnumbers, which have been seasonally adjusted by the U.S. Department of Commerce, provide\nstrong evidence that the transitory effects of last year’s energy prices and exchange rates are\nbehind us.\nThe second condition the FOMC laid out for raising interest rates was that it would have to be\n“reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium\nterm.” The last half year of data show that inflation already has returned to our 2 percent\nobjective. Thus both conditions that the FOMC stated earlier this year would make it appropriate\nto raise the target range for the federal funds rate appear to have been met.\nThe return of inflation to 2 percent should not be surprising. First, the deviation from the\ncommittee’s inflation goal during the past few years was not especially large. Research by\n4\n\n\feconomists at the San Francisco Fed and the Richmond Fed suggests that the deviation is not\nstatistically significant once you factor in the volatility of monthly inflation rates. The fact that\nwe have undershot our inflation goal could easily be the result of bad luck, rather than a\nsystematic failure of monetary policy in pursuit of its target. 9\nSecond, our best measures of inflation expectations have held reasonably steady at rates\nconsistent with inflation returning to the FOMC’s goal. Survey measures have remained within\nthe narrow bands within which they have fluctuated for some time. While measures derived from\nU.S. Treasury securities — the so-called TIPS inflation compensation figures — have declined\nof late, they are not unusually low and could well be dampened by movements in the premium\ninvestors place on the superior liquidity of nominal Treasury securities.\nAs a result, I believe we can be reasonably confident that inflation will continue to gravitate to 2\npercent as long as we do not depart from conducting monetary policy in a manner consistent with\ncontinued expectations of price stability.\nShould the Recent Financial Market Volatility Give Us Pause?\nNo discussion of macroeconomic conditions at this moment would be complete without mention\nof recent financial market volatility. Developments in China appeared to have heightened\nuncertainty regarding future economic growth and macroeconomic policy there, which seems to\nhave prompted higher financial market volatility in developed market economies. At times of\nmarket turbulence one must maintain a deep respect for the divergent ways in which events\ncould conceivably unfold, and thus I will not pretend I can foretell the future.\nNevertheless, it is worth observing that the direct implications of recent developments for\neconomic fundamentals in the United States appear to be quite limited. If so, then recent market\ndevelopments will have only limited implications for the appropriate path of monetary policy.\nThis might seem to contradict widespread conjecture about the Fed delaying liftoff due to market\nturbulence. But I would point out that the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market\nmovements that seem unconnected to economic fundamentals. The events of 1998-99 are a case\nin point, when financial developments in emerging markets generated substantial U.S. market\nvolatility despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth. The FOMC cut rates three\ntimes but ended up taking back those cuts the following year.\nIs Now the Time?\nAfter the FOMC reduced interest rates to near zero, we included qualitative language indicating\nthat we thought exceptionally low interest rates would be appropriate “for some time,” and then\nfor “an extended period.” In August 2011, the FOMC altered this “forward guidance” language\nto specify a date before which an increase in the federal funds rate was unlikely. The date was\nmoved forward several times thereafter, eventually stating that low rates were likely until mid2015. At the end of 2012, this date-based forward guidance was replaced with a statement that\nthe Committee anticipated that low rates would be appropriate “at least as long as the\nunemployment rate remains above” a threshold of 6.5 percent. The FOMC also stated at the time\nthat this guidance was consistent with previous, date-based guidance — that is, with low rates\npersisting at least until mid-2015. 10\n\n5\n\n\fSo here we are, just past mid-2015, with robust employment growth and an unemployment rate\nthat has fallen rapidly over the past few years — more rapidly than many people expected — and\nis now more than a full percentage point below the committee’s forward guidance threshold. 11\nMoreover, inflation is arguably running just above the FOMC’s objective of 2 percent, not\nbelow.\nSome might argue that as long as inflation is close to 2 percent we have a free pass — we can\nkeep supporting the real side of the economy with low rates until inflation rises. But if, as I’ve\nargued, the real side of the economy calls for a higher interest rate, then there is a real danger\nassociated with this strategy. Inflation is a lagging indicator, and the forces that lead to rising\ninflation can build up before they are apparent in the data. We saw this in the mid-1960s, when\ninflation began increasing after six years of holding steady around 1 percent. Policymakers kept\ninterest rates low in pursuit of low unemployment, in the belief that the unemployment rate\nconsistent with full employment was lower than modern research has shown that it was at the\ntime. 12 This set off the period known as the “Great Inflation,” which lasted until the early 1980s\nand was quite difficult and painful to reverse. 13 Waiting too long to begin raising rates could\nrequire a more dramatic increase in rates to restrain inflation pressures once they have become\napparent in the data.\nThe case for raising interest rates that I have described has actually been true for some time; I\ncould have made the same arguments in June, or even April. But I’ve been willing to wait so far\nthis year. In part, that’s because the FOMC conditioned the public not to expect liftoff before\nJune, and deviating from the expectations we’ve actively fostered should require a significant\ndeparture from the economic conditions we anticipated, which hasn’t occurred. In contrast, the\nCommittee has been clear since June that an increase is possible at any remaining meeting this\nyear.\nI was also willing to wait for confirmation that the factors holding down real growth and\ninflation late last year and early this year were transitory. It is now clear that those factors, which\nincluded harsh winter weather, the strengthening dollar, and the steep decline in energy prices,\nhave dissipated. It was not unreasonable to seek more definitive evidence that these impediments\nto growth and price stability had passed, but that question has now been settled.\nProgress has been slow and uneven, but the economy has worked its way back from the\ndislocations of the Great Recession.

            "content": "From Country Banks to SIFIs: The 100-year Quest for Financial Stability\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nLouisiana State University Graduate School of Banking\nBaton Rouge, Louisiana\nMay 26, 2015\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you this evening. You have an exciting and informative\nweek ahead of you, and I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of it. I know I don’t have to\nconvince this audience of the importance of financial intermediation to our economy and the\nimportance of banks in particular as intermediaries. But the banking industry has come under\nharsh scrutiny since the financial crisis of 2007-08. Numerous instances of government support\nfor investors, particularly the creditors of large financial institutions, sparked a popular backlash\nthat helped shape the legislative response to the crisis. Significant changes in the regulatory\nlandscape have been taking place as well, driven by a desire to improve financial stability and\naddress the problem of financial firms perceived as “too big to fail.”\nThe pervasiveness of this problem is illustrated by the size of — and the growth in — the federal\nfinancial safety net, by which I mean the portion of the financial sector’s liabilities protected\nfrom loss by the federal government. This includes both explicit guarantees of protection, such as\ndeposit insurance, and implicit guarantees, which represent the support investors expect based on\nprior government intervention and announced policy. In 2013, the value of the liabilities covered\nby the safety net was nearly $26 trillion, more than one and a half times our country’s entire\nannual gross domestic product. That represents fully 60 percent of the financial sector’s\nliabilities. In 1965, the value of the assets protected by the safety net was less than half of GDP.\nThese estimates were calculated by Richmond Fed researchers, who have developed a so-called\n“bailout barometer” to monitor the growing safety net. 1\nThe story of how we created this alarming situation spans more than 100 years and reflects a\nseries of decisions made in the pursuit of financial stability. But those decisions have distorted\nthe incentives of financial market participants to monitor and control risk and arguably have\nmade our financial system less stable. Instances of government intervention during times of\ndistress have reinforced creditors' expectations of support and dampened incentives to contain\nrisk-taking. This has promoted financial firms of greater size, complexity and\ninterconnectedness, and it has encouraged greater leverage and more reliance on highly liquid\nshort-term funding. Perceived guarantees thus encourage fragility, which induces interventions,\nwhich encourages further fragility. The ultimate result of this cycle is taxpayer-funded subsidies\nto financial firms that are widely viewed as deeply unfair.\nToday, regulators and policymakers are strengthening supervision and regulation, motivated by\nthe understandable desire to prevent another crisis like the one we experienced in 2007 and 2008.\nBut regulation alone is not likely to be enough to counteract the moral hazard afflicting such a\nlarge — and growing — share of the financial sector’s liabilities. Instead, we should work to\nrestore market discipline and thereby solve the fundamental problem at the heart of “too big to\n1\n\n\ffail.” Before I talk about this strategy in more detail, I should note that these are my own views\nand not the views of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 2\nThe Origins of “Too Big to Fail”\nTo understand the origins of the modern “too big to fail” problem, it’s important to understand\nsome features of the banking system around the turn of the 20th century. First, the industry was\nhighly fragmented. Branching restrictions meant that essentially every town had its own small\nbank, to the tune of more than 27,000 banks in the United States in the early 1900s. 3 These small\nbanks were highly vulnerable to local economic shocks, and banks were unable to diversify risks\nacross regions or head off bank runs by moving funds between branches.\nSecond, issuing currency was a very cumbersome process. As a result of the National Banking\nActs of 1863 and 1864, currency had to be backed by certain U.S. government bonds. This meant\nthat in order for a bank to issue new notes, it would have to purchase the appropriate bonds,\ndeposit those bonds with the U.S. Treasury, wait for Treasury to authorize printing the notes, and\nthen wait for the notes to be printed and shipped. The entire process could take as long as three\nweeks from request to delivery. 4 This made it difficult for banks to supply enough currency\nduring seasonal increases in demand, such as the fall harvest or the holiday shopping seasons.\nBanks also struggled to provide enough currency during the banking panics that often\naccompanied economic downturns, when many people would rush to withdraw their deposits at\nthe same time.\nThe country banks (as banks outside major cities were called) were connected to city banks via\nan intricate web of correspondent banks, and city banks were connected to each other via\nclearinghouses. This system made it possible to clear and settle check payments and distribute\ncurrency nationwide. But it also meant that strains could spread quickly from city banks to\ncountry banks, and vice versa. When these strains developed into full-blown financial crises, the\ncountry banks often found themselves cut off when clearinghouses restricted the supply of\nliquidity to the country banks in order to protect clearinghouse members in the city. The result\nwas frequent spikes in interest rates and sometimes, when the demand for notes was particularly\nacute, the suspension of payments to depositors. 5\nThe Panic of 1907 was the last straw for many people, and the banking reform movement\neventually resulted in the Federal Reserve, which was established in 1913 to “furnish an elastic\ncurrency,” that is, to provide a supply of bank notes that readily expanded and contracted with\nthe needs of the economy. The new central bank also was intended to increase the viability of\ncountry banks by preventing their isolation during times of financial distress.\nThe system functioned smoothly for more than a decade, but then, between 1929 and 1933, more\nthan one-third of the country's roughly 25,000 banks failed. Entire states declared bank holidays,\nfollowed by the declaration of a nationwide bank holiday in March 1933. 6 Depositor losses and\nthe disturbances in the payment system were enormously disruptive.\nOne popular account of this episode holds that the crisis was caused by self-fulfilling depositor\npanic: Fearing failure, people rushed to withdraw their funds, thus ensuring that failure occurred.\n2\n\n\fBut modern scholarship has concluded that the crisis was in fact the result of shocks to the\nsolvency of the banking system. The Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to collapse, and\nthe severe deflation that resulted — a 28 percent decline in average prices over three years —\ndrove many bank borrowers into default. Bank runs contributed to the decline in the money\nstock, but the Fed could have offset the effects through open market purchases of securities. 7\nThese shocks were then exacerbated by the fragmented nature of the banking system. 8 The most\nstriking evidence for this is the contrasting case of Canada, which experienced similar economic\nshocks but whose banking laws allowed consolidation. As a result, there were no serious banking\npanics, despite the lack of a central bank. 9\nLegislators were well aware that branching restrictions contributed to banking panics, but the\nunit banking system was defended by politically influential populist and agrarian groups. These\nforces lobbied instead for a system of government-provided deposit insurance that would\npreserve small local banks by protecting their depositors. Although there was significant\nopposition to the idea of deposit insurance, its supporters prevailed and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) came into being in 1933.\nThe obvious drawback to deposit insurance is that it creates moral hazard: Bankers have an\nincentive to make riskier investments, and depositors have less incentive to monitor the risktaking behavior of their banks. 10 We saw these incentive problems come to a head during the\nsavings and loan crisis of the 1980s, when hundreds of federally insured savings and loan\ninstitutions failed, bankrupting the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and costing\ntaxpayers an estimated $124 billion. 11 While many factors contributed to the savings and loan\ndebacle, it is unlikely that it could have reached the proportions it did without the distorted\nincentives created by federal deposit insurance. 12\nChoosing Financial Fragility\nIn 1913, policymakers adopted a structure for the Fed that was intended, through its lending\nauthority, to protect small country banks from being cut off in times of stress. Two decades later,\npolicymakers chose to create a safety net for an industry made up of many small banks rather\nthan allow larger, more diversified banks. The great irony of both these decisions is that while\nthey were motivated by a desire to protect the viability of small banks, they actually laid the\ngroundwork for banks perceived as “too big to fail.” 13\nThat irony became apparent in the 1970s, when the Fed and the FDIC began to intervene in\ncredit markets in ways that protected uninsured creditors of large financial firms. Prominent\nexamples include the Penn Central railroad in 1970,* 14 the Bank of the Commonwealth in 1972,\nand Franklin National Bank in 1974. 15 Then in 1984, Continental Illinois — a failing $40 billion\nbank — was able to borrow from the discount window even as it was receiving a capital\ninjection from the FDIC. During congressional hearings on the Continental Illinois failure, the\ncomptroller of the currency went so far as to admit that 11 other U.S. banks were large enough to\nwarrant being bailed out should they become insolvent. 16 By the mid-1980s, financial market\nparticipants had good reason to expect uninsured creditors of large institutions would be\ninsulated from losses by the government.\n\n3\n\n\fIn the 1990s, banks finally were allowed to branch both within states and across state lines. 17\nThey grew very rapidly: In 1990, the sum of the assets of the four largest banks was equivalent\nto less than 10 percent of GDP, according to calculations by Richmond Fed economists. By\n2008, their assets equaled more than 40 percent of GDP, and the ratio has declined only slightly\nsince then. Size in and of itself isn’t necessarily a concern; there are inherent benefits to scale\nand scope. But the restraints on size were lifted only after federal regulators had established\nexpectations of intervention, and those expectations served as an artificial accelerant for bank\ngrowth. The speed with which the largest institutions grew made it difficult for their\nmanagement and governance structures to keep up with the increasingly risky activities they\nwere engaged in.\nThe onset of the most recent financial crisis presented policymakers with a new set of choices —\nand once again we chose rescue, this time in the form of special Fed lending facilities and direct\nsupport for many firms. The guiding principle behind these actions, and others that followed,\nwas that credit markets were malfunctioning and the remedy was additional central bank lending.\nArguably, however, these measures reinforced market participants’ expectations that the Fed and\nthe FDIC were standing by, ready to rescue the creditors of financial institutions that showed\nsigns of distress.\nThe legacy of these policy choices, and of others we’ve made over the past century, is the large\nand growing financial safety net I mentioned at the outset. The rise in implicit protections has\nbeen especially dramatic. In 1965, virtually all of the guarantees provided by the safety net were\nexplicit, such as deposit insurance. Today, more than 40 percent of the guarantees are implicit,\naccording to Richmond Fed estimates — created through the precedents of discretionary\ninterventions.\nThese implied commitments regarding future interventions distort the incentives of banks and\ntheir counterparties. They also create an uneven competitive playing field in the banking\nindustry. Absent regulatory distortions, we would hope to see firms of different sizes competing\nbased on their natural advantages. But the choices we’ve made in the pursuit of financial stability\nmean we cannot presume that any advantages enjoyed by large banks are purely the result of\ncomparative advantages or underlying economies of scale. There may be other aspects of our\nregulatory regime that cut in the opposite direction, but overall, we appear to have created a\nbanking industry in which the slope of the competitive playing field depends more on policy\ninterventions than on the relative value banks create for their customers.\nCommitting to Financial Stability\nSo far, I’ve told you what’s wrong. But what can we do about it? One option is more regulation,\nsuch as the Dodd Frank Act’s greater capital buffer requirements and ex-ante constraints on risktaking. But new opportunities for risk-taking will always emerge as financial markets and\neconomies evolve, and it is asking too much to expect front-line supervisors to forever stand in\nfor well-aligned incentives. Moreover, stronger constraints on risk-taking increase the incentive\nfor market participants to find a way to operate outside the regulated sector. Expanding\nregulation to chase down fragility wherever it appears is not a promising strategy. And the\n\n4\n\n\fincreasingly complex regulatory regime can have the side effect of overburdening smaller banks,\nfurthering their disadvantage relative to the biggest banks.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also established the Orderly Liquidation Authority, or OLA, which gives\nthe FDIC the ability, with the agreement of other financial regulators, to wind down a large\nfinancial institution using funds borrowed from the U.S. Treasury. The authors of the Act\nenvisioned the OLA as a way to put an end to taxpayer-funded bailouts. However, the FDIC’s\nannounced plans for implementation will likely encourage many creditors to expect they will\nbenefit from the FDIC’s discretion, dampening their incentive to contain risk. If expectations of\nsupport for the creditors of financially distressed institutions are widespread, regulators will\nlikely feel forced to provide support to these short-term creditors to avoid the turbulence of\ndisappointing expectations. Rather than ending “too big to fail,” the OLA replicates the dynamic\nthat created it.\nThe long-term solution is not more regulation. Instead, it’s to restore market discipline so that\nfinancial firms and their creditors have an incentive to avoid fragile funding arrangements. Two\nconditions are necessary to achieve this. First, creditors must not expect government support in\nthe event of financial distress. Second, policymakers must actually allow financial firms to fail\nwithout government support. If we can make unassisted failures manageable, policymakers could\ncredibly commit to forgoing rescues, thereby improving private sector incentives.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act lays out a path toward making bankruptcy workable for large financial\ninstitutions. The Act requires these institutions to create resolution plans, also known as “living\nwills.” 18 These are detailed plans that explain how a financial institution could be wound down\nunder U.S. bankruptcy laws without threatening the rest of the financial system or requiring\ngovernment assistance. The plans explain how to disentangle the many different legal entities —\nsometimes numbering in the thousands — that make up a large financial firm. Under the DoddFrank Act, large banks and other “systemically important” firms, also known as SIFIs, are\nrequired to submit these plans on an annual basis for review by the Fed and the FDIC.\nResolution planning wisely does not take the current operating profile of large financial firms as\ngiven; the current characteristics of these firms evolved in response to the precedents set by\nregulators avoiding the use of bankruptcy. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that if the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC jointly determine that a plan would not credibly facilitate an orderly\nresolution under the Bankruptcy Code, the firm is required to submit a revised plan to address\nidentified deficiencies. If the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not\nremedy identified deficiencies, they can require more capital, increase liquidity requirements or\nrestrict the growth, activities or operations of the firm. They can even require firms to make\ndivestitures.\nThe needed alterations to the structure and operations of large financial firms will be unpopular\nsince they are likely to involve reductions in reliance on short-term funding and the adoption of\nmore easily severable subsidiary structures. But I believe the changes that could result from\nliving wills are feasible without sacrificing the inherent benefits large financial firms provide to\nthe economy. The credibility of living wills would be compromised, in my view, by continuing\nto depend on government backstops in order to avoid needed changes.\n5\n\n\fA final step may be required before financial stability can be assured. Market participants must\nhave well-anchored expectations that government-funded rescues will not be forthcoming.\nIdeally, policymakers would act in a manner that is consistent with those expectations. But in\nturbulent times, as we’ve seen, it may be tempting to act otherwise. This is a particular danger\nfor central banks, whose independent balance sheets place their fiscal actions beyond the scope\nof the legislative appropriations process. 19 Credible commitment to orderly unassisted resolutions\nthus may require eliminating the government’s ability to provide ad hoc rescues. This would\nmean repealing the Federal Reserve’s remaining emergency lending powers and further\nrestraining the Fed’s ability to lend to failing institutions. And once robust and credible\nresolution plans are in place, we would be able to responsibly wind down the FDIC’s Orderly\nLiquidation Authority and related financing mechanisms.\nI believe this strategy can bring us a financial system where market participants don't expect\ngovernment support and thus they manage their risks appropriately; where taxpayers aren't on the\nhook for institutions with the wrong incentives; but where financial institutions can effectively\nprovide the services a dynamic and innovative economy requires. This is going to be hard work,\nand some will claim it’s impossible. But the alternative seems even less promising — the specter\nof an ever-increasing share of the financial sector effectively guaranteed by taxpayers. That path\nis unlikely to serve our country well. So I believe we need to step up and face the challenge of\ncreating a stable and resilient financial system.\n*The text originally misstated the year of the Penn Central Railroad collapse as 1971 and has been\ncorrected to 1970.\n1\n\nThe Richmond Fed’s “Bailout Barometer” is available online.\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n3\nSee Charles W.

            "content": "Investing in People for Long-Term Prosperity\nApril 15, 2015\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharleston, South Carolina\n\nGood evening. It is a pleasure to be here in Charleston and get a taste of the region’s economic\ndynamism, from its burgeoning tech sector to aerospace manufacturing to advanced research on\nrenewable energy. (Of course, the lovely architecture and excellent low-country cuisine don’t\nhurt.) The key to this dynamism is human capital, a phrase economists use to refer to the\nknowledge and skills that make people productive. Investment in human capital ensures that we\nhave a skilled workforce capable of developing and implementing new technologies, and that\nworkers are able to reap the benefits of economic growth. I know that civic leaders in Charleston,\nlike leaders elsewhere around the country, are acutely aware that workforce quality is a critical\nfactor when companies are choosing where to locate new facilities. A skilled workforce thus is\nessential to a region’s economic vitality.\nThis fact, along with the burgeoning research activity focused on labor market dynamics in the\nwake of the recent recession, has motivated us at the Richmond Fed to survey what the\neconomics literature has to say about enhancing workforce skills. This evening, I’d like to talk\nabout several key elements in a comprehensive, research-based approach to improving human\ncapital investment: providing students with a better understanding of college preparedness;\ninforming them about multiple career and postsecondary education options; and laying the\nfoundation for success with early childhood education. Before I discuss these ideas in more\ndetail, I must note that these are my own views and should not be attributed to anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System. 1\nThe Impact of Technology\nTwenty-five years ago, nearly 25 percent of South Carolina’s workers were employed in\nmanufacturing, many of them in textile mills that moved south from New England in the 1950s\nas their owners sought cheaper labor. In the 1990s, those mills were moved overseas in search of\neven cheaper labor, and manufacturing employment in the state declined precipitously. Today,\nfewer than 12 percent of South Carolinians work in manufacturing. Recently, however, the state\nhas experienced a resurgence of advanced manufacturing, and the value of the goods produced in\nthe state has increased even as employment has declined.\nThe factories producing airplane components and ballistic-resistant cars don’t look much like the\nfactories of old. You might have heard the adage that the factory of the future will have only two\nemployees: a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog, and the dog will be there to\nkeep the man from touching the equipment. 2 That’s a bit of an exaggeration, but it’s true that\n\n1\n\n\ftoday’s factories employ far fewer people than they used to, and those people often must have\nspecialized training to operate complex computer-controlled machinery.\nWhen new technologies increase the demand for skilled workers who can operate those\ntechnologies, economists refer to it as “skill-biased technical change.” Because it takes time for\npeople to learn new skills, this increase in demand initially leads to higher wages for skilled\nworkers relative to less-skilled workers. But as the higher wages spur more people to obtain the\nnecessary education, the supply of skilled workers tends to respond to the demand, and the wage\ndifferential tends to narrow.\nEconomists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz have documented this dynamic — the “race\nbetween education and technology” — throughout the 20th century in the United States. 3 In the\nearly 1900s, new technologies such as typewriters and adding machines created a new class of\nwhite-collar clerical jobs that required a high school education. Because few people had a\ndegree, these jobs paid about twice as much as jobs that did not require a high school degree. 4\nThe response was a dramatic increase in high school graduation rates. Between 1910 and 1940,\nthe number of 19-year-olds in the United States with a diploma increased from 9 percent to 51\npercent. 5 Over that same time period, the wage premium associated with high school completion\ncollapsed.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, as the computer revolution took hold, demand for collegeeducated workers began to rise, and hence their relative wage rates rose as well. As one would\nexpect, there has been an increase in the number of people with a college degree. In 2014, about\n32 percent of adults over age 25 had at least a bachelor’s degree; in 1980, that number was only\n17 percent. 6 And yet, the “college premium” has continued to increase: In 1980, the average\nworker with a college degree or higher earned about 40 percent more than the average worker\nwith only a high school diploma. In 2014, the college-educated worker earned about 80 percent\nmore. 7 The inescapable conclusion is that we are failing to keep pace with our economy’s\ngrowing demand for skilled workers.\nThe Importance of Human Capital\nWe should be concerned about this for two reasons. First, it has implications for long-run growth\nin standards of living. There is a consensus among economists that such growth occurs not only\nbecause we have more people working or more machines (or, in economic terms, more labor and\nmore capital) but also because technological advances make existing workers more productive.\nSuch advances might be entirely new types of machines, such as the steam engine or the\ntransistor, or they might be new techniques for making existing products. In the 1980s, for\nexample, the steel industry was transformed by the introduction of mini-mills, which used scrap\ninstead of iron ore and dramatically lowered the time and cost of producing steel. (As an aside,\nthe first mini-mill was developed by Nucor, which has a plant just up the road in Huger.)\nHow and why do such advances occur? There are a variety of economic forces and incentives at\nwork, but a large body of research suggests that human capital is a critical factor. Countries with\nmore initial human capital appear to have a greater capacity to develop new technologies and to\n\n2\n\n\fcopy or adapt technologies developed in other countries. Skilled workers thus seem essential not\nonly to operate new technologies but also to develop the new technologies in the first place.\nThe second concern is that the slowdown in the supply of skilled workers affects the distribution\nof income in our society. Recent data on economic inequality and economic mobility show that\ninequality has increased in recent years, while mobility has either decreased or remained flat. 8 In\nother words, the rich are likely to remain rich and the poor are likely to remain poor. Many\nfactors contribute to inequality and the persistence of that inequality both within and across\ngenerations. But the growing disparity in skill acquisition, often in the form of college education,\nappears to play a significant role.\n\nPreparing a Skilled Workforce\nRising inequality is not the only clue that we are not adequately preparing the next generation of\nworkers. Nationwide, about 20 percent of high school students fail to graduate within four years,\nand there are significant disparities in graduation rates between white students and black or\nHispanic students and between students from high-income and low-income families. In some\nlarge urban school districts, as many as 40 percent of students do not graduate in four years.\nA growing share of those who do complete high school now go on to college. But far too many\nof these students fail to earn a degree: Nationally, the college dropout rate is around 40 percent. 9\nThe benefits of attending college for a few semesters without graduating are relatively small. The\nunemployment rate for workers with some college education but no degree is comparable to the\nrate for workers with only a high school degree. And while students who have attended some\ncollege do earn on average about 15 percent more than high school graduates, this pales in\ncomparison with the average earnings of those who have completed bachelor’s degrees.\nThere is also substantial anecdotal evidence that employers are having difficulty finding workers\nwith the right skills. This is a common refrain on our visits to communities throughout the\nregion, and it’s supported by employer surveys. For example, in one recent study, 75 percent of\nmanufacturers reported a moderate to severe shortage of skilled workers, such as welders, who\nmust have strong math skills and be able to read blueprints. 10 There is an ongoing debate among\nresearchers about the actual amount of “skill mismatch” in the labor market, 11 but many\nemployers certainly seem to perceive that such mismatch is real.\nThe key question is what can we do to increase the supply of skilled workers? The large increase\nin the college premium has led many policymakers and educators to advocate college for all. But\nas the high college dropout rate indicates, there is a big difference between enrolling in college\nand graduating. During focus group meetings held recently in Virginia by the Richmond Fed,\nrepresentatives from four-year colleges and community colleges shared that many students are\nsurprised to discover they lack the basic math skills necessary for college-level work. If students\noverestimate their readiness for college, they may be more likely to enroll in college but then\ndrop out after they get there. That can be a costly lesson to learn; the average debt burden among\ncollege dropouts who took out loans is more than $14,000. 12 The high college dropout rate thus\n\n3\n\n\fsuggests that many students could benefit from more information about what is required for\ncollege success.\nOf course, it’s not enough to simply prescribe what students need to know; we must also help\nthem learn it. This points to the value of improving the effectiveness of the K-12 portion of our\neducation system. While that subject is beyond the scope of this talk, I applaud the ongoing\nefforts here in South Carolina and across the country to increase student achievement and close\nthe gaps between students of different backgrounds.\nI also believe we should supplement information about college preparedness with information\nabout other career and postsecondary education options. Community colleges, for example, are a\nvenue where students can learn more about their interests and aptitudes and hone the skills that\nare required for success at four-year schools. Moreover, there are a range of other post-high\nschool educational institutions that can help students acquire the skills they need to succeed\nwithout a college degree. One factor in the high school dropout rate may be the increasing focus\nof many high schools on college preparation. Some students, however, may not wish to attend\ncollege or may see large barriers to doing so. If these students believe the only reason to\ncomplete high school is to attend college, they might not see much value in doing what’s\nrequired to graduate. Learning about alternative career and educational opportunities that also\nrequire a high school degree could increase the perceived value of high school completion and\nimprove their labor market outcomes relative to dropping out. 13\nOn the other hand, we can do more to ensure that well-qualified students don’t forgo college\nbecause of perceived obstacles such as cost or because of social norms that cause them to\nunderestimate the potential benefits or their likelihoods of success. Researchers have found that\nproviding these students with targeted information and assistance — a fairly low-cost\nintervention — can increase their matriculation rates and can play an important role in changing\nthe beliefs of students who erroneously think they’re not college material. 14\nSo far I have discussed ways to increase cognitive skills, the specific things we learn through\nformal education or on-the-job training. But non-cognitive skills such as patience, work ethic and\nfollowing directions also are critical. These are the skills that make it possible for us to acquire\nmore-complex cognitive skills, and they also are critical for success in the labor market. For\nexample, during our focus group meetings, high school teachers and administrators shared that\nmany students did not know how to self-direct or self-motivate, skills that are critical for college\nsuccess. Workforce development professionals we spoke with reported that a lack of “soft skills”\nwas a major obstacle to employment for their adult clients. We also hear from the employers\nwho participate in our industry roundtables that many job applicants are lacking in soft skills.\nHow does one acquire these non-cognitive skills? A cadre of economists and other social science\nresearchers, led by the work of Nobel laureate James Heckman, has come to a consensus that the\nfoundation is laid very early in life, and that it can be difficult for children who fall behind to\ncatch up. Skill gaps are evident as early as age 5 and tend to persist into adulthood. 15 The\nimportance of early skill development also means that the return on a dollar invested in early\nchildhood education can be much higher than the return on a dollar invested later in life. High-\n\n4\n\n\fquality early childhood education thus should be a crucial — and cost-effective — element of a\ncomprehensive strategy to improve human capital investment.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, technological advances change the demand for skills in our economy. In recent\ndecades, innovation has tilted demand toward more-skilled workers, and these trends seem likely\nto continue. An increasingly better-educated workforce thus will be essential to the long-term\nprosperity of a region or a nation.\nOur reading of the research literature supports a balanced portfolio of human capital strategies\nthat address the full range of educational stages and options. This comprehensive approach to\nhuman capital investment includes the following elements (in addition to enhancing the overall\neffectiveness of the K-12 education system):\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nInforming middle and high school students about what is required for success in college;\nInforming middle and high school students about multiple postsecondary educational\noptions;\nProviding targeted information to well-qualified students who for various reasons may\noverestimate the costs of a college education; and\nInvesting in high-quality early childhood education.\n\nI believe these strategies can help not only to increase our nation’s prosperity but also to\nprovide our citizens with the skills they need to share in that prosperity.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nThis statement is generally attributed to the late Warren Bennis, a professor of business administration at the\nUniversity of Southern California.\n3\nClaudia Goldin and Lawrence F.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, April 2015\nApril 10, 2015\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nGlobal Interdependence Center and the Financial Planning Association of the Suncoast\nSarasota Yacht Club\nSarasota, Florida\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. 1\nTo quickly preview where I am headed, over the next couple of years I expect to see solid\ngrowth and inflation moving back toward 2 percent. Based on that outlook, I believe a strong\ncase can be made for an increase in the federal funds rate target relatively soon. Before I begin to\nexplain, however, I need to emphasize that these are my own views and should not be attributed\nto anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. 2\nThe key to my outlook is consumer behavior, since household expenditures account for about\ntwo-thirds of GDP, our broadest measure of economic activity. Consumer spending has grown at\na relatively modest pace for much of this recovery. Weak job market prospects, a large debt\noverhang and depressed home values made households cautious and reluctant to spend. But the\njob market is considerably stronger now. Since June of last year, payroll employment has\nexpanded by 2.3 million, a 2.2 percent annual rate. As a result, incomes are rising rapidly; since\nJune, real disposable personal income has increased at a 4.5 percent annual rate. So it’s not\nsurprising that real consumer spending has grown at a 3.1 percent annual rate over that time\nperiod, a notable pickup from the post-recession trend of around 2 ¼ percent.\nAs an aside, note that I have highlighted how these figures have changed since the middle of last\nyear. It’s often useful to focus on such broader trends in the data, because economic statistics can\nbe quite volatile on a month-to-month or even quarter-to-quarter basis. For example, readings on\nsome indicators have been unexpectedly weak in recent weeks, some of which may be\nattributable to unseasonably adverse weather. It’s too soon say how much, however, and the\nmore prudent approach is to look through very short-term fluctuations and assess emerging\ntrends based on a longer run of data.\nSome of the recent growth in real disposable income is attributable, of course, to the dramatic\ndecline in energy prices since the middle of last year. This represents a one-time boost to the\nlevel of consumer spending, but should only have a transitory effect on spending growth, since\nenergy price declines cannot go on forever. Indeed, oil prices appear to have bottomed out for the\ntime being. So while I expect stronger consumer spending growth than we saw earlier in this\nexpansion, I do not expect consumer spending to continue to expand at the 4.4 percent rate we\nsaw in the fourth quarter.\n\n1\n\n\fBut I do believe that the improvement in job market conditions will have a more persistent effect\non U.S. households. I mentioned the strong growth in payroll employment since last June. We’ve\nalso seen unmistakable improvement in measures of labor market turnover. The average rate at\nwhich employers are hiring new workers has risen significantly since a year ago, and the number\nof posted job openings has increased by 23 percent. Interestingly, the number of quits has risen\nby 10 percent over the last year, which suggests that workers are becoming increasingly\nconfident that good jobs are readily available. These indicators of labor market “flows” are\nespecially noteworthy. In a healthy economy, labor market transitions are relatively frequent and\nover time lead to better matches between worker characteristics and job responsibilities and to\nrising productivity. The latest data suggest that the economy is recovering some of its fluidity,\nwhich bodes well for longer-run economic performance.\nWe also know that in the past a substantial improvement in labor market conditions has been\nassociated with stronger wage and salary growth. Here the most recent evidence is mixed. Over\nthe 12 months ending in February, the Labor Department’s estimate of average hourly earnings\nin the private sector only increased 2.1 percent, essentially the same figure we’ve seen for the\nlast few years. But the Labor Department also conducts another wage survey with some\nimportant differences in methodology, which results in a measure called the employment cost\nindex. This measure (also for private sector employees) increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate\nover the last three quarters of 2014, a noticeable pickup from the previous trend. My own view\nis that a stronger labor market is bound to lead to stronger wage and salary growth, if it hasn’t\ndone so already. Thus, I expect labor market conditions to improve further in the months ahead\nand thereby provide additional support to household incomes and their confidence in future job\nprospects.\nThe improvements we’ve seen in consumer finances in recent years should also bolster growth.\nThe value of household financial assets has increased by over 50 percent since early 2009, and\nliabilities have been basically flat over the same time period. While not every household would\nsay the process of balance sheet repair is complete, substantial progress has clearly been made.\nRecent improvements in consumer sentiment and household balance sheets have not invigorated\nthe housing market, however. New single-family home sales last year were only 2.1 percent\nahead of the previous year, and new single-family housing starts were only 4 percent ahead,\nleaving both measures well below pre-recession levels. I believe most of this sluggishness is\nunlikely to change quickly. The fall in home prices during the recession has given households a\ngreater appreciation of the risks of leveraged investments in housing. This is contributing to what\nappears to be a relatively persistent shift in preferences away from ownership of single-family\ndetached homes. So while we should see some modest further gains in housing activity this year,\nI do not expect housing construction to be a major contributor to overall growth.\nIn contrast, business fixed investment has been a solid contributor throughout this expansion.\nLast year it increased by 6.2 percent. This year I expect growth to remain robust in most\ncategories of investment spending, but there is one exception. The price of crude oil has fallen by\nmore than 50 percent in less than a year, and in response, the number of new oil wells being\nconstructed has fallen sharply. That category of construction spending represented less than 10\n\n2\n\n\fpercent of business capital spending last year, however, so I expect that 2015 will be another\ngood year for business investment as a whole.\nNet exports are likely to be more of a challenge this year. Over the last year, the value of the\ndollar in foreign exchange markets has risen by 13 percent. This has made imports more\nattractive here and domestic producers less competitive globally, which can be expected to\nincrease our trade deficit and slow the growth of overall U.S. production for a time.\nFinally, federal government spending on goods and services is likely to continue to restrain\ngrowth. Over the last four years, we’ve seen such spending fall at a 3.0 percent annual rate in\nreal terms. Most forecasters are projecting federal spending on goods and services to contract\nfurther in 2015 and beyond.\n\nTo sum up, the critical consumer sector has gathered momentum over the course of the last year.\nThat strength has been based on improvements in labor market conditions and real incomes that\nseem likely to be sustained. Business investment should also contribute to growth this year.\nThose two segments are likely to move the economy ahead despite subdued residential\ninvestment and declining federal spending and net exports. This should put GDP growth again in\nthe 2 to 2 ½ percent range, which will be ample enough to generate further improvement in labor\nmarket conditions.\nThe inflation outlook has received more than the usual amount of attention lately. As you\nprobably know, headline inflation has been relatively weak lately due to falling energy prices.\nOver the last 12 months, overall inflation, as measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, has averaged 0.3 percent. Last spring, prior to the fall in energy\nprices, that figure was 1.7 percent, much closer to the 2 percent goal that the Federal Open\nMarket Committee announced in 2012 and has reaffirmed every year since. This illustrates the\nextent to which inflation can be quite volatile at short horizons, and yet remain remarkably stable\nover longer horizons. Over the last 25 years, we’ve seen inflation fall to –1 percent and rise to\nover 4 percent. And yet, over that same time period inflation has averaged 1.99 percent, which is\nvery close to 2 percent.\nThe critical question for monetary policy is whether inflation can be expected to average 2\npercent going forward. To get a sense of the near-term direction of inflation, many economists\nlook at so-called “core” price indices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories.\nCore inflation over the last 12 months was 1.4 percent — above the headline inflation rate but\nstill below 2 percent. The recent surge in the foreign exchange value of the dollar has held down\nimport prices, which in turn has dampened core inflation. But the dollar is unlikely to rise\nindefinitely — and indeed, many forecasters expect the dollar to peak sometime this year. If so,\ncore inflation is likely to begin moving back toward 2 percent this year. Likewise, energy prices\nare unlikely to fall forever — indeed, it looks as if they may have bottomed out for now. If so,\nheadline inflation is also likely to begin moving back toward 2 percent this year.\nAnother reason for confidence that inflation will move back toward 2 percent is the stability of a\nwide variety of measures of inflation expectations. Some measures come from surveys in which\n3\n\n\fconsumers and businesses are asked about the inflation rate they expect to prevail in coming\nyears. Other measures are derived by comparing the yields on inflation-indexed Treasury\nsecurities to the yields on similar non-indexed securities. The difference reflects the implied\ncompensation investors require for future inflation. Some of these inflation compensation\nmeasures declined late last year as oil prices drove down headline inflation. But an array of\napproaches using different methods all indicate that the average inflation rate investors expect to\nprevail has hardly fallen at all. The observed fall in inflation compensation instead reflects a\nreduction in the compensation investors require for bearing the risk that inflation turns out to be\nabove or below the expected average rate of inflation. This “inflation risk premium” is analogous\nto the premium that investors in, say, equities require for bearing the risk that equity returns turn\nout above or below expectations. Stripping this risk premium out from inflation compensation\nprovides estimates of expected inflation at various horizons. Such estimates have remained\nrelatively stable even though inflation compensation has fallen of late.\nThus, I remain confident that inflation will return to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal over time,\ndespite the low current readings on inflation. The dampening effect of recent movements in\nenergy prices and the value of the dollar will ultimately turn out to be transitory, even if further\nfluctuations occur. The focus for monetary policy should be on the outlook for inflation rather\nthan actually realized inflation. An immediate corollary is that a rise in actual inflation is not a\nprerequisite for raising interest rates.\nThis brings us to the subject of monetary policy, so let me share a few thoughts on the topic.\nFirst, I want to remind you that the current stance of monetary policy is highly accommodative.\nThe Federal Reserve ended 2014 with a balance sheet of unprecedented size, $4.5 trillion, and\nhas kept short-term interest rates near zero for over six years. This degree of monetary stimulus\nwould have been difficult to imagine before the Great Recession began. Now, however, the\nrecession is well behind us and economic conditions have improved quite significantly,\nparticularly over the last year. Real consumer spending is expanding more rapidly, as is\nemployment, labor market conditions have tightened significantly and unemployment is falling\nmore rapidly. And at this point, we are well within the confidence bands of any reasonable\nestimate of “maximum employment.”\nIn evaluating the stance of monetary policy, economists frequently find it useful to think in terms\nof real — that is, inflation-adjusted — interest rates. With short-term interest rates near zero and\nexpectations for inflation between 1 and 2 percent over the near term, the real federal funds rate\nis currently below –1 percent. Real interest rates need to vary over time with changes in\neconomic conditions and growth prospects. Our understanding of the relationship between\nobservable variables and the requisite real interest rate is admittedly imprecise. There is an active\ndebate underway among researchers about whether the real interest rate that an economy\ntypically requires has declined in recent years. Even taking that possibility into account,\nhowever, both theory and experience tell us that negative real interest rates are unlikely to be\nconsistent with continuing low inflation and the solid growth we’ve been experiencing in overall\neconomic activity. Accordingly, financial markets are pricing in an increase in the federal funds\nrate later this year, and media commenters are speculating on exactly when the first increase\nmight occur.\n\n4\n\n\fMy own view is that, given what we know today, a strong case can be made that the federal\nfunds rate should be higher than it is now. In its statement at its most recent meeting, however,\nthe FOMC said that an increase in the target range for the funds rate is unlikely at its upcoming\nApril meeting. The subsequent meeting, in June, is thus the first date at which the FOMC could\nraise the funds rate target without undermining its past communications. I expect that, unless\nincoming economic reports diverge substantially from projections, the case for raising rates will\nremain strong at the June meeting.\nIt is important to note that even after one, or even several, rate increases, the Fed still will be\nsupplying quite a bit of stimulus to economic activity. I am reminded of a very old saying that\nthe job of the central bank is to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going. In current\ncircumstances, raising the funds rate target a notch or two is less like taking away the punch\nbowl and more like just slowing down the refills. We will still be spiking the punch — just not\nquite as rapidly as we have been.\nMonetary policy thus will continue to provide stimulus for a considerable period until interest\nrates and the size of our balance sheet return to historically normal levels. It is worth\nemphasizing that there is no fixed, preset timetable for normalizing policy settings; the FOMC\nwill continually evaluate the latest information and determine the best course of action on a\nmeeting-by-meeting basis. Unexpected developments are always possible and the economic\noutlook has been known to shift rapidly. The Committee will need to be ready to update its\nassessments of the appropriate stance of monetary policy as economic conditions evolve.\n1\n2\n\nThese remarks are an updated version of a speech delivered March 31, 2015.\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n5\n\n\f",

This represents a one-time boost to the\nlevel of consumer spending, but should only have a transitory effect on spending growth, since\nenergy price declines cannot go on forever. Indeed, oil prices appear to have bottomed out for the\ntime being. So while I expect stronger consumer spending growth than we saw earlier in this\nexpansion, I do not expect consumer spending to continue to expand at the 4.4 percent rate we\nsaw in the fourth quarter.\n\n1\n\n\fBut I do believe that the improvement in job market conditions will have a more persistent effect\non U.S. households. I mentioned the strong growth in payroll employment in recent months.\nWe’ve also seen unmistakable improvement in measures of labor market turnover. The average\nrate at which employers are hiring new workers has risen significantly since a year ago, and the\nnumber of posted job openings has increased by 28 percent. Interestingly, the number of quits\nhas risen by 17 percent over the last year, which suggests that workers are becoming increasingly\nconfident that good jobs are readily available. These indicators of labor market “flows” are\nespecially noteworthy. In a healthy economy, labor market transitions are relatively frequent and\nover time lead to better matches between worker characteristics and job responsibilities and to\nrising productivity. The latest data suggest that the economy is recovering some of its fluidity,\nwhich bodes well for longer-run economic performance.\nWe also know that in the past a substantial improvement in labor market conditions has been\nassociated with stronger wage and salary growth. Here the most recent evidence is mixed. Over\nthe 12 months ending in February, the Labor Department’s estimate of average hourly earnings\nin the private sector only increased 2.0 percent, essentially the same figure we’ve seen for the\nlast few years. But the Labor Department also conducts another wage survey with some\nimportant differences in methodology, which results in a measure called the employment cost\nindex. This measure (also for private sector employees) increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate\nover the last three quarters of 2014, a noticeable pickup from the previous trend. My own view\nis that a stronger labor market is bound to lead to stronger wage and salary growth, if it hasn’t\ndone so already. Thus, I expect labor market conditions to improve further in the months ahead\nand thereby provide additional support to household incomes and their confidence in future job\nprospects.\nThe improvements we’ve seen in consumer finances in recent years should also bolster growth.\nThe value of household financial assets has increased by over 50 percent since early 2009, and\nliabilities have been basically flat over the same time period. While not every household would\nsay the process of balance sheet repair is complete, substantial progress has clearly been made.\nRecent improvements in consumer sentiment and household balance sheets have not invigorated\nthe housing market, however. New single-family home sales last year were only 2.1 percent\nahead of the previous year, and new single-family housing starts were only 4 percent ahead,\nleaving both measures well below pre-recession levels. I believe most of this sluggishness is\nunlikely to change quickly. The fall in home prices during the recession has given households a\ngreater appreciation of the risks of leveraged investments in housing. This is contributing to what\nappears to be a relatively persistent shift in preferences away from ownership of single-family\ndetached homes. So while we should see some modest further gains in housing activity this year,\nI do not expect housing construction to be a major contributor to overall growth.\nIn contrast, business fixed investment has been a solid contributor throughout this expansion.\nLast year it increased by 6.2 percent. This year I expect growth to remain robust in most\ncategories of investment spending, but there is one exception. The price of crude oil has fallen by\nmore than 50 percent in less than a year, and in response, the number of new oil wells being\nconstructed has fallen sharply. That category of construction spending represented less than 10\n\n2\n\n\fpercent of business capital spending last year, however, so I expect that 2015 will be another\ngood year for business investment as a whole.\nNet exports are likely to be more of a challenge this year. Over the last year, the value of the\ndollar in foreign exchange markets has risen by 11 percent. This has made imports more\nattractive here and domestic producers less competitive globally, which can be expected to\nincrease our trade deficit and slow the growth of overall U.S. production for a time.\nFinally, federal government spending on goods and services is likely to continue to restrain\ngrowth. Over the last four years, we’ve seen such spending fall at a 3.0 percent annual rate in\nreal terms. Most forecasters are projecting federal spending on goods and services to contract\nfurther in 2015 and beyond.\nYou are probably well aware of the importance of federal spending on goods and services for\nVirginia; for example, close to 13 percent of all federal contract spending in fiscal year 2014\nlanded in the commonwealth. Northern Virginia has been hit hard by reduced spending with\ngovernment contractors, and the Hampton Roads area has been hit hard by defense cuts. The\nbroader context to bear in mind, though, is that Virginia has generally fared better than the rest of\nthe nation prior to and during the most recent recession.\nTo sum up, the critical consumer sector has gathered momentum over course of the last year.\nThat strength has been based on improvements in labor market conditions and real incomes that\nseem likely to be sustained. Business investment should also contribute to growth this year.\nThose two segments are likely to move the economy ahead despite subdued residential\ninvestment and declining federal spending and net exports. This should put GDP growth again in\nthe 2 to 2 ½ percent range, which will be ample enough to generate further improvement in labor\nmarket conditions.\nThe inflation outlook has received more than the usual amount of attention lately. As you\nprobably know, headline inflation has been relatively weak lately due to falling energy prices.\nOver the last 12 months, overall inflation, as measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, has averaged 0.3 percent. Last spring, prior to the fall in energy\nprices, that figure was 1.7 percent, much closer to the 2 percent goal that the Federal Open\nMarket Committee announced in 2012 and has reaffirmed every year since. This illustrates the\nextent to which inflation can be quite volatile at short horizons, and yet remain remarkably stable\nover longer horizons. Over the last 25 years, we’ve seen inflation fall to –1 percent and rise to\nover 4 percent. And yet, over that same time period inflation has averaged 1.99 percent, which is\nvery close to 2 percent.\nThe critical question for monetary policy is whether inflation can be expected to average 2\npercent going forward. To get a sense of the near-term direction of inflation, many economists\nlook at so-called “core” price indices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories.\nCore inflation over the last 12 months was 1.4 percent – above the headline inflation rate but still\nbelow 2 percent. The recent surge in the foreign exchange value of the dollar has held down\nimport prices, which in turn has dampened core inflation. But the dollar is unlikely to rise\nindefinitely – and indeed, many forecasters expect the dollar to peak sometime this year. If so,\n3\n\n\fcore inflation is likely to begin moving back toward 2 percent this year. Likewise, energy prices\nare unlikely to fall forever – indeed, it looks as if they may have bottomed out for now. If so,\nheadline inflation is also likely to begin moving back toward 2 percent this year.\nAnother reason for confidence that inflation will move back toward 2 percent is the stability of a\nwide variety of measures of inflation expectations. Some measures come from surveys in which\nconsumers and businesses are asked about the inflation rate they expect to prevail in coming\nyears. Other measures are derived by comparing the yields on inflation-indexed Treasury\nsecurities to the yields on similar non-indexed securities. The difference reflects the implied\ncompensation investors require for future inflation. Some of these inflation compensation\nmeasures declined late last year as oil prices drove down headline inflation. But an array of\napproaches using different methods all indicate that the average inflation rate investors expect to\nprevail has hardly fallen at all. The observed fall in inflation compensation instead reflects a\nreduction in the compensation investors require for bearing the risk that inflation turns out to be\nabove or below the expected average rate of inflation. This “inflation risk premium” is analogous\nto the premium that investors in, say, equities require for bearing the risk that equity returns turn\nout above or below expectations. Stripping this risk premium out from inflation compensation\nprovides estimates of expected inflation at various horizons. Such estimates have remained\nrelatively stable even though inflation compensation has fallen of late.\nThus, I remain confident that inflation will return to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal over time,\ndespite the low current readings on inflation. The dampening effect of recent movements in\nenergy prices and the value of the dollar will ultimately turn out to be transitory, even if further\nfluctuations occur. The focus for monetary policy should be on the outlook for inflation rather\nthan actually realized inflation. An immediate corollary is that a rise in actual inflation is not a\nprerequisite for raising interest rates.\nThis brings us to the subject of monetary policy, so let me share a few thoughts on the topic.\nFirst, I want to remind you that the current stance of monetary policy is highly accommodative.\nThe Federal Reserve ended 2014 with a balance sheet of unprecedented size, $4.5 trillion, and\nhas kept short-term interest rates near zero for over six years. This degree of monetary stimulus\nwould have been difficult to imagine before the Great Recession began. Now, however, the\nrecession is well behind us and economic conditions have improved quite significantly,\nparticularly over the last year. Real consumer spending is expanding more rapidly, as is\nemployment, labor market conditions have tightened significantly and unemployment is falling\nmore rapidly. And at this point, we are well within the confidence bands of any reasonable\nestimate of “maximum employment.”\nIn evaluating the stance of monetary policy, economists frequently find it useful to think in terms\nof real – that is, inflation-adjusted – interest rates. With short term interest rates near zero and\nexpectations for inflation between 1 and 2 percent over the near term, the real federal funds rate\nis currently below –1 percent. Real interest rates need to vary over time with changes in\neconomic conditions and growth prospects. Our understanding of the relationship between\nobservable variables and the requisite real interest rate is admittedly imprecise. There is an active\ndebate underway among researchers about whether the real interest rate that an economy\ntypically requires has declined in recent years. Even taking that possibility into account,\n4\n\n\fhowever, both theory and experience tell us that negative real interest rates are unlikely to be\nconsistent with continuing low inflation and the solid growth we’ve been experiencing in overall\neconomic activity. Accordingly, financial markets are pricing in an increase in the federal funds\nrate later this year, and media commenters are speculating on exactly when the first increase\nmight occur.\nMy own view is that, given what we know today, a strong case can be made that the federal\nfunds rate should be higher than it is now. In its statement at its most recent meeting, however,\nthe FOMC said that an increase in the target range for the funds rate is unlikely at its upcoming\nApril meeting. The subsequent meeting, in June, is thus the first date at which the FOMC could\nraise the funds rate target without undermining its past communications. I expect that, unless\nincoming economic reports diverge substantially from projections, the case for raising rates will\nremain strong at the June meeting.\nIt is important to note that even after one, or even several, rate increases, the Fed still will be\nsupplying quite a bit of stimulus to economic activity. I am reminded of a very old saying that\nthe job of the central bank is to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going. In current\ncircumstances, raising the funds rate target a notch or two is less like taking away the punch\nbowl and more like just slowing down the refills. We will still be spiking the punch – just not\nquite as rapidly as we have been.\nMonetary policy thus will continue to provide stimulus for a considerable period until interest\nrates and the size of our balance sheet return to historically normal levels. It is worth\nemphasizing that there is no fixed, preset timetable for normalizing policy settings; the FOMC\nwill continually evaluate the latest information and determine the best course of action on a\nmeeting-by-meeting basis. Unexpected developments are always possible and the economic\noutlook has been known to shift rapidly. The Committee will need to be ready to update its\nassessments of the appropriate stance of monetary policy as economic conditions evolve.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n5\n\n\f",

            "content": "Education, Innovation and Economic Growth\nFebruary 10, 2015\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n2015 Emerging Issues Forum\nRaleigh Convention Center, Raleigh, N.C.\n\nGood morning. It’s a pleasure to be here and to be a part of this important conversation about the\nrole of innovation in North Carolina’s future growth and prosperity. Of course, as you all know,\ninnovation is an elusive concept, and no less elusive is what we can do to create more of it. But I\ndo believe we can be certain about three things. First, innovation is essential to economic growth.\nSecond, human capital — the knowledge and skills that make people more productive — drives\ninnovation. Finally, innovation in turn affects the return on investment in human capital. These\nthree insights have important implications for our efforts to help individual workers make fruitful\ninvestments in their own human capital and to create the skilled workforce our economy\nrequires. Today, I’d like to talk about several key elements in a comprehensive approach to\nimproving human capital investment: providing students with a better understanding of college\npreparedness; informing them about multiple career and postsecondary education options; and\nlaying the foundation for success with early childhood education. Before I discuss these ideas in\nmore detail, I must note that these are my own views and should not be attributed to anyone else\nin the Federal Reserve System. 1\nInnovation and Human Capital\nI started out by saying that innovation is an elusive concept. So what do I mean by innovation?\nThere is a consensus among economists that long-run growth in economic standards of living\ndepends critically on the rate of technological change. Growth occurs not only because we have\nmore people working or more machines (or, in economic terms, more labor and more capital) but\nalso because technological advances make existing workers more productive. Such advances\nmight be entirely new types of machines, such as the steam engine or the transistor, or they\nmight be new techniques for making existing products. In the 1980s, for example, the steel\nindustry was transformed by the introduction of mini-mills, which used scrap instead of iron ore\nand dramatically lowered the time and cost of producing steel. (As an aside, the first mini-mill\nwas developed by Nucor, whose headquarters are just a few hours south in Charlotte.)\nThe million-dollar question, of course, is how and why do such innovations occur? There are a\nvariety of economic forces and incentives at work, but a large body of research suggests that\nhuman capital is an important determinant of long-run growth in productivity. Countries with\nmore initial human capital appear to have a greater capacity to develop new technologies and to\ncopy or adapt technologies developed in other countries.\n\n1\n\n\fBut innovation and human capital also are linked by the fact that new technologies sometimes\nincrease the demand for skilled workers who can operate those technologies, a phenomenon\nknown as “skill-biased technical change.” Because it takes time for people to learn new skills,\nthis increase in demand initially leads to higher wages for skilled workers relative to less-skilled\nworkers. But as the higher wages spur more people to obtain the necessary education, the supply\nof skilled workers tends to respond to the demand, and the wage differential tends to narrow.\nEconomists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz have documented this dynamic — the “race\nbetween education and technology” — throughout the 20th century in the United States. 2 In the\nearly 1900s, new technologies such as typewriters and adding machines created a new class of\nwhite-collar clerical jobs that required a high school education. Because few people had a\ndegree, these jobs paid about twice as much as jobs that did not require a high school degree. 3\nThe response was a dramatic increase in high school graduation rates. Between 1910 and 1940,\nthe number of 19-year-olds in the United States with a diploma increased from 9 percent to 51\npercent. 4 Over that same time period, the wage premium associated with high school completion\ncollapsed.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, as the computer revolution took hold, demand for collegeeducated workers began to rise, and hence their relative wage rates rose as well. As one would\nexpect, there has been an increase in the number of people with a college degree. In 2013, about\n29 percent of adults over age 25 had at least a bachelor’s degree; in 1980, that number was only\n17 percent. 5 And yet, the “college premium” has continued to increase: In 1980, the average\nworker with a college degree or higher earned about 40 percent more than the average worker\nwith only a high school diploma. In 2013, the college-educated worker earned over 80 percent\nmore. 6 The inescapable conclusion is that we are failing to keep pace with our economy’s\ngrowing demand for skilled workers.\nThis has implications not only for our ability to develop and implement new technologies but\nalso for the distribution of income in our society. Recent data on economic inequality and\neconomic mobility show that inequality has increased in recent years, while mobility has either\ndecreased or remained flat. In other words, the rich are increasingly likely to remain rich and the\npoor are increasingly likely to remain poor. Many factors contribute to inequality and the\npersistence of that inequality both within and across generations. But the growing disparity in the\nacquisition of skills, often in the form of college education, appears to play a significant role.\nPreparing a Skilled Workforce\nYou don’t need to be an economist to be concerned that we are not adequately preparing the next\ngeneration of workers. Nationwide, about 20 percent of high school students fail to graduate\nwithin four years, and there are significant disparities in graduation rates between white students\nand black or Hispanic students, and between students from high-income and low-income\nfamilies. In some large urban school districts, as many as 40 percent of students do not graduate\nin four years.\nA growing share of those who do complete high school now go on to college. But far too many\nof these students fail to earn a degree: Nationally, the college dropout rate is around 40 percent. 7\n2\n\n\fThe benefits of attending college for a few semesters without graduating are relatively small. The\nunemployment rate for workers with some college education but no degree is comparable to the\nrate for workers with only a high school degree. And while students who have attended some\ncollege do earn on average about 15 percent more than high school graduates, this pales in\ncomparison with the average earnings of those who have completed bachelor’s degrees.\nThere is also substantial anecdotal evidence that employers are having difficulty finding workers\nwith the right skills. This is a common refrain on our visits to communities throughout the\nregion, and it’s supported by employer surveys. For example, 75 percent of manufacturers\nreported a moderate to severe shortage of skilled workers, such as welders, who must have\nstrong math skills and be able to read blueprints. 8 There is an ongoing debate among researchers\nabout the actual amount of “skill mismatch” in the labor market, 9 but many employers certainly\nseem to perceive that such mismatch is real.\nThe key question is what can we do to increase the supply of skilled workers? The large increase\nin the college premium has led many policymakers and educators to advocate college for all. But\nas the high college dropout rate indicates, there is a big difference between enrolling in college\nand graduating. During focus group meetings held recently in Virginia by the Richmond Fed,\nrepresentatives from four-year colleges and community colleges shared that many students are\nsurprised to discover they lack the basic math skills necessary for college-level work. If students\noverestimate their readiness for college, they may be more likely to enroll in college but then\ndrop out after they get there. That can be a costly lesson to learn; the average debt burden among\ncollege dropouts who took out loans is more than $14,000. 10 The high college dropout rate thus\nsuggests that many students could benefit from more information about what is required for\ncollege success.\nOf course, it’s not enough to simply prescribe what students need to know; we must also help\nthem learn it. This points to the value of improving the effectiveness of the K-12 portion of our\neducation system. While that subject is beyond the scope of this talk, I applaud the ongoing\nefforts here in North Carolina and across the country to increase student achievement and close\nthe gaps between students of different backgrounds.\nI also believe we should supplement information about college preparedness with information\nabout other career and postsecondary education options. Community colleges, for example, are a\nvenue where students can learn more about their interests and aptitudes and hone the skills that\nare required for success at four-year schools. Moreover, there are a range of other post-highschool educational institutions that can help students acquire the skills they need to succeed\nwithout a college degree. One factor in the high school dropout rate may be the increasing focus\nof many high schools on college preparation. Some students, however, may not wish to attend\ncollege or may see large barriers to doing so. If these students believe that the only reason to\ncomplete high school is to attend college, they might not see much value in doing what’s\nrequired to graduate. Learning about alternative career and educational opportunities that also\nrequire a high school degree could increase the perceived value of high school completion and\nimprove their labor market outcomes relative to dropping out. 11\n\n3\n\n\fOn the other hand, we can do more to ensure that well-qualified students don’t forgo college\nbecause of perceived obstacles such as cost or because of social norms that cause them to\nunderestimate the potential benefits or their likelihoods of success. Researchers have found that\nproviding these students with targeted information and assistance — a fairly low-cost\nintervention — can increase their matriculation rates and can play an important role in changing\nthe beliefs of students who erroneously think they’re not college material. 12\nSo far I have discussed ways to increase cognitive skills, the specific things we learn through\nformal education or on-the-job training. But non-cognitive skills such as patience, work ethic and\nfollowing directions also are critical. These are the skills that make it possible for us to acquire\nmore-complex cognitive skills, and they also are critical for success in the labor market. For\nexample, during our focus group meetings, high school teachers and administrators shared that\nmany students did not know how to self-direct or self-motivate, skills that are critical for college\nsuccess. Workforce development professionals we spoke with reported that a lack of “soft skills”\nwas a major obstacle to employment for their adult clients. We also hear from the employers\nwho participate in our industry roundtables that many job applicants are lacking in soft skills.\nHow does one acquire these non-cognitive skills? Led by the work of Nobel laureate James\nHeckman, many economists and other social science researchers have come to a consensus that\nthe foundation is laid very early in life, and that it can be difficult for children who fall behind to\ncatch up. Skill gaps are evident as early as age 5 and tend to persist into adulthood. 13 The\nimportance of early skill development also means that the return on a dollar invested in early\nchildhood education can be much higher than the return on a dollar invested later in life. Highquality early childhood education thus should be a crucial — and cost-effective — element of a\ncomprehensive strategy to improve human capital investment.\nThe Costs of Innovation\nBefore I conclude, I should acknowledge that while the benefits of innovation are numerous,\nthere are costs for some individuals. Steel mini-mills were a great advance, for example, but they\nalso contributed to the demise of former giants such as Bethlehem Steel, which in its heyday\nemployed nearly 300,000 people in the United States. North Carolina is no stranger to this\ntradeoff. For decades, people and communities throughout the state depended on furniture and\ntextile manufacturing to provide well-paying jobs, but advances in global transportation and\nshipping facilitated the movement of much of that activity overseas. And while there has been a\nresurgence in manufacturing in the state, the new advanced manufacturing techniques require far\nfewer workers. Today, there are only about half as many people employed in manufacturing in\nNorth Carolina as there were in 1990, even though the value of the goods produced has increased\n— a story that is true nationwide as well.\nMore broadly, while technological innovation may increase the demand for some types of\nworkers, it often reduces the demand for others — even, sometimes, for skilled workers, as\noccurred during the 1800s when new production techniques displaced glassblowers, shoemakers,\nbakers and other artisans. 14 More recently, computers have not been a boon for everyone. Many\nlower-skilled workers have been replaced by machines, and an increasing number of middle-skill\nworkers, such as tax preparers and paralegals, also are vulnerable to automation.\n4\n\n\fBut the technological displacement of workers has been part and parcel of rising living standards\nfor centuries. In 1900, more than 40 percent of the U.S. workforce worked in agriculture; today,\nthat number is less than 2 percent. Just as technology reduced the need for farm labor, it also\nallowed the creation of new jobs in new sectors, and I don’t think any of us would argue that we\nwould be better off if nearly half our population was employed to supply our caloric needs,\nrather than being free to work as engineers or truck drivers or nurses. We must understand the\nneeds of the workers who are displaced and recognize that adjusting to evolving circumstances\ntakes time, but history provides good reason to be optimistic that the changes wrought by\ntechnological innovation ultimately yield broadly shared gains.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, innovation is the primary driver of economic growth, and human capital is essential\nfor innovation to occur. At the same time, technological advances also change the skills\ndemanded by our economy. In recent decades, innovation has tilted demand toward more-skilled\nworkers, and these trends seem likely to continue. An increasingly better-educated workforce\nthus will be essential to the long-term prosperity of a region or a nation. A comprehensive\napproach to supporting human capital investment — one that focuses on the full range of\neducational stages and options — can help provide our citizens with the skills they need to share\nin that prosperity.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero, Kartik Athreya, Jamie Feik, Ann Macheras and Urvi Neelakantan for assistance in\npreparing these remarks.\n2\nClaudia Goldin and Lawrence F.

Before I begin, I\nwould like to emphasize that these are my own views and should not be attributed to anyone else\nin the Federal Reserve System. 1\nTo put the current outlook in context, it helps to take a glance at the rearview mirror. This\nexpansion has been much slower than any other expansion that anyone in this room is likely to\nremember. Real GDP, for example — our best single gauge of overall economic activity — has\nincreased at an annual rate of 2 ¼ percent per year since the recession ended in the second\nquarter of 2009. In contrast, the half century before the recession began — including both\nexpansions and recessions — saw real GDP grow at an average rate of around 3 ½ percent. That\nlengthy period of rapid growth naturally encouraged a strong sense that growth ought to be at\nleast 3 percent and that anything less is disappointing.\nTwo fundamental factors contribute to GDP growth over the longer run. One is population\ngrowth, which has slowed appreciably in recent years. Since the end of the recession, the socalled prime working age population, which consists of individuals ages 25 to 54, has actually\ndeclined. Baby boomers are moving out of the age ranges associated with peak labor force\nparticipation. In contrast, in the 50 years before the recession, the prime working age population\ngrew at a rate of 1.3 percent per year. Thus a good part of the recent slowing of GDP growth is\nsimply slower population growth.\nThe other fundamental component of growth is the increase in real GDP per worker, which is a\nmeasure of productivity. Since the end of the recession, this measure of productivity has\nincreased at a 1.4 percent annual rate, well below the average rate over the five decades before\nthe recession. So a good portion of the recent slowing of GDP growth is also attributable to\nslower productivity growth.\nThe remainder of the difference between pre- and post-recession growth is much smaller and is\naccounted for by the change in the ratio of employment to population — in other words, the\ncombined effect of changes in unemployment and labor force participation.\nAs the economy recovered from the Great Recession and real GDP growth continued to\ndisappoint, most economists scaled back their expectations regarding future growth. In fact, one\n\n1\n\n\fplausible scenario is for U.S. economic performance over the near term to closely resemble the\naverage experience over the last five years — that is, real growth around 2 ¼ percent per year.\nA somewhat brighter scenario is looking more plausible to me now, however. In recent quarters\ngrowth has been noticeably better than the post-recession average. Real GDP has increased by\n2.7 percent over the last four quarters, versus 2.1 percent over the previous three years. Payroll\nemployment rose by an average of 246,000 jobs per month over the 12 months ending in\nDecember, whereas it rose by an average of 185,000 jobs per month over the previous three\nyears.\nGranted, we’ve seen short-run growth spurts before during the course of this expansion, only to\nsee the pace of growth subside. But some recent developments that were largely absent during\nprevious spurts have improved the likelihood that the recent pickup in growth will be sustained.\nI would point first to consumer behavior. Household spending represents about two-thirds of\nGDP, and thus it is critical to headline growth. From the end of the recession to November 2013,\nconsumer spending rose at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent. Over the 12 months ending in\nNovember 2014, however, consumer spending has expanded by 2.8 percent. And over the six\nmonths ending in November, consumer spending has grown at a 4.3 percent annual rate, the\nhighest six-month growth rate since the middle of 2005.\nThis pickup in household spending was accompanied by an increase in real disposable income\nover the last year. But the increase was not as large as the rise in spending in recent months, and\nthus the personal saving rate has fallen. A declining saving rate in this situation typically signals\nconsumer confidence that the increase in incomes is solidly based and likely to continue. And\nother indicators point to the same conclusion. In the latter half of last year, the major survey\nmeasures of consumer sentiment all moved back to levels not seen since before the recession\nbegan. In particular, survey components related to expectations regarding future income and\nfinances have shown notable strength.\nDirect readings on labor market conditions suggest that consumers may have good reason for\nimproved confidence in their employment prospects. I’ve already mentioned last year’s\nimprovement in employment growth. The decline in the headline unemployment rate, which\npeaked at 10 percent in 2009, also picked up pace last year and was down to 5.6 percent in\nDecember. And the number of persons who were unemployed for over 26 weeks has fallen by 57\npercent since 2010.\nWe’ve seen noteworthy improvements in measures of turnover in labor markets as well. The\nnumber of job openings is up 20 percent year-over-year, and the hiring rate has increased\nsignificantly. Moreover, “quits” are up 20 percent year-over-year, suggesting that workers are\nbecoming more confident in their job prospects. The fact that these indicators of labor market\n“flows” are showing strong improvement is significant, I think. During this expansion, some\nobservers noted that measures of labor market “fluidity” or “dynamism” appeared to be\ndepressed relative to historical standards. In that context, the recent flow data suggests some\nprogress toward restoring the vitality of labor markets.\n\n2\n\n\fWe also know that a substantial improvement in labor markets has been associated historically\nwith stronger wage and salary growth. The employment cost index, which is a comprehensive\nmeasure of wages and benefits for private-sector workers, has increased at a 3 percent annual\nrate over the last two quarters. That is well above its 1.9 percent annual growth over the previous\nfive years. I should caution that a similar acceleration is not evident in other prominent measures\nof wages, so this is just tentative evidence at this point.\nIf labor market conditions continue to improve in the months ahead, it should provide further\nsupport to household incomes and confidence. The improvement we’ve seen in consumer\nfinances in recent years should also bolster growth. The value of household assets has increased\nby 38 percent since early 2009, while household liabilities have fallen slightly over the same\ntime period. While the process of balance sheet repair may not yet be complete, substantial\nprogress clearly has been made.\nRecent advances in consumer sentiment and financial wherewithal have not invigorated the\nhousing market, however. Over the last 12 months, new home sales have fallen by 1.6 percent\nand new housing starts have fallen by 7 percent. Much of this sluggishness, I believe, is due to\nfactors that are unlikely to change quickly. The fall in home prices during the recession has given\nhouseholds a greater appreciation of the risks of leveraged investments in housing. This is\ncontributing to what appears to be a relatively persistent shift in preferences away from\nownership of single-family detached homes. So while I expect some gains in housing activity in\n2015, I don’t think we should look for housing to make major contributions to overall growth.\nIn contrast, business investment in plant, equipment and intellectual property has been a solid\ncontributor to this expansion. Coming out of the recession, this measure of investment grew\nrapidly for a couple of years, then more moderately, but it picked up steam in the second quarter\nlast year. Business investment seemed to be carrying good momentum into the year-end, and in\nmy view is likely to continue to contribute to growth in overall activity in 2015.\nNet exports are likely to be more of a challenge this year. Over the last year, the value of the\ndollar in foreign exchange markets has risen by 8 percent. That makes imports more attractive\nhere and domestic producers less competitive globally, which can be expected to increase our\ntrade deficit and slow the growth of overall economic production.\nFinally, federal government spending on goods and services is likely to continue to restrain\ngrowth. Over the last three years, we’ve seen such spending fall at a 2.5 percent annual rate. That\nmay sound surprising, but note that this is only spending for goods and services, and it excludes\ntransfer payments, such as Medicare or food stamps. These transfer payments do not add directly\nto GDP; their only effect is through household incomes. Most forecasters are projecting federal\nspending to contract further in 2015 and beyond.\nYou are probably well aware of the importance of federal spending on goods and services for\nVirginia; for example, close to 13 percent of all federal contract spending in fiscal year 2014\nlanded in the commonwealth. Northern Virginia has been hit hard by reduced spending with\ngovernment contractors, and the Hampton Roads area has been hit hard by defense cuts.\nVirginia’s revenue stream has been significantly affected as well, which will make this year’s\n3\n\n\flegislative session particularly challenging. The broader context to bear in mind, though, is that\nthe state generally fared better than the rest of the nation prior to and during the most recent\nrecession.\nTo sum up, the key consumer sector has picked up in recent months, and I believe the growth\nwe’ve seen recently is more solidly based and is likely to continue. Business investment should\nalso contribute to growth this year, but residential investment probably won’t add much. Federal\nspending and net exports will likely subtract from overall activity.\nTaking stock of the recent data, I believe the odds are better now that the current pickup in\ngrowth will be sustained. In this higher-growth scenario we could see real GDP grow by 2 ½ to 3\npercent in 2015. We should not completely dismiss, however, a more temperate scenario in\nwhich growth reverts once again to the post-recession average of around 2 ¼ percent.\nThroughout this expansion we have seen periods of growth that were vigorous enough to get our\nhopes up but were followed by lower growth intervals that left the average growth rate fairly\nlow. On balance, though, while we don’t have enough evidence to rule out a return to a more\nmoderate growth path, I am leaning toward the higher-growth scenario as more likely.\nTurning to inflation, let me start by noting that in 2012 the Federal Open Market Committee\nstated that its inflation goal was for the price index for personal consumption expenditures to rise\nat a 2 percent annual rate over time. Over the last 25 years that measure of inflation has averaged\n2.06 percent per year. I am old enough to remember when the president of the United States\ndeclared that inflation was “Public Enemy Number One.” So I am grateful that the Fed took\nresponsibility for inflation and has kept inflation under control. That long-run record may explain\nwhy survey measures of expected inflation have been remarkably stable over the last several\nyears, despite the turmoil of the Great Recession and widespread media speculation about\ndeflation or inflation.\nAt short time horizons, inflation can be volatile, however, and over the last year inflation has\nonly averaged 1.2 percent. As you probably suspect, much of that weakness reflects the decline\nin energy prices. Prior to the fall in energy prices, the 12-month PCE inflation rate was 1.7\npercent — not that far from 2 percent. To get a sense of the near-term direction of inflation,\nmany economists look at core price indices, which exclude the volatile food and energy\ncategories. Core inflation over the last year was 1.4 percent — a bit higher than overall inflation\nbut still below 2 percent and down a bit from earlier last year. In past episodes of large energy\nprice movements, we have seen some bleed through into core inflation, and that seems to be\nhappening again. As a result, inflation trends may be a bit more difficult to discern in coming\nmonths. Nonetheless, I expect inflation to move tolerably close to the FOMC’s 2 percent target\nafter the fall in energy prices has played out.\nI’ll conclude with a few remarks on monetary policy. The Fed entered 2015 with a balance sheet\nof unprecedented size — around $4.5 trillion — and interest rates very close to zero. We are\nwidely expected to begin raising interest rates this year, and in September the FOMC issued a\nstatement outlining how it will go about doing that. Here are the key takeaways from that\ndocument. When the time comes, the Committee will raise its target range for the federal funds\nrate (the market interest rate on interbank loans). Currently, the target range is zero to 25 basis\n4\n\n\fpoints. Second, the Fed will move the federal funds rate into the target range primarily by\nadjusting the interest rate it pays to banks on excess reserve balances, which is currently 25 basis\npoints. Third, sometime after raising the interest rate target, the Fed will begin gradually\nreducing its balance sheet by allowing maturing security holdings to run off, rather than be\nreinvested, as is current practice. And fourth, the Fed will move in the longer run toward holding\nonly U.S. Treasury securities and will hold no more securities than necessary to implement\nmonetary policy efficiently and effectively.\nThat basic framework pertains to how the Fed intends to move toward more normal levels of\ninterest rates and asset holdings. I suspect some of you are just as avidly interested, if not more\nso, in when and how rapidly the Fed will raise rates. I hate to disappoint you, but the truth is\nnobody knows yet. There is no pre-set timetable for raising rates. The FOMC’s actions genuinely\nwill depend on the economic data available at the time. So I cannot tell you when and, more\nimportantly, how rapidly our rate target will rise.\nI will share an observation, however. The economic outlook can change rapidly, and judgments\nabout appropriate policy need to respond accordingly. It’s not hard to find historical examples:\nThe outlook for real activity shifted dramatically from late 1998, when overseas turmoil was\nthought to jeopardize U.S. growth, to early 1999, when it became clear that the effects would be\nminimal and activity was accelerating. Similarly, the outlook for growth and inflation shifted\nsignificantly from mid-2003, when inflation seemed to be sinking below 1 percent, to early 2004,\nwhen growth and inflation were clearly rising. Arguably, the Fed fell at least somewhat behind\nthe curve in each case. The lesson, I believe, is that policymakers should strive to look through\nclearly transitory phenomena to assess the underlying real economic developments that — as\nlong as inflation is anchored — determine the appropriate path for interest rates. And they need\nto be prepared to respond promptly.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n5\n\n\f",

            "content": "Committing to Financial Stability\nNovember 5, 2014\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nGeorge Washington University Center for Law, Economics and Finance\nWashington, D.C.\n\nThank you very much for inviting me to speak with you. The title of today’s conference poses a\nquestion of vital importance to the future health and stability of our financial system: Have we\nended the era of institutions that are deemed “too big to fail”? Unfortunately, I do not believe\nthat we have. Despite myriad legislative and regulatory responses to the crisis, such as the DoddFrank Act of 2010 and the Third Basel Accord reached in 2011, we have so far failed to address\na fundamental problem at the heart of the financial crisis of 2007-08.\nThat problem, as I will discuss in more detail, is that market participants have come to expect\ngovernment support when large financial institutions become distressed. Expectations of such\ninterventions distorted the incentives faced by these institutions and their counterparties and led\nto excessively fragile financial structures prior to the crisis. Capital ratios were low, and firms\nwere vulnerable to the loss of wholesale funding. As the crisis unfolded, multiple discretionary\ninterventions reinforced expectations of government support and further blunted incentives to\nprepare for potential turmoil. Continued ambiguity about the scope of future support destabilized\nmarket expectations and added unnecessary volatility.\nStrengthening regulatory restraints on risk-taking and improving the quantity and quality of\ncapital positions are important measures to reduce the likelihood of distress. By themselves,\nthough, they are likely to be insufficient. I will argue that if we want to prevent similar financial\ncrises in the future, and truly solve the problem of institutions that seem too big to fail, we must\nrealign the incentives of financial market participants. That requires a credible commitment on\nthe part of policymakers and regulators to end their reliance on government backstops. Before I\ndiscuss how we can achieve that commitment, I should note that the views expressed are my own\nand not necessarily the views of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nThe Nature of “Too Big to Fail”\nTo begin, let’s be clear about the problem are we trying to solve. The perception that some\ninstitutions are too big to fail results from two mutually reinforcing conditions that seriously\ndistort the incentives of financial market participants to monitor and control risk. First, creditors\nof some financial institutions feel protected by an implicit government commitment of support\nshould the institution become financially troubled. Second, policymakers often feel compelled to\nprovide support to certain financial institutions to insulate creditors from losses.\n\n1\n\n\fThe way the second condition reinforces the first should be fairly clear. Instances of government\nintervention reinforce creditors' expectations of support and thereby dampen incentives to\ncontain risk-taking. This promotes financial firms of greater size, complexity and\ninterconnectedness, and it also encourages greater leverage and more reliance on short-term\nfunding. In my view, excessive fragility is not an inherent feature of modern financial market\narrangements. Instead, financial instability should be seen as a consequence of the moral hazard\neffect of official intervention.\nCreditor expectations of support, in turn, often compel policymakers to intervene in the event of\ndistress, since disappointing those expectations by withholding support could provoke a sudden,\nturbulent readjustment of investor beliefs regarding support for other similarly situated firms. At\nsuch times, concern about exacerbating moral hazard takes a back seat to the urgently felt need\nto stem the volatility that would result from disappointed expectations. Perceived guarantees thus\nencourage fragility, which induces interventions, which encourages further fragility. The\nultimate result of this cycle is taxpayer-funded subsidies to financial firms that are widely viewed\nas deeply unfair.\nWhat we have is a fundamental flaw in the relationship between government and the financial\nsector resulting from the inability or unwillingness to find a way to forgo intervention in crises.\nAnd the impact of this flaw is growing. At the end of 1999, the government safety net —\nincluding both the implicit support I just outlined and explicit support provided by programs\nsuch as deposit insurance and pension guarantees — covered 45 percent of financial sector\nliabilities, according to Richmond Fed researchers. By the end of 2011, that number had grown\nto 57 percent, about the same size it was at the end of 2009, despite the many new regulations we\nhave put in place since the crisis. 2\nHow Did We Get Here?\nWe have arrived at this point, if I may be blunt, because of politics. Between 1929 and 1933,\nmore than one-third of the nation’s roughly 25,000 banks failed; entire states declared bank\nholidays and a nationwide bank holiday was declared in March 1933. 3 The banking system was\nhighly fragmented at that time due to laws restricting branching and competition, which meant\nthat banks were unable to diversify risks across regions or head off bank runs by moving funds\nbetween branches. One popular account of the wave of bank failures holds that the crisis was\ncaused by self-fulfilling depositor panic: Fearing failure, people rushed to withdraw their funds,\nthus ensuring that failure occurred. But modern scholarship has concluded that the crisis was in\nfact the result of fundamental shocks to the solvency of the banking system. 4 These shocks were\nthen exacerbated by the fragmented banking system. 5\nThe legislative response to the failures, however, was the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which\namong other provisions established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 6 Deposit\ninsurance was highly controversial; many policymakers, including President Roosevelt and Sen.\nCarter Glass, an architect of the Federal Reserve System, were wary of the inherent risk-taking\nincentives and mindful of many failed state deposit insurance schemes. But the unit banking\nsystem was popular with politically influential populist and agrarian groups, and these forces\n\n2\n\n\fsuccessfully lobbied instead for a system of government-provided deposit insurance that would\npreserve the viability of small local banks by protecting their depositors. 7\nOver time, government protection spread beyond insured bank depositors. Beginning in the early\n1970s, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve began intervening in ways that protected uninsured\ncreditors of large financial firms. Penn Central, Bank of the Commonwealth, Franklin National\nBank and Continental Illinois, among others, all benefited from government support. 8 In some\ncases, the FDIC provided funds to arrange mergers that allowed uninsured depositors to avoid\nlosses. In other cases, the Fed lent on terms that were unavailable in the open market. Fed\nlending also sometimes allowed uninsured creditors to withdraw funds while closure was\ndelayed, increasing the loss to the FDIC.\nI’m sure this audience is familiar with dramatic events of 2007–08, but I would like to highlight\nsome key moments in the narrative. In 2007, estimates of the losses likely to be experienced on\nsubprime mortgages rose significantly. This caused investors to revise their assessments of\nfinancial entities deemed likely to be exposed to those losses, most notably certain off-balancesheet funding vehicles. As a consequence, the credit terms available to these entities deteriorated.\nThe risk premia on their obligations in wholesale funding markets rose, and the maturity of the\nobligations they were able to issue was sharply reduced.\nIn August 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee took its first step in response to the tumult\nin financial markets by lowering the interest rate charged on discount window loans to banks and\nencouraging banks to borrow. Then in December 2007, in response to rising interest rates in\ninterbank lending markets, the Fed launched the Term Auction Facility to provide term loans to\ndepository institutions. The guiding principle behind these actions, and others that followed, was\nthat credit markets were malfunctioning and the remedy was additional central bank lending. In\nfact, steps were taken to reduce the perceived stigma of borrowing from the Fed and to\nencourage banks to access the discount window. 9\nArguably, however, market participants inferred that the Fed was standing by, again ready to\nrescue the creditors of financial institutions that showed signs of distress — which actually\noccurred the following spring when the New York Fed helped finance the purchase of Bear\nStearns by JPMorgan. These actions are likely to have reduced the incentives of other large\nfinancial firms, such as Lehman Brothers, to strengthen their positions by raising additional\nequity or reducing their reliance on short-term funding. Capital markets were clearly open for the\nlarge financial institutions prior to the middle of 2008, as demonstrated by the equity issuance\nthat did occur. But not enough new capital was raised; apparently the costliness of shareholder\ndilution made it more attractive for large financial firms to rely instead on the implied backstop\nof government support.\nPolicymakers were aware that their actions might exacerbate moral hazard. And certainly, we\ncan all understand a bias against inaction when faced with an unknown, but potentially grave,\noutcome. But the distortion in banks’ risk-taking incentives was viewed as a long-run issue to\ntrade off against the immediate value of cushioning an imminent blow to financial market\nfunctioning. Because financial crises are relatively infrequent, it was thought, the incentive\n\n3\n\n\fdistortion would only affect outcomes in the relatively distant future, leaving sufficient time for\npolicymakers to contain moral hazard effects through tougher regulation.\nBut the crisis we have just been through tells a different story. It wasn’t only some distant future\ncrisis that was affected by the precedents being set; it was the next chapter in the current crisis.\nEach new move to expand institutions’ use of Fed lending also had the effect of increasing\nexpectations of official support in the months ahead.\nThe idea that public sector backstops are necessary is often motivated more broadly by\ntheoretical models based on “multiple equilibria” or market segmentation in which outcomes are\ninherently unstable or suboptimal in the absence of government support. 10 I have not found these\nmodels terribly persuasive as accounts of the financial market phenomena that we grappled with\nat various points during the crisis, because the critical frictions on which these theories are based\nseem at odds with observations. 11 More broadly, the thesis that financial market instability is\ninherent, rather than induced by poor policies, must confront the fact that instances of instability\nare quite unevenly distributed across different countries and different regulatory regimes. 12 If\nfinancial fragility were an inherent feature of financial markets, financial panics would be\nubiquitous, but that’s not what we see.\nThe Regulatory Response\nLet me turn now to how policymakers responded once the immediate crisis had passed. In the\nUnited States the chief legislative response was the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which purports to\nend too big to fail once and for all. The Act provides for enhanced supervision of large financial\nfirms via stronger capital and liquidity requirements, periodic stress-testing, counterparty credit\nlimits and risk-management requirements, among other measures. U.S. banking regulators also\nhave adopted most of the increased capital requirements recommended in the Basel III\ninternational regulatory framework.\nGreater capital buffer requirements and measures to beef up ex-ante constraints on risk-taking\nare important, but they’re not infallible. New opportunities for risk-taking will always emerge as\nfinancial markets and economies evolve, and it is asking too much to expect front-line\nsupervisors to forever substitute for well-aligned incentives. Moreover, stronger restraints on\nrisk-taking increase the incentive for market participants to find a way to operate outside the\nregulated sector. This regulatory bypass gives rise to what’s come to be called “shadow banking”\n— a topic we will be hearing more about this afternoon. Shadow banking arrangements played a\nmajor role in the financial crisis; paradoxically, some of these arrangements were the result of\npast financial regulations intended to prevent crises. Expanding regulation to chase down\nfragility wherever it appears is not a promising strategy.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created a new mechanism to resolve large financial firms that become\ndistressed in spite of enhanced supervision. Title II of the Act established the Orderly\nLiquidation Authority, or OLA, which gives the FDIC the ability, with the agreement of other\nfinancial regulators, to take a firm into receivership. The FDIC also is able to borrow funds from\nthe U.S. Treasury to make payments to creditors of the failed firm or to guarantee the liabilities\n\n4\n\n\fof the failed firm. The funds are to be repaid from recoveries on the assets of the firm or from\nassessments against the largest, most complex financial companies.\nWhile the FDIC must pay creditors at least what they would have received in a liquidation of the\nfirm, the Act does give the FDIC broad discretion to pay some creditors more than bankruptcy\nwould allow. Moreover, the ability to inject funds borrowed from the Treasury allows the FDIC\nto immediately pay off creditors whose claims would otherwise be subject to bankruptcy\nproceedings. Short-term creditors are likely to believe they will benefit from the FDIC’s\ndiscretion, causing them to pay insufficient attention to risk and to invest in fragile funding\narrangements. If expectations of support for the creditors of financially distressed institutions are\nwidespread, regulators will likely feel forced to provide support to these short-term creditors to\navoid the turbulence of disappointing expectations. Rather than ending “too big to fail,” this\nwould replicate the two mutually reinforcing expectations that define it.\nThe Path Forward\nAchieving financial stability requires, in my view, two new mutually reinforcing conditions. The\nfirst is that creditors do not expect government support in the event of financial distress. If we\ncan achieve that, private sector financial firms and their creditors will have an incentive to avoid\nfragile financing arrangements and to limit risk-taking, thereby reducing the pressure for\ngovernment intervention. We could avoid relying solely on the vigilance of supervisors and\ninstead make more use of the discipline of competitive forces. The second necessary condition is\nthat policymakers actually do allow financial firms to fail without government support. If we can\nmake unassisted failures manageable, then policymakers could credibly commit to forgoing\nrescues, thereby improving private sector incentives.\nSo how do we make unassisted failures manageable? I believe we must rethink the notion that\nbankruptcy is not a viable option for large financial firms. 13 Bankruptcy offers many advantages,\nthe most obvious being that a collective proceeding can mitigate the common-pool problems that\narise if individual creditors rush to pursue individual remedies. 14 In addition, the deadweight\ncosts of bankruptcy are borne exclusively by the firm’s creditors and other stakeholders. The\nresult is a collective interest, ex ante, in striking an appropriate balance between the probability\nof bankruptcy, with its associated burdens, and the opportunity cost of measures designed to\nreduce the likelihood of bankruptcy. In particular, there is interest in avoiding ex-ante contractual\nprovisions that would make the firm excessively vulnerable to financial distress. These features\nof bankruptcy would seem to make it especially valuable in the financial sector, where firms\nhave a plethora of creditors and where the decentralized pursuit of individual remedies ― that is,\nruns ― can damage a firm’s value, even its ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act lays out a path toward making bankruptcy workable for large financial\ninstitutions. The Act requires these institutions to create resolution plans, also known as “living\nwills.” These are detailed plans that explain how a financial institution could be wound down\nunder U.S. bankruptcy laws without threatening the rest of the financial system or requiring\ngovernment assistance. The plans explain how to disentangle the many different legal entities —\nsometimes numbering in the thousands — that make up a large financial firm. Under the Dodd-\n\n5\n\n\fFrank Act, large banks and other “systemically important” firms are required to submit these\nplans on an annual basis for review by the Fed and the FDIC.\nResolution planning provides a structured approach for understanding what’s likely to happen in\nthe event a large financial firm fails. In contrast, in past crises policymakers found themselves\nwith little or no preparatory work to draw on. In fact, the process has already proven valuable by\ngiving firms a better and more detailed understanding of their legal structure, and many have\nused the process to reorganize themselves and eliminate unneeded legal entities.\nResolution planning wisely does not take the current operating profile of large financial firms as\ngiven; the current characteristics of these firms evolved in response to the precedents set by\nregulators avoiding the use of bankruptcy. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that if the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC jointly determine that a plan would not credibly facilitate an orderly\nresolution under the Bankruptcy Code, the firm is required to submit a revised plan to address\nidentified deficiencies. If the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not\nremedy identified deficiencies, they can require more capital, increase liquidity requirements or\nrestrict the growth, activities or operations of the firm. They can even require firms to make\ndivestitures.\nOn August 5, the Fed and the FDIC announced the completion of reviews of the second round of\nresolution plans submitted in 2013 by the 11 banks that make up the first group of filers. These\nfirms submitted their original plans in 2012. 15 In a joint announcement, the agencies noted the\nbanks had made some significant improvements from their first submissions. 16 But the agencies\nalso outlined several shortcomings, including, to quote the announcement, “the failure to make,\nor even to identify, the kinds of changes in firm structure and practices that would be necessary\nto enhance the prospects for orderly resolution.” Clearly, substantial work remains to be done.\nThe needed alterations to the structure and operations of large financial firms will be unpopular\nsince they are likely to involve reductions in reliance on short-term funding and the adoption of\nmore easily severable subsidiary structures. But I believe the changes that could result from\nliving wills are feasible without sacrificing the inherent benefits large financial firms provide to\nthe economy. The credibility of living wills would be compromised, in my view, by continuing\nto depend on government backstops in order to avoid needed changes.\nIn addition to requiring financial firms to adapt their operations to the Bankruptcy Code, we\nshould also look for ways to better adapt the Bankruptcy Code to financial firms. One proposed\nreform seeks to vest the firm’s losses solely in the parent company. Because it protects the\ncreditors of the subsidiaries, however, this strategy might not be the most effective means to\nrestore market discipline. Other work has highlighted the fact that many short-term financing\ninstruments and derivatives are exempt from bankruptcy's automatic stay. This safe harbor\ntreatment arguably over-encourages the use of such instruments and thereby enhances the growth\nand fragility of shadow banking. Some have proposed limiting this exemption as well as adding a\nnew chapter to the Bankruptcy Code specifically adapted to large financial firms. 17 These reform\nproposals strike me as compelling and worthy of serious consideration.\n\n6\n\n\fA final step may be required before financial stability can be assured. Market participants must\nhave well-anchored expectations that government-funded rescues will not be forthcoming.\nIdeally, policymakers would act in a manner that is consistent with those expectations. But in\nturbulent times, as we’ve seen, it may be tempting to put seemingly urgent short-run\nconsiderations ahead of the goal of establishing and preserving a record of precedents that keep\nmarket expectations well anchored. This is a particular danger for central banks, whose\nindependent balance sheets place their fiscal actions beyond the scope of the legislative\nappropriations process. 18 Credible commitment to orderly unassisted resolutions thus may\nrequire eliminating the government’s ability to provide ad hoc rescues. This would mean\nrepealing the Federal Reserve’s remaining emergency lending powers and further restraining the\nFed’s ability to lend to failing institutions. And once robust and credible resolution plans are in\nplace, we would be able to responsibly wind down the FDIC’s Orderly Liquidation Authority\nand related financing mechanisms.\nConclusion\nToday, I have shared with you what I view as a fundamental problem that gives rise to\ninstitutions deemed “too big to fail.” That problem is market participants’ expectations that\ngovernment support will be forthcoming if a large financial institution becomes distressed and, at\nthe same time, policymakers’ beliefs that they must fulfill those expectations. The result is a\nserious misalignment of incentives and excessive reliance on risky short-term funding. In short,\ngovernment backstops induce rather than preserve financial stability.\nTo dismantle these expectations, we must make resolution via the Bankruptcy Code a viable\noption for large complex financial institutions. That means doing the hard work of making living\nwills credible, and it means policymakers and regulators must commit to using them. This is a\ndaunting task. But I find the alternative dismaying — the specter of an ever-increasing share of\nthe financial sector effectively guaranteed by taxpayers. That outcome is not in the best interest\nof our country. I believe we owe it to our citizens to do whatever work it takes to create a stable\nand resilient financial system.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nThe Richmond Fed’s estimates of the size of the safety net are available online.\n3\nKris James Mitchener, “Bank Supervision, Regulation, and Instability During the Great Depression,” National\nBureau of Economic Research Working Paper no. 10475, May 2004.

            "content": "Rethinking the Unthinkable: Bankruptcy for Large Financial Institutions\nOctober 10, 2014\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nNational Conference of Bankruptcy Judges Annual Meeting\nChicago, Illinois\n\nThank you for that introduction. It’s a pleasure to be here before such an esteemed audience of\nbankruptcy professionals. You might be wondering why a central banker, the head of a regional\nFederal Reserve Bank, is interested in bankruptcy — particularly since distressed banks and\nother financial firms have for decades been handled outside the Bankruptcy Code, through\ndiscretionary processes that at times involve government-funded protection of depositors and\nother creditors. But in fact, that is precisely the source of my interest: I have come to believe that\nsuch discretionary actions played a critical role in the financial crisis of 2007-08. Expectations of\nsuch interventions distorted the incentives faced by these institutions and their counterparties and\nled to excessively fragile financial structures prior to the crisis. And as the crisis unfolded,\nmultiple discretionary interventions destabilized market expectations and added unnecessary\nturbulence. I will argue that if we want to prevent similar financial crises in the future, and truly\nsolve the problem of institutions that seem “too big to fail,” we must realign the incentives of\nfinancial market participants. Regulatory constraints on risk-taking, while useful, will not\nsuffice. Using the Bankruptcy Code rather than discretionary governmental interventions to\naddress large financial institution failures is essential to that task.\nMany observers are surprisingly resistant to the notion that bankruptcy is a viable option for\nlarge financial institutions. But far from being unthinkable, bankruptcy can and should be\nworkable. We are already moving toward that goal through the creation of “living wills” for the\nlargest firms, although a tremendous amount of work remains before we can be confident that\nregulators will turn to bankruptcy rather than bailout. Before I discuss that work and its vital\nimportance, let me note that the views expressed are my own and not necessarily the views of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nThe Value of Bankruptcy\nThis audience should be quite familiar with the advantages of the bankruptcy system. Perhaps\nthe most obvious is that a collective proceeding can mitigate the common-pool problems that\narise if individual creditors rush to pursue individual remedies. 2 Judicial oversight of liquidation\nor ongoing management of the bankrupt enterprise can prevent wasteful dissipation of value and\nenhance total creditor returns. In addition, a rules-based system, with safeguards for the\ntreatment of creditors, can provide relatively consistent and predictable outcomes and enable\ncreditors to forecast likely payouts based on their contractual positions and the total value of the\nfirm.\n\n1\n\n\fOf course, this audience should also be familiar with those occasions when reality strays from\nthe ideal. For example, bankruptcy proceedings can be quite costly, in some cases materially\nreducing the net value of the estate. And the ability of some creditors to hold up proceedings can\nlead to departures from the predictability of absolute priority. Nonetheless, despite pockets of\nuncertainty for creditors and debate about particular features of the code, such as those explored\nin the American Bankruptcy Institute’s study of potential reforms to Chapter 11, the bankruptcy\nprocess is one of the best tools we have for effectively reconciling the (ex post) conflicting\nincentives of creditors and debtors.\nThe usual presumption in modern economies is that competitive forces drive parties toward\nfinancial arrangements that are relatively efficient, given the rules of the system they face, in the\nsense that they would be hard to improve upon without making some parties worse off. The\nbankruptcy system reinforces this beneficial feature of competitive markets, since the\ndeadweight costs are borne exclusively by the firm’s creditors and other stakeholders. The result\nis a collective interest, ex ante, in striking an appropriate balance between the probability of\nbankruptcy, with its associated burdens, and the opportunity cost of measures designed to reduce\nthe likelihood of bankruptcy. In particular, there is a collective interest in avoiding ex-ante\ncontractual provisions that would make the firm excessively vulnerable to financial distress.\nThese features of bankruptcy would seem to make it especially valuable in the financial sector,\nwhere firms have a plethora of creditors and where the decentralized pursuit of individual\nremedies ― that is, runs ― can damage a firm’s value, even its ability to continue as a going\nconcern. So why don’t we use a judicial, rules-based system for resolving distressed financial\nfirms?\nThe Origins of “Too Big To Fail”\nThe answer to that question, if I may be blunt, is politics. For much of our history, the U.S.\nbanking system has been highly fragmented due to state laws restricting branching and\ncompetition. As a result, the 27,000-plus banks that were operating at the founding of the Federal\nReserve 100 years ago were unable to diversify risks across regions or head off bank runs by\nmoving funds between branches. Federal deposit insurance was enacted as part of the GlassSteagall Act in 1933 in reaction to the waves of bank failures of the late 1920s and early 1930s. 3\nAt the time, this provision was highly controversial; many policymakers, including President\nRoosevelt and Sen. Carter Glass, were wary of the inherent risk-taking incentives and mindful of\nthe many failed state deposit insurance schemes. But the unit banking system was popular with\npolitically influential populist and agrarian groups, and these forces successfully lobbied instead\nfor a system of government-provided deposit insurance that would preserve the viability of small\nlocal banks by protecting their depositors. 4\nOver time, government protection spread beyond insured bank depositors. Beginning in the early\n1970s, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve began\nintervening in ways that protected uninsured creditors of large financial firms. Penn Central,\nBank of the Commonwealth, Franklin National Bank and Continental Illinois, among others, all\nbenefited from government support. 5 In some cases the FDIC provided funds to arrange mergers\nthat allowed uninsured depositors to avoid losses. In other cases the Fed lent on terms that were\n\n2\n\n\funavailable in the open market. In some cases Fed lending allowed uninsured creditors to\nwithdraw funds while closure was delayed, increasing the loss to the FDIC.\nThese interventions created widespread expectations of government support if a large financial\ninstitution were to become troubled. These expectations dampened incentives to contain risktaking, thus encouraging higher leverage and more reliance on short-term funding. These\nexpectations, along with the relaxation of constraints on consolidation, promoted financial firms\nof greater size, complexity and interconnectedness, making bankruptcy seem even more\nimpractical. And so we had the beginnings of a vicious cycle: Successive generations of\npolicymakers felt compelled to handle financial firm failures outside of bankruptcy, which\nfurther eroded financial firms’ incentives to structure their affairs in a way that facilitated an\norderly bankruptcy. The result was more risky behavior predicated on ad hoc rescues rather than\non clearly defined resolution processes.\nWe came into 2007, then, with two mutually reinforcing conditions firmly entrenched. First,\ninvestors felt protected by an implicit government commitment of support for large financial\ninstitutions in distress. Second, policymakers felt forced to confirm those expectations because\nthey believed failing to rescue creditors would cause a disruptive adjustment of expectations\nregarding support for other entities. The result was excessive reliance on the kind of risky shortterm funding that led to financial market turbulence, followed by government responses that I\nbelieve exacerbated the problem, such as the Fed’s early emergency lending programs and\nfunding for the purchase of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan. 6 When Lehman Brothers filed for\nbankruptcy in September 2008, it could have been an opportunity to establish a new precedent\nagainst bailouts. But instead, within 48 hours, AIG had received an emergency loan from the\nNew York Fed — increasing the policy uncertainty faced by an already-uncertain market. Seven\nyears later, the crisis is behind us, but the expectations that sowed it are alive and well, despite\npolicymakers’ attempts to address them. The question for us now is: What will it take to\ndismantle those expectations?\nThe Orderly Liquidation Authority\nThe chief legislative response to the crisis was the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which purports to\nend “too big to fail” once and for all. The Act includes an array of provisions aimed at reducing\nthe probability of financial distress in the first place. Dodd-Frank provides for enhanced\nsupervision of large financial firms via stronger capital and liquidity requirements, periodic\nstress-testing, counterparty credit limits and risk-management requirements, among other\nmeasures. Beefing up such ex-ante constraints on risk-taking is important and essential, but it's\nnot infallible. Innovative new opportunities for risk-taking will always emerge as financial\nmarkets and economies evolve, and it is asking too much to expect front-line supervisors to\nforever substitute for well-aligned incentives. Moreover, stronger restraints on risk-taking\nincrease the incentive for market participants to find a way to operate beyond the scope of\nregulation. Expanding regulation to chase down fragility wherever it appears is not a promising\nstrategy.\nDodd-Frank also created a new mechanism to resolve large financial firms that become\ndistressed in spite of enhanced supervision. Title II of the Act established the Orderly\n3\n\n\fLiquidation Authority, or OLA, which gives the FDIC the ability, with the agreement of other\nfinancial regulators, to take a firm into receivership. Title II also grants the FDIC a line of credit\nfrom the U.S. Treasury to make payments to creditors of the failed firm or to guarantee the\nliabilities of the failed firm. The funds are to be repaid from recoveries on the assets of the firm\nor, if those are insufficient, from assessments against the largest, most complex financial\ncompanies. 7\nWhile the Title II resolution mechanism borrows many elements from the Bankruptcy Code, in\nmy view it retains many of the critical flaws in ad hoc pre-crisis practices. First, while the FDIC\nmust pay creditors at least what they would be estimated to receive in a traditional bankruptcy\nliquidation proceeding, the Act gives the FDIC the discretion to pay some creditors more than\nthey would obtain in bankruptcy. 8 This creates additional uncertainty for creditors about their\nreturns and potentially allows funds to be channeled to favored creditor classes.\nSecond, the ability to inject funds borrowed from the Treasury allows the FDIC to immediately\npay off creditors whose claims would otherwise be subject to bankruptcy proceedings. This\nmight be viewed as analogous to debtor-in-possession financing in a traditional Chapter 11\nreorganization. Unlike in Chapter 11, however, such government-funded DIP financing would\nnot be subject to the market test applicable to private sector provision and so may be subsidized.\nIn addition, it is not subject to the important checks and balances of the bankruptcy process to\nensure that it enhances the ongoing value of the enterprise to creditors.\nMoreover, using government funds still tilts incentives toward fragile short-term funding and\ndampens creditors’ incentives to monitor risk-taking, in a replay of the vicious cycle I described\na few moments ago. Thus, the Act recreates the same dynamic we saw before and during the\ncrisis: If OLA support for the creditors of financially distressed institutions is widely anticipated\nor assumed, the FDIC will likely feel forced to provide that support to avoid the turbulence\ncaused by disappointed expectations.\nOver the past two years, the FDIC has articulated a strategy for implementing Title II — known\nas the “single point of entry”— that is likely to enhance expectations of government support. 9\nThis strategy focuses intervention on the holding company. If regulators determine that a\nfinancial institution should be resolved under Title II, the FDIC would be appointed receiver of\nthe top-tier parent company, while the subsidiaries remain open and operating. The FDIC would\nthen set up a bridge company into which it would transfer certain assets from the receivership,\nprimarily the parent’s investments and equity interests in subsidiaries. The FDIC envisions\neventually transferring ownership of the bridge company to the private sector. The expectation is\nthat the parent company shareholders would be wiped out, and the claims of parent company\ncreditors would be converted into equity and debt in the new entity.\nThere are other important details of the FDIC’s single point of entry strategy that I will skip over\nin the interests of time, but one observation deserves mention. 10 Unlike the FDIC’s guarantee\nprograms of 2008 and 2009, when the corporation guaranteed the newly issued senior debt of all\nFDIC-insured institutions, single point of entry might be described as a “bail in” rather than a\nbailout. That’s because the primary source of equity capital for the new holding company comes\nfrom the unsecured holders of the parent company’s debt. Still, it seems regrettable to have to\n4\n\n\fidentify one class of creditors that is eligible for losses, with the presumption being that all others\nreceive support, rather than the usual approach of providing explicit government guarantees,\nsuch as deposit insurance, to some creditors and presuming that all others are at risk. Broad\nprotection for so many subsidiary creditors seems likely to weaken market discipline and\nexacerbate the too-big-to-fail dynamic that led to the crisis.\nA Better Strategy: Living Wills\nAnother provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, however, provides a much more promising strategy\nfor ending “too big to fail.” Section 165(d) in Title I requires large and complex financial\ninstitutions to create resolution plans, also known as \"living wills.\" 11 These are detailed plans\nthat explain how a financial institution could be wound down under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code\nwithout threatening the rest of the financial system or requiring government assistance. Under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, large banks and other systemically important firms are required to submit\nthese plans on an annual basis for review by the Fed and the FDIC.\nResolution planning provides a structured approach for understanding what's likely to happen in\nthe event that a large financial firm should fail. In contrast, in past crises policymakers found\nthemselves with little or no preparatory work to draw on. In fact, resolution planning has proven\nvaluable already by giving firms a better and more detailed understanding of their own legal\nstructures, and many have used the process to reorganize themselves and eliminate unneeded\nlegal entities.\nResolution planning wisely does not take the current operating profile of large financial firms as\ngiven; the current characteristics of these firms evolved in response to the precedents set by\nregulators avoiding the use of bankruptcy. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that if the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC jointly determine that a plan would not credibly facilitate an orderly\nresolution under the Bankruptcy Code, the firm is required to submit a revised plan to address\nidentified deficiencies. If the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not\nremedy identified deficiencies, they can require more capital, increase liquidity requirements or\nrestrict the growth, activities or operations of the firm. They can even require firms to make\ndivestitures.\nOn August 5, the Fed and the FDIC announced the completion of reviews of the second round of\nresolution plans submitted in 2013 by the 11 banks that make up the first group of filers. These\nfirms submitted their original plans in 2012. 12 In a joint announcement, the agencies noted the\nbanks had made some significant improvements from their first submissions. 13\nBut the agencies also outlined areas where substantial further work remains. One shortcoming, to\nquote the announcement, is “the failure to make, or even to identify, the kinds of changes in firm\nstructure and practices that would be necessary to enhance the prospects for orderly resolution.”\nIn other words, these firms are still far too complex to be feasibly resolved under the Bankruptcy\nCode, and so they have been directed to establish a “rational and less complex legal structure.”\nOne aspect of structural complexity is the existence of substantial operations that cross multiple\nlegal and regulatory jurisdictions, thus potentially requiring interaction with multiple regulators.\n5\n\n\fOne useful approach to this problem may be to enhance separability by making an institution’s\noperations in a given jurisdiction more self-contained and self-supporting. In the event of\ndistress, regulators would then be able to resolve operations in a single jurisdiction with fewer\ncomplications and without relying on cross-border cooperation among regulators. Documenting\nand limiting dependence on services or funding from other affiliated companies within the\norganization can minimize disruptions in the event of a bankruptcy filing. Making cross-border\noperations more separable certainly could be costly in “normal times,” but that cost is just\nanother manifestation of the subsidy inherent in “too big to fail.”\nAnother concern raised by the Fed and the FDIC is how these firms would assure the continuity\nof critical operations and core business lines. In a typical reorganization, a failing company\nmight obtain DIP financing to fund continuing operations. Because complex financial institutions\nhave typically been quite reliant on short-term funding, their DIP financing needs are potentially\nquite large relative to historic precedents for privately provided DIP funding. But financial firms\nhave reduced their potential financing needs substantially since the crisis by building up their\nliquid asset buffers and shedding illiquid assets. Further reductions in dependence on short-term\nfunding may be needed to ensure that DIP financing plans are credible.\nNote, however, that reliance on government sources for DIP financing, such as borrowing from\nthe Fed’s discount window, would conflict with the obvious purpose of the statute. Government\nfunding, unless identical terms are available from the private sector, represents a subsidy that\ndistorts returns and encourages excessive risk-taking. Expectations of such support are what gave\nrise to the vulnerabilities that induce government support in a crisis. Including such support in\nresolution plans is incompatible with ending “too big to fail.”\nCertainly, the needed alterations to the structure and operations of large financial firms will be\nunpopular with those firms since they are likely to involve reductions in reliance on short-term\nfunding and the adoption of more easily severable subsidiary structures. But I believe the\nchanges that could result from living wills are feasible without sacrificing the inherent benefits\nlarge financial firms provide to the economy. The credibility of living wills would be\ncompromised, in my view, by continuing to depend on government backstops in order to avoid\nneeded changes.\nIn addition to requiring financial firms to adapt their operations to the Bankruptcy Code, we\nshould also look for ways to better adapt the Bankruptcy Code to financial firms. One proposed\nreform seeks to vest the firm’s losses solely in the parent company, similar to the single-point-ofentry strategy I described earlier. Because it protects the creditors of the subsidiaries, however,\nthis strategy might not be the most effective means to restore market discipline. Other work has\nhighlighted the fact that many short-term financing instruments and derivatives are exempt from\nbankruptcy's automatic stay. This safe harbor treatment arguably over-encourages the use of such\ninstruments and thereby enhances the growth and fragility of shadow banking. Some have\nproposed limiting this exemption as well as adding a new chapter to the Bankruptcy Code\nspecifically adapted to large financial firms. 14 These reform proposals strike me as compelling\nand worthy of serious consideration.\nAchieving Credibility\n6\n\n\fResolution planning for large, complex financial firms is difficult, painstaking work — but it is\nalso vitally important to breaking the mutually reinforcing expectations of government support.\nRegulator acceptance of credible resolution plans will imply a commitment to use them in cases\nof financial distress. Explicit regulatory statements to that effect would be constructive, as would\nmuch greater public visibility into the details of the plans, so investors can judge credibility for\nthemselves and assess how their claims would be treated. The joint Fed-FDIC announcement on\nAugust 5 stated that the agencies would be working with the firms to “explore ways to enhance\npublic transparency of future plan submissions.”\nIf we do the hard work to make the plans credible, and if regulators and policymakers commit\npublicly to using them, I believe we will begin to see a healthy realignment of private sector\nexpectations regarding the likelihood of government intervention and a concomitant\nimprovement in the incentives facing financial firms and their investors. Of course, that\nrealignment may not be complete until commitment is demonstrated by actually letting a big\nfinancial firm file for bankruptcy.\nI also believe, however, that as long as regulators retain the discretion to intervene with\ngovernment funding, the credibility of resolution plans will be at risk. Seemingly urgent shortrun considerations will threaten to overshadow the value of establishing and preserving a record\nof precedents that keep market expectations well-anchored. This is a particular danger for central\nbanks, whose independent balance sheets place their fiscal actions beyond the scope of the\nlegislative appropriations process. 15 Credible commitment to orderly unassisted resolutions thus\nmay require eliminating the power of governmental entities to provide ad hoc rescues. This\nwould mean repealing the Federal Reserve's remaining emergency lending powers and further\nrestraining the Fed’s ability to lend to failing institutions. And once robust and credible\nresolution plans are in place, we would be able to responsibly wind down the FDIC's Orderly\nLiquidation Authority and related financing mechanisms.\nConclusion\nThis afternoon, I have discussed several valuable aspects of the bankruptcy process, including its\nability to provide relatively consistent and predictable outcomes and to address the common-pool\nproblems that arise when a firm has multiple creditors. In addition, bankruptcy promotes a\ncollective interest in limiting risky financial arrangements. For these reasons, bankruptcy would\nseem to be especially advantageous for financial firms. Yet regulators have repeatedly chosen to\nhandle distressed firms outside the bankruptcy process, which has led to a buildup of\nexpectations of government support when large financial firms become troubled. These\nexpectations, in my view, were a major contributing factor to the financial crisis.\nIn my view, living wills offer us the only realistic path to dismantling those expectations and\nending “too big to fail.” While they have not received as much attention as other regulatory and\nlegislative responses to the crisis, they may be the most critical, and I applaud the hard work that\nis being done to make them credible. It will be a long journey, and we should expect resistance to\nthe changes that will be required. But the costliness of those changes is a measure of the\nsubsidies inherent in the bailout-dependent too-big-to-fail regime, a regime that is unworkable,\n7\n\n\funsustainable and unfair. The health and stability of our financial system depends on rethinking\nthe once-unthinkable possibility of bankruptcy for large financial firms.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero, Kartik Athreya and John Walter for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nThomas H.

            "content": "Prospects for Growth and Labor Markets\nOctober 9, 2014\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nBiltmore Estate, Asheville Regional Forum\nAsheville, North Carolina\nIt’s a pleasure to speak with you today. My colleagues and I have spent the last day and a half\nlearning more about economic developments in the Asheville region. Trips like these are very\nhelpful to us at the Richmond Fed. As we sift through reams of economic data to try to make\nsense of what’s happening in our economy, it’s exceptionally important to complement that\ninformation with what we hear from the members of our community. It gives us a sense of why\nthings are happening and what people expect for the future, which is vital to our understanding\nof where the national economy is heading.\nI will be talking today about the national economic picture. 1 I’ll talk about why economic growth\nstrikes many observers as disappointing. I’ll spend some time on labor market conditions in\nparticular, since they’ve been a special focus of attention for many. Finally, I’ll wrap up with a\nfew remarks about prospects for monetary policy. Before I begin, though, I need to note that the\nviews expressed are my own and do not represent the official views of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nTo make sense of the most recent information on economic activity, it helps to start with a look\nat longer-run trends. We are now in the sixth year of expansion following the Great Recession,\nand most observers have been surprised and disappointed by the slow pace of that expansion.\nSince the recession ended in June 2009, real GDP ― our broadest measure of overall economic\nactivity ― has grown at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent. In contrast, in the 60 years before\nthe recession, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent. That lengthy period of\nrapid growth gave us a strong sense that normal growth is at least 3 percent and anything less is a\ncause for concern. And after the recession ended, that sense has led many forecasters, myself\nincluded, to predict repeatedly that growth was about to shift to a more robust pace. That just\nhasn’t happened; we’ve seen short-lived surges in growth, only to see growth subside for the\nfollowing couple of quarters. For example, real GDP surged over the second half of last year\nonly to falter at the beginning of this year.\nThis experience has led me to conclude that a sustained increase in growth to something over 3\npercent in the near future is unlikely. Given what we know, after more than five years of this\nexpansion, it strikes me as more likely that growth will continue to average somewhere between\n2 and 2 ½ percent. Let me explain why.\nIt is useful to start by thinking of the growth in real GDP as the sum of two components: growth\nin employment and growth in real GDP per employee, which is a measure of productivity\ngrowth. When you calculate these two components, you find that both growth rates peaked\n1\n\n\fseveral decades ago and had slowed considerably even before the Great Recession began. Since\nthe recession ended in the second quarter of 2009, both growth rates have been relatively low.\nGoing forward, is it likely that either employment or productivity will accelerate significantly?\nLet’s look at employment first. Employment growth from the 1970s through the 1990s averaged\nclose to 2 percent per year due to high population growth and rising labor force participation,\nmainly attributable to women entering the labor force. But even before the Great Recession,\npopulation growth and labor force participation had started to decline, resulting in lower\nemployment growth. And the aging of the baby boomer generation means that a larger fraction\nof the workforce is older and thus less likely to look for work. So for the next few years, a\nrelatively slow rate of employment growth would not be surprising.\nTurning to productivity, growth in output per worker averaged slightly above a 3 percent annual\nrate in the 1950s, fell sharply in the 1970s, rebounded somewhat in the 1990s and has fallen\nsubstantially since then. The longer-run productivity outlook is a subject of active debate. 2\nProfessor Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University has argued that several distinct\n“headwinds,” such as stagnating educational attainment and growing government debt, are likely\nto limit the growth of productivity for at least the next several decades. 3 In his view, the\ntremendous productivity gains of the last two centuries have largely reflected the dissemination\nof just a few extraordinary innovations, such as electricity and internal combustion engines, and\nhe sees no signs of any breakthroughs of similar magnitude. Taking the other side, Professor Joel\nMokyr, also at Northwestern University, is more optimistic.4 He notes that economic innovations\nare notoriously hard to predict, and that science and technology are moving in heretofore\nunimagined directions — directions that are very difficult to measure using our standard\nframeworks. He foresees substantial improvements in our standard of living, even if it is some\ntime before those improvements are reflected in our national income accounts.\nMy own view leans to the more hopeful end of the spectrum. I do believe that the economics\nprofession has only a limited quantitative understanding of the process by which new ideas\nemerge, diffuse and are adopted. So it’s hard for me to rule out the notion that a good-sized pool\nof innovations lies ahead for us to uncover and deploy. Perhaps the more critical question is\nwhether we are well positioned to do so or whether recent policy shifts may have dampened the\nincentive to implement innovations.\nFor purposes of projecting economic conditions over the next several years, I think the safest bet\nis that near-term productivity growth will closely resemble the recent past, growing at around 1\npercent per year. In short, neither the employment component nor the productivity component\nsuggests that real GDP is likely to accelerate significantly in the near future.\nAs a complement to this perspective, let’s take a look at things from the spending side of the\nledger. Consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of GDP, is a good place to start.\nSince the end of the recession, consumer spending has grown at an average annual rate of 2.2\npercent, the same as real GDP. Year to date, consumer spending has also increased at a 2.2\npercent annual rate. Since this is fairly well aligned with the trend in real disposable income,\nthere are good reasons to doubt a sudden surge in consumer spending. U.S. households appear to\nremain mindful of the unexpectedly dramatic losses in income and wealth experienced during the\n2\n\n\fGreat Recession, and they’ve been cautious about expanding spending as a result. I expect that\ncaution to continue.\nSome observers continue to forecast rapid growth in residential construction expenditures. Since\nthe end of the recession, residential investment has risen at a solid 5.6 percent annual rate. Still,\nthat leaves important measures of housing activity well below levels seen before the housing\nboom. So far this year, the annual rate of new single-family housing starts has been barely half of\nthe 1.3 million units built annually, on average, between 1995 and 2007. With home construction\nrunning so far below traditional benchmarks, it would seem natural to expect an enormous pentup demand to lead to a surge in new construction. That hasn’t happened yet, and one can see\ngood reasons why not. Since the recession, we all have a greater appreciation for the risks\nassociated with the boom/bust cycle in housing activity, and this is bound to curb households’\nenthusiasm for making highly leveraged investments in single-family homes. Moreover,\nhousing-related credit is not available as widely or on as generous terms as during the boom.\nThese factors, along with households’ general post-recession cautiousness, seem likely to\ncontinue the shift toward multifamily rental housing. So while overall residential investment\nshould continue to grow at a solid pace, one shouldn’t expect to see the single-family market\nreturn to pre-recession norms very soon.\nI won’t subject you to an encyclopedic tour of the other categories of aggregate spending; suffice\nit to say that I don’t see signs of accelerating economic activity there either. And so my outlook\nis for real GDP to continue to grow in a 2 to 2 ½ percent range.\nGrowth in that range represents a step down from what was typical in the last half of the 20th\ncentury and thus might provide a less effervescent experience for businesses and consumers.\nNonetheless, given the challenges we face, we should take some satisfaction in the good\neconomic progress it represents. For example, if growth continues through the end of next year,\nas virtually all economic forecasters are projecting, this will become the fourth longest expansion\nsince World War II. And if productivity growth comes in at, say, 1 ¼ percent, our average\nstandard of living would double in the space of 55 years, which looks good in comparison with\nmost periods in our recorded history.\nOver the last five years, growth in overall activity at about the pace that I am projecting has\nresulted in substantial improvement in labor market conditions. Since the end of the recession,\nwe have added 8.5 million net new jobs, according to the survey of employers. That pace of job\ngrowth was rapid enough to bring the unemployment rate from 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.9\npercent in September. 5\nSome economists have argued that the decline in the unemployment rate overstates the\nimprovement in labor market conditions. They point out the large number of workers who say\nthey want to work but do not satisfy the official definition of unemployed because they are not\nactively looking for work. These “marginally attached” workers, many of whom have given up\nsearching for work because they are discouraged about job prospects, represent an additional\ndegree of labor underutilization beyond that captured by the standard unemployment rate. 6 In\naddition, there are many people who are working part time but would prefer full-time\nemployment and who therefore also represent additional underutilization. This has led some\n3\n\n\feconomists to prefer to focus on a broader measure of labor market underutilization called U-6,\nwhich in addition to the unemployed includes people who are marginally attached to the labor\nforce and who are working part time for economic reasons. The U-6 rate is of course higher than\nthe standard unemployment rate, and it remains elevated.\nThis has been a fertile area for economic research, particularly for Federal Reserve economists,\nincluding some at the Richmond Fed. In recent years, economists have been able to learn a lot\nfrom some very large datasets on the transitions of individual workers between employment and\nunemployment, and into and out of the labor force. These insights have complemented earlier\nwork focused more on the “stocks” of workers in various categories each month.\nI would like to highlight some work by Richmond Fed economists Andreas Hornstein and\nMarianna Kudlyak and Professor Fabian Lange of McGill University. In a recent paper they\nauthored with Tim Sablik of the Richmond Fed, they have developed a new and intuitively\nappealing approach to estimating the extent of labor underutilization. 7 Their method is based on\nthe observation that people who are not employed differ in the likelihood of making the\ntransition to employment from one month to the next. For example, based on data from 1994 to\n2013, a retiree had a 1.4 percent likelihood of becoming employed. In contrast, a person who had\nbeen unemployed for less than half a year ― that is, one of the “short-term unemployed” ― had\na 28 percent chance of becoming employed. They find that workers who want a job but don’t\nmeet the criteria for being unemployed do have a good chance of being drawn into employment\nin any given month. The probability for this group is 13 percent ― lower than for the short-term\nunemployed but not as low as for retirees.\nTheir measure of labor market underutilization takes these differences into account. They\nconstruct what they call a Non-Employment Index by taking each category of persons who are\nnot working and weighting them by their propensities to become employed. This provides a\nunified framework for viewing the non-employed population that addresses many of the\nobjections that have been raised to the conventional unemployment rate. They also take an\nimproved approach to incorporating part-time workers by taking into account that the\nunderutilization of a person working 20 hours per week is less than the underutilization of a\nperson working zero hours.\nMovements in their Non-Employment Index over time closely track movements in the\nconventional unemployment rate. In the latest episode, both rose sharply in the recession and\nhave declined since, but both indexes remain above the levels seen just prior to the recession. An\nimportant finding of theirs is that the relation between the Non-Employment Index and the\nunemployment rate seems to have remained stable over time. In particular, the Non-Employment\nIndex is about where it should be based on past episodes when the standard unemployment rate\nwas about 5.9 percent.\nThis research supports the conclusion that the standard unemployment rate by itself is still a\nreliable indicator of the degree of labor underutilization. There is more underutilization than\ncaptured by the unemployment rate, but there always is, and there seems to be no more now than\nis typical when the unemployment rate is where it is now.\n\n4\n\n\fI’d like to conclude with some thoughts on inflation and monetary policy. My remarks on\ninflation can be short because inflation has been fairly well behaved. Over the last 20 years, the\nFed’s preferred estimate of the price level, the price index for personal consumption expenditure,\nhas risen at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent. For reference, the Fed’s stated inflation goal is\n2 percent. Over shorter intervals there have been swings in inflation around that 2 percent rate.\nLast year, for example, inflation was only 1.2 percent, which was notably below target and raised\nthe possibility of persistent, excessive disinflation in the minds of some observers. This year,\nhowever, prices have risen at a 1.6 percent annual rate through the first eight months. I expect\ninflation to continue to gradually converge to the Fed’s 2 percent target. Thankfully, there are no\nsigns that business and consumer expectations for future inflation have drifted away from 2\npercent. Of course, monetary policy must ensure that we never see such a drift in expectations\nmaterialize, for if it does, it will have been too late.\nSpeaking of monetary policy, at the end of 2008 the Fed lowered its target for the federal funds\nrate to near zero. Since then, it has purchased large quantities of longer-term Treasury securities\nand mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage\ncompanies now under government conservatorship. As a result, the Fed’s balance sheet has risen\nfrom about $900 billion in 2007 to around $4.4 trillion today.\nBarring unforeseen circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to\nannounce the end of the asset purchase program at the conclusion of its next meeting on October\n29. At its last meeting, the FOMC released a statement summarizing its current thinking on the\nways in which it would normalize the stance of monetary policy and its security holdings in the\nyears ahead. 8 The discussions that led to the statement were part of prudent planning and do not\nimply that normalization will necessarily begin soon.\nThe basic plan is to normalize monetary policy by first raising interest rates, while leaving asset\nholdings unchanged. The primary instrument for moving the federal funds rate into the\nCommittee’s target range will be the interest rate that the Fed pays on excess reserve holdings at\ncommercial banks. Currently this is 25 basis points, and the federal funds rate trades within the\nzero-to-25-basis-point target range. At some point after the initial increase in the funds rate target\nrange, Committee participants believe they will stop reinvesting principal repayments from the\nFed’s securities holdings, which would result in a gradual and predictable decline in the size of\nits portfolio.\nI support the planned approach to conducting interest rate policy when the time comes to raise\nrates. I also support the Committee’s statement that the Fed will in due course hold no more\nsecurities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that it\nwill hold primarily Treasury securities, thereby minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve\nholdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.\nI could not support, however, the Committee’s planned approach to moving the Fed’s balance\nsheet toward its normal state. In particular, the statement says that the Committee currently does\nnot anticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities. I believe this approach unnecessarily\nprolongs our interference in the allocation of credit. The Fed’s MBS holdings may put downward\npressure on mortgage rates, compared to holding an equivalent amount of Treasury securities. If\n5\n\n\fso, then other borrowers would likely face higher interest rates. While this would favor home\nmortgage borrowers, it tilts the playing field against borrowers in other economic sectors, such as\nbusinesses and renters.\nI believe that selling assets, particularly mortgage-backed securities, should be an active\ncomponent of the normalization process in order to reduce the Fed’s role in credit allocation as\nrapidly as possible. The desire to avoid this type of credit allocation is a long-standing principle\nin the conduct of U.S. monetary policy. 9 It was reaffirmed in a joint statement with the Treasury\non March 23, 2009, that states, “Actions taken by the Federal Reserve should also aim to\nimprove financial or credit conditions broadly, not to allocate credit to narrowly-defined sectors\nor classes of borrowers.” 10 I fully agree with that statement. Tilting the flow of credit to favored\nborrowers at the expense of others is inappropriate and unnecessary to the conduct of monetary\npolicy.\nI may be something of a stickler for principle in this regard, but that’s because I view the\nextraordinary independence of modern central banks like the Fed as a unique privilege. It has\nproven essential for conducting monetary policy with a longer-run focus and maintaining\nmonetary stability. Central bank independence will be precarious, however, without clear\nboundaries around the use of independent balance sheets for credit market intervention.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roy Webb, Andreas Hornstein, Jessie Romero and Alex Wolman for assistance preparing\nthese remarks.\n2\nJohn A.

            "content": "Press Releases\nSept. 19, 2014\n\nRichmond Fed President Jeffrey M. Lacker Comments on\nPolicy Normalization Principles and Plans\nRichmond, Va.\n\n\"At the end of its meeting on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee released a\nstatement on policy normalization principles and plans . This statement was the result of the\nCommittee’s discussions over recent meetings regarding ways to normalize the stance of\nmonetary policy and the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. I did not support the full\nstatement. Specifically, I did not support plans for the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet.\n\"I support the planned approach to conducting interest rate policy when the time comes to raise\nrates. This part of the statement describes the tools the Committee will use to influence the\nfederal funds rate and other short-term interest rates. The interest rate paid on excess reserves\nwill be adjusted to move the federal funds rate into the target range established by the\nCommittee. The overnight reverse repurchase facility will be a backstop, used only as\nnecessary, and will be phased out when no longer needed.\n\"I also support the principle that the Federal Reserve will, in due course, hold no more securities\nthan necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that it will hold\nprimarily Treasury securities, thereby minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve holdings on the\nallocation of credit across sectors of the economy.\n\"I cannot support the Committee’s planned approach to moving the Fed’s balance sheet toward\nits normal state, however. In particular, the statement says that the Committee currently does not\nanticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). I believe this approach\nunnecessarily prolongs our interference in the allocation of credit. The Fed’s MBS holdings may\nput downward pressure on mortgage rates, compared to holding an equivalent amount of\nTreasury securities, but if so, then other borrowers would likely face higher interest rates. While\nthis would favor home mortgage borrowers, it tilts the playing field against other borrowing by\nconsumers.\n\"The desire to avoid such effects is a long-standing principle in the conduct of U.S. monetary\npolicy over the last half-century (Haltom and Sharp 2014) and is articulated in the Committee’s\nGuidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations . On March 23, 2009, the\nFederal Reserve and the Treasury reaffirmed this principle in a Joint Statement : “Actions taken\nby the Federal Reserve should also aim to improve financial or credit conditions broadly, not to\nallocate credit to narrowly-defined sectors or classes of borrowers. Government decisions to\ninfluence the allocation of credit are the province of the fiscal authorities.”\n\"I agree with the Joint Statement. Interference in the allocation of credit by altering relative\ninterest rates, and thus tilting the flow of credit toward some sectors and away from others, is an\ninappropriate use of the central bank’s balance sheet. It is unnecessary to the conduct of\n\n\fmonetary policy, the central bank’s primary responsibility, and involves distributional choices that\nshould be made through the democratic process and carried out by fiscal authorities, not by an\nindependent central bank.\n\"The Fed’s statutory mandate of price stability and maximum employment would be best served,\nI believe, by a well-articulated plan to actively reduce our holdings of MBS through sales at a\nsteady, predictable pace.\"\nThe Richmond Fed serves the Fifth Federal Reserve District, which includes the District of\nColumbia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and most of West Virginia.

Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharlotte Plaza Uptown Hotel, Rotary Club of Charlotte\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nThank you for that kind introduction, Dave. We at the Richmond Fed really appreciate your\nservice as a director at our Charlotte branch. Many people are not aware that the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks are separate legal entities with their own separate boards. Our directors perform a\ntremendously valuable service by keeping us informed on a regular basis about economic\ndevelopments in their locality or industry. Official statistical reports are vital to the policy\nprocess, of course, but by themselves, they’re simply not enough. Our directors and other\ncontacts provide us with a wealth of timely information about the expectations and plans of\nbusinesses and consumers around the country. Reserve Bank presidents regularly relay those\nreports to our colleagues at FOMC meetings, and they provide critical insights into unfolding\neconomic developments. So we are very grateful for the service of directors like Dave\nZimmerman. 1\nThe decentralized structure of the Federal Reserve dates back to the founding of the Fed\nprecisely 100 years ago. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act on\nDecember 23, 1913. Work then began to organize the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.,\nand the 12 Reserve Banks around the country, which opened for business on November 16,\n1914. The founding of the Federal Reserve System was the culmination of decades of debate on\nan array of proposals for banking and currency reform. 2 Before moving on to discuss the\neconomic outlook, I want to highlight two aspects of those debates for you in order to illustrate\nthe continuing relevance of our history for contemporary controversies. If you’re interested in\nlearning more, I urge you to visit federalreservehistory.org, a new website that we’ve introduced\nto help make our history more accessible. 3 I should mention at the outset, though, that my\nremarks reflect my own views and do not represent the official views of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nOne of the most hotly debated aspects of the founding of the Fed was the number and location of\nthe Reserve Banks themselves. I have been reminded of this from time to time on visits to\nCharlotte when the executive of a certain large financial institution headquartered here would\nteasingly ask me: “When are you going to relocate the headquarters of the Richmond Fed to\nCharlotte?” No such plans are being contemplated, although it is true that Richmond, which was\none of the most prominent financial centers of the South a century ago, has been eclipsed as a\nbanking hub by the Queen City. We do maintain a substantial operational presence here,\nhowever, in the form of our branch office at the corner of Trade and Caldwell, catty-corner from\nthe Bobcats’ arena.*\n\n1\n\n\fThe broader question in play 100 years ago, however, was how many Reserve Banks would there\nbe? 4 One early version of the Federal Reserve Act would have created a single Reserve Bank\nwith branches around the country. This was unacceptable to the populists, however, and it tapped\ninto the deep-rooted 19th century American hostility to large financial institutions and financial\ncenter interests. Instead, the Act established a decentralized system of regional Reserve Banks,\nalong with an agency, now known as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nappointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate, to oversee the\noperations and policies of the Reserve Banks.\nThe Federal Reserve thus was given a hybrid public-private governance structure. At times in\nour history, this has helped insulate the Fed from electoral political pressures that can induce an\nexcessively short-run focus. That independence has been particularly critical in efforts to keep\ninflation under control. But such independence comes with a responsibility to be accountable to\nour institutions of democratic governance for the results of our policy conduct.\nReflecting on the Fed’s creation also illuminates its mission. The Federal Reserve was founded\nin response to banking panics, which were common in the late 1800s and culminated in the\nfamous Panic of 1907. During banking panics, a surge of concerned depositors would attempt to\nconvert their deposits into currency, at times leading banks to suspend withdrawals and thereby\ndisrupt the payments system.\nTwo intertwined problems were to blame. First, the U.S. banking system was incredibly\nfragmented. Legal restrictions on branching meant there were over 27,000 individual banks when\nthe Fed was founded, many of them small rural banks that were highly vulnerable to local and\nregional shocks. 5 Second, provisions of the Civil War-era National Banking Acts required that\npaper currency, which was issued by banks, had to be backed by U.S. government bonds. The\ncumbersome process for posting collateral meant that the supply of currency could not always\nexpand rapidly when withdrawal demand surged. This forced banks to suspend withdrawals and\nencouraged depositor runs in anticipation of such suspensions.\nCongress therefore created the Fed to “furnish an elastic currency,” in the words of the Act; that\nis, to stand ready to expand the currency supply in response to increases in demand. Originally,\nthe Reserve Banks supplied additional currency by lending to banks, but over time purchases of\ngovernment securities in the open market became the primary method of regulating the money\nsupply. The Fed’s lending authority was originally provided as a means of regulating the supply\nof money ― in other words, conducting monetary policy. A careful reading of history suggests\nthat the Fed’s founders did not envision targeted lending that allocated credit to specific\nborrowers or market segments, as the Fed did during the 2007-08 financial crisis. In other words,\nthe Fed was founded to solve a monetary problem, not to rescue failing institutions.\nThe continued relevance of these two issues ― the Fed’s independence and its problematic\nlending authority ― vividly illustrates the value of understanding our history. This is why I\nbelieve it is so important to make the history of the Federal Reserve accessible to the public, so\nresearchers, journalists and interested citizens can explore the past, examine the original sources,\ndeepen their understanding and perhaps even contribute to the debates.

I’ll start by noting that you can be forgiven for\nbeing confused by the news coverage of the economy in recent weeks: The economy shrank at a\n2.9 percent rate in the first quarter, we learned, and yet employment continues to rise at a fairly\nstrong pace. In my view, the employment report is far more representative of economic trends\nthan the depressed first quarter GDP measure.\nInstead of getting caught up in the chatter about the latest month’s numbers, however, I think it’s\nuseful to take a step back for a broader perspective. Last month marks the end of the fifth year of\nthe economic expansion that began following the Great Recession, and most observers have been\nsurprised and disappointed by the slow pace of that expansion. Since the end of the recession,\nreal GDP has grown at an average annual rate of just 2.1 percent. In contrast, in the 60 years\nbefore the recession, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent. Based in part on\nthat long track record, many forecasters, myself included, were expecting growth to pick up to a\nmore robust pace. More recently, however, I have come to the conclusion that a sustained\nacceleration of growth to something over 3 percent in the near future is unlikely. Given what we\nknow, it strikes me as more likely that growth will continue to average somewhere between 2\nand 2 1/2 percent. Let me briefly explain why.\nIt’s helpful to start by thinking of the growth in real GDP as the sum of two components: growth\nin employment and growth in GDP per employee, a measure of productivity growth. When you\ncalculate these two components, you find that both have slowed considerably since the Great\nRecession.\nTaking these in turn, the rate of growth in employment has been about two-thirds of the rate we\nsaw in the decades prior to the Great Recession. Part of that decline reflects structural\ndevelopments such as slower growth in the working-age population, the aging of the baby\nboomers and the rise of enrollment in educational institutions. In addition, we’ve seen a gradual\nsecular decline in the labor force participation rates for people in the prime working-age group\naged 25 to 54. Some economists attribute this to workers becoming discouraged about their job\nmarket prospects and argue that the unemployment rate is understating the amount of “slack” in\nthe labor market. Our research indicates, however, that there is always more slack than indicated\nby the standard unemployment rate, and by some measures there seems to be no more additional\nslack now than is typically associated with the current level of the unemployment rate. 6\nProductivity growth, the other component of real GDP, grew fairly rapidly in the early postwar\nperiod, rising at a 2.7 percent annual rate from 1948 to 1969. Productivity growth then slowed,\nrising at a 1.4 percent annual rate from 1969 to 2007. And since the fourth quarter of 2007,\nproductivity growth has averaged only 1.0 percent per year.\nAn active debate has sprung up concerning prospects for future productivity growth. Some\neconomists have suggested that major, broad-based advances in technology are far less likely\nthan in the past, and that we should prepare for a relatively stagnant productivity trend. 7 I am not\n3\n\n\fso gloomy, however, in large part because of the amazing historical record of technological\ninnovations that solve current problems and simultaneously open up new possibilities for future\ninnovations. 8 Having said that, the difficulty of forecasting output per worker suggests that the\nmiddling productivity gains we’ve seen over the last few years are probably the best guide to\nnear-term productivity trends. Thus, I am not expecting an imminent acceleration in productivity\ngrowth.\nProductivity growth is critically important because it’s what drives growth in real wages and real\nhousehold income, which in turn ultimately drives consumer spending. Some proponents of the\nview that GDP growth will soon accelerate argue that a pickup in productivity growth will boost\ndisposable income trends and thereby set off an acceleration in consumer spending. Data earlier\nin the year seemed to indicate that such an acceleration might be in train. More recent household\nspending figures suggest otherwise, however. Indeed, consumer spending fell in real terms in\nboth April and May, and is up a little less than 2 percent year-over-year. U.S. consumers seem to\nremain chastened by the memory of unexpectedly dramatic losses in income and wealth\nexperienced during the Great Recession, and they’ve been cautious about expanding spending as\na result. So it’s hard to see a significant acceleration in consumer spending on the horizon.\nThe housing market has also perplexed forecasters over the course of this expansion. During the\nboom, we built more houses than we needed. Housing construction then plunged, and while\ngrowth has resumed, the level of new construction remains well below what we used to consider\nnormal. I believe it could be a while before we get back there. Potential homebuyers now seem\nto be more conscious of the financial risks of homeownership than before, and housing demand\nhas been shifting toward multifamily rental units. Moreover, the overhang of homes associated\nwith foreclosures and seriously delinquent mortgages remains elevated, and this is dampening\nhousing market activity. Thus, I am expecting residential investment to make only modest\ncontributions to overall growth over the near term.\nThese three factors ― subdued productivity growth, moderate consumer spending growth and a\nmore tempered expansion in housing construction ― are keys to my assessment that overall\neconomic growth is likely to average between 2 and 2 ½ percent over the near term, which is\naround the average rate we’ve seen for this expansion.\nThe outlook for inflation is also quite important to us, since, as I noted earlier, monetary stability\nhas always been the Fed’s primary mission. The Federal Open Market Committee is on record as\nstating that its goal is for the price index for personal consumption expenditures to rise at an\nannual rate of 2 percent. Many observers expressed concern last year that inflation, at about 1 ¼\npercent, was running well below the FOMC’s target. Inflation has averaged 2 ½ percent over the\nlast three months, however. While the inflation numbers will often run hot or cold for several\nmonths at a time, the latest numbers suggest that inflation has bottomed out and is moving\ntoward the Committee’s target. I expect that firming trend to continue this year.\nI will wrap things up now with a few remarks about monetary policy. The federal funds rate has\nbeen near zero for over five years and the size of our balance sheet has risen more than fivefold\nsince 2007. We’re continuing to expand our balance sheet, but we’ve been gradually reducing\n\n4\n\n\fthe pace of expansion and are on track to end asset purchases before the end of the year. That\nwill leave us holding well over $4 trillion of government and mortgage-related securities.\nBy expanding our balance sheet, we have flooded the banking system with reserves. At some\npoint the economy will have improved enough that banks could increase lending substantially,\nleading to rapid deposit growth and mounting inflationary pressures. In order to prevent those\npressures from emerging and to keep inflation averaging 2 percent, we will need to begin\nwithdrawing monetary stimulus at the appropriate time. One way to do that is to begin raising\ninterest rates. According to material published as part of the FOMC’s economic projections in\nJune, most FOMC participants believe that the federal funds rate will most likely begin rising\nsometime next year. It’s also worth pointing out that most participants expect inflation at or\nbelow the FOMC’s 2 percent target next year. This is consistent with the FOMC’s past practice\nof raising rates pre-emptively, before undesirable inflation pressures actually emerge.\nTo summarize the economic outlook, then, I expect growth to continue at about the modest pace\nwe’ve seen over the first five years of this expansion. While the acceleration that many have\nbeen forecasting for right around the corner would be welcome, that scenario seems less likely\nthan a scenario in which growth continues to be held back by household cautiousness, low\nproductivity growth and restrained housing markets. Inflation, meanwhile, remains wellbehaved, but maintaining that good performance will require withdrawing monetary stimulus at\nan appropriate time to prevent the emergence of inflationary pressures.\n\n* At the time this speech was delivered, the Charlotte Bobcats basketball team had recently been\nrenamed the Hornets.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roy Webb for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nOn the creation of the Fed, see Elmus Wicker, “The Great Debate on Banking Reform: Nelson Aldrich and the\nOrigins of the Fed,” Columbus, OH: Ohio State University Press, 2005; and Eugene White, “The Regulation and\nReform of the American Banking System, 1900-1929,” Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983.\n3\nFor more on the Fed’s history, see Jeffrey M.

            "content": "Investing in People as an Economic Growth Strategy\nJune 26, 2014\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nLynchburg College, School of Economics and Business\nLynchburg, Va.\n\nGood morning. It’s a pleasure to be here in Lynchburg and to learn about your many technology\nand education initiatives. It’s especially rewarding to visit a community that places such value on\nearly childhood education and recognizes how those early years help lay the foundation for a\nskilled workforce in the future. The importance of early intervention and its connection to\nworkforce development has been a major focus of study for us at the Richmond Fed, and it will\nbe the subject of my talk this morning. Before I begin, I must note that my opinions are my own\nand may not be shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nNow, it might not be obvious why the president of a Federal Reserve Bank would be interested\nin workforce development — what does it have to do with interest rates and inflation? But\nworkforce development is intimately related to the second part of the Fed’s legislative mandate,\nwhich is promoting maximum employment. That has proven to be a difficult task in the wake of\n2007-09 recession, as I’m sure you are all too aware. The unemployment rate persisted around 9\npercent for more than two years after the end of the recession, although it has declined\nsignificantly over the past few years. According to the most recent data, the unemployment rate\nhas fallen to 5.6 percent here in Lynchburg, compared to 5.1 percent for the Commonwealth of\nVirginia. Although both are well below the national average of 6.3 percent, they are above rates\nthat were typical before the last recession.\nThere are some indicators that would seem to suggest that the labor market has recovered less\nthan the decline in the national unemployment rate would indicate: The long-term unemployment\nrate remains at a historic high, and the labor force participation rate is at its lowest rate in\ndecades. So in addition to the large number of unemployed, there are also many people who have\ndropped out of the labor force altogether. That has led me and other policymakers to ponder a\ndifficult question: Given the limitations of monetary policy, what can be done to improve labor\nmarket outcomes in the long run?\nAt the Richmond Fed, our research suggests that much of what we’re currently seeing in the\nlabor market reflects structural trends rather than a primarily cyclical change in labor market\nbehavior. That has prompted us to think about long-term strategies to prepare workers for the\nlabor market. We’ve been thinking about workforce development at the level of the individual:\nWhat can be done to improve people’s skills and adaptability, what economists call “human”\ncapital? This approach suggests that we may realize high returns from workforce development\nefforts, particularly those that encourage individual investments in skills starting at a young age.\nWorkforce development should be thought of as more than just a short-term treatment ― it also\n\n1\n\n\fcan work as a long-term vaccine that makes workers more resilient to changing labor market\nconditions.\nTrend versus Cycle\nWhen unemployment is high and inflation is low, the traditional argument is that a central bank\nshould employ expansionary monetary policy to try to lower the unemployment rate. But\nunemployment is complicated: People become unemployed at different times for different\nreasons, and those reasons influence the likely effectiveness of monetary policy. The term\n“cyclical unemployment” is often used to refer to unemployment associated with a temporary\ndownturn in the economy and is thought to respond to monetary stimulus. The term “structural\nunemployment” is used to refer to unemployment caused by long-term changes in the economy,\nsuch as the decline of certain industries or changing technology, and is thought to be less likely\nto be affected by monetary policy. 2 Unfortunately for policymakers, the distinction between\ncyclical and structural unemployment is not always clear — and sometimes, a cyclical downturn\ncan be caused by structural shifts. For example, the decline in manufacturing employment was an\nimportant factor in the economic downturn in 2001. While the labor market eventually\nrecovered, there was a long period of adjustment as new jobs were created in nonmanufacturing\nsectors — a process that reflected more than just a shortfall in demand.\nAt least some portion of the high unemployment following the Great Recession appears to have\nbeen caused by structural factors. For example, we heard from a number of employers\nthroughout the Fifth District that they were unable to find workers with the necessary skills,\ndespite the large pool of unemployed workers. And recent research by a Richmond Fed\neconomist on the unusually large rise in long-term unemployment suggests that it was caused by\nan increase in the number of unemployed workers who were inherently less likely to exit\nunemployment, perhaps because they lost a job in a declining industry and their skills were not\neasily transferable. 3\nThe labor market seems to have improved recently; over the past two years, the unemployment\nrate has declined 2 full percentage points. Underlying this decline, however, is an unusual trend:\na large drop in the labor force. The labor force participation rate is defined as the portion of the\nworking-age population that is either employed or unemployed and looking for work. Workers\nare only counted as unemployed if they are actively seeking a job, so the unemployment rate can\ndecline not only if people find jobs, but also if a large number of people decide to quit looking\nand thus exit the labor force. An alternative measure of unemployment includes “marginally\nattached” workers — those who say they want a job but who have not looked for work during the\npast four weeks. This measure is more than a full percentage point higher than the standard\nunemployment rate, which suggests that the standard rate might be understating the actual\namount of “slack” in the labor market and overstating the recovery.\nAs with the unemployment rate, however, it’s important to try to untangle the influence of\ncyclical factors, such as discouragement over job prospects, versus structural factors, such as the\nretirement of many baby boomers or the increased number of young people attending college\nrather than entering the labor market. 4 In fact, the labor force participation rate has been\n\n2\n\n\fdeclining for more than a decade, and economists at the Richmond Fed have concluded that the\ncurrent low rate is consistent with this long-run trend. 5\nTaking a broader view of the labor market, our economists also have constructed an alternative\nmeasure of labor market slack, which they call the “non-employment index.” This measure\nconsiders all of the working-age population that is currently not working as potentially\nemployable, not just those counted as unemployed under the official definition. But it also\nrecognizes that they are not all equally likely to find a job, so it weights different groups by their\nlikelihood of finding a job. The changes in this alternative rate parallel those of the standard\nunemployment rate, and both are about halfway back to their pre-2007 troughs. This suggests\nthat the standard unemployment rate actually is a reasonably accurate reflection of the current\namount of slack in the labor market. 6 In other words, there is more slack than indicated by the\nstandard unemployment rate, but there always is, and there seems to be no more additional slack\nnow than is typically associated with the current level of the unemployment rate.\nSo my reading of the evidence is that much of what we have observed over the past five years\nreflects structural changes in the economy that would have been difficult for monetary policy to\noffset. This is a good reason to think about what strategies we can employ to ensure that future\ngenerations of workers are prepared to respond to such changes.\nHuman Capital Theory and Workforce Development\nTo think about those strategies, it’s helpful to begin in the early 1960s, when economists began\nseriously studying the forces and decisions that lead people to differ in their capabilities. They\nproposed thinking about knowledge and skills as simply another form of capital that makes\nworkers productive, just like physical capital such as machines or computers. Workers acquire\nthis “human” capital by making investments, such as by attending school, getting on-the-job\ntraining or even receiving medical care. 7\nMore recently, a consensus has developed that human capital is more than just the number of\nyears spent in school or on the job. Research suggests that noncognitive skills — such as\nfollowing instructions, patience and work ethic — lay the foundation for mastering more\ncomplex cognitive skills and may be just as important a determinant of future labor market\nsuccess. 8 These basic emotional and social skills are learned very early in life, and it can be\ndifficult for children who fall behind to catch up: Gaps in skills that are important for adult\noutcomes are observable by age 5 and tend to persist into adulthood.9\nWhat does the economics of human capital imply for workforce development programs? Several\ninsights are especially relevant. First, it makes economic sense to concentrate intensive human\ncapital investment in the form of formal schooling on the young: The earlier workers invest, the\nlonger they have to profit from their investments. In addition, because earnings typically increase\nwith age, young people attending school tend to sacrifice less by way of forgone earnings than\nolder workers. Another key takeaway is that investments in early childhood can affect later\ndecisions about formal schooling. If the foundations for learning are laid very early, then even\nmild delays in acquiring noncognitive skills might make skill acquisition more challenging later\n\n3\n\n\fin life; after all, why try as hard to get good grades, stay in high school or enroll in college when\nthose efforts might not pay off?\nHuman capital economics also implies that higher education should lead to higher future wages,\nboth because education is costly to acquire and because it can elevate a person’s productivity.\nIndeed, the data confirm that the payoff to education is quite high, a point to which I will return\nin a moment. 10\nJust as this view of workforce development points toward investment early in life, it also points\ntoward the challenges confronting later interventions. Asking adults to reinvent themselves in the\nface of a relatively short remaining working horizon, when early retirement and exiting the labor\nforce become viable options, is asking a lot of both the workers and the workforce development\nprofessionals who train them. And indeed, research suggests that workforce development efforts\nthat focus solely on training or retraining adult workers might have only modest effects on\nemployment and job retention. 11\nOf course, this does not mean that adults cannot or should not learn new skills; I am deeply\nsympathetic to the plight of workers who have been laid off from jobs they performed admirably\nfor decades, and I commend those who wish to complete or further their education. But we may\nneed to be cautious about treating older workers’ difficulties as remediable through training,\nwhen the appropriate course of action may actually involve greater use of the social safety net.\nWe may be able to help a large number of future workers, however, by expanding our focus and\nthinking about workforce development not as a cure for the short-term shocks that individuals\nmay experience, but rather as a long-term vaccine that will protect them against future shocks.\nMore specifically, interventions well before adulthood, even as early as preschool, can\nreasonably be considered as part of a long-term workforce development program. For example,\nwe hear from both employers and workforce development professionals in our District that a lack\nof soft skills is a major obstacle for many job applicants. An early focus on critical noncognitive\nskills thus may help improve labor market outcomes later in life.\nThe Role of Information in Human Capital Investment\nWhen we look at the data, we find support for the view that labor market outcomes vary\nsignificantly with human capital investments made early in life, most notably formal education.\nFollowing the 2007-09 recession, the unemployment rate for workers with only a high school\ndiploma peaked at 11 percent, compared to just 5 percent for workers with a college degree.\nEven now, the unemployment rate for high school-educated workers is about twice the rate for\ncollege educated workers, 6.5 percent versus 3.2 percent.\nEducation also has a significant effect on earnings. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nthe median weekly wage for a worker with a bachelor’s degree or higher in 2013 was $1,194,\ncompared with $651 for a worker with only a high school diploma. Over a lifetime, the median\nworker with a bachelor’s degree can expect to earn $2.3 million, based on 2009 earnings data,\ncompared with just $1.3 million earned by the median worker with a high school diploma. 12\n\n4\n\n\fThese facts make it tempting to recommend college as the primary path for workforce\ndevelopment. But let me note an important caveat: Higher wages and lower unemployment rates\nare benefits that appear to accrue only to students who actually graduate from college; there is\nrelatively little benefit to attending college for only a few semesters without earning a degree.\nFor example, workers who have attended some college but have not graduated are unemployed\nat roughly the same rate as workers with only a high school degree. And while they do earn\nabout 15 percent more than high school-educated workers, workers with at least a bachelor’s\ndegree earn 83 percent more. Despite the high return to college completion, however, the college\ndropout rate is around 40 percent, and the high school dropout rate is also relatively high. 13 More\nthan 20 percent of high school students fail to graduate within four years; the rate is as high as 40\npercent in some large urban school districts. About 7 percent of 16-24 year olds have not earned\na high school diploma or a certificate of high school equivalency. These students earn\nsignificantly lower wages and face much higher unemployment rates than workers with more\neducation.\nWhat do these statistics tell us? Students who plan to attend college could benefit from more\ninformation about what is required to succeed. We’ve spoken with representatives from fouryear colleges and community colleges in the Hampton Roads area who have noted that many\nstudents are surprised to discover they lack the basic math skills necessary for college-level\nwork. If students do not have an accurate assessment of their own readiness for college, they may\nbe more likely to drop out after they get there. That’s a costly lesson to learn; the average debt\nburden among college dropouts who took out loans is more than $14,000. 14 These students could\nbenefit from learning about options other than enrolling directly in four-year colleges.\nCommunity colleges, for example, are a venue where students can learn more about their\ninterests and aptitudes and hone the skills that are required for success at four-year schools.\nThere may also be large gains from sharing information with high school students about different\ncareer and postsecondary education options and about the level of preparedness necessary for\nsuccess. For example, one factor in the high school dropout rate may be the increasing focus of\nmost high schools on college preparation, to the exclusion of other options. But some students\nmay not wish to attend college or may perceive large barriers to doing so. If these students\nbelieve that the only reason to complete high school is to attend college, they might not see much\nvalue in graduating. But learning about alternative career and educational opportunities that also\nrequire a high school degree could increase the perceived value of high school completion. 15 For\nexample, a growing number of vocational or apprenticeship programs offer specialized training\nin areas that are in high demand, such as health care and advanced manufacturing.\nResearch suggests that many students are also unaware of the fact that there is a difference\nbetween the average return to college and the return that is likely to accrue to any individual\nstudent. 16 Not all college majors are created equal: The median salary for workers who majored\nin engineering is $75,000, compared with $42,000 for workers who majored in psychology or\nsocial work. And students may vary in other ways that affect their labor market chances\nirrespective of major. Workforce development thus could include providing students with better\ninformation to help them weigh their relative risks and rewards of college attendance.\n\n5\n\n\fWe must also try to ensure that well-prepared students don’t forgo college because of perceived\nobstacles such as cost or lack of knowledge about the payoff. Many students, particularly lowincome students, overestimate the costs of college and underestimate their opportunities for\nfinancial aid. Students also might face social norms that cause them to underestimate their\npotential benefits or their likelihoods of success. Researchers have found that providing these\nstudents with targeted information and assistance can increase their matriculation rates, and it\ncan play an important role in changing the beliefs of students who erroneously think they’re not\ncollege material. 17\nThe takeaway from this discussion is that examining workforce development through the lens of\nhuman capital economics suggests that workers will realize higher returns on their investments in\nhuman capital when those investments are made early in life. That could mean expanding the\nscope of workforce development strategies to include early childhood education and providing\nyoung people with information about the risks and returns of multiple career and educational\noptions.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, it is difficult for monetary policymakers to distinguish between cyclical and\nstructural shifts in the labor market. But the distinction is critical, because monetary stimulus is\nunlikely to have much effect on unemployment that results from the latter. My own view is that\nmuch of what we have experienced since the Great Recession is the result of structural shocks\nand longer-term changes in the economy, which has led me and my colleagues at the Richmond\nFed to think about how we can best prepare workers to respond to future changes. One answer\nseems to be thinking about workforce development as a long-term investment, not a short-term\nfix.\nWorkforce development is an issue of vital importance for individual workers, for employers and\nfor communities. It’s also critical for our country as a whole. The tremendous gains in living\nstandards achieved over the past three centuries depended crucially on investments in physical\ncapital. But human capital was critical as well: The accumulation of knowledge over time is\nessential to the process of uncovering and deploying technological innovations that fuel\neconomic growth. And when we look at disparities in economic outcomes across our society, it\nis clear that differences in human capital accumulation play a large role. Doing our utmost to\nhelp the next generation of workers make the best use of their talents and opportunities will lay\nthe groundwork for both them and their children to achieve their full potential and for the United\nStates to achieve a more inclusive prosperity.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero, Kartik Athreya, Urvi Neelakantan, and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing\nthese remarks.\n2\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond, “Labor Market Conditions and Policy,” Our Perspective essay, updated June\n9, 2014.\n3\nAndreas Hornstein, \"Accounting for Unemployment: The Long and Short of It,\" Federal Reserve Bank of\nRichmond Working Paper 12-07, November 2012.\n4\nJessie Romero, \"Where Have All the Workers Gone?\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Econ Focus,\nSecond/Third Quarter 2012, pp. 12-16.\n\n6\n\n\f5\n\nMarianna Kudlyak, \"A Cohort Model of Labor Force Participation,\" Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic\nQuarterly, First Quarter 2013, vol. 99, no. 1, pp. 25-43.\n6 Andreas Hornstein, Marianna Kudlyak, Fabian Lange, and Tim Sablik. “Does the Unemployment Rate Really\nOverstate Labor Market Recovery?” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Brief no. 14-06, June 2014.\n7\nFor foundational papers, see the Journal of Political Economy, October 1962, vol. 70, no. 5, Part 2: Investment in\nHuman Beings.\n8\nFor example, the general educational development (GED) credential is supposed to be equivalent to a high school\ndiploma, but people who have earned a GED tend to have much worse labor market outcomes than people who have\ngraduated from high school.

            "content": "The Fed as Lender of Last Resort:\nComments on “Rules for a Lender of Last Resort” by Michael Bordo\nMay 30, 2014\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nFrameworks for Central Banking in the Next Century\nHoover Institution, Stanford University\nStanford, Calif.\n\nA conference devoted to central banking in the coming century would be woefully inadequate\nwithout a session devoted to central bank lending. Credit extension arguably has been the most\nproblematic and contentious aspect of central banking, and it seems likely to remain so for the\nforeseeable future. Michael Bordo has provided us with a learned and useful review of the idea\nof the “Lender of Last Resort” (LOLR), both in history and as it relates to recent practice here in\nthe United States. I say useful because even among prominent economists and policymakers,\nthere is a good deal of confusion about the historical meaning of the phrase, not to mention what\nit implies about current practice. So it’s helpful to clear away the underbrush of misconstrued\ntraditions. 1\nThere are two distinctions that strike me as critical for thinking about central bank lending\npolicy. The first is between monetary policy and credit policy, which Marvin Goodfriend\ndiscussed yesterday. 2 Central bank actions constitute monetary policy if they alter the quantity of\nits monetary liabilities, often referred to as high-powered money. Central bank actions constitute\ncredit policy if they alter the composition of its portfolio — by lending, for example — but do\nnot affect the outstanding amount of monetary liabilities. An open market purchase, in which the\nFed buys government securities by crediting a bank’s reserve account at the Fed, is monetary\npolicy. It’s true that Fed lending also results in an addition to a bank’s reserve account. But under\nthe Fed’s pre-crisis interest rate targeting regime, the added reserves would be automatically\ndrained through offsetting open market operations to avoid driving the funds rate below target. In\nthis case, the lending is effectively “sterilized” and the Fed can be thought of as selling Treasury\nsecurities and lending the proceeds to the borrower. This is clearly fiscal policy, and it qualifies\nas credit allocation in the sense that the borrower obtains funds on terms that are presumably\npreferred to the terms available in the market. Sterilized central bank lending is credit policy;\nunsterilized lending is a combination of monetary policy and credit policy.\nThis distinction is essential to understanding the historical origins of the LOLR idea. Michael\nBordo defines a lender of last resort — correctly, in my view — as a central bank willing to\nsupply high-powered money to satisfy increased demand in a panic. Walter Bagehot, and before\nhim Henry Thornton, advocated unsterilized lending to accomplish this, though neither man used\nthe phrase “lender of last resort” in print. But note that the supply of high-powered money can in\nprinciple be increased equally well through open market purchases of government securities.\n\n1\n\n\fWhat was essential during a 19th century panic was expanding the supply of paper notes; how\nthat expansion was accomplished was less important. 3\nThe phrase “Lender of Last Resort,” along with Walter Bagehot’s name, were often invoked, like\nHoly Writ, during crisis policy discussions in 2007 and 2008. But with the distinction between\nmonetary and credit policy in mind, it’s clear that the Fed’s lending, which was sterilized prior to\nvery late in 2008, had very little to do with what Thornton and Bagehot had in mind. 4 Under the\nFed’s federal funds rate targeting regime, the supply of bank reserves expanded automatically\nthrough open market operations when demand increased, as occurred in August of 2007. No\nlending programs were required.\nThe distinction between monetary and credit policy also illuminates the Fed’s policy actions\nduring the Great Depression, another frequently cited chapter of Holy Writ. The Fed’s failure to\nprevent waves of bank failures in the early 1930s often has been cited as evidence that 2008\ncrisis lending was essential to preventing a “Great Depression 2.0.” The critical development\nduring the Depression, however, was the decline of nearly 30 percent in the money stock from\n1930 to 1933; as a result, the average price level collapsed by the same amount. 5 Certainly, bank\nfailures contributed to the decline in the money stock. But as Milton Friedman and Anna\nSchwartz noted, had the bank failures occurred without a drastic decline in the stock of money,\n“they would have been notable but not crucial,” while a collapse of the money stock without the\nbank failures would have produced a contraction “at least equally severe.” 6 So yes, the Fed failed\nin its LOLR responsibilities, as Bordo notes, but the Great Contraction was a failure of monetary\npolicy, not credit policy.\nWe should also recall the distinction between monetary and credit policy when thinking about\nthe Fed’s founding 100 years ago. Some have justified the Fed’s credit market interventions in\nthe recent crisis by noting that the Fed was founded to respond to banking panics. It is certainly\ntrue that the banking panics of the late 19th century motivated the creation of the Federal\nReserve. But the central issue at that time was legislative restrictions that limited the extent to\nwhich the supply of currency could expand elastically to satisfy the demand for withdrawals.\nThese defects gave rise to a broad banking reform movement focused on what was called “The\nCurrency Problem.” The primary goal in establishing the Federal Reserve was “to furnish an\nelastic currency” that would expand and contract appropriately with the needs of the economy. 7\nReform advocates debated how the new note issues would be backed. In their thinking, currency\nbacked by government bonds was associated with episodes of inflationary wartime finance.\nMoreover, the bond collateral requirement under the National Bank Act had helped make note\nissue cumbersome and inelastic. The short-term commercial paper that the Act envisioned as the\nmain collateral for advances to banks represented the least risky non-government asset class\navailable. 8 Another motive for commercial paper as backing for Fed lending was to support\nshifting international trade finance business from Europe to the United States, a somewhat\nparochial interest championed by the New York banker Paul Warburg. 9 I know of no evidence\nthat taking on counterparty credit risk, as in sterilized lending, was an important objective for the\nfounders. In fact, they rejected proposals to include a deposit insurance scheme in the Federal\nReserve Act because experience with state schemes had been plagued by moral hazard and\nexcessive losses. 10\n2\n\n\fThere is a second important distinction that I believe is critical for thinking about central bank\nlending. An ex-post perspective on these issues takes an instance of financial distress as given\nand considers possible central bank responses. In contrast, an ex-ante perspective focuses on how\nfinancial market participants, taking expected central bank behavior as given, will structure their\naffairs. 11 This distinction, of course, is fundamental to the theme of this conference, since it\nhighlights time consistency problems and the value of commitment to rule-like behavior.\nTension between these two perspectives was evident in policy discussions during the most recent\ncrisis. Policymakers heard a lot of scary words about what had happened to market conditions ―\nwords such as “disruption,” “distress,” and “dysfunction,” to name just a few. These words have\nno clear economic meaning, but they encouraged a focus on potential interventions that might\nhave immediate palliative effects. 12 An ex-ante perspective, however, suggested that\npolicymakers should be focused on the question of whether a proposed intervention was\nconsistent with a pattern of response that we would have wanted market participants to believe\nthe Fed would pursue, or whether intervention would instead alter expectations in a way that\nwould have adverse effects on incentives going forward.\nThis isn’t fundamentalism; it’s simply a recognition that central bank actions affect beliefs about\nfuture central bank actions, which in turn affect market participants’ incentives to protect\nthemselves against financial distress, rather than rely on central bank support. In other words, it’s\na recognition of the value of commitment. If we learned anything about central banking from the\nVolcker disinflation, it’s that actions that are costly in the short run are sometimes necessary to\nachieve the implicit commitment required for monetary stability. 13 This lesson has yet to be fully\nlearned in the realm of central bank credit policy. Until it is, financial stability is likely to be\nelusive.\nOne argument for central bank credit market activism rests on the notion that fragility is inherent\nin modern financial markets, and that central bank lending is an essential component of an\nefficiently functioning financial system. But as Michael Bordo points out, we entered 2007 with\na history, going back to 1970, of numerous cases of intervention or forbearance by the Fed and\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that effectively rescued uninsured creditors of\nvarious distressed entities. Four decades of precedent surely encouraged the belief that acute\nfinancial distress is likely to elicit some sort of rescue. Although this question is not yet settled,\nmy view is that pre-crisis financial vulnerabilities were in large measure induced by financial\nmarkets’ response to a long record of discretionary Federal Reserve interventions in credit\nmarkets. 14\nOne can appreciate how this interventionist tendency arose, though. When one is confronted with\nan instance of financial distress, an ex-post mindset makes it tempting to leave moral hazard\nproblems for another day, to be dealt with after the crisis through tougher regulatory constraints\non risk-taking. But tougher regulations just boost the incentive to move risk-taking outside of\nregulated sectors ― into the shadows, as it were. And creditor expectations of support often\ncompel intervention, since disappointing those expectations by withholding support can provoke\na turbulent realignment of expectations about support for other similarly situated entities. A\n\n3\n\n\fstrategy of discretionary credit market intervention, focused on alleviating ex-post distress, gives\nrise to a repeated cycle of crisis, rescue, regulation and bypass.\nMichael Bordo rightly deplores “constructive ambiguity,” the communications strategy of\nsuggesting that official support might not be made available, while preserving the option to\nintervene. Actions speak louder than words, though, and the implied financial safety net has\ngrown over time. Richmond Fed economists estimated, on the basis of official statements and\nprecedents, that at least 45 percent of financial sector liabilities were viewed as implicitly\ngovernment guaranteed at the end of 1999. 15 By the end of 2011 that figure had risen to over 57\npercent. More than half of that represents guarantees implied by precedents, rather than\nlegislative guarantees such as deposit insurance. 16\nGiven the rescue expectations that have built up over the last several decades, I believe it will\ntake more than a sincere pledge to limit central bank lending to solve the time consistency\nproblem. The resolution planning provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act — often called “living\nwills” — require the creation of credible plans for resolving large institutions in bankruptcy\nwithout government funding. 17 Work is underway implementing these provisions, but much\nmore is needed. It’s worth emphasizing, however, that such plans should not take the current\ncomplexity and scale of large institutions as immutably given. The strategy should be to work\nbackward from resolvability, without government funding backstops, to deduce how their current\noperations and funding need to be structured. Significant changes may be required, but resolution\nplanning appears to be the only plausible way to dismantle “too big to fail.”\nThe existence of plausible resolution plans for the range of financial entities formerly viewed as\ncandidates for government bailouts would make a commitment to limit government rescues\nmuch more persuasive. In addition, if the Fed and the FDIC accept resolution plans as credible\n(that is, they do not declare them “not credible”), they would be implying that they would\nsupport invoking the plans in a crisis. Presumably, this would raise an additional hurdle to a\ngovernment-funded creditor rescue in the event of distress.\nI’ll close with a reminder that establishing credible limits to central bank intervention in credit\nmarkets is critical to central banks’ core monetary policy mission. Entanglement in the\ndistributional politics of credit allocation inevitably threatens the delicate equilibrium underlying\ncentral bank independence, which has been so essential to monetary stability. The fallout from\nthe 2008 crisis vividly illustrates the risks to that equilibrium. The breakdown of that equilibrium\nin the 1970s provides vivid lessons in the dangers of credit allocation. Not only did Fed\npolicymakers need to resist political pressure to lower unemployment, they also had their hands\nfull resisting pressure to buy federal agency debt. The disastrous results for inflation are well\nknown. Less well known is that by 1977, the Fed owned $117 million in debt issued by\nWashington, D.C.’s transit authority — with the bizarre result that the Fed wound up financing\nthe construction of the Washington Metro. 18\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing these remarks.

            "content": "Welcome and Introductory Remarks, 2014 Credit Markets Symposium\nMay 13, 2014\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharlotte Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nGood morning. I’m Jeff Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. It is my\npleasure to welcome you to our eighth annual Credit Markets Symposium. We are once again\ndelighted to bring together market practitioners, financial industry policymakers and academics\nfor an open and honest dialogue about current issues in credit markets.\nSince 2007, the year of the first Credit Markets Symposium, we’ve had a number of fruitful\ndiscussions in this forum. Many of them have been focused on the process by which credit\nmarkets have been recovering from the financial crisis. At this point, conditions have certainly\nimproved, but many challenges remain — not the least of which is navigating a landscape that\nhas undergone a number of significant regulatory changes, with more to come.\nThose changes will be our focus over the next day and a half. In particular, we have organized\ndiscussions on:\no the implementation and impact of the Volcker Rule;\no trends and expectations for leveraged lending;\no how firms have been affected by the transition to a central counterparty;\no and the ever-popular question of the fate of the housing finance GSEs, as well as the\nbroader question of the government’s proper role in housing finance.\nThese sessions will be led by a diverse group of panelists with strong representation from both\nindustry and the regulatory community. In each session, our goal is not merely to review the\ndetails of a specific regulation but also to have an engaging discussion about the implications for\nyour work and for the credit markets more broadly. To that end, we have allocated time during\neach session for Q&A, and we encourage you to use that time to ask questions and share your\nperspective.\nWe’re also honored to have with us keynote speakers Edward DeMarco and Phillip Swagel. Mr.\nDeMarco is the former acting director at the Federal Housing Finance Agency. We’re looking\nforward to hearing his perspective on housing policy and the residential mortgage market. Mr.\nSwagel is a professor of international economic policy at the University of Maryland’s School of\nPublic Policy and was the assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department\nfrom 2006 through 2009. He will share with us his insights on financial regulatory reform since\nthe crisis.\n\n\fBefore I hand things over to Matt Martin, the regional branch executive here in Charlotte, I\nwould like to note that it is especially appropriate to be having these discussions in 2014, the\nFed’s centennial year. As you are probably aware, the Federal Reserve Act was signed in\nDecember 1913, and the regional Reserve Banks opened for business in November 1914. The\ncommemoration of the our centennial is an opportunity to reflect on how the financial system has\nevolved — sometimes for the better, and at times, to be frank, for the worse — and how\nregulators and market participants have coped along the way.\nAt the time the Fed was founded, banking laws sharply restricted branching, and as a result there\nwere 27,285 banks when the Fed was founded. 1 Banking laws also made it cumbersome to issue\nbank notes, our main form of hand-to-hand currency. The result was a fragmented banking\nsystem with critical structural weaknesses. Moving crops to market strained the monetary system\nevery autumn, driving up interest rates and drawing in gold from abroad. And banks would\nsuspend withdrawals during periodic panics, disrupting people’s ability to make payments. These\nissues gave rise to a broad banking reform movement focused on “The Currency Problem.” The\nprimary goal in establishing the Federal Reserve thus was “to furnish an elastic currency” that\nwould expand and contract appropriately with the needs of the economy. 2\nThe world looks very different today, of course. The gold standard is a thing of the past, and an\nelastic supply of payment instruments ― both paper and digital ― is taken for granted.\nBranching restrictions have largely disappeared. Surely the Fed’s founders would be amazed by\nthe fact that they can withdraw money from the same bank whether they’re in California or\nNorth Carolina (not to mention being amazed by the machine that allows them to do so). And I\ndoubt that the founders envisioned the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, much less synthetic\ncollateralized debt obligations.\nAlongside the dramatic changes we’ve seen in banking and credit markets since the founding of\nthe Fed, we’ve also seen a significant evolution in the role and operations of the Fed itself. In the\nbeginning, lending to banks through the discount window was our method of supplying currency\nto meet swings in demand. Over time, however, we shifted to relying on open market purchases\nof U.S. Treasury securities to carry out monetary operations. Under this approach, Fed lending\noperations are divorced from monetary policy and have become pure fiscal policy actions, in\nwhich Treasury securities are sold to the public to raise funds for the Fed’s borrowers. It seems\nlikely that the Fed’s founders would have been amazed by the uses made of Fed lending in the\nrecent crisis.\nThere are some who praise the Fed’s credit market interventions and advocate an expansive role\nfor the Fed in promoting financial stability and mitigating financial system disruptions. They\nconstrue the founders of the Federal Reserve System as motivated by a broad desire to minimize\nand prevent financial panics, even beyond simply satisfying increased demand for currency. My\nown view, which I must note may not be shared by all my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem, favors a narrower and more restrained role, focused on the critical core function of\nmanaging the monetary liabilities of the central bank. Ambitious use of a central bank’s balance\nsheet to channel credit to particular economic sectors or entities threatens to entangle the central\nbank in distributional politics and place the bank’s independence at risk. Moreover, the use of\n\n\fcentral bank credit to rescue creditors boosts moral hazard and encourages vulnerability to\nfinancial shocks.\nBut I recognize that there is a range of views on this topic both outside of and within the Federal\nReserve System and, I am sure, within this room. That’s why events like this are so important, to\nbring people together to share their ideas and opinions about the many important issues related to\nour credit markets today.\n***\nIn addition to the disclaimer I just offered for myself, I will go ahead and offer a blanket\ndisclaimer for the Federal Reserve officials moderating panels today and tomorrow: The views\nand opinions they express here are their own and do not necessarily reflect the official opinions\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, the Federal Reserve System, or any other regulatory\nagency or individual. While we will be covering a variety of topics over the next two days, to the\nextent that we discuss topics for which the Board of Governors is writing rules but the comment\nperiod has closed, participants from the Federal Reserve may be limited in what they can say.\nFinally, I would like to thank our hosts here in Charlotte for putting together an excellent event.\nOur Charlotte branch first opened in 1927, at the urging of local bankers, but Charlotte was\nactually one of the cities that competed vigorously with Richmond to be one of the original\nFederal Reserve cities. I’m sure, however, that the wonderful hospitality you will receive over\nthe next day and a half will put to rest any concerns that there is still lingering resentment over\nlosing out to the River City.\n\n1\n\nU.S. Bureau of the Census, “Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970, Part 2,”\nWashington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1975.\n2 See Jeffrey M.

Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCenter for Advanced Study in Economic Efficiency\nArizona State University, Tempe, Arizona\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak to you today. It’s been a long time since I was an active\nparticipant in the world of economic research. These days, as I play a role in policy deliberations,\nI am a consumer of research findings, not a producer. In that role I was privileged to witness, and\nat times take part in, some of the policy discussions that shaped the Fed’s management of the\nfinancial crisis of 2007–08. Although it has been more than five years since then, the\nrecollections of that unhappy time should still be relatively fresh in our minds. If they are not, the\nannual release of the transcripts of the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, with a\nfive-year lag, can help jog our memories. In fact, the 2008 transcripts were released this\nmorning. Within those 1,500 verbatim pages, you will see me and several other consumers of\neconomic research grappling with some very difficult policy decisions. In my remarks today I\nwould like to share some observations inspired by my experience attempting to use economic\nmodels in decision making during the crisis. Before I begin, I must note that my opinions are my\nown and may not be shared by all my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nThe period from the summer of 2007 through the winter of 2009 was a scary time, marked by\nsignificant volatility in financial markets and anxiety about asset values and counterparty risk.\nPolicymakers heard a lot of scary words used to describe market conditions, words such as\n“disruption,” “distress,” “fragile,” “firesale,” and “stressful.” People talked about markets seizing\nand investors running; about logjams and credit crunches; about deterioration and dysfunction. 2\nThese words have frightening connotations, but, by themselves, they lack specific economic\nmeaning and thus do not provide an obvious guide for policy.\nThere are, however, economic models based on specific financial frictions, such as adverse\nselection and limited participation, that appear to generate similarly scary phenomena. Such\nmodels were at times invoked as justification for some of the array of programs that expanded\nFed lending and allocated credit to specific sectors of the economy. In this respect, economic\ntheory mattered a great deal. But I think it’s fair to say there was far less discussion of specific\nmodels of banking and financial markets than there could have been. I found it disappointing that\nthere did not appear to be much interest in probing the applicability of different models to the\nquestion at hand or in critically examining models’ assumptions about frictions to see if they\nwere a good match for what we actually observed. Moreover, in my view, there was not enough\ndiscussion about the long-term consequences of our response in a given circumstance and\nwhether it would be consistent with a pattern of response that, if permanently adopted, would be\nex-ante efficiency enhancing.\n\n1\n\n\fI am going to organize my remarks around selected moments during the financial crisis at which\nparticularly critical decisions were made to intervene in credit markets. I will share some of the\nrationales used to justify them, as well as some alternative explanations for market conditions at\nthe time. Along the way, I will share some of the reasons for my opposition to the Fed’s credit\nmarket interventions, and why I remain deeply skeptical about the advisability of those actions. I\ndo so mindful of the possibility that future research could alter our understanding of the events\nand policy prescriptions of 2007–08. Indeed, it was 30 years after the Great Contraction of 1929–\n33 that Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz gave us the first compelling understanding of those\nevents, 3 and in the last two decades researchers have significantly improved our understanding of\nthe Great Depression. But even at this early date, the evidence strikes me as fairly persuasive that\nthe Fed missed an opportunity to respond far more constructively than it did. Finally, I’ll share\nsome suggestions regarding research directions that would be useful to policymakers in future\ncrises.\nDiscount Window Lending\nLet’s start with the summer of 2007. The dramatic events of the fall of 2008 have garnered the\nlion’s share of the attention devoted to the financial crisis, but I would argue that the policy\ndirection was set earlier, which significantly influenced the subsequent evolution of events. On\nthe evening of August 16, 2007, the FOMC held a video conference call. To simplify\nconsiderably the conditions we discussed, the financial-market volatility of the previous weeks\nseemed to be escalating. 4 Particular attention focused on the market for asset-backed commercial\npaper ― short-term instruments backed by designated pools of other financial assets. As staff\nexplained to the committee, investors were withdrawing from the ABCP market. The spreads on\nABCP were rising and the amounts being issued were smaller and of shorter maturity. Some\nlarge banks had sponsored ABCP financing vehicles and market conditions were affecting their\nneed for funding. At the conclusion of the call, the Committee decided to lower the interest rate\ncharged on discount window loans to banks. In recent years this rate had been kept at 1\npercentage point above the Committee’s target for the federal funds rate; the Committee lowered\nthe spread to 50 basis points. This move was intended to improve the cost and availability of\ncredit to banks. 5\nWhat was the justification for this policy action? For some meeting participants and staff, the\naforementioned scary words seemed to suffice. Others viewed the action as directly in line with\nthe central bank’s historical role as the “lender of last resort.” As one person noted while\nexplaining the proposed change, “We have given considerable thought here to what we might do\nwith the lender-of-last-resort facility to try to help break up some of the logjams in the market,\nwhere people simply aren’t making markets…We felt that one issue was a funding uncertainty in\nthe banks.” 6 [Emphasis added.]\nThe presumption was that the markets were suffering from a problem for which increased Fed\ncredit was the solution. But this presumption was open to question. In the late summer of 2007,\nwe were hearing that there were plenty of funds on the sidelines and plenty of actors who could\nhave purchased asset-backed paper if they thought the price made it a worthwhile opportunity.\nMoreover, banks also had access to significant funding through the Federal Home Loan Banks,\nentities that could borrow in capital markets at advantageous rates because they were viewed as\n2\n\n\f“too big to fail” and pass those rates on to member banks. Indeed, borrowing from the FHLBs\nexpanded by about $180 billion in the third quarter of 2007. The lack of interest in borrowing\nfrom the Federal Reserve Banks probably reflected the fact that we were simply out priced.\nMore broadly, expanded Federal Reserve lending would not have increased the net supply of\nliquidity to the banking system. Open market operations by the trading desk at the New York\nFed maintained the interbank federal funds rate at the FOMC’s target by adding or draining\nreserves. Thus, lending to individual banks was automatically offset by a sterilizing drain of\nreserves through the sale of U.S. government securities. The “logjam” was not an insufficient\nsupply of reserves to the banking system; if anything, the supply of reserves to individual banks\nwas the problem.\nThis observation points toward an alternative diagnosis of the situation: The deterioration in\nhousing market conditions was inducing fundamental revisions in beliefs about the probability\ndistributions governing the returns on housing-related financial assets. These revisions were\nsometimes sudden, sometimes not, but they resulted in a cumulative deterioration in the\nperceived creditworthiness of asset pools exposed to housing-related losses. For various reasons,\nABCP issuers were unwilling to sell at prices that buyers wanted to pay, and they were willing to\nbear the consequences by taking the assets onto their balance sheets for a time or by drawing\ndown lines of credit. In essence, volume fell in the ABCP market because the supply was so\nelastic. The ABCP market didn’t “seize up” under this interpretation, it simply moved\nelsewhere. 7 In short, the so-called logjam in the ABCP market looked like a price-discovery\nprocess: Information was emerging and being digested, and market participants were groping\ntoward a new view. That process might take a long time to resolve and require substantial\nreintermediation, but it does not indicate a market failure that the Fed needs to step in and fix.\nEvidence from research conducted since 2007 is consistent with the notion that increases in\ncounterparty credit risk drove the financial market turmoil that summer and fall. A study by\nDaniel M. Covitz, Nellie Liang and Gustavo A. Suarez shows that the extent to which\ncounterparties pulled away from issuers of ABCP was directly related to the extent of their\nholdings of risky housing-related assets. 8 And work by John Taylor and John Williams suggests\nthat the evidence on the behavior of interest rate spreads around that time is consistent with\nfluctuations in counterparty risk. 9 While these research results were not available to\npolicymakers in real time, they do support the hypothesis that markets were responding in a\nplausibly efficient manner to significant revisions in expectations about the underlying economic\nfundamentals.\nApart from the specifics of what was happening in the ABCP market, I’d also like to comment\nmore generally on the modern interpretation of the phrase “lender of last resort.” During the\nconference call, it was noted that “The benefit of [lender-of-last-resort activity] is that it’s\ndirectly related to the functioning of markets. It’s a traditional central bank approach to dealing\nwith disorderly markets.” 10 The idea of the central bank as the lender of last resort comes from\nwritings of Henry Thornton in the early 1800s and Walter Bagehot in the 1870s regarding the\nBank of England. 11 Bagehot’s work is generally paraphrased as “Lend freely on good collateral\nat penalty interest rates,” which would seem to describe the Fed’s actions during the financial\ncrisis.\n3\n\n\fOur current financial system is quite different from that of 19th century England, however. At\nthat time, a central bank loan to a bank necessarily increased the money supply, and lending was\nthe primary way the central bank managed the stock of coins and paper bank notes in circulation.\nAt times, a large number of bank customers would seek to convert their deposits into notes and\ncoins. When Bagehot advocated central bank lending during a crisis, he was advocating an\nexpansion in the supply of circulating bank notes and coins to meet the increase in demand. Both\nThornton’s and Bagehot’s writings make clear that they were not recommending rescues for\ninsolvent institutions and that their prescriptions were about monetary policy, not credit policy. 12\nIn contrast, the Fed’s emergency lending programs during the crisis did not increase the net\nsupply of liquid assets to the economy. Under modern interest rate targeting procedures, open\nmarket operations take care of expanding the aggregate supply of money to meet demand. Fed\nlending during the crisis was offset by sales of Treasury securities, so the supply of currency plus\nreserves did not increase. Instead, the lending programs simply reallocated credit, effectively\nselling Treasury securities to the public and using the proceeds to provide funds to private\nentities on terms they would not otherwise have obtained in the marketplace. The Fed’s lending\nthus constituted credit allocation ― that is, fiscal policy ― and not the monetary policy\nThornton and Bagehot had in mind. 13\nThe Term Auction Facility\nPolicymakers’ concerns about bank funding did not subside following the August 2007 reduction\nin the discount rate. In September, the Committee discussed, and in December initiated, the Term\nAuction Facility (TAF) in order to further improve the terms on which banks could obtain credit\nfrom the Fed. Under this program, term discount window loans were auctioned off to eligible\nbanking institutions. 14 The resulting rates tended to be much lower than the prevailing discount\nrate.\nOne rationale for the TAF was to overcome the perceived stigma of borrowing from the discount\nwindow, which was said to be limiting the response to the lower rates on discount window loans.\nEven though discount window lending was strictly confidential, market participants were\nsometimes able to infer that a particular bank had been unable to obtain market funding and as a\nresult probably had turned to the window. I was not aware of any models of stigma in bank\nlending at that time. Some time later, Huberto Ennis and John Weinberg produced a model of\nstigma, but they did not analyze policy interventions. 15 In December 2007, I argued in a letter to\nthe FOMC that the notion of stigma in bank lending suggested adverse selection might be\ninterfering with market functioning. 16 I was trying to give the benefit of the doubt to the case for\nintervention. Stigma suggests a separating equilibrium, however, and the design of the TAF\nprogram seemed inconsistent with attaining a better equilibrium. Instead, it seemed designed to\nsubsidize the borrowing costs of riskier banks. The public policy rationale of such crosssubsidies was not obvious.\nAnother rationale advanced at that time was the notion that some financial asset prices might\nhave been driven inefficiently low as the result of “cash-in-the-market” pricing. In chapter 9 of\ntheir book Understanding Financial Crises, Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale describe a model\n4\n\n\fin which the only available buyers have insufficient cash to pay the fundamental value, and so\nthe asset trades at an inefficient discount. 17 The asset price is the ratio of investor cash to the\nquantity of assets for sale. In this model, central bank lending to banks collateralized by the asset\nin question alleviates the problem and restores prices to their “fundamental” value. In a similar\nvein, the broader notion of “firesales” rests on the premise that barriers to market participation\nresult in prices that can, at least for a time, be depressed below their “fundamental” values.\nThis class of models did not seem persuasive as a relevant representation of market conditions at\nthe time. 18 Banks did not seem to be facing forced asset sales, and there were widespread\naccounts of money sitting on the sidelines while investors waited for more attractive prices.\nThere were no apparent barriers to the participation of a wide array of investors in markets for\nvarious financial instruments, and it wasn’t clear that asset valuations had deviated much from\ntheir fundamental values. Exceptionally low payoffs on mortgage-backed securities were not\ninconceivable and could easily have coincided with rather dire aggregate economic conditions.\nThus, relatively high risk premia and relatively low security prices did not strike me as\nunwarranted.\nInherent Versus Induced Fragility\nThe next key moment in the crisis was the March 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan\nChase, with assistance from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that effectively protected\nBear’s creditors from the fallout of an unassisted failure. That moment illustrates a broader\ntheme underlying the events of 2007 and 2008: The extent to which fragility is not inherent in\nthe functioning of financial markets, but rather induced by the government’s provision of the\nvery backstop that is meant to be stability-enhancing.\nDeposit insurance is one obvious example, 19 and we saw the moral hazard created by federal\ndeposit insurance reach the boiling point during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, 20 at a\ncost to taxpayers of $124 billion. And beginning in 1970, the Fed and other regulators began to\nintervene in credit markets in ways that protected uninsured creditors of large financial firms.\nFirst was the railroad Penn Central Transportation Company, which defaulted on $82 million in\ncommercial paper obligations. The Fed responded by encouraging banks to borrow from the Fed\nto purchase commercial paper, thus providing support to securities markets. In 1972, the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) gave the $1.2 billion Bank of the Commonwealth a $60\nmillion line of credit that prevented its failure. 21 In 1974, the Fed lent $1.7 billion to Franklin\nNational Bank and assumed $725 million of its foreign exchange book. In 1984, the failing $40\nbillion bank Continental Illinois was able to borrow from the discount window even as it was\nreceiving a capital injection from the FDIC. In 1998, we organized a $3.6 billion rescue of the\nhedge fund Long Term Capital Management. 22\nThe net result of this history has been a large increase in the fraction of our financial system that\nis covered by explicit and implicit government guarantees. At the end of 1999, the government\nsafety net covered 45 percent of financial sector liabilities, according to Richmond Fed\nresearchers. By the end of 2011, that number had grown to 57 percent, about the same size it was\nat the end of 2009, despite the many new regulations we have put in place since the crisis. 23\n\n5\n\n\fPrior to 2007, but certainly by March 2008, investors arguably viewed the Federal Reserve as\nquite likely to intervene to prevent creditor losses at large financial institutions. While that\nexpectation was undoubtedly strong for the large bank holding companies, instances of\nintervention in response to financial distress outside of the banking system are likely to have\ncontributed to the expectation of support for the large investment banks as well, especially after\nthe Gramm-Leach-Bliley legislation in 1999 placed them on more even regulatory footing with\nthe bank holding companies. And the policy actions of late 2007 that I’ve already discussed\nplausibly conveyed the message that the Federal Reserve viewed its lending as an appropriate\nremedy for credit market disruptions. This would have discouraged troubled institutions such as\nBear or Lehman Brothers from incurring the costs of raising additional equity or reducing their\nreliance on short-term funding.\nThis safety net creates two mutually reinforcing conditions that seriously distort the incentives of\nfinancial market participants to monitor and control risk. First, creditors of some financial\ninstitutions feel protected by an implicit government commitment of support should the\ninstitution become financially troubled. Second, policymakers often feel compelled to provide\nsupport to certain financial institutions to insulate creditors from losses. These instances of\ngovernment intervention over time have reinforced creditors' expectations of support and thereby\ndampened incentives to contain risk-taking. This has promoted financial firms of greater size,\ncomplexity and interconnectedness and encouraged greater leverage and more reliance on highly\nliquid short-term funding. In this view, the apparent fragility of modern financial market\narrangements is not entirely a force of nature. Instead, the narrative I’ve sketched out here\nsuggests that financial instability is a consequence of the moral hazard effect of expected official\nintervention.\nThe thesis that financial market instability is inherent, rather than induced by poor policies, must\nalso confront the fact that instances of instability are quite unevenly distributed across different\ncountries and different regulatory regimes, as exemplified by the contrasting experiences of the\nUnited States and Canada. Over the past 180 years, the United States has experienced 14 major\nbanking crises, compared with just two mild illiquidity episodes in Canada over the same\nperiod. 24 If financial fragility were an inherent feature of financial markets, financial panics\nwould be ubiquitous, but that’s not what we see.\nI do want to emphasize that to my knowledge Fed policymakers during the crisis were genuinely\nconcerned that the problems in financial markets might have costly consequences for the real\neconomy and the American people. With that concern in mind, they acted in what they thought\nwas the best interest of the economy and the public. But I see the dilemma as resulting in part\nfrom a dreadful time-consistency problem. Decades of rescues had given rise to expectations of\nfurther rescues, which just encouraged high leverage and fragile funding arrangements.\nDisappointing those expectations would have limited moral hazard but forced investors to revise\ntheir expectations about future Fed support and reconfigure and reposition their investments\naccordingly. This would likely have been a turbulent process.\nOne more crisis moment deserves comment. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on\nSeptember 15, 2008. One day later, the insurance company American International Group (AIG)\nreceived a large credit extension from the New York Fed. 25 At that point, regulators had resolved\n6\n\n\fsix large failing financial firms in five different ways. Some positions in the capital structure\nwere rescued in one firm’s resolution but not rescued in another’s. Each had been handled on an\nad hoc basis, without comment on how similar cases might be handled in the future. Market\nconditions following Lehman and AIG cried out for a general policy statement providing\nguidance on future interventions. But at that point it would have been very hard for policymakers\nto articulate a credible policy that differentiated between firms or investors. The most expedient\npath to stability was to throw in the towel and backstop anything in question. To persuade\nCongress to provide the legislative authority to do so, even scarier words were invoked ―\n“another Great Depression,” for example. I believe the resulting shock to consumers’ and\nbusinesses’ expectations significantly deepened the recession already underway.\nSuggestions for Researchers\nI promised at the outset that I would share some suggestions for the economic researchers in the\nroom, and I turn to that task now. First, though, commendations are necessary. The progress\nmade on the theory of banking and financial intermediation in the last few decades has been\nprofound, and we owe that progress to many of the people here today.\nSecond, a characterization is in order: There is a sense in which the models that were cited to\njustify the interventions that began in 2007 are simply “possibility theorems.” They are strippeddown, bare-bones models demonstrating that under a specific set of assumptions government\nintervention of the type we saw can be efficiency enhancing. Let me be clear: I am not criticizing\nstripped-down models, per se; indeed, I doubt we could make much progress in economics\nwithout them. In fact, I wrote down a few simple models myself back in the day. In order to\nisolate a theoretical phenomenon you’ve identified, you eliminate all the unnecessary details,\nleaving only the essential features, as in a chess puzzle where every piece on the board plays a\nrole in the solution. This puts the economics of the issue in stark relief so that it can be better\nunderstood and subjected to further study by other researchers.\nBut there is a large gap between such models and the needs of policymakers, because they often\nprovide us with little guidance on how critical assumptions compare to the real world. Often the\npredictions of models in which policy interventions play a useful role are qualitatively\nindistinguishable from the predictions of models in which markets are fairly well functioning and\nintervention does not enhance efficiency. To take a simple but relevant example, “firesales,” in\nwhich financial assets are trading below their fundamental value due to limited participation or\nmarket segmentation, can be hard to distinguish from downward revisions in expected returns. In\nboth cases, prices and quantities fall.\nTo choose between the two competing policy recommendations therefore requires some\nadditional information. Some other aspect of the models needs to be compared to observations in\norder to discriminate between them. One possibility is to bring quantitative information to bear\non the problem. For example, one could estimate the fundamental value of the financial assets in\nquestion to see if market prices seemed to diverge significantly. During the crisis, however, this\ntended to lead to an impasse. Estimates of fundamental values based on risk neutrality pointed to\nlarge deviations in market prices. But it seemed quite plausible that investors anticipated a high\ncorrelation between realized returns and their wealth — that is, if very large losses materialized,\n7\n\n\faggregate economic conditions were likely to be very bad. In essence, large risk premia could\nnot be ruled out and very low fundamental values were quite plausible.\nThat leaves us with comparing the assumptions built into the model environments, which leads\nnaturally to a suggestion for the economic research community. I think it would be very useful to\nsee more effort devoted to comparing specific model features, particularly information and\ntechnology assumptions, to actual observations. For example, how do the frictions that generate\nmarket segmentation stack up against modern market settings, in which traders are often\nphysically isolated but communications technologies are very inexpensive? And we know that\nthe sequential service constraint — in which depositors seeking withdrawals are isolated from\neach other and have only one interaction per period with their banker — is essential to the classic\nDiamond-Dybvig model of bank runs as multiple equilibria. Is the sequential service constraint a\ngood representation of networks of traders linked by modern telecommunications services?\nFor me personally, and I believe for my fellow policymakers as well, more work focused on\nvalidating the technological and informational assumptions underlying models of financial\nmarket frictions would greatly help narrow the range of defensible disagreements on the\nrelevance of any given model. In a sense, I am urging more horse races between various models\nof “possibility theorems” and models in which observed outcomes are reasonably efficient.\nI have another suggestion as well. The induced-fragility narrative places expectational\nconsiderations center stage. This suggests that for financial stability it’s critical to achieve a\ncommitment to limiting intervention, since constraining risk-taking ex ante through tougher\nregulation is likely to prove fallible. I’ve spoken on several other occasions on this theme and\nabout the path toward better policy. 26 Achieving financial stability also is likely to require\novercoming distributional motivations. Training in modern welfare economics conditions one to\ndissect and debate the efficiency rationales for intervention. As I have reflected over time on\npolicymaking during the crisis, I have come to see the impulse to intervene as driven less by exante or even ex-post efficiency considerations and more by sheer distributional concerns.\nExternalities, in the strict sense, are hard to identify with rigor in markets in which everyone is\nconnected by chains of voluntary transactions. As the FOMC transcripts will show, scary words\nand language about protecting financial markets and Main Street were far more prominent than\ndiscussions of the efficiency properties of policy proposals. In hindsight, I wish more\nconsideration had been given to the possibility that, as with the fight against inflation, protecting\npeople over the long run can unfortunately require incurring quite substantial short-run costs.\nMy suggestion here is for more work on the political economy of financial market intervention.\nCharles Calomiris and Stephen Haber have a provocative new book called Fragile By Design in\nwhich they explore the connection between the structure of countries’ political institutions and\nthe extent of policy-induced financial fragility. 27 This strikes me as an immensely promising\nresearch vein and one that is likely to yield substantial insights, because it focuses on the\ndistributional considerations that I think were dominant in the crisis.\nConclusion\n\n8\n\n\fI’ll conclude simply with a reminder that the stakes are high for making progress. I’ll also point\nout that episodes of macroeconomic and monetary instability in the 1930s and the 1970s\ngenerated bursts of research that immensely deepened our understanding and led, arguably, to\nbetter policy. I hope that the current crisis-induced burst of interest in financial intermediation\nwill yield similar payoffs in the years ahead, perhaps with your help. I look forward to seeing the\nbenefits of that research.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero, John Weinberg and Kartik Athreya for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nFor example, see Federal Open Market Committee, “Conference Call of the Federal Open Market Committee on\nAugust 16, 2007,” and “Meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 11, 2007.”\n3\nMilton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, Princeton, N.J.: Princeton\nUniversity Press, 1963.\n4\nFOMC (August 16, 2007)\n5\nFOMC (August 16, 2007), pp. 3-4\n6\nFOMC (August 16, 2007), p. 8.

            "content": "The Path to Financial Stability\nFebruary 11, 2014\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nStanford Institute for Economic Policy Research\nStanford University, Stanford, California\n\nThank you very much for inviting me to speak with you today. This institute is doing excellent\nand important work to further our understanding of economic policy, and I appreciate the\nopportunity to share my perspectives as both an economist and a policymaker. Today, I’d like to\ntalk about the financial turmoil of 2007 and 2008, and some of the policies that contributed to\nthose unhappy events. I will argue that our response to the crisis has failed to address what\nremains the most critical issue facing our financial system: institutions that are deemed “too big\nto fail,” or, more precisely, too big to fail without a government-funded creditor rescue. I will\nalso talk about a path toward a more stable and less dependent financial system. Before I begin, I\nshould note that my views are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nWhat is the nature of the problem? In my view it is best described as two mutually reinforcing\nconditions that seriously distort the incentives of financial market participants to monitor and\ncontrol risk. First, creditors of some financial institutions feel protected by an implicit\ngovernment commitment of support should the institution become financially troubled. Second,\npolicymakers often feel compelled to provide support to certain financial institutions to insulate\ncreditors from losses.\nThe way the second condition reinforces the first should be fairly clear. Instances of government\nintervention reinforce creditors' expectations of support and thereby dampen incentives to\ncontain risk-taking. This promotes financial firms of greater size, complexity and\ninterconnectedness, and it also encourages greater leverage and more reliance on highly liquid\nshort-term funding. Thus, the apparent fragility of modern financial market arrangements is not\nentirely a force of nature. Instead, financial instability should be seen as a consequence of the\nmoral hazard effect of official intervention.\nCreditor expectations of support, in turn, often compel policymakers to intervene in the event of\ndistress, since disappointing those expectations by withholding support could provoke a sudden,\nturbulent readjustment of investor beliefs regarding support for other, similarly situated firms.\nConcern about exacerbating moral hazard takes a back seat to the urgently felt need to stem the\nvolatility that would result from disappointed expectations. Perceived guarantees thus encourage\nfragility, which induces interventions, which encourages further fragility. The ultimate result of\nthis cycle is taxpayer-funded subsidies to financial firms that are widely viewed as deeply unfair.\n\n1\n\n\fWhat we have is a fundamental flaw in the relationship between government and the financial\nsector. And the impact of this flaw is growing. At the end of 1999, the government safety net —\nincluding both the implicit support I just outlined and explicit support provided by programs\nsuch as deposit insurance and pension guarantees — covered 45 percent of financial sector\nliabilities, according to Richmond Fed researchers. By the end of 2011, that number had grown\nto 57 percent, about the same size it was at the end of 2009, despite the many new regulations we\nhave put in place since the crisis. 2 I believe many of these new regulations are quite valuable,\ngiven where we found ourselves in 2009, but I do not believe that enhanced regulations will, by\nthemselves, solve the “too big to fail” problem. Instead, we need measures that give market\nparticipants an incentive to develop resilient financial arrangements and that end the expectation\nof government support. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 provides some important tools to help us\ndo so, but further legislation would be useful as well. This work will not be easy, but I believe it\nis absolutely necessary if we hope to make financial stability compatible with democracy.\nHow Did We Get Here?\nThe origins of “too big to fail” can be traced back to the Emergency Banking Act of 1933, which\nmarks the beginning of federal deposit insurance in this country. This Act was signed after a tidal\nwave of bank failures between 1929 and 1933, when more than one-third of the country’s\nroughly 25,000 banks failed; entire states declared bank holidays, followed by the declaration of\na nationwide bank holiday in March 1933. 3 Depositor losses and the disturbances in the payment\nsystem were enormously disruptive. At the time, the U.S. banking system was highly\nfragmented: Interstate branching was prohibited and only eight states and the District of\nColumbia allowed statewide branching. This meant banks were unable to diversify risks across\nregions or head off bank runs by moving funds between branches. Most communities in the\ncountry were served by just a few small local banks that were highly vulnerable to local\neconomic shocks. 4\nOne popular account of this episode holds that the crisis was caused by self-fulfilling depositor\npanic: Fearing failure, people rushed to withdraw their funds, thus ensuring that failure occurred.\nBut modern scholarship has concluded that the crisis was in fact the result of fundamental shocks\nto the solvency of the banking system. The Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to\ncollapse. The resulting severe deflation — a 28 percent decline in average prices over three years\n— drove many bank borrowers into default. Bank runs contributed to the decline in the money\nstock, but the Fed could have offset the effects through open market purchases of securities. 5\nThese shocks were then exacerbated by the fragmented banking system. 6 The most striking\nevidence for this is the contrasting case of Canada, a country that experienced similar economic\nshocks but whose banking laws allowed consolidation. As a result, there were no serious banking\npanics, despite the lack of a central bank. 7\nLegislators were well aware that branching restrictions contributed to banking panics, but\npolicymakers did not respond to the crisis by eliminating the restrictions on branching. The unit\nbanking system was popular with politically influential populist and agrarian groups, and these\nforces lobbied instead for a system of government-provided deposit insurance that would\npreserve small local banks by protecting their depositors. Although there was significant\nopposition to the idea of deposit insurance — including by President Roosevelt and Sen. Carter\n2\n\n\fGlass, an architect of the Federal Reserve System — the supporters prevailed. In fact, it was not\nuntil the 1990s that banks were allowed to open branches both within states and across state\nlines. 8\nThe obvious drawback to deposit insurance is that it creates moral hazard: Bankers have an\nincentive to make riskier investments, and depositors have less incentive to monitor the risktaking behavior of their banks. 9 We saw these incentive problems come to a head during the\nsavings and loan crisis of the 1980s, when hundreds of federally insured savings and loan\ninstitutions failed, bankrupting the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and costing\ntaxpayers an estimated $124 billion. While many factors contributed to the savings and loan\ndebacle, it is unlikely that it could have reached the proportions it did without the distorted\nincentives created by federal deposit insurance. 10\nThe proponents of deposit insurance cannot take all the blame for “too big to fail,” however.\nBeginning in 1970, the Fed and other regulators began to intervene in credit markets in ways that\nprotected uninsured creditors of large financial firms. First, the railroad Penn Central\nTransportation Company defaulted on $82 million in commercial paper obligations. The Fed\nresponded by encouraging banks to borrow from the Fed to purchase commercial paper, thus\nproviding support to securities markets. In 1972, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) gave the $1.2 billion Bank of the Commonwealth a $60 million line of credit that\nprevented its failure. 11 In 1974, the Fed lent $1.7 billion to Franklin National Bank and assumed\n$725 million of its foreign exchange book. In 1984, the failing $40 billion bank Continental\nIllinois was able to borrow from the discount window even as it was receiving a capital injection\nfrom the FDIC.\nThe precedents set by these actions, along with many others, led many economists to be\nconcerned about the issue of “too big to fail” even before the recent financial crisis. In 2004,\nGary Stern, then the president of the Minneapolis Fed, and Ron Feldman, an executive vice\npresident at the Minneapolis Fed, published the book “Too Big to Fail: The Hazards of Bank\nBailouts.” In it, they warned that “the TBTF problem is real, costly, and becoming more\nsevere.” 12 Unfortunately, they were proven correct just a few short years later.\nBecause the financial crisis of 2007–08 has been the subject of numerous popular accounts, you\nare no doubt familiar with the dramatic sequence of events. So instead of telling the tale yet\nagain, I will just point out some important highlights that are suggested by the perspective of the\ntwo mutually reinforcing expectations I referenced at the outset of my remarks. In 2007\nestimates of the losses likely to be experienced on subprime mortgages rose significantly. This\ncaused investors to revise their assessments of financial entities deemed likely to be exposed to\nthose losses. As a consequence, the credit terms available to these entities deteriorated. The risk\npremia on their obligations in wholesale funding markets rose, and the maturity of the\nobligations they were able to issue was sharply reduced.\nIn August 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee took its first step in response to the tumult\nin financial markets by lowering the interest rate charged on discount window loans to banks and\nencouraging banks to borrow. Then in December 2007, in response to rising interest rates in\ninterbank lending markets, the Fed launched the Term Auction Facility to provide term loans to\n3\n\n\fdepository institutions. The guiding principle behind these actions, and others that followed, was\nthat credit markets were malfunctioning and the remedy was additional central bank lending.\nArguably, however, market participants inferred that the Fed was standing by, ready to rescue\nthe creditors of financial institutions that showed signs of distress — which actually occurred the\nfollowing spring when the New York Fed helped finance the purchase of Bear Stearns by\nJPMorgan. These actions are likely to have reduced the incentives of other large financial firms,\nsuch as Lehman Brothers, to strengthen their positions by raising additional equity or reducing\ntheir reliance on short-term funding. Capital markets were clearly open for the large financial\ninstitutions prior to the middle of 2008, as demonstrated by the equity issuance that did occur.\nBut not enough new capital was raised; apparently the costliness of shareholder dilution made it\nmore attractive for large financial firms to rely instead on the implied backstop of government\nsupport.\nPolicymakers were certainly aware that their actions might exacerbate moral hazard. And\ncertainly, we can all understand a bias against inaction when faced with an unknown, but\npotentially grave, outcome. But the distortion in banks’ risk-taking incentives was viewed as a\nlong-run issue to trade off against the immediate value of cushioning an imminent blow to\nfinancial market functioning. Because financial crises are relatively infrequent, it was thought,\nthe incentive distortion would only affect outcomes in the relatively distant future, leaving\nsufficient time for policymakers to contain moral hazard effects through tougher regulation. But\nthe crisis we have just been through tells a different story. It wasn’t just some distant future crisis\nthat was affected by the precedents being set; it was the next chapter in the current crisis. Each\nnew move to expand institutions’ use of Fed lending also had the effect of increasing\nexpectations of official support in the months ahead.\nDuring the crisis, and still today, many people view government-provided backstops to large\nfinancial firms as a necessity to prevent financial system malfunctions. You’ve likely heard that\ncentral banks should act as a “lender of last resort.” This idea is often attributed to Henry\nThornton, a British economist who wrote an influential book on central banking in the 1800s,\nand Walter Bagehot, a British essayist and journalist who wrote his book on central banking in\nthe 1870s. 13 But Thornton and Bagehot wrote when lending was the primary mechanism by\nwhich the Bank of England increased the circulating stock of money — coins and paper bank\nnotes — when the demand for those instruments increased. Their writings make clear that they\nwere not recommending rescues for insolvent institutions. Their prescriptions thus were about\nmonetary policy, not credit policy. 14\nIn contrast, the Fed’s emergency lending programs did not increase the net supply of liquid\nassets to the economy. Fed lending was offset by sales of Treasury securities, so the supply of\ncurrency plus reserves did not increase. Instead, the lending programs reallocated credit,\neffectively selling Treasury securities to the public and using the proceeds to provide funds to\nprivate entities on terms they would not otherwise have obtained in the marketplace. The Fed’s\nlending thus constituted credit allocation, a form of fiscal policy, not the monetary policy\nThornton and Bagehot had in mind. 15\nThe idea that public sector backstops are a necessity is often motivated more broadly by\ntheoretical models based on “multiple equilibria” or market segmentation in which outcomes are\n4\n\n\finherently unstable or suboptimal in the absence of government support. 16 I have not found these\nmodels terribly persuasive as accounts of the financial market phenomena that we grappled with\nat various points during the crisis, because the critical frictions on which these theories are based\nseem at odds with observations. More broadly, the thesis that financial market instability is\ninherent, rather than induced by poor policies, must confront the fact that instances of instability\nare quite unevenly distributed across different countries and different regulatory regimes, as\nexemplified by the contrasting experiences of the United States and Canada not only during the\n1930s but throughout these countries’ histories. 17 If financial fragility were an inherent feature of\nfinancial markets, financial panics would be ubiquitous, but that’s not what we see.\nThe Regulatory Response\nThe government’s main response in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis was the DoddFrank Act, a 2,300-page piece of legislation passed in 2010 that was designed to address the\nperceived weaknesses in the financial system that led to the crisis. Dodd-Frank put in place\nroughly 400 new rules, created a new federal agency and has required a tremendous amount of\nhard work from people throughout our regulatory system. But it also fails to address the central\nproblem.\nOne broad strategy of the Dodd-Frank Act is to address “too big to fail” by preventing failure in\nthe first place. The Act provides for enhanced supervision of large financial firms via stronger\ncapital and liquidity requirements, periodic stress-testing, counterparty credit limits and riskmanagement requirements, among other measures. Beefing up such ex-ante constraints on risktaking is important, but it’s not infallible. New opportunities for risk-taking will always emerge\nas financial markets and economies evolve, and it is asking a lot to expect front-line supervisors\nto forever substitute for well-aligned incentives. Moreover, stronger restraints on risk-taking\nincrease the incentive for market participants to find a way to operate outside the regulated\nsector. This regulatory bypass gives rise to what’s come to be called “shadow banking” — banklike activities conducted outside the legal confines of the banking industry. Shadow banking\narrangements played a major role in the financial crisis; paradoxically, some of these\narrangements were the result of past financial regulations intended to prevent crises. Expanding\nregulation to chase down fragility wherever it appears is not a promising strategy.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created a new mechanism to resolve large financial firms that become\ndistressed in spite of enhanced supervision. Title II of the Act established the Orderly\nLiquidation Authority, or OLA, which gives the FDIC the ability, with the agreement of other\nfinancial regulators, to take a firm into receivership. The FDIC also is able to borrow funds from\nthe U.S. Treasury to make payments to creditors of the failed firm or to guarantee the liabilities\nof the failed firm. The funds are to be repaid from recoveries on the assets of the firm or from\nassessments against the largest, most complex financial companies.\nWhile the FDIC must pay creditors at least what they would have received in a liquidation of the\nfirm, the Act does give the FDIC broad discretion to pay some creditors more than bankruptcy\nwould allow. Moreover, the ability to inject funds borrowed from the Treasury allows the FDIC\nto immediately pay off creditors whose claims would otherwise be subject to bankruptcy\nproceedings. Short-term creditors are likely to believe they will benefit from the FDIC’s\n5\n\n\fdiscretion, causing them to pay insufficient attention to risk and to invest in fragile funding\narrangements. If expectations of support for the creditors of financially distressed institutions are\nwidespread, regulators will likely feel forced to provide support to these short-term creditors to\navoid the turbulence of disappointing expectations. Rather than ending “too big to fail,” this\nwould replicate the two mutually reinforcing expectations that define it.\nThe Path Forward\nIf more regulation isn’t the answer, what is? In my view, ending these mutually reinforcing\nproblems requires bringing about two alternative mutually reinforcing conditions. The first is\nthat creditors do not expect government support in the event of financial distress. If we can\nachieve that, private sector financial firms and their creditors will have the incentive to avoid\nfragile financing arrangements and to limit risk-taking, thereby reducing the pressure for\ngovernment intervention. The second necessary condition is that policymakers actually do allow\nfinancial firms to fail without government support. If we can make unassisted failures\nmanageable, then policymakers could credibly commit to forgoing rescues, thereby improving\nprivate sector incentives.\nThere are several steps we can take to create a credible path to failure without external\ngovernment support. The first is to rigorously implement the provision in the Dodd-Frank Act\nthat requires large and complex financial institutions to create resolution plans, also known as\n“living wills.” These are detailed plans that explain how a financial institution could be wound\ndown under U.S. bankruptcy laws without threatening the rest of the financial system or\nrequiring a public bailout. The plans explain how to disentangle the many different legal entities\n— sometimes numbering in the thousands — that make up a large financial firm. Under the\nDodd-Frank Act, large banks and other “systemically important” firms are required to submit\nthese plans on an annual basis for review by the Fed and the FDIC. The first wave of filers has\nmade two rounds of submissions.\nResolution planning provides a structured approach for understanding what’s likely to happen in\nthe event that a large financial firm should fail. In contrast, in past crises policymakers found\nthemselves with little or no preparatory work to draw on. In fact, resolution planning has proven\nvaluable already by giving participating firms a more detailed understanding of their legal\nstructure, and many have used them to “clean up” their structure and close down unneeded legal\nentities.\nMore to the point, however, if resolution plans indicate that bankruptcy would pose a risk to the\nsystem as a whole, regulators can order changes in the structure and operations of a firm in order\nto make it resolvable in bankruptcy without government assistance. The Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC can jointly determine that a plan is \"not credible\" or would not facilitate an orderly\nresolution under the bankruptcy code, in which case the firm would be required to submit a\nrevised plan to address identified deficiencies. A resubmission could include plans to change the\nfunding strategy, business operations and corporate structure in order to eliminate deficiencies. If\nthe Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not remedy identified\ndeficiencies, they can require more capital, increase liquidity requirements or restrict the growth,\nactivities or operations of the firm.\n6\n\n\fThe immense complexity and scale of large banking organizations might make bankruptcy\nplanning appear daunting. Indeed, this has led some to suggest that government-funded\nresolutions under Title II should be our main strategy in cases of financial distress. I do not think\nsuch a defeatist attitude is warranted, however. Certainly, the needed alterations to the structure\nand operations of large financial firms will be unpopular with the firms since they are likely to\ninvolve reductions in reliance on short-term funding and derivatives, and the adoption of more\neasily severable subsidiary structures. But I believe these changes are feasible without sacrificing\nany inherent benefits those institutions provide to the economy. The largest obstacle to credible\nliving wills, in my view, might be mustering the political will to compel needed changes rather\nthan defaulting to continued dependence on government backstops.\nAnother useful step toward financial stability would be to critically examine the bankruptcy code\nitself and look for ways to better adapt it to the business of large financial firms, particularly\nthose that rely heavily on short-term funding to finance longer-term assets. In fact, such work has\nbeen underway here at Stanford as part of the Resolution Project of the Hoover Institution. 18 This\nwork and that of other scholars, such as Mark Roe of Harvard University, has highlighted the\nfact that many short-term financing instruments and derivatives are exempt from bankruptcy's\nautomatic stay. This safe harbor treatment arguably over-encourages the use of such instruments,\nand thereby enhances the growth and fragility of shadow banking. Some have proposed limiting\nthis exemption, as well as adding a new chapter to the bankruptcy code specifically adapted to\nlarge financial firms. 19 These reform proposals strike me as compelling and worthy of serious\nconsideration.\nA third step toward financial stability is to identify regulatory or legal impediments to private\nsector arrangements that would reduce instability. One example is money market mutual funds,\nwhich benefited from substantial official support at the height of the crisis in 2008. 20 These\nfunds’ asset holdings are restricted to short-term financial instruments, and they operate very\nmuch like bank accounts but without the overlay of banking regulation and supervision. (Indeed,\nmoney market mutual funds arose in the 1970s and became popular as a means of bypassing\nregulatory limits on bank deposit interest rates.) Regulations stipulate that if the value of a fund's\nassets falls below the value it has promised to investors — if it \"breaks the buck\" — then the\nfund must be liquidated. Money funds thus are prevented from temporarily suspending full\npayment in the event of difficulty, although such suspensions have allowed institutions in other\nsettings to staunch destabilizing runs. In the recent crisis, for example, many hedge funds\navoided instability and preserved value by delaying redemptions. We should eliminate the\nregulations that artificially prevent money market funds and other financial intermediaries from\nstructuring themselves in ways that reduce their fragility and vulnerability to runs.\nA final step may be required before financial stability can be assured. Market participants must\nhave well-anchored expectations that government-funded rescues will not be forthcoming.\nIdeally, policymakers would act in a manner that is consistent with those expectations. But in\nturbulent times, as we’ve seen, it may be tempting to put seemingly urgent short-run\nconsiderations ahead of preserving a record of precedents that keep market expectations wellanchored. Complete credibility of a commitment to forgo rescues may be difficult if regulators\nretain discretionary authority to intervene. This is a particular danger for central banks, whose\n7\n\n\findependent balance sheet places their fiscal actions beyond the scope of the legislative\nappropriations process. 21 Credible commitment to orderly unassisted resolutions thus may\nrequire eliminating the government’s ability to provide ad hoc rescues. This would mean\nrepealing the Federal Reserve’s remaining emergency lending powers. And once robust and\ncredible resolution plans are in place, we would be able to responsibly wind down the FDIC’s\nOrderly Liquidation Authority and related financing mechanisms.\nIn concert, I believe these actions can enable us to create a financial system where market\nparticipants don’t expect government support and thus fund themselves responsibly; where\ntaxpayers aren’t on the hook for institutions with the wrong incentives; but where financial\ninstitutions can effectively provide the services a dynamic and innovative economy requires.\nThis is going to be hard work, and from some vantage points it might even look impossible. But\nthe alternative seems even less promising — the specter of an ever-increasing share of the\nfinancial sector effectively guaranteed by taxpayers. That prospect is unlikely to serve our\ncountry well. So I believe we owe it to our citizens to do whatever work it takes to create a stable\nand resilient financial system.\n\nI would like to thank Jessie Romero for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nThe Richmond Fed’s estimates of the size of the safety net are available online.\n3 Kris James Mitchener, “Bank Supervision, Regulation, and Instability During the Great\nDepression,” National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper no. 10475, May 2004.\n4 More information about the banking panics, the bank holiday of 1933 and the Emergency Banking\nAct of 1933 is available at federalreservehistory.org.\n5 Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, Princeton, N.J.:\nPrinceton University Press, 1963. As Friedman and Schwartz noted, monetary policy, not bank\nfailures, was the primary cause of the severe economic contraction: “If [failures] had occurred to\nprecisely the same extent without producing a drastic decline in the stock of money, they would have\nbeen notable but not crucial. If they had not occurred, but a correspondingly sharp decline had been\nproduced in the stock of money by some other means, the contraction would have been at least\nequally severe and probably even more so” (p. 352).\n6 See Charles Calomiris, “Banking Crises and the Rules of the Game,” National Bureau of Economic\nResearch Working Paper no. 15403, October 2009; and Mitchener (2004).\n7 Although Canada had zero bank runs or failures in the same time period, it did have a severe\ndepression after its money supply declined by 13 percent (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, p. 352).

            "content": "Economic Outlook, February 2014\nFebruary 4, 2004\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nShenandoah University\nWinchester, Virginia\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the economic outlook for the year ahead. This year\nis a special one for the Federal Reserve ― our centennial year. The Federal Reserve Act was\nsigned into law on December 23, 1913, by President Woodrow Wilson, who, as you know, was\nborn just down Interstate 81 in Staunton. Work then began to organize the Board of Governors in\nWashington and the 12 Reserve Banks around the country, which opened for business on\nNovember 16, 1914. The founding of the Federal Reserve System 100 years ago was the\nculmination of decades of debate on an array of proposals for banking and currency reform. We\nin the Federal Reserve are taking this opportunity to reflect on our past, both the successes and\nthe “improvement opportunities,” and to make our history more accessible to the public. If\nyou’re interested in learning more, I urge you to visit federalreservehistory.org. 1\nFor most people, the turning of the calendar is an occasion for hope regarding prospects for the\nyear ahead, and economists are no different. Economists’ hopes have been bolstered of late by a\nrecent string of data releases indicating that 2013 ended on a positive note. Second-half growth\nin real GDP ― our broadest measure of overall economic activity ― was stronger than we’ve\nseen in quite some time. While that figure was boosted significantly by inventory accumulation\nthat is unlikely to persist, there was some evidence of momentum that might carry forward.\nConsumer spending, in particular, seems to have surged. That’s notable because growth in\nconsumer spending has averaged just above 2 percent per year for most of this expansion, which\nis a good part of the reason real GDP has only grown at about a 2 percent annual rate.\nMany forecasters are citing the recent surge as support for projections of sustained growth at\naround 3 percent starting later this year. 2 It’s worth pointing out, however, that this has been true\nat virtually every point in this expansion. In other words, ever since the recovery began, most\nforecasters have been expecting the economy to pick up speed in the next couple of quarters with\nthe easing of headwinds that have been temporarily restraining growth. My own forecasts (at\nleast initially) followed this script as well.\nDespite these perennial hopes, the actual results have been more modest. Real GDP grew by 2.0\npercent in 2011, 2.0 percent in 2012 and 1.8 percent for the first half of 2013. This record of\nrelatively steady but modestly paced expansion, despite forecasts of an imminent increase in\ngrowth, helps motivate the more cautious economic outlook that I will share with you today. But\n\n1\n\n\fbefore I begin, I should make clear that the views expressed are my own and should not be\nattributed to others in the Federal Reserve System. 3\nA bit of background helps explain the forecasting disappointments of the last several years.\nBefore the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, we enjoyed a period known as the Great\nModeration. From 1983 to 2007, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent. Over\nthat 24-year period, we experienced only two short, shallow recessions that together lasted just\nfive quarters. Real personal income kept pace with GDP, also growing at a 3.3 percent annual\nrate. And consumer spending advanced even more rapidly than income, growing at a 3.6 percent\nannual rate.\nPart of the reason consumer spending grew more rapidly than income over that period was the\nrise in household wealth. Stock prices, bond prices and housing prices all increased significantly\nduring the Great Moderation. Another reason for the divergence was the increase in credit\navailability for most consumers. For example, the ratio of credit card debt to personal income\nrose from 2.4 percent in 1983 to 8.0 percent in 2007.\nDuring the Great Recession, GDP fell 4.3 percent over a six-quarter interval, but other indicators\ndocument even greater hardship. Payroll employment fell by 8.7 million jobs in the recession and\nits immediate aftermath. The unemployment rate, which was below 5 percent in 2007, rose to 10\npercent in October 2009. Real personal income fell by 3.1 percent from December 2007 to July\n2009. The value of household holdings of stocks and mutual fund shares fell by $5 trillion, and\nthe value of household equity in real estate fell by $3.9 trillion. The scale and scope of the loss in\nincome and wealth experienced by Americans was far greater than anything they had seen in the\nprevious 20 years.\nGiven that experience, lenders are bound to re-evaluate the riskiness associated with extending\ncredit to typical households. Indeed, consumers themselves appear to be re-evaluating the\nriskiness associated with indebtedness, no doubt reflecting a sense that their income and asset\nreturns may be substantially riskier than they had come to believe during the Great Moderation.\nUnder these conditions, it’s no surprise that credit is no longer available on the same terms. And\nit’s no surprise that consumers have been paying off debt and building up savings in order to\nrestore some sense of balance to their household finances.\nThese developments appear to have contributed to a persistent cautiousness in household\nspending. Over the last three years, real consumer spending has increased at an annual rate of 2.1\npercent. Although consumption grew rapidly at the end of last year, we have seen similar surges\nsince the last recession, only to see spending return to a more moderate trend. Consumer\nspending trends are likely to depend on whether the dramatic events of the last few years are\nonly a temporary disturbance to household sentiment or if they instead represent a more\npersistent shift in attitudes about borrowing and saving. At this point, I am inclined toward the\nlatter view.\nBusinesses also appear to be quite reticent to hire and invest. A widely followed index of small\nbusiness optimism fell sharply during the recession and has only partially recovered since then.\nInterestingly, when small business owners were asked in the latest survey about the single most\n2\n\n\fimportant problem they face, 20 percent answered “government regulations and red tape.” This\nobservation accords with reports we’ve been hearing from many business contacts for several\nyears now. They’ve seen a substantial increase in the pace of regulatory change and a substantial\nincrease in uncertainty about the shape of new regulations. Both are said to discourage new\nhiring and investment commitments.\nAdding to the uncertainty is the continuing cloud over our nation’s fiscal policy. The most recent\nround of budget deliberations has certainly been a welcome relief from the recurrent legislative\ncliffhangers of the last several years. The lower odds of an imminent fiscal showdown may ease\nsome business and consumer concerns, and that may aid growth. But overall government\nspending has been declining lately, and, given continuing fiscal pressures, that category is likely\nto make little, if any, contribution to GDP growth in coming years.\nFrom a longer-run perspective, it’s worth noting that current law still implies an unsustainable\npath for federal expenditures and receipts. My fear is that the recent decline in the federal deficit\nwill dampen the sense of urgency about fixing the longer-run budgetary imbalance. The sooner\nwe resolve uncertainty about how the costs of those fixes will be allocated, the better off we will\nbe, I believe. Dealing with the federal budget sooner rather than later would allow us to spread\nthe cost out over time and reduce the ultimate burden. Moreover, it would remove a potentially\nimportant source of uncertainty hanging over investment and spending decisions.\nI’ve discussed consumer spending and business investment, which together account for about\nfour-fifths of the economy. Residential investment is one area in which we have seen strong\ngrowth. Real residential investment increased by more than 15 percent in 2012, and last year it\nincreased by 6.3 percent. Many housing market indicators, such as housing starts and new home\nsales, remain well below levels that were typical during the expansions of the Great Moderation,\nso there is a reasonable basis for expecting residential investment growth to continue. But since\nthis category is only 3 percent of GDP, it has only a marginal effect on the overall outlook.\nThat leaves net exports, which for various reasons also are likely to contribute little to growth\nnext year. Adding up all these categories of spending yields a forecast for GDP growth of just a\nlittle above 2 percent ― not much different from what we’ve seen for the last three years.\nThat’s my forecast for this year, but when thinking about growth prospects, I believe it’s\nimportant to keep an eye on longer-run trends as well. To do that, it’s useful to break down real\nGDP growth into the sum of the growth in labor productivity ― that is, output per worker ― and\nthe growth in the number of workers. It turns out both of these components have slowed since\nthe Great Moderation. If growth in overall output is going to rise substantially, then we would\nneed to see an increase in labor productivity growth, or in employment growth, or both.\nLet’s start with productivity. Broadly speaking, growth in labor productivity results from\napplying additional capital goods to the production process or by changing the way production is\norganized in order to improve the efficiency of input use. Gains in labor productivity represent\nthe ultimate source of gains in real family incomes over time. From 1983 to 2000, labor\nproductivity grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate. But toward the end of the Great Moderation,\n\n3\n\n\fproductivity growth slowed, and over the last three years productivity has increased at a very\nmodest annual rate of about 1 percent.\nForecasting trends in productivity growth is exceedingly difficult because innovations are hard to\nforesee. Having said that, it’s not clear why productivity growth would improve dramatically in\nthe near term; there’s no sign of a major surge of technical innovations in the pipeline or\nsignificant improvement in educational attainment or substantial deregulation ― the kinds of\ndevelopments that would lead to a major acceleration in productivity. But it’s also hard to\nbelieve productivity has hit some sort of plateau. It doesn’t take much digging to find examples\nof continued innovation in today’s economy, even if they haven’t generated the rapid aggregate\nproductivity growth we saw during the Great Moderation. In my view, the productivity trend of\nthe last several years provides the best basis for near-term projections, and thus my outlook is\nthat productivity growth will be about 1 percent for the next few years.\nEmployment growth also has slowed since the Great Moderation. From 1983 to 2000,\nemployment increased at a 1.8 percent annual rate (as estimated in the survey of households).\nOver the last four years, employment growth has been just 1.2 percent per year ― so\nemployment growth has fallen by about a third. One reason is that the size of the working age\npopulation is now growing more slowly than before. Moreover, the fraction of the working age\npopulation that is employed or looking for work ― economists call this the labor force\nparticipation rate ― has been declining due to demographic shifts and other structural factors. In\naddition, I’ve been struck by the large number of accounts I’ve heard of firms having difficulty\nfinding workers with the appropriate skills, in many cases constraining production. It appears as\nif the nature of current technological advances may be shifting the mix of requisite workforce\nskills more rapidly than in the past, which would impede the rate at which unemployed workers\ncan be drawn back into employment. So there are a number of reasons to doubt that employment\ngrowth will return soon to the strong pace we saw during the Great Moderation.\nBefore I wrap things up, I’d like to share some brief observations on inflation and monetary\npolicy. First, it’s important to recognize that inflation has been well-behaved over the last 20\nyears. Since 1993, inflation has averaged 1.9 percent, which is remarkably close to the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s goal of 2 percent. Second, we’ve seen some fluctuations in inflation\nover that time period, but they have all proven to be transitory. For example, inflation averaged\n2.8 percent over the three years ending in December 2007. I mention this because many people\nhave noticed that inflation has been running well below the Committee’s goal. My sense is that\ninflation will move back toward 2 percent over the next year or two, in part because measures of\nexpected inflation remain well-contained. This is not a certainty, however, and I believe the\nFOMC will want to watch this closely.\nAnd that brings us to monetary policy, which has been particularly interesting of late. As you\nmay recall, the Fed reduced its target for the federal funds rate to essentially zero at the end of\n2008. Given the state of the economy, that was the appropriate monetary policy response. Since\nthen, the Fed has purchased a significant quantity of assets, which increases the supply of\nmonetary assets to the banking system and in some circumstances can have a stimulative effect.\nThe size of our balance sheet has gone from under $1 trillion before the recession to around $4\ntrillion, and last year was increasing by about $85 billion per month.\n4\n\n\fWhen the FOMC met in December, it decided to reduce the pace of asset purchases from $85\nbillion per month to $75 billion per month. At the Committee’s meeting last week, the pace of\npurchases was further reduced to $65 billion per month. I supported both decisions because they\nare consistent with the linkage the Committee established between the asset purchase program\nand the outlook for labor market conditions. Since the program began in late 2012, we’ve seen a\nsubstantial improvement in a variety of indicators of labor market conditions, including the\nunemployment rate and the level of employment. So it made sense to initiate the process of\nbringing the program to a close. I expect to see further reductions in the pace of purchases at\nupcoming meetings.\nIn conclusion, I’d like to return to the theme with which I began. The pickup in growth late last\nyear is certainly a welcome development, and it may well be a harbinger of stronger growth\nahead. But experience with similar growth spurts in the recent past suggests that it is too soon to\nmake that call. My suspicion is that we will see growth subside this year to closer to 2 percent,\nabout the rate we’ve seen since the Great Recession. Growth has been disappointing relative to\nour experience during the period of the Great Moderation, and growth may continue at a rate that\nis slower than in the past. But our economy is by no means stagnating; productivity is rising,\nincomes are growing and innovation is occurring. Our institutions of higher learning are\nworldwide leaders in research and education, and they continue to attract exceptional students\nfrom abroad. Our markets remain flexible and resilient. The public policy problems we face may\nbe difficult, but they are certainly not insoluble. Consequently, I believe, a broad perspective\nsuggests a fundamentally optimistic view of our future.\n1\n\nFor more on the Fed’s history, see Jeffrey M.

Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nGreater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce\n2014 Economic Forecast\nRaleigh, North Carolina\n\nIt's a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the economic outlook for the year ahead. This year\nis a special one for the Federal Reserve — our centennial year. President Woodrow Wilson\nsigned the Federal Reserve Act on December 23, 1913. Work then began to organize the Board\nof Governors in Washington and the 12 Reserve Banks around the country, which opened for\nbusiness on November 16, 1914. The founding of the Federal Reserve System 100 years ago was\nthe culmination of decades of debate on an array of proposals for banking and currency reform.\nWe in the Federal Reserve are taking this opportunity to reflect on our past, both the successes\nand the “improvement opportunities,” and to make our history more accessible to the public. If\nyou're interested in learning more, I urge you to visit federalreservehistory.org. 1\nFor most people, the turning of the calendar is an occasion for hope regarding prospects for the\nyear ahead, and economists are no different. Economists' hopes have been bolstered of late by a\nrecent string of data releases indicating that 2013 ended on a positive note. Third-quarter growth\nin real GDP — our broadest measure of overall economic activity — was stronger than we've\nseen in quite some time. While that figure was boosted significantly by inventory accumulation\nthat is unlikely to persist, there was some evidence of momentum that might carry forward into\nthe fourth quarter. Consumer spending, in particular, seems to have surged. That's notable\nbecause growth in consumer spending has averaged just above 2 percent per year for most of this\nexpansion, which is a good part of the reason real GDP has only grown at about a 2 percent\nannual rate.\nMany forecasters are citing the recent surge as support for projections of sustained growth at\naround 3 percent starting later this year. 2 It's worth pointing out, however, that this has been true\nat virtually every point in this expansion. That is, since the recovery began, most forecasters have\nbeen expecting the economy to pick up speed in the next couple of quarters with the easing of\nheadwinds that have been temporarily restraining growth. My own forecasts (at least initially)\nfollowed this script as well.\nDespite these perennial hopes, the actual results have been more modest. Real GDP grew by 2.0\npercent in 2011, 2.0 percent in 2012 and 1.8 percent for the first half of 2013. This record of\nrelatively steady but modestly paced expansion, despite forecasts of an imminent increase in\ngrowth, helps motivate the more cautious economic outlook that I will share with you today. But\nbefore I begin, I should make clear that the views expressed are my own and should not be\nattributed to others in the Federal Reserve System. 3\n1\n\n\fA bit of background helps explain the forecasting disappointments of the last several years.\nBefore the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, we enjoyed a period known as the Great\nModeration. From 1983 to 2007, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent. Over\nthat 24-year period, we experienced only two short, shallow recessions that together lasted just\nfive quarters. Real personal income kept pace with GDP, also growing at a 3.3 percent annual\nrate. And consumer spending advanced even more rapidly than income, growing at a 3.6 percent\nannual rate.\nPart of the reason consumer spending was able to grow more rapidly than income over that\nperiod was the rise in household wealth. Stock prices, bond prices and housing prices all\nincreased significantly during the Great Moderation. Another reason for the divergence was the\nincrease in credit availability for most consumers. For example, the ratio of credit card debt to\npersonal income rose from 2.4 percent in 1983 to 8.0 percent in 2007.*\nDuring the Great Recession, GDP fell by 4.3 percent over a six-quarter interval, but other\nindicators document even greater hardship. Payroll employment fell by 8.7 million jobs in the\nrecession and its immediate aftermath. The unemployment rate, which was below 5 percent in\n2007, rose to 10 percent in October 2009. Real personal income fell by 3.1 percent from\nDecember 2007 to July 2009. The value of household holdings of stocks and mutual fund shares\nfell by $5 trillion, and the value of household equity in real estate fell by $3.9 trillion. The scale\nand scope of the loss in income and wealth experienced by Americans was far greater than\nanything they had seen in the previous 20 years.\nGiven that experience, lenders are bound to re-evaluate the riskiness associated with extending\ncredit to a typical household. Indeed, consumers themselves appear to be re-evaluating the\nriskiness associated with indebtedness, no doubt reflecting a sense that their income and asset\nreturns may be substantially riskier than they had come to believe during the Great Moderation.\nUnder these conditions, it's no surprise that credit is no longer available on the same terms. And\nit's no surprise that consumers have been paying off debt and building up savings in order to\nrestore some sense of balance to their household finances.\nThese developments appear to have contributed to a persistent cautiousness in household\nspending behavior. Over the last three years, real consumer spending has increased at an annual\nrate of 2.25 percent. Although consumption grew rapidly at the end of last year, we have seen\nsimilar surges since the last recession, only to see spending return to a more moderate trend.\nConsumer spending trends are likely to depend on whether the dramatic events of the last few\nyears are only a temporary disturbance to household sentiment or if they instead represent a more\npersistent shift in attitudes about borrowing and saving. At this point, I am inclined toward the\nlatter view.\nBusinesses also appear to be quite reticent to hire and invest. A widely followed index of small\nbusiness optimism fell sharply during the recession and has only partially recovered since then.\nInterestingly, when small business owners were asked about the single most important problem\nthey face, the most frequent answer in the latest survey was “government regulations and red\ntape.” This observation accords with reports we've been hearing from many business contacts for\n2\n\n\fseveral years now. They've seen a substantial increase in the pace of regulatory change and a\nsubstantial increase in uncertainty about the shape of new regulations. Both are said to\ndiscourage new hiring and investment commitments.\nAdding to the uncertainty is the continuing cloud over our nation's fiscal policy. The most recent\nround of budget deliberations has certainly been a welcome relief from the recurrent legislative\ncliffhangers of the last several years. The lower odds of an imminent budget showdown may ease\nsome business and consumer concerns, and that may aid growth. But overall government\nspending has been declining lately, and, given continuing fiscal pressures, that category is likely\nto make little, if any, contribution to GDP growth in coming years.\nFrom a longer-run perspective, it's worth noting that current law still implies an unsustainable\npath for federal expenditures and receipts. My fear is that the recent decline in the federal deficit\nwill dampen the sense of urgency about fixing the longer-run budgetary imbalance. The sooner\nwe resolve uncertainty about how the costs of those fixes will be allocated, the better off we will\nbe, I believe. Dealing with the federal budget sooner rather than later would allow spreading the\ncost out over time, which would reduce the ultimate burden. Moreover, it would remove a\npotentially important source of uncertainty hanging over investment and spending decisions.\nI've discussed consumer spending and business investment, which together account for about\nfour-fifths of the economy. Residential investment is one area in which we have seen strong\ngrowth. Real residential investment increased by more than 15 percent in 2012, and through the\nthird quarter of last year it increased at a 12 percent annual rate. Many housing market indicators,\nsuch as housing starts and new home sales, remain well below levels that were typical during the\nexpansions of the Great Moderation, so there is a reasonable basis to expect residential\ninvestment to continue to grow. But since this category is only 3 percent of GDP, it has only a\nmarginal effect on the overall outlook.\nThat leaves net exports, which for various reasons also are likely to make little contribution to\ngrowth next year. Adding up all these categories of spending yields a forecast for GDP growth of\njust a little above 2 percent — not much different from what we've seen for the last three years.\nThat's my forecast for this year, but when thinking about growth prospects, I believe it's\nimportant to keep an eye on longer-run trends as well. To do that, it's useful to break down real\nGDP growth into the sum of the growth in labor productivity — that is, output per worker — and\nthe growth in the number of workers. It turns out both of these components have slowed since\nthe Great Moderation. If growth in overall output is going to rise substantially, then we would\nneed to see an increase in labor productivity growth, or in employment growth, or both.\nLet's start with productivity. Broadly speaking, growth in labor productivity results from\napplying additional capital goods to the production process or by changing the way production is\norganized in order to improve the efficiency of input use. Gains in labor productivity represent\nthe ultimate source of gains in real family incomes over time. From 1983 to 2000, labor\nproductivity grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate. But toward the end of the Great Moderation,\nproductivity growth slowed, and over the last three years productivity has increased at a very\nmodest 1.0 percent annual rate.\n3\n\n\fForecasting trends in productivity growth is exceedingly difficult because innovations are hard to\nforesee. Having said that, it's not clear why productivity growth would improve dramatically in\nthe near term; there's no sign of a major surge of technical innovations in the pipeline, or\nsignificant improvement in educational attainment or substantial deregulation — the kinds of\ndevelopments that would lead to a major acceleration in productivity. But it's also hard to believe\nproductivity has hit some sort of plateau. It doesn't take much digging to find examples of\ncontinued innovation in today's economy, even if they haven't generated the rapid aggregate\nproductivity growth we saw during the Great Moderation. In my view, the productivity trend of\nthe last several years provides the best basis for near-term projections, and thus my outlook is\nthat productivity growth will be about 1 percent for the next few years.\nEmployment growth also has slowed since the Great Moderation. From 1983 to 2000,\nemployment increased at a 1.8 percent annual rate (as estimated in the survey of households).\nOver the last four years, employment growth has been just 1.0 percent per year — so\nemployment growth has fallen by almost half as well. One reason is that the size of the working\nage population is now growing more slowly than before. Moreover, the fraction of the working\nage population that is employed or looking for work — economists call this the labor force\nparticipation rate — has been declining due to demographic shifts and other structural factors. In\naddition, I've been struck by the large number of accounts I've heard of firms having difficulty\nfinding workers with the appropriate skills, in many cases constraining production. It appears as\nif the nature of current technological advances may be shifting the mix of requisite workforce\nskills more rapidly than in the past, which would impede the rate at which unemployed workers\ncan be drawn back into employment. So there are a number of reasons to doubt that employment\ngrowth will return soon to the strong pace we saw during the Great Moderation.\nBefore I wrap things up, I'd like to share some brief observations on inflation and monetary\npolicy. First, it's important to recognize that inflation has been well-behaved over the last 20\nyears. Since 1993, inflation has averaged 1.9 percent, which is remarkably close to the Federal\nOpen Market Committee's goal of 2 percent. Second, we've seen some fluctuations in inflation\nover that time period, but they have all proven to be transitory. For example, inflation averaged\n2.8 percent over the three years ending in December 2007. I mention this because many people\nhave noticed that over the last 12 months inflation has only averaged 0.9 percent. My sense is\nthat inflation will move back toward 2 percent over the next year or two, in part because\nmeasures of expected inflation remain well contained. This is not a certainty, however, and I\nbelieve the FOMC will want to watch this closely.\nAnd that brings us to monetary policy, which has been particularly interesting of late. As you\nmay recall, the Fed reduced its target for the federal funds rate to essentially zero at the end of\n2008. Given the state of the economy, that was the appropriate monetary policy response. Since\nthen, the Fed has purchased a significant quantity of assets, which increases the supply of\nmonetary assets to the banking system and in some circumstances can have a stimulative effect.\nThe size of our balance sheet has gone from under $1 trillion before the recession to around $4.0\ntrillion, and it has been increasing by about $85 billion per month.\n\n4\n\n\fWhen the FOMC met in December, it decided to reduce the pace of asset purchases from $85\nbillion per month to $75 billion per month. I supported this decision because it was consistent\nwith the linkage the Committee established between the asset purchase program and the outlook\nfor labor market conditions. Since the program began in late 2012, we've seen a substantial\nimprovement in a variety of indicators of labor market conditions, including the unemployment\nrate and the level of employment. So it made sense to initiate the process of bringing the program\nto a close. I expect further reductions in the pace of purchases to be under consideration at\nupcoming meetings.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to return to the theme with which I began. The pickup in growth late last\nyear is certainly a welcome development, and it may well be a harbinger of stronger growth\nahead. But experience with similar growth spurts in the recent past suggests that it is too soon to\nmake that call. My suspicion is that we will see growth subside this year to closer to 2 percent,\nabout the rate we've seen since the Great Recession. Growth has been disappointing relative to\nour experience during the period of the Great Moderation, and growth may continue at a rate that\nis slower than in the past.

Since\nthen, the Fed has purchased a significant quantity of assets, which increases the supply of\nmonetary assets to the banking system and in some circumstances can have a stimulative effect.\n\n4\n\n\fThe size of our balance sheet has gone from $2.2 trillion to around $4.0 trillion, and it has been\nincreasing by about $85 billion per month.\nWhen the FOMC met in December, it decided to reduce the pace of asset purchases from $85\nbillion per month to $75 billion per month. I supported this decision because it was consistent\nwith the linkage the Committee established between the asset purchase program and the outlook\nfor labor market conditions. Since the program began in late 2012, we've seen a substantial\nimprovement in a variety of indicators of labor market conditions, including the unemployment\nrate and the level of employment. So it made sense to initiate the process of bringing the program\nto a close. I expect further reductions in the pace of purchases to be under consideration at\nupcoming meetings.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to return to the theme with which I began. The pickup in growth late last\nyear is certainly a welcome development, and it may well be a harbinger of stronger growth\nahead. But experience with similar growth spurts in the recent past suggests that it is too soon to\nmake that call. My suspicion is that we will see growth subside this year to closer to 2 percent,\nabout the rate we've seen since the Great Recession. Growth has been disappointing relative to\nour experience during the period of the Great Moderation, and growth may continue at a rate that\nis slower than in the past. But our economy is by no means stagnating; productivity is rising,\nincomes are growing and innovation is occurring. Our institutions of higher learning are\nworldwide leaders in research and education, and they continue to attract exceptional students\nfrom abroad. Our markets remain flexible and resilient. The public policy problems we face may\nbe difficult, but they are certainly not insoluble. Consequently, a broad perspective suggests a\nfundamentally optimistic view about our future.\n*An earlier version of this speech incorrectly stated the ratio of credit card debt to personal\nincome in 2007 as 5.5 percent.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, December 2013\nDecember 9, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharlotte Chamber of Commerce Economic Outlook Conference\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the economic outlook. For several years now, ever\nsince the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, most forecasts of overall economic activity have\nfollowed a common script. They essentially have said that while growth has been modest\nrecently, the economy is likely to pick up speed in the next couple of quarters with the easing of\nheadwinds that have been temporarily restraining growth. My own forecasts have followed this\nscript (at least initially), as have those of a broad range of forecasters. Despite these optimistic\nforecasts, the reality has been more modest. Real GDP ― our broadest measure of overall\neconomic activity ― grew by 2.0 percent in 2011, 2.0 percent in 2012, and it looks like GDP\ngrowth this year will again be about 2.0 percent. Many forecasters are sticking to their scripts.\nThe latest Blue Chip compilation of economists’ projections, for example, calls for 2.8 percent\ngrowth in real GDP next year. As you may have guessed, I will share a different view in my\nremarks today. But before I begin, I should make clear that the views expressed are my own and\nshould not be attributed to any other person in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nA growing number of economists have taken on board the disappointing forecasting record of the\nlast few years and have come to believe that growth is more likely than not to remain low over\nthe next few years. A bit of background helps explain the forecasting disappointments of the last\nseveral years: Before the Great Recession, we came to enjoy a period known as the Great\nModeration. From 1983 to 2007, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent. Over\nthat 24-year period, we experienced only two short, shallow recessions that together lasted only\nfive quarters. Real personal income kept pace with GDP, also growing at a 3.3 percent annual\nrate. And consumer spending advanced even more rapidly than income, growing at a 3.6 percent\nannual rate. Part of the reason consumer spending was able to grow more rapidly than income\nover that period was the rise in household wealth. Stock prices, bond prices and housing prices\nall increased significantly during the Great Moderation.\nDuring the Great Recession, GDP fell by 4.3 percent and payroll employment fell by 8.7 million\njobs. The scale and scope of loss of income and wealth experienced by American consumers was\nfar greater than anything seen in the previous 20 years.\n\n1\n\n\fGiven that experience, both households and lenders were bound to re-evaluate the riskiness\nassociated with indebtedness, reflecting a sense that income and asset returns would be\nsubstantially less certain than they had come to believe during the Great Moderation. Under\nthese conditions, it’s no surprise that credit is no longer available to consumers on the same\nterms. And it’s no surprise that consumers have been paying off debt and building up savings in\norder to restore some sense of balance to their household finances.\nThese developments appear to have led to a persistent cautiousness in household spending\nbehavior. Over the last three years, real consumer spending has increased at an annual rate of 2.0\npercent. Given the traumatic events of the past few years, it seems quite likely that consumer\ncaution is not a temporary headwind.\nBusinesses also appear to be quite reticent to hire and invest. A widely followed index of small\nbusiness optimism fell sharply during the recession and has only partially recovered since then.\nInterestingly, when asked about the single most important problem they face, the most frequent\nanswer in the latest survey was “government regulations and red tape.” This result accords with\nreports that we’ve been hearing from business contacts for several years now. There has been a\nsubstantial increase in the pace of regulatory change, and a substantial increase in uncertainty\nabout the exact shape of anticipated new regulations. That uncertainty provides an additional\nreason for firms to postpone expansion plans. The disorderly implementation of the Affordable\nCare Act is also likely to be dampening businesses’ willingness to expand.\nAdding to the uncertainty is the ongoing fiscal drama in Washington. Even with last January’s\ntax increases and with the sequester holding down federal spending, the deficit was about 4\npercent of GDP for the 2013 fiscal year. That level is unsustainably high over the long run.\nMoreover, if you take into account the rising costs of medical entitlements and Social Security,\nit’s clear that current federal budget plans are unsustainable over the long run. So at some point\nwe will see a combination of reduced federal spending growth, higher taxes or both. In the\nmeantime, businesses and households will be unsure about how their tax liabilities will evolve\nover time, and firms doing business with the federal government will be uncertain about their\nprospects as well. Although it’s hard to quantify, I believe this budget uncertainty is also\nweighing on business hiring and investment decisions.\nSo far I’ve mentioned consumer spending and business investment, which together account for\nabout four-fifths of the economy. Residential investment is one area in which we have seen\nstrong growth. Last year, real residential investment increased by more than 15 percent, and so\nfar this year it has increased at a 13 percent annual rate. Despite that, however, housing market\nindicators, such as housing starts and new home sales, remain well below levels that might be\nconsidered normal, so there seems to be room for residential investment to continue to grow. But\nsince this is only 3 percent of GDP, it has only a marginal effect on the overall outlook.\nOverall government spending has been weak recently, and, given continuing fiscal pressures,\nthat category is likely to make little, if any, contribution to GDP growth next year. That leaves\nnet exports, which for various reasons are also likely to make little contribution to GDP growth\nnext year. Adding up all these categories of spending yields a forecast for GDP growth next year\n\n2\n\n\fof just a little above 2 percent ― not much different from what we’ve seen for the last three\nyears.\nThat’s my forecast for next year, but when thinking about growth prospects, I believe it’s\nimportant to keep an eye on longer-run trends as well. To do that, it’s useful to break down real\nGDP growth into the sum of the growth in productivity ― that is, output per worker ― and the\ngrowth in the number of workers. It turns out both of these components have slowed since the\nGreat Moderation.\nStarting first with productivity: From 1983 to 2000, productivity grew at a 1.8 percent annual\nrate. But toward the end of the Great Moderation, productivity growth slowed, and over the last\nthree years, productivity has increased at a very modest 1.0 percent annual rate. Forecasting\ntrends in productivity growth is exceedingly difficult. Having said that, it’s hard to see why\nproductivity growth would improve dramatically in the near term; there’s no sign of a major\nsurge of technical innovation in the pipeline, significant educational improvement or substantial\nderegulation ― the kind of developments that would lead to a major acceleration in productivity.\nBy the same token, it’s hard to believe productivity has hit some sort of plateau. It doesn’t take\nmuch digging to find examples of continued innovation in today’s economy, even if it hasn’t\ngenerated the rapid aggregate productivity growth we saw during the Great Moderation. The\nmost likely outcome, in my view, is more of the same, and thus my outlook is that productivity\ngrowth will be about 1 percent for a considerable period.\nEmployment growth also has slowed since the Great Moderation. From 1983 to 2000,\nemployment increased at a 1.8 percent annual rate (as estimated in the survey of households).\nOver the last four years, employment growth has been just 1.0 percent per year ― so\nemployment growth has fallen by almost half. An imminent acceleration in employment does not\nseem likely to me. Population growth is lower now than before. Moreover, the fraction of the\nworking age population that is employed or looking for work ― economists call this the labor\nforce participation rate ― has been declining due to demographic shifts and other structural\nfactors. Also, I’ve been struck by the large number of accounts I’ve heard recently about firms\nhaving difficulty finding workers with the appropriate skills, in many cases constraining\nproduction. It appears as if the nature of current technological advances may be shifting the mix\nof requisite workforce skills more rapidly than in the past.\nBefore I wrap things up, I’d like to make some brief observations on inflation and monetary\npolicy. First, it’s important to recognize that inflation has been well-behaved over the last 20\nyears. Since 1993, inflation has averaged 1.9 percent, which is remarkably close to the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s goal of 2 percent. Second, we’ve seen some fluctuations in inflation\nover that time period, but they have all proven to be transitory. For example, inflation averaged\n2.8 percent over the three years ending in December 2007. I mention this because many people\nhave noticed that over the last 12 months inflation has only averaged 0.7 percent. My sense is\nthat inflation will move back toward 2 percent over the next year or two, in part because\nmeasures of expected inflation remain well contained. This is not a certainty, however, and I\nbelieve the FOMC will want to watch this closely.\n\n3\n\n\fAnd that brings us to monetary policy, which has been particularly challenging of late. As you\nmay recall, the Fed reduced its target for the federal funds rate to essentially zero at the end of\n2008. Given the state of the economy, that was the appropriate monetary policy response. Since\nthen, the Fed has purchased a significant quantity of assets, which increases the supply of\nmonetary assets to the banking system and in some circumstances can have a stimulative effect.\nThe size of our balance sheet has gone from $2.2 trillion to around $4.0 trillion, and it continues\nto increase by about $85 billion per month.\nWhen the FOMC meets next week, I expect discussion about the possibility of reducing the pace\nof asset purchases. The key issue, in my view, is the extent to which the benefits of further\nmonetary stimulus are likely to outweigh the costs. Economic growth trends currently appear to\nbe driven mainly by population growth and productivity growth, in which case monetary\nstimulus will only have limited and transitory effects. But further stimulus does increase the size\nof our balance sheet and correspondingly increases the risks associated with the “exit process”\nwhen it becomes time to withdraw stimulus. This is why I have not been a supporter of the\ncurrent asset purchase program.\nIn conclusion, I’d like to return to the theme with which I began. Yes, 2 percent growth is\ndisappointing relative to our experience during the period of the Great Moderation, and yes,\ngrowth may continue at a rate that is slower than in the past. But productivity is rising, incomes\nare growing and innovation is occurring. Our institutions of higher learning are worldwide\nleaders in research and education, and they continue to attract exceptional students from abroad.\nOur markets remain flexible and resilient. The public policy problems we face may be difficult,\nbut they are certainly not insoluble. Consequently, a broad perspective suggests a fundamentally\noptimistic view about our future.\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roy Webb for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n4\n\n\f",

            "content": "Statement\nSubcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law\nof the Committee on the Judiciary\n\nDecember 3, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThe Committee on the Judiciary\nRayburn House Office Building\nWashington, D.C.\n\nGood morning. I am honored to speak to the Subcommittee about the bankruptcy code and\nfinancial institution insolvency. In my remarks, I will discuss why I believe it’s so important to\nimprove our bankruptcy code to make it feasible to resolve failing financial firms in bankruptcy.\nAt the outset, I should say that my comments today are my own views and do not necessarily\nreflect those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or my colleagues at other Federal\nReserve Banks. My views have been informed by both my experience leading the Fifth Federal\nReserve District over the last seven years and as a research economist studying banking policy\nfor the prior 25 years.\nThe events of 2008 provided evidence, in my view, of glaring deficiencies in the way financial\ninstitution distress and insolvency are handled, particularly at large institutions. 1 The problem ―\nwidely known as “too big to fail” ― consists of two mutually reinforcing expectations. First,\nmany financial institution creditors feel protected by an implicit government commitment of\nsupport should the institution face financial distress. This belief dampens creditors’ attention to\nrisk and makes debt financing artificially cheap for borrowing firms, leading to excessive\nleverage. Moreover, it leads to overuse of types of borrowing — such as short-term wholesale\nfunding — that are more fragile and more likely to prompt the need for such protection. Second,\npolicymakers may well worry that if a large financial firm with a high reliance on short-term\nfunding were to file for bankruptcy under the U.S. bankruptcy code, it would result in\nundesirable effects on counterparties, financial markets and economic activity. This expectation\ninduces policymakers to intervene in ways that allow short-term creditors to escape losses, such\nas through central bank lending or public sector capital injections. This reinforces creditors’\nexpectations of support and firms’ incentives to grow large and rely on short-term funding,\nresulting in more financial fragility and more rescues.\nExpectations of creditor rescues have increased over the last four decades through the gradual\naccretion of precedents. Research at the Richmond Fed has estimated that one-third of the\nfinancial sector’s liabilities are perceived to benefit from implicit protection, based on actual\ngovernment actions and policy statements. 2 Adding implicit protection to explicit protection\n1\n\n\fprograms such as deposit insurance, we found that 57 percent of financial sector liabilities were\nexpected to benefit from government guarantees as of the end of 2011. This figure was about 45\npercent at the end of 1999.\nIn response to the experience of 2008, Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act laid out a planning process\nfor the resolution of failed financial institutions. A resolution plan, or “living will,” is a\ndescription of a firm’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. bankruptcy code,\nwithout government assistance, in the event of material financial distress or failure. Among other\nthings, it spells out the firm’s organizational structure, key management information systems,\ncritical operations and a mapping of the relationship between core business lines and legal\nentities. The heart of the plan is the specification of the actions the firm would take to facilitate\nrapid and orderly resolution and prevent adverse effects of failure, including the firm’s strategy\nto maintain critical operations and funding. 3\nThe Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can jointly determine that a\nplan is “not credible” or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code, in\nwhich case the firm would be required to submit a revised plan to address identified deficiencies.\nA resubmission could include plans to change the business operations and corporate structure in\norder to eliminate deficiencies. If the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan\ndoes not remedy identified deficiencies, they can require more capital, increase liquidity\nrequirements or restrict the growth, activities or operations of the firm. In essence, regulators can\norder changes in the structure and operations of a firm to make it resolvable in bankruptcy\nwithout government assistance.\nIf there is a determination that, among other things, the firm’s failure under the U.S. bankruptcy\ncode would have serious adverse effects on “U.S. financial stability,” Title II of the Dodd-Frank\nAct gives the FDIC the ability, with the agreement of other financial regulators, to take a firm\ninto receivership. One difference between a Title II receivership and the bankruptcy code is that\nTitle II gives the FDIC the ability to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury (specifically, the\nOrderly Liquidation Fund at the Treasury) to make payments to creditors of the failed firm or to\nguarantee the liabilities of the failed firm. 4 The funds are to be repaid from recoveries on the\nassets of the failed firm or from assessments against the largest, most complex financial\ncompanies.\nWhile the FDIC is to pay creditors no less than they would have received in a liquidation of the\nfirm, the Act provides the FDIC with broad discretion to treat similarly situated creditors\ndifferently. 5 This can encourage short-term creditors to believe they would benefit from such\ntreatment and therefore continue to pay insufficient attention to risk and invest in fragile funding\narrangements. Given widespread expectations of support for financially distressed institutions in\norderly liquidations, regulators will likely feel forced to provide support to these short-term\ncreditors to avoid the turbulence of disappointing expectations. This would replicate the two\nmutually reinforcing expectations that define “too big to fail.”\nClearly, the Dodd-Frank Act envisions bankruptcy without government support as the first and\nmost preferable option in the case of a failing financial institution, and for good reason, in my\nview. If resolution in bankruptcy without the expectation of implicit government guarantees\n2\n\n\fcomes to be expected as the norm, the incentives of market participants would be better aligned\nwith our public policy goal of a financial system that effectively allocates capital and risks. Large\nfinancial firms themselves would want to be less leveraged and less reliant on unstable shortterm funding. Institutions and markets would, accordingly, be more resilient in response to\nfinancial stress, and policymakers could credibly commit to forgo the creditor rescues that do so\nmuch damage to incentives.\nThe alternative to robust plans for resolution in bankruptcy is to institutionalize the capacity to\nprovide public sector rescues for financial firm creditors outside of bankruptcy, through Title II.\nThis would be a far less desirable path, I believe. Trying to correct these incentive distortions\nthrough the regulation of firm size, structure and capital is likely to fall short. This path thus\nwould fundamentally undermine the incentives of financial institutions and their creditors to plan\neffectively for Title I resolution. And it would continue to tilt financial innovation toward\nbypassing regulatory constraints and relying on the fragile short-term funding methods that are\nmost likely to elicit government protection. The result would be ever-increasing regulatory costs\nand repeated bouts of financial instability.\nReducing the probability that a large financial firm becomes financially distressed ― through\nenhanced standards for capital and liquidity, for example ― is useful, but will never be enough.\nThe path toward a stable financial system requires that policymakers have confidence in the\nunassisted failure of financial firms under the U.S bankruptcy code and that investors are thereby\nconvinced that unassisted bankruptcy is the norm. This is why I believe it is vitally important to\nensure our bankruptcy laws are well crafted to apply to large financial institutions.\nIn evaluating alternative approaches to insolvency and bankruptcy provisions, it would be a\nmistake to assume that the behaviors of financial firms and their creditors will remain\nunchanged. For example, I have stressed that the heavy reliance of large financial institutions on\nwholesale funding markets evolved under the growing expectation of public sector rescues, and\nis likely to depend sensitively on that expectation. In the absence of that expectation, firms and\ntheir creditors would have strong incentives to reduce reliance on fragile short-term funding.\nThis is relevant to the frequently heard claim that the large “liquidity needs” of failing financial\ninstitutions is a stumbling block to resolving such firms in bankruptcy. The U.S. bankruptcy code\nallows the bankrupt firm to obtain, subject to court approval, “debtor-in-possession,” or DIP,\nfinancing that is generally senior to pre-existing creditors. Such financing can be useful to fund\nongoing operations — for example, to pay off certain creditors, such as vendors, rather than\nretain them in bankruptcy proceedings. Other creditors often find it advantageous to approve DIP\nfunding, despite the dilution of their own claims, because it ensures the continuation of ongoing\noperations.\nThe point is that if repayment of short-term obligations in bankruptcy depends on large amounts\nof DIP financing that would be difficult for a financial institution to obtain, one would expect to\nsee less reliance on short-term credit (at least as long as government-provided DIP financing was\nnot expected to fill the gap). Moreover, an inability to fund necessary operations in bankruptcy is\nlikely to compromise the credibility of a Title I resolution plan. In this case, regulators would be\nwarranted to require less reliance on short-term funding in the first place.\n3\n\n\fThe FDIC’s authority to lend to distressed institutions under its Orderly Liquidation Authority\namounts to government-provided DIP financing. The beneficial feature of privately provided\nDIP financing is the presumption that, because it’s provided by market participants and approved\nby creditors and the court, it’s fairly priced and thus unsubsidized and does not unduly\ndisadvantage any particular class of creditors. Indeed, this is why unassisted bankruptcy is so\ncritical to ending “too big to fail” and why firms were instructed not to assume extraordinary\ngovernment support in their submitted resolution plans. Public sector support can be underpriced\nand distortionary, and can reallocate returns between creditor classes outside the procedural\nsafeguards of bankruptcy. Discretionary government provision of DIP financing would\nundermine the integrity and purpose of the bankruptcy code.\nSome recent proposals to address the “too big to fail” problem would make structural changes to\nfinancial firms ― imposing quantitative limits on their size or prohibiting certain risky activities.\nI am open to the notion that such restrictions may ultimately be necessary to achieve a more\nstable financial system, but I do not believe we have a strong basis yet for determining exactly\nwhat activity and size limits should be adopted. The living will process, however, should provide\nan objective basis for decisions about how the structure, financing or activities of large financial\nfirms need to be altered in order to assure orderly unassisted resolution. In addition, the process\nof writing credible living wills should illuminate efforts to identify ways in which the bankruptcy\ncode could be improved to make the resolution of financial firms more orderly. 6\nRobust and credible resolution plans will position us to wind down the Orderly Liquidation\nAuthority and other financing mechanisms, such as the Federal Reserve’s remaining 13(3)\npowers to lend in “unusual and exigent circumstances.” By allowing creditors to escape losses,\nsuch lending distorts incentives and exacerbates moral hazard. Eliminating the ability to provide\nad hoc support to firms in financial distress would cement our commitment to orderly unassisted\nresolutions in bankruptcy, thereby contributing to a more stable and competitive playing field.\n\n1\n\nThe inherent problems have been widely noted by economists going back decades before the crisis.

It's a special pleasure to visit\nwith my old friend, Jim Culberson. Those of you who know Jim, and I suspect that's right many\nof you, probably know him best as an outstanding local banker, and as the former chairman of\nthe American Bankers Association in Washington, the foremost trade organization in the\nbanking industry. Jim also served on the board of directors of our Charlotte branch, and he then\nwent on to serve on the board of our head office in Richmond. We at the Richmond Fed greatly\nappreciate his service to the country in these roles. And I can assure you that public service was\nJim's constant focus, because he took very seriously the proposition that the purpose of the\nbanking system is to meet public needs. So thank you, Jim, for your service, and thank you for\ninviting me down to Asheboro.\nI will be talking today about the outlook for the economy, but before I do, I should make clear\nthat the views expressed are my own and should not be attributed to any other person in the\nFederal Reserve System. 1\nLet's start with a little background. For several years now, ever since the Great Recession of\n2008 and 2009, most forecasts of overall economic activity have followed a common script.\nThey essentially say that while growth has been modest recently, the economy is likely to pick\nup speed in the next couple of quarters when the headwinds that have been temporarily\nrestraining growth diminish. My own forecasts have followed this script (at least until earlier this\nyear), as have those of a broad range of forecasters who are polled for a publication known as the\nBlue Chip survey. Despite these optimistic forecasts, the reality has been more modest. Real\nGDP — our broadest measure of overall economic activity — grew by 2.0 percent in 2011, 2.0\npercent in 2012, and it looks like GDP growth this year will again be 2.0 percent.\nAnd yet, if you look at the latest compilation, you see that many forecasters are doing it again.\nThe latest Blue Chip projection, for example, is for 2.8 percent growth in real GDP next year. As\nyou may have guessed, I will share a different view in my remarks today. A growing number of\neconomists have taken on board the disappointing forecasting record of the last few years and\nhave come to believe that growth is more likely than not to remain low in the next few years. In\nfact, some have become quite pessimistic about U.S. growth prospects and have gone so far as to\nuse the word “stagnation.” Personally, I don't think that's warranted. We are certainly living in a\nperiod in which improvements in standards of living are harder to come by. Yet new economic\nopportunities do keep emerging, and innovations are being implemented, although at a more\ntemperate pace than in the past. Even though my near-term forecast is closer to 2 percent than to\n\n1\n\n\f2.8, I also see room for optimism regarding our fundamental prospects. So don't count me among\nthe stagnationists.\nA little more background: Before the Great Recession, we came to enjoy a period known as the\nGreat Moderation. From 1983 to 2007, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent.\nOver that 24-year period, we experienced only two short, shallow recessions that together lasted\nonly five quarters. Real personal income kept pace with GDP, also growing at a 3.3 percent\nannual rate. And consumer spending advanced even more rapidly than income, growing at a 3.6\npercent annual rate.\nPart of the reason consumer spending was able to grow more rapidly than income over that\nperiod was the rise in household wealth. Stock prices, bond prices and housing prices all\nincreased significantly during the Great Moderation. Another reason for the divergence was the\nincrease in credit availability for most consumers. For example, the ratio of credit card debt to\npersonal income rose from 2.4 percent in 1983 to 8.0 percent in 2007.*\nDuring the Great Recession, GDP fell by 4.3 percent over a six-quarter interval, but other\nindicators document even greater hardship. Payroll employment fell by 8.7 million jobs in the\nrecession and its immediate aftermath. The unemployment rate, which was below 5 percent in\n2007, rose to 10 percent in October 2009. Real personal income fell by 3.1 percent from\nDecember 2007 to July 2009. The value of household holdings of stocks and mutual fund shares\nfell by $5 trillion, and the value of household equity in real estate fell by $3.9 trillion. The scale\nand scope of loss of income and wealth experienced by American consumers was far greater than\nanything seen in the previous 20 years.\nGiven that experience, lenders are bound to re-evaluate the riskiness associated with extending\ncredit to a typical household. Indeed, consumers themselves appear to be re-evaluating the\nriskiness associated with indebtedness, no doubt reflecting a sense that their income and asset\nreturns may be substantially riskier than they had come to believe during the Great Moderation.\nUnder these conditions, it's no surprise that credit is no longer available on the same terms. And\nit's no surprise that consumers have been paying off debt and building up savings in order to\nrestore some sense of balance to their household finances.\nThese developments have led consumers to be somewhat cautious in their spending behavior.\nOver the last three years, real consumer spending has increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent.\nGiven the traumatic events in past few years, it strikes me as quite likely that consumer caution is\nnot a temporary headwind and is likely to be very persistent.\nBusinesses also appear to be quite cautious about their investment and hiring plans. A widely\nfollowed index of small business optimism averaged just over 100 during the Great Moderation\nand fell sharply during the recession. Since then it has only partially recovered and was 91.6 last\nmonth. Interestingly, when asked about the single most important problem they face, the most\nfrequent answer in the latest survey was “government regulations and red tape.” This result\naccords with reports that I have been hearing from business contacts for several years now. There\nappears to have been a substantial increase in the pace of regulatory change, which in itself\nseems to be limiting investment and hiring. Moreover, it appears that there is also greater\n2\n\n\funcertainty about the exact requirements of current regulations and the likely impacts of new\nregulations that are coming along. That uncertainty provides an additional reason for firms to\npostpone expansion plans.\nAdding to the uncertainty is the ongoing fiscal drama in Washington. Even with last January's\ntax increases and with the sequester holding down federal spending, the deficit was about 4\npercent of GDP for the 2013 fiscal year. That level is unsustainably high over the long run.\nMoreover, if you take into account the rising costs of medical entitlements and Social Security,\nit's clear that current federal budget plans are unsustainable over the long run. So at some point\nwe can expect some combination of a lower trajectory of federal spending than is given by\ncurrent law, or higher taxes. In the meantime, businesses and households are unsure about how\ntheir tax liabilities will evolve over time, and firms doing business with the federal government\nare uncertain about their prospects as well. Although it's hard to quantify, I believe this budget\nuncertainty is weighing on business hiring and investment decisions.\nSo far I've mentioned consumer spending and business investment, which together account for\nabout four-fifths of the economy. Residential investment is one area in which we have seen\nstrong growth. Last year, real residential investment increased by more than 15 percent, and so\nfar this year it has increased almost 14 percent at an annual rate. Despite that, however, housing\nmarket indicators, such as housing starts and new home sales, remain well below levels that\nmight be considered normal, so there seems to be room for residential investment to continue to\ngrow. But since this is only 3 percent of GDP, it has only a marginal effect on the overall\noutlook.\nGovernment spending has been weak recently, and my guess is that it will make little, if any,\ncontribution to GDP growth next year. And that leaves net exports, which for various reasons are\nalso likely to make little contribution to GDP growth next year. Adding up all these categories of\nspending yields a forecast for GDP growth next year of just a little above 2 percent — not much\ndifferent from what we've seen for the last three years.\nThat's my forecast for next year, but I believe it's important to look at the longer-run trend as\nwell. To do that, it's useful to do a little economic arithmetic — I promise this will be relatively\npainless. Real GDP is the total output of goods and services in the economy. We can break down\nreal GDP growth into two components. One is growth in the number of workers. The other is\ngrowth in the amount of output per worker, also known as productivity. Real GDP growth is just\nthe sum of productivity growth and the growth in the number of workers. It turns out that both of\nthese components have slowed since the Great Moderation.\nStarting first with productivity: From 1983 to 2000, productivity grew at a 1.8 percent annual\nrate. But toward the end of the Great Moderation, productivity growth slowed and over the last\nthree years, productivity has increased at a very modest 0.9 percent annual rate. There are two\nways to look at this, of course. The first is pessimistic — productivity growth is half of what it\nwas during the Great Moderation. The second perspective — the glass-half-full story — is that\nproductivity growth is continuing. This is important because productivity growth ultimately\ndrives the growth in real wages and incomes.\n\n3\n\n\fLooking ahead, forecasting trends in productivity growth is exceedingly difficult. Having said\nthat, it's hard to see why productivity growth would improve dramatically; there's no sign of a\nmajor surge of technical innovation in the pipeline, significant educational improvement or\nsubstantial deregulation — the kind of developments that would lead to major efficiency gains.\nBy the same token, it's hard to see why productivity growth would fall any further. The most\nlikely outcome, in my view, is more of the same, and thus my outlook is that productivity growth\nwill be about 1 percent for a considerable period.\nEmployment growth also has slowed since the Great Moderation. From 1983 to 2000,\nemployment increased at a 1.8 percent annual rate (as estimated in the survey of households).\nOver the last four years, employment growth has been 0.9 percent per year — so employment\ngrowth has fallen by half. An imminent acceleration in employment does not seem likely to me.\nPopulation growth is now only 0.8 percent per year. Moreover, much of that growth is in older\nworkers who are near traditional retirement benchmarks. The so-called “prime working age\npopulation” — those aged 25 to 54 — is barely growing at all. My longer-run view is that the\ngrowth rate of employment is likely to equal the growth rate of population, which is 0.8 percent\nper year.\nIn the short run, it is possible that employment growth will be above 0.8 percent as we continue\nto recover from the recession. But we should also recognize some impediments to rapid\nemployment growth. When the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented, it is likely to add to\nthe cost of hiring an additional worker for many businesses, and firms are still trying to figure\nout just how costly that will be. Also, I've been struck by the large number of accounts I've heard\nrecently about firms having difficulty finding workers with the appropriate skills, in many cases\nconstraining production.\nTo summarize then, I think that in the short run, we are likely to see real GDP growth of 2\npercent, or perhaps a bit higher. Over the longer run, we are likely to see growth average a bit\nbelow 2 percent.\nBefore I wrap things up, I'd like to make some brief observations on inflation and monetary\npolicy. First, it's important to recognize that inflation has been well-behaved over the last 20\nyears. Since 1993, inflation has averaged 1.92 percent, which is remarkably close to the Federal\nOpen Market Committee's goal of 2 percent. Second, we've seen some fluctuations in inflation\nover that time period, but they have all proven to be transitory. For example, inflation averaged\n2.8 percent over the three years ending in December 2007. I mention this because many people\nhave noticed that over the last 12 months inflation has only averaged 0.9 percent. My sense is\nthat inflation will move back toward 2 percent over the next year or two, in part because\nmeasures of expected inflation remain well contained. This is not a certainty, however, and I\nbelieve the FOMC will want to watch this closely.\nAnd that brings us to monetary policy, which has been particularly challenging of late. As you\nmay recall, the Fed reduced its target for the federal funds rate to essentially zero at the end of\n2008. Given the state of the economy, that was the appropriate response of monetary policy. But\nthat brings us face to face with what economists refer to as the zero lower bound. This refers to\nthe fact that it's generally not practical to reduce interest rates below zero. At times, we might\n4\n\n\fwish we could, though, because the interest rate that is relevant for most economic decisions is\nthe real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rate — the nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of\ninflation.\nWe should be clear that an interest rate near zero does not mean the Fed is paralyzed. By\npurchasing assets, we can increase the supply of monetary assets to the banking system, which in\nsome circumstances can have a stimulative effect. The Fed has purchased significant quantities\nof assets since the end of 2008. The size of our balance sheet has gone from $2.2 trillion to\naround $3.9 trillion, and it continues to increase by about $85 billion per month.\nThe key issue, in my view, is the extent to which the benefits of further monetary stimulus are\nlikely to outweigh the costs. Economic growth trends currently appear to be driven mainly by\npopulation growth and productivity growth, in which case monetary stimulus will only have\nlimited and transitory effects. But further stimulus does increase the size of our balance sheet and\ncorrespondingly increases the risks associated with the “exit process” when it becomes time to\nwithdraw stimulus. This is why I have not been in favor of the current asset purchase program.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to return to the theme with which I began. Yes, 2 percent growth is\ndisappointing relative to our experience during the period of the Great Moderation, and yes,\ngrowth may continue at a rate that is slower than in the past. But productivity is rising, incomes\nare growing, and innovation is occurring. Our institutions of higher learning are worldwide\nleaders in research and education, and they continue to attract exceptional students from abroad.\nOur markets remain flexible and resilient. The public policy problems we face may be difficult,\nbut they are certainly not insoluble. Consequently, when I take a broad view, I am fundamentally\noptimistic about our future.\n\n*An earlier version of this speech incorrectly stated the ratio of credit card debt to personal\nincome in 2007 as 5.5 percent.

            "content": "Starting Early in Workforce Development\nNovember 5, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharlotte, N.C.\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here in Charlotte. I’ve enjoyed seeing firsthand some\nexciting new technologies and businesses in the area and meeting with the people who do the\nhard work of preparing the next generation to participate in those industries. That preparation is\nthe focus of my talk today. I’ll begin by reviewing some current facts about the labor market and\nthe implications of those facts for economic inequality and mobility. I’ll then share some\nobservations on our nation’s current system of workforce development. In particular, I’d like to\nsuggest that workforce development programs targeted toward young people have the potential\nto affect not only individual employment outcomes, but also broader issues such as economic\nmobility and inequality. But first I must note that my opinions are my own and may not reflect\nthe opinions of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nSkills, Inequality and Mobility\nAs I’m sure you are all well aware, the U.S. labor market has been weak for quite some time,\nwith the national unemployment rate still above 7 percent and more than 4 million people out of\nwork for more than six months. Here in North Carolina, the unemployment rate is 8.7 percent —\nwell above the national average. What is striking, though, is that the view of the labor market\ndiffers depending on workers’ levels of education: Nationally, the unemployment rate for\nworkers with only a high school degree is 7.6 percent, compared with just 3.7 percent for\nworkers with a college degree. Following the Great Recession, the unemployment rate for noncollege-educated workers peaked at 11 percent, more than double the peak rate of 5.1 percent for\nworkers with at least a bachelor’s degree. To put this number in perspective, consider that the\nhighest unemployment rate suffered by college-educated Americans in the recent recession is\nsimilar to the lowest unemployment rates for the overall population seen in the past four decades.\nIn addition to being relatively insulated from the swings of the business cycle, college-educated\nworkers earn significantly more than workers with less education. The median income for a\ncollege-educated worker is $48,000, compared with $27,000 for a worker with a high school\ndiploma. Over a lifetime, the median worker with a bachelor’s degree can expect to earn $2.3\nmillion, based on 2009 earnings data, compared with just $1.3 million earned by the median\nworker with a high school diploma. 2 This difference is known as the “college premium,” and it’s\n1\n\n\fincreased significantly over the past 30 years. Growth in the premium has slowed over the past\nfew years, but the large gap now appears to be an enduring feature of the U.S. labor market.\nOver the same period, the United States also has experienced a significant decline in\nmanufacturing employment, a result of globalization and of changes in technology that have\nreduced the need for manufacturing workers. In 1980, more than 20 percent of Americans were\nemployed in manufacturing, compared with less than 9 percent today. North Carolina was hit\nespecially hard by declines in U.S. textile and furniture manufacturing, although the state, and\nthe Charlotte region in particular, is now experiencing a resurgence in advanced manufacturing.\nUnlike the manufacturing jobs of the past, however, these new jobs require greater skills and\nsignificant postsecondary education. Other sectors that have traditionally employed workers\nwithout substantial formal education, such as construction, also are upgrading their skill\nrequirements. We recently heard from a homebuilder who said that he won’t hire a worker who\ndoesn’t have good math skills.\nMany people are concerned about the effects of the large skill premium, especially those who see\nit not only as an indicator that some skills are scarce, but also as a nagging reminder of the\ndecline in high-paying opportunities for those unable to acquire the needed skills. This viewpoint\nis supported by recent data on economic inequality and economic mobility, which show that\ninequality has increased in recent years, while mobility has decreased. The rich are increasingly\nlikely to remain rich, and the poor are increasingly likely to remain poor. Many factors\ncontribute to inequality and the persistence of that inequality both within and across generations.\nBut the disparity in outcomes between those who have acquired skills, often in the form of\ncollege education, and those who have not likely plays a large role. The children of college\ngraduates are much more likely to attend and graduate from college themselves, and this fact\nmight have its roots in differences that manifest themselves very early in life.\nThere is a large and persuasive body of evidence that the foundation for academic and labor\nmarket success is laid very early in life, even in infancy. That’s because the early mastery of\nbasic emotional, social and other noncognitive skills appears to make it easier to learn more\ncomplex skills throughout life. As a result, children who fall behind early on have difficulty\ncatching up: Gaps in cognitive skills are present as early as age 4 and tend to persist into\nadulthood. Research also shows, unfortunately, that poor and minority children — who are less\nlikely to have college-educated parents — are much less likely to have access to high-quality\nearly education programs. 3\nWorkforce Development\nWhat do these facts have to do with workforce development? I will suggest that they should\ninfluence our understanding of why certain workforce development programs might or might not\nsucceed, and what outcomes we can reasonably expect. They also suggest that the greatest\npotential may lie in workforce development programs that are targeted toward young people.\nTwo decades ago, workforce development was chiefly concerned with the competitiveness of\nAmerican workers relative to workers in other countries. 4 More recently, the focus has shifted to\naddressing earnings inequality in the long run and assisting workers who have been affected by\n2\n\n\fseparations in the short run. As many of you well know, the most recent piece of federal\nlegislation addressing workforce development is the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.\nIncluded in this Act was an effort to consolidate numerous different programs into “one-stop”\nemployment centers and to give more control back to states and localities by creating workforce\ninvestment boards composed of local business, education and labor leaders. Currently, about\none-third of the nation’s public spending on workforce development flows through these boards.\nThe boards direct three-quarters of their funds toward adults, including displaced workers, and\none-quarter toward low-income youth who face specific barriers to employment, such as being a\nparent, a high school dropout or a juvenile offender.\nIn addition to the programs funded through the Workforce Investment Act, there are dozens of\nother workforce development programs administered by multiple federal agencies. These\nprograms primarily provide training to low-skill adult workers. Relatively little is known about\ntheir effectiveness, however; a review by the Government Accountability Office found that only\nfive of 47 programs had conducted an impact study to determine whether or not measured\nemployment outcomes could actually be attributed to the program. The studies that were\nconducted were inconclusive, and the positive results were generally small and short-term. 5 A\nnumber of academic studies also cast doubt on the effectiveness of job training programs, finding\nthat the effects on employment and job retention are modest at best. 6 Evidence also is mixed\nregarding programs funded through the Workforce Investment Act. Recent research has found\nthat adults who receive general assistance with job search and placement are more likely to\nbecome and remain employed. But the same is not true for displaced workers who receive more\njob-specific training; in fact, several studies have found that such workers might actually be less\nlikely to become employed, perhaps because they stop looking for a job while undergoing\ntraining. 7\nThese results are not necessarily a reflection of the programs’ quality or of the hard work of the\npeople running them. Here in North Carolina, we’re witnessing some important changes to the\norganization and operation of workforce development boards. One of the most significant is an\nincreased focus on employer engagement to ensure that local boards are providing training for\nskills that are in high demand. Local boards also will conduct more worker assessment to help\npeople determine which jobs and training programs will best fit their natural aptitude. Here in\nCharlotte, the local workforce investment board Charlotte Works has already put many of these\nchanges in place.\nBut there may be a larger issue underlying the modest results of many traditional workforce\ndevelopment programs: These programs might simply be reaching some people too late. As I’ve\ndiscussed, early skill acquisition is crucial to laying the foundation for later skill acquisition. It’s\nalso the case that the earlier an investment in human capital is made, the longer the worker will\nhave to realize the returns on that investment. Many of our current programs may intervene too\nlate for workers to make large investments in their human capital and have adequate time to\nrecoup that investment. Of course, I’m not suggesting that older workers cannot or should not\nlearn new skills, or that an adult who dropped out of high school cannot go on to earn a college\ndegree later in life. But broadly speaking, there may be workforce development strategies that\ncould be more effective in assisting the majority of workers.\n\n3\n\n\fGetting an Early Start\nAs I mentioned, about one-quarter of Workforce Investment Act funds are directed toward\nprograms that serve young people facing considerable challenges. Traditionally, the goal has\nbeen remediation: to help the participants achieve basic literacy or minimum credentials, such as\na GED. As with adult programs, the results of these youth programs have been mixed at best. But\nwe are now seeing a shift toward providing not just remediation, but also knowledge and\ninspiration about different career opportunities. Local workforce investment boards are touring\nlabs and manufacturing facilities, arranging for young people to participate with first responders\nin disaster preparedness drills, and sponsoring robotics competitions. The private sector also is\nreaching out to young people, for example by partnering with high schools such as Charlotte’s\nOlympic High School to offer advanced manufacturing internships and apprenticeships.\nThese programs also show young people that there are a variety of paths they can follow after\nhigh school. Given the rising college premium and the relative insulation from economic shocks\nprovided by a college degree, it’s understandable that many policymakers have focused on\nincreasing college enrollment. But when promoting college as a pathway, we must acknowledge\na sobering reality: Currently, only a little more than half of students who matriculate at a fouryear college complete a bachelor’s degree within six years. 8 What’s worse, there is relatively\nlittle benefit, at least in terms of earnings, for students who attend for a year or two but do not\ngraduate. Median weekly earnings for a worker with some college but no degree are about 15\npercent higher than the earnings of a high school graduate, compared with about 80 percent\nhigher for a worker with a bachelor’s degree. And dropping out of college can be expensive: The\naverage debt burden among all college dropouts is more than $7,000; among only those dropouts\nwho borrowed, it’s more than $14,000.\nMany students and families could benefit from better information about the level of preparation\nrequired to succeed in college, as well as about options they could pursue after high school other\nthan enrolling in a four-year college. Community colleges, for example, are a venue where\nstudents can learn more about their interests and aptitudes and practice the skills that are required\nfor success at a four-year school, all the while preserving their option to continue on toward a\nfour-year degree. And for some students, pursuing a bachelor’s degree might never be their\npreferred path. These students would be well served by learning about other postsecondary\neducation options that could improve their labor market outcomes relative to only completing\nhigh school or dropping out of college. Recent research suggests that people vary in the returns\nthey’re likely to earn from formal education versus learning on the job, and some are likely to\nearn higher returns from working than from, say, a bachelor’s degree. 9 For these workers, it is\nexciting to see the growing number of high schools and community colleges that are partnering\nwith businesses to offer vocational training and apprenticeship programs that equip students with\nspecialized skills, such as those especially useful in advanced manufacturing. 10 Charlotte has\nbeen a national leader in this area with the Apprenticeship 2000 program, a partnership between\nlocal businesses and Central Piedmont Community College. I had the pleasure of seeing that\nprogram in practice at Siemens Energy yesterday.\nProviding students with more information about such programs also might reduce the high\nschool dropout rate. Nationally, more than 20 percent of high school students do not graduate in\nfour years, and many of those students never graduate at all. That measure climbs to more than\n4\n\n\f40 percent in some large urban school districts.* Given that dropping out of high school has been\ndescribed as an “economic death sentence,” 11 these numbers are unacceptably high. Some\nresearchers have suggested that the focus of most high schools on college preparation, to the\nexclusion of other options, is a factor in the dropout rate. If the only reason to graduate from high\nschool is to enroll in college, then students who do not wish to attend college, or perceive large\nbarriers to doing so, might not see much value in graduating. For these students, learning about\nviable career and educational alternatives could improve their appreciation of the value of\nfinishing high school.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, I’ve noted that college graduates earn significantly more than people who have not\ngraduated from college, and they also tend to fare better during economic downturns. Over the\nsame period that the college premium has been growing, manufacturing employment, which used\nto provide relatively high-paying jobs for workers without college degrees, has declined\nsignificantly.\nI’ve also talked about the possibility that some traditional workforce development programs are\nreaching workers too late to make large investments in their human capital. But we are now\nseeing a tremendous amount of energy devoted to programs targeting young people, both in the\nprivate sector and at some workforce investment boards. These programs have the potential to\nsignificantly improve educational and job prospects for students who might otherwise have\ndropped out of high school, or enrolled in but failed to complete college.\nBut we are not concerned with high school or college completion rates simply because of the\nimplications for the production of goods and services. Instead, our concern stems from what\nthese numbers indicate about the well-being of the people underlying those statistics and their\nability to achieve a secure economic future for themselves and, perhaps more importantly, for\ntheir children. When we look at disparities in economic outcomes across our society, it is clear\nthat differences in human capital accumulation play a large role — and human capital\naccumulation begins very early in life. Doing our utmost to help the next generation of workers\nmake the best use of their talents and opportunities will lay the groundwork for their children to\nachieve their full potential, and for the United States to achieve a more inclusive prosperity.\n\n*An earlier version of this speech cited the 8 percent “status dropout rate,” which is the percent of 16- through 24year-olds who are not enrolled in school and have not earned a high school diploma or a GED. The text has been\ncorrected to reflect the percentage of students who do not graduate from high school within four years, according to\nthe National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero, Urvi Neelakantan, and Kartik Athreya for assistance in preparing\nthis speech.\n2\nAnthony P.

            "content": "Global Interdependence and Central Banking\nNovember 1, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nThank you very much. Because of my deep respect for the ideals and mission of the Global\nInterdependence Center, I am honored and humbled to receive the Global Citizen Award. Like\nvirtually all economists, the considerable benefits of the open international exchange of goods,\nservices, ideas and people are to me self-evident. So the mission of the GIC ― “to improve\ncooperation and understanding among nations, with the goal of reducing international conflicts\nand improving worldwide living standards” ― is one that I support with enthusiasm.\nI have my own historic link to the GIC as well. From 1977 to 1979, and then again in 1980, I\nworked at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates ― better known as “WEFA” ― under\nProfessor Lawrence Klein, who passed away just a fortnight ago. Professor Klein, besides being\na Nobel laureate and an econometric pioneer, was an early GIC leader and most recently its vice\nchair emeritus. I knew him as a dedicated researcher with an utterly amazing command of\nmacroeconomic facts. I recall seeing him walk to a podium with a small scrap of paper on which\nhe had jotted three or four numbers from that day’s statistical releases and talk authoritatively for\nan hour straight about the economic outlook for each of the major industrial countries. But I also\nknew him as a soft-spoken and humble man. For example, when I knew him at WEFA he drove\na Dodge Dart.\nThere is a deeper connection as well, though, which I would like to explore with you today.\nGlobal interdependence is essential to understanding the institution at which I have made my\ncareer, the Federal Reserve. When the Federal Reserve Act was signed, 100 years ago this\nDecember 23, the continued operation of the classical gold standard was presumed, and our\ninstitution was designed around the need to sustain it. Less well-known is the extent to which\ncompetition for the business of international trade finance played a role in the passage of the\nFederal Reserve Act and some of the most noteworthy institutional features of the Fed as well.\nAnd during pivotal episodes in the history of the Fed, international monetary considerations\nplayed a decisive role in shaping decisions and events. More recently, the U.S. financial crisis of\n2007–08 and the events leading up to it cannot be understood completely without an appreciation\nof financial institutions and economic policy abroad. So I think it’s fair to say that one can’t tell\nthe full story of the Federal Reserve without an international perspective. I also can’t tell the\nstory without the usual Fed disclaimer, namely, that the views I express are my own and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\n\fThe Gold Standard\nThe international dimensions of central banking have long been recognized by specialists, but\nthey get less attention in popular media coverage than they deserve. At the founding of the Fed,\nthe international considerations were two-fold. 1 First was the fact that when the Fed was\nfounded, the U.S. adhered to the gold standard. The governments of participating countries stood\nready to convert their (paper) currency into gold at a fixed rate. Under this system, the long-run\nstability of the purchasing power of money would be assured as long as the U.S. and other\ncountries adhered to the “rules of the game.” These rules required that countries allow gold flows\narising out of balance of payments gaps to have the appropriate equilibrating effects on domestic\neconomic conditions.\nThe Fed was envisioned as operating within and facilitating adherence to the gold standard.\nWhile price stability was an important goal of the founders of the Fed, one to which they\nexpected the Fed to contribute, their focus in founding the Fed was something else entirely. It\nwas to solve “the currency problem.” This is an unfamiliar term to modern ears, so it deserves a\nbit of explanation. Before the founding of the Fed, paper currency was supplied by national\nbanks, but was subject to a collateral requirement that dated back to the Civil War; banks’ note\nissues had to be backed by holdings of U.S. government bonds. The aggregate supply of notes\nwas widely described as “inelastic,” because expanding a bank’s note issue was often costly and\ncumbersome. At times, the public demand for notes rose as the public sought to convert bank\ndeposits into paper currency or gold. This typically occurred during the autumn harvest season\nand the holiday shopping season, as well as during so-called banking panics, when bank\ncustomers sought to pull deposits out of banks.\nThe inelasticity of the physical supply of bank notes meant that other adjustments had to take\nplace instead. Interest rates tended to be higher in the fall and winter, for example, and tended to\nspike during panics when the banking system scrambled for currency. Significant inflows of gold\nfrom abroad occurred at such times as well. Imperfections in the U.S. banking system caused\ndomestic money demand shocks to be transmitted throughout international financial markets.\nAnother adaptation to the regulatory constraints on note supply was payment suspensions. Banks\nwould at times prevent depositors from withdrawing their entire account. At times, all the banks\nin a clearinghouse would suspend withdrawals but allow transfers between clearinghouse banks.\nSuspensions were a disruptive and dysfunctional feature of the pre-Fed banking system.\nThus the preamble of the Federal Reserve Act lists as one of its purposes “to furnish an elastic\ncurrency.” The ultimate objective can be thought of as keeping the defective legislative\nframework around U.S. banking from damaging domestic and international markets.\nInternational Considerations at the Founding of the Fed\nThere were broader international considerations at work in the founding of the Fed than simply\nthe operation of the gold standard, however. Following the Panic of 1907, an influential group of\nNew York bankers was instrumental in the campaign for the creation of a central bank in the\n2\n\n\fU.S. 2 This group included Benjamin Strong, an associate of J.P. Morgan and later the first head\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Paul Warburg, the German-born financier at\nKuhn Loeb. They broadly shared an “internationalist” view that America had emerged as a world\npower and should play an expanded international diplomatic and economic role. 3 Creating a\ncentral bank was integral to promoting the U.S. role in the world economy.\nEurope, for this group, provided the natural institutional models for a central bank. Many of\nthese bankers were very familiar with the central banks of Europe, particularly Warburg, whose\nfamily was active in finance there. In a number of European countries, the central bank issued\ntheir own notes and accepted deposits from banks, which enabled them to rapidly expand or\ncontract the supply of notes in response to fluctuations in demand. Liabilities were at least partly\nbacked by holdings of gold, either in the form of coins or bullion. The Federal Reserve Act\nincluded a 40 percent gold cover requirement so that the Reserve Banks’ money supply would\ntend to expand or contract with the movement of gold into and out of the country, as required by\nthe rules of the gold standard.\nWhile these New York bankers were eager to solve the “currency problem,” a second critical\nmotivation for the founding of the Fed was a desire for New York to supplant London as a center\nof trade finance. One provision of the Act allowed national banks for the first time to issue\n“bankers’ acceptances” ― a type of commercial paper (three- to six-months maturity) that arose\nout of the financing of international trade flows. Typically these were the short-term obligations\nof an importer that were endorsed by the importer’s bank. The bank could then “discount” or sell\nthe obligation to third parties. Prior to the Federal Reserve Act, banks in the U.S. generally were\nnot allowed to endorse such obligations, so markets in such instruments were virtually\nnonexistent. Importers in the U.S. typically issued such bills through a European bank, even\nwhen the import was from Latin America and did not involve Europe. 4 Creating a New York\nmarket in bankers’ acceptances helped promote U.S. trade with the rest of the world, and bring a\nlucrative business to the New York banks.\nEuropean central banks at the time, such as the Bank of England, bought or lent against such\ninstruments, a process called “rediscounting.” That provided a backstop of support that was\nthought essential to the liquidity of a market for acceptances. Indeed, according to Warburg:\n“The central bank system and the discount system cannot be separated; they are absolutely\ninterdependent.” 5 Another purpose of the Federal Reserve Act, therefore, was “to afford means\nof rediscounting commercial paper.” The Reserve Banks were authorized to rediscount a variety\nof commercial paper, as long as it wasn’t backed by stocks or bonds. They were also authorized\nto make outright purchases of bankers’ acceptances.\nWorld War I did a great deal to reorder the international financial system. But among those\nchanges was a significant shift in the bankers’ acceptance market to New York City. By the\n1920s, thanks in part to the active encouragement and support of the New York Fed under\nStrong, the New York acceptance market had grown significantly.\n\n3\n\n\fCritical Episodes in Fed History\nThe demise of the gold standard played a pivotal role at the beginning of the Great Depression,\narguably the most critical episode in the Fed’s history. Strong had passed away, and without him,\npolicymakers struggled with conflicting signals from domestic stabilization needs and gold\nstandard precepts, which impeded interest rate reductions that might have stemmed the fall in the\nmoney supply and the catastrophic deflation that raised real rates. 6 Barry Eichengreen, a leading\nscholar of the interwar international monetary arrangements, argues that the gold standard broke\ndown because its success required credibility and cooperation, both of which were in short\nsupply as the 1920s wore on, because of domestic political developments. 7 Countries left the\ngold standard in succession as they found its defense intolerably costly.\nThe result was misdirected Fed policy that contributed to declines of nearly 30 percent in the\nmoney supply and the overall price level from 1929 to 1933. This resulted in a broad shock to\nborrowers’ ability to repay, which weakened many banks and led depositors to withdraw their\nfunds. The resulting runs led to waves of bank failures, which further exacerbated the\ncontraction.\nWhile current research suggests that other aspects of government policy also may have played\nsignificant roles in the depth and length of the Great Depression, monetary instability was clearly\nconsequential and clearly the fault of the Federal Reserve. As a Fed governor in 2002, current\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke famously acknowledged and apologized for the Fed’s role in the\nGreat Depression. 8\nInternational considerations also played a role in what is arguably the second most critical\nepisode in the Fed’s history: the Great Inflation that occurred from the late 1960s through the\nearly 1980s. International monetary arrangements were reconstructed at the end of World War II\nunder the Bretton Woods gold-exchange system. Currency values were fixed relative to gold, but\nwith intermittent discretionary changes in parities. Tension again arose between domestic\nadjustment and defending a given parity. Political pressures on the Federal Reserve in the late\n1960s and early 1970s impeded actions that would have prevented the rise in inflation. 9 Rather\nthan make the requisite adjustments in the exchange value of the dollar, in 1971, the Nixon\nadministration simply abandoned convertibility of the dollar into gold. Bretton Woods collapsed\nsoon thereafter.\nCentral banks around the globe were forced to adapt to a world of fiat monies, in which price\nstability rests ultimately on the credibility of government commitments to keeping inflation low.\nTough actions were required to bring inflation back under control, but important lessons were\nlearned. In particular, a measure of central bank independence proved invaluable in the fight\nagainst inflation. Institutional arrangements that helped insulate the central bank’s setting of the\npolicy rate from partisan electoral pressures while clarifying accountability for macroeconomic\nperformance, allowed the central bank to focus on longer-run objectives.\n\n4\n\n\fThe Recent Crisis\nThe recent crisis has given rise to serious questions about central bank independence, however.\nWhat’s important for stabilizing inflation is the central bank’s ability to independently control its\nmonetary liabilities. But that independence comes with discretion over the central bank’s asset\nportfolio as well. Unless prevented by legal restrictions, the central bank’s balance sheet can be\nused to fund lending interventions. Such intervention constitutes fiscal policy, in the sense that,\nholding the central bank’s liabilities constant, funding comes from the sale of securities, such as\ngovernment debt, to the public. To the extent that lending operations are viewed as rescuing the\ncreditors of large financial institutions, the central bank risks becoming embroiled in\ndistributional political disputes. And to the extent that expectations of such rescue operations\ndistort incentives and encourage fragile financing arrangements, the central bank can be accused\nof having contributed to the “too big to fail” problem.\nThe dilemma posed by a central bank’s asset portfolio plays out differently in different settings.\nThe European Central Bank, for example, can face the politically awkward situation of having to\nweigh in on the relative value of the sovereign debt of different euro member states.\nInternational considerations were critical in the crisis of 2007–08. The first special lending\nprogram introduced by the Federal Reserve ― the Term Auction Facility ― was dominated by\nforeign financial institutions. The TAF, introduced in December 2007, auctioned term credit\nfrom the Reserve Banks’ discount windows. Foreign institutions held large dollar-denominated\npositions in illiquid assets, such as mortgage-backed securities, that they had trouble funding.\nBanks in the U.S. had access to borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks and made major\nuse of that source of funds when credit risk premiums rose in the third quarter of 2007.\nMore broadly, the subprime mortgage risk that was at the heart of the crisis was held\ndisproportionately by foreign investors and foreign financial institutions, along with Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac, the U.S. housing intermediaries. The foreign financial institutions involved\nwere arguably affected by the incentive distortions that accompany perceived public sector\nsupport. Incompletely contained moral hazard in one country can infect and distort financial\nmarkets around the globe. For some time, central banks have been heavily involved in the\ninternational negotiations aimed at leveling the regulatory playing field across countries. Postcrisis efforts to construct more robust and sustainable financial regulatory regimes have been\nmediated through several international forums that bring together central banks as well as the\nrelevant national regulators. Finding a balanced approach to financial stability will be\nchallenging.\nConclusion\nThis has been a brief “helicopter tour” of a century of U.S. central banking, one that’s covered\ntoo much territory to be able to examine any of the terrain in depth. I’ve tried to highlight the\nways in which international considerations were not just another part of the story, but were\nintegral to the entire narrative. I hope it illustrates the ways in which awareness of global\ninterdependence is essential for understanding the 100 year history of the Federal Reserve.\n\n5\n\n\f1\n\nFor a companion account focusing on the reasons behind the founding of the Fed, see Jeffrey M.

            "content": "Toward Orderly Resolution\nOctober 18, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nFederal Reserve 2013 Resolution Conference\nWashington, D.C.\n\nWelcome to the Federal Reserve 2013 Resolution Conference. This gathering is sponsored\njointly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Richmond. Our objective is to stimulate constructive dialogue among knowledgeable\nprofessionals and the practitioners involved in constructing and assessing resolution plans. This\nis a critically important element of our collective response to the financial crisis.\nTitle I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain large U.S. financial institutions submit\nresolution plans to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As most\nof you know, a resolution plan describes a firm’s strategy for liquidation or reorganization under\nthe U.S. bankruptcy code, without extraordinary government assistance, in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. The heart of the plan is the specification of the actions the firm\nwould take to facilitate rapid and orderly resolution and prevent adverse effects of failure,\nincluding the firm’s strategy for maintaining the operations of and funding for its critical\noperations and material entities.\nSeparate from Title I, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the FDIC to take a firm into\nreceivership if there is a determination that, among other things, the firm’s failure under the U.S.\nbankruptcy code would have serious adverse effects on “financial stability.” One difference\nbetween Title II and the bankruptcy code is that Title II gives the FDIC the ability to borrow\nfunds from the U.S. Treasury to make payments to creditors of the failed firm or to guarantee the\nliabilities of the failed firm. 1 The funds are to be repaid from recoveries on the assets of the\nfailed firm or from assessments against the largest, most complex financial companies.\nClearly, the Dodd-Frank Act envisions bankruptcy without government support as the first and\nmost preferable option in the case of a failing financial institution, and for good reason, in my\nopinion. If Title I resolution comes to be expected as the norm, the incentives of market\nparticipants will be much better aligned with our public policy goal of a financial system that\neffectively allocates capital and risks. Large financial firms will prefer to be less leveraged and\nless reliant on short-term funding. Institutions and markets would, accordingly, be more resilient\nin response to financial stress. Policymakers could then credibly commit to avoiding rescues,\nwhich would reinforce appropriate incentives. In short, robust Title I resolution planning is a\n\n\fstrong complement to the array of ongoing enhancements to prudential supervision that are\naimed at reducing the likelihood of failure.\nA critical success factor for resolution plans is that, in the event of financial distress,\npolicymakers will view them as making bankruptcy preferable to alternative approaches, such as\nTitle II, in which government funding protects some creditors, the prospect of which blunts\nincentives. Title I stipulates that the Federal Reserve and the FDIC can jointly determine that a\nplan is “not credible,” meaning that it would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the\nbankruptcy code. In this case, the firm would be required to submit a revised plan to address\nidentified deficiencies, including altering business operations or corporate structure. If the Fed\nand the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not remedy identified deficiencies,\nthey can mandate tighter capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrict the growth,\nactivities or operations of the firm. In essence, regulators can order changes in the structure and\noperations of a firm to make it resolvable in bankruptcy without government assistance.\nA veritable army of professionals has been devoting considerable time and effort to crafting and\nevaluating Title I resolution plans. Many of you have enlisted in this army, although some of you\nmay have been drafted. The initial wave of firms has provided two rounds of submissions\nalready. Another wave of firms submitted plans midyear, and a third wave is slated to submit\nplans at year-end. Substantial work remains to be done, however, and substantial issues remain\nto be sorted out before regulators and policymakers can convince market participants of the\ncredibility of these plans.\nEnsuring that the relevant portion of the financial sector is covered by robust and credible\nresolution plans can seem like a daunting task. The critical feature to keep in mind, however, is\nthat resolution planning in some sense reverses the usual bankruptcy planning exercise. Instead\nof asking how to take a given financial institution through bankruptcy, Title I asks us to work\nbackward from bankruptcy resolution and determine what the institution needs to look like in\norder for that bankruptcy to be orderly. It invites us to not take any aspect of the structure and\nfinancing of a large financial institution as fixed.\nThis perspective casts a new light on financial firm characteristics ― such as short-term funding\nstrategies ― that might appear to pose impediments to orderly resolution without government\nsupport. Credibility may require altering the funding profile of the firm so that debtor-inpossession financing needs in bankruptcy are manageable without public sector funds.\nResolution planning will require a great deal of hard work. But I see no other way to ensure that\npolicymakers have confidence in unassisted bankruptcy and that investors are convinced that\nunassisted bankruptcy is the norm, both of which strike me as necessary to solving the “too big\nto fail” problem. Resolution planning provides a framework for identifying the actions we need\nto take now to ensure that the next financial crisis is handled appropriately, in a way that is fair to\ntaxpayers and establishes the right incentives. While I expect we will hear diverse perspectives\ntoday on many key issues, I am sure we all share that goal. To that end, I am very much looking\nforward to our discussions today.\n\n\f1\n\nFor a comparison of the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions with the U.S. bankruptcy process, see Sabrina R.\nPellerin and John R.

            "content": "Human Capital Investment as a Major Financial Decision\nOctober 4, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCouncil for Economic Education’s 52nd Annual Conference\nBaltimore, Md.\n\nThank you for the privilege of speaking with you today. The Federal Reserve Bank of\nRichmond, like the other 11 regional Reserve Banks around the country, has a rich financial\neducation program for teachers and students at all levels. At first, it might not be obvious why\nthe Federal Reserve is interested in financial education. In the news and in textbooks, the role of\nthe Fed is to conduct monetary policy in order to fulfill our dual mandate of price stability and\nmaximum employment. But as we’ve seen during the recovery from the Great Recession, there\nare significant limits to the power of monetary policy to affect the real economy. Federal Reserve\npolicy actions cannot necessarily counteract the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty, declining\nproductivity growth or structural changes in the labor market — all of which now appear to be\nplaying a role to some degree.\nRecent events have sent us a clear message related to the employment part of our mandate. The\nGreat Recession had a substantial impact on the labor market experiences of many Americans.\nBut as I will spell out today, skill level made a large difference in the ability of individuals to\nweather the recession and its aftermath. The opportunities available to current and future cohorts\nof young Americans thus seem inextricably tied to the skills they acquire. As a result, there are\npotentially enormous payoffs to bolstering economic and financial literacy on the critical issue of\nyoung people’s investments in their own human capital. By providing people better information\nand enabling them to make better choices, we can have an effect on a range of personal and\nsocial outcomes, from employment and standards of living to economic mobility and inequality.\nToday, I’d like to talk to you about the principles that motivate the Richmond Fed’s approach to\nfinancial education and how those principles relate to what we have learned from a large body of\nempirical and theoretical research on human capital accumulation. They suggest that our current\nfocus on helping students decide how to pay for college — which presumes that college is\nnecessarily the right choice for everyone and that success is guaranteed — might be misplaced.\nInstead, a better focus might be educating students about both the risks and rewards of college so\nthey can understand whether it is the right choice for them and how to enhance their prospects of\nsuccess. Before I begin, I should note that these are my own opinions and not those of my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nEconomic Principles of Financial Education\n\n1\n\n\fA moment ago, I referred to helping people make better choices, but I use the word “better”\ncautiously. Some financial education efforts, while well-intentioned, presume that consumers are\nprone to making financial mistakes — and, moreover, that certain decisions, such as taking out\nan adjustable-rate mortgage or a short-term high-interest loan, are always mistakes. From an\neconomist’s perspective, however, it’s extremely hard for outside observers to determine when a\nconsumer has made a mistake — although it’s easy for observers to conclude that they would\nhave chosen differently for themselves. But choices should depend on the preferences and\nconstraints of the consumer who is making the decision, not on the limited information and\nbeliefs of the observer. In general, prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approaches to financial decisionmaking may be unproductive. For a consumer who plans to sell a home in a few years, for\nexample, an adjustable-rate mortgage might be an advantageous option when compared to the\nfixed-rate loan with a higher interest rate that might be preferred by those planning to remain in\ntheir home for a longer time.\nConsumers would benefit, however, from high-quality information that helps them determine the\nbest choice for their particular circumstances, particularly for major financial decisions. This is\nwhere I believe we have the greatest opportunity to make a difference.\nA major financial decision, in my view, has four salient characteristics. First, the consequences\nare significant. Attending college, for example, has large financial implications; future earnings\nare uncertain, and many students and parents need to take out sizeable student loans. Second, that\nsignificance is compounded by the fact that the decision is irreversible and illiquid. While you\nmight forget the particulars of some of your classes, once you’ve paid your tuition, you can’t\ndecide to unlearn your knowledge and exchange it for some other good. Third, a major financial\ndecision happens infrequently. College is generally an investment that you make only once,\nwhich limits the opportunities you have to learn from experience. Finally, it’s complex. Figuring\nout how much to spend on college requires you to make estimates about the returns to your\ninvestment 30 years or more in the future.\nWith these characteristics in mind, the Richmond Fed recently launched a new website,\nmajorfinancialdecisions.org, which provides information on buying versus renting a home,\nplanning for retirement and financing college. Each of these decisions is significant, long-lasting,\ninfrequent and complex, so financial education is likely to be especially valuable to the\nconsumer. 2 Today, I want to focus on the last of those decisions, or more precisely, on the even\nbigger question that precedes the decision about how to finance college: Is college necessarily\nthe right investment for every student?\nCollege Is a Wise Investment\nDuring the 2010–2011 school year, the published price for a year of tuition, room and board at a\nfour-year college averaged about $16,000 at public schools and about $33,000 at private schools.\nOverall, college costs have increased 35 percent in real terms since just a decade earlier. Most\nstudents pay less than the sticker price through a combination of student aid and tax benefits, but\nthe numbers still are quite daunting.\n\n2\n\n\fThe well-publicized increase in tuition rates does not appear to have deterred many people from\nattending: Enrollment increased 37 percent between 2000 and 2010. Only part of that increase is\ndue to population growth; the number of 18- to 24-year-olds enrolled in college increased 34\npercent during that period, compared to just 13 percent growth in that population group overall.\nThe increase in enrollment has been accompanied by a dramatic rise in student loan debt, to\nalmost $1 trillion, about triple the level in 2004. In part, this is because the number of borrowers\nhas increased, as you might expect given the increase in enrollment, but the amount borrowed\nalso has risen considerably. Between 2005 and 2012, average debt per borrower increased 56\npercent, from $16,000 to $25,000.\nOn average, this investment pays off well. The median income for a college-educated worker is\n$48,000, compared to $27,000 for a worker with a high school diploma. Over a lifetime, the\nmedian worker with a bachelor’s degree can expect to earn $2.3 million, based on 2009 earnings\ndata, compared to just $1.3 million earned by the median worker with a high school diploma. 3\nWorkers with college degrees also fare better during economic downturns. Following the Great\nRecession, for example, the unemployment rate for college-educated workers peaked at 5.1\npercent, compared to 11 percent for non-college-educated workers. As of August, the\nunemployment rate for workers with a high school diploma was more than double that of\nworkers with a bachelor’s degree or higher — 7.6 percent compared to 3.5 percent. And even\nthough many recent college graduates appear underemployed, they’re still earning more than\ntheir non-college-educated co-workers in the same positions. 4\nBut Is College a Wise Investment for Everyone?\nThe data I just described are averages, and for the average enrollee, college certainly appears to\nbe a prudent investment. But averages, as we all know, can obscure meaningful nuances.\nFirst, earnings data are collected from students who complete college; a student who has not yet\nenrolled may not realize the same return on investment, perhaps because that particular student\ndiffers in some way from the average attendee. But there may well be an important difference\nbetween the premium earned by the average student and the premium earned by the marginal\nstudent. Indeed, some research suggests that as much as half of the college premium is due to\n“selection,” not necessarily the degree itself, meaning that students who choose to enroll in and\ncomplete college are inherently different in some way from those who do not, and those\ndifferences account for about half of the disparity in their earnings. 5 There also is wide variation\nin earnings across majors and occupations. For example, the median income for a worker with a\nbachelor’s degree in counseling psychology is $29,000, little more than the median income of a\nhigh school graduate, as opposed to $120,000 for the recipient of a degree in petroleum\nengineering. 6\nPerhaps the most crucial caveat, however, is that the returns to college depend on finishing\ncollege. There is relatively little benefit, at least in terms of earnings, for students who attend for\na year or two but do not graduate. Median weekly earnings for a worker with some college but\nno degree are about 15 percent higher than the earnings of a high school graduate, compared to\nabout 80 percent higher for a worker with a bachelor’s degree.\n3\n\n\fWe are not talking about a small number of students: Government data show that only a little\nmore than half of students who matriculate at a four-year college complete a bachelor’s degree\nwithin six years. 7 The completion rates are considerably lower for African-American and\nHispanic students, for students from poor families and for students who are the first members of\ntheir families to attend college. Dropping out of college is expensive: The average debt burden\namong all college dropouts is more than $7,000; among only those dropouts who borrowed, it’s\nmore than $14,000.\nOne intuitively appealing explanation for the high college dropout rate is that students and their\nfamilies are credit constrained, and thus unable to continue to finance a college education. Most\nresearch, however, suggests that credit constraints are not a significant factor in the dropout\ndecision. Part of the explanation might be the rise in the number of nontraditional students who\nare balancing work and family responsibilities and thus find it more challenging to complete a\ndegree. But much of the explanation appears to lie in the fact that many of the students who\nenroll in college do not have an accurate assessment of their own readiness for college. Students\nwho enroll presumably believe that the benefits of college attendance are likely to exceed the\ncosts. But as I have discussed, the net economic gain from attending just a year or two of college\nappears to be quite small — which suggests that something must happen in college to students’\nbeliefs about their likelihood of succeeding. Survey evidence has demonstrated that this is in fact\nthe case. 8 When asked, entering college students are highly optimistic about their grades, and\nthey say that they intend to complete a bachelor’s degree within four years. But as they take\nclasses and exams, they revise their assessments of their future performances, and these updated\nbeliefs then play a large role in the dropout decision. These surveys also show that students from\npoor families are more likely to drop out, and drop out sooner, than students from wealthier\nfamilies.\nEquipping Students to Make Good Education Decisions\nWhat do these facts about the high rate of college noncompletion have to do with economic\neducation? As I mentioned at the beginning of this talk, many involved in financial education,\nthe Richmond Fed included, have focused their efforts on informing students about the costs of\nstate versus private school or explaining the many types of federal and private loans that are\navailable. But I would encourage financial education practitioners to give thought to just where\nthe provision of information can yield the greatest marginal benefit. The research I’ve touched\nupon here suggests that might be before the decision to attend college is made. The decision to\ninvest in human capital is fraught with uncertainty as it is. This suggests that prospective college\nstudents would benefit from realistic appraisals of their odds of success, as well as a better\nappreciation of how good preparation for college can improve those odds.\nMany students and families also could benefit from information about options they could pursue\nafter high school other than enrolling in a four-year college. Community colleges, for example,\nare a venue where students can learn more about their interests and aptitudes and practice the\nskills that are required for success at a four-year school, all the while preserving their option to\ncontinue onward toward a four-year degree. And for some students, pursuing a bachelor’s degree\nmight never be their preferred path. These students would be well served by learning about other\n4\n\n\fpost-secondary educational options that could improve their labor market outcomes relative to\nonly completing high school or dropping out of college. For example, a growing number of high\nschools and community colleges are partnering with businesses to offer vocational training and\napprenticeship programs that equip students with specialized training, such as skills especially\nuseful in advanced manufacturing. 9 These skills are in high demand by employers — and may be\nless vulnerable to automation or offshoring than many traditional white-collar jobs.\nIn addition, the flipside of the dropout problem is the failure of relatively high-achieving students\nto apply to college. At first glance, these students might appear myopic or impatient, unwilling to\nwait for the returns on their investments; in economic terms, they would be described as having\nvery high discount rates. But that assumes that these students have accurate information on\nwhich to base their calculations. In fact, many students, particularly low-income students,\noverestimate the costs of college and underestimate their opportunities for financial aid. 10\nStudents might also face social norms that cause them to undervalue the future payoffs or their\nlikelihoods of success. In these cases, what looks like impatience might simply be a lack of\ninformation, as demonstrated by several recent studies.\nIn one study, researchers found that sending targeted information to low-income, high-achieving\nstudents, at a cost of only $6 per student, increased their matriculation rates at selective\ncolleges. 11 Another study focused on high school seniors in New Hampshire who had 10th-grade\ntest scores similar to the scores of college enrollees but were at risk of not applying to college. 12\nIt found that providing them with mentors and assistance with application forms and tests\nsignificantly increased women’s college enrollment, although not men’s, and that so far, these\nstudents are as likely to remain in college as other high school students in the state. This research\nsuggests that information can play an important role in changing the beliefs of students who\nerroneously think that they’re not college material.\nEarly Intervention\nAs I have discussed, the low rate of college completion appears to stem from the fact that many\nstudents are not well prepared for college. One option for improving college completion rates\nand job prospects for potential dropouts is to provide them with accurate information about the\ncosts and benefits of a variety of post-secondary education options. But it’s not enough to ask\nwhat we can do when a student is 16 or 18 or 20 years old. Instead, it’s worth asking why some\nstudents — too many students — are poorly prepared in the first place.\nNumerous researchers and policymakers are currently debating what reforms to our education\nsystem might have the greatest impact on student achievement. But one area where I believe we\nhave very strong evidence for the benefits of reform is in early childhood education. There is\nconsensus now that the foundation for academic and labor market success is laid very early in\nlife, even in infancy. That’s because the early mastery of basic emotional, social and other\nnoncognitive skills makes it easier to learn more complex skills throughout life. As a result,\nchildren who fall behind early on have difficulty catching up: Gaps in cognitive skills are present\nas early as age four and tend to persist into adulthood. But intervening early can yield large\nreturns; many researchers have found that the return on a dollar invested in human capital is\n\n5\n\n\fhighest when the investment occurs at age 3, and children who receive high-quality early\neducation fare much better on a variety of socioeconomic measures.\nResearch also shows, however, that poor and minority children are much less likely to have\naccess to such early education programs and are much more likely to fall behind. Greater\ninvestment in early interventions thus could help ensure that future choices about how much to\ninvest in a student’s human capital aren’t limited by family background, and that more people\nhave the opportunity to achieve their potential. 13\nConclusion\nTo sum up, then, the most critical economic decisions people face over their lifetime concern\ninvestments in their human capital. Financial education has traditionally promoted college\nenrollment by providing prospective students with information on financing options. But success\nin college is by no means automatic, and the benefits of attending — but not completing —\ncollege are relatively low. I have advocated that financial educators shift toward informing\nstudents about the value of college preparedness and the value of alternatives to a traditional\nfour-year college degree, such as community colleges and vocational and apprenticeship\nprograms. In addition, making sure students are well aware of the magnitude of the return to\nsuccessful college completion would reduce the odds of well-qualified students forgoing college\nattendance. And finally, I was unable to resist the opportunity to put in a plug for early childhood\nintervention, where research has demonstrated the value of targeted, high-quality programs.\nIn closing, it’s useful to keep in mind the stakes involved in the quality of decision-making on\nhuman capital investments. The breathtaking gains in living standards that have been achieved\nover the last three centuries depended crucially on investments in physical capital. But\naccompanying improvements in workforce skills, broadly defined, were clearly critical as well.\nThe accumulation of knowledge over time is also essential to the process of uncovering and\ndeploying technological innovations that are essential to economic growth. And when we look at\ndisparities in economic outcomes across our populace, differences in human capital\naccumulation loom quite large. Financial education aimed at improving the ability of students\nand families to make sound human capital investment decisions can help us be sure that people\nare prepared to make the best use of their talents and opportunities. As educators, you are on the\nfront line in influencing and preparing our youth. So I would urge you to view your mission as\nabsolutely essential to the continued vitality of economic growth.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Jessie Romero, Kartik Athreya, and Urvi Neelakantan for assistance in preparing these\nremarks.\n2\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "Monetary Policy in the United States: The Risks Associated With Unconventional Policies\n\nSeptember 26, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nSwedbank Economic Outlook Seminar 2013\n\nIn the years since the financial crisis began in 2007, the Federal Reserve and other central banks\nhave taken extraordinary and often unprecedented actions, first in responding as the crisis\nunfolded, and later in trying to adapt policy to the economic conditions that have prevailed since.\nThese actions have involved extraordinary central bank lending, expanding central bank balance\nsheets and banking system reserves, broadening the range of assets purchased, and\ncommunicating about future policy settings.\nWhile such unconventional central bank policies can at times be indispensable in responding to\nunconventional developments in national and global economies, there are accompanying risks\nthat are important to bear in mind. In reviewing these tools and their related risks, it’s helpful to\nbe clear about what constitutes conventional policy, so I’ll start there. Before I do, however, I\nalso should be clear that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of my Federal Reserve System colleagues. 1\nBefore the financial crisis, the typical central bank conducted monetary policy by controlling a\nshort-term nominal interest rate — usually a rate charged in interbank or other wholesale money\nmarket transactions. In the U.S., as in many other countries, this control was accomplished by\nmanipulating the supply of the central bank’s monetary liabilities. Before the crisis, a relatively\nstable, interest-sensitive demand for reserves by U.S. banks arose from the array of regulations\nsurrounding the use of those balances. Legally required reserves were small, and with no interest\nearned on reserves, banks sought to economize on excess reserves. Against this incentive to\nminimize reserve holdings, banks’ demand was supported by the use of reserves in settlement of\ninterbank obligations and by the desire to avoid costly overdrafts. 2\nThe Fed managed the supply of reserves through purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury securities\n— or repurchase transactions in those securities — so that the overnight interest rate in the\nmarket for interbank loans of reserves hit the Federal Open Market Committee’s target. The\nFOMC in turn adjusted its target in response to changes in economic conditions and the\n1\n\n\feconomic outlook so as to achieve low and stable inflation in a manner consistent with its\ncongressional mandate (which also includes the pursuit of maximum employment and moderate\nlong-term interest rates).\nUnconventional Policy\nIn the wake of the financial crisis and the recession that followed, the Fed’s policy has deviated\nin a number of ways from this conventional, precrisis approach — as have the policies of many\nother central banks. During the period from late 2007 through 2008, as the crisis was unfolding,\nthe Fed conducted several emergency lending operations that went beyond the scope of previous\nprecedents. 3 At first, these loans were not allowed to affect the outstanding amount of Federal\nReserve monetary liabilities. This required offsetting sales of U.S. Treasury securities from the\nFed’s portfolio in order to drain reserves and avoid driving the interbank interest rate below the\nFed’s target. These lending operations changed the composition of the Fed’s asset portfolio\nwithout changing the Fed’s monetary liabilities, and thus constituted “credit policy,” not\nmonetary policy. 4 Such lending raises important issues related to the independence of central\nbanks and their role in the financial system. 5 I have spoken at length about these issues on other\noccasions, but they are not my focus today. 6\nAs the economy weakened in the fall of 2008, the Fed drove the interbank interest rate to near\nzero. As a general matter, unconventional monetary policy is associated with the extended period\nof time since then, during which the Fed’s interest rate target has been essentially as low as it can\ngo — in other words, at the “zero lower bound.” The ability of banks and other members of the\npublic to hold currency constrains the ability of the central bank to enforce a nominal interest\ntarget much less than zero. But in an exceptionally weak economy, the appropriate real rate of\ninterest may be negative. A central bank that has credibility for low and stable inflation — so\nthat inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored — will have difficulty making the real\ninterest rate more than a little bit negative.\nOne possible strategy at the zero lower bound is to seek a lower real interest rate by engineering\nan increase in expected inflation, above the rate the central bank would otherwise target. By\ndeparting from its inflation target for a time, a central bank may be able to support economic\ngrowth by lowering the real interest rate, despite not being able to reduce the nominal interest\nrate below zero. Central banks operating at the zero lower bound have generally avoided this\napproach, and for good reason, in my view. In the United States, for example, the process of\nachieving credibility for low inflation was difficult and costly, taking the better part of two\ndecades. This experience suggests that engineering medium-term variations in inflation\nexpectations would be quite difficult to implement and would set precedents that pose longer-run\nrisks to the central bank’s credibility.\nForward Guidance\nSetting aside strategies aimed at changing expected inflation, the Fed and other central banks at\nthe zero lower bound have focused their efforts on longer-term interest rates. They have tried to\nbolster interest-sensitive sectors by reducing long rates to lower levels. Two broad strategies\nhave been employed to attempt to reduce long-term rates: One provides “forward guidance” to\n2\n\n\faffect the public’s beliefs about the future path of policy, including short-term rates, and the\nother relies on direct purchases of longer-term assets.\nThe Fed has deployed a number of approaches to communicating about its intentions and\nexpectations for the path of short-term rates in recent years. The FOMC began by including\nqualitative language in its policy statements characterizing the time period over which it\nexpected exceptionally low interest rates to be appropriate: At first it was “for some time”\n(December 2008 and January 2009), and then “an extended period” (March 2009 through June\n2011). In August 2011, the Committee sharpened its guidance by specifying the time before\nwhich an increase in the federal funds rate seemed unlikely — and then moving this date further\ninto the future several times. Finally, in December 2012, the Committee replaced this date-based\nforward guidance with a threshold for the unemployment rate, saying that “the exceptionally low\nrange for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate\nremains above 6-½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no\nmore than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.” This form of forward guidance\nremains in place today.\nThese communication efforts have been generally aimed at easing financial conditions by\npushing back the dates at which market participants believe short-term rates are likely to rise.\nSuch communications by the central bank, however, inevitably face a conundrum. Forward\nguidance is effective when it alters the public’s perception of the central bank’s pattern of\nbehavior in response to incoming data ― in essence, the central bank’s “reaction function.” But\nthere’s always the possibility that the public will interpret the forward guidance in terms of the\nfuture evolution of the economic conditions to which the central bank reacts. The public might\nreason that, under its existing pattern of behavior, the central bank expects low rates to be\nwarranted for a longer period because they expect the economy to be weaker. In this case,\nforward guidance could have the paradoxical effect of reducing current economic activity, by\nreducing expectations about the level of future economic activity. 7 It may be difficult to craft\nforward guidance in a way that definitively separates these two interpretations. The FOMC’s use\nof numerical thresholds is in part an attempt to clarify that forward guidance about short-term\ninterest rates is about the Committee’s reaction function, not its economic outlook.\nIdeally, a central bank can make clear that its communications concern its future reactions to\nincoming economic data. Forward guidance regarding central bank reaction patterns often takes\nthe form of criteria for particular decisions, as in the case of the FOMC’s thresholds for raising\ninterest rates or the conditions under which the open-ended asset purchase program will likely be\nwound down.\nDesigning such conditional guidance involves trade-offs, however. Credibility requires\nconsistency, over time, between a central bank’s statements and its actual subsequent actions. A\ncentral bank’s statements will have greater immediate effect on the public’s expectations the\nmore they are seen as limiting the central bank’s future choices. Yet there are likely to be\ncircumstances, ex post, in which the central bank feels constrained by past statements. Yielding\nto the temptation to implicitly renege by reworking decision criteria or citing unforeseen\neconomic developments may have short-term appeal, but widely perceived discrepancies\n3\n\n\fbetween actual and foreshadowed behavior will inevitably erode the faith people place in future\ncentral bank statements. So central banks face an ex ante trade-off, as well, between the short-run\nvalue of exercising discretion and the ability to communicate effectively and credibly in the\nfuture.\nAsset Purchases\nThe other unconventional method of influencing longer-term interest rates has been the purchase\nof long-term assets. The Fed has conducted four major rounds of asset purchases since 2009,\nincluding the so-called Maturity Extension Program in which purchases of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities were financed by the sale of shorter-term Treasury securities. The other programs were\nfinanced by creating bank reserves and involved purchases of Treasury securities, as well as\nsecurities issued by the housing-related government sponsored enterprises ― so-called “agency\nMBS.”\nLarge-scale asset purchases are motivated by a desire to have an influence on longer-term\ninterest rates, above and beyond the influence of the public’s beliefs about the path of short-term\nrates. That is, they are designed to act directly on the term premium — that part of a long-term\nrate that is not explained by expected future short rates. By reducing rates in this way, asset\npurchases are intended to stimulate economic activity by encouraging interest-sensitive\ncomponents of spending by businesses and households.\nThe ability of central bank asset purchases to directly lower the term premium presumes some\nsorts of friction in financial markets. Otherwise, any decline in rates would create an arbitrage\nopportunity, and markets would undo the effects of central bank purchases. One type of friction\nthat is often invoked to motivate asset purchases is “market segmentation” — the idea that\ncertain investors have a special attraction for holding certain assets. If, in addition, the ability of\nother traders to arbitrage various market segments is limited by wealth or credit constraints, then\ndifferences in risk-adjusted expected returns could emerge and persist.\nI don’t find this theoretical foundation for the efficacy of central bank asset purchases to be\nparticularly compelling. In modern financial markets, many distinct market segments — for\ninstance, Treasury securities of different maturities — are linked by an array of derivative\ncontracts. An investor with a pure preference for, say, a 10-year bond, should be able to closely\napproximate their desired stream of payments with swaps linked to other securities. The breadth\nand variety of such contracts make it hard to believe that the degree of segmentation is enough\nfor asset purchases to generate significant interest rate effects.\nI also have found the empirical evidence on the effects of asset purchases hard to interpret. Some\nof the evidence, using event study analysis of the effects on long-term rates of announcements\nabout purchase programs, is ill-suited to discerning the kind of persistent effect on rates that\nwould be needed to influence economic decisions. During the short windows over which effects\nare measured, asset price movements can be dominated by transitory market liquidity effects.\nOther studies draw on changes in the net supply of U.S. Treasury securities of varying maturities\nusing data from the years before the crisis, and hence before the Fed undertook a purposeful\nprogram of asset purchases. Finally, when an effect on rates is detected, it’s often difficult to\n4\n\n\fdistinguish direct effects on term premia from effects due to changing expectations of future\nshort rates.\nBeyond the interest rate effects of asset purchases, the effect on real economic activity is even\nharder to detect. One approach has been to combine an estimated interest rate effect with\nestimates from previous work on the effects of long-term interest rates on economic activity. 8\nAnother, more integrated approach is to use rudimentary macro models incorporating the\nsegmented markets ideas mentioned above. 9 Efforts along these lines have found relatively small\nmacro effects of large asset purchases. On balance, my reading of the evidence suggests that the\ndirect economic effects of the Fed’s asset purchases have been minimal.\nThis does not mean, however, that asset purchases can have no effect when the central bank’s\ninterest target is at its zero lower bound. Asset purchases increase reserves, after all, and thus in\nprinciple could induce rapid money growth and rising inflation pressures. Now, however, reserve\nbalances are less than half of the liquidity buffer of the banking system, so at this point the\nreserve expansion has not forced inflationary adjustments in bank’s balance sheets. It’s also the\ncase that market participants thus far do not appear to expect such inflationary consequences.\nIn principle, one can think of asset purchases and forward guidance as distinct policy tools. But it\nhas proven difficult to treat them as such, because announcements about asset purchases at times\nseem to also have had an effect on the public’s beliefs about future interest rate policy. Perhaps\nthis should be expected. Both asset purchases and interest rate settings reflect the central bank’s\nreading of economic prospects. A change in one policy will inevitably be attributed to some\nextent to a change in the central bank’s views on economic conditions, which will in turn be\ninformative about the likely path of the other policy instrument. An example of the difficulty in\nseparating the two instruments could be seen earlier this year when the prospects of winding\ndown the Fed’s asset purchase program appeared to reduce the expected time period over which\ninterest rates were expected to remain near zero. Thus it’s unreasonable to expect\ncommunications about near-term asset programs to have no effect on interest rate expectations,\nunless one believes that the Fed is viewed as having no special expertise in assessing economic\nconditions.\nExit Risks\nWhile I have doubts about whether the effects of the Fed’s asset purchases in the current\nenvironment have been large, I do believe those purchases entail some risks. In particular, I see\ntwo areas for concern. First, our current unconventional policies may make it more likely that we\nact too slowly when it’s time to raise rates, and may make such a delay more costly. And second,\nour large purchases and ongoing holdings of MBS open the door to additional political\ndifficulties for the Fed.\nEven in times of conventional monetary policy, there is a risk that short-term interest rates are\nnot adjusted appropriately, in the sense that later information reveals that rates were too low or\ntoo high in relation to the central bank’s objectives. This risk is an inevitable consequence of our\nimperfect information about the economy. Under normal conditions, the central bank’s\ncredibility for its longer-term inflation objectives helps ensure that the consequences of such\n5\n\n\fpolicy misses are small, as long as they are corrected before too long. My concern is that the\ncombination of forward guidance and a very large balance sheet has raised the likelihood of\npolicy mistakes going forward, and also has raised the cost of such mistakes, should they occur.\nThe forward guidance in recent FOMC statements reads, in part, that “highly accommodative . . .\npolicy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after . . . the economic recovery\nstrengthens.” This wording can reasonably be interpreted as promising or foreshadowing a lower\nlevel of short-term interest rates than our usual policy would dictate. Of course, there is a\nrationale for such commitments in the work of Gauti Eggertsson, Michael Woodford and others,\nbut that work typically does not incorporate the possibility of policy mistakes. If there is any\ncontent to the just-quoted FOMC statement, then surely it indicates a willingness to tolerate a\ngreater risk of keeping rates too low for too long. If that outcome does occur, then the large\nquantity of excess reserves ― $2.2 trillion as of last week ― would allow the banking system to\nexpand quite rapidly, compared to conventional times, when excess reserves were typically less\nthan $2 billion. The quantity of net new deposits the banking system is capable of creating at any\none time (absent Fed accommodation through reserve expansion) is limited by the quantity of\nexcess reserves, after all, and a rapid expansion in bank lending, and thus banking system\ndeposits, would tend to generate inflationary pressures. 10\nThe Fed could, of course, respond to those pressures by raising the interest rate it pays on excess\nreserves. What’s more, the FOMC’s forward guidance about interest rates includes inflation trip\nwires (or “knockouts”), and I believe that the Committee sincerely intends to prevent inflation\nfrom persistently exceeding its 2 percent target. But the uncharted nature of the territory we will\nbe in — with very large reserve balances and forward guidance that specifies necessary but not\nsufficient conditions for raising rates — inevitably raises both the odds of a timing error and the\npotential magnitude of the consequences. The need for vigilance regarding the emergence of\nthese risks suggests that we pay more attention to monetary and bank credit aggregates than we\ntypically do in more conventional times.\nRisks to Independence\nIn addition to expanding the size of its balance sheet, the Fed has altered the composition of its\nasset portfolio through substantial purchases of mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Reserve\nheld $1.4 trillion of agency MBS and debt as of September 18, 2013, or 38 percent of total\nassets. Central bank purchases of unconventional securities have the capacity to generate\npolitical risks because they can be seen as altering the allocation and pricing of credit. I’ve\nmentioned my skepticism about the size of the price effects of asset purchases. Nonetheless, the\nFed’s purchases of agency MBS are clearly intended to reduce their relative yields and lower the\nretail cost of housing credit. If these purchases actually succeed in lowering the cost of housing\ncredit, then the cost of credit to other borrowers will be higher than it otherwise would have been\nhad the central bank instead purchased only Treasury debt.\nWhen a central bank uses its independent balance sheet to choose among private sector assets, it\ninvites special pleading from interest groups and risks entanglement in distributional politics.\nSimilar political risks face a central bank, such as the European Central Bank, allocating\ninvestments across multiple sovereign debt issuers.\n6\n\n\fPolitical pressure to channel credit to favored sectors is not without precedent in the United\nStates. Congress gave the Fed authority to buy the debt of U.S. agencies such as the housing\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises in 1966 in response to the “credit crunch” that year that\nreduced flows to housing finance. 11 At first, the FOMC limited its activities in agency securities\nto short-term repurchase agreements, but Congress pressed the Fed to conduct outright\npurchases, at times explicitly threatening legislation to mandate purchases and reduce the Fed’s\nstatutory independence. In 1971, the FOMC relented and began outright purchases of the debt of\nthe housing government-sponsored enterprises. 12 (By 1981, purchases had stopped, and the Fed’s\nholdings ran off gradually over the 1980s and 1990s. Outright purchases of agency securities\nwere not conducted again until early 2009.)\nHow central banks manage the political risks associated with forays into credit policy may prove\npivotal for the evolution of central banking in advanced economies. 13 A central bank’s core\nresponsibility revolves around its liabilities ― that is, the monetary assets it uniquely supplies.\nBeing organized as distinct, off-budget intermediaries, however, requires them to hold assets,\nand just what assets the central bank should hold has been something of a conundrum. 14 Central\nbank operational independence has been critical to effective monetary policy under the fiat\nmoney standard that has prevailed in the decades since the demise of the gold standard and the\nGreat Inflation of the 1970s. That independence has enabled central banks to generally resist\npressures to provide short-term stimulus that in the past led to bad inflation dynamics.\nOf the risks associated with unconventional monetary policies, those associated with central\nbank holdings of unconventional asset classes may be the most consequential. Violating the\nimplied truce under which central banks avoid credit policy has the capacity to perturb the\ndelicate governance equilibrium supporting the independent conduct of monetary policy. History\nprovides numerous examples of compromised central bank independence leading to calamitous\nmonetary policy.\nConclusion\nMore broadly, the variety of ways in which central banks have ventured into unconventional\nrealms has given rise to a broader set of challenges. Taken as a whole, these unconventional\npolicy measures have elevated the public profile of central banks and spotlighted the breadth of\ntheir statutory authorities. To the extent that the public has been surprised in recent years by the\ndegree of autonomy central banks enjoy and concerned about the efficacy or fairness of their\npolicies, the legitimacy of existing central bank governance arrangements is bound to be called\ninto question. This, I believe, is the most critical challenge that central banks will face in the\nyears ahead.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg, Alex Wolman, Andreas Hornstein, Robert Hetzel, and Huberto Ennis for\nassistance in preparing these remarks.\n2\nSee Huberto M.

Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nChristopher Newport University\nNewport News, Virginia\nThe Federal Reserve, like many other central banks around the world, has been on the hot seat\never since the astonishing events of the financial crisis of 2008. Views about the Federal Reserve\nspan a wide range, from those who would abolish the Federal Reserve outright and return to the\npre-Fed monetary regime that tied the value of money to the value of gold, to those who applaud\nthe institution for heroically preventing a repeat of the Great Depression. In between there are\nthose who propose reforms to the legislation governing the Fed, and others who would leave the\nFederal Reserve Act alone but encourage the Fed to learn the right lessons from the crisis. Why\nthe divergent views? Public debate has focused on the unprecedented interventions in financial\nmarkets and with failing financial firms and the unique operational independence the Fed enjoys\nrelative to other government entities.\nIn our time together, I’ll try to help you understand the current controversies surrounding the\nFed.1 To really understand these controversies, it helps to understand some of our unique\ncharacteristics as a central bank. And to do that, I’ll argue that it’s essential to go back to the\nfounding of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 and learn why we were founded and why we\nwere structured the way we were. It turns out that those who created the Federal Reserve 100\nyears ago wrestled with the same two critical questions that animate debate today: (1) our\nindependence, that is, the structure of our governance and our accountability to the American\npeople, and (2) what sort of assets the Federal Reserve Banks should invest in. These questions\nwere hotly debated when the Fed was founded. I believe that the trade-offs and tensions involved\nare essential for an appreciation of the current debates and how central banking is likely to\nevolve as we enter our second century. Views on these questions differed then, just as views\ndiffer now. In that connection, I should caution that the views I will share with you are my own\nand do not represent the official views of the Federal Reserve System.\nSo let’s cast our minds back 100 years to the signing of the Federal Reserve Act by President\nWoodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913. Why did the founders feel the need to create\nsomething like the Federal Reserve? The short answer they would have given is, “the currency\nproblem,” by which they meant that the supply of currency did not expand and contract\nappropriately with the needs of the economy. This was evident during seasonal increases in the\nneed for money, and during banking panics, when people wanted to withdraw their bank deposits\n1\n\n\fand hold currency instead. When people talked about the Fed’s role in coping with financial\npanics, what they had in mind was expanding the currency supply.\nMoney and Banking Before the Fed\nBut to understand the currency problem, you have to know a little bit about how money and the\nbanking system worked back then. It was different from what we’re used to today. I should warn\nyou that I’ll be discussing some obscure workings of the banking system back then, but I think\nyou’ll see they’re important to the story, so bear with me.\nThe most prominent feature of the U.S. banking system a hundred years ago was that it was\nincredibly fragmented. Laws prevented banks from operating branches, and as a result, there\nwere a large number of individual banks. Banks generally had just one office, and essentially\nevery little town had its own bank. There were nearly 30,000 banks in the United States in 1913.\nLaws limiting branching have gone away, and as a result, there are about 7,000 banks today.\nWhat did people use for money? Coins, for one. They used gold coins, like this beautiful double\neagle. But for small transactions, a gold coin of the right value would be impractically tiny. So\nlarge-value gold coins were supplemented by smaller-valued coins made out of silver or copper.\nFor very large transactions, however, coins were too bulky, and people preferred banknotes.\nBanknotes were paper currency issued by private banks. Here, I have to say a word or two about\nthe National Bank Act, a law passed in 1863, during the Civil War.2 It authorized the chartering\nof “national banks” by the federal government ― up until that time, banks had been chartered by\nthe states, who issued their own paper currency. The 1863 law authorized national banks to issue\npaper notes too, like the ones you see here, and a tax was levied on state bank notes that drove\nthem out of circulation. National bank notes had to be backed by holdings of U.S. government\nbonds. This generated an immediate demand for government bonds, and so it helped finance the\nCivil War ― or, more precisely, one side of the Civil War.\nThe process of issuing national banknotes was somewhat cumbersome. A national bank had to\npurchase the appropriate federal bonds; this was usually arranged through other banks in major\nfinancial centers. The bonds then had to be deposited with the U.S. Treasury, which then\nauthorized the printing of notes by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, using printing plates\nheld by the Treasury. The notes were then shipped to the bank. The difficulty of this process\nplays an important role later in the story.3\nClearing and Settling Interregional Payments\nThe decades between the Civil War and the founding of the Fed saw rapid growth in\ninterregional trade within the United States. Transportation networks were improving rapidly,\nand manufacturers were selling goods around the country. Making large payments at a distance\nposed special difficulties, however. Banknotes were poorly suited for the job because they were\npayable on demand to the bearer, and thus required insurance against theft when shipped. A\nconvenient alternative was the check. If a check was lost or stolen, but someone presented it for\n\n2\n\n\fpayment, the bank could refuse to pay, so checks are to some degree safer than banknotes.\nChecks became the payment instrument of choice in interregional trade.\nTo understand the founding of the Fed, it helps to grasp some of the details of how checks\nmoved around the banking system back then.4 It will help to focus on a concrete example. So\nimagine a general store in Newport News in the 1890s that sells potbellied stoves made by a\nmanufacturer in Brooklyn. The store owner writes a check drawn on his bank in Newport News,\npayable to the manufacturer, and mails it. The manufacturer deposits the check in his account at\nhis Brooklyn bank. (Keep in mind that there wasn’t an iPhone to scan the check into.)\nNow what happens though? How does the Brooklyn bank get paid for the check drawn on the\nbank in Newport News? More generally, how did banks clear and settle checks? Two different\ninstitutional mechanisms developed to facilitate check clearing.\nOne was the clearinghouse.5 Any decent-sized city would have many individual banks, and they\nwould band together in order to economize on the costs of presenting checks to each other for\npayment. Instead of each bank sending clerks directly to each of the other banks, they would\nsend a pair of clerks to a central location. This engraving depicts the New York Clearinghouse\nsome time in the 1850s. (This admittedly is earlier than 1913, but the operations basically looked\nthe same, with the possible exception of the top hats and cutaways.) One clerk from each bank\nwould move around the outside of the circle of desks, presenting bundles of checks in succession\nto clerks from the other banks. The clerk sitting behind the desk would tally the amount of\nchecks presented by the other banks. After the presentation of checks was complete,\nclearinghouse clerks would collate and reconcile all the banks’ tally sheets. At the end of the\nprocess, each bank has either a net obligation due to the clearinghouse, that is to the other banks,\nor else a net obligation due from the clearinghouse. They could either settle up that day, or carry\nover the balance to the next day.\nClearinghouses were an important feature of the banking system, both before the Fed and for\nmany years after. In fact, as I’ll discuss later on, the Federal Reserve Banks were modeled after\nthe clearinghouses of the time, and several of their features were adopted for the Reserve Banks.\nFirst, banks that were members of the clearinghouse were often owed funds by the clearinghouse\n― that is, by other clearinghouse banks. As a result, member banks had a keen interest in each\nother’s financial health. So clearinghouses set standards for membership, required periodic\nfinancial statements and regularly audited their member banks. In other words, clearinghouses\nperformed functions very much like the supervision and regulation now performed by federal\nagencies, including the Federal Reserve. A second key feature of clearinghouses is that they were\nowned by their member banks. A board of directors, chosen by member banks, would set\nclearinghouse policies and rules and oversee the operations of the clearinghouse. Each Reserve\nBank is overseen by its own board of directors.\nClearinghouses worked well in cities, where sending couriers to a central location every day was\nconvenient. But outside the cities, banks were geographically dispersed. Here’s where the second\ninstitutional mechanism used to clear checks comes in. It was called “correspondent banking.”6\nAll the banks outside the cities ― they were called “country banks” ― established relationships\nwith a number of other banks; these were called their “correspondents.” If the country bank\n3\n\n\freceived a check drawn on a distant bank, it would be sent to a correspondent to collect for them.\nSimilarly, if the city correspondent bank received a check drawn on the country bank, they\nwould send it to the country bank for payment. This slide shows a page from a publication that\nlisted each bank and their correspondents. So if you were a bank in Brooklyn, and one of your\ncustomers deposited a check drawn on, say, the First National Bank of Newport News, you\nwould just look them up in this book and find out who their correspondents were. The\ncorrespondents are listed at the bottom of their entry ― I’ve outlined them in a red box. You\ncould send it to the correspondent and get paid for it.\nOne critical feature of this system is that banks kept deposits with their correspondents. So the\nFirst National Bank of Newport News would have accounts with the banks listed at the bottom of\nits entry. These were called “reserve accounts” or just “reserves,” and they played a critical role\nin the banking system. When checks came in to the city bank drawn on the correspondent\ncountry bank, the city bank would subtract (or debit) the amount from the country bank’s\naccount. Similarly, when the country bank sent checks for the city bank to collect for them, the\ncity bank would add (or credit) the amount to its account.\nIf you multiply this picture across the nation, you end up with an intricate web of correspondent\nrelationships linking very small country banks to larger banks in nearby cities to banks in the\nvery largest financial centers ― New York and Chicago. Through this network of relationships,\npeople were able to make payments easily to people at great distances across the United States,\nanalogous to the way electronic payment systems, like the credit card and ATM networks, link\nbanks together in a way that enables payments to flow. The economics are very similar, it turns\nout.\nThe “Currency Problem”\nI have given you an overview of the internal workings of the banking system in 1913, just before\nthe Fed was founded. So what was the problem with this system that motivated the founding of\nthe Fed? One word: inelasticity. At times, the supply of currency just did not expand rapidly and\nflexibly enough. Here’s an illustration of that idea in a cartoon from 1909. Uncle Sam is pictured\nin the foreground, staring forlornly at a sheaf of wheat. His suspenders ― they called them\n“galluses” then ― are labeled “U.S. currency.” His buttons are labeled “financial center.” In the\nbackground, President Teddy Roosevelt explains the problem to a man labeled Congress:\n“You see, those galluses ought to have rubber in them, so that when Uncle Sam stoops to\nmove the sheaf there won’t be much strain on the buttons.”\nTo understand what they were talking about, think of the banking system as a whole; the public\ncan hold bank deposits or banknotes. At times, people prefer more notes and fewer deposits than\nusual. One of those times was the fall harvest season, when more currency was needed to make\nthe payments necessary to move crops to market; picture middlemen needing cash to pay\nfarmers, who then use the cash to pay for supplies or repay loans. The holiday season in\nNovember and December was another time when the demand for currency rose; picture lots of\npeople getting currency out of the bank to go shopping. But remember those cumbersome\nrequirements associated with issuing new banknotes under the National Bank Act. That meant\n4\n\n\fthe banks found it difficult to issue new notes. Country banks would turn to their correspondents\nfor notes to meet the demand for withdrawals, which transmitted the strains to the big financial\ncenters. The banking system had a hard time accommodating the increase in demand for\ncurrency. What was needed was a more elastic supply.\nThose of you who have had an economics class are probably thinking, what about the price\nsystem? Isn’t that how economies deal with scarcity? Well, the workings of the price system\nactually were evident back then. The price of money, as you economics students are aware, is the\nrate of interest ― that’s the opportunity cost of holding noninterest-earning currency, as opposed\nto holding interest-earning assets. Here is a plot (the blue line) of the average interest rate on\ncommercial paper in New York (a good representative financial market interest rate in those\ndays), shown for various months of the year in the 20 years before the founding of the Fed. You\ncan see that from September through December, interest rates were substantially higher, about a\nfull percentage point on average, compared to other months of the year. This is fairly direct\nevidence of the inelasticity that people were concerned about. After the founding of the Fed (the\ngold line), the curve is relatively flat, which is evidence that the Fed was able to better\naccommodate the seasonal swings in the demand for currency.7\nThe inelasticity problem was also evident during financial panics. These were episodes,\ngenerally during economic downturns, in which a sizeable number of people attempted to\nwithdraw their money from banks. In other words, the public wanted to shift out of deposits into\ncurrency. These “bank runs” tended to happen in response to rumors of insolvency at one or\nmore banks. Again, the cumbersome and time-consuming process for issuing new banknotes\nunder the National Bank Act limited the response in the total supply of notes. Interest rates\nwould spike up, as banks attempted to secure banknotes to meet the demand for withdrawals.\nBanks turned to a number of expedients when faced with runs. One response when demand for\nnotes was particularly acute was to “suspend payments,” meaning that banks would refuse to\nallow depositors to withdraw banknotes. At times, clearinghouses would declare suspensions for\nall their member banks. Often deposits weren’t entirely frozen, however. Banks would issue\n“cashier checks” or other instruments that acted as substitutes for currency. These substitutes\nwere viewed as inconvenient stop-gap measures, however.\nEarlier I mentioned that country banks held deposits at correspondent banks. When their\ncustomers’ withdrawals started rising, country banks would ask their correspondent banks for\nshipments of banknotes, to be paid for with their reserve account balances. During financial\npanics, clearinghouse banks would sometimes refuse those withdrawal requests in order to\npreserve cash for themselves.\nThe Panic of 1907 was the last straw; it sparked a concerted national effort to identify\nappropriate reforms to the currency system. Much debate ensued and numerous proposals were\nadvanced, culminating in passage and signing of the Federal Reserve Act in December of 1913.8\nWhat did the Federal Reserve Act do? According to the preamble of the Act, the intent was “to\nfurnish an elastic currency.” That is, they wanted the aggregate supply of currency to be able to\nexpand when the demand for currency rose, as it did during seasonal crop movements and the\nlarge-scale deposit withdrawals associated with banking panics. You’ll also notice that the\n5\n\n\fpreamble says “to afford a means of discounting commercial paper.” I’ll say more about that\nlater.\nThe Federal Reserve Act\nHow would the Federal Reserve furnish an elastic currency? The natural model was the city\nclearinghouses.9 In banking crises, the clearinghouses often issued certificates to be circulated by\ntheir member banks as a substitute for currency withdrawals. (The clearinghouses were not\nlegally entitled to issue bank notes themselves.) Therefore, the Act authorized the establishment\nof a set of banks modeled on the clearinghouses of the day. They called them “federal reserve\nbanks,” because they would hold the reserves of the banking system, instead of having those\nreserves held in the banks in large cities. Reserve banks would have the power to issue notes, just\nas the national banks did at the time, except that the reserve banks would not be subject to the\ncumbersome requirements of the National Bank Act that made the supply of notes so inelastic.\nBecause the reserve banks were modeled after the clearinghouses, it was natural to provide them\nwith the other features associated with clearinghouses. Thus the reserve banks were membership\norganizations, owned and operated by their member banks, much like a joint venture. They were\ngiven authority to examine their members for safety and soundness, just as the clearinghouses\ndid.10 And they were given the power to clear and settle checks for their members as well, a core\nfunction of the clearinghouses.11\nKey Issue: Structure, Governance and Accountability\nPerhaps the most visible aspect of the structure of the Federal Reserve was hotly debated: the\nnumber and location of the reserve banks themselves. One early version of the Federal Reserve\nAct would have created a single reserve bank with branches around the country. This riled\npopulists, however, and tapped into the deep-rooted 19th century American aversion to large\nfinancial institutions and financial center interests. Carter Glass, the congressman from\nLynchburg, Virginia, who chaired the House Committee on Currency and Banking and helped\ndraft the final version of the legislation, insisted on a system of regional reserve banks.\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, however, a leader of the progressive movement, insisted that\nbecause the reserve banks had a substantial public purpose, they should be supervised by a\nfederal agency. So the Act established what is now called the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System to oversee the operations and policies of the reserve banks. The Board also has\nthe power to appoint three of the nine members of each Reserve Bank’s board of directors ― the\nother six are elected by member banks, and only three of them can be bankers. Members of the\nBoard of Governors are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the\nSenate. The Federal Reserve thus was created with a hybrid public-private governance structure.\nThis structure has provided a measure of independence from political pressures that can induce\nan excessively short-run focus. That independence has been valuable, particularly in keeping\ninflation under control. But it comes with a responsibility to be accountable to our democratic\ninstitutions for the results of the conduct of policy.\n\n6\n\n\fThe Fed’s governance structure also was hotly debated during the drafting of the legislation. It\nhas been questioned and amended over the years and remains controversial today. For example,\ncritics have charged that the role of bankers on Reserve Banks’ boards has biased them toward\nthe interests of the banking industry, at the expense of the public interest. Others, however, cite\nthe valuable operational expertise and economic information that bankers bring to the Fed. The\nfinancial reform legislation passed in 2010 in response to the financial crisis ― the Dodd-Frank\nAct ― imposed restrictions limiting the role of bankers in selecting the top officers of the\nReserve Banks.12 More broadly, the Federal Reserve has made significant moves toward greater\ntransparency into its operations and decision-making over the last 20 years. This photo shows a\ngathering of all the Reserve Bank directors and the Board of Governors in October 1914,\nassembled on the steps of the Treasury in Washington. If the analogous group were assembled\ntoday, I can assure you of two things: You’d see greater diversity and fewer hats.\nKey Issue: What Assets Should the Federal Reserve Hold?\nPerhaps the most critical question the founders had to decide was what the Reserve Banks should\nhold as assets. The Federal Reserve notes that were authorized by the Act are liabilities of the\nReserve Banks. The Reserve Banks also accepted deposits from member banks, another liability.\nThe original goal of the founding of the Federal Reserve was to ensure that the quantity of the\nFed’s currency and reserve deposit liabilities would expand elastically when needed. This left the\nauthors of the Act with some discretion as to what assets the Federal Reserve Banks would hold.\nOne asset that was natural to consider was gold, either in the form of coins or bullion. The\ncountry was on the gold standard at the time, and that required that banknotes be convertible into\ngold on demand. The founders decided to mimic the design of other central banks and require\nthat Reserve Banks hold a certain amount of gold ― 40 percent of the value of their notes\noutstanding, and 35 percent of the value of the bank deposits they accepted. This ensured that the\nReserve Banks’ money supply would tend to expand or contract with the movement of gold into\nand out of the country, as required by the rules of the gold standard.\nBut beyond gold, what assets should the reserve banks hold? One option was U.S. government\nbonds. The pre-Fed regime that required backing by government bonds was viewed as\nproblematic, however, for the reasons I’ve already described. In addition, money backed only by\ngovernment bonds was associated with inflationary wartime finance and thus viewed as\npotentially destabilizing. That left private-sector assets. There were active markets for private\nbonds, but these were relatively risky at the end of the 19th century, and stocks were even riskier.\nEuropean central banks at the time, particularly the Bank of England, provided a natural\nalternative model, however. They held financial instruments called “bills of exchange”; similar\ninstruments in the United States were called commercial paper. These were short-term (3- to 6month maturity) obligations that arose out of the financing of trade. Because they were secured\nby goods in transit and endorsed by banks, they were relatively safe. Conservative eligibility\nrequirements and an endorsement by the borrowing bank (a kind of guarantee) helped further\nreduce the risk to the central bank. So the Federal Reserve Banks were given the authority to\nmake loans backed by certain types of commercial paper or purchase certain types of such\ncommercial paper. This is reflected in the third part of the preamble purpose of the Federal\nReserve Act: “to afford a means of rediscounting commercial paper.” They called it\n7\n\n\f“rediscounting,” because the initial loan was essentially the purchase of an obligation at\ndiscount, which reflected an implied interest rate, and the Fed was discounting it a second time.\nDuring World War I, the Reserve Banks were granted the power to hold Treasury securities, and\nthereafter they used purchases of Treasury securities in the open market to influence monetary\nconditions. Acquiring Treasury securities in the open market avoided the cumbersome collateralposting procedure required under the national bank rules. It is important to note that the Fed\ncreates money whether it buys Treasury securities, buys commercial paper or makes a loan.\nWhen a Reserve Bank acquires an asset, it credits the reserve account of the bank of the party\nfrom whom it acquires the asset. When a Reserve Bank makes a loan, it credits the reserve\naccount of the party to whom it is making a loan. In either case, the new reserve account\nbalances can be withdrawn by the bank, and Federal Reserve notes would be paid out, effectively\nconverting the reserve balances into currency. In either case, the supply of currency plus reserves\nhas increased. The key lesson here is that, for the purposes of the original goal of the Federal\nReserve Act ― that is, to solve the currency problem that the Fed was founded to solve and stem\nfinancial panics ― it doesn’t matter whether the Fed lends or buys Treasury securities. Either\none expands the supply of currency and reserves that people are clamoring for.\nThis highlights an important distinction regarding central bank activities. Some actions change\nthe total amount of currency and bank reserves in circulation. These are best referred to as\n“monetary policy.” Actions that change the composition of the central bank’s asset portfolio, but\nleave the amount of currency and bank reserves unchanged can be thought of as “credit policy,”\nsince they involve intervening in credit markets by buying one instrument and selling another.13\nCredit policy has the potential to direct funds to particular sectors or particular private entities,\neither funds they would not otherwise have obtained or on terms they would not otherwise have\nobtained. The “currency problem” that the founders were seeking to solve was a monetary\nproblem, not a credit problem.\nThis distinction is directly relevant to controversies about the Fed’s crisis lending programs,\nbecause they had little to do with monetary policy, in this sense, and thus little to do with the\noriginal goal of the Federal Reserve Act to furnish an elastic currency. Several emergency\nlending programs were introduced early in the crisis, prior to September 2008.14 Lending under\nthese programs was all offset by sales of Treasury securities, so the supply of currency plus\nreserves did not increase. Instead, the lending programs reallocated credit, effectively selling\nTreasury securities to the public and using the proceeds to provide funds to private entities on\nterms they would not otherwise have obtained in the marketplace. Similarly, the loan made in\nconnection with the failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008 was offset through sales of Treasury\nsecurities. Because the Reserve Banks remit all of their excess earnings to the U.S. Treasury, the\nfiscal implications for the federal budget were exactly as if the Treasury had issued new debt and\nmade the loan.\nLater, in the fall of 2008, the Fed drove short-term interest rates essentially to zero and stopped\noffsetting emergency lending. Clearly, though, the Fed could have driven interest rates to zero\nwithout the emergency lending programs by simply buying large quantities of Treasury\nsecurities. Since the crisis, the Fed has dramatically expanded the size of its asset holdings by\nacquiring longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS. The\n8\n\n\fFed could have expanded its portfolio an equal amount through purchases of Treasury securities\nonly. Compared to that benchmark policy, buying agency MBS channels funds to mortgage\nborrowers, financed through sales of Treasury securities to the public.\nIn popular accounts of the crisis, you may have come across references to the Fed as “the lender\nof last resort.” This phrase is often used to describe the prescriptions of Henry Thornton, the\nBritish economist, and Walter Bagehot, a British essayist and journalist. Both men wrote\ninfluential books on central banking: Thornton at the beginning of the 1800s, and Bagehot in the\n1870s. Their recommendations to the Bank of England have been distilled into the phrase: “Lend\nfreely at a high rate on good collateral.”15 This dictum is often invoked to support extensive\ncentral bank lending in episodes of financial distress. But Thornton and Bagehot wrote when\nlending was the primary mechanism by which the Bank of England increased the stock of money\nin circulation. Their writings make clear that they were not recommending rescues for insolvent\ninstitutions, and that their prescriptions were about monetary policy, not credit policy.\nThe Debate Continues: The Future of Central Banking\nSome modern writers instead interpret the “lender of last resort” idea liberally to justify an\nexpansive approach to central banking, in which all available tools, both monetary and credit\npolicy, are used to minimize financial system “disruptions.” They read central bank charters as\nimplying a “financial stability mandate.”16 Although the term “financial stability” was not at all\ncommon 100 years ago, they construe the founders of the Federal Reserve System as motivated\nby a broad desire to minimize and prevent financial panics, even beyond simply satisfying\nincreased demands for Federal Reserve Bank money. The view that financial markets are\ninherently fragile and unstable provides support for this approach.17\nIn contrast, a narrow and more restrained view of central banking emphasizes the critical core\nfunction of managing the monetary liabilities of the central bank.18 Experience after the demise\nof the gold standard in the 1970s has demonstrated that a measure of independence is a critical\ningredient in the success of monetary policy. Aggressive use of a central bank’s asset portfolio to\nchannel credit to particular economic sectors or entities threatens dragging the central bank into\ndistributional politics and places that governance arrangement at risk.19 This more limited\napproach is supported by the view that excessive financial market instability tends to be induced\nby government rescues, and that policymakers should be humble about their ability to identify\nconstructive interventions in particular financial markets.20\nThe evolution of the Federal Reserve, and central banking more generally around the world, will\nbe driven, I suspect, by how the tension between these two approaches plays out. I just hope that\nfuture debates are informed by the rich deliberations that accompanied the founding of the\nFederal Reserve.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Patricia Wescott for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nMilton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz. “A Monetary History of the United States: 1867–1960,”\nPrinceton: Princeton University Press, 1963; Allan H.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, June 2013\nJune 28, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nJudicial Conference of the Fourth Circuit\nWhite Sulphur Springs, W.Va.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to join you in this pleasant setting to discuss the economic outlook. Before I begin,\nI should emphasize that the views expressed are my own and should not be attributed to anyone\nelse in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nLet’s begin with some good news about the economic situation; inflation remains well contained.\nOver the last 12 months, our most reliable measure of prices, the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditure, has risen by only 1 percent. That’s on the low side of our recent\nexperience. Inflation has been fluctuating around 2 percent for two decades now, and just 21\nmonths ago, inflation was 2.9 percent. There appears to be widespread confidence that the\nFederal Reserve will keep inflation low and stable, consistent with our announced inflation goal\nof 2 percent. Indeed, most forecasters view the current readings on inflation to be a temporary\nphenomenon and expect inflation to run at or a little below 2 percent over the next few years.\nHousehold surveys and financial market measures also indicate that inflation is expected to\nremain near its longer-term average. My own view is that the transitory factors depressing\ninflation are likely to ebb, and we’ll see inflation edge back toward the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s target of 2 percent by next year.\nIn contrast to inflation, which over time is determined by central bank actions, real economic\ngrowth and labor market conditions are affected by a wide variety of factors that are outside a\ncentral bank’s control. And it’s real economic conditions that many now view as disappointing.\nTo get a handle on that disappointment, think back to the beginning of the new millennium and\nrecall the pervasive optimism of that time. Much of that optimism was based on experience.\nOver the previous half-century, we had enjoyed remarkable economic performance — real gross\ndomestic product grew at a 3.5 percent annual rate between 1950 and 2000. Since 2000, though,\ngrowth has fallen short of that long-term average. We had a very severe recession in 2008 and\n2009, our worst since the 1930s, and growth has only averaged 2 percent since the end of 2009,\nwell below the longer-run average. Looking ahead, the key question regarding the economic\noutlook is whether growth will remain relatively low. Many forecasters expect growth to pick up\n\n1\n\n\fto over 3 percent next year. I have become increasingly persuaded, however, that low growth\nrates are likely to persist for several years.\nTo see the logic behind this expectation, it is helpful to break GDP growth into two components.\nOne is the growth in employment, and the other is growth in labor productivity, measured as\nGDP per worker. Labor productivity increased at an average rate of 1.8 percent per year from\n1950 to 2000. In this expansion, labor productivity increased rapidly in the last half of 2009, as is\ntypical when coming out of a deep recession. But since then, productivity has been only 0.9\npercent at an annual rate, and thus slower productivity growth is responsible for a significant\nportion of the growth shortfall in this expansion, relative to the late 20th century. Productivity\ngrowth is the consequence of many disparate factors affecting the deployment of innovations,\nincluding research and development, business capital expenditure, regulatory and tax policies,\nlabor force skills and public infrastructure investment. Note that monetary policy is not on this\nlist.\nAfter accounting for productivity growth, the rest of the reduction in GDP growth has been due\nto slower employment growth. Employment grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate from 1950 to 2000.\nEmployment fell dramatically in the recession and its immediate aftermath, but has expanded at\nonly a 1.1 percent annual rate since the end of 2009. It should not be surprising to see relatively\nslow growth in employment now, though, since the number of people of normal working age is\nitself growing slowly. For example, the civilian population aged 16–64 is only growing at a 0.4\npercent annual rate. The part of the population growing most rapidly is above age 65, as aging\nbaby boomers are hitting traditional retirement benchmarks in increasing numbers.\nIn addition to slowing population growth, labor force participation is also falling, even taking age\ninto account. The most dramatic fall has been among young people, aged 16 to 24, whose labor\nforce participation rate fell from over 59 percent in December 2007 to less than 55 percent now.\nBut participation has declined for other age groups as well ― the participation rate of so-called\nprime-age workers, aged 25 to 54, has fallen from 83.1 percent in December 2007 to 81.3\npercent currently. Part of the decline in participation rates could be due to a sluggish overall\neconomic environment. Another part may be due to structural factors such as an expansive safety\nnet. For example, the number of potential workers receiving disability payments has risen almost\n2 percent over the last year. And among young people, falling labor force participation seems\nrelated to higher school attendance, which could be motivated by the secular upward trend in the\nwage gap between educated and less-educated workers. Note that except for the effect of the\neconomy on labor force participation, these factors behind slowing employment growth are also\nindependent of monetary policy.\nTo summarize then, the slow growth in real GDP in this expansion is related to both lower\nproductivity growth and lower employment growth. While economists understand the principles\nunderlying productivity growth, it’s quite difficult to parse the causes of medium-term swings in\nproductivity growth, particularly as they are happening. At this juncture, low productivity growth\nhas persisted long enough that I think the best guess is that it will remain low for an extended\nperiod. Some of the shortfall in employment could be due to the lingering effects of the Great\n2\n\n\fRecession on labor force participation, but at this point, four years since the recession ended, I\ndoubt this effect is very large. I think longer-run structural trends, such as an aging population\nand higher school attendance among young people, are important drivers of the falling\nparticipation rate. And other persistent structural impediments, which I will discuss in a moment,\nseem to be depressing growth as well. Thus, the combination of relatively low productivity and\nemployment growth leads me to conclude that real GDP growth will fluctuate around a 2 percent\ntrend for the foreseeable future.\nThis view, based on medium- to long-run structural factors, contrasts with the views of some\nleading economic forecasters that I mentioned earlier. They believe that after a brief period of\nsluggish growth, real GDP will accelerate significantly. They see growth as being temporarily\nrestrained by “headwinds” that limit spending and will dissipate relatively soon. A few years ago\nI subscribed to that view as well, and I would routinely predict that growth was about to\naccelerate after a quarter or two. Year after year though, our forecasts of acceleration were\nproven wrong, and growth remained near 2 percent. Eventually I started feeling an affinity for\nCharlie Brown, trying time after time to kick the football that Lucy kindly offers to hold for him,\nonly to yank it away. I began to re-examine my basic premise that growth would soon accelerate\nbehind my forecast, and I came to appreciate the structural factors that appear to be persistently\nlimiting growth.\nAlthough growth has averaged 2 percent since the end of 2009, our experience lately has been\nsomewhat choppy, with significant fluctuations above and below 2 percent from quarter to\nquarter. One exception to this choppiness has been housing activity, which is finally on a solid\ngrowth path. New housing starts have more than doubled since the low point in 2009 and have\nrisen by 29 percent over the last 12 months. Home prices are also on an upswing, rising almost\n12 percent on average over the last 12 months. Now I should caution that home building is still\nfar below the levels we saw before the recession, and even below the typical levels of the 1990s.\nMoreover, residential investment is less than 3 percent of GDP, so housing by itself is not going\nto have a large effect on total GDP growth. But having said that, the improvement in housing\nactivity has bolstered the confidence of many households in the market value of their most\nimportant asset.\nRising confidence would be a good thing for consumer spending, which accounts for over 70\npercent of GDP. Over the last 12 months, real consumer spending has risen by 1.8 percent, in\nline with GDP growth and the growth in real personal income. But the increase in federal taxes\nthat took effect in January took a sizable bite out of take-home pay, and real after-tax personal\nincome has risen only 1.1 percent since last year this time. Despite these headwinds, consumer\nspending has held up pretty well so far this year. The more persistent restraint on consumer\nspending in this expansion has been the aftereffects of the income and wealth shocks that hit\nAmerican households during the Great Recession. Memories of these losses have undoubtedly\nmade individuals more cautious about spending commitments. And while consumers have made\ngreat progress restoring some semblance of order to their balance sheets, much remains to be\ndone. For example, close to 20 percent of all residential mortgages are still underwater. So even\n\n3\n\n\fthough consumers have been fairly resilient in recent months, these fundamentals make it hard\nfor me to be bullish about a pickup in consumer spending growth.\nBusiness capital spending, on the other hand, is likely to make a solid contribution to growth\nover the next few years. While investment fell sharply during the recession, new technologies\ncontinued to be developed and improved. There are ample motives to implement these better\ntechnologies, even in the absence of rapid growth. Business fixed investment rose 5-½ percent\nlast year, and most forecasters expect solid growth to continue. I would agree.\nThus the private sector seems to be in reasonably good shape, and if I could stop here, my\ngrowth forecast would be greater than 2 percent. But for completeness, I need to mention other\nimportant factors. First, the federal fiscal outlook is a mess. Last year, the federal deficit\nexceeded $1 trillion and was almost 7 percent of GDP. Projections by the Congressional Budget\nOffice show the deficit declining for several years but then increasing, without bound, as a\nfraction of GDP. That large deficit puts the stock of federal debt on a steep upward trajectory. In\nother words, the current course is unsustainable, and some combination of higher taxes and less\nspending growth is inevitable. It is not clear, however, what adjustments will be made to specific\ntaxes and spending programs. This pervasive uncertainty has undoubtedly affected household\nand business decisions, and it appears unlikely that we’ll soon see a grand bargain that will put\nthe federal budget on a sustainable, long-term path.\nAnother challenge comes from the need for businesses to adapt to the large volume of new\nregulation that has been added in recent years. This is not the place to argue the ultimate merits\nof any particular legislation, but I would simply note that even if net social benefits of new\nregulations are significantly positive, businesses may still face large compliance costs that in turn\naffect hiring and investment decisions. Moreover, many key decisions regarding implementation\nof far-reaching regulations have yet to be made, or fully litigated, I might add. The magnitude of\nthe uncertainty facing firms and households is bound to be elevated relative to the past. For\nexample, we hear often from our contacts that they are worried about how to respond to new\nhealth care requirements, many of which remain to be written. The fiscal sector is clearly a net\nimpediment to growth right now.\nForecasting is nothing if not a humbling endeavor, but rather than say “caveat emptor,” I will\nsupply you with a list of reasons I could be wrong. Medium-term productivity forecasting is\nnotoriously imprecise, as the 1990s demonstrated. Productivity growth could conceivably come\nin stronger over the next few years, and that could pass through to real wage gains that propel\nconsumer spending at a faster rate. Also on the positive side, growth for our major trading\npartners could improve more rapidly than expected, which would boost export demand and\nincomes. Thus I cannot dismiss the possibility that growth will be somewhat better than I expect.\nBut there are also downside risks to the forecast. It is not clear that countries in the Euro area\nhave solved their fiscal and competitive challenges, and thus there is a chance that stagnant\nconditions there prove more persistent, and growth languishes this year and next. Moreover,\nseveral emerging market economies are facing significant challenges right now, and should their\n4\n\n\fadjustments prove more formidable than expected, their growth could suffer. Closer to home,\nimplementation of provisions of the Affordable Care Act later this year could prove highly\nconsequential for hiring incentives, despite whatever benefits it might bring, and thus could\nconceivably slow down job growth around year-end. So one shouldn’t take my outlook for\nmoderate growth for granted, either.\nI should add one important qualification to my portrayal of the economic outlook. At a longer\nhorizon ― that is, the next couple of decades ― I am fundamentally quite optimistic about\nprospects for the U.S. economy. The resilience inherent in our institutional framework, the\nstrength of our great research institutions and the intrinsic capabilities of our workforce all auger\nwell for our capacity to develop and apply the innovations that drive gains in our standards of\nliving over time.\nAt this point in discussing the outlook, you may have noticed that one topic is missing, and so\nI’ll conclude with some thoughts on monetary policy. Federal Reserve policy is exceptionally\naccommodative right now, with short-term interest rates near zero and our balance sheet about\nfour times the size it was before the financial turmoil began in 2007. Moreover, the balance sheet\ncontinues to expand, consistent with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s announcement last week that\nthe Federal Open Market Committee anticipates reducing the pace of asset purchases later this\nyear and ending purchases around mid-year 2014, provided incoming data are broadly consistent\nwith the Committee’s forecast. This means that over the course of the next 12 months, the\nCommittee will be reducing only the pace at which it is adding accommodation. In other words,\nthe Federal Reserve is not only leaving the punch bowl in place, we’re continuing to spike the\npunch, though at a decreasing rate over the next year.\nA highly stimulative policy was the appropriate response to a severe recession of 2008 and 2009,\nin my view. Growth has resumed, however, and it appears as if it’s limited, in large part, by\nstructural factors that monetary policy is not capable of offsetting. In this situation, the benefitcost trade-off for further monetary stimulus does not look promising. I seriously doubt additional\nmonetary stimulus can provide much impetus to real growth right now. But further stimulus does\nincrease the size of our balance sheet and correspondingly increases the risks associated with the\n“exit process” when it becomes time to withdraw stimulus. That is why I have not supported the\ncurrent asset purchase program.\nI did, however, think it wise of Chairman Bernanke to clarify the Committee’s expectations\nregarding how the pace of asset purchases is likely to evolve. Bond and stock markets fell\nsharply in response, but that should not be too surprising. The Chairman’s statement forced\nfinancial market participants to re-evaluate the likely total amount of securities the Fed would\nbuy under this open-ended purchase plan ― in other words, how much liquor would ultimately\nbe poured into the punch bowl. Market participants also had to reconsider their estimate of when\nthe Federal Reserve would begin to remove the punch bowl by raising interest rates. These\nreassessments appear to have warranted price changes across an array of financial assets. As\nmarket participants gain additional insight from the words of Federal Reserve officials or by\npolicy actions in coming quarters, further asset price volatility seems likely.\n5\n\n\fThis type of volatility is a normal part of the process of incorporating new information into\nfinancial asset prices and should not interfere with the moderate-growth scenario that I have\npresented today. And I would emphasize that keeping inflation low and stable is within the\ncapability of any modern central bank. On that score, the recent behavior of inflation has been\nheartening. Measures of inflation expectations remain within ranges consistent with price\nstability, and the low current inflation readings are likely to be transitory. Inflation is likely to\nremain well contained, and that is the single most important contribution a central bank can make\nto economic growth.\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roy Webb for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n6\n\n\f",

            "content": "Statement by\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nbefore the\nCommittee on Financial Services\nU.S. House of Representatives\nWashington, D.C.\nJune 26, 2013\n\nGood morning. I am honored to speak to the Committee about the Dodd-Frank Act and the\npersistence of “too big to fail.”\nAt the outset, I should point out that within the Federal Reserve System, the Board of Governors\nhas sole authority to write rules implementing the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Federal\nReserve Banks supervise financial institutions under authority delegated to them by the Board of\nGovernors. In keeping with Board of Governors guidance, I will not discuss any current or\npotential Federal Reserve rule-making. I also should say that my comments today are my own\nviews and do not necessarily reflect those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or\nmy colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks. 1 My views have been informed by both my\nleadership of the Fifth Federal Reserve District over the last seven years and my experience as a\nresearch economist studying banking policy for the prior 25 years.\nThe problem known as “too big to fail” consists of two mutually reinforcing expectations. First,\nsome financial institution creditors feel protected by an implicit government commitment of\nsupport should the institution face financial distress. This belief dampens creditors’ attention to\nrisk and makes debt financing artificially cheap for borrowing firms, leading to excessive\nleverage and the overuse of forms of debt — such as short-term wholesale funding — that are\nmost likely to enjoy such protection. Second, policymakers at times believe that the failure of a\nlarge financial firm with a high reliance on short-term funding would result in undesirable\ndisruptions to financial markets and economic activity. This expectation induces policymakers to\nintervene in ways that let short-term creditors escape losses, thus reinforcing creditors’\nexpectations of support and firms’ incentives to rely on short-term funding. The result is more\nfinancial fragility and more rescues.\nThe Orderly Liquidation Authority of Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation the ability, with the agreement of other financial regulators, to take a firm\ninto receivership if it believes the firm’s failure poses a threat to financial stability. 2 Title II gives\n\n\fthe FDIC the ability to borrow funds from the Treasury (specifically, the Orderly Liquidation\nFund at the Treasury) to make payments to creditors of the failed firm. The funds are to be repaid\nfrom recoveries on the assets of the failed firm or from assessments against the largest, most\ncomplex financial companies. While the FDIC is to pay creditors no more than they would have\nreceived in a liquidation of the firm, the Act provides the FDIC with broad discretion to pay\nmore. 3 This encourages short-term creditors to believe they would benefit from such treatment\nand therefore continue to pay insufficient attention to risk and invest in fragile funding\narrangements. Given widespread expectations of support for financially distressed institutions in\norderly liquidations, regulators will likely feel forced to provide support simply to avoid the\nturbulence of disappointing expectations. We appear to have replicated the two mutually\nreinforcing expectations that define “too big to fail.”\nExpectations of creditor rescues have arisen over the last four decades through the gradual\naccretion of precedents. Research at the Richmond Fed has estimated that one-third of the\nfinancial sector’s liabilities are perceived to benefit from implicit protection, based on actual\ngovernment actions and policy statements. 4 Adding implicit protection to explicit protection\nprograms such as deposit insurance, we found that 57 percent of financial sector liabilities were\nexpected to benefit from government guarantees as of the end of 2011. This figure was about 45\npercent at the end of 1999.\nA financial system without the broad expectation of government rescues for creditors would\nlikely look different ― potentially quite different ― from the financial system we currently\nhave. Without the expectation of implicit government guarantees, the incentives of market\nparticipants would be better aligned with our public policy goal of a financial system that\neffectively allocates capital and risks. Large financial firms themselves would want to be less\nleveraged and less reliant on unstable short-term funding. Institutions and markets would,\naccordingly, be more resilient in response to financial stress, and policymakers could credibly\ncommit to forgo incentive-corroding rescues.\nThe alternative, accepting the inevitability of an implicit federal backstop and trying to correct\nthe resulting distortions through the regulation of firm size, structure and capital, would lead to\nfar less desirable results, I believe. It would tilt financial innovation toward bypassing regulatory\nconstraints and relying on fragile funding methods that are most likely to elicit government\nprotection. The result would be ever-increasing regulatory costs and repeated bouts of financial\ninstability.\nReducing the probability that a large financial firm becomes financially distressed ― through\nenhanced standards for capital and liquidity, for example ― is useful, but will never be enough.\nThe path toward a stable financial system requires that the unassisted failure of financial firms\ndoes not put the financial system at risk. The resolution planning process prescribed by Section\n165(d) in Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act provides the road map for this journey.\nA resolution plan, or “living will,” is a description of a firm’s strategy for rapid and orderly\nresolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, without government assistance, in the event of\nmaterial financial distress or failure. It spells out the firm’s organizational structure, key\nmanagement information systems, critical operations and a mapping of the relationship between\n2\n\n\fcore business lines and legal entities. The heart of the plan is the specification of the actions the\nfirm would take to facilitate rapid and orderly resolution and prevent adverse effects of failure,\nincluding the firm’s strategy to maintain the operations of and funding for their critical\noperations and material entities.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC can jointly determine that a plan is “not credible” or would\nnot facilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, in which case the firm would be\nrequired to submit a revised plan to address identified deficiencies. A resubmission could include\nplans to change the business operations and corporate structure in order to eliminate deficiencies.\nIf the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not remedy identified\ndeficiencies, they can require tighter capital, leverage liquidity requirements or restrict the\ngrowth, activities or operations of the firm. In essence, regulators can order changes in the\nstructure and operations of a firm to make it resolvable in bankruptcy without government\nassistance.\nThe living will process can address the frequently heard objections to ending government\nrescues. Cooperation between international regulators in a crisis is often cited as an impediment\nto orderly resolution. Forming distinct legal entities for the material overseas operations of\nglobally active firms, with separate capital and liquidity holdings, can solve this problem by\nfacilitating the expeditious sale of material foreign operations and obviating dependence on\ncross-national negotiations about interaffiliate movements in capital and funding.\nThe so-called “liquidity needs” of failing institutions is often cited as a stumbling block to\nresolving financial firms in bankruptcy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code allows the bankrupt firm to\nobtain, subject to court approval, “debtor-in-possession,” or DIP, financing that is generally\nsenior to pre-existing creditors. Such financing can be useful to fund ongoing operations. Other\ncreditors often find it advantageous to approve DIP funding, despite the dilution of their own\nclaims, because it ensures continued access to trade credit. The FDIC’s authority to lend to\ndistressed institutions under its Orderly Liquidation Authority amounts to government-provided\nDIP financing. The beneficial feature of privately provided DIP financing is the presumption\nthat, because it’s provided by market participants but also approved by creditors and the court,\nit’s fairly priced and thus unsubsidized and does not unduly disadvantage any particular class of\ncreditors. Indeed, this is why unassisted bankruptcy is so critical to ending “too big to fail” and\nwhy firms were instructed not to assume extraordinary government support in their resolution\nplans. A financial firm’s liquidity requirements in bankruptcy, however, are a direct function of\ndecisions made prior to entering bankruptcy. A credible living will would include plans for\nfunding critical operations, without government support, throughout the resolution process.\nSome recent proposals to address the “too big to fail” problem would make structural changes to\nfinancial firms ― imposing quantitative limits on their size or prohibiting certain risky activities.\nI am open to the notion that such restrictions may ultimately be necessary to achieve a more\nstable financial system, but I do not believe we have a strong basis yet for determining exactly\nwhat activity and size limits should be adopted. The living will process, however, will provide an\nobjective basis for decisions about how the structure or activities of large financial firms need to\nbe altered in order to assure orderly unassisted resolution. In addition, the process of writing\n\n3\n\n\fcredible living wills would illuminate efforts to identify ways in which the bankruptcy code\ncould be improved to make the resolution of financial firms more orderly. 5\nResolution planning will require a great deal of hard work. 6 But I see no other way to ensure that\npolicymakers have confidence in unassisted bankruptcy and that investors are convinced\nunassisted bankruptcy is the norm. Resolution planning provides the framework for identifying\nthe actions we need to take now to ensure that the next financial crisis is handled appropriately,\nin a way that is fair to taxpayers and establishes the right incentives.\nOnce robust and credible resolution plans are in place, we would be in a position to responsibly\nwind down the Orderly Liquidation Authority and other financing mechanisms, such as the\nFederal Reserve’s remaining 13(3) powers to lend in “unusual and exigent circumstances.” By\nallowing creditors to escape losses, such lending distorts incentives and exacerbates moral\nhazard. Eliminating the ability to provide ad hoc support to firms in financial distress would\ncement our commitment to orderly unassisted resolutions.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this statement.\nFor a comparison of the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions with the U.S. bankruptcy process, see Sabrina R.\nPellerin and John R.

            "content": "Ending ‘Too Big to Fail’ Is Going to Be Hard Work\nMay 9, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nNew York, N.Y.\nThese remarks are abridged from a speech of the same title delivered April 9, 2013, to the\nGlobal Society of Fellows Conference in Richmond, Va.\nIn my opening remarks, I would like to discuss the problem people refer to as “too big to fail.” A\nwide range of reform proposals for dealing with this problem emerged following the crisis of\n2008, many of which were considered in the debate leading up to the Dodd-Frank financial\nregulatory legislation of 2010. Some found their way into the act itself, but that has not put an\nend to the debate. In fact, an array of proposals have garnered attention in recent months, from\nbreaking up large financial institutions to dramatically increasing their capital requirements.\nDespite the diversity of ideas, there appears to be widespread agreement on at least one of the\ngoals of financial reform — ending “too big to fail.” This morning, I would like to discuss some\nwork that I believe is essential to ending “too big to fail.” As always, my remarks today will\nreflect my own views and are not necessarily shared by others in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nBroadly stated, “too big to fail” consists of two mutually reinforcing problems. First, creditors of\nsome financial institutions feel protected by an implicit government commitment of support\nshould the institution become financially troubled. Second, policymakers often feel compelled to\nprovide support to certain financial institutions to insulate creditors from losses. Instances of\nsuch intervention reinforce creditors’ expectations of support and encourage reliance on highly\nliquid funding sources that make such support more likely. Creditor expectations of support, in\nturn, force policymakers to intervene in the event of distress, since disappointing those\nexpectations by withholding support would provoke a sudden, turbulent readjustment of investor\nexpectations regarding support for other, similarly situated firms. Perceived guarantees thus\nencourage fragility, which induces interventions, which encourages further fragility. The result is\nseriously distorted incentives to monitor and control risk and taxpayer-funded subsidies to\nfinancial firms that are widely viewed as deeply unfair.\nTo end “too big to fail,” therefore, we need to bring about two mutually reinforcing conditions.\nThe first is that creditors do not expect government support in the event of financial distress. The\nsecond is that policymakers allow financial firms to fail without government support. If we can\nachieve that commitment and make it credible to market participants, we can improve private\nsector incentives to avoid fragile financing arrangements and limit risk-taking, thereby reducing\nthe pressure for government intervention.\n\n1\n\n\fAllowing a financial firm to fail without government support for creditors does not mean that the\noperations and activities of the failing firm will simply come to an abrupt halt. Outside of the\nfinancial sector, most firms — even relatively large ones — fail by filing for bankruptcy, thereby\ninitiating court-supervised procedures to either restructure obligations and continue operations or\nliquidate assets and distribute the proceeds to creditors. If it proves collectively more valuable to\ncreditors to continue the firm’s operations as a going concern than to liquidate, bankruptcy\nprovides a mechanism for doing so. Indeed, several large airline companies have gone through\nbankruptcy reorganization while continuing regular flight operations. Our goal should be for the\nbankruptcy of a large financial firm to be as much of a nonevent as the bankruptcy of a large\nairline.\nA key provision of Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that bank holding companies larger\nthan $50 billion in assets, as well as certain nonbank financial companies, draw up detailed plans\nfor their orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without government assistance, and submit them to\nregulators. 2 I believe that these resolution plans, also known as “living wills,” represent the most\npromising path toward ending “too big to fail.” Indeed, I believe that without robust and credible\nresolution plans, other financial reform strategies will be incomplete and likely to fall short.\nSome observers see the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s Orderly Liquidation Authority, or\nOLA, as a credible mechanism for resolving financial firms without bailouts. But under the\nOLA, the FDIC can make payments to creditors it deems “necessary,” and it can draw on funds\nfrom the Treasury to do so. 3 Indeed, the FDIC has announced its willingness to do so in some\ncircumstances. 4 This ability, and willingness, opens the door for creditors to believe they might\nbenefit from such treatment and therefore to pay less attention to risk than they should. If\nexpectations of support for financially distressed institutions in orderly liquidation became\nwidespread, regulators would likely feel forced to provide support simply to avoid the turbulence\nof disappointing expectations. We will have replicated the two mutually reinforcing problems\nthat define “too big to fail.”\nMany recent proposals to address the “too big to fail” problem would make structural changes to\nfinancial firms — imposing quantitative limits on their size, for instance, or prohibiting certain\nrisky capital market activities. 5 In my view, it makes perfect sense to constrain the scale and\nscope of financial firms in a way that ensures that they can be resolved in an orderly manner,\nwithout government protection for creditors. But how would you know you have chosen the right\nlimits? Is size alone the issue, and if so, how small should you make them? If activities are the\nproblem, which ones make them hard to resolve? And how do you know you haven’t gone too\nfar and sacrificed valuable efficiencies that may derive from the current industrial organization\nof the financial system?\nThe only approach I can envision to answering such questions is resolution planning — that is,\nthe hard work of mapping out in detail just what problems the unassisted bankruptcy of a large\nfinancial firm as it’s currently structured might encounter. Such maps would provide an objective\nbasis for judgments about how the structure or activities of such firms need to be altered in order\nto give policymakers the confidence to choose unassisted bankruptcy in the event of distress, but\nwithout going too far and unnecessarily eliminating efficiencies associated with economies of\nscale and scope.\n2\n\n\fThe Dodd-Frank Act requires that bank holding companies larger than $50 billion in assets, as\nwell as nonbank financial companies supervised by the Fed, submit resolution plans annually to\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC. 6 A final rule implementing this provision was announced by\nthe Fed and the FDIC in October 2011. A plan, or “living will,” is a description of a firm’s\nstrategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. It must contain a detailed description of the firm’s organizational\nstructure, key management information systems, critical operations and a mapping of the\nrelationship between core business lines and legal entities. The heart of the plan is specification\nof the actions the firm would take to facilitate rapid and orderly resolution and prevent adverse\neffects of failure, including the firm’s strategy to maintain operations of and funding for their\nmaterial entities. Firms are required to provide analysis under the three economic scenarios —\n“baseline,” “adverse” and “severely adverse.” Plans may not rely on the provision of\nextraordinary support by the U.S. government.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC can jointly determine that a plan is not credible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, in which case the firm would be\nrequired to submit a revised plan to address identified deficiencies. A resubmission could include\nplans to change the business operations and corporate structure in order to eliminate deficiencies.\nIf the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not remedy identified\ndeficiencies, they can require higher capital, leverage liquidity requirements or restrict the\ngrowth, activities or operations of the firm. In essence, regulators can order changes in the\nstructure and operations of a firm to make it resolvable in bankruptcy without government\nassistance.\nRegulators last year required the first round of submissions from the largest U.S. firms and\nforeign-based companies with significant U.S. assets. 7 These plans reflect considerable effort by\ncovered companies to address requirements of the resolution plan rule. Through the process of\ndeveloping the plans, firms have deepened their understanding of their own complex legal entity\nstructures, their financial and operational interconnectedness, as well as the vulnerabilities that\nmay arise in their resolution.\nThe living wills program will require more hard work and detailed analysis. But I see no other\nway to reliably identify exactly what changes are needed in the structure and operations of\nfinancial institutions to end “too big to fail.” I see no other way to achieve a situation in which\npolicymakers consistently prefer unassisted bankruptcy to incentive-corroding intervention and\ninvestors are convinced that unassisted bankruptcy is the norm.\nIt is essential that we eliminate the government backstop implied by “too big to fail.” Ambiguous\ncommitments induce fragilities that in turn induce intervention that expands implied\ncommitments. Richmond Fed economists estimated that, at the end of 1999, about 45 percent of\nfinancial sector liabilities were explicitly or implicitly government guaranteed. At the end of\n2011, as a result of the precedents set during the crisis, they estimated the figure to have grown\nto 57 percent. 8 This fraction is likely to continue to grow unless we end “too big to fail.” And to\nend “too big to fail,” we need to do the hard work of learning what it takes to make all firms safe\nto fail without government rescues.\n3\n\n\f1\n\nI am grateful for assistance from John Weinberg in preparing these remarks.\nSee section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n3\nFunds paid in excess of what a creditor would have received in bankruptcy must be recovered from the\ndisposition of the failed firm’s assets, or if this amount is insufficient, from clawing back any additional payments\n(payments beyond what would have been received in a liquidation) made to creditors, and if that is insufficient, by\ntaxing all large bank holding companies and other systemically important financial institutions. See section 210(o)\nof the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act.\n4\nSee remarks by Martin J. Gruenberg, acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago Bank Structure Conference, May 10, 2012. Gruenberg stated: “The new resolution\nauthority comes with access to a new source of liquidity support provided by the Dodd-Frank Act: the Orderly\nLiquidation Fund, or OLF, located in the Treasury Department. The OLF must either be repaid from recoveries on\nthe assets of the failed firm or from assessments against the largest, most complex financial companies. Taxpayers\ncannot bear any loss from the resolution of a financial company under the Dodd-Frank Act. The OLF does address a\ncritical issue to prevent a system-wide collapse, as we saw with the Lehman bankruptcy, because it provides an\nemergency source of liquidity to allow the bridge financial company to complete transactions that provide real\nvalue and prevent contagion effects. While the OLF can be a source of direct funding for the resolution, it can also\nbe used to provide guarantees, within limits, on the debt of the new company.”\n5\nSee, for instance, Richard W.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, May 2013\nMay 3, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nRisk Management Association, Richmond Chapter\nRichmond, Va.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to address the Richmond Chapter of the Risk Management Association once\nagain. We’ve typically held this event on a cold, blustery January day. Shifting the date to early\nMay puts us in the midst of a truly wonderful springtime in Richmond this year. Our landscape is\ngraced now with an abundance of dogwoods and azaleas in full bloom, which makes it hard not\nto feel a bit more optimistic about the world. I’ll be discussing economic conditions, however,\nand they call economics the dismal science for a reason; so my description of the outlook may\ncontrast with the cheery thoughts inspired by our magnificent spring. Nevertheless, I will argue\nthat our situation is not as dismal as many would have you think, and the economic landscape\ndoes have its attractive elements. Before I begin, I should emphasize that the views expressed are\nmy own and should not be attributed to anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nI’ll start with some good news about the economic situation; inflation remains well contained.\nOver the last four quarters, our most reliable measure of prices, the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditure, has risen 1.2 percent. That’s on the low side of our recent experience.\nInflation has been fluctuating around 2 percent, and just a year and a half ago, inflation was 2.8\npercent. There is widespread confidence that the Federal Reserve will keep inflation low and\nstable, consistent with our announced inflation goal of 2 percent. 2 Indeed, most forecasters\nexpect inflation to run at or a little below 2 percent over the next few years, and household\nsurveys and financial market measures also indicate that inflation is expected to remain near its\nlonger-term average. One local example of this confidence was the announcement by The\nCollege of William and Mary that tuition charges would remain fixed over a student’s entire\nfour-year term, which suggests some assurance that inflation will be held in check. My own view\nis that inflation is likely to begin to edge back toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) target of 2 percent by next year.\n\n1\n\n\fIn contrast to inflation, which over time is determined by central bank actions, real economic\ngrowth and labor market conditions are affected by a wide variety of factors outside a central\nbank’s control. And it’s real economic conditions that many view as disappointing lately.\nTo get a handle on that disappointment, think back to the beginning of the new millennium and\nrecall the pervasive optimism of the time. Much of that optimism was based on past experience.\nFor example, over the previous half-century we had enjoyed remarkable economic performance\n— real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 3.5 percent annual rate between 1950 and 2000.\nSince 2000, though, growth has fallen short of that long-run average. We had a very severe\nrecession in 2008 and 2009, our worst since the 1930s, and growth has averaged 2.1 percent\nsince then, well below the longer-run average. Looking ahead, the key question regarding the\neconomic outlook is whether growth will remain relatively low, or will instead return to rates we\nsaw in the last half of the 20th century.\nThis is an active area of economic research, and would make a suitable topic for a university\nseminar, or perhaps a massive open online course. So I won’t attempt to be comprehensive, but I\ndo want to take a closer look at a few of the features of the post-recession economic expansion\nthat distinguish it from our pre-2000 growth experience.\nFirst, let’s break down GDP growth into two components. One is the growth in employment and\nthe other is growth in labor productivity, measured as GDP per worker. Labor productivity\nincreased at an average of 1.8 percent per year from 1950 to 2000. In this expansion, labor\nproductivity increased rapidly in the last half of 2009, as is typical when coming out of a deep\nrecession. But since then the trend in productivity has been only about 1 percent at an annual\nrate, which has contributed to the slowness of the expansion. Slower productivity growth\ntherefore is responsible for a significant portion of the growth shortfall in this expansion, relative\nto the late 20th century. Productivity growth is the consequence of many disparate factors,\nincluding research and development, business capital expenditures, labor force skills and public\nsector infrastructure investment. Note that monetary policy is not on this list.\nSetting aside labor productivity growth, the rest of real GDP growth is attributable to the growth\nin labor inputs. Employment grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate from 1950 to 2000. Employment\nfell dramatically during the recession and its immediate aftermath, but has expanded at only a 1.1\npercent annual rate since the end of 2009. So a significant portion of the growth shortfall is\nattributable to slower growth in employment.\nMovements in employment have been mirrored by movements in unemployment. During the\nrecession the unemployment rate — the fraction of the labor force that is out of work — rose\nfrom 5.0 percent in December 2007 to 10.0 percent in October 2009. During this expansion, the\nunemployment rate has fallen to a level of 7.6 percent as of March of this year, a pace of seventenths of a percentage point per year. This is faster than the pace at which unemployment fell in\nlast two business-cycle expansions. Thus, this expansion resembles other recent expansions in\nthe pace at which we’ve been able to reduce the pool of unemployed workers.\n\n2\n\n\fThe unusual feature of this expansion, relative to our 20th century experience, is the evolution of\nthe size of the labor force. The fraction of the working age population that is either working or\nactively looking for work — economists call this the labor force participation rate — rose\nsteadily from 1950 to 2000, as women entered the work force in ever larger numbers, and\nimproving health allowed people to work later in life. Since 2000, labor force participation has\nfallen significantly, from a peak of over 67 percent to a rate of 63.3 percent as of March. Much\nof that decline has occurred since the Great Recession. Thus understanding people’s decisions\nabout whether to participate in the labor force is essential to understanding the economic\noutlook.\nOne obvious explanation for the decline in labor force participation is that workers are\ndiscouraged by adverse labor market conditions. Weak GDP leads to a weak demand for labor,\nand poor job prospects can keep some people from even looking for work. This effect was\npronounced during the Great Recession, given the magnitude of the increase in unemployment.\nBut a good deal of time has passed since the recession, and the unemployment rate has come\ndown significantly. Moreover, labor force participation was affected by demographics and other\nstructural factors even before the recession, and these trends have continued and perhaps\nintensified since then.\nOne development that stands out is the sharp fall in the labor force participation of young people.\nIn December 2007, the participation rate for people aged 16 to 24 was 59.2 percent. It fell during\nthe recession, and since then has fallen further; it now stands at 54.5 percent. One might hope\nthis simply reflects more young people pursuing higher education, or possibly students devoting\nmore time to their studies, and there is some evidence to support that hypothesis. This may\nreflect difficulty finding desirable entry-level jobs, a by-product of weak economic growth. But\nit also may reflect a response to the widening wage premium associated with higher levels of\neducation, a broader structural factor that is unlikely to be reversed rapidly.\nAt the older end of the labor market, a basic demographic fact is that over the last decade the\nbaby boom generation has begun entering an age range in which labor force participation\ntypically falls. Thus an increasing fraction of the labor force is in these low-participation-rate\ndemographic groups. As the baby boomers continue to age, this will continue to pull down\noverall labor force participation rates over time. 3\nTurning to the middle of the age distribution, economists who study labor markets often label\nworkers aged 25 to 54 as the “prime working age” population. This group is characterized by\nhigh-participation rates, generally good health, and relatively high productivity, and they play a\nkey role in economic growth. In recent years, the baby boomers have been aging out of the prime\nworking age population, and smaller cohorts have been entering. Back in the 1980s this group\nwas growing by about 2-¼ percent annually, but by the late 1990s growth had fallen below one\npercent per year. The absolute size of the prime working age population has shrunk each year\nsince 2008.\n\n3\n\n\fIn addition to that demographic challenge, participation rates for the prime working-age\npopulation also have fallen, declining from 84 percent in 2000 to 81.4 percent in 2012. While\nweak economic activity could account for some of this decline, other secular trends may be at\nplay.\nTo summarize then, the slow growth in real GDP in this expansion is related both to lower\nproductivity growth and to the decline in labor force participation. Some of the shortfall could\nreflect the lingering effects of the Great Recession on labor force participation. But longer-run\nstructural trends, such as our aging population and the changing schooling decisions of young\npeople, also seem to be playing an important role. If so, we need to adjust to the implication that\nGDP growth will continue to fluctuate around a 2 percent trend for the foreseeable future.\nWith that long-term perspective in mind, we can turn our attention to the latest data and what we\nmight expect over the next year or two. In recent quarters we’ve seen a seesaw pattern, with\ngrowth looking fairly strong for a few months, but then looking fairly weak for a few months.\nFor example, real GDP grew at a 0.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, but is estimated to\nhave grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter.\nOne exception to the choppiness is that housing activity is finally on a solid growth path. New\nhousing starts have more than doubled since the low point in April 2009, and have risen by an\nespecially rapid 47 percent over the last 12 months. Home prices are also on an upswing, rising\nalmost 10 percent in the last 12 months. Now I should caution that residential investment is only\n2.6 percent of GDP, so that housing by itself is only making a modest contribution to overall\nGDP growth. But the improvement in housing activity does seem to have bolstered households’\nconfidence in the market value of their most valuable asset.\nAnd that leads to the outlook for consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of GDP.\nOver the last four quarters, real consumer spending has risen by 2.0 percent, in line with real\nGDP. But real disposable personal income has only risen by 0.9 percent over those same four\nquarters, which raises an obvious concern over the viability of the spending growth. The slow\ngrowth in spending in part reflects sluggish compensation growth; for example, average hourly\nearnings have only risen 1.8 percent over the last 12 months, barely ahead of inflation. Another\nfactor that lowered take-home pay is the increase in federal taxes that took effect in January.\nMore broadly, the breadth and depth of the income and wealth shocks that hit American\nhouseholds during the Great Recession are undoubtedly adding to their cautious attitudes. Such\nmemories are unlikely to fade rapidly, so it’s hard to be very bullish on the outlook for consumer\nspending.\nBusiness capital spending is likely to make a sizeable contribution to growth over the next few\nyears. Not surprisingly, investment fell sharply during the recession, but technological advances\nhave continued to provide ample motive for new investment, even in the absence of rapid GDP\ngrowth. Companies appear to be finding ways to improve effectiveness by deploying new\ntechnologies. Business fixed investment rose 5.5 percent last year and most forecasters expect\nsolid growth this year and next.\n4\n\n\fDespite these bright spots in residential and business investment, there are some important\nchallenges that are holding back growth and deserve mention. First, the federal fiscal outlook is a\nmess. Last year the federal deficit exceeded $1 trillion, and was 6.9 percent of GDP. Projections\nby the Congressional Budget Office show the deficit declining for several years but then\nincreasing, without bound, as a fraction of GDP. That large deficit puts the stock of federal debt\non a steep upward trajectory. In other words, the current course is unsustainable, and some\ncombination of higher taxes and less spending growth is inevitable. It’s not clear, though, when\nand by how much any particular tax will increase. It’s also not clear when and by how much any\nparticular spending program will be cut back. This pervasive uncertainty has undoubtedly\naffected business and household decisions, and it appears unlikely that we’ll soon see a grand\nbargain that will put the federal budget on a sustainable, long-term path.\nAnother challenge for the U.S. economy is Europe. The Euro area is in recession, as are other\ncountries; one result is a weak demand for U.S. exports. Several European countries have fiscal\nimbalances that appear to be unsustainable. Moreover, several European countries have unit\nlabor costs well above the German level, making many of their industries uncompetitive and\nshrinking. While there have been dramatic crises in Greece and Cyprus, the fiscal and\ncompetitive challenges are clearly more widespread. At this time it’s hard to see how the\nstruggling countries can return rapidly to a persistent growth path with a sustainable fiscal\npolicy. And it’s difficult to project much growth for Europe as a whole until these problems in\nthe Euro area are healed.\nYet another challenge comes from the need for firms to adapt to the large volume of new\nregulation that has been added in recent years. This is not the place to argue the ultimate merits\nof any particular legislation, but simply to note that even if net social benefits of new regulations\nare significantly positive, businesses may still face large compliance costs that in turn affect\nhiring and investment decisions. Moreover, many key decisions regarding implementation of farreaching regulations have yet to be made, and this uncertainty is another factor affecting firms\nand households. Banks, for example, are worried about new regulations on mortgage lending that\nhave not yet been finalized. A wide range of businesses are worried about how to respond to new\nhealthcare requirements, many of which have not yet been written.\nLet’s take a step back and survey the landscape. Prospects for housing and business investment\nare strong, but uncertainty about fiscal and regulatory policy in the U.S. and economic activity in\nEurope are an offsetting drag on growth. Consumers are cautious, understandably so given what\nthey’ve been through, and are unlikely to drive a spending surge. Adding it all up, the economy’s\ncurrent trend rate of GDP growth appears to be around 2 percent. We are likely to see brief\nswings above and below that rate from time to time, but I don’t see a compelling case for a\nsustained departure any time soon. That’s a change for me; like most other forecasters I’ve been\nlooking for GDP to significantly accelerate a year or two down the road. But I would add that\nwhen I think about the challenges our economy is facing, 2 percent growth actually looks like a\nfairly good outcome. It represents significant forward momentum and sustained real income\n\n5\n\n\fgains. It also demonstrates the resilience of an economy that has weathered a huge shock in the\nmost recent recession and is back on a solid growth track, despite an array of obstacles.\nI’ll end with a few thoughts on monetary policy. Federal Reserve policy is exceptionally\naccommodative right now, with short-term interest rates near zero and our balance sheet at about\nfour times the size it was before financial turmoil began in 2007. A highly expansive policy was\nan appropriate response to a severe recession, I believe. Growth has resumed, however, and it\nappears as if it’s limited, in large part, by structural factors that monetary policy is not capable of\noffsetting. In this situation, the benefit-cost trade-off associated with further monetary stimulus\ndoes not look promising. The Fed seems to be unable to improve real growth, despite striving\nmightily over the last few years, and further increases in the size of our balance sheet raise the\nrisks associated with the “exit process” when it’s time to withdraw stimulus. This is why I do not\nsupport the current asset purchase program.\nKeeping inflation low and stable is within the capability of a modern central bank. On that score,\nthe recent behavior of inflation has been heartening. Measures of inflation expectations remain\nwithin ranges consistent with price stability, and the low current readings on some inflation\nindices are likely to be transitory. Well-contained inflation, the most fundamental contribution a\ncentral bank can make to economic growth, seems likely to continue.\nThank you for your attention, and I would be happy to take any questions.\n1\n\nI am grateful for assistance from Roy Webb and Andreas Hornstein in preparing these remarks.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” News and Events,\nMonetary Policy Press Release, January 29, 2013. 2013.\n3\nThis has been offset somewhat by the increase in participation rates for people aged 65 and older.\n2\n\n6\n\n\f",

            "content": "Ending ‘Too Big to Fail’ Is Going to Be Hard Work\nApril 9, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nUniversity of Richmond\nRichmond, Va.\n\nLet me start by welcoming the Global Interdependence Center to Richmond, Va., and by\nthanking them for the invitation to speak with you this morning. My topic concerns the\nrelationship between the financial sector and the public sector in the United States. The financial\ncrisis of 2007–08 exposed fundamental flaws in that relationship, and a wide range of reform\nproposals subsequently emerged, many of which were considered in the debate leading up to the\nDodd-Frank financial regulatory legislation of 2010. Some found their way into the act itself, but\nthat did not put an end to debates about finance and government in our postcrisis world. Indeed,\nan array of proposals have garnered attention in recent months, from breaking up large financial\ninstitutions to expanding existing government backstops to a broader range of financial market\nactivities. While many ideas have been put forth, there appears to be widespread agreement on at\nleast one of the goals of financial reform ― ending “too big to fail.” This morning, I would like\nto discuss what I believe needs to be done to end “too big to fail.” As always, my remarks today\nwill reflect my own views and are not necessarily shared by others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem. 1\nThe phrase “too big to fail” has become something of an all-purpose descriptor for problems\nafflicting financial markets. It’s actually a bit of a misnomer, though, because of the multiple\nmeanings of the word “failure.” One might think that protecting a firm from failure means\nprotecting shareholders from losses. But the incentive problems associated with the phenomenon\nwe call “too big to fail” stem more from the protection of creditors. A firm could “fail” in the\nsense that its equity is wiped out and management of the firm’s operations is removed, but if\ncreditors expect government support that limits their losses, then their incentive to avoid risk will\nbe severely depressed. A firm that can borrow with implicit government guarantees will find\ndebt to be relatively inexpensive and will be more highly leveraged than if its debt were fairly\npriced.\nBroadly stated, “too big to fail” consists of two mutually reinforcing problems. First, creditors of\nsome financial institutions feel protected by an implicit government commitment of support\nshould the institution become financially troubled. Second, policymakers often feel compelled to\n1\n\n\fprovide support to certain financial institutions to insulate creditors from losses. Instances of\nsuch intervention reinforce creditors’ expectations of support and encourage reliance on highly\nliquid funding sources that make such support more likely. Creditor expectations of support, in\nturn, force policymakers to intervene in the event of distress, since disappointing those\nexpectations by withholding support would provoke a sudden, turbulent readjustment of investor\nexpectations regarding support for other, similarly situated firms. Perceived guarantees thus\nencourage fragility, which induces interventions, which encourages further fragility. The result is\nseriously distorted incentives to monitor and control risk and taxpayer-funded subsidies to\nfinancial firms that are widely viewed as deeply unfair.\nTo end “too big to fail,” therefore, we need to bring about two mutually reinforcing conditions.\nThe first is that creditors do not expect government support in the event of financial distress. The\nsecond is that policymakers allow financial firms to fail without government support. If we can\nachieve that commitment and make it credible to market participants, we can improve private\nsector incentives to avoid fragile financing arrangements and limit risk-taking, thereby reducing\nthe pressure for government intervention.\nAllowing a financial firm to fail without government support for creditors does not mean that the\noperations and activities of the failing firm will simply come to an abrupt halt. Outside of the\nfinancial sector, most firms ― even relatively large ones ― fail by filing for bankruptcy, thereby\ninitiating court-supervised procedures to either restructure obligations and continue operations or\nliquidate assets and distribute the proceeds to creditors. If it proves more valuable to creditors,\ncollectively, to continue the firm’s operations as a going concern than to liquidate, bankruptcy\nprovides a mechanism for doing so. Indeed, several large airline companies have gone through\nbankruptcy reorganization while continuing regular flight operations.\nA key provision of Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that bank holding companies larger\nthan $50 billion in assets, as well as certain nonbank financial companies, draw up detailed plans\nfor their orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without government assistance, and submit them to\nregulators. 2 In my remarks, I will discuss the work currently underway on these resolution plans,\nalso known as “living wills.” I will argue that resolution planning represents the most promising\npath toward ending “too big to fail.” Indeed, I believe that without robust and credible resolution\nplans, other financial reform strategies will be incomplete and likely to fall short.\nWe Didn’t End ‘Too Big to Fail’\nMuch of the financial reform agenda since the crisis has focused on enhancing the supervision of\nlarge financial firms, with the goal of reducing the probability that they experience financial\ndistress. For example, regulators have implemented enhanced capital and liquidity standards for\nso-called “systemically important financial institutions.” Through the capital stress test process,\nregulators regularly assess whether firms’ current and planned capital positions would prove\nadequate under plausible adverse scenarios. These and other supervisory enhancements are\nessential to containing moral hazard and improving financial stability.\nWhile capital levels at large U.S. financial firms have improved, some critics argue that\nsubstantial further increases in capital requirements are warranted. 3 Higher capital ratios, all else\n2\n\n\fconstant, would reduce the probability that a financial firm incurs losses large enough to make it\ninsolvent. One clear lesson of the financial crisis, in my view, is that capital ratios at large\nfinancial firms were inadequate. But another lesson of the financial crisis is that we need some\nattention as well to what actually happens in the event that a large financial firm becomes\ninsolvent, as rare as that may be. Once a firm’s capital has been eroded, the fact that it had higher\ncapital before being hit by shocks is of little comfort. The complexity of modern financial firms\nand the resulting apprehensions about the consequences of their unassisted failure motivated the\nwide array of government and Fed actions taken during the financial crisis. The anticipation of\nthose responses can have powerful incentive effects in normal times. Because we are unlikely to\nraise capital levels high enough to completely eliminate the possibility of financial failure, it’s\nessential that we be prepared to handle such failures, should they occur.\nSome observers argue that the problems associated with resolving a large or complex financial\ninstitution have largely been addressed. In particular, they point to the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp.’s Orderly Liquidation Authority, or OLA, as credible mechanism for resolving financial\nfirms without bailouts. This portion of the Dodd-Frank Act, Title II, gives the FDIC the\nauthority, with the agreement of other financial regulators, to take a firm into receivership if it\nbelieves the firm’s failure poses a threat to financial stability. 4 Many provisions of Title II mirror\nprovisions of the bankruptcy code, and in winding down a firm under the OLA, the FDIC is to be\nguided by what various claimants would be estimated to receive in a bankruptcy proceeding. But\nthe FDIC does have the ability to deviate in some important ways from what might occur under\nbankruptcy. In particular, it can make payments to creditors it deems “necessary,” and it can\ndraw on funds from the Treasury to do so. 5 Indeed, the FDIC has announced its willingness to do\nso in some circumstances. 6 This ability, and willingness, opens the door for creditors to believe\nthey might benefit from such treatment and therefore to pay less attention to risk than they\nshould. If expectations of support for financially distressed institutions in orderly liquidation\nbecame widespread, regulators would likely feel forced to provide support simply to avoid the\nturbulence of disappointing expectations. We will have replicated the two mutually reinforcing\nproblems that define “too big to fail.”\nWhat to Do?\nThis feature of the implementation of Title II ― that it recreates the capabilities and incentives\nthat originally gave rise to excessive government rescues ― motivates the view that more needs\nto be done in order to truly end “too big to fail.” Many recent proposals to address the problem\nwould make structural changes to financial firms ― imposing quantitative limits on their size,\nfor instance, or prohibiting certain risky capital market activities. 7 In my view, it makes perfect\nsense to constrain the scale and scope of financial firms in a way that ensures that they can be\nresolved in an orderly manner, without government protection for creditors. But how would you\nknow you have chosen the right limits? Is size alone the issue, and if so, how small should you\nmake them? If activities are the problem, which ones make them hard to resolve? And how do\nyou know you haven’t gone too far and sacrificed valuable efficiencies that may derive from the\ncurrent industrial organization of the financial system?\nThe only approach I can envision to answering such questions is resolution planning ― that is,\nthe hard work of mapping out in detail just what problems the unassisted bankruptcy of a large\n3\n\n\ffinancial firm as it’s currently structured might encounter. Such maps would provide an objective\nbasis for judgments about how the structure or activities of such firms need to be altered in order\nto give policymakers the confidence to choose unassisted bankruptcy in the event of distress, but\nwithout going too far and unnecessarily eliminating efficiencies associated with economies of\nscale and scope. In addition, the process of writing credible living wills would illuminate efforts\nto identify ways in which the bankruptcy code could be improved to make the resolution of\nfinancial firms more orderly. 8\nLiving Wills\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires that bank holding companies larger than $50 billion in assets, as\nwell as nonbank financial companies supervised by the Fed, submit resolution plans annually to\nthe Federal Reserve and the FDIC. 9 A final rule implementing this provision was announced by\nthe Fed and the FDIC in October 2011. A plan, or “living will,” is a description of a firm’s\nstrategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material\nfinancial distress or failure. It must contain a detailed description of the firm’s organizational\nstructure, key management information systems, critical operations and a mapping of the\nrelationship between core business lines and legal entities. The heart of the plan is specification\nof the actions the firm would take to facilitate rapid and orderly resolution and prevent adverse\neffects of failure, including the firm’s strategy to maintain operations of and funding for material\nentities. Firms are required to provide analysis under the three economic scenarios stipulated in\nthe Board of Governors capital stress test analysis ― “baseline,” “adverse” and “severely\nadverse.” Plans may not rely on the provision of extraordinary support by the U.S. government.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC can jointly determine that a plan is not credible or would not\nfacilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, in which case the firm would be\nrequired to submit a revised plan to address identified deficiencies. A resubmission could include\nplans to change the business operations and corporate structure in order to eliminate deficiencies.\nIf the Fed and the FDIC jointly determine that the revised plan does not remedy identified\ndeficiencies, they can require higher capital, leverage liquidity requirements or restrict the\ngrowth, activities or operations of the firm. In essence, regulators can order changes in the\nstructure and operations of a firm to make it resolvable in bankruptcy without government\nassistance.\nRegulators last year required the first round of submissions from the largest U.S. firms and\nforeign-based companies with significant U.S. assets. 10 These plans reflect considerable effort by\ncovered companies to address requirements of the resolution plan rule. Through the process of\ndeveloping the plans, firms deepened their understanding of their own structure and operations,\nas well as the vulnerabilities that may arise in resolution. The plans have provided improved\ninsight into the workings of firms, including their complex legal entity structures, financial and\noperational interconnectedness across the different affiliates, and those critical operations that are\ncrucial to financial stability. These insights are being used to enhance supervision more broadly\nand promote industry best practices.\nThe process of constructing a set of robust and credible living wills must be iterative. Because of\nthe magnitude of the planning efforts required, it made sense to have streamlined requirements\n4\n\n\ffor the initial round of submissions; for example, firms were asked for analysis under just one\neconomic scenario, rather than three. First-round submissions have provided valuable lessons\nlearned, both for covered firms and for supervisors, about areas where further analysis is needed.\nRegulators intend to provide feedback to these firms to help guide subsequent rounds of\nsubmissions. Over time, our collective understanding of how the unassisted resolution of a large\nfinancial entity works will deepen. Armed with that understanding, we can bolster policymakers’\nconfidence in the plans through appropriate preparations, including structural changes in the\nnature and organization of the business operations of financial firms. This confidence can move\nus closer to the day when bankruptcy is as much of a nonevent in finance as it is in the airline\nindustry.\nHard Work Ahead\nSeveral critical challenges must be addressed, however, for the living wills project to succeed.\nOne relates to globally active financial firms with interdependent entities in different national\njurisdictions. Achieving an orderly resolution of such a firm can be difficult, because regulatory\nauthorities in different jurisdictions may be concerned primarily with the continuity of operations\nand taxpayer impact in their own country. 11 One approach to this problem is to require globally\nactive firms to form distinct legal subsidiaries, with separate capital and liquidity holdings, to\nconduct material overseas operations, so that they can be resolved separately in the event of\ndistress. 12 The ability to expeditiously sell material foreign operations would provide valuable\nflexibility and would obviate dependence on cross-national negotiations about interaffiliate\nmovements in capital and funding. Widespread use of subsidiarization could well impose\nadditional operational costs on such firms or limit their ability to shift capital among affiliates. If\nsubsidiarization is what it takes to make a resolution plan credible, however, then the resulting\nburden to private firms should be viewed as a measure of the subsidization attributable to their\n“too big to fail” status. This is a good example of the types of trade-offs that the living wills\nwork will help us understand.\nSubsidiarization has potentially broader uses in the preparation of living wills. One simple\napproach to resolution is for the highest-level parent company to file for bankruptcy, treating all\nthe (domestic) affiliates as part of a single concern. This parallels the FDIC’s announced\nintention to handle resolutions under its OLA through a “single point of entry.” At the same time,\nhowever, we should devote ample effort to being able to sell off significant subsidiaries as standalone entities where that might make good economic sense. This might mean investing ahead of\ntime in distinct operational infrastructures or in writing service agreements that would survive\nthe bankruptcy of one affiliate. We should not assume that “all hands go down with the ship” in a\nsingle-point-of-entry scenario, when preparing sturdy lifeboats might make better sense.\nPerhaps the most critical challenge for resolution planning concerns funding. The U.S.\nBankruptcy Code allows the bankrupt firm to obtain, subject to court approval, “debtor-inpossession,” or DIP, financing that is generally senior to pre-existing creditors. Such financing\ncan be useful to fund ongoing operations — for example, to pay off certain creditors, such as\nvendors, rather than retain them in bankruptcy proceedings. Other creditors often find it\nadvantageous to approve DIP funding, despite the dilution of their own claims, because it\nensures continued access to trade credit. The FDIC’s authority to lend to distressed institutions\n5\n\n\funder its OLA amounts to government-provided DIP financing. The beneficial feature of\nprivately provided DIP financing is the presumption that, because it’s provided by market\nparticipants but also approved by creditors and the court, it’s fairly priced and thus unsubsidized\nand does not unduly disadvantage any particular class of creditors. Indeed, this is why unassisted\nbankruptcy is so critical to ending “too big to fail,” and is why firms were prohibited from\nassuming extraordinary government support in their resolution plans.\nFor large financial firms, creating a credible funding plan that avoids adverse effects, without\nresorting to government DIP financing, might seem daunting, given their scale and the limited\nobserved size of private DIP financing to date. 13 The scale of a firm’s potential liquidity need,\nhowever, is heavily influenced by how it manages liquidity prior to experiencing financial\ndistress. Just as operational obstacles to an orderly resolution can be remedied by reorganizing\noperations ahead of time, funding challenges that would otherwise arise in the bankruptcy of a\nlarge financial firm can be contained through appropriate changes in liquidity management in\nnormal times.\nOne might worry that the changes in liquidity management required to render a resolution plan\ncredible without government-provided DIP financing might squelch socially beneficial maturity\ntransformation. One should also be concerned, however, that “too big to fail” has resulted in a\nsocially excessive scale of maturity transformation, since the associated fragility is more likely to\nelicit government support to protect creditors than intermediation that does not involve maturity\ntransformation. In my own view, the latter should be our dominant consideration in the wake of\nthis crisis.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, it’s vitally important that regulators work together to ensure the adoption of robust\nand highly credible resolution plans for large financial institutions. The financial industry also\nhas an interest in ending “too big to fail” and thereby strengthening reliance on market discipline,\nbecause the alternative implies an ever-expanding blanket of safety and soundness regulations\nthat threatens to smother the ability to offer useful financial products and services.\nThe living wills program will require a great deal of hard work and detailed analysis. But I see\nno other way to reliably identify exactly what changes are needed in the structure and operations\nof financial institutions to end “too big to fail.” I see no other way to achieve a situation in which\npolicymakers consistently prefer unassisted bankruptcy to incentive-corroding intervention and\ninvestors are convinced that unassisted bankruptcy is the norm.\nCredible living wills may require significant changes for financial firms. They could lead to\nmore capital, less complex relationships among affiliates and perhaps even to smaller firms.\n“Too big to fail” is unsustainable. Ambiguous implied commitments induce fragilities that in\nturn induce intervention that expands implied commitments. Richmond Fed economists\nestimated that, at the end of 1999, about 45 percent of financial sector liabilities were explicitly\nor implicitly government guaranteed. At the end of 2011, as a result of the precedents set during\nthe crisis, they estimated the figure to have grown to 57 percent. 14 This fraction is likely to\n\n6\n\n\fcontinue to grow unless we end “too big to fail.” And to end “too big to fail,” we need to do the\nhard work of learning what it takes to make all firms safe to fail without government rescues.\n1\n\nI am grateful for assistance from John Weinberg in preparing these remarks.\nSee section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n3\nSee Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig, “The Banker’s New Clothes: What’s Wrong with Banking and What to Do\nabout It,” Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2013.\n4\nFor a comparison of the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions with the bankruptcy process, see Sabrina R.\nPellerin and John R. Walter, “Orderly Liquidation Authority as an Alternative to Bankruptcy,” Federal Reserve Bank\nof Richmond Economic Quarterly, First Quarter 2012, vol. 98, no. 1, pp. 1-31.\n5\nFunds paid in excess of what a creditor would have received in bankruptcy must be recovered from the\ndisposition of the failed firm’s assets, or if this amount is insufficient, from clawing back any additional payments\n(payments beyond what would have been received in a liquidation) made to creditors, and, if that is insufficient, by\ntaxing all large bank holding companies and other SIFIs. See section 210(o) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\nand Protection Act.\n6\nSee remarks by Martin J. Gruenberg, acting chairman of the FDIC, to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Bank\nStructure Conference, May 10, 2012. Gruenberg stated: “The new resolution authority comes with access to a new\nsource of liquidity support provided by the Dodd-Frank Act: the Orderly Liquidation Fund, or OLF, located in the\nTreasury Department. The OLF must either be repaid from recoveries on the assets of the failed firm or from\nassessments against the largest, most complex financial companies. Taxpayers cannot bear any loss from the\nresolution of a financial company under the Dodd-Frank Act. The OLF does address a critical issue to prevent a\nsystem-wide collapse, as we saw with the Lehman bankruptcy, because it provides an emergency source of\nliquidity to allow the bridge financial company to complete transactions that provide real value and prevent\ncontagion effects. While the OLF can be a source of direct funding for the resolution, it can also be used to provide\nguarantees, within limits, on the debt of the new company.”\n7\nSee, for instance, Richard W.

            "content": "Economics and the Federal Reserve After the Crisis\nFebruary 12, 2013\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nFranklin & Marshall College\nLancaster, Pa.\n\nThe invitation to address you this evening is a great honor for me. I matriculated in 1973, filled\nwith a sense of awe and anticipation about the world of learning that was opening up before me.\nLittle did I know that I was in for an intense period of personal growth and discovery as well.\nBut just as important, it was here at Franklin & Marshall College that I made the choices that\nwould set the course of my professional work for decades to come. I am very grateful to F&M\nfor all it provided me.\nMy topic tonight is “Economics and the Federal Reserve After the Crisis.” F&M is where I first\nseriously studied economics, so that seems appropriate as a subject. The financial crisis of 2007–\n08 had significant consequences, to say the least, and the Federal Reserve was at the center of it\nall. So I thought I would share some reflections with you. But as I have thought back on those\nevents in the intervening years, a vivid memory from my F&M days comes to mind. It was not\nfrom an economics class but a seminar in the government department — International Politics, I\nbelieve it was called, with Professor Robert Gray. We spent some time studying the Cuban\nmissile crisis, and I believe we read Graham Allison’s book, 1 which was popular at the time. One\nbroad insight I took away from the course was that a critical influence on the choices made by\npolicymakers was the theory they brought to the table — their conceptual understanding of the\nfundamental forces at work in the world they are dealing with. Moreover, it is often the case that\nseveral plausible alternative theories are also available to policymakers.\nSince the recent financial crisis, I have reflected often on the role of economics in shaping the\npolicy response. 2 There is no substitute for theorizing about how the world works because there\nis no other way to form a judgment about whether a given policy action will be good or bad. To\nput it another way, if you think you know how a policy intervention might work in the world,\nyou have a theory in mind. The challenge for policymakers, particularly for central bankers these\ndays, is choosing which theories to place weight on. One can search for appropriate models by\ncomparing alternatives to real-world observations, but at times a given set of observations is\nconsistent with several different models. Sometimes additional observations can be found that\ndiscriminate between contending theories, but if not, policymakers may be forced to choose\nbetween competing theories.\nIn recent years, a trove of new, previously classified information about the Cuban missile crisis\nhas been released, including transcripts of recordings President John F. Kennedy secretly made\n1\n\n\fof his meetings with his top advisers, the Executive Committee of the National Security Council.\nThese have shed new light on the thinking of the president’s policy advisers during this critical\nepisode. Our understanding of the financial crisis is similarly benefiting from the emergence of\nnew, previously classified information. The Federal Open Market Committee, the policymaking\narm of the Federal Reserve, releases transcripts of its meetings and conference calls with a fiveyear lag. On January 18 of this year, the transcripts were posted for 2007, the year the financial\nmarket turmoil began. 3 These records of the FOMC’s deliberations provide a fascinating window\ninto policymakers’ thinking as the crisis began to unfold.\nPopular accounts of the financial crisis focus heavily on the events that took place later, in the\nfall of 2008. Indeed, much of the media coverage of the release of the transcripts focused on the\nextent to which the Committee did or did not appear to predict exactly what was just around the\nbend. The critiques of Monday morning quarterbacks are entertaining, to be sure, and I agree that\nthe events of the fall of 2008 had their roots in what happened in 2007 and earlier. But it’s\nultimately unproductive to act as if policymakers should have been omniscient. The transcripts\nshow Committee participants grappling with how to interpret what was happening and what to\ndo about it. Alternative assessments were plausible, given the information that was available in\nreal time, although each had different implications for how the future might unfold.\nIn my remarks tonight, I would like to provide an overview of what economics had to offer to\npolicymakers as the financial crisis began to unfold in 2007. A wide variety of research over the\nlast couple of decades was directly relevant to financial market instability, and I do not intend to\nsurvey it all. But, at the risk of oversimplification, I will highlight two broad alternative views\nthat have emerged, each with significantly different implications for the handling of the crisis. In\n2007, the transcripts show that one was chosen, and it guided the diagnosis and prescriptions of\nsenior Fed policymakers for the rest of the crisis. Indeed, that view has had a major influence on\nthe legislative and regulatory responses designed to prevent future crises. Before I begin with an\noverview of these two views, I need to warn you that my remarks reflect my own views and not\nnecessarily those of other Federal Reserve officials. If you have any doubt, the 2007 transcripts\nconfirm this assertion. 4\nAlternative Theories\nThe banking system was obviously at the heart of the crisis, and economists have made a good\ndeal of progress in recent decades on the theory of banking. The essence of what it means to be a\nbank is the use of short-term funding to invest in longer-term assets, a process called “maturity\ntransformation.” Traditionally this would take the form of loan portfolios funded through the\nissuance of deposits. Immediately demandable deposits are a short-term liability, unlike bank\nloans that are repaid over a number of years. Maturity transformation by financial intermediaries\nprovides the benefit of insurance to depositors who might quickly need their funds — to\npurchase goods and services, for example, or to pursue an unanticipated investment opportunity.\nBy pooling the funds of many such investors, a bank can make a set of longer-term investments\nthat individual investors on their own would view as too risky to support.\nMaturity transformation involves a potential risk of its own, however. If a large number of\ndepositors sought to withdraw their deposits simultaneously, the bank might have trouble raising\n2\n\n\fenough funds through liquidating its asset holdings. As a result, a firm with a mismatched\nbalance sheet is vulnerable to a “run,” in which people try to get their money out before the firm\nis no longer able to make immediate payment. Even though it may be individually rational, such\na run can cause damage by inducing the untimely liquidation of bank assets.\nIn economists’ terms, what I’ve just described is a situation subject to “multiple equilibria.” One\npossibility (equilibrium) is that depositors run, even if they don’t need their money now, because\nthey expect other depositors are running as well. The other possibility is that depositors don’t\nwithdraw unless they truly need their money because they expect others to behave similarly. One\nway to prevent the possibility of the bad outcome is to provide government-backed insurance to\nthe depositors. In fact, in the simplest versions of this theory, such insurance has almost magical\npowers. The mere presence of the backstop commitment makes depositors confident that other\ndepositors won’t be heading for the exits — with the result that people only take their funds out\nwhen they really need to. The magical aspect is that the government backstop is never actually\nused.\nThis intuition may seem pretty easy to grasp, but it wasn’t until 1983 that two economists —\nDouglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig — published an article laying out this logic in a precise,\nrigorous fashion. 5 This insight has had a tremendous influence on economists’ thinking about\nbanking and financial markets. And as I’ll discuss, their portrayal of inherent financial fragility\nhas had a tremendous impact on policy during the crisis and beyond.\nGovernment-supplied deposit insurance has always been understood to carry its own risks,\nhowever. In the late 1970s John Kareken and Neil Wallace pointed out that deposit insurance\ncreated incentives that could lead to socially excessive risk-taking. 6 Banks that can raise insured\ndeposits have less incentive to avoid large losses, and their depositors have less incentive to\nmonitor and constrain such risk-taking, because taxpayers could end up holding the bag. Thus,\ndeposit insurance was paired with a system of comprehensive regulatory oversight. Indeed, such\noversight is today a major function of the Federal Reserve System and other bank regulators and\nis a significant responsibility of Reserve Banks like Richmond’s.\nRegulation comes with its own implications, of course. In this context, one of the most important\nis the incentive it provides market participants to perform functionally equivalent services just\nbeyond the reach of regulations, effectively by-passing those regulatory constraints. This gives\nrise to what’s called “shadow banking” — bank-like activities conducted outside the legal\nconfines of the banking industry. One example of shadow banking is the market for repurchase\nagreements, or “repos,” in which a lender purchases an asset from a borrower with a\nsimultaneous agreement to resell it at a later date, often the next day. Maturity transformation is a\nkey feature of the repo market and contributed to the demise of Bear Stearns in 2008.\nBut a government backstop is not the only mechanism for preventing self-fulfilling runs. The\nlikelihood of such behavior also can be influenced by the details of the contracts between the\nbank and its depositors. For instance, if the arrangement includes conditions under which the\nbank can suspend depositors’ right to withdraw, then the self-fulfilling run outcomes also can be\naverted. Such a practice was common during U.S. financial panics in the 19th century, before the\nadvent of government deposit insurance. Banks would suspend withdrawals, for exactly the\n3\n\n\fpurpose of interrupting the dynamics of an emerging bank run. This type of mechanism reduces\nsomewhat the services provided by the deposit but in the interest of altering incentives and\nensuring the sustainability of the overall arrangement, much the way high insurance deductibles\nimprove the sustainability of insurance coverage.\nClose attention to contractual details like the ability to suspend payments highlights an important\npoint in the study of financial institutions and their behavior. Financial contracts are not one size\nfits all — they vary dramatically across various settings and sectors. For example, equity\ncontracts have long been an important source of finance for some groups, such as small high-tech\nstartups, while in other settings, simple debt is more dominant.\nEconomists have made progress in understanding which financial contracts are best adapted to\nwhich settings using the tools of a branch of economics known as mechanism design. 7 These\ntools allow you to ascertain the extent to which a given contract is consistent with opportunistic\nbehavior by trading partners, taking into account that they may have superior information and\nmay be able to take actions you cannot observe. In a famous example, over 30 years ago the\neconomist Robert Townsend showed that in certain settings a plain-vanilla debt contract is\nexactly the optimal contract, in the sense that no other form of financial contract would make the\nborrower or lender better off without making the other one worse off. 8 The same logic applies to\nfinancial institutions, such as banks, which can be thought of as a complex multilateral array of\ncontracts. Equally famous work by the economist Doug Diamond showed that in certain settings\nbanks do better than a system of bilateral lending. 9\nMechanism design, as an approach to understanding financial markets, emphasizes the\nendogeneity of contracts and institutions. It takes into account in a systematic way the various\nfrictions and transactions costs that make borrowing and investing challenging, such as limits to\nthe information of various parties or the inability to precommit to future actions. It builds on the\nnotion that contracting parties choose the form of contract for their mutual benefit. Mechanism\ndesign provides a way to understand and predict how financial contracts and institutions might\nadapt and evolve in response to changes in their economic environment.\nOne important part of the economic environment to which private financial institutions and\ncontracts adapt is the set of rules imposed and actions taken by the government in its interactions\nwith financial markets. Take, for instance, the two means of preventing the inefficient, selffulfilling bank runs that I discussed earlier. One relies on the expectation of government support\nin the event of financial stress. The other relies on the incentives of market participants to adopt\ncontractual arrangements that are as robust as possible to potential stresses. But the private\nincentives that drive this second approach depend on what people believe about the likelihood of\ngovernment support in the event of a crisis. If they believe such support is likely, then their\nincentive to adopt more resilient arrangements is weaker.\nThe interaction between government backstops and endogenous financial arrangements poses a\nvery general problem for policymaking. If we observe financial institutions or markets that are\nvulnerable to runs, it could reflect inherent fragility, or alternatively it could reflect expectations\nof government support that short circuit the incentive to adopt more robust arrangements.\n\n4\n\n\fAs policymakers entered 2007, the economics literature offered them two broad but\nfundamentally different views of the world — two theories of financial instability. One tends to\nview market institutions and contracts as relatively fixed and the resulting financial system as\ninherently prone to the type of instability depicted by the simple model of bank runs. Under this\ntheory, an expectation of government support may be necessary to make crises less likely,\nalthough that support necessitates regulatory oversight and constraints on banks to replace the\nmarket discipline that is lost when counterparties feel protected by government guarantees.\nIn the alternative view, private financial arrangements are themselves adaptable and endogenous.\nMuch of the vulnerability observed in financial markets is itself the induced response of market\ninstitutions and behaviors to the expectation of government backstop support in the event of\ndistress. In the absence of that expectation, there would be stronger incentives to seek more\nrobust arrangements.\nSo on the eve of 2007, policymakers were faced with two broad, competing views on the origins\nof financial market fragility — either it was inherent in the structure of financial arrangements,\nor it was induced by expectations of government support.\nThe Backstory\nBefore discussing the policy debates of 2007, it’s worth briefly reviewing the lead up to the\ncrisis. Three threads course through this backstory. The first consists of the instances of financial\nstress that recur from time to time in U.S. history. There were significant panics in the second\nhalf of the 19th century in which investors sought to convert their deposits into currency. Bank\nfailures were widespread at the start of the Great Depression, when deflation made it hard for\nborrowers to repay fixed-dollar debts. Bank failures were small and isolated in the 1950s and\n1960s but began growing in size and frequency in the 1970s. Inflation and subsequent regulatory\nforbearance led to widespread failures among savings and loan institutions in the 1980s.\nForbearance also extended to large, money center institutions, which were hammered by losses\non loans to less developed countries in the 1970s and 1980s.\nOfficial government support is the second thread in this backstory. The founding of the Federal\nReserve in 1913 gave the Fed the capacity to act as a public sector backstop to banks — a\n“lender of last resort” — in the event of a run. Despite this there were widespread bank failures\nin the Great Depression. The associated losses of deposit savings by households and firms\nprompted tighter restrictions on bank activities and the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp., or FDIC. 10\nThe third key feature of the backstory is the increasing frequency, starting in the 1970s, of\ngovernment support being extended beyond the official scope of deposit insurance. This\ninvolved a series of successively larger institutions, including the noteworthy Continental Illinois\nin 1984, which prompted Congressional testimony that saw a senior federal bank regulator\nacknowledge that the largest 11 banks would not be allowed to fail without government\nassistance. 11 This was the first public articulation of the notion of “too big to fail.”\n\n5\n\n\fOther actions, beyond traditional banking, also contributed to the perception of an implicit\ngovernment commitment to dampen financial instability, most notably the handling of the\ncollapse of Penn Central in 1970, the response to the stock market crash of 1987 and the\nresponse to financial distress at Long-Term Capital Management in 1997.\nThis history created a situation at the beginning of this century in which it was widely\nacknowledged that a large fraction of our financial system was believed to be backed by explicit\nor implicit government guarantees. 12 In fact, in 2002 at the Richmond Fed we estimated that, as\nof the end of 1999, the share of financial sector liabilities likely to benefit from government\nprotection was about 45 percent. Out of this, 27 percent was explicit protection, while the\nremaining 18 percent was implicit. 13\nAugust 16, 2007\nTurning to the crisis itself, the story should be more familiar. As home prices crested and began\nto decline in many markets in late 2006 and early 2007, the cumulative rates of default on the\nmost recent vintage mortgages began to rise precipitously, particularly for loans with\nnonstandard features — low credit scores, low down payments and minimal documentation, for\ninstance. The clear implication was that that the ultimate loss rates on those mortgages were\ngoing to exceed original expectations by a significant margin. Most of these loans had been\nsecuritized and sold, which dispersed the risk across the financial system. In early 2007, several\nfirms involved in originating and securitizing such loans experienced financial distress, and some\nfailed. The FOMC transcripts for 2007 show that as the housing market worsened — and strains\nemerged in housing finance — Committee participants actively discussed the likely magnitude of\nthe fall out for the rest of the economy.\nHousing-related financial market turbulence came to a head in August 2007, particularly in the\nmarket for asset-backed commercial paper, or ABCP. These securities were backed by the\nissuer’s holdings of a variety of assets, including mortgage-backed securities of various types. A\nsponsoring financial firm — typically a large commercial or investment bank — would transfer a\nportfolio of assets into a separate legal entity, which in turn would issue the commercial paper.\nAs the incoming housing market data called into question the value of mortgage-backed\nsecurities, the spread between interest rates on ABCP and interest rates on comparable Treasury\nsecurities began to rise. As maturing paper came due, some sponsoring firms took the underlying\nassets back onto their own balance sheets, and the volume of ABCP issued fell dramatically. 14\nWith more banks turning to the unsecured interbank markets for funding, interest rates there rose\nsignificantly on August 9 and 10.\nIn this environment the Fed took its first official action in response to the financial crisis. The\nFOMC typically sets a target value for the federal funds rate — the rate at which banks lend to\neach other in the overnight market. For many years the interest rate that the Federal Reserve\nBanks set on their discount window loans to banks had been set at a fixed margin of one\npercentage point over the federal funds rate target. On a videoconference call the evening of\nAugust 16, the FOMC decided to lower that spread to one half of a percentage point.\n\n6\n\n\fThis move reflected a judgment that deteriorating conditions in the ABCP market were creating\nstrains in the banking system that, without an expansion of Fed lending, threatened to reduce the\nsupply of credit to the rest of the economy. The problem was compounded, in this view, by the\nstigma that banks seemed to associate with the Fed’s discount window — the idea that if\ncounterparties found out that you borrowed from the window, they might downgrade their\nassessment of your creditworthiness. 15 Announced at 8 a.m. the morning of August 17, the Fed’s\ndiscount rate reduction — from 6-1/4 percent to 5-3/4 percent — was meant to encourage more\nborrowing. Later that morning Fed officials spoke with a group of bankers and urged them not to\nthink of borrowing from the Fed as a sign of weakness. The following week, the four largest U.S.\nbanks borrowed from their discount windows on a coordinated basis to demonstrate the propriety\nof borrowing from the Fed.\nThe diagnosis underlying the actions taken in August 2007 set the direction for policy\nprescriptions as the financial crisis unfolded; central bank credit would be used to alleviate\nstrains in an inherently fragile financial system. When the flow of borrowing from the Fed\nseemed to remain relatively low even after the discount rate reduction, the Fed introduced new\nprograms to push more credit out to the banking system, beginning with the Term Auction\nFacility, or TAF, in December 2007. This was followed by the rescues and an array of lending\nprograms introduced over the course of 2008.\nAt the time of the August 2007 discount rate cut, I questioned the presumption that the markets\nwere suffering from a problem for which increased Fed credit was the solution. An alternative\ndiagnosis of the situation was that the deterioration in housing market conditions was causing a\nfundamental revaluation of housing-related financial instruments. Because exposures to this\nrevaluation were distributed throughout the financial system, uncertainty about the\ncreditworthiness of counterparties had increased substantially, and this caused investors to\ndemand higher-risk premiums in compensation. For ABCP sponsors, bringing assets back onto\ntheir balance sheet was often less costly than paying elevated premiums to investors. This\nexplained the reduced volumes in the ABCP market, but it required raising funds from other\nsources, such as the interbank market, which in turn contributed to the observed volatility and\nelevated interest rates on the interbank market. The ABCP market didn’t “seize up,” under this\ninterpretation, it simply moved elsewhere.\nAnother source of additional bank funding in August 2007 was the Federal Home Loan Banks.\nThese institutions are government-sponsored intermediaries that lend to their member banks.\nBecause they are viewed as likely to be rescued by Congress in the event of distress, they\ngenerally can borrow from institutional investors at very favorable terms and pass on the funding\nadvantage to their borrowers. Lending by the Home Loan Banks surged by $110 billion during\nthe turmoil in August 2007 because they charged interest rates that were well below those\ncharged by the Fed. Indeed, when the Fed began to auction off credit in the TAF, a large share of\nthe borrowings was taken by foreign banks, which did not have access to Home Loan Bank\nfunding.\nEvidence from research conducted since 2007 is consistent with the notion that increases in\ncounterparty credit risk drove the financial market turmoil that August. A study by Daniel M.\nCovitz, Nellie Liang and Gustavo A. Suarez showed that the extent to which counterparties\n7\n\n\fpulled away from issuers of ABCP was directly related to the extent of their holdings of risky\nhousing-related assets. 16 And work by John Taylor and John Williams suggests that the evidence\non the behavior of interest rate spreads around that time is consistent with counterparty risk. 17\nWhile these research results were not available to policymakers in real time, they do support the\nhypothesis that markets were responding in a plausibly efficient manner to a significant revision\nin expectations about the underlying economic fundamentals. If that’s true, then central bank\nlending, by subsidizing borrowers, is likely to have simply undercut the private lending that\nwould have taken place. This increases moral hazard by reducing the perceived cost to financial\ninstitutions of getting into funding difficulty in the future.\nThis trade-off between cushioning the blow of financial market disruptions and distorting banks’\nincentives is typically thought of as a long-run issue. Because financial crises are relatively\ninfrequent, the incentive distortion will only affect outcomes in the relatively distant future, in\nthis view. This may be why policymakers often seem willing to act so aggressively against\ncurrent turmoil and often seem confident that sufficient time remains to contain moral hazard\neffects through tougher regulation. But the crisis we have just been through tells a more\ncomplicated story. It wasn’t just some distant future crisis that was affected by the precedents\nbeing set; it was the next chapter in the current crisis. Each new move to expand institutions’\nreliance on Fed lending also had the effect of increasing expectations of official support in the\nmonths ahead.\nSo it seems quite plausible to me that the signal sent by the Fed’s lending actions in August 2007\ndampened the willingness of troubled institutions, such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, to\nseek safer solutions to the strains they were facing — whether by raising capital, selling assets or\nreducing reliance on short-term funding. In March 2008, Bear and many other large investment\nbanks remained dependent on overnight repo markets to fund holdings of some illiquid\nmortgage-related assets. The perceived likelihood of Fed support in the event that investors\npulled away is bound to have influenced the choice to continue that dependence.\nWhen Bear lost funding in mid-March, the critical fear was that without government support,\ninvestors would pull away from other investment banks as well. Backstop lending was thus\nnecessitated by expectations of backstop lending. The assisted purchase of Bear Stearns seems\nlikely to have influenced in turn the perceptions of government support for other large financial\ninstitutions, which seems likely to have affected how such firms were positioned as the events of\nthe fall unfolded. I believe that a more measured response by the Fed in August 2007 could have\nresulted in significantly less instability in 2008, although I recognize that I say this with the\nbenefit of hindsight.\nFinancial Stability Policy After the Crisis\nAfter the crisis, attention has naturally turned to financial reform. Not surprisingly, alternative\nvisions of financial stability yield different prescriptions for the path forward. The main engine\nof post crisis financial policy is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct, a massive new rule book with enhanced standards for regulation and market practices. Both\nthe inherent fragility view and the induced fragility view find voice in this legislation.\n8\n\n\fAccordingly, the law itself contains some internal contradictions: some good points, some bad\npoints. There’s no doubt that interpretation and implementation of this law, and other policy\nactions to promote financial stability, will continue to be influenced by the alternative theoretical\nperspectives I’ve discussed.\nIt would take a separate lecture to do justice to the Dodd-Frank Act. I will just highlight one\nproject that in my view holds out the promise of improving financial stability no matter which\nview one subscribes to. Title I of Dodd-Frank requires that important financial firms submit\ncredible “living wills” — that is, plans for exactly how they would be wound down in the event\nof bankruptcy. Credible plans for resolving large failing financial institutions without\ngovernment support can bolster policymakers’ commitment to refrain from fragility-inducing\nrescues. And a detailed living will provides a road map for restructuring a firm so that it is not\ninherently fragile.\nMany commentators argue that the crisis discredited modern economic science. I disagree. As I\nhave pointed out along the way, several economists warned long ago about the risks associated\nwith maturity transformation and government backstops. For some commentators, the crisis\ndemonstrated that financial arrangements are inherently more fragile than we had thought. But\none could just as well argue that the crisis showed how much fragility can be induced by\nambiguous rescue policy.\nThere’s no doubt that the crisis will stimulate research for decades to come. Given the magnitude\nof the interventions we’ve seen, research that improves financial policy could yield enormous\nsocial benefits. In this connection I would note that our most recent estimates at the Richmond\nFed are that, as of December 31, 2011, 57 percent of financial sector liabilities benefit from\nperceived government support. This is up from 45 percent over a decade ago and reflects in part\nan expansion of implied commitments based on new precedents set during this crisis. In my\nview, this growth in government support for the financial sector is not sustainable. As economic\npolicy challenges go, I would rate this as second only to the looming federal fiscal imbalance. I\nsincerely hope we can make progress in the years ahead.\n\n1\n\nGraham Allison, “Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis,” 1st edition, New York: Little Brown,\n1971.\n2\nJeffrey Lacker, “Economics After the Crisis: Reflections on a Return to Madison,” Speech at the University of\nWisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wis., October 3, 2011; and “Reflections on Economics, Policy, and the Financial\nCrisis,” Speech to the Kentucky Economic Association, Frankfort, Ky., September 24, 2010.\n3\nThese transcripts are available online at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2007.htm.\n4\nI would like to thank John Weinberg, Kartik Athreya, Ned Prescott and Huberto Ennis for assistance in preparing\nthis lecture.\n5\nDouglas W.

Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nSouth Carolina Business & Industry Political Education Committee’s 27th Annual Meeting\nColumbia, S.C.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to join you at the turn of the year. This\ntraditionally is a time to reflect on the year just past and take a look at what the new year might\nhold in store for us. I think I can guess what many of you are concerned about regarding the year\nahead, so I should warn you that I will have nothing to say about the prospects of the Ravens or\nthe Redskins. Instead, my focus today will be on the economic outlook, and while for some that\nmight be less interesting than pigskin prognostication, it might be a good thing to take our minds\noff sports for a time. Before I begin, however, I should emphasize that the views expressed are\nmy own and should not be attributed to anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nI will begin with the outlook for inflation, since maintaining price stability over time is really the\nFed’s primary mission as the nation’s central bank. Over the last 20 years, the Fed has had a\ncommendable record on inflation, averaging 2 percent inflation per year. There have been yearto-year fluctuations, to be sure. But these temporary swings have evened out over time, and\ninflation has tended to return to around 2 percent. In fact, inflation has averaged quite close to\nthat figure since the end of the Great Recession in June 2009. Overall inflation has subsided of\nlate, led by the recent easing in energy prices; headline inflation was just 1.4 percent, year over\nyear, in November. But the same measure of inflation was 2.6 percent in November 2011, which\nis a good illustration of the short-term swings we’ve been seeing. With futures markets\nforecasting flat or declining energy prices, most economists expect headline inflation to average\na little less than 2 percent this year. I agree with that outlook.\nThe record of low and fairly stable inflation over the last two decades is a substantial\nimprovement over previous decades. 2 The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC (the\ngroup that determines monetary policy), issued an important statement in January 2012 on its\n“Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.” 3 In that document, the Committee stated that inflation\nat the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s\nstatutory mandate. This formally committed the FOMC to what Fed watchers had long believed\nwas the FOMC’s unofficial target of 2 percent inflation.\nA formal commitment to a numerical inflation objective is important for transparency and\naccountability, but it’s also important for keeping expectations regarding future inflation well\nanchored. Because doubts about whether the Fed will keep inflation low and stable can\nthemselves give rise to inflation pressures, history has shown that restoring our credibility can be\n1\n\n\fan arduous and costly process. Fortunately, current measures of inflation expectations suggest\nthat consumers, business firms and investors anticipate continued stability in inflation in coming\nyears. These measures include survey-based indexes and measures of inflation expectations\nderived from the relative yields of indexed and unindexed U.S. Treasury securities. Each of these\nmeasures has its own peculiarities, but they’re all providing readings consistent with the low and\nstable inflation rates of the last two decades.\nIn contrast to inflation, real economic growth and labor market conditions are affected by a wide\nrange of factors outside a central bank’s control. In fact, the effects of monetary stimulus on real\noutput and employment are less than is widely thought; they consist largely of the transitory\nbyproducts of frictions that delay the timely adjustment of prices by businesses. Attempts to\noverstimulate real economic activity via monetary policy can instead run the risk of raising\ninflation. Indeed, for reasons I will discuss later on, I see material upside risks to inflation in\n2014 and beyond, given the current trajectory for monetary policy, though my baseline outlook is\nfor inflation to move toward the Fed’s long-run goal of 2 percent in coming years.\nTurning to the outlook for real economic growth, since the Great Recession officially bottomed\nout at the end of the second quarter of 2009, economic activity has expanded at only a modest\npace. Real gross domestic product, for example, has risen at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent\nsince the end of the recession. This pace is widely viewed as disappointing, since it falls short of\nthe average gross domestic product growth of 3-1/2 percent the U.S economy achieved over the\ncourse of the 20th century. Virtually this entire shortfall represents a difference in the average\ngrowth in employment — that is, the growth in output per worker is not terribly different\nbetween the two periods. Typically, one would expect growth to exceed the long-run average at\nsome point during an expansion to make up for the negative growth recorded during recessions.\nSeveral factors appear to be impeding a more rapid expansion in the U.S. economy. First, the\nhousing boom created a substantial oversupply of new homes, and while significant progress is\nevident, we have not completely worked through that oversupply. Thus home construction and\nhome prices were essentially flat for the first two years of the recovery. Last year, however,\nhousing activity picked up and was a source of modest strength for the economy. Prices in many\nmarkets bottomed out and began to rise, and new construction activity has been steadily\nimproving. Having said that, my sense is that there is a substantial overhang of homes that are a\npoor match for what consumers want and can afford right now. Thus, we should not expect, nor\nshould we desire, a return to the booming housing market conditions that we saw prior to the last\nrecession.\nA second, and related, factor behind the slow recovery was the significant shift in economic\nactivity away from industries related to residential construction. The rapid loss of jobs in these\nindustries, layered on top of ongoing longer-run sectoral shifts, resulted in large inflows into the\nranks of the unemployed and an adverse shift in the composition of the pool of unemployed. This\noften occurs in recessions, when the need for capital investment and retraining to facilitate the\nshift of workers to new sectors slows down the decline in unemployment. The magnitude of the\nresidential construction job loss in this recession was unprecedented, however, so this effect is\nlikely to be significantly larger now.\n\n2\n\n\fThird, the recession appears to have made many consumers more cautious and less willing to\nspend, relative to their income and wealth. The magnitude of the decline in jobs and aggregate\nincome in this recession was far larger than anything American households have seen in the prior\n25 years. And it was accompanied by an unusually large decline in home equity and household\nnet worth. Moreover, given lenders’ loss experience following the last recession, terms and\nqualification standards for secured and unsecured consumer credit have become more stringent.\nThus households understandably have become more apprehensive about their future income\nprospects and more interested in paying down financial obligations and building up savings. So\nwhile consumer spending has grown during this recovery, the tempered pace of that growth has\nlimited the overall pace of the expansion, relative to historical experience.\nFinally, our Fifth District business contacts have long been emphasizing that uncertainty has\ncaused them to delay hiring and investment commitments. These reports became more frequent\nthis past spring and more focused on the uncertainties related to the year-end “fiscal cliff.” The\narray of conceivable fiscal policy remedies would affect a wide range of economic decisions, and\nin response, many businesses have expressed a preference for sitting on the sidelines. But apart\nfrom ambiguity about how Congress and the administration will navigate past the fiscal cliff and\nthe debt ceiling, significant uncertainty remains about the longer-run tax and spending paths, the\nbroad regulatory realignments that are currently in train, and the uncertain prospects for\nEuropean economies.\nIn short, a range of factors appear to be restraining our current pace of economic expansion.\nWhile that pace is below the long-run average for the U.S. over the last century, it’s not hard to\nidentify potential explanations for that shortfall. In fact, if you look back at how other advanced\neconomies have typically behaved following recessions associated with significant housing\nslumps, you will find that the current U.S. expansion is actually not out of the ordinary. 4 This\neconomic expansion, while disappointing, may be the best we should expect given the large\ndecline in the housing market.\nThe data we’ve seen over the course of 2012 have been consistent with this picture of an\neconomy expanding at a moderate pace. Last year this time, growth appeared to be\nstrengthening, and measures of output and employment were picking up pace. In the late spring\nand early summer, however, growth appeared to slow as business investment and exports\nflattened. The reluctance of businesses to invest persisted into the fourth quarter, but some of the\nslowdown in job growth at midyear was later revised away. Early readings on consumer\nspending for the fourth quarter have been encouraging, though survey measures of consumer\nsentiment have fallen sharply, perhaps in response to the post-election media focus on the fiscal\ncliff negotiations. And the modest strengthening in residential construction has continued into\nthe last half of 2012.\nAs for the outlook for the U.S. economy, my best guess is that growth will continue into next\nyear at an annual rate of around 2 percent, as many of the recent impediments to faster growth\ncontinue to restrain activity. Beyond 2013, the rate of growth could rise if the effects of these\nrestraining factors ease, which seems plausible. Meaningful progress on federal budget issues,\nparticularly the long-run imbalance that must be addressed, would alleviate some of the policy\nuncertainty that appears to have dampened growth in 2012. The risks emanating from Europe\n3\n\n\fcould diminish this year as it emerges from a recession and makes progress toward new\ninstitutional arrangements. Improved European growth prospects for 2014, which most\neconomists are forecasting, would be a positive for U.S. exports.\nAnd I think U.S. households could well be more confident and better disposed to spending a year\nfrom now. Improvements in the effectiveness of labor markets at matching workers and job\nopenings would lead to gains in household income. Modest additional growth in home prices,\nalong the lines of what we saw in 2012, would add to net household wealth and aid the\ndeleveraging process. All of these developments would tend to reduce consumer apprehension\nabout downside risks and thereby bolster spending.\nThis outlook is not without risks, of course. Significant energy price increases or an unexpected\ndownturn in some major trading partners could temporarily reduce overall U.S. growth. Failure\nto resolve a significant measure of the uncertainty hanging over federal tax and spending policy\nthis year would indefinitely prolong the reluctance of businesses to commit to investment and\nhiring in the U.S. Moreover, even with a resolution of fiscal uncertainty, significant uncertainty\nregarding regulatory policies could continue to dampen growth. On the other hand, a strongerthan-expected resurgence in confidence is not inconceivable; rapid and convincing progress\ntoward fiscal sustainability, for example, might release a rush of pent-up spending, perhaps\nleading to the above-trend growth that has so far eluded us.\nEven though growth has been below our long-run trend rate since the recession, and may remain\nbelow trend for some time, I believe that the fundamental prospects for longer-term U.S. growth\nremain quite strong. The flexibility and resilience of our markets, along with a relatively welleducated population, make this an advantageous place to implement innovations. One sector\nwhere this longer-term strength of our economy is evident is manufacturing, where growth\nduring the current expansion has actually been fairly strong compared to the decade leading up to\nthe recession. The backstory in manufacturing, of course, is the global outsourcing of low-skilled\noperations that has occurred over the last several decades. But we’ve seen countervailing growth\nin cases where locating domestically has significant advantages. For some suppliers, for\nexample, proximity to downstream operations is critical, as in the automobile industry. For\nothers, proximity to key research and design personnel is important, as with advanced\nmanufacturing that uses more sophisticated capital equipment. In addition, the emergence of\ninexpensive new energy resources in the U.S. — in the shale bed regions — could support costeffective domestic production in industries that are relatively energy-intensive or reliant on\npetrochemical feedstocks.\nOur major challenge over the longer haul is finding effective ways to deepen the knowledge and\nskills of our people. Expanding our human capital is fundamental to improving our standards of\nliving because implementing new technologies has generally required a more skilled workforce.\nIn this arena, an array of strategies could yield beneficial returns over the long run, from ensuring\nthe continued vitality of institutions of higher education and research to investing in high-quality\nearly childhood education. Particular attention is warranted, I believe, to career and technical\ntraining, which can provide flexible, market-responsive skill development for both new entrants\nto the labor force and those workers transiting from declining to expanding sectors. 5\n\n4\n\n\fWhat role does monetary policy play in this outlook? Our primary responsibility at the Federal\nReserve is to keep inflation low and stable; this allows businesses and consumers to make\neconomic decisions without needing to worry about the purchasing power of money. My\neconomic outlook presumes that the FOMC will not allow monetary instability to disrupt\neconomic growth, as arguably took place in the 1970s. But beyond avoiding the economic\ndamage associated with high and variable inflation, I believe it is unlikely that the Federal\nReserve can push real growth rates materially higher than they otherwise would be, on a\nsustained basis.\nNonetheless, at its December meeting, the FOMC adopted measures to attempt to bolster\neconomic growth. Notably, the Committee decided to continue the monthly purchases of $40\nbillion in agency mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion in long-term U.S. Treasury\nsecurities. It also underscored its attention to real economic activity and employment by stating\nits forward guidance for interest rate policy in terms of a 6.5 percent threshold for the\nunemployment rate.\nI dissented from these Committee actions and have expressed my concerns at length elsewhere. 6\nBriefly, as I’ve touched on today, I think that further monetary stimulus is unlikely to materially\nincrease the pace of economic expansion, and that these actions will test the limits of our\ncredibility. At some point, we will need to withdraw stimulus by raising interest rates and\nreducing the size of our balance sheet, and the larger our balance sheet, the more vulnerable we\nwill be to seemingly minor miscalibrations in policy. Accordingly, I see an increased risk, given\nthe course the Committee has set, that inflation pressures emerge and are not thwarted in a timely\nway. I intend to remain alert for signs that our monetary policy stance needs adjustment.\nIn closing, I should reiterate that despite the unique nature of the monetary and fiscal policy\nchallenges facing us, U.S. economic fundamentals are strong and auger well for growth\npossibilities in the years just ahead. To me, this suggests that the rewards are high for getting\neconomic policy right. And as an economist, I have to believe that people, including policy\nofficials, respond to incentives.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb, John Weinberg and Andy Bauer for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nFor an account, see Marvin Goodfriend, “Monetary Policy Comes of Age: A Twentieth Century Odyssey.” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, Winter 1997, vol. 83, no. 1, pp. 1-22.\n3\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.” News and Events,\nMonetary Policy Press Release, January 25, 2012.\n4\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Are Recoveries from Banking and Financial Crises Really So\nDifferent?” International Finance Discussion Papers, no. 1037, November 2011.\n5\nJeffrey M.

But apart\nfrom ambiguity about how Congress and the administration will navigate past the fiscal cliff and\nthe debt ceiling, significant uncertainty remains about the longer-run tax and spending paths, the\nbroad regulatory realignments that are currently in train, and the uncertain prospects for\nEuropean economies.\nIn short, a range of factors appear to be restraining our current pace of economic expansion.\nWhile that pace is below the long-run average for the U.S. over the last century, it’s not hard to\nidentify potential explanations for that shortfall. In fact, if you look back at how other advanced\neconomies have typically behaved following recessions associated with significant housing\nslumps, you will find that the current U.S. expansion is actually not out of the ordinary. 4 This\neconomic expansion, while disappointing, may be the best we should expect given the large\ndecline in the housing market.\nThe data we’ve seen over the course of 2012 have been consistent with this picture of an\neconomy expanding at a moderate pace. Last year this time, growth appeared to be\nstrengthening, and measures of output and employment were picking up pace. In the late spring\nand early summer, however, growth appeared to slow as business investment and exports\nflattened. The reluctance of businesses to invest persisted into the fourth quarter, but some of the\nslowdown in job growth at midyear was later revised away. Early readings on consumer\nspending for the fourth quarter have been encouraging, though survey measures of consumer\nsentiment have fallen sharply, perhaps in response to the post-election media focus on the fiscal\ncliff negotiations. And the modest strengthening in residential construction has continued into\nthe last half of 2012.\nAs for the outlook for the U.S. economy, my best guess is that growth will continue into next\nyear at an annual rate of around 2 percent, as many of the recent impediments to faster growth\ncontinue to restrain activity. Beyond 2013, the rate of growth could rise if the effects of these\nrestraining factors ease, which seems plausible. Meaningful progress on federal budget issues,\nparticularly the long-run imbalance that must be addressed, would alleviate some of the policy\n3\n\n\funcertainty that appears to have dampened growth in 2012. The risks emanating from Europe\ncould diminish this year as it emerges from a recession and makes progress toward new\ninstitutional arrangements. Improved European growth prospects for 2014, which most\neconomists are forecasting, would be a positive for U.S. exports.\nAnd I think U.S. households could well be more confident and better disposed to spending a year\nfrom now. Improvements in the effectiveness of labor markets at matching workers and job\nopenings would lead to gains in household income. Modest additional growth in home prices,\nalong the lines of what we saw in 2012, would add to net household wealth and aid the\ndeleveraging process. All of these developments would tend to reduce consumer apprehension\nabout downside risks and thereby bolster spending.\nThis outlook is not without risks, of course. Significant energy price increases or an unexpected\ndownturn in some major trading partners could temporarily reduce overall U.S. growth. Failure\nto resolve a significant measure of the uncertainty hanging over federal tax and spending policy\nthis year would indefinitely prolong the reluctance of businesses to commit to investment and\nhiring in the U.S. Moreover, even with a resolution of fiscal uncertainty, significant uncertainty\nregarding regulatory policies could continue to dampen growth. On the other hand, a strongerthan-expected resurgence in confidence is not inconceivable; rapid and convincing progress\ntoward fiscal sustainability, for example, might release a rush of pent-up spending, perhaps\nleading to the above-trend growth that has so far eluded us.\nEven though growth has been below our long-run trend rate since the recession, and may remain\nbelow trend for some time, I believe that the fundamental prospects for longer-term U.S. growth\nremain quite strong. The flexibility and resilience of our markets, along with a relatively welleducated population, make this an advantageous place to implement innovations. One sector\nwhere this longer-term strength of our economy is evident is manufacturing, where growth\nduring the current expansion has actually been fairly strong compared to the decade leading up to\nthe recession. The backstory in manufacturing, of course, is the global outsourcing of low-skilled\noperations that has occurred over the last several decades. But we’ve seen countervailing growth\nin cases where locating domestically has significant advantages. For some suppliers, for\nexample, proximity to downstream operations is critical, as in the automobile industry. For\nothers, proximity to key research and design personnel are important, as with advanced\nmanufacturing that uses more sophisticated capital equipment. In addition, the emergence of\ninexpensive new energy resources in the U.S. — in the shale bed regions — could support costeffective domestic production in industries that are relatively energy-intensive or reliant on\npetrochemical feedstocks.\nOur major challenge over the longer haul is finding effective ways to deepen the knowledge and\nskills of our people. Expanding our human capital is fundamental to improving our standards of\nliving because implementing new technologies has generally required a more skilled workforce.\nIn this arena, an array of strategies could yield beneficial returns over the long run, from ensuring\nthe continued vitality of institutions of higher education and research to investing in high-quality\nearly childhood education. Particular attention is warranted, I believe, to career and technical\ntraining, which can provide flexible, market-responsive skill development for both new entrants\nto the labor force and those workers transiting from declining to expanding sectors. 5\n4\n\n\fWhat role does monetary policy play in this outlook? Our primary responsibility at the Federal\nReserve is to keep inflation low and stable; this allows businesses and consumers to make\neconomic decisions without needing to worry about the purchasing power of money. My\neconomic outlook presumes that the FOMC will not allow monetary instability to disrupt\neconomic growth, as arguably took place in the 1970s. But beyond avoiding the economic\ndamage associated with high and variable inflation, I believe it is unlikely that the Federal\nReserve can push real growth rates materially higher than they otherwise would be, on a\nsustained basis.\nNonetheless, at its December meeting, the FOMC adopted measures to attempt to bolster\neconomic growth. Notably, the Committee decided to continue the monthly purchases of $40\nbillion in agency mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion in long-term U.S. Treasury\nsecurities. It also underscored its attention to real economic activity and employment by stating\nits forward guidance for interest rate policy in terms of a 6.5 percent threshold for the\nunemployment rate.\nI dissented from these Committee actions and have expressed my concerns at length elsewhere. 6\nBriefly, as I’ve touched on today, I think that further monetary stimulus is unlikely to materially\nincrease the pace of economic expansion, and that these actions will test the limits of our\ncredibility. At some point, we will need to withdraw stimulus by raising interest rates and\nreducing the size of our balance sheet, and the larger our balance sheet, the more vulnerable we\nwill be to seemingly minor miscalibrations in policy. Accordingly, I see an increased risk, given\nthe course the Committee has set, that inflation pressures emerge and are not thwarted in a timely\nway. I intend to remain alert for signs that our monetary policy stance needs adjustment.\nIn closing, I should reiterate that despite the unique nature of the monetary and fiscal policy\nchallenges facing us, U.S. economic fundamentals are strong and auger well for growth\npossibilities in the years just ahead. To me, this suggests that the rewards are high for getting\neconomic policy right. And as an economist, I have to believe that people, including policy\nofficials, respond to incentives.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb, John Weinberg and Andy Bauer for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nFor an account, see Marvin Goodfriend, “Monetary Policy Comes of Age: A Twentieth Century Odyssey.” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, Winter 1997, vol. 83, no. 1, pp. 1-22.\n3\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.” News and Events,\nMonetary Policy Press Release, January 25, 2012.\n4\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Are Recoveries from Banking and Financial Crises Really So\nDifferent?” International Finance Discussion Papers, no. 1037, November 2011.\n5\nJeffrey M.

Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharlotte Chamber of Commerce Annual Economic Outlook Conference\nCharlotte, N.C.\n\nGood afternoon. I am pleased to be with you again to discuss the economic outlook, although I\nmust say that the recent passing of Henry Faison makes this a bittersweet occasion. Henry served\non the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond from 1990 to 1995, the last\ntwo years of which he served as chairman. We knew Henry as a man of drive and determination,\nbut also principle and generosity. In addition to being an exceptionally successful entrepreneur\nand an outstanding Charlottean, he was also a staunch supporter of the Federal Reserve and our\nquest for price stability. It’s hard to picture this wonderful annual event without Henry’s charm\nand grace and his annual appraisal of the Fed’s inflation performance. I know I will miss him\ngreatly.\nThe economic outlook is the main order of business today, though, and before I begin, I should\nemphasize that the views expressed are my own and should not be attributed to anyone else in\nthe Federal Reserve System. 1 I will begin with the outlook for inflation. Over the last 20 years\ninflation has averaged 2.05 percent per year. There have been year-to-year fluctuations, to be\nsure. But these temporary swings have evened out over time, and inflation has tended to return to\naround 2 percent. In fact, since the Great Recession, inflation has averaged 2.01 percent.\nAlthough inflation was running at elevated rates a few months ago, driven up by a bulge in retail\ngasoline prices, energy prices have subsided of late. With futures markets forecasting flat or\ndeclining energy prices, most economists expect headline inflation to average a little less than 2\npercent next year. I agree with that outlook.\nI began with inflation to emphasize that the behavior of inflation is fundamentally attributable to\nthe actions of the central bank. In contrast to inflation, real economic growth and labor market\nconditions are affected by a wide range of factors outside the central bank’s control. In fact, the\neffects of monetary stimulus on real output and employment, are less than is widely thought;\nthey consist largely of the transitory byproducts of frictions that delay the timely adjustment of\nprices. Attempts to overstimulate real economic activity via monetary policy can instead run the\nrisk of raising inflation. Indeed, for reasons I will discuss later on, I see material upside risks to\ninflation in 2014 and beyond, given the current trajectory for monetary policy, though my\nbaseline outlook is for inflation to move toward the Fed’s long-run goal of 2 percent in coming\nyears.\nTurning to the outlook for growth, the expansion in economic activity since the Great Recession\nofficially bottomed out at the end of the second quarter of 2009 has been disappointing. Real\n1\n\n\fgross domestic product, for example, has risen at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent during\nthis recovery, and job growth has averaged about 140,000 per month.\nSeveral factors appear to be impeding a more rapid recovery in the U.S. economy. First, the\nhousing boom created a substantial oversupply of new homes, and while significant progress is\nevident, we have not completely worked through that oversupply. New construction activity has\nbeen gradually improving, however, and home prices in many markets have bottomed out and\nare on the rise. Still, we should not expect the rapid rebound in housing that we have often seen\nin past recoveries.\nA second, and related, factor behind the slow recovery was the significant shift in economic\nactivity away from industries related to residential construction. The rapid loss of jobs in these\nindustries, layered on top of ongoing longer-run sectoral shifts, resulted in large inflows into the\nranks of the unemployed and an adverse shift in the average skill level of the unemployed. This\neffect is typical in a recession, but is larger now because of the magnitude of this recession. The\nneed for capital investment and retraining as workers shift to new sectors has been slowing down\nrecovery in the labor market.\nThird, the Great Recession appears to have made many consumers more cautious and less\nwilling to spend, relative to their income and wealth. Households have become more\napprehensive about their future income prospects and more interested in paying down financial\nobligations. So while consumer spending has grown during this recovery, the tempered pace of\nthat growth has limited the overall pace of the expansion, relative to previous recoveries.\nFinally, our Fifth District business contacts have long been emphasizing that uncertainty has\ncaused them to delay hiring and investment commitments. The uncertainty that is most on\neveryone’s mind at the moment concerns the looming year-end fiscal cliff. The total size of the\nspending cuts and tax increases slated to take effect is large enough to be at least temporarily\ndisruptive to economic activity. But even if Congress and the administration get us past the fiscal\ncliff and the debt ceiling, significant uncertainty will remain about the longer-run tax and\nspending paths, the broad regulatory realignments that are currently in train and the uncertain\nprospects for European economies.\nIn short, much of the recent sluggishness is understandable. In fact, if you look back at how other\nadvanced economies have typically behaved following recessions associated with housing\nslumps, you will find that the current U.S. recovery is actually not out of the ordinary. 2\nMy best guess is that growth will continue into next year at an annual rate of 2 percent and that\nbeyond 2013 we should see growth begin to firm. Several important suppositions lie behind this\nforecast. First, I expect to see meaningful progress on federal budget issues ― both short-run and\nlong-run ― now that the election is behind us. Second, I expect risks emanating from Europe to\ncontinue to diminish next year as they make progress toward new institutional arrangements and\nemerge from recession. Third, my outlook is predicated on gradual gains in household\nconfidence. Improvements in labor market effectiveness and modest growth in home prices\nshould combine to reduce consumer apprehension about downside risks and thereby bolster\nspending.\n2\n\n\fThis outlook is not without risks. Significant energy price increases or an unexpected downturn\nin some major trading partners could temporarily reduce overall U.S growth. On the other hand,\na stronger-than-expected resurgence in confidence is not inconceivable; rapid and convincing\nprogress toward fiscal sustainability, for example, might release a rush of pent-up spending.\nEven though growth has been below our long-run trend rate since the recession, I believe that the\nfundamental prospects for longer-term U.S. growth remain quite strong. The flexibility and\nresilience of our markets, along with a relatively well-educated population, make this an\nadvantageous place to implement innovations. Our major challenge over the longer haul is to\nfind effective ways to deepen the knowledge and skills of our people because expanding our\nhuman capital is fundamental to improving our standards of living.\nWhat role does monetary policy play in this outlook? Our primary responsibility at the Federal\nReserve is to keep inflation low and stable; this allows businesses and consumers to make\neconomic decisions without needing to worry about inflation. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee, or FOMC (the body that determines monetary policy), took an important step to\nsolidify confidence in its commitment to price stability with its January statement on “LongerRun Goals and Policy Strategy.” 3 That document identified 2 percent inflation, as measured by\nthe annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, as most consistent\nover the longer run with the its statutory mandate.\nBeyond satisfying our inflation mandate, however, it’s not clear that monetary policy, by itself,\ncan bring about any material improvement in economic growth. At its meeting last week, the\nFOMC decided to continue the monthly purchases of $40 billion in agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities and $45 billion in long-term U.S Treasury securities.\nIn my view, the supply of bank reserves is already large enough to support the economic\nrecovery, and the benefits of further asset purchases are unlikely to be sizeable. The effects on\nlonger-term interest rates are uncertain and likely quite small, and the potential to boost job\ncreation seems quite limited, given the fundamental impediments that appear to be restraining\ngrowth now. At the same time, it’s important to recognize the potential costs of additional asset\npurchases. A larger Fed balance sheet will increase the risks associated with the timely and\nappropriate withdrawing of monetary stimulus by raising interest rates and selling assets.\nMy assessment was that the costs associated with additional asset purchases outweighed the\nexpected benefits, and thus, I dissented. In its statement following last week’s meeting, the\nFOMC said that “[i]n determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, [it] will,\nas always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.” At the\npress conference following the meeting Chairman Bernanke noted that “[i]f future evidence\nsuggests that the program’s effectiveness has declined or if potential unintended side effects or\nrisks become apparent as the balance sheet grows, we will modify the program as appropriate.” I\nanticipate that the Committee will regularly reassess the benefits and costs of the asset purchases\nand make adjustments to the program as warranted.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Committee also altered its description of its expectations regarding future interest rate\nchanges, replacing its previous date-based forward guidance with guidance based on numerical\nthresholds. Specifically, the Committee said it anticipates the current “exceptionally low” target\nrange for the federal funds is likely to remain appropriate “at least as long as the unemployment\nrate remains above 6.5 percent, the inflation rate over the next one to two years is projected to be\nno more than half a percentage point above its 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term\ninflation expectations continue to be well anchored.” I had dissented previously against the use\nof a date-based forward guidance, so I supported the decision to drop such language at the\nDecember meeting.\nI agree that it’s useful for the Committee to describe how its future actions are likely to depend\non the evolving state of the economy. However, a single indicator cannot provide a complete\npicture of labor market conditions. More broadly, monetary policy has only a limited ability to\nimprove the path of unemployment, and such effects are transient and generally short-lived.\nFor these reasons I believe that tying the federal funds rate to a specific numerical threshold for\nunemployment is inconsistent with a balanced approach to the FOMC’s price stability and\nmaximum employment mandates. I would have preferred to describe in qualitative terms the\neconomic conditions under which our monetary policy stance is likely to change. 4 It’s true that\nthe Committee’s forward guidance contains a safeguard with respect to inflation, in that keeping\nrates low requires that inflation is projected to remain close to our 2 percent objective and that\ninflation expectations remain well anchored. Nevertheless, this sets up a potentially problematic\ntension between two competing commitments — one to price stability and the other to an\nunemployment rate threshold. These two commitments could well conflict because inflationary\npressures can arise without triggering the inflation safety clause. In the past, we’ve had to act\npre-emptively to head off incipient inflation pressures because re-establishing credibility after it\nhas eroded is costly and economically damaging.\nThe broader issue is that disappointing labor market outcomes have motivated a search for how\nmuch stimulus can be provided ― or promised for the future ― without diminishing the Fed’s\ncredibility for price stability. Inflation has averaged quite close to our 2 percent objective in\nrecent years, but continuation of that record of success should not be taken for granted. We do\nnot really know whether monetary policy can make a sustainable difference in labor market\noutcomes, and we may be attempting to achieve more rapid improvement than is feasible. We\nneed to be careful that in our zeal to promise future stimulus, we do not constrain ourselves in\nways that endanger the price stability on which we’ve come to depend.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Are Recoveries from Banking and Financial Crises Really So\nDifferent?” International Finance Discussion Papers, no. 1037, November 2011.

I disagreed with the Committee’s decision to continue\npurchasing additional assets to stimulate the economy.

            "content": "Perspectives on Monetary and Credit Policy\nNovember 20, 2012\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nShadow Open Market Committee Symposium\nNew York, N.Y.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee in January formally announced a numerical objective for\ninflation, a step which has long been argued to be essential to anchoring longer-term\nexpectations about the conduct of monetary policy. 1 So it might seem a bit surprising, as this\nyear draws to a close, to find a member of the Committee speaking at an event whose title is\n“The Fed’s Monetary Policy Adrift.” But on further reflection, I don’t think it should be\nsurprising at all. Both the FOMC’s articulation of an inflation target and the sense that policy is\nadrift are related, I believe, to the extraordinary circumstances and resulting policy actions of the\nlast few years. In my remarks this morning, I will discuss two dimensions of Federal Reserve\npolicy that came in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession: first, the effort to\nprovide stimulus and policy guidance at the zero bound; and second, the expansion of the scope\nof Fed policy beyond monetary policy to a broader engagement in credit policy. Before I begin,\nhowever, I need to recite a disclaimer that should be quite familiar to members of the Shadow\nOpen Market Committee — my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of any\nother members of the FOMC. 2\nMaintaining Credibility\nLet me begin by noting that when the FOMC announced an explicit numerical objective for\ninflation this year, we had experienced an extended period of relative monetary stability.\nSpecifically, since December of 1993, inflation (as measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures) has averaged very close to 2 percent per year — a very good\nperformance when compared against previous decades. To be sure, that performance has not\nbeen perfect; inflation averaged over 3 percent for the five years from mid-2003 to mid-2008, a\nsubpar outcome for which we at the Fed should accept responsibility. Nevertheless, despite such\nswings, inflation has generally tended to return to around 2 percent, and this appears to have\nenhanced public confidence in the Fed’s willingness and ability to keep inflation low and stable.\nCritical to that process was the Fed’s demonstrated determination to act preemptively against\ninflationary pressures over the last three decades, particularly in 1994, an episode to which I will\nreturn. 3\nThis period of relative success on our implicit inflation objective helped make the announcement\nof an explicit numerical inflation objective in the January statement possible. Actions speak\nlouder than words, after all, and without having seen the Fed take action to preempt inflation,\n1\n\n\fmere words might have done little, by themselves, to bolster credibility. The clear statement of\nthe FOMC’s monetary policy objective was still important, though, to help dispel lingering\ndoubts about the Committee’s intentions and to provide a clear benchmark for accountability.\nImplicit in the Fed’s credibility is some measure of public understanding of how the Fed will\ntypically respond to changes in economic circumstances. That understanding no doubt depends\nheavily on the Fed’s observed responses over the last 20 years or more, but the postwar historical\nrecord does not include any extended periods in which the Fed’s target interest rate was\neffectively at the zero lower bound. As a consequence, uncertainty about future Fed policy\nactions is bound to be greater now than in a more typical interest rate environment. This provides\na compelling reason, in my view, for the FOMC to attempt to provide greater guidance about\nfuture policy conduct. The recent appearance of drift in policy may be attributable to the\nCommittee’s search for more effective ways to communicate about future policy in a relatively\nunique setting.\nCommunicating Policy Actions\nThe most recent innovation in communication has been the use of a calendar date rather than a\nqualitative phrase to characterize the time period over which the Committee anticipates interest\nrates will be exceptionally low. Specifically, the Committee said in August 2011 that it\n“currently anticipates that economic conditions … are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels\nfor the federal funds rate through at least mid-2013.” At subsequent meetings, “mid-2013” was\nchanged to “late 2014,” and then “mid-2015.” The minutes of the August 2011 meeting said that\nthe Committee viewed the change in language as “a shift toward more accommodative policy,”\nimplying a desire to shift the yield curve downward. The language of the statement, however,\nwas phrased as simply a forecast of future Committee behavior.\nThe current formulation of the forward guidance raises the question: How can a change in the\nforecast of future policy settings also be a shift to more accommodative policy? Indeed, market\nparticipants have seemed confused about the extent to which the forward guidance represents a\ncommitment. Committee members have emphasized in public statements that the time frame\nshould be viewed as contingent on incoming data. But describing the forward guidance language\nas “a shift to more accommodative policy” seems to imply that the Committee intends to choose\npolicy settings in the future in a way they would not otherwise see fit at that time. The lack of\nclarity about forward guidance has contributed to a problem highlighted by Michael Woodford\n— namely, that observers may misinterpret a change in the forward guidance date as a\npessimistic shift in the Committee’s assessment of the drivers of economic growth rather than as\na clarification of its reaction function. 4\nExperimentation with more explicit forward guidance has been motivated by suggestions from\nsome economists that the Fed can make current policy more stimulative by assuring the public\nthat it will keep its interest rate target at the zero bound longer than it would if it were following\nits normal pattern of behavior. 5 It’s not clear whether this mechanism can work, however,\nwithout raising expected inflation over some horizon. 6 Adopting such a strategy without\ncompromising longer-term credibility may be feasible in model environments, where absolute\ncredibility can easily be assumed. In practice, however, a central bank’s credibility is often\n2\n\n\fcontingent and incomplete. My reading of recent history is that the Fed’s credibility is not so\nunassailable that inflation expectations can be dialed up for a time and then easily dialed back to\nprice stability. At the very least, the precedent set by an opportunistic attempt to raise inflation\ntemporarily is likely to cloud our credibility for decades to come.\nIt should be unobjectionable, however, to provide forward guidance that reduces unnecessary\nuncertainty about the central bank’s reaction function and thereby helps people make better\npredictions about future monetary policy. For example, the Committee could provide some sense\nof the economic conditions under which it’s likely to begin raising rates and reducing the size of\nits balance sheet. But it’s important to avoid spurious precision. Some of my colleagues have\nsuggested that the Committee provide specific numerical thresholds to help characterize future\npolicy. For example, they suggest that the Committee state that interest rates will be\nexceptionally low at least until the unemployment rate falls below some specific number, as long\nas inflation is projected to be close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and inflation\nexpectations remain stable.\nThis approach would place great weight on a single indicator of labor market conditions, one that\ncan easily lead you astray. This risk seems particularly germane now, given the difficulty of\ndisentangling the trend and cyclical components of labor force participation. The January\nstatement in which the Committee announced its 2 percent inflation objective also explained that\n“[the] Committee considers a wide range of indicators” in assessing labor market conditions.\nCrisp numerical thresholds may work well in the classroom models used to illustrate policy\nprinciples, but one or two economic statistics do not always capture the rich array of policyrelevant information about the state of the economy.\nProponents of numerical thresholds sometimes reply to this criticism by citing the inflation\n“safety valve” clause that says: “as long as inflation is projected to be close to the Committee’s 2\npercent objective and inflation expectations remain stable.” They argue that if a poorly specified\nunemployment threshold caused us to hold interest rates low for too long, inflation expectations\nwould rise and a rate increase would be indicated. This strikes me as an inadequate defense\nbecause it essentially requires that we lose a measure of credibility before it can be invoked. Our\npolicy should strive to maintain the stability of inflation expectations. At times, this requires a\npreemptive tightening of monetary policy, before inflation expectations have deteriorated or\ninflation has surged. In February 1994, for example, the FOMC began tightening monetary\npolicy, despite well-behaved inflation and an unemployment rate over 7 percent. 7\nPurchasing Assets\nIn addition to forward guidance, the FOMC’s other main initiative at the zero bound has been\nasset purchases, with the most recent installment being the purchases of agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities that began after the September meeting. Back in 2009, I fully supported the first wave\nof purchases of U.S. Treasury securities because it was clear that heightened uncertainty had\nincreased the demand for safe liquid assets, such as reserve account balances. Furnishing an\nelastic supply of central bank liabilities in that instance helped prevent deflation.\n\n3\n\n\fSince then, the FOMC’s asset purchase programs have increasingly focused on altering the\ncomposition of the Fed’s asset holdings in order to affect the net public supply of assets with\nparticular characteristics and thereby affect their relative prices. The idea is that some type of\nmarket segmentation breaks the standard arbitrage relationships that would generally keep\nvarious asset prices aligned. Thus, purchases of longer-term Treasury securities are thought to\nreduce the slope of the yield curve, and purchases of mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, are\nthought to reduce their spreads over comparable Treasuries.\nThere is ample room for skepticism about the effect of the Fed’s asset purchases on asset returns.\nA broad array of investors seems to be capable of operating across multiple asset markets, and\nthe markets in which the Fed has been active tend to be relatively broad and deep. Moreover, the\nempirical evidence on the effects of Fed asset purchases, which is based on yield movements\naround the announcements of asset purchases, is ambiguous, given the difficulty of parsing\npolicy signals from pure supply effects.\nWhen the Fed expands reserves by buying private assets, it extends public sector credit to private\nborrowers. To the extent that purchases of private claims have any effect, they do so by\ndistorting the relative cost of credit among different borrowers. Such differential effects are\nunlikely to be beneficial, on net, unless borrowers in the favored sector would otherwise face\nartificially high rates. I think it’s difficult to make this case for agency MBS, a sector that\nhistorically has benefited from heavy subsidies, which arguably contributed to dangerously high\nhomeowner leverage. So I do not see the rationale for reducing the interest rates paid by\nconforming home mortgage borrowers relative to those paid by, say, small-business borrowers.\nMoreover, purchasing agency MBS encourages the continuation of a housing finance model\nbased heavily on government-sponsored enterprises, at a time when the housing sector would be\nbetter served by a new model that relies less on government credit subsidies.\nCredit Market Intervention\nThe pattern of Federal Reserve credit market intervention has evolved over time. The most\nrecent articulation of an explicit credit policy, as such, is the Joint Statement of the Department\nof Treasury and the Federal Reserve of March 23, 2009, which stated that “[government]\ndecisions to influence the allocation of credit are the province of the fiscal authorities.” This\nexpresses well the core idea of a “credit accord” that Professor Marvin Goodfriend first\nadvocated many years ago while at the Richmond Fed, and that I and others have endorsed. 8 The\napparent contradiction between the March 2009 Treasury-Fed statement and the FOMC’s recent\ninterventions to steer credit to the housing market also may be contributing to the perception that\nFederal Reserve credit policy is adrift.\nUncertainty regarding Fed credit policy has precedents, whether it involves direct lending or\npurchases of private sector assets. For several decades prior to the recent crisis, policy regarding\nlending to financially stressed firms was often characterized by “constructive ambiguity.” 9\nFinancial firms and their creditors were encouraged to believe they would not be rescued in the\nevent of distress, while officials preserved their ability to intervene should a crisis actually arise.\nConstructive ambiguity sought to obtain the ex-ante incentive benefits of commitment without\ngiving up the discretion to act freely ex post. But taking their cues from central bank actions\n4\n\n\frather than its words, market participants’ expanded their reliance on implied commitments of\ncentral bank liquidity support. This created excruciating dilemmas in times of stress, as was\nvividly illustrated during 2008: Disappoint short-term creditors and massive investor realignment\ndestabilizes markets; rescue short-term creditors and the additional precedent reinforces\nexpectations of future rescues and further intensifies moral hazard. Constructive ambiguity\nbecame increasingly hopeless in the face of accumulating instances of intervention, and the\ntoxicity of credit policy opacity is now quite clear. Financial stability is likely to remain elusive\nwithout constraints on ad hoc rescues of firms facing financial stress.\nUnconstrained credit policy thus poses a thorny problem for the modern central bank, as\nProfessor Goodfriend has forcefully argued. 10 Independent management of their balance sheet is\nessential to a central bank’s ability to conduct monetary policy in a way that is relatively free of\nthe short-term pressures associated with electoral politics. But an immediate consequence of a\ncentral bank’s independence is the capacity to use its balance sheet to direct the flow of credit\ntoward particular market segments, circumventing the constitutional checks and balances that\nwould otherwise apply to such fiscal initiatives. Marvin Goodfriend and my predecessor, Al\nBroaddus, writing in 1994, warned that central bank forays into fiscal policy would be perceived\nas redistributional and would risk entanglement in partisan politics. The political backlash\nfollowing the Federal Reserve’s 2008 actions, I believe, validates their concerns.\nThe reactive evolution of Fed credit policy over recent decades parallels the way monetary\npolicy drifted into instability during the 1960s and 1970s. 11 The process of solving the inherent\ntime consistency problem and restoring monetary stability was long and costly. Legislative and\nconstitutional solutions were proposed, but success depended on the Fed itself making price\nstability a priority and culminated with the FOMC’s adoption of the self-imposed constraint of a\nnumerical inflation target.\nLimiting Central Bank Lending\nThe process of establishing credible limits on central bank lending could be even more difficult\nthan the pursuit of price stability. Whether self-imposed lending constraints could be effective\nremains to be seen. One approach would be for the Fed to operationalize the principles\narticulated in the March 2009 Joint Statement of the Treasury and the Fed. The alternative to\nself-imposed restraint is legislative action. The Dodd-Frank Act pared back the Fed’s ability to\nlend beyond the banking system by limiting the Fed’s so-called “13(3)” powers to lend to\nnondepository firms in “unusual and exigent circumstances.” These restrictions are modest,\nhowever. One could imagine legislation that limits the Fed to a narrowly defined set of ordinary\nlending activities — very short-term lending to sound, solvent banks, against good collateral, at\nrates above interbank market rates. If the Federal Reserve cannot limit credit policy of its own\naccord, legislation may be the best option. And the restraint of credit policy would not be\ncomplete unless limits on reserve bank lending are complemented by limits on the Fed’s ability\nto buy private sector assets.\nExpansive central bank lending has its supporters, and some are likely to argue that such\nrestraints would inhibit performance of the “lender of last resort function” that is traditionally\nthought to be an essential central bank role. Professor Goodfriend is persuasive, I believe, in\n5\n\n\fdemonstrating that this is a misreading of the historical record. A century ago, central bank\nlending was thought of primarily as a means of rapidly increasing the supply of paper bank notes\nwhen the demand for those notes surged, either in connection with seasonal agricultural cycles or\nin connection with financial panics in which depositors sought to convert their deposits into\ncurrency. This is consistent with the purpose of the Federal Reserve Act, which, according to the\npreamble, is “to furnish an elastic currency.” 12\nI will conclude by noting a theme that runs through both the monetary and credit sections of my\nremarks: humility. Central banks are at times asked to do too much — and at times they ask\nthemselves to do too much. Given their fiscal independence and their historically expansive\nauthority, one can see why people look to central banks as public-sector benefactors. But central\nbank success arguably has been associated more with restraint than ambition. The Fed tamed\ninflation when it backed away from overly ambitious notions of the role monetary policy could\nplay in labor market outcomes. I believe that future financial stability will depend similarly on\ncentral bank modesty about its ability to redirect credit flows constructively. The independence\nand effectiveness of the modern central bank will require limiting aspirations.\n1\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.” News and Events,\nMonetary Policy Press Release, January 25, 2012.\n2\nI am grateful to John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n3\nMarvin Goodfriend, “Monetary Policy Comes of Age: A Twentieth Century Odyssey,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nRichmond Economic Quarterly, Winter 1997, vol. 83, no. 1, pp. 1-22.\n4\nMichael Woodford, “Methods of Policy Accommodation at the Interest Rate Lower Bound.” Delivered at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s 2012 Jackson Hole Symposium, Jackson Hole, WY, August 31, 2012.\n5\nWoodford, 2012.

            "content": "Economic Outlook\nNovember 15, 2012\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nWest Virginia Economic Outlook Conference\nCharleston, W.Va.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you this morning to discuss the economic outlook. I’ll be talking about\nthe prospects for real economic growth for the United States as a whole, but I’ll also share some\nobservations about West Virginia’s economy, which, as you all know, has some very special\nfeatures. One aspect of the economic outlook in which many people have a keen interest is the\nFederal Reserve’s monetary policy. This makes sense, since it plays an important role in\nfostering an environment in which people can work, save and invest to expand prosperity. But\nthe role of monetary policy is often overstated, so in my remarks I will talk about what it can,\nand cannot, accomplish. I should emphasize that the views expressed are my own and should not\nbe attributed to anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nMonetary policy is primarily about inflation, so let me begin with an overview of the inflation\nsituation. Over the last 20 years, inflation has averaged 2.07 percent per year. To be sure,\ninflation has varied from year to year. But these temporary swings have evened out over time,\nand inflation has tended to return to around 2 percent. In fact, over the last three years, inflation\nhas averaged 2.06 percent. Although the inflation rate has been elevated in recent months\nbecause of the recent bulge in retail gasoline prices, most economists are expecting headline\ninflation to average about 2 percent, or a little less, over the next year or two. I agree with that\noutlook.\nThe record of low and fairly stable inflation over the last two decades is a substantial\nimprovement over previous decades, and it should be kept in mind whenever we think about\nmonetary policy in recent years. 2 The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC (the group\nthat determines monetary policy), issued an important statement in January on its “Longer-Run\nGoals and Policy Strategy.” 3 In that document, the Committee stated that inflation at the rate of 2\npercent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory\nmandate. This confirmed a long-held belief among Fed watchers that 2 percent constituted the\nFOMC’s unofficial target for inflation.\nBeginning an economic outlook talk with a discussion of inflation is not the usual approach, even\namong Fed officials. I did so simply to emphasize that the behavior of inflation is fundamentally\nattributable to the actions of the central bank. Over the long haul, monetary policy determines the\npurchasing power of money. Central banks have a monopoly on the supply of certain critically\nimportant monetary assets, namely currency and bank reserves. That supply, together with the\n\n\fdemand for those assets, determines their value. An excessive supply leads to inflation ― that is,\na rise in the overall price level. Similarly, an insufficient supply leads to deflation ― that is, a\nfall in the overall price level. Excessive inflation ― or deflation ― can therefore legitimately be\nblamed on the central bank. Conversely, the central bank should get credit when inflation is low\nand stable.\nWhile U.S. inflation is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, real economic growth and labor\nmarket conditions are affected by a wide range of factors outside the Fed’s control. Even at their\nbest, modern economies take time to adjust to unanticipated shocks, and our economy was hit\nwith a very large shock when residential construction collapsed. The pace of adjustment is, in\nturn, affected by a variety of frictions in the economy ― frictions in the way firms determine the\nright prices of their goods, frictions in the process of searching for the most promising\nopportunities to deploy newly available capital and labor resources, and frictions in the way\nworkers and employers search for each other, among others. Monetary policy is simply unable to\noffset all of the ways in which various frictions impede the economy’s adjustment to various\nshocks. It’s unfortunate, but the effects of monetary stimulus on real output and employment are\nless than is widely thought; they consist largely of the transitory byproducts of frictions that\ndelay the timely adjustment of prices to changes in monetary conditions.\nLet’s turn to the growth outlook now. The Great Recession officially bottomed out at the end of\nthe second quarter of 2009, but the expansion in economic activity since then has been\ndisappointing. Real gross domestic product (GDP), for example, has risen at an average annual\nrate of 2.16 percent during this recovery. Labor market conditions have been especially\ndisheartening. We lost over 8 million jobs in the recession and its immediate aftermath; since\nbottoming out in early 2010, we’ve added 4.5 million new jobs, which leaves us far from a\ncomplete recovery.\nIn West Virginia, labor market conditions followed a similar path during the recession, although\nthe timing of the job loss lagged the national trend by several months. The state lost over 25,000\njobs from the peak of employment to the trough reached in early 2010. Since then, the recovery\nhas seen just one-third of those jobs added back. Labor market conditions have weakened in\nrecent months, and the unemployment rate here has climbed now for five consecutive months,\nbucking the national trend. Recent job losses have been concentrated in the energy sector, no\ndoubt reflecting depressed prices for coal and natural gas, as well as the fallout from shifting\nregulatory regimes.\nSeveral factors appear to have impeded a more rapid recovery in the U.S. economy. First, by the\nend of the housing boom, we had built many more new homes than we truly needed. The\nresulting inventory overhang has led to a large and persistent decline in new residential\ninvestment. It now looks as if the worst is behind us and new construction activity is gradually\nimproving. Moreover, home prices in many markets have bottomed out and begun to increase.\nThat said, residential investment is still less than 2.8 percent of GDP, versus 6.2 percent back in\n2005. We still have not seen the rapid rebound in housing that has often contributed to swift\nrecoveries in overall economic activity in the past. Given the extent of housing oversupply that\ndeveloped just before the recession, we probably should not expect housing markets to boom the\nway they did in many places in the past.\n2\n\n\fA second, and related, factor behind the slow recovery was the significant shift in economic\nactivity away from residential construction, housing finance and related supply industries. The\nrapid loss of jobs in these industries, layered on top of ongoing longer-run sectoral shifts,\nresulted in large inflows into the ranks of the unemployed, and it has taken considerable time to\nwhittle down the unemployment rate. In part, this was predictable; it often requires significant\nretraining for laid-off workers to find new employment in other sectors of the economy. In\naddition, capital investment is often required when workers move to new sectors. Thus\nunemployment can remain elevated for a long and frustrating interval following a severe shock.\nThird, the Great Recession appears to have made many consumers more cautious and less\nwilling to spend, relative to their income and wealth. Prior to the recent recession, American\nhouseholds experienced a two-and-a-half-decade run with just two mild recessions in which job\nlosses were relatively limited. In contrast, the declines in income and wealth during the recent\nrecession were far more severe. As a result, consumers have become more apprehensive about\ntheir future income prospects. So while consumer spending has grown during this recovery, the\ntempered pace of that growth has limited the overall pace of the expansion, relative to previous\nrecoveries.\nFinally, for most of this year, our business contacts have been emphasizing that uncertainty has\ncaused them to delay hiring and investment commitments. While their uncertainty may have\nmultiple sources, including the situation in Europe, the most widely mentioned source is the\nnation’s fiscal policy. Here I’ll mention two aspects of the federal fiscal situation. One is the\nfiscal cliff, the combination of spending cuts and tax increases that will automatically occur next\nyear if Congress fails to act. The total size of these changes is such that, should they all take\neffect and remain in effect for a considerable period, the economy is likely to contract and move\nback into recession. The second relevant aspect of the federal fiscal outlook is the long-run\nimbalance between taxes and spending. According to projections by the nonpartisan\nCongressional Budget Office, the deficit is likely to decline somewhat for a few years, but then\nmove higher, both in dollar terms and as a fraction of GDP. This implies that the outstanding\nstock of federal debt will increase without bound as a ratio to GDP. This is not a feasible\nscenario and it cannot persist indefinitely. At some point Congress will have to bring taxes and\nspending into closer alignment. The set of policy choices that are likely to be considered would\naffect almost every household or business in a meaningful way. Until a fiscal plan is adopted that\nis sustainable over the longer run, consumers and businesses will make decisions under a cloud\nof uncertainty.\nIn short, much of the recent sluggishness is understandable. Economies take time to recover from\nsevere shocks. In fact, if you look back at how advanced economies have typically behaved\nfollowing recessions associated with housing slumps, you will find that our current recovery is\nactually not out of the ordinary. 4 What is exceptional about the current recovery is the depth of\nthe contraction that preceded it.\nBut what does the future hold for our economy? My best guess is that growth will continue into\nnext year at an annual rate of 2 percent or above. Toward the end of 2013, we should see growth\nbegin to firm with further improvement beyond that. Several important suppositions lie behind\n3\n\n\fthat forecast, however. First, I expect to see meaningful progress on federal budget issues now\nthat the election is behind us. As I mentioned a moment ago, it will not be enough to simply\nsidestep the fiscal cliff. To meaningfully reduce the uncertainty about tax and spending policy\nthat is discouraging private sector commitments, we will have to see convincing progress toward\na sustainable long-run trajectory for federal policy. Giving the proverbial can a few more kicks\ndown the road is likely to mean continued uncertainty and further disappointment with labor\nmarkets.\nSecond, while the European recession and fiscal challenges pose risks to the U.S. outlook, I\nexpect those risks to diminish next year. European growth has been dampened by the strains of\nconstructing a new collective fiscal regime while coping with the aftermath of the previous\nregime. But despite repeated visits to the brink of financial disorder, eurozone policymakers have\nmade notable progress toward new institutional arrangements. To date, the impact on U.S.\nexports has been manageable and the spillover to U.S financial institutions and markets has been\nlimited.\nThird, my outlook is predicated on a continuation of the gradual improvement we’ve seen in\nhousehold confidence about future income prospects. Improvements in labor market\neffectiveness and modest growth in home prices should combine to reduce consumer\napprehension about downside risks and thereby bolster spending.\nFinally, this outlook is built on the usual assumption of no unanticipated shocks. Indeed, by\ndefinition, it would be hard to forecast any other way. Significant energy price increases would\ntend to temporarily reduce overall growth, although they ultimately would be likely to stimulate\nexploration and new production. An unexpected downturn in growth among our major trading\npartners also has the potential to impede U.S. growth. On the other hand, a stronger-thanexpected resurgence in confidence is not inconceivable; rapid and convincing progress toward\nfiscal sustainability, for example, might release a rush of pent-up spending.\nEven though growth has been below our long-run trend rate since the recession, I believe that the\nfundamental prospects for longer-term U.S. growth remain quite strong. Increases in real income\nultimately depend on the implementation of new products and services and new ways of\nproviding existing products and services. We have a proven ability to generate advances in\nscientific knowledge and new commercial applications. The flexibility and resilience of our\nmarkets, along with a relatively well-educated population, make this an exceptional place to\nimplement innovations. Our major challenge over the longer haul is to find effective ways to\ndeepen the knowledge and skills of our people, because expanding our human capital is\nfundamental to improving our standards of living.\nIn short, I am cautiously optimistic about the near-term outlook and see grounds for more\noptimism about longer-run growth prospects.\nWhat role does monetary policy play in this outlook? Our primary responsibility at the Federal\nReserve is to keep inflation low and stable; this allows businesses and consumers to make\neconomic decisions without needing to worry about inflation. The FOMC took an important step\nto solidify confidence in our commitment to price stability with its January statement on\n4\n\n\f“Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” which formalized a long-run goal for inflation of 2\npercent. Having stated that goal, it’s incumbent upon us to follow through with policy actions\nthat are consistent with maintaining 2 percent inflation.\nBeyond hitting our inflation target, though, it’s not clear whether monetary policy, by itself, can\nbring about any material improvement in economic growth right now. The Fed is currently\nincreasing the quantity of reserves held by the banking system by buying securities ― both longterm U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. In my view, the supply of bank\nreserves is already quite ample and is certainly large enough to support a strengthening recovery.\nAt the same time, it’s important for us to remember that we cannot continually buy more\nsecurities and create more bank reserves without jeopardizing our inflation goal. Accordingly, I\nhave opposed additional easing steps at FOMC meetings this year. My main concern is that we\nhave eased policy aggressively for over four years; at some point, the growth outlook will\nimprove enough that the FOMC will need to begin raising interest rates and reducing the supply\nof bank reserves in order to preserve the price stability that we have enjoyed over the last 20\nyears. As a technical matter, I do believe that we have the tools we need to withdraw\naccommodation soon enough and rapidly enough to keep inflation on target. But as a practical\nmatter, we are in uncharted territory, and that will make it difficult to get the timing just right. In\nthe Fed’s 99-year history, we have never eased monetary policy as aggressively as we have over\nthe last few years. The larger our balance sheet when the time comes to withdraw monetary\nstimulus, the more difficult and risky that process will be. In my view, the balance of\nconsiderations suggests that we should be standing pat now rather than easing policy further.\nOne other aspect of Fed policy is unprecedented right now, besides the sheer size of our balance\nsheet. Until this recession, we have generally restricted ourselves to purchasing U.S. Treasury\nsecurities. But as I noted, we also have been buying mortgage-backed securities, most recently at\na pace of about $40 billion per month. This raises broad concerns that ought to worry us. Buying\nmortgage-backed securities rather than U.S. Treasuries may reduce borrowing rates for\nconforming home mortgages, but if so, it will raise interest rates for other borrowers ― such as\nsmall businesses. I have yet to see a convincing case for distorting markets by channeling credit\ntoward housing debt and away from other sectors.

The\nCommittee released a statement after the meeting saying that it\nexpects a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain\nappropriate for a considerable period after the economic recovery\nstrengthens, and that it currently anticipates that exceptionally low\nlevels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least\nthrough mid-2015.\n\"I dissented for the same reasons that I did at the September meeting\n. I opposed continuing additional asset purchases. Further\nmonetary stimulus now is unlikely to result in a discernible\nimprovement in growth, but if it does, it’s also likely to cause an\nunwanted increase in inflation. Economic activity has been growing at\na modest pace, on average, and inflation has been fluctuating around\n2 percent, which the Committee has identified as its inflation goal .\nUnemployment does remain high by historical standards, but\nimprovement in labor market conditions appears to have been held\nback by real impediments that are beyond the capacity of monetary\npolicy to offset. In such circumstances, further monetary stimulus\nruns the risk of raising inflation in a way that threatens the stability of\ninflation expectations.\n\"I also dissented because I disagreed with the characterization of the\ntime period over which the stance of monetary policy would be highly\naccommodative and the federal funds rate would be exceptionally\nlow. I read the Committee statement as saying that the federal funds\nrate will be exceptionally low for a considerable time after we observe\na marked increase in the growth of employment and output. I do not\nbelieve that a policy conforming to this characterization would be\nappropriate, because it implies providing too much stimulus beyond\nthe point at which rate increases will be required to keep inflation in\ncheck. Such an implied commitment would be inconsistent with a\nbalanced approach to the FOMC’s price stability and maximum\nemployment mandates. I do believe that it is useful for the Committee\n\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\nLaura Fortunato\n(804) 697-8196\n(804) 698-0927 (mobile)\n\n\fto characterize economic conditions under which policy would be\nlikely to change in the future, but specific calendar dates are a highly\nimperfect way of doing so.\n\"Finally, I strongly opposed purchasing additional agency mortgagebacked securities, or MBS. Purchasing MBS can be expected to\nreduce borrowing rates for conforming home mortgages by more than\nit reduces borrowing rates for nonconforming mortgages or for other\nborrowing sectors, such as small business, autos or unsecured\nconsumer loans. Deliberately tilting the flow of credit to one particular\neconomic sector is an inappropriate role for the Federal Reserve. As\nstated in the Joint Statement of the Department of Treasury and the\nFederal Reserve on March 23, 2009, 'Government decisions to\ninfluence the allocation of credit are the province of the fiscal\nauthorities.'\n“My views on the economy and monetary policy are also available on\nrichmondfed.org.”\nThe Richmond Fed serves the Fifth Federal Reserve District, which\nincludes the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, South\nCarolina, Virginia and most of West Virginia.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, October 2012\nOctober 15, 2012\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nRoanoke Regional Chamber of Commerce Policymakers Luncheon\nRoanoke, Va.\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy. The\nFederal Reserve’s monetary policy received a great deal of media attention last month ― though\nperhaps not as much as the presidential election campaign or the performance of NFL referees.\nI’m OK with all of this attention because monetary policy plays an important role in fostering an\nenvironment in which people can work, save and invest to expand prosperity. But the role of\nmonetary policy is often misunderstood, so in my remarks I will talk about what it can, and\ncannot, accomplish. I should emphasize that the views expressed in this talk are my own and\nshould not be attributed to anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.1\nWhat does monetary policy do? First things first: Over the long haul, monetary policy\ndetermines the purchasing power of money. The Fed has an effective monopoly on the supply of\ncertain critically important monetary assets ― namely, currency and bank reserves. That supply,\ntogether with the demand for such assets, determines their value. Excessive supply leads to\nexcessive inflation ― that is, a rise in the overall price level. Insufficient supply leads to\ndeflation ― that is, a fall in the overall price level. Excessive inflation — or deflation —\ntherefore can legitimately be blamed on the central bank. Conversely, we deserve credit when\ninflation is low and stable.\nSo how have we been doing? Some of you in this room probably remember the 1970s, when\ninflation was fairly high on average and at times reached double-digit rates. We fought hard to\nbring inflation under control in the 1980s and 1990s, and over the last 20 years, inflation has\naveraged 2.05 percent per year.2 To be sure, inflation has varied from year to year. But these\ntemporary swings have evened out over time, and inflation has generally run around 2 percent. In\nfact, over the last three years, inflation has averaged precisely 2 percent.\nThe record of low and fairly stable inflation over the last two decades is a substantial\nimprovement over previous decades, and it should be kept in mind whenever we think about\nmonetary policy in recent years. The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, which is\nresponsible for monetary policy, issued an important statement in January of this year on its\n“Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.”3 In that document, the Committee stated that inflation\n1\n\n\fat the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Fed’s statutory\nmandate. This confirmed a long-held belief among Fed watchers that 2 percent constituted the\nFOMC’s unofficial target for inflation.\nBeginning an economic outlook talk with a discussion of inflation is not the usual approach, even\namong Fed officials, perhaps due to the stability of inflation over the last 20 years. I did so\nsimply to emphasize that the behavior of inflation is fundamentally attributable to the actions of\nthe central bank, while growth and labor market conditions are affected by a wide variety of\nfactors outside the Fed’s control. So let’s talk about growth now.\nThe Great Recession officially bottomed out at the end of the second quarter of 2009, but the\nexpansion in economic activity since then has been disappointing. Real gross domestic product\n(GDP), for example, has grown at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent during this recovery.\nLabor market conditions have been particularly disheartening. We lost over 8 million jobs in the\nrecession and its immediate aftermath. Since bottoming out in early 2010, we’ve added 4 ¼\nmillion new jobs, which leaves us far from a complete recovery. The rate of job growth has been\nquite uneven over time. Thus job growth averaged 226,000 jobs per month in the first quarter,\nfell to 67,000 jobs per month in the second quarter and rebounded to 146,000 jobs per month in\nthe third quarter. The most recent rate of job growth is fairly close to the average for this\nrecovery, suggesting that the slowdown in the second quarter was a transitory swing.\nThese labor markets indicators are especially noteworthy because Congress requires that\nmonetary policy should “promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices\nand moderate long-term interest rates.”4 Some observers see these labor market conditions as\nprima facie evidence that the Fed is failing to promote effectively the goal of maximum\nemployment. In particular, many people point to how high the unemployment rate is now by\nhistorical standards.\nBut assessing monetary policy is much more complicated than simply noting that certain\nindicators are far from historical averages. Modern economies are buffeted by unanticipated\ndisturbances. Even at their best, economies take time to adjust to those shocks. The pace of that\nadjustment is, in turn, affected by a variety of frictions in an economy ― frictions in the way\nfirms determine the prices of their goods, frictions in the process of searching for the most\npromising opportunities to deploy available capital and labor resources, and frictions in the way\nworkers and employers search for each other, among others. Monetary policy is simply unable to\noffset all of the ways in which various frictions impede the economy’s adjustment to various\nshocks. The term “maximum employment” in our congressional mandate should therefore be\nthought of as the level of employment that currently can be achieved by a central bank, taking\ninto account its long-run objectives and the very real impediments to a more rapid adjustment to\nrecent economic shocks.\nConsider the severe recession we just experienced. An unanticipated decline in residential\nconstruction resulted in an oversupply of labor and capital. Redeploying those resources\nproductively has been difficult and time-consuming: Retraining is often required for workers to\nfind employment in other sectors, and capital investments are required to absorb the newly\n2\n\n\favailable pool of labor in other sectors. In the absence of further shocks, the economy’s best\nresponse is likely to have the unemployment rate decline gradually over time. How gradually is\nthe critical question. It’s unlikely that we would be able to restore the unemployment rate to its\nlong-run level immediately ― within a quarter or two, for example. At the same time, there are\nsignificant social costs associated with delaying the recovery in labor market conditions too long.\nThe key point here is that simply observing a high unemployment rate does not imply that the\nFed’s monetary policy is failing to comply with its congressional mandate, nor does it\nnecessarily mean that monetary policy needs to do more to achieve its goals.\nThe FOMC was clear about this point in its January statement that I mentioned earlier, and I’d\nlike to quote from that statement:\n“The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that\naffect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over\ntime and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to\nspecify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be\ninformed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such\nassessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a\nwide range of indicators in making these assessments.”\nI believe there are several factors impeding a more rapid recovery in labor market conditions\nright now. First, the housing market is still coping with the large inventory overhang that remains\nfrom the prerecession boom. This sector has begun to show some encouraging signs, with home\nprices and construction improving this year. But housing investment has shrunk to a much\nsmaller part of the overall economy than had typically been the case, and given the inventory\noverhang, residential investment is likely to remain below prerecession levels for a considerable\nperiod.\nSecond, and related, was the significant shift in economic activity away from residential\nconstruction and related supply industries. The rapid loss of jobs in these industries, layered on\ntop of ongoing longer-run sectoral shifts, resulted in large inflows into the ranks of the\nunemployed. The result has been an adverse shift in the skill profile of available workers, which\nhas intensified the reallocation and skill mismatch frictions that hinder labor market clearing.\nThird, the Great Recession appears to have made many consumers more cautious and less\nwilling to spend, relative to their income and wealth. Prior to the recent recession, American\nhouseholds experienced a two-decade run with just two mild recessions in which job losses were\nrelatively limited. In contrast, the declines in income and wealth during the recent recession were\nfar greater. As a result, consumers have become more apprehensive about their future income\nprospects. So while consumer spending has grown during this recovery, the tempered pace of\nthat growth has limited the overall pace of the expansion, relative to previous recoveries.\nFinally, our business contacts frequently emphasize that uncertainty is at a crippling level and\nhas caused them to delay hiring and investment commitments. While there may be multiple\nsources of uncertainty, including the situation in Europe, the most widely mentioned is the\nnation’s fiscal policy. Here I’ll mention two aspects of the federal fiscal situation. One is the\n3\n\n\ffiscal cliff, the combination of spending cuts and tax increases that will automatically occur next\nyear if Congress fails to act. The total size of these changes is such that, should they all take\neffect, the economy is likely to contract and move back into a recession. The second relevant\naspect of the federal fiscal outlook is the long-run imbalance between taxes and spending.\nAccording to projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the deficit is likely to\ndecline somewhat for a few years, but then move higher, both in dollar terms and as a fraction of\nGDP. This implies that the outstanding stock of federal debt will increase without bound as a\nratio to GDP. This is not a feasible scenario and cannot persist indefinitely. At some point,\nCongress will have to align taxes and spending. The set of policy changes that are likely to be\nconsidered affect almost every American consumer or business in a meaningful way. Not\nknowing which of these policies will be adopted, a wide array of economic decision-makers is\nlikely to be affected.\nUncertainty is likely to continue to dampen U.S. growth until there is greater clarity about\nlegislation that Congress and the president are likely to adopt. But merely avoiding the fiscal cliff\nis not likely to be enough. Fiscal uncertainty will continue to restrain growth, I believe, until\nWashington adopts a long-run plan that restores fiscal balance.\nIn short, much of the recent sluggishness is understandable. Economies take time to recover from\nsevere shocks. In fact, if you look back at how advanced economies typically behave after\nrecessions associated with housing slumps, you will find that the current U.S. recovery is\nactually not out of the ordinary.5 What is exceptional is the depth of the contraction phase of this\nrecession.\nSo where do we go from here? My best guess is that growth will begin to firm later next year and\ncontinue to improve beyond that. While the recession in Europe poses risks for this outlook, I\nthink those risks will likely dissipate next year as leaders work through the adjustments\nnecessary for creating a new fiscal regime. As U.S. labor markets continue to heal, I expect\nhousehold confidence to slowly firm and bolster consumer spending.\nThe fundamental prospects for longer-term U.S. growth remain quite promising, in my view, and\nare likely to reassert themselves in the years ahead. We have a proven ability to generate\nadvances in scientific knowledge and commercial innovation. The flexibility and resilience of\nour markets, along with a relatively well-educated populace, make this an excellent market in\nwhich to implement innovations. Our major challenge over the long haul is to deepen the\nknowledge and skills of our people, because growing our human capital is fundamental to\nimproving our standards of living.\nWhat is the role of the Fed’s monetary policy in this outlook? Our first responsibility is to keep\ninflation low and stable; this allows businesses and consumers to make economic decisions\nwithout worrying about inflation. The FOMC took an important step to solidify confidence in\nour commitment to price stability with its January statement on “Longer-Run Goals and Policy\nStrategy” formalizing a long-run goal for inflation of 2 percent.\nI strongly supported my colleagues’ decision to issue that statement, but I have dissented at all\nsix FOMC meetings this year. Let me explain some of my reasoning. At each meeting this year,\n4\n\n\fthe FOMC has voted to leave the federal funds rate near zero, and in each case, I supported that\ndecision. But the Committee also issued “forward guidance,” that is, language stating that\neconomic conditions are likely to warrant a federal funds rate near zero for at least several years.\nI have objected to that language because it’s a highly imperfect way to communicate about future\npolicy. It could be misinterpreted as meaning that the Committee believes the economy will be\nweaker than people had thought. By itself, that could have a dampening effect on current\nactivity, which is not what was intended. On the other hand, it also could be misinterpreted as\nsuggesting a diminished commitment to keeping inflation at 2 percent. I would vigorously\noppose adopting such a stance, and I do not believe my colleagues on the FOMC intended that\ninterpretation either.\nIn addition, at its September meeting, the FOMC decided to begin increasing the size of its\nbalance sheet by purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS. I believe that the\nbenefits of that action are likely to be small, because it’s unlikely to improve growth without also\ncausing an unwelcome increase in inflation. At the same time, adding to our balance sheet\nincreases the risk we will have to move quickly when the time comes to normalize monetary\npolicy and begin raising rates.\nFinally, if we are going to purchase more assets, it would be better to purchase Treasury\nsecurities rather than agency mortgage-backed securities. Buying MBS rather than Treasuries\nmay reduce borrowing rates for conforming home mortgages, but if so, it will raise interest rates\nfor other borrowers and thus distort credit flows. This is an inappropriate role for the Fed, a\nprinciple that was recognized in the Joint Statement of the Department of Treasury and the\nFederal Reserve on March 23, 2009: “Government decisions to influence the allocation of credit\nare the province of the fiscal authorities,” that is, Congress and the administration.\nTo sum up, I am cautiously optimistic about the outlook for growth in output and employment.\nWhile I have objected to some specific monetary policy decisions, the fact that inflation has\nstayed around 2 percent is evidence that monetary policy has done reasonably well in recent\nyears. Maintaining that record of success should be our focus in the years ahead.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nFor an account, see Marvin Goodfriend, “Monetary Policy Comes of Age: A Twentieth Century Odyssey.” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, Winter 1997, vol. 83, no. 1. pp. 1-22.\n3\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.” New and Events,\nMonetary Policy Press Release, January 25, 2012.\n4\nFor a review of the history of the Fed’s mandate, see Aaron Steelman, “The Federal Reserve’s ‘Dual Mandate’:\nThe Evolution of an Idea,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Brief, December 2011.\n5\nGreg Howard, Robert Martin and Beth Anne Wilson, “Are Recoveries from Banking and Financial Crises Really\nSo Different?,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, International Finance Discussion Papers, no.\n1037, November 2011.

            "content": "Challenges to Economic Growth\nOctober 12, 2012\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nUniversity of Virginia, Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy\nCharlottesville, Va.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you today. I seem to have lucked out with my timing. Not only am I\nable to join you in celebrating the five-year anniversary of the Frank Batten School of\nLeadership and Public Policy, but I get to kick off homecoming weekend. I know some of you\nwill be eager to get started, so I’ll try not to keep you too long.\nToday, I plan to share my perspectives on some of the economic challenges facing our country,\nand in doing so provide background on the Federal Reserve’s role on behalf of the nation’s\neconomy. We, too, will be observing an important milestone soon, our centennial. But first, I\nshould share our standard disclaimer ― that the views expressed in this talk are my own and are\nnot necessarily shared by anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nTo start, I’d like to say that I feel an affinity for the Batten School, although this is my first visit\nhere. This is due in part to Gerry Warburg, your assistant dean. He spoke at a gathering at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond last year and then again to our Board of Directors last\nmonth. Warburg was quite enlightening regarding the overall political landscape and the political\nopportunities and pitfalls that may await the Fed in the years ahead. I was delighted to learn that\nhe is related to Paul Warburg, the famous financier who 100 years ago championed the creation\nof our nation’s central bank. He helped author the first draft of the bill that would ultimately\nbecome the Federal Reserve Act, which was signed into law on December 23, 1913.\nNot only did Paul Warburg campaign for a central bank, he served on the Board of Governors in\nthe Fed’s early years and wrote a detailed book explaining the operation of the Fed for the\ngeneral public. 2 Anyone who has taken a good look at the Fed’s structure can appreciate why\nsomeone would see the need for a book explaining who the Fed is and what it does. I plan to say\na bit more about our complicated structure in a moment.\nAnother link to the Batten School is that I feel a bit of an indirect connection to Frank Batten Sr.\nhimself. A man named Lemuel Lewis served as the chairman of the Richmond Fed board of\ndirectors a few years back, and he worked for Frank Batten at Landmark Media Enterprises for\nmany years. (The company was formerly known as Landmark Communications.) Lem was quite\ngenerous with his praise for Frank Batten and spoke warmly of the tremendous difference he\nmade in his professional and personal life. I can well understand why your school’s report uses\nthe word “revered” regarding your school’s namesake.\n1\n\n\fFrank Batten’s vision for this school was to bring together teaching and research concerning the\npractice of leadership in the public policy realm. As a Reserve Bank president, it has been a\nunique privilege to be able to participate in such a unique American policy-making institution.\nI’ve had a ringside seat for, and at times have participated in, some of the most significant\neconomic policy challenges of recent years. I’ve seen firsthand the enormous demands placed on\nthe leaders of such policy institutions. So I heartily endorse the creation of educational\ninstitutions founded on this compelling vision.\nThe notion that economic policy requires highly collaborative leadership skills will resonate with\nanyone with a good working knowledge of the Fed. Our nation’s monetary policy is entrusted to\na relatively large deliberative body called the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, which\nconsists of 12 voting members. Seven are the members of the Fed’s Board of Governors, and\nfive voting members are drawn on a rotating basis from the ranks of the 12 regional Reserve\nBank presidents. 3 All 19 of us ― the seven governors and all 12 Reserve Bank presidents ―\nparticipate fully in each meeting.\nA word about the Reserve Banks. While the Board of Governors is a federal agency, the regional\nReserve Banks are independently chartered banks empowered under the Federal Reserve Act to\nprovide clearing and settlement services for our nation’s banking system and for the U.S.\nTreasury. In addition, Reserve Bank staff members supervise financial system entities on behalf\nof the Board of Governors and conduct economic research in support of the Fed’s monetary and\nfinancial policy mission. In all, the expenses associated with Reserve Bank operations total more\nthan $3 billion. So you can see that leadership challenges within the Fed come in many varieties.\nThe design of this collaborative structure was quite deliberate and reflected the vision of, among\nothers, Carter Glass of Lynchburg, Va. Like Frank Batten Sr., Glass was a newspaper editor by\ntrade. He also served in the U.S. House of Representatives and later in the U.S. Senate. While in\nthe House in 1913, Glass led the effort to pass the Federal Reserve Act, and while in the Senate\nin the 1930s, he played a crucial role in Depression-era banking legislation, including the\nBanking Act of 1935, which established the FOMC. Glass insisted on a federated structure of\ngeographically dispersed reserve banks so they would understand and remain connected to the\ndiverse regional economies that make up our huge country. He strongly opposed the proposals of\nsome ― including, I have to add, Paul Warburg ― that would have concentrated power in a\nsingle centralized financial institution.\nThis federated structure ensures that a wide range of perspectives are brought to bear on policy\nquestions. Moreover, the Fed’s structure blends public and private governance. Each Reserve\nBank is overseen by its own Board of Directors consisting of private citizens, drawn from\nvarious walks of life. Each Reserve Bank president is appointed by his Board of Directors,\nsubject to the approval of the Board of Governors. This provides a measure of insulation for\nmonetary policy decision-making from the short-run pressures associated with electoral politics,\nand thereby allows a longer-term focus, which is essential for good monetary policy.\nMuch that is distinctive about the Federal Reserve’s leadership culture derives, I believe, from\nour federated structure. It’s often observed that the Fed is an exceptionally collegial institution,\n2\n\n\fand that is quite consistent with my experience. You can see this in the transcripts of FOMC\nmeetings, which are released to the public with a five-year lag. (They are posted on the Board’s\nwebsite, federalreserve.org.) You’ll notice there is a certain gentile formality about the\nproceedings, so participants are referred to as, for example, “President Plosser,” “Governor\nDuke,” and so on. Ben Bernanke is addressed as “Mr. Chairman.”\nMore substantively, reading the transcripts reveals the lengths to which the Committee goes to\nreach a workable consensus. Policy alternatives are circulated a week in advance, and\nparticipants are polled as to whether they span the range of plausible alternatives ― that is, could\nyou support one of them? At the meeting, after a set of staff briefings, each participant provides\nan extensive statement on their views about the economy. Presidents usually include their views\non economic conditions in their District. Another go-round follows in which participants express\ntheir views on policy alternatives. By the time the Chairman puts a proposal on the table, a\nworkable consensus is generally clear. At times, this is followed by some surprisingly efficient\ncollective wordsmithing, in which the language of the statement is tweaked here and there to\nbetter express the Committee’s intent. A final roll call concludes, and only then would an\nobserver realize which participants were voters and which ones were not.\nThis deliberative process is laborious and time-consuming and is supported by large staffs\ndedicated to research and analysis, both at the Board and the Reserve Banks. This makes sense in\nlight of the potentially serious consequences of FOMC decisions for millions of Americans. But\nI also believe that our federated structure contributes to the strong sense of collegiality that\npervades the Fed. The fact that the regional Reserve Bank presidents derive their authority from\ndistinct independent governance bodies has a leveling effect on deliberations, I believe. As a\nresult, FOMC participants expect their colleagues to bring their best independent judgments on\nthe policy problems at hand and to listen thoughtfully to alternative perspectives. In my view,\nthis results in a high-quality deliberative process.\nAs a voting member of the FOMC this year, I have found myself at times within ― and at times\noutside ― the workable consensus and sometimes both at the same meeting! For example, I have\nagreed with the Committee’s decision to keep interest rates near zero, since our economy is\ngrowing at only a relatively modest pace. In such an environment, low interest rates and the\ncorresponding monetary stimulus are needed to keep inflation from falling below the\nCommittee’s 2 percent objective.\nOn certain key points, however, I’ve disagreed with the Committee’s other voting members and\nas a result, I have dissented at all six FOMC meetings this year. Let me explain. At each meeting\nthis year, the Committee has issued “forward guidance,” that is, language stating that economic\nconditions are likely to warrant a federal funds rate near zero for at least several years. I have\nobjected to that language because it’s a highly imperfect way to communicate about future\npolicy. Such language could be misinterpreted as suggesting a diminished commitment to\nkeeping inflation at 2 percent. I would oppose adopting such a stance, and I do not believe my\ncolleagues on the FOMC intended that interpretation.\nIn addition, at its September meeting, the FOMC decided to begin increasing the size of its\nbalance sheet by purchasing mortgage-backed securities. I believe that the benefits of that action\n3\n\n\fare likely to be small, because it’s unlikely to improve growth without also causing an\nunwelcome increase in inflation. At the same time, adding to our balance sheet increases the\nrisks we’ll have to move quickly when the time comes to normalize monetary policy and begin\nraising rates.\nFinally, if we were to purchase more assets, I would’ve preferred to purchase Treasury securities\nrather than agency mortgage-backed securities. Buying mortgage backed securities rather than\nTreasuries may reduce borrowing rates for conforming home mortgages, but if so, it will raise\ninterest rates for other borrowers and thus distort credit flows. This is an inappropriate role for\nthe Fed, a principle that was recognized in the Joint Statement of the Department of Treasury and\nthe Federal Reserve on March 23, 2009: “Government decisions to influence the allocation of\ncredit are the province of the fiscal authorities,” that is, Congress and the administration.\nAs I said, our economy is on a relatively sluggish path of recovery from the sharp contraction in\nactivity that occurred in the Great Recession of 2008–09. We lost over 8 million jobs in the\nrecession and its immediate aftermath. Since then, we’ve added about 4 1/4 million net new jobs,\nwhich leaves us far from a full recovery. Similarly, the unemployment rate rose from 5 percent at\nthe end of 2007 to over 10 percent near the end of 2009. While the unemployment rate has fallen\nto 7.8 percent in the most recent report, the decline has been disappointingly slow.\nThere are several factors that appear to be impeding a more rapid recovery in labor market\nconditions right now. First, the housing market is still coping with the large inventory overhang\nthat remains from the prerecession boom. This sector has begun to show some encouraging\nsigns, with home prices and construction improving this year. But housing investment is still\nquite low relative to historical norms, and it will continue to underperform until the demand for\nhousing makes more progress catching up to the existing housing stock.\nSecond, and related, was the significant shift in economic activity away from residential\nconstruction and related supply industries. The rapid loss of jobs in these industries, layered on\ntop of ongoing longer-run sectoral shifts, resulted in large inflows into the ranks of the\nunemployed. The resulting shift in the skill profile of available workers has meant that the\nreallocation and skill mismatch frictions affecting labor markets are at a relatively high level.\nThird, the Great Recession appears to have made many consumers more cautious and less\nwilling to spend, relative to their income and wealth. The declines in income and wealth during\nthe recent recession were far greater than in other recent recessions. As a result, consumers have\nbecome more apprehensive about their future income prospects, which have tempered the growth\nin consumer spending.\nFinally, the political gridlock that has delayed remedies to our unsustainable federal fiscal path\nhas meant paralyzing uncertainty across the vast range of fiscal policy touch points in the\neconomy. This appears to have seriously dampened investments and hiring for the new business\nventures that typically would take up the economic slack caused by one sector’s decline. Should\nthey all take effect, the spending cuts and tax increases that will automatically occur next year if\nCongress fails to act ― the so-called “fiscal cliff” ― will likely cause the economy to contract\nand move back into a recession. On the other hand, the longer-run federal fiscal outlook is a\n4\n\n\fsignificant imbalance between taxes and spending. I’m sure you are familiar with projections by\nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, showing that the outstanding stock of federal debt\nis likely to increase without bound as a ratio to gross domestic product. This is not a feasible\nscenario and cannot persist indefinitely. At some point Congress will have to align taxes and\nspending. The set of policy changes that could conceivably be adopted affect almost every\nAmerican consumer or business in a meaningful way.\nSo where do we go from here? My best guess is that growth will begin to firm later next year and\ncontinue to improve beyond that. While the recession in Europe poses risks for this outlook, I\nthink those risks will likely dissipate next year as leaders work through the adjustments\nnecessary for creating a new fiscal regime. As U.S. labor markets continue to heal, I expect\nhousehold confidence to slowly firm and bolster consumer spending.\nThe fundamental prospects for longer-term U.S. growth remain quite promising, in my view, and\nare likely to reassert themselves in the years ahead. We have a proven ability to generate\nadvances in scientific knowledge and commercial innovation. The flexibility and resilience of\nour markets, along with a relatively well-educated populace, make this an excellent market in\nwhich to implement innovations. Our major challenge over the long haul is to deepen the\nknowledge and skills of our people, because growing our human capital is fundamental to\nimproving our standards of living.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nPaul M.

The Committee\nreleased a statement after the meeting saying that it expects a highly accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable period after the economic recovery\nstrengthens, and that it currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds\nrate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.\n\"I dissented because I opposed additional asset purchases at this time. Further monetary\nstimulus now is unlikely to result in a discernible improvement in growth, but if it does, it’s also\nlikely to cause an unwanted increase in inflation.\n\"Economic activity has been growing, on average, at a modest pace, and inflation has been\nfluctuating around 2 percent, which the Committee has identified as its inflation goal.\nUnemployment does remain high by historical standards, but improvement in labor market\nconditions appears to have been held back by real impediments that are beyond the capacity of\nmonetary policy to offset. In such circumstances, further monetary stimulus runs the risk of\nraising inflation in a way that threatens the stability of inflation expectations.\n\"I also dissented because I disagreed with the characterization of the time period over which the\nstance of monetary policy would be highly accommodative and the federal funds rate would be\nexceptionally low. I believe that such an implied commitment to provide stimulus beyond the\npoint at which the recovery strengthens and growth increases would be inconsistent with a\nbalanced approach to the FOMC’s price stability and maximum employment mandates.\n\"Finally, I strongly opposed purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities. These\npurchases are intended to reduce borrowing rates for conforming home mortgages. Such\npurchases, as compared to purchases of an equivalent amount of U.S. Treasury securities,\ndistort investment allocations and raise interest rates for other borrowers.

            "content": "Technology, Unemployment and Workforce Development in a Rapidly Changing World\nMay 7, 2012\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nProximity Hotel\nGreensboro, N.C.\n\nMy colleagues from the Richmond Fed and I are in the Greensboro area for several days to meet\nwith local business and community leaders to learn firsthand about emerging economic issues.\nTrips like these around our District are vital to our understanding of the dynamics of economic\ngrowth. In fact, what we have heard at other events and learned from other contacts motivates\nmy talk with you here this evening. Before I begin, however, I need to note that the views I\nexpress tonight are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System. 1\nIn recent months, many of our business contacts have reported that although demand is\nbeginning to increase, they are unable to respond as quickly as they would like due to an inability\nto find skilled workers. While the need for skilled workers may seem obvious in high-tech\nindustries such as biotechnology or nanoscience — two industries that have a strong presence in\nNorth Carolina — the shortage of skilled labor appears to be more widespread. Businesses\nranging from auto repair shops to hardware stores also have reported difficulty filling open\npositions.\nThe increasing demand for skilled workers across many industries is not a new phenomenon.\nIndeed, one of the first speeches I gave as president of the Richmond Fed was right here in\nGreensboro in 2005 on the subject of the effect of technology on labor markets. 2 At that time, I\ndiscussed the increasing gap in wages between high-skill and low-skill workers — what\neconomists call the “skill premium.” Between 1970 and 2000, the skill premium increased\nsignificantly, as did overall wage inequality. By 2000, full-time workers in the 90th percentile of\nwages were earning about four and a half times as much as those in the 10th percentile,\ncompared to three and a half times as much in 1970. 3\nSkill-Biased Technological Change\nThe increase in the skill premium reflects changes in the supply of and demand for particular\ntypes of workers. Typically, an increase in the supply of something (in this case, skilled workers)\ndecreases the price (in this case, the wage). While the number of college graduates grew\n1\n\n\fsignificantly in the second half of the 20th century, the price for their labor also continued to\nincrease. 4 This must mean that the relative demand for their services was growing even faster\nthan the supply.\nEconomists have traced the increase in the relative wages of skilled workers to a phenomenon\ncalled “skill-biased technological change,” which occurs when new technologies increase the\nproductivity of skilled workers relative to less-skilled workers. Many of today’s factory floors,\nfor example, feature “computer numeric controlled” machines, which require a specialized\nknowledge to operate. A worker with these skills can produce more output in less time than a\nworker operating more traditional manufacturing equipment.\nManufacturing employment has been declining steadily for several decades, which illustrates\nanother feature of skill-biased technological change: It can be disruptive for workers who find\nthat the demand for their skills has declined. Job or wage losses are painful for those workers and\ncommunities that are affected. But the continual destruction and creation of jobs is part of the\nprocess that Joseph Schumpeter termed “creative destruction,” by which the implementation of\nnew technologies raises productivity and standards of living for the economy as a whole.\nRecessions disturb that process, as gross job destruction increases sharply and gross job creation\ninitially falls. As the economy recovers, job destruction falls and job creation gradually picks up,\nleading to a return of net job creation. This certainly characterizes the recession we just went\nthrough. Although the job destruction rate is actually below its prerecession levels, the job\ncreation rate remains historically low, and thus, net employment gains have been relatively weak\nover the course of this recovery.\nFurther research conducted since my 2005 speech has added some nuances to the story of skillbiased technological change. For example, if we define skill by educational attainment, only\nworkers with post-graduate degrees experienced consistent real wage gains since the 1960s.\nWorkers with lower educational attainments saw their wages increase overall since the 1960s,\nbut they also experienced intermittent periods with declining or stagnant wages. If on the other\nhand, we define skill by the ranking in the income distribution, the wage gap between the 90th\nand 10th percentiles has continued to increase. But even this comparison between low and high\nincome groups hides changes in the middle of the income distribution. Again, only the upper\nincome groups saw consistent real wage gains for the period since 1960. The pattern for the\nlower income groups is more complicated. In particular, while the 50/10 gap — the gap between\nworkers at the median and the bottom of the distribution — also increased before the 1990s, it\nhas narrowed since. This apparent “wage polarization” since the mid-1990s — wage gains for\nthe lowest and highest income groups, but stagnant wages for the middle groups — has raised\nsome questions about the simplest models of skill-biased technological change. It suggests a\nmore complex picture that distinguishes between skills, which are inherent to the workers, and\ntasks, which are inherent to jobs. 5 If technological change makes certain tasks more vulnerable to\nautomation, then the workers assigned to those tasks will be displaced and may have to accept\nnew jobs at lower wages. In this case, mid- or even higher-skilled workers may be adversely\naffected by technological innovation if their tasks are routine from an IT perspective.\n\n2\n\n\fLabor Markets After the Great Recession\nAs you probably know, this recent recession was the most severe since the Great Depression, and\njob losses were felt across all skill levels and demographic groups. The unemployment rate rose\nfrom about 4-½ percent before the recession to over 10 percent in late 2009. Only in the past six\nmonths has the unemployment rate fallen below 9 percent, most recently to 8.1 percent in April.\nMore than 40 percent of those unemployed — approximately 5.1 million people — have been\nlooking for work for more than six months. By historical standards, this recovery has\nunderperformed on net job creation.\nMany economists have tried to determine the extent to which elevated unemployment reflects a\nbroad deficiency in spending, which presumably could be offset through monetary policy\nstimulus or instead reflects changes in economic fundamentals, such as the decline of certain\nindustries, changing technologies or demographic shifts. Sometimes the former is referred to as\n“cyclical unemployment,” and the latter is referred to as “structural unemployment.” But these\nterms can be quite misleading because cyclical downturns are often associated with substantial\nshifts across economic sectors. Indeed, the proximate cause of the last recession was a collapse\nin residential construction and related industries, which have yet to recover and are unlikely to\nrecover fully anytime soon, given the substantial remaining overhang in housing inventory. The\nbroader point to bear in mind is that recoveries are not always the mirror image of the\ncontraction that preceded them.\nWhile quantifying the contributions to unemployment of structural economic factors versus\nspending is quite difficult, our sense is that structural factors are playing a considerable role. As I\nmentioned earlier, we have heard from a number of employers who are having trouble hiring,\ndespite the large pool of unemployed workers, and surveys by other Reserve Banks have\nreported this same finding. This suggests that there is some degree of “mismatch” between the\nskills demanded by employers and the skills available in the pool of potential workers.\nSkills Mismatch\nThis mismatch argument is not based solely on anecdotes, though. One broad quantitative\nmeasure of mismatch comes from what’s called “the Beveridge curve,” which refers to the\nrelationship between unemployment and vacancies. Since the recession ended, that curve has\ndeparted from its prerecession position. Typically when the number of vacancies is low,\nunemployment is high, since workers are competing for a limited number of open positions.\nConversely, when vacancies tend to be high, unemployment tends to be low. At present,\nhowever, both the unemployment and vacancy rates are relatively high, which suggests that\nunemployed workers are not finding jobs as rapidly as usual, despite the large number of open\npositions. This apparent outward shift in the Beveridge curve suggests that labor markets have\nbecome less effective at matching workers and vacancies. Empirical estimates suggest that this\nreduced efficiency could account for between ½ and 1-½ percentage points of unemployment. 6\nWhat could account for the reduced effectiveness of labor market matching? One widely cited\nreport by New York Fed economists estimates that the misallocation of workers across different\n3\n\n\fjob markets could account for between 0.6 and 1.7 percentage points of the total rise in the\nunemployment rate. 7 This might seem to be a small difference, but in the context of a 5-½\npercentage point increase in the unemployment rate in this recession, 1.7 percentage points is, in\nfact, sizeable.\nIt’s worth noting that research such as the New York Fed study typically relies on data based on\nthe occupational categories used for government statistical reporting, many of which include a\nwide range of positions — some of which are in high demand and some of which are not.\nAggregating these jobs together can obscure the degree of mismatch that actually exists.\nMoreover, reports from our contacts suggest that changing skill requirements within industry\nsectors is important as well. Many construction firms, for example, are seeking skilled tradesmen\nor workers with expertise in new environmental technologies. One widely used metaphor for the\nexistence of mismatch is the costliness of turning construction workers into nurses — but it also\nmay be difficult to turn the construction workers of yesterday into the construction workers of\ntomorrow.\nIn this context, the rise in long-term unemployment across a wide range of occupational and\nindustry groups provides additional evidence that mismatch is an important factor restraining\nlabor market performance. Economists at the Richmond Fed have studied the rate at which\nworkers “exit” from unemployment — that is, the likelihood that a given worker finds a job in\nthe next period. Some workers enter unemployment with high exit rates — they are able to find\njobs relatively quickly. Some workers enter unemployment with low exit rates.\nUsing detailed population survey data, our Bank’s researchers were able to infer the sizes of\nthese different groups of workers each month as well as the rates at which they find jobs and exit\nfrom unemployment. Their results indicate that, similar to past recessions, the increase in\nunemployment was attributable mainly to the decline in job-finding rates for both groups. But\nthey also found that a large portion of the dramatic rise in long-term unemployment can be\nexplained by the relative decline in the exit rates of workers who began unemployment with an\ninherently low exit rate. Between 1-½ and 2-½ percentage points of increased unemployment in\nthe most recent recession is attributable, in their framework, to the decline in the relative exit rate\nof hard-to-employ unemployed workers. This is consistent with the idea that many of the longterm unemployed had been working in declining industries or occupations and cannot easily\ntransfer their skills to newly available jobs. 8\nPolicy Responses\nWhat does the preceding discussion suggest about possible policy responses to current labor\nmarket conditions? One standard option is to increase unemployment insurance benefits in order\nto offset households’ loss of purchasing power. Congress routinely expands such benefits in\nresponse to recessions, and this recession has been no exception. It’s worth pointing out,\nhowever, that as beneficial as such insurance programs can be, they also can affect the incentives\nto look for work or accept employment offers. Thus, they may actually increase the\nunemployment rate and the duration of unemployment. These potential costs have to be weighed\nagainst our desire to help those who are suffering from job loss. We should also keep these\nincentive effects in mind when interpreting unemployment rate data. Recent estimates suggest\n4\n\n\fthat between 0.8 and 1.7 percentage points of elevated unemployment may be attributable to\nextended unemployment benefit programs. 9\nIt’s worth noting, by the way, that the effects of unemployment insurance benefits together with\nthe effects of labor market inefficiencies could plausibly account for a quite substantial portion\nof our elevated unemployment rate. The quantitative estimates of labor market mismatch come\nfrom independent methods and datasets and, in principle, measure conceptually distinct\ninefficiencies. We shouldn’t necessarily assume these effects are additive, but combining all\nthree together yields a range of 2.9 to 5.9 percentage points, which is sizable relative to the\nincrease in the total unemployment rate of 5-½ percentage points during the recession.\nAnother option is accommodative monetary policy in an effort to boost aggregate spending. The\nFed has kept its target for the federal funds rate at between zero and 25 basis points since the end\nof 2008 and has engaged in a variety of asset purchase programs in an effort to provide\nadditional stimulus to the economy. Some commentators are urging the Fed to take additional\naction as long as the unemployment rate remains elevated. But if elevated unemployment reflects\nlargely fundamental factors rather than insufficient spending, such stimulus might have little\nimpact on unemployment and instead just raise the risk of pushing inflation up.\nThe notion that skills mismatch is constraining labor market improvements suggests a third\npolicy approach: investing in job training and education. While perhaps not a quick resolution to\nthe current unemployment problem, I believe such investments are likely to yield greater benefits\nfor both workers and the economy as a whole than efforts aimed at providing short-term\nstimulus. As I have noted, improvement in the skill level of the workforce eventually leads to\nboth higher productivity and wages.\nHowever, we should be careful to not simply throw more training dollars at our workforce. Even\nrelatively high levels of education are no guarantee against workforce displacement due to\ntechnological change, as demonstrated by the recent deterioration in incomes near the median of\nthe wage distribution. And to the extent that there is mismatch within rather than across sectors,\nprograms designed to turn former mortgage brokers and construction workers into nurses and\nsolar panel installers may not get at the heart of the problem. Instead, we should think carefully\nabout the strategies that are likely to create the best matches between employers and employees.\nWorkforce Development\nOne type of education that clearly seems to be effective — although it might not be the first thing\nthat comes to mind when thinking about job training — is early childhood education. Decades of\nresearch, including a seminal study conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,\nhave shown that programs that promote cognitive development in early childhood can have a\nprofound impact on lifelong skill attainment. Investments in early education have the potential\nfor compounding, since they enhance the ability of a child to learn throughout his or her lifetime.\nI believe there is a strong case for making early childhood education affordable and widely\navailable.\n\n5\n\n\fThe case for federal investment in large-scale job training programs later in life is less clear,\nbecause there are questions about the ability of a government agency to independently identify\nand target the appropriate skills. Instead, we should look to demand-driven programs that are\nclosely linked to local business conditions and labor markets, or that pair investments in human\ncapital with investments in physical capital.\nThere are many examples of such programs in the Richmond Fed’s Fifth District, particularly in\nNorth Carolina — which in 1958 became the first state to offer company-specific customized\ntraining programs. These programs have been the bread and butter of the state’s community\ncollege system, and North Carolina remains a national leader in workforce development training.\nGuilford Technical Community College, where we’ll be visiting tomorrow, works with\ncompanies such as Machine Specialties Inc., TIMCO and HondaJet to ensure that the students at\nits Advanced Manufacturing Training Facility are learning the skills that these employers really\nneed. At Central Piedmont Community College, students in Apprenticeship 2000 complete a\nfour-year training program that ends with the promise of a job at one of the program’s partner\ncompanies. CPCC is also the first community college in the United States to offer training\nprograms certified by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with the goal of making\nworkers a better match with the 500 German companies in the Carolinas — 200 of which are in\nthe Charlotte area.\nOthers are also stepping in to support these efforts. The Golden LEAF Foundation, for example,\nis developing a new “mid-skills” training initiative to prepare students for jobs in high-demand\nareas such as welding, machining, automation, and industrial systems and maintenance. The\nFoundation looks to provide up to $8 million in 2012–13 to support community colleges and\nother direct training providers, and it is working closely with the private sector to ensure that the\nprograms are tied to identifiable employment opportunities.\nTraining programs like these throughout the Piedmont Triad area and North Carolina provide\nuseful examples of public-private human capital investments that are responsive to changing\nlocal economic conditions. Although manufacturing employment in the state has declined nearly\n50 percent in the past two decades, we are now seeing an influx of aerospace and other high-tech\nmanufacturers, as well as a host of new workforce development initiatives to complement them.\nThese are exemplary responses, in my view, to the challenge posed by current labor market\nconditions. Because they are locally based and paired with investments in physical capital, they\nseem much more likely to provide training that can lead to productive employment. And the\nrange of coursework provided through the community college system means that technologyspecific training can be complemented with more general skill development in science,\nmathematics and language skills, which can benefit workers beyond their next job.\nLabor Markets in a Rapidly Changing World\nThe unavoidable reality facing modern labor markets is the rapidly changing world in which they\nfunction. The astonishing current pace of technological innovation means there is always a risk\nthat skills demanded today will not be demanded tomorrow. But by the same token, new skills\n6\n\n\fare likely to be needed to implement the innovations that enhance productivity and raise\nstandards of living over time. While this Schumpeterian process can be costly to displaced\nworkers, the microeconomic perspective that I have outlined tonight suggests that additional\nfillips of aggregate spending are unlikely to be an effective policy response. Sometimes, the best\nresponse to an ailing garden is not to simply water more often; sometimes, it’s more useful to roll\nup your sleeves and give each plant the water, nutrients and careful cultivation that match its\nspecific needs.\nThese emerging models of workforce development might not offer a rapid solution to the\nproblem of elevated unemployment, or immediate relief to the millions of Americans who have\nbeen out of work for far too long. Even in the best of circumstances, the process of transferring\nworkers to different occupations and industries takes time. But, the future health of the labor\nmarket and the resilience of the economy as a whole are likely to be best served by human\ncapital investments that are well-adapted to the diffuse, local nature of emerging economic\nopportunities.\n1\n2\n\nI am grateful to Jessie Romero and Andreas Hornstein for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nJeffrey Lacker, “Technology and Labor Markets.” Speech at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro,\nJanuary 18, 2005.\n3\nDavid Autor and Daron Acemoglu, “Skills, Tasks, and Technologies: Implications for Employment and Earnings,”\nin Handbook of Labor Economics, Orley Ashenfelter and David Card, eds., Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2012.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, May 2012\nMay 2, 2012\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nEconomics Club of Hampton Roads Economic Conference\nSheraton Waterside Hotel\nNorfolk, Va.\nIt’s a pleasure to discuss the economic outlook with you today. My plan is to discuss prospects\nfor economic growth and inflation over the next few years, and then share some thoughts about\nthe outlook for monetary policy over that time horizon. 1 As always, the views expressed are my\nown and may not reflect those of my colleagues within the Federal Reserve System.\nTo set the stage for a look ahead, let’s start by taking a look at how far we’ve come since the\ndramatic contraction in economic activity that we suffered in 2008 and the first half of 2009.\nSince the second quarter of 2009, real income has increased 4.8 percent, consumer spending has\nrisen 6.1 percent and real gross domestic product (GDP), our best measure of overall economic\nactivity, has risen 6.8 percent. Moreover, we have added over 3.5 million net new jobs since total\nemployment bottomed out early in 2010. The record shows that we’ve made considerable\nprogress in recovering from the Great Recession, as it’s been called.\nAnd yet, for many observers, this performance has been sorely disappointing, and the reasons are\nunderstandable. Looking back to two other U.S. recessions that were nearly as deep ― 1974-75\nand 1981-82 ― real GDP expanded at rates more like 5 or 6 percent per year coming out of\nthose recessions. 2 Similarly, the current unemployment rate of 8.2 percent is viewed as relatively\nelevated, whereas numbers like 5 or 6 percent are viewed as more normal. Clearly, a substantial\nnumber of Americans are seeking suitable employment, but have not been able to do so. For\nmany of them, the moderate pace of this expansion has meant significant economic hardship.\nSome critics see this moderate pace of expansion as prima facie evidence that the Federal\nReserve should provide more economic stimulus in order to boost growth. I disagree, as I will\nattempt to explain. While frustration with current economic conditions is understandable, our\neconomy’s performance is nonetheless comprehensible, given what has befallen us over the last\nfew years. Moreover, the reasons for more moderate growth suggest that further monetary\nstimulus is not likely to be of much help. So, before talking about the outlook, I’d like to take a\ncloser look at the most likely reasons for our muted growth rate.\n\n1\n\n\fThe most obvious factor holding back this recovery is the lingering depression in new home\nconstruction. In past recessions, homebuilding fell sharply but invariably snapped back rapidly at\nthe outset of the recovery, with growth rates of 30 percent or more not uncommon.\nHomebuilding fell sharply in this recession ― 73 percent from the peak ― but has barely\nincreased since. That leaves housing starts running at a rate about half of what we saw in the\n1990s, before the latest housing boom and bust cycle.\nSeveral forces are holding the housing market down. First ― and foremost ― is that we built\nmany more homes during the boom than it turned out were needed to accommodate population\ngrowth and rising incomes. As a result, in many parts of the country, there are more homes than\nhouseholds want to own. Second, it’s now clear that mortgage underwriting standards were too\nlax during the height of the housing boom. While this is often attributed to fraud and lax\nsupervision, one has to include the pervasive effects of the distorted incentives and moral hazard\nassociated with financial entities viewed as too big to fail, both here and abroad. 3 Such\ninstitutions were prone to undervaluing the risks associated with mortgage lending. Their\ndemand for mortgage-backed securities played a significant role in weakening lending standards,\nwhich in turn played a significant role in driving the demand for housing. The end result was\nmany areas with large numbers of vacant houses.\nIn the wake of widespread losses on mortgage lending, underwriting standards have become\nsignificantly more conservative since the height of the housing boom, and this is another factor\nrestraining housing demand. We should expect tighter credit terms in most markets in a\ndownturn because any given loan will look riskier in a weak economy. Moreover, the housing\nbust taught us that some innovative mortgage lending products were unprofitable without rapid\nhome price appreciation, and importantly, that the risk of a broad, sustained fall in housing prices\nwas much larger than had been believed. Borrowers and lenders alike now have a much greater\nappreciation for the economic risks associated with highly leveraged home ownership. In that\nlight, a highly cautious attitude toward home ownership and mortgage debt makes abundant\nsense.\nFor all these reasons, a lengthy adjustment process in housing seems inevitable. Population\ngrowth will gradually absorb some of the vacant properties, and income growth will lead some\nhouseholds to move up to larger homes and others to return to owning a second home. Housing\nproperties in less desirable locations or needing extensive repairs may never be occupied. Apart\nfrom the imbalance of aggregate demand and supply of housing, the housing boom and bust also\nhas resulted in a substantial number of households for whom the home they occupy is a poor\nmatch in terms of affordability. While many of these cases of mismatch are being resolved\nvoluntarily as people sell homes and move into smaller quarters or rental units, many are being\nresolved through the painful and time-consuming mortgage foreclosure process.\nOver time, we’ll see a better match between households and the housing they want to own or\nrent, and in an increasing number of local markets, we will see the overhang of vacant homes\ndiminish to the point that significant construction increases are warranted. It’s hard to predict just\nwhen these tipping points will be reached, and we will need to build houses at a rate in line with\nthe growth in the number of households, but my sense is that we are several years away.\n\n2\n\n\fThat said, we are seeing some bright spots. In many areas, rental vacancy rates have fallen, rents\nhave increased, and as a result, the construction of multifamily rental units is rising, consistent\nwith a broad shift away from owner-occupancy. In fact, virtually all of the recovery in housing\nstarts has been multifamily units. It’s worth noting that home improvement spending is also on\nthe rise, consistent with a dampened desire to trade up to larger homes. But even with these\npositive factors, residential investment is now only 2-¼ percent of GDP ― compared to over 6\npercent of GDP at the peak. So housing still is likely to contribute far less to overall economic\ngrowth than in past recoveries.\nMany of the factors holding back growth in this expansion can be traced to fallout from the\nhousing bust. The huge decline in housing prices from 2006 to 2009 erased a large portion of the\nhome equity that households had accumulated during the boom. And in late 2008 and early 2009,\nhouseholds lost another large chunk of wealth to a rapidly falling stock market. This\ndeterioration in their net worth gave consumers ample reason to rein in spending, pay down debt\nand rebuild balance sheets, both in the recession and in the recovery that followed.\nConsumer spending has been much more sluggish in this recovery than in the typical recovery,\nrising at only a 2.1 percent annual rate since the end of the recession. Part of the explanation was\nthe reduction in net worth, as I said, but more important has been the deterioration in labor\nmarket conditions. We lost over 8 million jobs, on net, during the recession and its immediate\naftermath. Since bottoming out in early 2010, we’ve added 3.5 million jobs, which is less than\nhalfway back to the level of employment we had attained in 2007. Moreover, hourly earnings\nhave decelerated from 4 percent before the recession to 2 percent now. Thus, the weak labor\nmarket has held down wage and salary income, which has hindered consumer spending growth.\nOne impediment to more rapid employment growth is the extent of the mismatch between the\nskills of unemployed workers and the skills sought by firms seeking to hire. Recessions and\nrecoveries always involve shifting resources from declining industries to expanding industries in\nresponse to emerging technologies and new patterns of demand; expansions are often not the\nmirror image of the preceding contraction. While many workers who lose jobs in a downturn will\nfind jobs in newly expanding firms as the economy recovers, the search process that connects\nunemployed workers to new jobs can be lengthy and can require significant training. The costs\nand delays associated with reallocating workers to expanding industries can elevate\nunemployment and impede the rate of job growth. The extent of this type of skills mismatch is\ndifficult to measure with any precision, but my reading, based on both statistical research and\ninformal contacts with businesses in our District, is that mismatch is a significant factor in the\nlabor market weakness we are seeing today.\nFortunately, we have seen some improvement in labor markets. Job growth has fluctuated from\nquarter to quarter, but overall appears to have accelerated as the expansion has gone on. In the\nfirst 18 months after employment bottomed out, we added 125,000 jobs per month; in the last\nseven months that increased to 190,000 jobs per month. The improved pace of job growth may\nbe giving consumers more confidence in their future labor market prospects, leading them to\nloosen their purse strings. We are actually seeing evidence of that. Household spending rose at\nmore than a 3-½ percent annual rate in the first three months of this year. Moreover, spending\n\n3\n\n\fhas been strong in the new car and truck market, where unit sales increased 8 percent in the\nfourth quarter last year and another 7.6 in the first quarter this year.\nSo far, I’ve discussed two impediments to growth that appear to have been important lately ―\nthe overbuilt housing market and labor market mismatch. Another impediment to growth cited\nby many observers is the array of changes in tax and regulatory policies, both actual and\nanticipated, that makes it difficult for businesses to evaluate the profitability of potential\ninvestment or hiring commitments. We continue to hear widespread and persistent anecdotal\nreports from our contacts in the Fifth Federal Reserve District that new regulations and\nuncertainty about imminent regulations are discouraging firms from hiring or undertaking new\ninvestment projects. While these effects are impossible to quantify, it seems plausible to me that\nthey could be noticeably lowering measured growth rates.\nIn addition, the dire federal budget outlook also poses significant uncertainties for many\nconsumers and businesses. As you are all no doubt aware, the path for federal debt under current\nlaw is simply not feasible. One way or another, significant adjustments will occur. Marginal tax\nrates may increase, the tax base may expand, benefits or entitlement programs may be cut, or\nother government programs may be reduced or eliminated. These changes could be far reaching\nand could affect a large part, if not all, of the population. Uncertainty about just where the\nadjustments will take place ― just where the ax will fall, so to speak ― is likely to be\ndiscouraging hiring and spending. For example, we hear that anticipated defense cuts are already\naffecting employment and investment in the Washington area, as well as the business outlook\nhere in the defense-heavy region around Norfolk. Uncertainty about what specific fiscal actions\nwill be taken in coming years may well be impeding growth throughout the economy.\nThese impediments to growth are important, but they are not the whole story. I don’t want to\npaint too gloomy a picture. One category of economic activity has been living up to our usual\nexpectations of robust growth following a recession. Business investment in equipment and\nsoftware ― our broadest measure of private sector capital formation apart from structures ―\nrose 14.6 percent in 2010 and another 10.4 percent over the course of 2011. Even with overall\nsales growing less rapidly than in the typical recovery, firms continue to identify profitable\nopportunities to deploy capital goods to produce new products and services, reduce costs and\nimprove business processes. This suggests that we are continuing to reap benefits from the\nunderlying forces of innovation and creativity that have supported economic growth in this\ncountry throughout our history.\nThe trade sector has been another contributor to growth in this expansion. Exports, after\nadjusting for inflation, increased over 11 percent in 2010 and over 6-½ percent in 2011, and\nprospects there remain bright. A large fraction of the world’s population resides in countries that\nhave relatively low household income but are growing rapidly. In these emerging economies,\nfirms are deploying capital rapidly to equip growing labor forces, thereby creating a strong\ndemand for technology-intensive American investment goods. And as these more productive\nworkers move into the middle class, they will want to purchase a range of consumer goods from\nthe U.S., from sodas, to movies, to video games. So I expect export growth to continue to add to\noverall economic activity over the near term.\n\n4\n\n\fConsidering all these factors, I come back to the improvement we have seen in the labor market\nrecently. Most forecasts expect job gains to continue this year. That seems reasonable to me and\nwould generate noticeable improvements in consumer incomes and spending that would nudge\nGDP growth higher as well. Next year, we are likely to see further improvement, and I see that\nprocess as gradually lifting growth.\nThis mildly optimistic forecast comes with several caveats, of course. The impediments to\ngrowth that I mentioned are still exerting a drag on activity that will keep growth from being as\nrobust as we would like. In addition, this forecast allows for the mild recession that Europe is\ngoing through, but many European countries have not yet adopted credible policies to achieve\nlong-run fiscal balance. Until they do, further turbulence and a deeper recession there cannot be\nruled out, and that could dampen growth here as well. Finally, my forecast incorporates just a\nminor risk of any large discontinuous fiscal adjustments by our own government.\nNo central banker’s outlook would be complete without a forecast for inflation. Last year, we\nwere reminded that inflation can rise even in the face of elevated unemployment. In 2010, the\ninflation rate was 1.3 percent, but it then more than doubled to 2.7 percent last year, even though\nthe unemployment rate averaged about 9 percent. Despite that run-up, I believe that the inflation\noutlook is reasonably good right now. The most recent reading on inflation is 2.1 percent, on a\nyear-over-year basis. While gasoline prices pushed up the overall inflation rate last year and\nearly this year, gasoline prices have fallen in recent weeks, and futures markets are pricing in\nfurther declines this year.\nMore important, in my view, is that the public’s expectations of future inflation have remained\nwell anchored within the range they have been in for several years. Much of that stability can be\nattributed, I believe, to the Federal Reserve’s consistent pursuit of monetary policy that keeps\ninflation low and stable. Over the past 19 years, inflation has fluctuated around an average of 2\npercent. In January of this year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took a step\nforward by announcing that its specific goal for inflation is 2 percent growth in the price index\nfor personal consumption expenditures. Adopting this goal should eliminate any lingering doubt\nabout the FOMC’s commitment to price stability and should enhance accountability, since it will\nbe obvious how actual inflation compares to the target. While inflation can fluctuate from quarter\nto quarter, over time inflation is the result of monetary policy.\nSpeaking of monetary policy, some of you may have noticed that in all three FOMC meetings\nthis year I have cast a dissenting vote on the Committee’s monetary policy decision. In each\ncase, I objected to a phrase contained in the press release following the meeting. As background,\nbefore last August, the FOMC’s press release following our meeting stated that “the Committee\n… currently anticipates that economic conditions … are likely to warrant exceptionally low\nlevels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.” This has come to be known as our\n“forward guidance language.” At our meeting last August, we changed “for an extended period”\nto “at least through mid-2013,” a more specific calendar-based way of providing forward\nguidance. Then in January, the FOMC voted to change that date to “late 2014.”\nIt’s important to recognize that our forward guidance language is a forecast of how monetary\npolicy will turn out, not an unconditional promise. Future monetary policy decisions will depend\n5\n\n\fon future economic data ― and the future economic outlook. As new data arrive, the outlook for\nfuture economic conditions will change, and the outlook for the future of monetary policy should\nchange as well.\nI dissented in January because I did not believe that economic conditions are likely to warrant\nlow interest rates all the way through 2014. (I was not a voting member last year.) My projection\nis that if we want to keep inflation at 2 percent, we will likely need to raise rates in 2013.\nIncoming data could change my assessment in either direction; weaker data could lead me to\npush out my projection, and stronger data could lead me to advance my projection. I have\ncontinued to dissent against that specific language because my projection continues to differ\nsignificantly from the Committee statement.\nIt may sound strange to talk of raising rates when much of the chatter in financial markets is\nabout the possibility of easier policy. In my view, it would be quite hard to justify additional\nmonetary stimulus, absent a dramatic deterioration in economic conditions, which I do not view\nas likely. The impediments to growth that I have discussed today are all quite real. That is, they\nare factors for which monetary policy is not the remedy. Monetary policy will not occupy vacant\nhomes or give unemployed workers the skills to fill vacant jobs or reduce regulatory and fiscal\nuncertainty. Policy is already quite accommodative. Additional easing is unlikely to have much\npositive effect on growth prospects, but could well generate a sustained surge in inflation that\nwould be costly to reverse.\nSo my outlook is for 2 percent inflation, consistent with the FOMC’s officially articulated goal,\nand I am pleased that we have come through this challenging period with price stability intact. I\nrecognize, however, that sustaining that achievement may require some difficult decisions in the\nmonths and years ahead.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and Laura Fortunato for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nReal GDP grew at an average annual rate of 4.7 percent and 6.3 percent in the eight quarters following the\nrecessions of 1974-75 and 1981-82, respectively.\n3\nJeffrey M.

Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThe Inaugural George and Susan Beischer Address\nThe Banking Institute, UNC School of Law\nCharlotte, N.C.\n\nThank you for this opportunity to speak with you this evening. Three years have passed since the\ndarkest days of the 2007–2009 financial crises. Since then, as is often the case in the wake of\nextreme economic events, we have seen considerable effort devoted to regulatory reform,\nincluding legislative action, supervisory improvements and international collaboration. While\nthis first wave of remediation work has yielded considerable progress, we should be under no\nillusions that the steps taken so far will provide durable and reliable protection against future\ninstability. My view is that without a robust program for repairing the fundamentally flawed\nrelationship between government and the financial sector, the odds are quite high that before\nlong we will face an episode of financial distress just as wrenching as the one we just\nexperienced.\nOne might wonder what remains to be done now that the economy is in recovery and we are well\non the way to implementing the 2,319-page Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act. The Act, however, is a patchwork of provisions, motivated by an array of\nconflicting crisis narratives, and supplemented by an assortment of banking provisions largely\nunrelated to the crisis. The law does some very good things and some arguably\ncounterproductive things, but it leaves many important things undone. With the financial crisis\nlargely abated, at least on this side of the Atlantic, this strikes me as a good time to step back,\nreflect on what we’ve learned and consider what steps to take next. Our path forward will be\nmuch more constructive if it’s grounded in a reasonably coherent understanding of the tradeoffs\ninherent in financial stability policy—and of how the crisis came to pass.\nIn our time together tonight, I will outline a broad agenda for achieving a sustainable and\neffective relationship between the government and the financial sector―a “program for financial\nstability,” if you will. 1 This program is based on what I believe is the most compelling\nassessment of the causes of the crisis, one that emphasizes the role of the financial safety net in\nweakening market discipline and the role of ambiguity about the safety net in amplifying the\neffects of financial stress and inducing public sector rescues. I have discussed this assessment at\nlength in other venues over the last four years. 2 While others have articulated very similar\n\n1\n\n\fperspectives, I should note that the views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily\nshared by colleagues within the Federal Reserve System.\nCompetitive Markets and Moral Hazard\nLet me begin with the observation that competitive markets for financial instruments―and here I\nwould include everything from credit cards and other consumer loan products to the complex\nderivatives widely used to reallocate risk―have demonstrated an immense power to extract,\naggregate and disseminate diverse individual assessments about the economic fundamentals that\nunderlie financial market transactions. This feature is generally beneficial because such\naggregation of information is how financial markets play their role in allocating resources to\ntheir most valued uses. As remarkably efficient as financial markets may be at processing\ndisparate information, however, they perform this function imperfectly and can sometimes make\nmistakes. Financial markets can “overshoot,” in the sense that prices or quantities can reach\nlevels that, with hindsight, appear to represent erroneous valuations. But identifying those\nmistakes in real time is exceedingly difficult. Since estimating the true fundamental value of a\nfinancial instrument is hard even for market mechanisms, which embody the judgment of many,\nit can be quite risky to rely instead on the judgment of a few individuals―even central bank\nstaff―who claim to know that the market is wrong.\nMy use of the word “competitive” is vitally important here, since competition is what allows\nmany investors to have a voice in the market process. Competitive markets give participants the\nincentive and opportunity to use the information they have in pursuit of individual gain. This\ndynamic is how their individual information gets amalgamated into market prices. But this same\ndynamic means that competitive markets also can be ruthless in devising and proliferating ways\nto shift private risks to the government, and thus to taxpayers. When a government guarantee\nprogram creates an opportunity to profit from taking risks that are to some extent borne by\ntaxpayers, competition will generate a rush toward that opportunity, inflating the risks born by\nthe taxpayer and depriving other sectors of resources they deserve.\nGovernment guarantees for financial institutions have been particularly problematic for financial\nstability. Federal deposit insurance was established in the 1930s in response to the wave of bank\nfailures that swept the country early in the Great Depression. But the banking problems in the\n1930s were at least partially the result of the nation’s fragmented banking system, which in turn\nwas the result of legal restrictions on bank consolidation. 3 Federal deposit insurance emerged as\na political compromise that placed taxpayers behind the risks taken by small, poorly-diversified\nbanks, instead of allowing banks to diversify those risks through consolidation. The incentive\nproblems associated with deposit insurance came to a head in the 1980s, at a substantial cost to\ntaxpayers, and led to reforms that stabilized the system, making it more sustainable.\nImplicit Government Guarantees and Shadow Banking\nAlongside formal deposit insurance, there arose beginning in the 1970s, the practice of using the\nFederal Reserve’s independent balance sheet to provide fiscal support for the uninsured liabilities\nof large financial institutions. This trend created a pattern of assistance to financially distressed\nfirms like Penn Central, Franklin National, Continental Illinois and the Bank of New York. The\n2\n\n\fpresumption of support for large financial institutions was further bolstered by repeated\nregulatory forbearance for large bank holding companies with exposures to emerging market\ndebt in the 1980s. The growth of the government sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac as implicitly protected institutions also contributed to this trend. I believe the recent crisis\nwas the culmination of a sequence of precedent-setting interventions that led the creditors of\nmany large financial firms to expect protection in the event of financial distress. This regime\nreached the point where federal guarantees―implicit and explicit―covered nearly 60 percent of\nthe liabilities of financial firms in the U.S. 4\nAs we learned from the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, government guarantees are\ndangerous without limits on risk-taking. The market discipline that is lost when insured creditors\ndo not feel themselves to be at risk must be replaced by official regulation and supervision.\nOtherwise, moral hazard will lead to excessive risk-taking. As the recent crisis made clear,\nhowever, the same incentive problems extend beyond explicitly-insured depository institutions to\ninclude the wide swaths of the financial sector that enjoyed implicit guarantees. Such guarantees\nprovided an artificial stimulus to leverage up, take on concentrated risks and engage in maturity\ntransformation―issuing liquid liabilities to fund longer-term, illiquid assets; all of which led to\noverexpansion of the so-called “shadow banking system.”\nMost of the financial market disruptions during this crisis originated in the shadow banking\nsector. Accordingly, much of the response by regulators and legislators has been in the form of\nstrengthening prudential regulation for all manner of financial firms, especially those large\nenough to be considered “systemically important” and, therefore, more likely to receive support\nin a crisis. For instance, regular forward-looking capital assessments, or “stress tests” (a set of\nthese was recently concluded), provide a robust and transparent means of ensuring the adequacy\nof firms’ capital buffers against regulator-specified adverse economic scenarios. The enhanced\nprudential standards mandated by Dodd-Frank have also usefully strengthened the regulatory\nrestraints on risk-taking, particularly in the areas of capital requirements and liquidity\nmanagement expectations.\nBut it would be a grave error, in my view, to rely too heavily on our ability to offset the effects\nof implicit safety net guarantees through more strenuous regulation. Sooner or later that approach\nis likely to fail. The more the centralized judgment of a small handful of officials, however wellinformed or well-meaning, replaces the decentralized judgments of a multitude of financial\nmarket participants, the less resilient our system will become. We should strive for a financial\nsystem that is robust to large shocks and to the unavoidable errors of judgment made by\nindividuals or single organizations.\nI should note that I have the utmost respect and admiration for the men and women of our federal\nbanking agencies who have served on the frontlines overseeing and evaluating the activities of\nlarge financial institutions. Many worked incredibly long and stressful hours for months at a time\nduring the darkening days from mid-2007 through early 2009, only to find in the aftermath that\ntheir unique skills and experience necessitated continued demands on their time for the task of\nadapting prudential supervision to the new order. To my knowledge, they have served with\ndistinction and integrity in pursuit of an arduous and complex mission.\n\n3\n\n\fRestoring Market Discipline\nInstead of placing all of our eggs in the basket of tighter regulation, we should place significantly\ngreater reliance on the powerful decentralized forces of market discipline to constrain the risktaking of large financial institutions. This requires a credible restoration of the belief that\nfinancial firms’ creditors will not benefit from public sector support in the event of financial\ndistress. To do this, however, we must face the fact that authorities often view the unassisted\nresolution of a failing or illiquid financial firm as intolerable, despite the acknowledged\nlikelihood that such assistance erodes market discipline and distorts incentives.\nAccordingly, one key strategy in the pursuit of financial stability is to make unassisted financial\nfirm failures less disruptive―and thus less aversive to policymakers. One task under such a\nstrategy would be to critically re-examine the bankruptcy code from a post-crisis perspective, to\nlook for ways to better adapt it to the business of financial firms, particularly those firms that rely\nheavily on short-term funding to finance holdings of longer-term assets. In this context, some\nscholars have highlighted the fact that many short-term financing instruments and derivatives are\nexempt from bankruptcy’s automatic stay. Such treatment is argued to have over-encouraged the\nuse of such instruments, and thereby enhanced the growth and fragility of the shadow banking\nsector. Thomas Jackson and David Skeel have proposed limiting this exemption, as well as\nadding a new chapter to the bankruptcy code specifically adapted to large financial firms. These\nreform proposals look quite promising and deserve serious consideration, in my view.\nAnother approach to making unassisted financial firm failures less intimidating would be to\nensure that financial firms prepare credible and robust plans for their orderly wind down in the\nevent of illiquidity or insolvency. Such “living wills,” as they are called, were mandated by the\nDodd-Frank Act. Regulators issued final rules for resolution plans on October 17, 2011, and\nexpect to receive draft plans from the largest financial institutions by July 1. Related, an\ninternational group of banking and financial supervisors and regulators is working to understand\nand address impediments involved in the resolution of large, complex, internationally active\nfinancial institutions.\nCredible plans for liquidating a large complicated financial firm may be hard to imagine. The\nlegal and operational complexity of such firms may reflect a variety of motives, such as\noptimizing tax liabilities, managing regulatory jurisdictions or isolating legal liabilities. There\nmay be trade-offs between the benefits to the firm employing such strategies and the financial\nstability benefits of more separable legal structures. If so, I believe that ease of separability\ndeserves the far higher priority, given what we have been through. Credible pre-existing plans\nfor the orderly wind down of a large financial institution would go a long way toward reducing\nthe odds of public sector support that thwarts market discipline. I also believe that supervisory\nwork on such plans, by highlighting the implications of various organizational structures for the\nbankruptcy process, could materially assist in efforts to understand how bankruptcy law might be\nimproved as it applies to large financial firms.\nA key characteristic of a regime relying more heavily on market discipline is a widespread belief\nthat policymakers will not rescue the creditors of failing financial firms. Bankruptcy reform and\nsound resolution plans may not be enough to allow authorities to credibly commit to allow\n4\n\n\fmarkets to work, however. Accordingly, a second strategy for financial stability is to constrain\nthe public sector’s ability to provide ad hoc support to firms facing financial stress. The DoddFrank Act included some explicit constraints on the Fed’s ability to provide extraordinary\nsupport by limiting our so-called “13(3)” powers to lend to non-depository firms in “unusual and\nexigent circumstances.” These restrictions do not go far enough, in my view, and I would favor\nfurther tightening restrictions on Federal Reserve lending by eliminating section 13(3) entirely.\nThis would be consistent with reducing the discretionary scope for inappropriate central bank\ncredit allocation and thereby enhancing the separation between monetary and fiscal policy. 5\nDodd-Frank, in Title II, also created an “Orderly Liquidation Authority,” under which the FDIC\nappears to have substantial discretion in the use of public support to aid creditors in the\nliquidation of failing financial firms. This title, which otherwise closely parallels existing\nbankruptcy law, undercuts the objective of greater financial stability by promoting uncertainty\nabout public support.\nA third financial stability strategy is to look for places where regulatory or legal impediments\nprevent private sector arrangements that would reduce instability. Money market mutual funds,\nwhich benefited from substantial official support at the height of the crisis in 2008, appear to\npresent such an opportunity. These funds have been allowed to use amortized cost accounting\nand fixed net asset values, rather than marking assets to market as do other mutual funds. In\nexchange, their asset holdings are restricted to short-term financial instruments. This allows the\nmoney funds to operate very much like bank accounts, but without the overlay of banking\nregulation and supervision. (Indeed, money market mutual funds arose in the 1970s and became\npopular as a means of bypassing regulatory limits on bank deposit interest rates.) The regulations\nalso stipulate that if the value of a fund’s assets falls below the value it has promised to\ninvestors―that is if they “break the buck”―then the fund must be liquidated. These two features\ncombine to prevent funds from temporarily suspending full payment in the event of difficulty, a\nstrategy that has allowed institutions in many settings to staunch destabilizing “runs.” For\nexample, in the era before deposit insurance partial suspensions were key to resolving banking\npanics and in the recent crisis, many hedge funds were able to avoid instability and preserve\nvalue by delaying redemptions. Current regulations essentially prevent money market funds from\nstructuring themselves in ways that reduce their fragility and vulnerability to runs. We should\neliminate regulations that keep these intermediaries from reducing their vulnerability.\nA Program for Financial Stability\nLet me conclude by briefly summarizing the program I have outlined for you. The first\nelement―strengthening the prudential supervision of large financial institutions―is well\nunderway, though much important work remains to be done. This good work will fail to prevent\nfinancial market disruptions, however, without serious efforts to significantly increase our\nreliance on the disciplining force of competition to constrain inappropriate risk-taking.\n•\n\nWe should critically re-examine bankruptcy law in light of recent events, looking for\nways to improve its effectiveness for stressed financial firms and reassure policy\nauthorities.\n\n•\n\nWe should take a very rigorous approach to the Dodd-Frank provisions requiring credible\nresolution plans for large financial firms.\n5\n\n\f•\n\nTo improve the credibility of a commitment to greater market discipline, we should\nfurther restrict the means available to use public funds to rescue private creditors.\n\n•\n\nAnd we should remove any legal or regulatory impediments―such as the existing money\nmarket fund rules―that prevent financial intermediaries from reducing their vulnerability\nto financial shocks.\n\nThis program of enhancing the use of competitive market forces may take considerable time and\neffort to achieve. In particular, since actions often speak louder than words, commitment to\nmarket discipline might not be fully credible until the first instance in which authorities allow a\nlarge financial firm to fail without public assistance. But I believe the alternative of relying\nsolely on regulation with ever-increasing reach and ever-increasing stringency will ultimately\nfail to provide adequate financial stability.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this address.\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, January 2012\nJanuary 13, 2012\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nRichmond Chapter, Risk Management Association\nRichmond, Va.\nIt’s a pleasure to be here today. I greatly appreciate you inviting me back again. I believe I have\nappeared before you six times before, and that has provided me with plenty of opportunity over\nthe years to wear out my welcome. So again, I’m grateful to be asked back yet again. My usual\ntopic at these January luncheons is the economic outlook for the new year. And, as usual, my\nremarks reflect my own independent views and do not necessarily coincide with those of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 1\nBefore I talk about the upcoming year, it will be useful to set the stage by taking a look back at\nlast year’s RMA luncheon. A year ago, I was thinking that real gross domestic product (GDP)\nwould grow by about 3 percent in 2011. Right now, it looks like we will get about 1.7 percent\nGDP growth for the year, which is a fairly large miss. Although I can take consolation in the fact\nthat many private forecasters also projected real growth of 3 percent or more, this sizeable error\nillustrates the inconvenient truth that even the best economic forecast is the midpoint of a rather\nwide range of plausible outcomes.\nSeveral unanticipated developments contributed to these forecast misses. Commodity prices had\nalready begun rising this time last year, but energy and food price increases continued in the first\nhalf of 2011 and significantly outpaced the predictions embodied in futures market prices as of\nlast January. This price surge took a sizeable bite out of real household incomes and overall\nconsumer spending slowed accordingly. Moreover, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan\ndisrupted global supply chains in a number of industries; in the U.S., the effects were most\nnoticeable in the auto market. As a result of these disturbances, real GDP grew at a paltry 0.8\npercent annual rate in the first half of 2011.\nOne would expect such transitory factors to have only limited implications for future growth.\nIndeed, auto production and sales recovered in the second half of 2011 and commodity prices\nfell, reversing much of the earlier dampening effect on household real incomes.\nThe more significant development over the course of the past year, in my view, is the growing\nsense that there are relatively persistent impediments holding back economic expansion in the\nU.S. While the pace of growth has rebounded since the first half of 2011, it appears that real\nGDP growth averaged around 2-½ percent at an annual rate over the second half. Moreover,\ngrowth has averaged only 2-½ percent since the recession bottomed out in the second quarter of\n2009.\n1\n\n\fTo put this in perspective, consider that over the last century and a half real GDP has tracked\nremarkably close to a trend line representing growth at close to 3 percent. Apart from the Great\nDepression and World War II, deviations from trend have been relatively transitory, and\nrecessions were followed by expansions at significantly greater than 3 percent. In fact, it was\ncommonplace to see growth rates of 5 or 6 percent coming out of a sharp recession. In this\nrecession, real GDP contracted by over 5 percent, and we have not closed the gap to that trend\nline. Instead of catching up, we appear to be tracking a new lower trend line.\nWhat is hampering our recovery? The still-overbuilt housing market tops the list. Residential\nconstruction almost invariably expands rapidly at the beginning of a recovery, with growth rates\nof 30 percent or more not uncommon. This time, home building has basically been flat. The\nnumber of single-family housing starts in 2011 will be basically the same as in 2009.\nSeveral understandable forces are holding the housing market back. First, in many areas of the\ncountry, there are still more homes than households want to own. Looking back on the housing\nboom with the benefit of hindsight, it’s clear that mortgage underwriting standards were too lax.\nThis was largely the result, I believe, of the distorted incentives and moral hazard associated with\nfinancial entities viewed as too big to fail. As a result, many regions are simply oversupplied\nwith housing.\nMortgage underwriting standards have become significantly more conservative since the housing\nbust, and that is a second factor restraining housing demand. Some of the tightening in credit\nstandards reflects new regulatory constraints, particularly those governing Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac, who are now wards of the state and being managed to protect taxpayers against\nfurther losses. But some of the tightening in credit standards also reflects the natural ebb and\nflow of credit terms over the business cycle. Credit terms tighten in a downturn because any\ngiven borrower is riskier then, all else constant. Moreover, the housing boom and bust taught us\nsignificant lessons about the risks associated with innovative mortgage lending practices and the\nodds of a broad, sustained decline in home prices. Certainly, this is not the first credit market that\nhas experienced a cycle of overshooting and retrenchment; such dynamics are natural and to be\nexpected in markets in which significant learning is taking place over time. Borrowers and\nlenders alike now have a much greater appreciation for the economic risks associated with\nhighly-leveraged home ownership. In that light, a highly cautious attitude toward mortgage debt\nmakes abundant sense.\nGiven sizeable oversupply and tighter credit standards, the housing market appears to be in for a\nlengthy adjustment process. Substantial real income gains will be required before demand\ncatches up to the current housing stock. Moreover, there is a “mismatch” problem to solve, in\nthat some households have homes and mortgages for which they are not well matched.\nTransitioning people into homes they want and can afford given their current income is a timeconsuming process. Unfortunately, for some households, the transition process involves\ndelinquency and foreclosure. In such cases, the adjustment has been slowed by the inability of\nthe servicing industry to handle effectively the mountain of unanticipated foreclosure cases, as\nwell as by judicial congestion and regulatory intervention.\n\n2\n\n\fMuch progress has been made in the process of adjusting to the new environment, but substantial\nadjustment lies ahead. Fortunately, home prices appear to have stabilized in 2011, at least for\nnon-distressed properties. Part of the adjustment process in the housing market involves a broad\nmovement away from owner-occupied homes and toward rental housing. Indeed, vacancy rates\nfor rental properties have declined of late, and rental rates are firming as a result. And what gains\nwe’ve seen in residential construction have been in the multi-unit rental segment. This appears to\nbe a relatively persistent development, representing a natural response to the aftermath of the\nhousing boom. I expect single-family home building to remain soft for some time, however.\nThe fall in housing prices from 2006 to 2009 erased a substantial portion of the home equity that\nhouseholds had accumulated in the housing boom. Another facet of the adjustment process has\nbeen the propensity of consumers to pay down debt and build up savings to restore their balance\nsheets to a more desirable relationship with their current and prospective income. As a\nconsequence, consumer spending has been expanding at a more moderate pace than in past\nrecoveries.\nConsumer spending has also been dampened by labor market conditions, which have improved\nat a disappointingly slow pace since bottoming out in early 2010. Over that period, employment\ngrowth has averaged 120,000 jobs per month; at that rate, it would take over four years to\nrecover the jobs lost in the recession and its immediate aftermath. Last month’s payroll\nemployment gain of 200,000 was a heartening sign of a potential firming trend.\nEvidence suggests that one impediment to more rapid employment gains is the magnitude of the\nmismatch between the skills of the unemployed and the skills most in demand by firms with\nexpanding output. Recessions and recoveries always involve shifting resources from some\neconomic sectors to others in response to new technologies and new patterns of demand. Many\nof the workers that leave declining industries in the downturn eventually find work in newly\nexpanding industries in the recovery. That search process can take some time and might require\nsome additional training, since the skills of those released from contracting sectors, such as\nconstruction, may not line up with the skills required in expanding sectors, such as health care.\nThe frictions associated with this process of sectoral and occupational reallocation appear to be\nempirically significant. One recent estimate indicates that labor market mismatch might account\nfor between 0.8 and 1.4 percentage points of the increase in unemployment in this recession. 2\nAnother impediment to growth cited by a wide range of observers is the array of changes in tax\nand regulatory policy, both actual and anticipated. We continue to hear widespread and persistent\nanecdotal reports from our Fifth Federal Reserve District contacts about how uncertainty about\nregulatory policy changes is discouraging firms from making new hiring or investment\ncommitments. It seems plausible to me that such effects could be having a noticeable impact on\nmeasured growth rates.\nApart from regulatory changes, the dire federal budget outlook also imposes significant\nuncertainties on consumers and businesses. The path for federal debt under current law is simply\nnot feasible. One way or another, significant adjustments will occur, either through higher\nmarginal tax rates, cuts in programs’ benefits or reductions in government payrolls and supplier\n\n3\n\n\fcontracts. Evidence suggests that uncertainty about the nature of those adjustments is impeding\nsome firms’ willingness to commit to new hiring or investments.\nI have been talking about the impediments that have been weighing on growth in the U.S., but\none category of economic activity has been living up to our usual expectations of robust growth\nfollowing a recession. Business investment in equipment and software — our broadest measure\nof business capital formation apart from structures — grew at a solid 7.6 percent annual rate in\nthe first three quarters of 2011. Even with overall economic activity growing less rapidly than in\nthe typical recovery, firms continue to identify profitable opportunities to deploy technology to\nreduce costs or improve business processes. This suggests that the underlying forces of\ninnovation and creativity — forces that are evident in over 150 years of economic growth — are\nstill at work.\nAnother contribution to growth has come from the trade sector. Exports have increased 23\npercent since the end of the recession, and prospects there remain bright. A large fraction of the\nworld’s population resides in countries that have relatively low household incomes but are\ngrowing rapidly. In these emerging economies, firms are deploying capital to equip a growing\nlabor force, creating a strong demand for American investment goods. And as these more\nproductive workers move into the middle class they will want to purchase a range of goods from\nU.S. firms, from sodas, to movies, to video games. So I expect export growth to continue to add\nto overall economic activity this year.\nOn balance, until now, the impediments to recovery — including the housing stock overhang,\nconsumer deleveraging, skills deficits and uncertainty regarding regulatory and tax policy —\nhave had the upper hand. They represent difficult economic challenges that are not likely to cure\nthemselves quickly over time. My takeaway from 2011 is the lesson that the impediments to\nmore rapid U.S. growth are likely to be deeper and more persistent than we thought a year ago.\nAs a consequence, I am expecting only a modest improvement for 2012, with GDP expanding at\na pace between 2 and 2-½ percent. This is a forecast of growth at a moderate pace ― not as rapid\nas past expansions, but positive growth nonetheless.\nI see three main risks to this outlook. First, while my projection builds in a substantial slowdown\nin European economies in the first half of this year, the risk exists that a more pronounced\nrecession in Europe could significantly dampen U.S. growth. Second, I believe there is a chance\nthat U.S. consumers could regain confidence at a more rapid pace and propel a stronger pickup in\noverall growth. And third, while business investment spending is expected to moderate this year,\nwe could miss that forecast.\nA key part of any forecast is inflation. In 2011, we were reminded that inflation can rise despite\nelevated unemployment. In 2010, the inflation rate was 1.4 percent.3 In the first 11 months of\n2011, inflation has averaged 2.5 percent at an annual rate. Obviously the run-up in energy and\nfood prices earlier this year played a big role in this increase. But the pickup in inflation last year\nwas broad based. Core inflation ― which strips out food and energy prices ― was 0.9 percent in\n2010, but averaged 1.7 percent in 2011 through November. This higher inflation rate in 2011,\ndespite unemployment averaging 9 percent, undercuts the hoary notion that “slack” in the labor\n\n4\n\n\fmarket can be counted on to keep inflation contained. This lesson is of course not new; we\nlearned this all too well during the 1970s.\nDespite last year’s run-up, I believe the inflation outlook is reasonably good right now. Recent\nprice trends have been quite favorable, and indeed, headline inflation has been quite low in\nrecent months. The most likely outcome this year, in my view, is for overall inflation to average\nclose to 2 percent. A rate noticeably below 2 percent is possible, particularly if global growth\nshould soften enough to further ease pressures on commodity prices. But I still view the risks to\ninflation as tilted to the upside. A comparison of 2011 with the experience of 2004 through 2007,\nfor example, suggests that an upswing in inflation at this stage of the business cycle is typically\nlong-lasting.\nNo review of the economic outlook would be complete without some comment on policy\noutlook. Disappointingly slow growth often prompts calls for more central bank stimulus. But\nmonetary policy is given credit for entirely too much influence on real economic activity.\nMonetary policy is about inflation ― that is, the value of money. The effects of changes in\nmonetary policy on real output and employment are largely the transitory byproducts of frictions\nthat delay the timely adjustment of prices to changes in monetary conditions. Over time, these\neffects dissipate, and growth is governed almost entirely by the evolution of a society’s\ntechnology, skills, resources and trading opportunities. The macroeconomic experience of 2011\nprovides vivid illustration; despite large-scale efforts to provide more monetary stimulus, growth\ndisappointed and inflation moved upward.\nSo to summarize, I expect growth to continue in the year ahead, though at a moderate pace, and I\nexpect inflation to remain in the neighborhood of 2 percent. I wish you all a happy New Year,\nand I hope that this year brings with it more modest expectations for monetary policy.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for their assistance in preparing this speech.\nAyşegül Şahin, Joseph Song, Giorgio Topa and Giovanni L.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, December 2011\nDecember 19, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCharlotte Chamber of Commerce Economic Outlook Conference\nCharlotte, N.C.\nIt’s a pleasure to return to Charlotte today for this annual gathering. I generally look forward to these\noccasions with anticipation because of the chance they give me to reconnect with friends in the Charlotte\nregion. This year, however, that feeling of anticipation has been tinged with a bit of apprehension. Our\nmaster of ceremonies, Henry Faison, likes to remind me about my previous year’s forecast for economic\ngrowth, particularly how it compares with what actually happened. Last year, I projected that real gross\ndomestic product, or GDP, growth through the fourth quarter of 2011 would average above 3 percent.\nRight now, it looks like we’ll get something like 1-¾ percent for the year ― a fairly sizable miss. So I\nreturn to Charlotte this year suitably chastened and mindful of the humility one should always bring to\nforecasting ― and to policymaking, for that matter.\nThis is a popular time of year to conduct performance appraisals, in which individuals or organizations\nlook back and evaluate past accomplishments. In the modern approach to performance appraisals, the\nfocus is less on criticizing shortcomings and more on identifying “lessons learned” that might be useful\ngoing forward. In that spirit, my remarks this afternoon will focus on the lessons one ought to take away\nfrom the past year of U.S. macroeconomic performance. As always, my remarks reflect my own\nindependent views and do not necessarily coincide with those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC). 1\nThe obvious first candidate for a lesson learned looking back on 2011 is that forecasting is difficult.\nIndeed, I was in good company in landing so wide of the mark on real GDP growth. Numerous private\nforecasters, along with many of my FOMC colleagues, were forecasting growth over 3 percent.\nSeveral unanticipated developments contributed to these forecast misses. Commodity prices had already\nbegun rising when we met here last year, but energy and food price increases in the first part of this year\nsignificantly outpaced the predictions embodied in futures market prices. That acceleration took a\nsignificant bite out of household real income growth, and consumers held back spending as a result. The\nnatural disaster in Japan, which caused so much suffering, also had the effect of disrupting global supply\nchains and forcing production cutbacks worldwide. These all took their toll on first-half growth in the\nU.S., which came in at a paltry 0.8 percent.\nOne would expect such transitory factors to have only limited implications for future growth. Indeed, auto\nproduction has recovered, and commodity prices have peaked and are trending downward, reversing the\nearlier dampening effect on household real income growth.\nThe more significant lessons learned over the course of this past year, in my view, concern the importance\nof relatively persistent impediments to economic expansion in the U.S. While the pace of growth has\n\n1\n\n\frebounded since the first half of the year, most analysts are still only expecting real GDP growth to\naverage a bit above 2-½ percent at an annual rate over the second half. Moreover, growth has averaged\nonly 2-½ percent over the 2-½ years since the recession bottomed out in the second quarter of 2009. As I\nnoted last year, this post-recession expansion is lagging significantly behind the pace of the expansions\nthat followed other severe U.S. recessions.\nThe still-overbuilt housing market tops the list of persistent factors that continue to impede growth.\nResidential construction typically expands robustly in a recovery, but has been basically flat this time.\nThe soft state of demand for new homes, despite record-low mortgage rates, suggests that home building\nis likely to remain depressed for some time to come. What gains we’ve seen in residential construction\nhave been in multi-unit rental properties, reflecting the continuing shift, at the margin, away from home\nownership. This could represent a beneficial consequence of a retreat ― at least for the time being ―\nfrom federal policies that have long subsidized housing debt.\nU.S. households also have been adjusting their financial positions to adapt to their post-recession\ncircumstances. Diminished income prospects and tighter credit terms have given consumers ample reason\nto focus on paying down debt and building up savings. As a result, consumer spending is expanding at a\nmore moderate pace than in past recoveries.\nLabor market conditions, which are so critical in shaping consumer spending trends, improved at a\ndisappointingly slow pace this year. Evidence suggests that one impediment to more rapid employment\ngains is the magnitude of the skills mismatch between the unemployed and the needs of the growing\nsegments of the economy. Recessions and recoveries all involve shifting resources from some economic\nsectors to others because the composition of the expansion seldom perfectly mirrors that of the\ncontraction. Many of the workers that exit declining industries in the downturn eventually find work in\nnewly expanding industries in the recovery. That search process can take some time and might require\nsome additional training, since the skills of those released from contracting sectors may not line up with\nthe skills required in expanding sectors. The frictions associated with this process of sectoral and\noccupational reallocation appear to be empirically significant, accounting in one recent estimate for about\none percentage point of the increase in unemployment in this recession. 2\nAnother impediment to growth cited by a wide range of observers is the array of changes in tax and\nregulatory policy, both actual and anticipated. The list of significant recent and prospective policy\nchanges includes the enactment of far-reaching health care and financial reform bills in the last 2-½ years,\nas well as significant shifts in environmental and labor regulations over that period. While it is inherently\ndifficult to model and estimate such effects with any confidence, we continue to receive widespread and\npersistent anecdotal reports from our Fifth Federal Reserve District contacts about how uncertainty about\nregulatory policy changes is discouraging firms from making new hiring or investment commitments. It\nseems plausible to me that such effects could be having a noticeable effect on measured growth rates.\nApart from regulatory changes, the murky federal budget outlook also imposes significant uncertainties\non consumers and businesses. Realistic projections under current law show federal debt outpacing our\nnational income for decades to come, with no bound on the ratio of debt to GDP. This simply is not\nfeasible, and the experience of southern Europe demonstrates that the real world ultimately will constrain\nour debt issuance if our own government fails to do so. Any sustainable configuration of fiscal policy\nimplies adjustments that are bound to affect a broad range of citizens in economically relevant ways,\neither through higher marginal tax rates, cuts in programs’ benefits or reductions in government payrolls\nand supplier contracts. Uncertainty about the nature of the adjustments appears to be impeding some\nfirms’ willingness to commit to new hiring or investments. For example, the cloudy outlook for federal\nspending is having a noticeable effect on economic activity in the greater Washington area.\n\n2\n\n\fI should note that one component of economic activity has been living up to our usual expectations of\nrobust growth following a recession. Business investment in equipment and software ― our broadest\nmeasure of business capital formation apart from structures — grew at an average annual rate of about 10\npercent in the first three quarters. Even with demand growing less rapidly than in the typical recovery,\nfirms continue to identify profitable opportunities to deploy technology to reduce costs or improve\nbusiness processes. The fact that firms are finding such opportunities suggests that the underlying forces\nof innovation and creativity — forces responsible for over 150 years of economic growth ― are still at\nwork.\nThe impediments to growth though ― the housing stock overhang, consumer deleveraging, skills deficits\nand uncertainty regarding regulatory and tax policy ― have had the upper hand this year. They represent\ndifficult economic challenges that are not likely to cure themselves quickly over time. My takeaway from\n2011 is the lesson that the impediments to more rapid U.S. growth are likely to be deeper and more\npersistent than we thought a year ago.\nA related macroeconomic lesson learned by many this past year ― perhaps I should say relearned ― is\nthat inflation can accelerate despite elevated levels of unemployment. As of last December, the (12month) inflation rate was 1.4 percent. 3 To date this year, inflation has averaged a 2.8 percent annual rate.\nObviously the run-up in energy and food prices earlier this year played a big role in this year-over-year\nacceleration. But the pickup in inflation this year has been broad based. Core inflation ― which strips out\nfood and energy prices ― was 0.9 percent last December, but has averaged 1.9 percent so far this year.\nThe doubling of inflation this year, despite unemployment averaging 9 percent, undercuts the hoary\nnotion that “slack” in the labor market can be counted on to keep inflation contained. As I noted a\nmoment ago, however, this lesson is not new; we learned this all too well during the disastrous inflation\nof the 1970s.\nDespite this year’s run-up, I believe the inflation outlook is reasonably good right now. Recent price\ntrends have been quite favorable, and indeed, headline inflation has been quite low in recent months.\nHaving said that, my sense is that the current slowdown is likely to prove as transitory, as did the\nacceleration we saw earlier in the year. The most likely outcome this year, in my view, is for overall\ninflation to average close to 2 percent. Deceleration to a rate noticeably below 2 percent is a risk to that\nprojection, particularly if global growth should soften enough to further ease pressures on commodity\nprices. But I still view the risks to inflation as tilted to the upside. A comparison of 2011 with the\nexperience of 2004 through 2007, for example, suggests that an upswing in inflation at this stage of the\nbusiness cycle is typically long-lasting. As for real growth, taking on board the lessons learned in 2011, I\nam expecting real GDP to expand next year at a pace between 2 and 2-½.\nThat projection is predicated on continued expansion in payroll employment and consumers gradually\nacquiring more confidence in their labor market prospects. Business investment in equipment and\nsoftware, which, as I’ve noted, has been a key driver in the recovery, should continue to expand, though\nperhaps at a less torrid pace. Growth in export demand is likely to slow somewhat, given significantly\nweakening growth in the euro area. Home construction is likely to remain relatively dormant, and like\ngovernment spending, is unlikely to make much noticeable contribution to growth.\nThis is a forecast of growth at a moderate pace ― not as rapid as some past expansions, but positive\ngrowth nonetheless. I see the major risks to such an outlook as threefold. The accretion of consumer\nconfidence in their economic prospects could proceed either more or less rapidly than projected. The\ndependence of consumer expectations on subjective assessments makes them difficult to forecast, but I\nsee risks there on both sides. Second, the pace at which businesses have invested in equipment and\nsoftware has surprised on the upside throughout the recovery. While some moderation in the rate at which\nthat investment is expanding seems likely, we could easily miss on that forecast.\n\n3\n\n\fAnd third, the trajectory of economic activity in Europe is likely to hold significant implications for U.S.\ngrowth in the coming year. Euro area governments are grappling with the financial market volatility that\ninevitably follows from ambiguous commitments to protect creditors using taxpayer funds. In this case,\nthe ambiguity surrounds protection that might be forthcoming, both for sovereign debt holders and the\ncreditors of large European banks. The rapid fiscal and balance sheet adjustments, and the accompanying\nuncertainty regarding prospective tax policy, appear to be dampening euro zone growth, and that is likely\nto cut into U.S. export demand in the year ahead. My projection for U.S. GDP growth of between 2 and 2½ percent, however, already builds in a substantial slowdown in Europe.\nHaving shared with you my outlook for 2012 and having discussed two lessons learned in 2011 ―\nnamely, that real impediments to growth are more persistent than we thought and that inflation can rise\neven with high unemployment ― I would like to conclude by sharing with you one final lesson I think the\npast year provides. It’s that monetary policy is often credited with entirely too much influence on real\ngrowth. Monetary policy is about inflation ― that is, the value of money. The effects of changes in\nmonetary policy on real output and employment are largely the transitory by-products of frictions that\ndelay the timely adjustment of prices to changes in monetary conditions. Over time, these effects\ndissipate, and growth is governed almost entirely by the evolution of a society’s technology, skills,\nresources and trading opportunities. Yes, the stance of monetary policy varies substantially with real\neconomic conditions. But that is essentially because the monetary policy stance that is required to keep\ninflation stable fluctuates with real economic conditions.\nThe macroeconomic experience of 2011 provides vivid illustration. Despite large-scale efforts to provide\nmore monetary stimulus, growth has disappointed and inflation has ratcheted upward. In some sense, this\nthird lesson is merely the corollary of the first two, since it reflects the fact that growth is governed\npredominantly by nonmonetary phenomena, which implies that monetary stimulus can at times move\ninflation more than employment.\nThis lesson leads me back to the apprehension I mentioned at the outset of my remarks ― my discomfort\nwith last year’s GDP forecast miss. Now I know that my friend Henry Faison understands all too well the\nimportance of the Fed maintaining low and stable inflation. Henry served as chairman of the Richmond\nFed’s Board of Directors in the 1990s and strongly supported the struggle for price stability. That makes\nit a bit puzzling to me that he would hold me accountable for my growth forecast each year, rather than\nmy inflation forecast. After all, a classic precept in modern performance management is that an\norganization’s objectives should be within their ability to control. A central bank’s ability to elevate its\neconomy’s growth rate over a sustained period, while preserving price stability, is quite limited. I would\nsuggest accordingly, Henry, that in the future you hold me accountable for inflation outcomes, not growth\noutcomes.\nThank you all for your attention, and I look forward to returning to discuss inflation in 2012.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg for his assistance in preparing this speech.\nAyşegül Şahin, Joseph Song, Giorgio Topa and Giovanni L.

            "content": "Understanding the Intervenist Impulse of the Modern Central Bank\nNovember 16, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nCato Institute 29th Annual Monetary Conference\nWashington, D.C.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 was a watershed event for the Federal Reserve and other\ncentral banks. The extraordinary actions they took have been described, alternatively, as a natural\nextension of monetary policy to extreme circumstances, or as a problematic exercise in credit\nallocation. I have expressed my view elsewhere that much of the Fed’s response to the crisis falls\nin the latter category rather than the former.1 Rather than reargue that case, I want to take this\nopportunity to reflect on some of the institutional reasons behind the prevailing propensity of\nmany modern central banks to intervene in credit markets. As always, these remarks are my own\nand the views expressed are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.2\nThere is widespread agreement among economists that a vigorous monetary policy response can\nbe necessary at times to prevent a contraction from becoming a deflationary spiral. Financial\nmarket turmoil often sparks a flight to monetary assets. In the 19th and 20th centuries, this often\ntook the form of shifts out of deposits and into notes and specie. Under a fractional reserve\nbanking system, this necessitates a deflationary contraction in the overall money supply unless\noffset through clearinghouse or central bank expansion of the note supply. In modern financial\npanics, banks often seek to hoard reserve balances, which again would be contractionary absent\nan accommodating increase in the central bank reserve supply. In both cases, the need is for an\nincrease in outstanding central bank monetary liabilities.\nThe Fed’s response during the financial crisis was not purely monetary, however. In the first\nphase of the crisis — from the fall of 2007 through the summer of 2008 — its credit actions were\nsterilized; lending through the Term Auction Facility and in support of the merger of Bear\nStearns and JPMorgan Chase was offset by sales of U.S. Treasury securities from the Fed’s\nportfolio. (Note that such sterilized actions are equivalent to issuing new U.S. Treasury debt to\nthe public and using the proceeds to fund the lending.) It wasn’t until September 2008 that the\nsupply of excess reserves began to increase significantly. This expansion was accomplished\nthrough the acquisition of an expanding set of private assets — loans to banks and other financial\ninstitutions and later mortgage-backed securities and debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac. While some observers describe this phase of the Fed’s response as a standard, monetary\nexpansion in the face of a deflationary threat, the Fed’s own characterization often emphasized\ninstead the intent to provide direct assistance to dysfunctional segments of the credit markets.\nClearly, an equivalent expansion of reserve supply could have been achieved via purchases of\nU.S. Treasury securities — that is, without credit allocation.\n\n1\n\n\fLike the Fed, the European Central Bank and other central banks have pursued credit allocation\nin response to the crisis.\nThe impulse to reallocate credit certainly reflects an earnest desire to fix perceived credit market\nproblems that seem within the central bank’s power to fix. My sense is that Federal Reserve\ncredit policy was motivated by a sincere belief that central banks have a civic duty to alleviate\nsignificant ex post inefficiencies in credit markets. But credit allocation can redirect resources\nfrom taxpayers to financial market investors and, over time, can expand moral hazard and distort\nthe allocation of capital. This implies a difficult and contentious cost-benefit calculation. But no\nmatter how the net benefits are assessed, central bank intervention in credit markets will have\ndistributional consequences.\nCentral bank credit allocation is therefore bound to be controversial. Indeed, such actions taken\nby the Fed over the last few years have generated a level of invective that has not been seen in a\nvery long time. Critics have sought to exploit the resentment of credit market rescues for partisan\npolitical advantage. While it is easy to deplore politically motivated attempts to influence Fed\npolicy, we need to recognize the extent to which some measure of antagonism is an\nunderstandable consequence of the Fed’s own credit policy initiatives.\nThe inevitable controversy surrounding central bank intervention in credit markets is one reason\nmany observers have long advocated keeping central banks out of credit allocation.3 Central\nbank lending undermines the integrity of the fiscal appropriations process, and while U.S. fiscal\npolicymaking may not inspire much admiration these days, it is subject to the checks and\nbalances provided for by the Constitution. Contentious disputes about which credit market\nsegments receive support, and which do not, can entangle the central bank in political conflicts\nthat threaten the independence of monetary policymaking.\nThe independence that the modern central bank has to control the monetary policy interest rate\nemerged in stages following the end of World War II. The Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951 freed\nthe Fed from the wartime obligation to depress the Treasury’s borrowing costs. The collapse of\nthe gold standard in the early 1970s and the attendant bouts of inflation led the Fed in 1979 to\nassert responsibility for low inflation as a long-term objective of monetary policy.4 The\nindependent commitment of central banks to low inflation provides a nominal anchor to\nsubstitute for the anchor formerly provided by the gold standard.\nThe substantial measure of independence central banks were given was a key element in their\nrelative success at sustaining low inflation over the last few decades. In fact, many other\ncountries have adopted frameworks that hold their central banks accountable for a price stability\ngoal, while allowing them to set interest rate policy independently in pursuit of their goals. This\ninstrument independence has been critical to insulating monetary policymaking from electionrelated political pressures that can detract from longer-term objectives.\nThe cornerstone of central bank independence is the ability to control the amount of monetary\nliabilities it supplies to the public. But as a by-product, many central banks retain the ability to\nindependently control the composition of their assets as well. For most modern central banks,\nstandard policy in normal times is to restrict asset holdings to their own country’s government\n2\n\n\fdebt. Some hold gold as well, a vestige of the gold standard. In addition, many make short-term\nloans to banks, either to meet temporary liquidity needs or as part of clearing and settlement\noperations; both are vestiges of the origin of central banks as nationalized clearinghouses.\nThe ability of a central bank to intervene in credit markets using the asset side of its balance\nsheet creates an inevitable tension. The desire of the executive and legislative branches to\nprovide governmental assistance to particular credit market participants can rise dramatically in\ntimes of financial market stress. At such times, the power of a central bank to do fiscal policy\nessentially outside the safeguards of the constitutional process for appropriations makes it an\ninviting target for other government officials. Central bank lending is often the path of least\nresistance in a financial crisis. The resulting political entanglements, as we have seen, create\nrisks for the independence of monetary policy.\nThis tension is a classic time consistency problem. Central bank rescues serve the short-term\ngoal of protecting investors from the pain of unanticipated credit market losses, but dilute market\ndiscipline and distort future risk-taking incentives. Over time, small “one-off” interventions set\nprecedents that encourage greater risk taking and increase the odds of future distress.\nPolicymakers then feel boxed in and obligated to intervene in ever larger ways, perpetuating a\nvicious cycle of government safety net expansion.\nThe conundrum facing central banks, then, is that the balance sheet independence that proved\ncrucial in the fight to tame inflation is itself a handicap in the pursuit of financial market\nstability. The latitude the typical central bank has to intervene in credit markets weakens its\nability to discourage expectations of future rescues and thereby enhance market discipline.\nSolving this conundrum and containing the impulse to intervene requires one of two approaches.\nA central bank could seek to build and maintain a reputation for not intervening, in much the\nway the Fed and other central banks established credibility for a commitment to low inflation in\nthe 1980s. Alternatively, explicit legislative measures could constrain central bank lending. The\nDodd Frank Act took steps in this direction by banning loans to individual nonbank entities. But\nReserve banks retain the power to lend to individual depository institutions and to intervene in\nparticular credit market segments in “unusual and exigent circumstances” through credit\nprograms with “broad-based eligibility.”5 In addition, the Fed can channel credit by purchasing\nthe obligations of government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nConstraining central bank lending powers would appear to conflict with the popular perception\nthat serving as a “lender of last resort” is intrinsic to central banking. But even here, I think our\nhistorical doctrines and practices should not escape reconsideration. The notion of the central\nbank as a lender of last resort derives from an era of commodity money standard, when central\nbank lending in a crisis was the way to expand currency supply to meet a sudden increase in\ndemand. Indeed, the preamble to the Federal Reserve Act says its purpose is “to furnish an\nelastic currency,” not to furnish elastic credit. The Fed could easily manage the supply of\nmonetary assets through purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury securities only.6 While it might\nsound extreme, I believe that a regime in which the Federal Reserve is restricted to hold only\nU.S. Treasury securities purchased on the open market is worthy of consideration.7\n\n3\n\n\fIt might seem easy to criticize such a regime by reference to what it would have prevented the\nFed from doing in the recent crisis. But that’s the wrong frame of reference, I believe — it’s an\nex post, rather than an ex ante, perspective. Such a regime, if credible, would over time force\nchanges in market practices that would alter the likelihood and magnitude of crises and the\nbehavior of private market arrangements during a crisis. It would strengthen market discipline\nand incent institutions to operate with more capital and less short-term debt funding — changes\nwe are now trying to achieve through regulatory means. The relative costs and benefits of such a\nregime may be difficult to map out conclusively. But I believe this tradeoff is well worth\nstudying.\nTen years ago, my former colleagues Al Broaddus and Marvin Goodfriend argued that the design\nof central bank asset policy is “part of the unfinished business of building a modern, independent\nFederal Reserve.”8 The 1951 Treasury-Fed Accord provided for independent Federal Reserve\ncontrol of its liabilities, a necessary ingredient in monetary policy independence. But the\naccompanying power to use the Fed’s asset portfolio to intervene in credit markets threatens to\ndiminish that independence. Sorting out the conundrum of central bank asset policy should be\nhigh on the agenda for all those interested in improving the practice of central banking.\n1\n\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, October 2011\nOct. 17, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nSalisbury-Wicomico Economic Development Annual Meeting\nSalisbury, Maryland\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you tonight. I will be discussing the economy — both current\neconomic conditions and what the future might hold. Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that these\nremarks are my own and the views expressed are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).1\nMy views about the economy are shaped by the ongoing analysis of national and regional data by staff in\nthe Federal Reserve System, particularly at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. But they are also\ninfluenced importantly by the wealth of information that we glean from regular contacts with businesses\nand consumers around our district. There is no good substitute, in my mind, for talking with economic\ndecision makers about their particular situation and hearing their concerns for the future. Indeed, what\nbrings my Richmond Fed colleagues and me to this region is a desire to learn more about some of the key\ndrivers of the Eastern Shore economy. Before coming to tonight’s dinner, a group of us visited various\nbusinesses involved in the poultry and seafood industries. Tomorrow, we’ll learn about state-of-the-art\ntechnology that is transforming the space and defense industries. Making sense of these developments and\nincoming economic data would be much more difficult without the perspective derived from our contacts\naround the Fifth District. The Fed’s ability to gather such information is greatly enhanced by the\ndecentralized, federated structure of the System, a subject to which I will return later in my remarks.\n\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nCurrent economic conditions are to a large extent still being shaped by the process of recovering from the\nrecession of 2008 and 2009. This was the worst contraction in economic activity since the 1930s. Real\nGDP, our best estimate of total output in the economy, fell by more than 5 percent from the end of 2007\nto the second quarter of 2009, but that figure may understate the damage. New housing starts fell by\nnearly 80 percent from peak to trough.2 We lost 8.5 million jobs, causing the unemployment rate to more\nthan double by the time it topped out at over 10 percent.3 And household wealth fell by over $16 trillion\nin less than two years.4 It’s no exaggeration to call it the Great Recession.\nAs we emerged from the recession, many economists were cautiously optimistic. As a nation we have\nproven to be extraordinarily resilient at times, and we typically exit from a recession growing at a fairly\nrapid clip. That hasn’t happened this time. Output increased by only 3 percent last year, and, in the first\nhalf of this year, growth slowed to an anemic 0.8 percent annual rate, well below the longer-run growth\ntrend that is commonly estimated to be between 2-½ and 3 percent. Unemployment has remained\nstubbornly high, at 9.1 percent according to the latest reading, because job growth has been sluggish. So\nhere we are, more than two years after the recession officially ended, having a hard time making up the\nground lost during the Great Recession.\nWhat accounts for this mediocre performance? Most obviously, housing construction is depressed. In\nearlier recessions housing often fell sharply but rebounded quickly and made a significant contribution to\n\n\freal growth during the recovery. This time, however, the housing boom that preceded the recession left us\nwith a large oversupply of vacant homes, and these continue to weigh on many local markets, dampening\nnew construction. Since the end of the recession, housing starts have averaged less than half the rate of\nthe mid-1990s.\nWhile housing has played a significant role, consumer spending has accounted for even more of the\nweakness of this recovery. Household spending normally contributes strongly to a recovery; while\nconsumers cut spending during a recession, when the recession comes to an end they anticipate brighter\ntimes ahead and restore spending even if incomes are temporarily depressed. In this recovery, though, real\nconsumer spending has grown at a pace that is fairly modest and not strong enough to generate the rapid\noverall growth we have seen in other recoveries.\nThe cautious pace of consumer spending is understandable, though. Growth in employment and real\nincome has been sluggish, and the large decline in household net worth during the recession gave\nconsumers ample reason to focus on paying down debt and building up savings.\nWhile housing and consumer spending account for a good part of the sluggishness of this recovery, other\nsectors have done much better. Business investment in equipment and software has increased\nsubstantially since the end of the recession. Many firms apparently continue to find cost-effective ways to\nimprove processes, increase quality and enhance efficiency through new capital outlays, despite the\nmodest pace of overall demand growth. Exports of goods and services have also contributed positively to\nthe recovery. Many emerging economies are experiencing sustained periods of rapid growth as their\neconomies modernize and need durable goods embodying state-of-the-art technology. This is where the\nU.S. has a strong comparative advantage. So, for a balanced picture of the economy, it’s important to\nkeep these bright spots in view.\nMany analysts began this year expecting growth to pick up, even after accounting for consumer caution\nand housing oversupply. Pent-up demand would overcome residual caution for many households, and\nhousing construction would return to more normal levels. Several temporary factors intervened, however.\nThe earthquake and tsunami in Japan had severe consequences for their economy and disrupted supply\nchains across many global industries. And crude oil prices ramped up starting late last year, as the outlook\nfor global demand picked up. Further increases were driven by conflicts in oil-producing states in the\nMiddle East and North Africa. Retail gasoline prices here in the U.S. rapidly followed suit, further\ndampening consumer spending.\nAs this year has unfolded and the effects of these temporary factors have ebbed, it has become apparent\nthat there are more persistent factors impeding growth in this recovery. While a number of candidate\nexplanations are plausible, pinning down their quantitative contributions is quite challenging. A broad\nrange of observers have pointed out that changes in tax and regulatory policy, both actual and anticipated,\nare capable of dampening output and consumption growth and limiting hiring and investment. The list of\nsignificant recent and prospective policy changes should be familiar and includes the enactment of farreaching health care and financial reform bills in the last two years, as well as significant shifts in\nenvironmental and labor regulations. We have heard many anecdotal reports in our district of uncertainty\nabout the direct impact of such changes discouraging firms from making new hiring or investment\ncommitments.\nThe federal budget outlook is another source of uncertainty that plausibly could be dampening growth\nnow. The federal deficit is currently almost 10 percent of GDP, and realistic projections under current\npolicies show federal debt outpacing our national income for decades to come, with no bound on debt-toGDP ratios. This simply is not feasible, and the experience of southern Europe demonstrates that the real\nworld ultimately will place caps on our debt if our own government fails to do so. The list of those who\n\n2\n\n\fwould be affected by potential repairs to our broken fiscal accounts covers virtually the entire economy:\nfrom taxpayers vulnerable to higher marginal tax rates, to program beneficiaries exposed to cuts, to\ngovernment employees and suppliers, to government agencies. In fact, the cloudy outlook for federal\nspending is having a noticeable effect on economic activity in the greater Washington area. I should note\nthat our business contacts complain less about the effects of potential policy changes than they do about\nthe lack of clarity about the rules of the game.\nAnother factor that appears to be impeding recovery is the magnitude of the mismatch between the\nunemployed and the needs of a growing economy. All recessions and recoveries involve shifting\nresources from some economic sectors to others because the composition of the expansion seldom\nperfectly mirrors that of the contraction. Many of the workers that exit declining industries in the\ndownturn eventually find work in newly expanding industries in the recovery. That process can take some\ntime and perhaps retraining, since the skills required in the expanding sectors may not line up with the\nskills of those released from the contracting sectors. This process of sectoral reallocation could be a more\nprominent feature of this recession and recovery than in the past, resulting in greater skill mismatch than\nin past recoveries. While various indicators, such as the historically large pool of long-term unemployed,\nare suggestive, the mismatch hypothesis has been hard to pin down empirically.5\nPulling together all of these threads, my assessment of the economic outlook is not terribly different from\nthe conventional view. The central tendency among professional forecasters is that overall activity will\ncontinue to grow at a modest pace over the near term, somewhere between 2 and 3 percent, and I would\nagree. Like most forecasters, I believe the most likely scenario is for the rate of growth to gradually\nstrengthen during the next two years. But I would not be surprised if instead growth remained fairly\nmodest over that horizon; there is enough uncertainty in my mind regarding the current impediments to\ngrowth that I cannot rule out a less robust path.\n\nInflation\nI may part company with some forecasters on the inflation outlook, however. Last year, inflation, as\nmeasured by the price index for personal consumption expenditure, was 1.4 percent. In my mind that’s\njust where it needs to be over time. This year, however, inflation has averaged 3.3 percent at an annual\nrate. The surge in energy prices has played an important role, and as I noted earlier that surge was\ntemporary; indeed, crude oil prices have declined substantially since April. But inflation in other\ncategories has risen as well this year. Core inflation has averaged 2.2 percent at an annual rate this year,\ncompared to only 1.5 percent for last year. I agree that we have probably seen the worst monthly readings\nfor overall inflation this year, due to the recent declines in crude oil and gasoline prices, but I doubt\ninflation will fall much below 2 percent for a sustained period. Moreover, experience coming out of past\nrecessions suggests that the risks to inflation lie to the upside, so I do not believe we should relax our\nvigilance on inflation at this time.\n\nMonetary Policy\nI have yet to mention monetary policy, and for good reason. My reading of the evidence is that the\nstrength of this recovery is going to be relatively independent of our monetary policy choices from here\non out. The factors likely to be restraining growth — from empty houses to prospective tax rates — are\nnonmonetary and largely beyond the power of the central bank to offset through easier monetary\nconditions. History has repeatedly demonstrated that if a central bank attempts to add monetary stimulus\nto offset nonmonetary disturbances to growth, the result is higher inflation that can be difficult and costly\nto eliminate. This is why I opposed the Maturity Extension Program — popularly known as “Operation\n\n3\n\n\fTwist” — in which the Fed will buy long-term Treasury securities and simultaneously sell short-term\nTreasury securities. The effect of these operations is uncertain, but likely to be relatively small. My sense\nis that the main effect will be to raise inflation somewhat rather than increase growth.\nAt the September meeting, the FOMC also decided to reinvest principal payments from holdings of\nagency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (ABMS) in agency mortgage-backed securities,\nrather than in Treasury securities. This means that the Fed’s portfolio of agency securities will be\nmaintained at its current size rather than reduced over time to return the Fed’s balance sheet to an allTreasury composition. I also was unwilling to support this decision. I recognize the potential value of\nreducing retail mortgage rates by reducing the spread between AMBS and Treasuries. But doing so will\ncause an offsetting increase in the rates charged to other borrowers, and it’s not obvious whether the net\neffect on borrowing or growth will be positive or negative. More broadly, it’s simply inappropriate, in my\nview, for a central bank to attempt to channel credit toward some economic sectors and away from others.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nBefore closing, I would like to share a few thoughts about the Federal Reserve. Many observers have\ncommented on the fact that three members dissented at the last two FOMC meetings — the first time that\nhas happened since the early 1990s. This is, in my view, no cause for alarm. Economists can reach\ndifferent conclusions, based on legitimate scientific uncertainty about the structure of the economy and\ncurrent economic conditions. Reasonable economic policymakers thus can disagree, just as reasonable\nSupreme Court justices can disagree. In my experience as an FOMC participant since 2004, the\nCommittee has functioned with an exceptional level of collegiality. Differences have been aired candidly\nand respectfully, and the give and take of our debates has strengthened the FOMC’s collective\nunderstanding.\nThe fact that diverse and independent views are brought to bear on important policy questions is\nattributable in part to the unique federated structure of the Federal Reserve System. When the Fed was\nfounded in 1913, Congress deliberately rejected the monolithic model of the European central banks of\nthe time. By chartering 12 distinct banks, each with a board of directors that appoints their Reserve Bank\npresident (subject to approval by the Board of Governors), they deliberately sought to insulate\npolicymaking from election-induced swings that can distort decision-making by diminishing the focus on\nlong-run considerations. And while the Reserve Bank presidents are subject to oversight from both their\nown boards of directors and the Board of Governors in Washington, their distinct policy views are\ninformed by both regional economic information and the independent research of Reserve Bank\neconomists. This is why legislation that aims at stifling dissent by removing the presidents from the\nFOMC would be so harmful. By limiting the diversity of independent views around the table, such\nmeasures would undermine the historic strength of the System.\nWhile the governance structure of the Federal Reserve is somewhat unique within the array of U.S.\ngovernment entities, at the same time the Fed is highly transparent and strongly accountable to the\nAmerican people. Through the semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress, as well as testimony\nand speeches, Federal Reserve officials discuss and assess macroeconomic conditions and provide the\npublic with the opportunity to scrutinize the results of past policy actions. And in case you were\nwondering whether the Fed gets audited, the answer is “yes.” We publish externally-audited financial\nstatements and are regularly audited by the Government Accountability Office.6\n\n4\n\n\fConclusion\nIn closing, I want to leave you with one final thought about the economic outlook. I recognize that the\nprospect of continued modest growth over the near term may be uninspiring, particularly to the extent that\nunemployment is likely to remain elevated. But at the same time, the modest rate of growth in aggregate\neconomic measures masks the very significant economic dynamics that are going on at ground level.\nOpportunities continue to arise for individual firms to innovate and grow and for individuals to expand\ntheir talents. These are the dynamics that in the past have ultimately restored long-term growth after\neconomic disruptions. I remain confident that these same creative forces will do so once again.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb, John Weinberg and Laura Fortunato for their assistance in preparing this speech.\nHousing starts peaked in January 2006 and reached a low point in March 2009.\n3\nPayroll employment reached its low point in February 2010.\n4\nHousehold net worth fell by about 25 percent, from over $65 trillion to less than $50 trillion.\n5\nAndreas Hornstein and Thomas A.

            "content": "October 3, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nEconomics After the Crisis: Reflections on a Return to Madison\nUniversity of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.\nI am very grateful to the Economics Student Association for their invitation to return to the\nUniversity of Wisconsin, Madison campus. I literally have not been back since receiving my\ndegree in 1985, but that is no reflection on my time here. On the contrary, my time in graduate\nschool represents the most important and formative years of my professional life. When I left in\n1985, I envisioned pursuing a career in academia, not in central banking, and certainly not as a\npresident of a Federal Reserve Bank. But it was because of the people I met here and what I\nlearned from them that this career path was even a possibility for me. To these economists, some\nof whom are in the audience, I owe my eternal gratitude.\nI consider myself fortunate to have been afforded a role in economic policymaking at a U.S.\ninstitution that has been at the center of the most critical and contentious economic policy\ndecisions of the last few years. In our time together this afternoon, I would like to share some\nreflections on the implications of the events of these tumultuous years for the science of\neconomics. But, before I begin, I must note that the views I express are my own and are not\nnecessarily shared by any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nThere is a popular narrative of late according to which the financial crisis and Great Contraction\nhave eroded the credibility of economics. While there is still important research to be done that\ndeserves the attention and energy of young economists like you, I believe many critics have gone\noverboard. So my message for young economics students is that economics as a discipline\ncontinues to be relevant and well worth your time and effort.\nOne popular criticism is that economists did not foresee or predict the financial crisis that began\nin 2007 and culminated in the dramatic events in late 2008. In one sense, this charge is quite true.\nBut, it’s like criticizing seismologists for failing to predict the time and place of the earthquake\nthat recently struck in Mineral, Va., just 40 miles northwest of my Richmond office. As this\nanalogy suggests, I think that criticism is unfair. Just as seismology provides a rich\nunderstanding of the forces that led to the quake, the economics literature provides a rich\nunderstanding of the forces at work in the recent financial crisis.\nFor example, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig in 1983 published a celebrated paper 1\nshowing how financial intermediaries that engage in “maturity transformation” — that is,\nborrowing via short term, demandable liabilities to fund longer term or less liquid assets — could\nbe vulnerable to “runs.” That paper has provided the basic framework within which economists\ncontinue to study the logic of financial fragility. 2 That vulnerability has motivated deposit\n\n\finsurance and other forms of government-provided financial safety net protection, but such\nprotection for creditors can seriously distort incentives. A 1978 article by John Kareken and Neil\nWallace pointed out that deposit insurance gives insured banks and thrifts an incentive to take on\nsocially excessive amounts of risk and dampens their creditors’ incentive to monitor and\nconstrain such risk-taking. 3 Several years later, Kareken wrote about the critical role of\nregulation and supervision in constraining the excessive risk-taking incentives that result from\ndeposit insurance. 4 He cited the dangers of deregulating such institutions before commensurately\nstrengthening the supervisory regime to be able to contain the expanded bank and thrift risktaking capabilities. More recently, former Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern and his thencolleague Ron Feldman warned in a 2004 book about the distorted risk-taking incentives of large\nfinancial institutions that were viewed as “Too Big to Fail,” the title of their book. Without\ncorrective policies, they argued, excessive risk-taking was likely to cause problems and result in\nfurther instances of financial distress and bailouts, which is exactly what we have experienced.\nSeveral popular narratives regarding the Federal Reserve System also have emerged from the\ncrisis. Some of these are patently counterfactual, such as the notion that the Fed is not audited.\nThe regional Reserve Banks, just like private companies, are audited by an external audit firm, as\nwell as by internal audit staff. In addition, our operations are regularly examined by staff from\nthe Board of Governors and the Government Accountability Office. 5\nSome conventional narratives are less hostile to the Fed. For example, some view the Federal\nReserve’s extensive emergency lending as a vital palliative that was essential to overcoming the\ncrisis. In this view, such lending was consistent with the Fed’s historic Lender of Last Resort\nfunction and reflects the founding mission of the Federal Reserve Act to handle financial crises,\nalong the lines advocated by Walter Bagehot in 19th century England. 6\nThis conventional wisdom can be seriously misleading, in my view. Walter Bagehot wrote\nbefore the advent of open market operations, when lending was the most expeditious way for the\nBank of England to increase the money supply to accommodate an increase in the demand for\nmoney during financial panics. His famous dictum to “lend freely at a penalty rate” was a\nsensible prescription, given the institutional arrangements of his day, for varying the money\nsupply during financial panics in a way that preserved monetary stability. This is quite different\nfrom the sterilized lending that central banks typically engage in. Indeed, the first large increases\nin Fed lending during the financial crisis were sterilized by offsetting sales from the System’s\nholdings of U.S. Treasury securities, and it wasn’t until the Fall of 2008 that Fed lending became\narguably Bagehotian. And even for those and subsequent expansions of Fed credit, appeals to\nBagehot fail to justify central bank credit allocation.\nAt the founding of the Federal Reserve in 1913, the American banking system was highly\nfragmented. The need to clear and settle interbank payments efficiently gave rise to a network of\ninterregional “correspondent” banking relationships to settle via debits and credits to interbank\ndeposits. In addition, clearinghouses in the major cities economized on bilateral transactions\ncosts via multilateral netting. During financial panics clearinghouses met the increased demand\nfor currency by issuing clearinghouse certificates. Country banks often had difficulty converting\nbank balances into currency to meet their local demands.\n\n2\n\n\fBanking reform debates in the years leading up to the establishment of the Fed were essentially\nabout the governance of financial crisis resolution, not about taxpayer-financed lending. They\nreflected dissatisfaction among banks outside New York at not being able to withdraw their\nreserve deposits in a crisis. A method of expanding note issue nationwide in a crisis was sought.\nBut, a single centralized institution, modeled on the central banks of Europe, was a nonstarter\npolitically because of the risk it would be dominated by the large New York banks. The Federal\nReserve System, with its twelve regional Reserve Banks, represented a network of governmentsponsored clearinghouses with potentially universal membership. Like other clearinghouses, they\nwould be owned and governed by member banks, but would be coordinated by a government\nagency in Washington. The preamble to the Federal Reserve Act spells out their central purpose:\n“to furnish an elastic currency” — that is, to expand the supply of notes in response to shifts in\ndemand. This is just what the clearinghouses did; the difference was in who would be calling the\nshots. The Federal Reserve was founded not to resolve financial crises, but to give those outside\nNew York or Washington a greater voice in how they were resolved. This governance issue is\nstill with us today — as is the need for the Reserve Bank system.\nWhen the Federal Reserve was founded, the operation of the gold standard pinned down inflation\ntrends. The departure from the gold standard forty years ago resulted in a fiat money regime in\nwhich inflation is driven by current and expected central bank policy. Without the nominal\nanchor provided by the gold standard, central banks around the world struggled in the 1970s to\nresist political pressure to inflate in order to (temporarily) reduce unemployment or finance\ngovernment deficits. Governance arrangements that were workable when central banks were\nfounded a century or more ago — namely, ministerial control to assure politically desirable\nmanagement of public sector clearinghouses — became a liability under a fiat money regime,\nwhen the short-term focus of political leaders made them willing to sacrifice inflation control for\nthe immediate gains associated with stimulus. Independence from political pressures ultimately\nbecame critical to central banks’ ability to reduce inflation and sustain credible commitments to\nprice stability.\nMany central banks outside the U.S. received new charters in the 1980s and 1990s, making them\nmore independent of, though still strongly accountable to, governments and legislatures. In the\nU.S., the participation on the FOMC of Reserve Bank presidents, who are appointed by their\nboard of directors, along with the 14-year tenure of Federal Reserve Board governors, helps\nprotect policymaking from short-run political pressures. This hybrid public-private governance\nstructure builds in an ability to insulate policymaking from election-induced swings and to make\npolicy choices based on long-run considerations. At the same time, the Fed is strongly\naccountable at the level of macroeconomic results. Through the semi-annual Monetary Policy\nReport to Congress, as well as testimony and speeches, Federal Reserve officials discuss and\nassess macroeconomic conditions and provide the public with the opportunity to scrutinize the\nresults of past policy actions.\nPolitical pressures have again been targeted at Fed policymaking in recent weeks. Attempts at\nintimidation should perhaps not be surprising, given the severe economic stress facing our\nnation, and the fierce partisan debate that has enveloped economic policy. But these are precisely\nthe times when the governance structure that shields the Fed from such short-term pressures is\ncritically important.\n3\n\n\fCentral bank independence is a double-edged sword, however. While independence has helped\nenhance the credibility of central banks’ commitment to price stability in many countries, it also\nprovides central banks with the capability to circumvent the constitutional checks and balances\nsurrounding conventional fiscal policy. When a large financial institution is hit by financial\ndistress, policymakers face an inevitable temptation to insulate creditors from the consequences\nof default or failure. Such events often unfold rapidly, and a central bank’s independent balance\nsheet gives it the ability to provide assistance without the delays associated with legislative\ndeliberations. As an off-budget vehicle for transferring private risks to taxpayers, central bank\nlending is often sought out by governments and the private sector alike. This may be the single\nmost important factor explaining the secular rise of “too big to fail,” the observed propensity of\npolicymakers to prevent large financial institutions from utilizing established bankruptcy\nprocedures.\nThis narrative may differ from the conventional wisdom. But for me, it provides a persuasive\nunderstanding of the events of the last hundred years of Fed history. The founders of the Fed\ncertainly did not envision all of the challenges of the past century. The Fed has had to learn how\nto use its unique political status in the best interest of the nation’s economy — how to ensure\nlong term monetary stability in a fiat money regime, for instance. The pressing challenge now is\nto learn how to constrain the Fed’s ability to allocate credit in a way that preserves the\nindependence of its balance sheet management from political pressures. The next hundred years\nwill no doubt present the Federal Reserve with new challenges and new lessons to learn as well.\nBut the Fed’s federated structure has also made it a capable learner over time, and this gives me\nconfidence that we will continue to find ways to improve our performance as the nation’s central\nbank. Given the continued strength and vitality of the Wisconsin economics tradition, I hope that\nthe Fed will have the benefit of talented Badger alum over the next hundred years as well.\n1\n\nDouglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance and Liquidity,” Journal of Political\nEconomy, June 1983, vol. 91 no. 3, pp. 401-19.\n2\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, First Quarter 2010, A Special Issue on the DiamondDybvig Model and Its Implications for Banking and Monetary Policy.\n3\nJohn H.

            "content": "Sept. 7, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nImmediate Funds Transfer: A Central Bank Perspective\nImmediate Funds Transfer Symposium, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, Illinois\nI am honored to be asked to speak at this conference. I have had a longstanding interest in\npayment economics, particularly the economics of payments systems innovations. From that\nperspective, the topic of this conference ─ immediate funds transfer ─ is intriguing because what\nit represents ─ low-cost, real-time funds transfer for all ─ sounds like payments system nirvana.\nI would like to use my remarks today to review some of the thinking that I and others ─ mostly\nothers ─ have devoted over the years to the role of the central bank in the payments system,\nparticularly in regard to payments innovations. I also would like to emphasize that these remarks\nare my own and the views expressed are not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.1 Central banks have a natural interest in the development and evolution of\npayments systems. In fact, one could legitimately say that payments systems are central to\ncentral banking. The processes by which payments get made, cleared and settled represent the\nmechanics of monetary exchange, and the characteristics of these systems can affect the\ntransmission of monetary policy to economic activity and inflation.2 Related, most payment\narrangements achieve finality through the transfer of central bank liabilities, whether in the\npayment of cash at the point of sale or in the transfer of reserve balances between the banks of\nthe payer and payee. Indeed, the historic origin of central banks is as public sector intermediaries\nfor the clearing and settling of payments, such as bills of exchange ─ central banks are\nessentially nationalized clearinghouses.3\nThe Federal Reserve’s interest in the payments system has long been organized around its threefold goal of efficiency, integrity and accessibility. To an economist’s ear, the first two of these\nsound more like a single goal of economic efficiency more broadly defined. Integrity is an\nattribute of a payment instrument or process, and the public policy objective, in this regard,\nshould be that payments embody a socially efficient degree of integrity ─ that is, the degree of\nintegrity that maximizes the social benefit net of social costs.4 In the central bank lexicon, the\nterm “efficiency” is often construed more narrowly as the minimization of resource costs. The\ngoal of accessibility, in turn, suggests a public policy concern for the distribution of costs and\nbenefits among payments system participants and intermediaries. In the history of the Fed’s\ninvolvement in payments, this has taken the form of shielding small depository institutions from\ntoo large a share of the common costs associated with clearing and settlement systems.\n(Common costs are those that are not attributable to particular users or sets of users.) This aligns\nwith the Fed’s founding purpose of realigning, in favor of “country” banks, the governance of\nhow financial crises are resolved.\n\n1\n\n\fThe importance of common costs and the distributional questions they raise are the result of the\ntechnological nature of payments systems. At their most basic, these are systems that\ncommunicate and process information ─ instructions regarding the transfer of bank balances, to\nbe precise. The dramatic innovations in information processing and communication technology\nthat we have seen in recent decades have made payments practices feasible that not too long ago\nwere utopian. People can now carry around with them their own personal connections to\nuniversal communications networks, creating the possibility of retail payments initiation using\nmobile devices. Computational advances have allowed settlement systems ─ for instance in the\nCHIPS or CLS services ─ that economize on both central bank balances and counterparty credit\nin making “wholesale” payments. The immediate funds transfer services that are the topic of this\nconference take advantage of newer technologies to create a payment service that blurs the\ntraditional distinctions between “wholesale” and “retail” payments.\nImmediate payments also can be thought of as an attempt to move payments further away from\ntheir batch processing history. Gathering many payment instructions into a single file for\ncommunication and processing made sense in a world where there were economies of scale in\nbatch size. But the evolution of technology has reduced the fixed cost associated with individual\ncommunication packets, which makes batch processing less compelling as a means of\neconomizing on the resource costs of payment clearing and settlement. For example, I am told\nthat a majority of the ACH files presented to the Federal Reserve contain just a single item.\nWhen technological progress makes possible new ways of initiating, clearing or settling\npayments, delay in the realization of the anticipated improvements is sometimes taken as\nevidence of market failure and as a motivation for the involvement of the central bank. Indeed, it\nis common to hear payments systems referred to as “public goods.” Clearly they are not. Public\ngoods have the technological characteristic that they are provided jointly to many users and,\ncrucially, are not excludable, meaning that one cannot easily prevent enjoyment of the benefits\n(or costs) of provision. Payments systems are provided jointly to many users, but a user’s\nparticipation can easily be prevented, so they are club goods, not public goods. The efficiency\ncase for government intervention in markets for club goods is much harder to make, and\nintervention tends to be motivated by considerations related to the allocation of joint or common\ncosts.\nIt’s also common to hear talk of “barriers” to adoption of payments improvements, a word choice\nthat suggests forces inhibiting the market from moving in an obviously superior direction. The\nstubborn persistence of checks as a dominant means of payment in the U.S., even as electronic\nalternatives became increasingly available, was a widely-cited example for many years, as was\nthe persistently slow adoption by the banking industry of electronic means for clearing and\nprocessing paper checks. The dramatic change we have seen on the processing side came about\nafter changes not just in the costs of handling and storing check images, but also in the legal\nrights surrounding check presentment. This suggests that check collection may have been\nreasonably efficient, in the broader economic sense, given the legal regime in place prior to the\nCheck 21 legislation. It also suggests that central banks should be on the lookout for\nopportunities to use their good offices to advocate for legislation that removes legal barriers to\nprivate sector efforts to improve the economic efficiency of the payments system.\n\n2\n\n\fIn the history of efforts to speed up payments through electronification, much of the perceived\nbenefit has stemmed from the reduction in float. But the value of float ─ the forgone interest,\nthat is ─ represents a transfer from the payee to the payer, and without explaining what keeps\ntrading parties from taking this into account when voluntarily agreeing on their payment\narrangements, it’s hard to see float as a source of market failure.5 When payment instruments do\nnot accrue interest while in the process of settlement, there is a socially wasteful incentive to\nattempt to speed up payments to minimize forgone interest. Perhaps in the past the cost of\ncalculating and crediting interest on payments being cleared may have exceeded the social cost\nassociated with inefficiently “chasing float.” One under-appreciated side benefit of the current\nexceptionally low level of interest rates is that it minimizes the inefficiency associated with\nchasing float.\nI believe we should be cautious about assessments of the private adoption of innovations, both in\nthe payments arena and elsewhere; they are much more complicated than is implied by the\nlanguage of “public goods” or “barriers.” For example, the popular understanding of the Fed’s\noriginal entry into the business of clearing checks holds that the banking industry’s\nfragmentation was a barrier to the creation of an efficient, nationwide check clearing system. I\nbelieve the record shows, though, that the evidence for inefficiency of pre-Fed check clearing is\nweak, and that the Fed’s entry was motivated by the desire to reduce the burden of the higher\nreserve requirements associated with Fed membership. My sense is that the effects of our entry\nhad more to do with re-allocating the common costs of clearing checks, especially checks drawn\non small banks outside of major cities, than it did with payments system efficiency per se.6\nAs I noted earlier, general-use immediate funds transfer seems to represent a natural evolutionary\nresponse to recent technological advances, and as such, would appear to offer an obvious\nimprovement. From that perspective, non-adoption might be interpreted as a failure of the\npayments marketplace. But this is a tricky conclusion to draw. The private value of alternative\npayment methods and practices to end users (for instance, buyers and sellers in commercial\ntransactions) is very hard to identify and measure. Even harder is identifying the reasons, and\nquantifying the extent to which, social costs and benefits deviate from private costs and benefits.\nThe failure of many proposed payments innovations in the mid-1990s offers a valuable lesson in\nthe risks of pre-judging the viability of an innovative payment arrangement.\nWhat can the central bank do to further the goal of payments innovations that promote economic\nefficiency? Central bank obligations play a special role in the payments system because they are\nfree of credit risk. Certainly, a central bank should ensure the integrity and cost efficiency of the\ncore interbank settlement functions it performs. Settlement on the books of the central bank can\nbe a key part of any new payment service or process, so effective provision of this service is\nvital. It’s also important that this core central bank service not create competitive inequities\namong competing private sector networks. That is, a central bank should strive to ensure that\naccess to settlement promotes the contestability of markets. The Fed’s net settlement service for\nprivate clearing networks is a good model for such a universally accessible settlement process,\nwhich levels the playing field among potential competitors.\nIf a central bank plays an expanded operational role ─ clearing retail payments, for example ─ it\nshould ensure that these activities also contribute to economic efficiency. Although such roles\nare distinct from the core central bank roles related to currency and reserve balances, they may\n3\n\n\fbe justified if there are complementarities that make it more efficient to bundle clearing and\nsettlement with the maintenance of central bank account balances. But a question worth asking is\nwhether technological advances that have clearly reduced the cost of communications between\nfinancial entities have reduced these complementarities and made it easier to separate the various\nfunctions that make up the payments system. And if so, does this create greater opportunities for\nmore of those clearing functions to be handled outside the central bank?\nA central bank should also take care that the processes by which its own clearing services access\ncentral bank settlement services are neither artificially advantageous nor disadvantageous\nrelative to the settlement terms it provides to private clearing networks. For example, settlement\nof Federal Reserve check and ACH transactions bypasses the controls of the net settlement\nservice through which private competitors are required to settle. Such disparities have the\npotential to affect the terms of competition among public and private networks.\nBecause the nature of payments is such that barriers to effective competition could arise among\nprivate participants, payment services markets are always likely to attract the attention of\ncompetition policy authorities. Even if it does not have primary responsibility for enforcing procompetitive policy in payments markets, the central bank is likely to be an important public\nsector source of expertise in payments. Because the payments system represents the mechanics\nof monetary exchange, the central bank needs to be well informed about developments and\npractices among all payments system participants.\nThe same technological and network characteristics that create potential market power problems\ncreate challenges for payments systems operated by the central bank or other public sector\nentities. In much of its payment services activity, the Fed has relied on the cost recovery rules\nmandated by the Monetary Control Act as a tool to ensure that its provision of services is\nconsistent with overall economic efficiency. While this has been a largely effective policy, a\ncentral bank’s role as a provider of services can create particular challenges for the promotion\nand adoption of payment innovations.7 A public sector provider of services needs to take care\nthat the terms under which it serves customers, particularly in those market segments for which it\nmay have a competitive advantage, do not distort the evaluation of the potential net benefits of\nnew products or processes. Moreover, such a provider should scrupulously avoid using a\ncompetitive advantage in a legacy market to subsidize entry into an emerging market.\nFinally, we shouldn’t forget that payments innovation incentives can depend critically on the\ncentral bank’s performance of its most central role ─ the maintenance of price stability. This is\nespecially true of innovations intended to reduce the time between initiation and settlement of a\npayment. In an environment with high inflation and thus high nominal interest rates, the value of\nfloat can have a powerful effect on the payment choices of individuals and intermediaries.\nSpeeding up payments may yield benefits associated with the reduction of risk, but speeding up\npayments simply to reduce the transfer associated with float represents socially wasteful\ninvestments in innovation ─ the modern counterpart of the classic textbook account of the “shoe\nleather” costs of inflation. So it seems appropriate ─ and certainly consistent with my personal\nviews on monetary policy ─ to end on this note: Perhaps the most important thing a central bank\ncan do to promote efficient payments innovation is to provide an environment of stable prices, so\nthat the payments system decision makers ─ like other economic decision makers ─ can better\njudge the true costs and benefits of alternative choices.\n4\n\n\f1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this speech.\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "July 28, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nWhat Does the Path to Full Recovery Look Like?\nDulles Regional Chamber of Commerce\nChantilly, Virginia\n\nThank you for that kind introduction, Bruce. It’s a pleasure to speak with you today, especially\nsince this venue is air conditioned and it’s 95 degrees outside. More importantly, though, this is\nan economically important and unique region within the Fifth Federal Reserve District. The\nfertile mixture of technology- and defense-related industries has, over the years, given rise to a\nstrong and vibrant agglomeration of human capital that can serve as a powerful engine of\nregional growth going forward. Prospects for the path of economic growth in this area, as well as\nthe northern Virginia region more broadly, look bright, in my view.\nMy topic today, though, will be growth at the national level. I’d like to start by saying that the\nU.S. economy is growing rapidly, jobs are becoming more plentiful and inflation is low.\nUnfortunately, as much as I would like to paint such a rosy picture, the reality is quite different;\nunemployment is high, inflation has risen and economic growth has been decidedly mediocre.\nThese facts are behind us and there’s nothing we can do about them. The more important\nquestion is what happens from here? What does the path to full recovery look like? That’s what\nI’m going to talk about today. I should emphasize that these remarks are my own and the views\nexpressed are not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.1\nI will begin with a bit of background on current economic conditions as a precursor to\nunderstanding where we might be headed. The Great Recession officially ended in June 2009.\nSince then, the rebound in economic activity has been disappointing. Over the last century or\nmore, economic activity has fluctuated, but has shown a remarkable tendency to return to trend.\nTo be more precise, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), our best measure of total production in\nthe economy, has fluctuated around a trend line corresponding to growth at a rate very close to 3\npercent a year. In recessions, real GDP falls below that trend line. When coming out of a\nrecession, real GDP has typically grown several percentage points faster than the 3 percent longrun trend rate. This time, real GDP has risen at a 2-¾ percent annual rate since the end of the\nrecession. With growth at this rate, we are not reducing excess productive capacity and\nunemployment will remain high. So what accounts for this sluggish performance?\nMost obviously, housing construction is severely depressed. Our prior 10-year boom in housing\nleft us with too many houses, given our population. New housing fell by 79 percent before\nbottoming out in the spring of 2009. Since then, home construction has made virtually no\ncontribution to economic growth. Following earlier recessions, though, housing often contributed\nsignificantly to the growth in overall activity. For example, following the recessions that ended\n1\n\n\fin 1975 and in 1982, residential investment added 1-¾ percentage points to GDP growth. So, if\nwe simply had a positive contribution from housing, this recovery would have looked noticeably\nbetter.\nWhile housing has played a significant role, consumer spending has been even more important in\nexplaining the weakness of this recovery. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of GDP,\nand thus healthy growth in this category is vital to a strong recovery. Normally that’s the case; at\nthe end of a recession consumers will see brighter times ahead and will boost spending even if\nincomes are temporarily depressed. But in this recovery, real consumer spending has been\nrelatively sluggish, rising at only a 2 percent annual rate. This picture has not been improving\nbecause real consumer spending has risen at only a 1.1 percent annual rate over the last six\nmonths. There are ample reasons for consumers to be cautious in their spending plans.\nHousehold net worth dropped by over $15 trillion during the downturn and has not fully\nrecovered.\nAn even more important reason for tepid consumer spending growth has been the condition of\nthe labor market. The downturn in employment lasted for 25 months, and during that time the\nnation lost 8-¾ million jobs. We only began to add jobs, on net, in March of last year, and have\nonly added 1-¾ million jobs in the 16 months that ended in June. At this slow pace, it will take\nmore than another five years for employment to get back to the high point it hit in January 2008.\nAnother facet of weak labor markets has been slowing growth in wages. In the last 12 months\naverage hourly earnings grew by only 1.9 percent, less than inflation and less than half the\ngrowth rate we observed before the recession.\nSo far, I’ve focused on the gloomiest sectors of the economy – housing and consumer spending.\nThese are partially counterbalanced by some sectors that have been turning in an above-average\nperformance. Business investment in equipment and software has increased by 25 percent since\nthe end of the recession, adding 1.1 percent to GDP growth. And exports of goods and services\nhave increased 21 percent since the end of the recession, adding 2.4 percent to GDP growth. So\nfor balance, it is necessary to keep these bright spots in mind.\nThe inflation outlook is one key aspect of the current situation that gets less attention than it\ndeserves. Last year inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditure, was a modest 1.1 percent. But the prices of crude oil and many other commodities\nincreased sharply toward the end of last year and early this year, and naturally found their way\ninto consumer prices. Inflation averaged over 4 percent at an annual rate over the first five\nmonths of this year. Clearly gasoline prices accounted for much of this inflation surge, but other\nprices have accelerated as well. The core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices,\nhas risen at a 2.3 percent annual rate year-to-date, well above last year’s core inflation rate.\nWhile oil prices have stabilized of late and have reduced overall inflation, this is likely to prove\ntemporary and I expect inflation to average close to 2 percent over the coming year.\nAs I noted earlier, the pace of the recovery has been disappointing compared to historical\nexperience. In the early stages of past recoveries, particularly those following sharp downturns,\nthe economy typically expanded at rates well above the long run average of about 3 percent per\n\n\fyear; GDP growth rates of 5 or 6 percent were not uncommon. While that hasn’t happened, most\neconomic forecasters continue to expect growth to pick up to over 3 percent. This outlook is\nlargely driven by the U.S. historical data, which shows that for more than a century, economic\nactivity, as measured by gross domestic product, has generally fluctuated within a tight band\naround a simple trend line that grows at a constant 3 percent per year. Periods during which\ngrowth slows and the economy falls below the trend line are soon offset by subsequent periods of\nfaster growth in which the economy rises back above the trend.\nThe logic for such a consistent pattern is straightforward. Over time, the economy’s capacity for\nproducing goods and services expands with the growth of technological capabilities. While\nproductive capabilities may suffer set backs from time to time – like the disruptions caused by a\nsharp rise in the price of energy – these tend to be temporary. They don’t permanently impair\ngrowth in the economy’s productive capacity.\nIn the current recovery, there are certainly reasons to expect that the most recent slowdown in\ngrowth could be temporary. These are reflected in most forecasters’ outlooks for the second half\nof this year and beyond. For instance, second quarter growth was held down by supply-chain\ndisruptions in the auto industry and elsewhere due to the Japanese earthquake and tsunami; those\nproblems have eased and should contribute to a noticeable improvement in the third quarter. In\naddition, business investment in equipment and software is likely to remain robust, as technology\ncontinues to advance across a broad front and businesses find opportunities to improve\nefficiency. Technological progress also plays an important role in our nation’s exports, which\nhave made strong contributions to growth in this recovery. Many of our key exports are capital\ngoods, and overseas growth is especially rapid in the emerging economies that are equipping\nincreasing numbers of their workers with up-to-date capital goods. Thus growth in countries such\nas China, India and Brazil should support U.S. export demand for many years ahead.\nEven the weaker areas of the economy are likely to be less problematic going forward. The\nslowdown in consumer spending growth this spring was attributable, in part, to the elevation in\nretail energy prices since last year. Energy prices seem to have plateaued, and as long as energy\nprices do not worsen significantly from here, consumer spending is likely to regain some\nmomentum in the months ahead. Moreover, many households have been saving more and paying\ndown debts, and a rising stock market boosted household wealth by $10 trillion over the last two\nyears. Household balance sheets thus should provide further support to household spending.\nIn my view, the expectation that the economy will soon conform to historical norms and grow\nfast enough to begin returning us to the 20th century trend line is still quite reasonable. Indeed, a\nbroad array of private forecasters, as well as many of my colleagues on the FOMC, embody this\nview in their baseline forecasts. The central tendency of the projections of FOMC participants, as\nreported following our June meeting, is for real GDP growth to rise to around 4 percent over the\nnext two years, which closely aligns with my own forecast.\nThere is, however, a less promising scenario that now seems plausible as well – namely, that the\neconomy is settling into a period of growth at roughly a trend rate of around 3 percent, without\nthe period of faster “catch-up” growth we’re accustomed to after a recession. In effect, this\n\n\fwould mean that the economy has suffered a permanent (or at least very long lasting) reduction\nin the level of economic activity. The economy would track a new trend line, parallel to – but\ndistinctly lower than – the long-term trend line around which we had previously fluctuated.\nI do not think we can completely rule out such an outcome, although I should say that, at this\npoint, I view it as less likely than my baseline forecast for gradually increasing growth. While\nthere is no hard evidence for the lower-trend-line hypothesis, other than the disappointing nature\nof the recovery so far, some observers have pointed out that changes in tax and regulatory policy,\nboth actual and anticipated, are capable of bringing about such a permanent effect on output and\nconsumption growth. Some observers also emphasize significant uncertainty about such policy\nchanges as a factor limiting hiring and investment. The list of significant recent and prospective\npolicy changes should be familiar: It would include the health care and financial reform bills of\nthe last two years, as well as wholesale shifts in environmental regulations. On the tax side, there\nremains considerable uncertainty as to how long-run fiscal balance will be achieved and the\nextent to which various marginal tax rates might change as a result. On top of all that,\nuncertainty about federal expenditures has a direct dampening effect on businesses that supply to\nand people who work for the federal government. The high level of extended unemployment\nbenefits is also cited by many observers as a factor dampening labor supply and restraining\nemployment growth.\nQuantifying these effects is virtually impossible. But since early 2009, we have been hearing\nwidespread anecdotal reports from business contacts in the Fifth District about the chilling effect\nof prospective regulatory and tax changes. Many say that projecting the need for and financial\nimplications of hiring and investment commitments is exceptionally difficult in this policy\nenvironment.\nIn a much-publicized recent lecture, Nobel economist Robert Lucas has speculated about\nwhether the policy mix in the U.S. is moving closer to that of other developed economies,\nespecially many European countries.2 These economies generally have higher tax rates, more\ngenerous social safety nets, and more regulated labor and goods markets than we’ve had in the\nU.S. They also generally employ less of their labor force and produce less output per capita than\nthe U.S., although they tend to have roughly the same average rate of growth. Since recovering\nfrom World War II, measures of economic activity in those countries have converged to trend\nlines parallel to but significantly below the one the U.S. tracked prior to this recession.\nThese two possible paths essentially bracket the range of reasonably likely trajectories for the\neconomy in the near and medium term. The growth rate could rise to 4 percent over the next two\nyears and allow us to gradually make up the ground lost in the recession. Or growth could\ncontinue at around 2-¾ percent, keeping the level of economic activity persistently below the\n20th century trend line. At present, I do not feel we face significant risk of growth much below\nthat, or of an outright contraction. On the other hand, there is a possibility of an unexpected\nacceleration in growth to more robust rates – this has happened in past recoveries, though I view\nthat as a good deal less likely than growth paths within the range bounded by 2-¾ and 4 percent.\n\n\fWhat does this imply for monetary policy? I believe that which of these two possible recovery\npaths we realize is relatively independent of our monetary policy choices at this point. Professor\nLucas’s conjecture that the U.S. economy might not achieve more than 3 percent growth in the\ncoming quarters is equivalent to saying that the path of our economy’s productive capacity,\ngiven current tax and regulatory policies, will be lower than we thought. In this case, monetary\nstimulus can do little for real growth without creating appreciable inflationary pressures. Even in\nthe more encouraging scenario, however, the factors that have held back growth this year – and\nseem likely to abate – are largely beyond the power of the central bank to offset.\nMore broadly, it seems unlikely that the forces limiting the pace at which U.S. growth is\nrecovering are amenable to monetary policy. As evidence, consider the difference between the\neconomic outlook now and at this time last year. In the summer of 2010, growth was sluggish\nbut projected to rise gradually and inflation was running at or below 1 percent. Now, growth is\nstill sluggish, but inflation is running at 2 percent or more. This circumstantial evidence suggests\nthat the additional monetary stimulus initiated last November raised inflation and did little to\nimprove real growth. Last year, raising inflation was a desirable policy objective, but that clearly\nis not the case today. Given current inflation trends, additional monetary stimulus at this juncture\nseems likely to raise inflation to undesirably high levels and do little to spur real growth.\nFor many, if not most people, real economic recovery means more improvement in labor market\nconditions than we’ve seen to date. But such improvement ultimately depends on the pace at\nwhich the economy’s production and consumption of goods and services grows. Production has\nfallen well below the historical trend of the 20th century. When that has happened in the past,\nrecovery has brought us back to the old trend. Whether and when this will happen in this\nrecovery is becoming increasingly hard to predict, but the stakes are becoming increasingly high.\nWhile I remain cautiously optimistic that the path of our recovery will take us back to historical\ntrends, the possibility of persistently lagging behind our 20th century trend is a pointed reminder\nthat changes in an array of seemingly microeconomic policies could have macroeconomic\nimplications that are highly consequential.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg and Roy Webb for assistance in preparing this speech.\nRobert E.

            "content": "June 13, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nManufacturing in the New Southern Economy\nSouthern Growth’s 2011 Chairman’s Conference\nRoanoke, Virginia\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you today. The focus of this gathering ─ manufacturing\nin the economies of the American South ─ is a timely one, and well-deserves the attention of\nsenior policy makers. Manufacturing has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise\nlackluster economic recovery, and understanding what has driven that performance can suggest\npromising directions in public policy. Beyond purely cyclical considerations, however, the\nlonger-term evolution of manufacturing industries has played ─ and is likely to continue to play\n─ a vital role in the growth of living standards over time. I therefore commend Governors\nBarbour, Haslam, McDonnell and Perdue for their attention to this important subject.\nIn my remarks this morning, I want to provide you with an overview of the evolution of\nmanufacturing in the South. My theme will be the role of comparative advantage. Indeed, it\nwould be hard to make progress thinking about the geographic distribution of manufacturing, or\nany other economic activity for that matter, without it. Viewed through the lens of comparative\nadvantage, the story of manufacturing in the South has two central threads ─ the migration of\nlow-skilled jobs overseas and the growing need for higher-skilled workers. The main message\nfor policymakers is to think very carefully about the sources of comparative advantage and how\nthey change over time. In particular, if the comparative advantage of Southern and U.S.\nmanufacturing in the global marketplace rests increasingly on technical expertise and skills, then\na first-order policy issue for the future is how to facilitate people’s investments in human capital.\nThis has implications for, among other things, the full spectrum of educational policies, from\nearly childhood through secondary education to vocational and higher education.\nA Bright Spot in the Economy\nTo set the stage for my overview, I want to briefly review current economic conditions. I would\nlike to emphasize that these remarks are my own and the views expressed are not necessarily\nshared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.1 The U.S. economy is now about two\nyears into its recovery from the Great Recession of 2008-2009. The popular narrative is that the\nrecession was caused by the abrupt reversal of the boom in home prices and home construction\nthat had consumed much of the previous decade. While the decline in residential construction\nand related sectors was pronounced, the economic downturn did not become widespread and\nsevere until late in 2008, when financial turmoil and policy responses dramatically heightened\nuncertainty and brought discretionary spending by businesses and consumers to a screeching\n\n1\n\n\fhalt. A notable feature of the worsening of the recession in late 2008 was the sharp collapse of\nworldwide trade in manufactured goods.\nThe recovery that began in the second half of 2009 has been patchy and has yet to produce a\nsustained period of above-trend growth. While 2010 ended with renewed strength in household\nspending, that strength abated early this year. Although the factors affecting the first quarter\nslowdown ─ including high energy prices, bad weather and natural disasters around the globe ─\nmay prove temporary, the inability so far of the expansion to gain more traction has been\nfrustrating.\nOne bright spot since the end of the recession, perhaps surprisingly, has been manufacturing. I\nsay surprisingly because manufacturing was not a particular source of strength in the preceding\nexpansion. The average growth rate of industrial production in the manufacturing sector in this\nrecovery has been over 6 percent per year, compared to less than 3 percent from 2002 through\n2007. Employment tends to grow much more slowly than output in manufacturing, reflecting the\nongoing gains in worker productivity that result from new capital equipment and improved\nproduction processes. Thus manufacturing employment has grown at a 1-½ percent annual rate\nin this recovery, but actually declined at a 2 percent annual rate from 2002 through 2007.\nA common theme in manufacturing over the last decade ─ both in the South and in the U.S.─\nhas been the movement of lower-skill production operations overseas to countries with lower\nreal labor costs. This transition has had a particularly strong effect in some of the industries that\nwere traditionally prominent on the landscape of southern manufacturing, such as furniture,\napparel and textiles.\nThe beneficiaries of that movement were countries such as China and India, which were\ntransitioning from rural economies to more modern, industrial ones. Their comparative\nadvantage rests on the large workforces that have yet to benefit from the application of modern\ncapital goods. The fact that the relevant alternative use of those workers is in relatively lowproductivity agricultural activities pins down their real wage at fairly low rates. As these\neconomies move people from agricultural to manufacturing sectors, their demand for more\nsophisticated manufactured capital equipment rises. Some developed economies, most notably\nGermany’s, have long specialized in the export of such technology and other skill-intensive\ngoods. A portion of the rebound in U.S. manufacturing since the recession appears to be\nconcentrated in the capital goods segment of the industry as well. Domestic U.S. demand for\ncapital equipment also has been robust, driven by firms finding ways to streamline business\nprocesses and reduce costs through productivity-enhancing investments.\nEmployment and output trends in U.S. manufacturing over the last decade are consistent with an\neconomy that is increasingly becoming a supplier of higher cost, high-tech goods. Ten years of\ndeclining manufacturing employment, as output continued to rise, suggest a transition to less\nlabor-intensive production. This relatively greater use of capital and technology in production\nalso shows through to the relative demand for different skill sets in the labor force. The widening\nof the wage inequality gap in the U.S. over the last thirty years has been linked in part by many\nobservers to the adoption of technology that favors higher-skilled workers.2 While the\nadjustments brought about by these trends have been difficult for many firms, workers and\n2\n\n\fcommunities, the transition of U.S. manufacturing ultimately places it in a better position for the\nyears ahead.\nThe Evolution of Manufacturing in the South\nThe last 50 years has seen a widely documented shift of population to the South.3 As a region,\nSouthern population has more than doubled, and its growth rate on average has been about 30\npercent faster than the nation as a whole. Not surprisingly, total employment in the region has\nclosely followed suit, also more than doubling and averaging about 35 percent faster growth than\nthe nation over the same period. Clearly, people have been drawn to the region for a variety of\nreasons, including retirement (thanks to the spread of air conditioning) and job opportunities.\nThe in-migration of jobs has in part reflected the South’s historic comparative advantage in lowcost labor, relative to manufacturing regions in the Northeast and Midwest. This advantage\nresulted in part from the South’s later transition from an agrarian to a more industrial economy\nand in part from the smaller role of organized labor in Southern factories. The South’s gains in\nmanufacturing jobs over this period thus mirrored the more recent loss of jobs to overseas\nmanufacturers, as illustrated strikingly by the life cycle of the textile industry, which was lured\nfrom New England, which had previously lured it from the United Kingdom.\nMany of the waves of new jobs coming to the South have tended to require more skill and have\ntended to pay commensurately higher wage rates. For example, in the last few decades several\nauto assembly plants have been built in the South, giving rise to a network of supply firms\nlocated in close proximity. Many foreign-based auto manufacturers have built plants in the U.S.\nbecause the costs associated with importing cars made abroad often outweigh the advantages of\nlower-cost foreign labor. The South has been able to compete successfully against other regions\nwithin the U.S. for auto assembly plants. Even though these plants pay well below the national\naverage for the industry, they still pay well above the average wage of the “old” manufacturing\njobs that remain in the region and are helping to narrow the gap in per capita income that\ncontinues to persist in the region relative to the national average.\nThe story is similar for other new manufacturing industries, such as aerospace and\npharmaceuticals. In many cases, it appears as if the attractiveness of locating manufacturing\nfacilities within the U.S. is less about shipping costs and more about the advantages of\ngeographic proximity to the scientific and engineering expertise that is essential to managing and\nadvancing innovative production processes. The common feature, however, is that employers at\nthese new manufacturing operations are looking for skills that are a step above those of the\ntypical textile or furniture worker.\nEventually, these new jobs may leave too, as wages rise in the South, production processes\nbecome more standardized, and manufacturers find less expensive locations for their plants\nabroad (much like that of the textile and apparel industries). But we should view this as a\ncontinuous process of simultaneous gains and losses, with opportunities opening up requiring\nhigher skills as low-skill jobs are lost. Over time, the average skill of the workforce rises, and\nincomes increase commensurately. Two key necessities for continuing this process are the\napplication of more physical capital, including equipment and software, and improvements in\nhuman capital ─ the knowledge, aptitude and skills of workers.\n\n3\n\n\fManufacturing: Its Influence on Future Economic Policy\nAs I mentioned earlier, this last recession was severe across industries and regions, and the\nrecovery to date has been tepid at best. The South has been no exception. Indeed, during the\ncontraction in employment from the end of 2007 through early 2010, total nonfarm employment\nin the South declined by 7 percent. In manufacturing, which is notoriously more cyclical than\nmost other industries, employment fell 16-½ percent over the same period. Moreover, the\nregion’s employment declines were actually worse than the nation’s as a whole: Total U.S.\nemployment declined 5-¾ percent and manufacturing employment declined 15-½ percent. In\nfact, there is a tendency for states with the highest concentration of manufacturing to also have\nexperienced the deepest declines in total employment during the recession.\nAs is often the case, however, the deeper the decline, the stronger the recovery, and that has been\ntrue for virtually every state in the South over this business cycle. Most Southern states have\nbeen adding jobs more rapidly than the rest of the country, both in manufacturing and overall.\nThe recovery is still relatively young and the story is not over yet, but the data thus far suggest\nthat the secular shift in manufacturing activity to the South continues.\nDifferences across states in the severity of the recession also have meant differences in the\nseverity of the fiscal strains that state and local governments have experienced. From this point\nof view, manufacturing might appear to be a double-edged sword ─ it may mean good jobs, but\nalso more volatile employment and income. The fact that manufacturing has declined over time,\nboth as a share of employment and as a share of gross state product, has meant that its\ncontribution to changes over the cycle has diminished over time. On the other hand, the\ncomposition of manufacturing in the South has shifted toward more cyclical sensitivity. A broad\nfact is that consumption expenditures tend to be significantly more stable than investment\nexpenditures, including spending on durable consumer goods such as automobiles. Indeed,\nvirtually all of the states in the South that are associated with the expansion of the region’s\nautomotive industry (Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky) experienced\nsignificantly more severe declines in both total and manufacturing employment than the nation\nas a whole. Thus the shift toward production of autos and capital goods is going to increase the\ncyclical sensitivity of state and local finances.\nAs always, one should be alert to the possibility that this recovery may turn out to be\nqualitatively different from other recoveries. One striking observation that may be relevant to the\npossibility that growth underperforms for a sustained period is the apparent reluctance of many\nemployers to add workers in the face of rising demand. As we talk with manufacturers across the\nRichmond Fed’s District, we are hearing again and again that manufacturers are determined to\nkeep their head count down as much as possible, whether through increasing productivity or\nextending hours or just working harder. Even where manufacturers are seeing increasing orders,\ntheir uncertainty about the strength and sustainability of this recovery as well as the future\nregulatory and tax environment appears to be holding them back from hiring.\nAs an aside, I should take a minute to talk about the effect of global trade on the South. In my\nview, the South is a major beneficiary of globalization. Economists are always touting the\nadvantages of free trade ─ and admittedly there will be winners and losers in the process. When\nSouthern manufacturers were concentrated in low-skill industries like textiles and apparel, their\n4\n\n\fsupport for free trade was limited by the perception that import competition would erode their\ncomparative advantage. But the new industries of the South, like autos, aerospace and\npharmaceuticals, are exporting around the world. The South is also a heavy exporter of basic\ncommodities, such as coal and agricultural products, and our ports are now jammed with these\ngoods headed to all parts of the world. Demand for these products has benefitted from the rapid\ngrowth in emerging markets that I discussed earlier. Certainly global competition has eaten into\ndemand for low-skill manufactured goods like textiles and furniture, but the benefits of open\nglobal trade for higher-skill, higher-wage industries remain quite positive for the South.\nLooking past this recovery, prospects for manufacturing in the South look promising. The\ntransition to modern industrial growth in emerging markets is far from complete, so the demand\nfor our more advanced manufactured goods is likely to continue for some time. Opportunities\nshould continue to emerge to reduce costs and improve business processes through new capital\noutlays. Growth is likely in industries where the value of proximity to U.S. markets outweighs\nany wage cost disadvantage, such as the auto and auto supply sector. In addition, it makes sense\nto look for growth in areas where proximity to a critical mass of scientific and engineering knowhow is important. Manufacturing growth is likely to be relatively capital-intensive and require\nworkers with different skills than those displaced by the movement of low-skill jobs overseas.\nEconomic Vitality Depends on Skilled Workers\nWhat can policymakers take away from these perspectives on manufacturing in the South? The\nparamount importance of human capital is a commonplace formula, but one worth repeating\nnonetheless. Over time, our ability to sustain a comparative advantage in relatively more skillintensive manufacturing will depend critically on our ability to create and learn new skills. But\nthe wide variety of skills that people bring to bear on production and investment processes\nsuggests that policymakers pay close attention to the precise type of human capital investments\nthat will add the most value. The advanced research conducted in universities and other research\norganizations plays an essential role in the process of developing new technologies and applying\nthem. But often, substantial further work is required to translate the pure science generated in\nsuch settings into usable industrial applications. Moreover, innovative manufacturing processes\noften require new skills in the workers responsible for operating those processes.\nThe presumption often is that greater investment in formal education, higher education in\nparticular, is the best way for people to enhance human capital. This is certainly true up to a\npoint; higher education provides the opportunity to build the general skills of judgment that are\napplicable in a wide range of job settings. But it is also the case that more specialized, vocational\ntraining can build skills that are valuable in modern manufacturing. The broad emphasis on\nformal higher education thus can obscure recognition of the value of more targeted approaches to\nhuman capital.\nI’d like to note one further observation. In planning public sector investments in human capital,\npolicymakers should strive for balance across investments that pay off in the short run and those\nbenefits that accrue over the longer term. For example, investment in early childhood education\nis an area where research suggests substantial social returns over several decades.\n\n5\n\n\fThe final thought I will leave you with is that, while the South is a place, its future lies in its\npeople. The ability to sustain a vibrant manufacturing sector and reap the benefits it provides for\na thriving economy depends on the investments we can foster in the people of the South.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this speech.\nSee, for instance, Hornstein, Krusell and Violante, “The Effects of Technical Change on Labor Market\nInequalities,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Working Paper No. 04-8, December 2004.\n3\nFor all of these statistics, “the South” consists of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,\nNorth and South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.\n2\n\n6\n\n\f",

            "content": "Economic Outlook, May 2011\nMay 10, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nNorthern Virginia Regional Forum\nHyatt Regency Crystal City\nArlington, Virginia\n\nIt’s a pleasure to speak to you today about the outlook for the economy and economic policy. It\nwas nearly two years ago, in the spring of 2009, that the U.S. economy hit bottom, and though\nour economy has recovered since then, the pace of expansion has been disappointingly slow.\nUnemployment remains high, and many sectors of the economy remain in the doldrums. While I\ndon’t want to minimize the extent of lingering weakness in economic activity, we should not lose\nsight of the fact that the economy has been expanding at a significant pace and the fundamentals\nfor future growth are strong right now. Before we look at the economic outlook in more detail, I\nwould like to emphasize that these remarks are my own and the views expressed are not\nnecessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nLet me set the stage by reviewing how we got here. In 2008 and through the first half of 2009,\nwe experienced the worst recession since the Great Depression. We saw growth turn positive\nagain in July 2009. Our best measure of overall economic activity, gross domestic product or\nGDP, increased at a modest 2.8 percent annual rate over the next seven quarters. Many observers\nhave been disappointed with this modest growth, which was barely above the long-run trend rate\nthat results from population growth and productivity growth. But at least real GDP has\nimproved, and its level is now above its previous peak in the fourth quarter of 2007. Other\nimportant indicators of growth have not recovered. The number of employees on nonfarm\npayrolls has risen by 1.8 million persons in the last 14 months, but that increase is dwarfed by the\n8.7 million jobs that were lost in the previous two years. It’s fair to say that we have a way to go\nbefore we make up all of the ground lost during what many are calling the Great Recession.\nThe disappointing nature of this recovery can be seen in comparison to the recoveries from the\nother two deep recessions in the postwar period, the recessions of 1981-82 and 1974-75. In the\nfirst seven quarters after those recessions ended, real GDP growth averaged a 5.9 percent annual\nrate – twice as fast as the current recovery. Accompanying that output growth, job growth\naveraged 4.5 million persons in those two recoveries.\nTwo factors account for much of the sluggishness of this first stage of the recovery. The most\nobvious is the collapse of housing construction. We built too many houses in the boom years\n1\n\n\ffrom 1995 to 2005. Many of those houses are now vacant and make pretty good substitutes for\nnew construction. As a consequence, residential investment fell by 57 percent from the end of\nthe housing boom to the end of the recession, and has fallen further in this recovery. In contrast,\nresidential investment increased an average of 40 percent in the first year of recovery following\nthe two recessions I mentioned earlier.\nWhile housing is the most obvious factor dampening this recovery, residential investment\naccounts for only 2.2 percent of GDP at this point, down from 6.3 percent of the economy at the\npeak in 2005. A much larger factor is consumer spending, which accounts for over 70 percent of\nGDP. In the first year of this recovery, consumer expenditures increased less than 2 percent. This\nis in contrast to the two other recessions, where household spending grew by an average of 6-½\npercent in the first year of expansion.\nThus, a key to the outlook is consumer behavior. At over two-thirds of GDP, the recovery will\nnot be robust without sustained gains in consumer spending. And it is easy to understand why\nconsumers were cautious at the beginning of the recovery. A large number of households\nexperienced unemployment during the recession, and many more were uncertain about their job\nsecurity. On top of that, wage growth fell during the recession. The decline in housing prices,\nwhich was unusually large in this downturn, significantly reduced the value of housing equity on\nthe consumer balance sheet. In addition, stock prices declined sharply during the recession.\nConsumers responded to the drop in their net worth and current income the way they typically\ndo, by deferring nonessential spending and rebuilding their balance sheets.\nThe fundamentals underlying household spending plans have improved significantly since the\nrecession’s end. Most importantly, a number of indicators make it increasingly clear that the\nlabor market is headed in the right direction. The unemployment rate has fallen by over 1\npercentage point from its peak, and employers have added an average of 232,000 jobs per month\non net over the last three months. Household balances sheets are looking better as well, on the\nwhole. The stock market has more than doubled from its recession low point, and the net worth\nof households has increased by $8 trillion since early 2009. And even though home prices have\nbeen fluctuating lately, they are no longer in a virtual free fall as they were in 2008. As these\nfundamentals have improved, so has consumer spending. Retail sales rose 5.2 percent in the first\nyear of recovery, and in the next nine months improved at a 10 percent annualized growth rate.\nBecause this expansion is solidly grounded in improving fundamentals, I expect robust growth in\nconsumer spending to persist, as households see continuing improvements in job markets,\nincomes and wealth.\nWhile consumers are critical to the recovery, there are other sources of strength as well. Exports\nof goods and services have risen nearly 20 percent since the end of the recession, adding 2.2\npercent to real GDP growth. The key fundamental factor for export demand is growth abroad,\nand here the prospects are excellent. Although growth in the highly industrialized economies has\nbeen similar to our growth, many less developed economies are growing very rapidly. Especially\nnotable are the two most populous countries; China’s GDP grew 9.7 percent last year and India’s\nGDP grew 8.3 percent. Such exceptional growth is driven mainly by the rapid movement of large\nwork forces from pre-industrial sectors into enterprises that use up-to-date capital goods, a\nprocess that generates sizable productivity gains for workers making the transition. Japan’s\n2\n\n\fgrowth miracle following World War II was similarly propelled, and lasted for several decades,\nsuggesting that the current crop of rapidly growing economies can look forward to several\ndecades on the fast track. So I believe that export demand is likely to contribute strongly to U.S.\ngrowth for the foreseeable future.\nBusiness expansion also should make a significant contribution to growth this year. Investment\nin equipment and software has grown over 25 percent since the end of the recession, despite the\nmoderate rate of growth in demand. Opportunities to streamline business processes and reduce\ncosts through productivity-enhancing investments appear to be widespread. And as demand\ngrowth picks up, it will provide yet further encouragement for capital spending plans. All told\nthen, the economy has a lot going for it.\nAt the same time, there are still substantial challenges ahead. Housing activity remains\ndepressed. Given the extraordinarily large inventory of vacant homes and the ongoing wave of\nforeclosures, home prices are likely to remain under pressure, and the best case for residential\nconstruction would be a slow, uneven advance.\nAnother challenge stems from the recent run up in energy prices. The world price of crude oil\nhas risen more than 60 percent since last summer, and the economy is facing large increases in\nthe prices of gasoline and other petroleum products. Consumer spending growth is likely to be\nsomewhat restrained for a time, as households adjust to the bigger bite these higher prices take\nout of their take-home pay. I would be concerned if I expected substantial further price increases,\nbut at this point, futures markets are pricing in modest declines in petroleum products. If the\nmarkets are right about that, the effect of energy prices on consumer spending should only be\ntemporary. Having said that, our experience over much of the last decade demonstrates that a flat\nfutures curve does not preclude further price hikes.\nA longer-run challenge is fiscal policy. The trajectories of federal government spending and\ntaxes have diverged, leaving us with a budget deficit that was above 10 percent of GDP last year.\nThe amount of government debt therefore is rising more rapidly than GDP, with no relief in sight\nunder current legislation. Of course, the national debt cannot grow faster than our ability to repay\nforever. That is simply not feasible and will not happen. The real question is whether our elected\nofficials make timely adjustments to the paths of spending and taxes, or whether a crisis forces\nhasty decisions. The array of efforts underway, just over the Potomac, to address our fiscal\nchallenge is encouraging. But until credible changes are made to align spending and taxes, an\noverhang of uncertainty will make long-term planning more difficult for households and firms.\nDespite these challenges, most forecasters predict that overall economic activity will grow over\nthe next few years at a solidly above-trend pace; emerging market growth and innovation\nopportunities continue to drive business demand and spending, and consumers continue to regain\nconfidence in their future income prospects. Under that forecast, unemployment would continue\nto decline and income growth would improve. I would sign on to that projection, although as\nalways, actual outcomes may lie either above or below that forecast. It also is worth emphasizing\nthat the rate of growth may well fluctuate from quarter to quarter around that projected trend, and\nwe should be careful not to read too much into every month’s little data jiggle.\n\n3\n\n\fOne reason that the consensus of forecasters is so positive about the national economy is that\nthey believe that the inflation environment will remain benign. Granted, inflation has surged to\nmore than a 4 percent rate over the last few months in response to large upswings in energy and\ncommodity prices. But there are good reasons to believe this surge is temporary. The prices of\nenergy futures indicate that market participants generally expect spot prices to decline gradually\nover time going forward. In addition, surveys and financial market prices indicate that market\nparticipants generally expect overall inflation to decline this year. So in the absence of further\nenergy price increases, we are likely to see inflation subside to a rate closer to 1-½ percent.\nWe should not take that outcome for granted, however. Input price increases have squeezed\nprofit margins for many firms, and we are increasingly hearing that some are looking for an\nopportunity to raise prices. If firms see robust demand growth, they will be increasingly willing\nto pass input price increases through to their customers. Such increases can be common in this\nstage of the business cycle. In late 2003 and early 2004, for example, non-food non-energy\ninflation ratcheted up rapidly to over 2 percent, and overall inflation averaged 3 percent over the\nfollowing four years. This may not have been the worst of all possible outcomes, but I do not\nconsider it a success. With the pace of expansion clearly picking up now, we should strive to do\na better job this time of preventing an excessive rise in inflation.\nThe responsibility of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is to conduct monetary\npolicy in a manner that confirms expectations that inflation will remain low over time. Next\nmonth the FOMC will complete the $600 billion asset purchase program announced last\nNovember. Barring significant unexpected developments, this should be the high-water mark for\nmonetary stimulus in this cycle, with the focus going forward on the timing and pace of stimulus\nwithdrawal. While timing and pace will depend upon how the economy behaves, I believe it will\nbe important to remember the lesson of the last recovery – namely, that inflation is capable of\nrising even if the level of economic activity has not returned to its pre-recession trend. To\nprevent that, it may be necessary to initiate policy tightening well before the unemployment rate\nhas fallen to a rate we would expect to see over the long run.\nWhile our economy faces significant macroeconomic policy challenges, constructing a more\neffective regime of financial regulation may ultimately prove more difficult. In my view, the\ncrisis we just experienced resulted largely from a mismatch between a regulatory structure\ndesigned for the explicit financial safety net (consisting mainly of deposit insurance) and the\nextent of moral hazard induced by a much broader implicit safety net. Given precedents dating\nback to Continental Illinois in the 1980’s and beyond, market participants made inferences about\nwhat government protection might be forthcoming in future instances of financial distress – that\nis, which institutions were likely to be viewed by authorities as “too big to fail.” This lack of\nclarity about the federal safety net grew in the decades leading up to the crisis – and came about\nbecause policymakers hoped that a policy of “constructive ambiguity” would dampen the\nmarkets’ expectations of bailouts, but preserve their option to intervene if necessary. Researchers\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond have estimated, based on conservative assumptions,\nthat the federal financial safety net now covers 62 percent of the financial sector, compared to\nabout 45 percent a decade earlier.\n\n4\n\n\fLast year’s landmark financial reform legislation – the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act of 2010 – seeks to close the gap between the scope of prudential\nregulation and the scope of the implicit safety net. Dodd-Frank gives regulators new tools to\nconstrain private risk-taking, and seeks to limit the implicit safety net by empowering the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to liquidate troubled nonbank firms and by placing new\nconstraints on the Fed’s lending powers. But the FDIC and the Fed retain considerable discretion\nto use taxpayer funds to limit losses to some creditors. This creates continued uncertainty about\npossible rescues, as well as gaps in our ability to provide clear, credible constraints on the safety\nnet.\nIn the near term, I believe regulators have a firm grasp on the industry, and are taking strong\nsteps to tighten risk management at regulated firms. But firms will continue to have an incentive\nto by-pass regulation to take on excessive risks and still enjoy some degree of implicit protection.\nThis desire to operate just outside the perimeter of regulation, but within the implicit safety net,\nwill present ongoing supervisory and regulatory challenges – and may make it difficult to\nprevent or limit the magnitude of future crises. Ambiguity about the extent of federal financial\nsupport would make such by-pass virtually inevitable. Unless we establish clear expectations\nabout the federal financial safety net and live up to our commitment to limit government rescues,\nour financial system will continue to pose a significant risk to economic growth.\nIn conclusion, let me say that we’ve come through an extraordinary period in our nation’s\nhistory. Despite all the challenges, there are good reasons for an affirmative view of the future,\nas long as policymakers follow coherent, sustainable, long-term policy plans. I look forward to\nworking with my colleagues in the Federal Reserve to meet the unique policy challenges we face\nin the years ahead.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for assistance in preparing this speech.\n\n5\n\n\f",

            "content": "Economic Outlook, April 2011\nApril 14, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nMerrick School of Business\nUniversity of Baltimore\nBaltimore, Md.\nIt’s a pleasure to speak on the economy today. Like many of you, I almost dread picking up a\nnewspaper in the morning and seeing headlines about natural disasters and new outbreaks of\nfighting around the world. And even when the subject is the economy, the news is full of risks,\nsurging oil prices and a broken Federal budget. I don’t want to minimize these risks, which are\nreal. But I also don’t want to lose sight of an economy that is firmly in recovery mode, and the\nfundamentals for future growth are strong. Before we look at the economic outlook in more\ndetail, I would like to emphasize that these remarks are my own and the views expressed are not\nnecessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nLet me begin by setting the stage. In 2008 and through the first half of 2009, we experienced the\nworst recession since the Great Depression. We saw growth turn positive again in July 2009. Our\nbest measure of overall economic activity, gross domestic product or GDP, increased at a modest\n2.9 percent annual rate over the next six quarters. Many observers were disappointed with that\nmodest growth, which was barely above the long-run trend rate that results from population\ngrowth and productivity growth. But at least real GDP has improved, since its level is now above\nits previous peak in the fourth quarter of 2007. Other important indicators of growth have not\nrecovered. The number of employees on nonfarm payrolls has risen by 1.4 million persons in the\nlast 15 months, but that increase is dwarfed by the 8.7 million jobs that were lost in the previous\ntwo years. It’s fair to say that we have a ways to go before we will fully recover from what many\nare calling the Great Recession.\nA natural question is whether growth could be stronger. After all, we can remember other times\nwhen the recovery from a recession was much more rapid than this current recovery. Consider\nthe recoveries from the other two deep recessions in the postwar period, the recessions of 198182 and 1974-75. In the first six quarters after those recessions ended, real GDP growth averaged\na 6.3 percent annual rate. Accompanying that output growth, job growth averaged 4.5 million\npersons in those two recoveries.\nTwo factors account for much of the sluggishness of this first stage of the recovery. The most\nobvious is the collapse of housing construction. We built too many houses in the boom years\nfrom 1995 to 2005, and many of those houses are now vacant and are pretty good substitutes for\nnew construction. As a consequence, residential investment fell by 57 percent from the end of\nthe housing boom to the end of the recession, and has fallen further in this recovery. In contrast,\n1\n\n\fresidential investment increased an average of 40 percent in the first year of recovery following\nthe two recessions I mentioned earlier.\nWhile housing is the most obvious factor dampening this recovery, residential investment\naccounts for only 2.4 percent of GDP at this point. A much larger factor is consumer spending,\nwhich accounts for over 70 percent of GDP. In the first five quarters of this recovery, consumer\nexpenditures increased at an annual rate just below 2 percent. This is in contrast to the two other\nrecessions, where household spending grew by an average of 6-½ percent in the first year of\nexpansion.\nThus a key to the outlook is consumer behavior. At over two-thirds of GDP, it is impossible to\nimagine a robust recovery without a substantial advance in consumer spending. And it is easy to\nunderstand why consumers were cautious at the beginning of the recovery. A large number of\nhouseholds experienced unemployment during the recession, and many more were uncertain\nabout their job security. Wage growth fell during the recession. Housing prices declined, in many\ncases unexpectedly, significantly reducing the value of housing equity on the consumer balance\nsheet. Stock prices declined sharply during the recession. It should not be too surprising that\nconsumers responded to this adversity by deferring nonessential spending and rebuilding their\nbalance sheets. That behavior is reflected in statistics such as personal saving, which was slightly\nbelow 2 percent of income in mid-2007 but was slightly above 6 percent of income at the end of\nthe recession.\nSome important fundamentals underlying household spending plans have improved significantly\nsince the recession’s end. New claims for unemployment insurance have trended down since last\nsummer. The unemployment rate has fallen by 1.3 percentage points from its peak, and as a\nresult, those who are employed have reason to be more confident in their job security.\nEmployment has picked up, with growth in the last two months averaging slightly better than\n200,000 jobs per month. The employment components of the Institute for Supply Management’s\nmonthly surveys of manufacturing and nonmanufacturing activity are at extremely high levels,\nsignaling broad gains in labor market conditions. The stock market has more than doubled from\nits recession low point, and the net worth of households has increased by $8 trillion since early\n2009. As these fundamentals have improved, so has consumer spending. Retail sales rose 5.2\npercent in the first year of recovery, and in the next nine months improved at a 9.9 percent\nannualized growth rate.\nI would stress that this higher pace of consumer spending is solidly grounded in improving\nfundamentals. Thus I expect robust growth to persist, as consumers see continuing improvements\nin job markets, incomes and wealth. Moreover, households have deferred nonessential spending\nfor several years and a stock of pent-up demand has built up; as they gain confidence, it is likely\nthey will draw down that stock and boost spending as a result.\nThus I see consumer spending as an important part of the recovery, but there are other areas of\nstrength as well. Exports of goods and services have risen 18 percent since the end of the\nrecession, adding 2 percent to real GDP growth. Yes, exports fell in February, as reported\nyesterday by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, but they remain well ahead of the fourth\nquarter’s pace. Moreover, the key fundamental factor for export demand is growth abroad, and\n2\n\n\fhere the prospects are excellent. Although growth in the highly industrialized economies has\nbeen similar to domestic growth, many less developed economies are growing very rapidly.\nEspecially notable are the two most populous countries; China’s GDP grew 9.7 percent last year\nand India’s GDP grew 8.3 percent. Again, this growth is solidly based, as these countries are\ndeploying a large labor base more effectively. Japan’s growth miracle following World War II\nlasted for several decades, and the current crop of rapidly growing economies can look forward\nto several decades on the fast track. As they grow, they will buy more of our products.\nConsumers who join their middle class will buy goods we make that were formerly luxuries,\nfrom pharmaceuticals to motion pictures. Demand for our agricultural products will rise. Most\nimportantly, newly industrializing economies will want to acquire more capital goods in order to\nallow workers to move into more productive activities. For all of these reasons, export demand is\nlikely to contribute strongly to U.S. growth for the foreseeable future as we produce goods and\nservices that the world wants to buy, especially the most rapidly growing parts of the world.\nBusiness expansion also should make a significant contribution to growth this year. Investment\nin equipment and software has grown 22 percent since the end of the recession. Opportunities to\nstreamline business processes and reduce costs through productivity-enhancing investments\nappear to be widespread. The pickup in demand growth also is providing further encouragement\nfor capital spending plans. All told, the economy has a lot going for it.\nAt the same time, there are still substantial challenges ahead. Housing activity remains\ndepressed. Given the large inventory of vacant homes and the ongoing foreclosure wave, home\nprices are likely to remain under pressure, and the best case for residential construction would be\na slow, uneven advance.\nAnother challenge comes from the recent run up in energy prices. The world price of crude oil\nhas risen more than 60 percent since last summer, and the economy is facing large increases in\nthe prices of gasoline and other petroleum products. Consumer spending growth is likely to be\nsomewhat restrained for a time as households adjust to these higher prices. I would be concerned\nif I expected further price increases. But at this juncture, futures markets are pricing in modest\ndeclines in petroleum products. If the markets are right, the effect of energy prices on consumer\nspending should only be temporary.\nA longer-run challenge is fiscal policy. The trajectories of federal government spending and\ntaxes have diverged, leaving us with a budget deficit that was above 10 percent of GDP last year.\nThe amount of government borrowing is therefore rising more rapidly than GDP, with no relief\nin sight under current legislation. Of course, borrowing cannot grow faster than our ability to\nrepay forever. That is simply not feasible and most definitely will not happen. The real question\nis whether our elected officials make timely adjustments to the paths of spending and taxes, or\nwhether a crisis forces hasty decisions. Until credible changes are made to align spending and\ntaxes, an overhang of uncertainty will make long-term planning more difficult for households\nand firms.\nDespite these challenges, most forecasters predict that overall economic activity will grow at a\npace that is well above trend for the next few years, and I would sign on to that forecast. Under\nthat forecast, unemployment would continue to decline and income growth would improve.\n3\n\n\fThe improvement in U.S. economic activity will translate into a continued strengthening of the\nMaryland economy. As a result of its diverse private sector, strong education and health sectors,\nand hefty federal spending within the state, the Maryland economy fared better than the national\neconomy during the recession. This assessment includes Maryland’s labor markets, where the\nunemployment rate, though still elevated, is well below the national average at 7.1 percent, and\npayroll employment has grown by 1.8 percent over the past 12 months. The same is true of the\nBaltimore metropolitan area, where hiring also has increased. As a result of the improving labor\nmarket, wage and salary growth has rebounded, which has helped support consumer spending.\nFor example, in 2010, new car sales in Maryland increased for the first time since prior to the\nrecession. Over the next several years, the state’s economy should benefit from the Base\nRealignments at Aberdeen Proving Ground and Fort Meade, which will bring new residents and\ndemand for ancillary services. The presence of an array of strong research institutions,\nparticularly in the life sciences, should also contribute to the economic vitality of the state.\nMaryland is home to more than 400 life-science businesses, one of the largest life science\nclusters in the nation. It has demonstrated the capability of world-class scientific research to\ngenerate the type of innovations that lead to start-up firms and job creation. Abundant evidence\nsuggests that such innovation is the foundation for long-run growth in any economy.\nOne reason that the consensus of forecasters is so positive about the national economy is that\nthey believe that the inflation environment will remain benign. Over the 12 months ending in\nFebruary, the price index for personal consumption expenditure has risen 1.6 percent. In the\nabsence of further energy price increases most forecasters do not foresee a significant\nacceleration in prices this year. We should not take that outcome for granted, however.\nCommodity price increases have squeezed profit margins for many firms, and we are\nincreasingly hearing that some are looking for an opportunity to raise prices. If firms see robust\ndemand growth, they will be increasingly willing to pass input price increases through to their\ncustomers. Such increases can be common in this stage of the business cycle.\nBusinesses thus far have absorbed input price increases, presumably believing that competitors\nwould not follow suit, which suggests that they believe that overall inflation will remain low.\nThe responsibility of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is to validate these\nexpectations by conducting monetary policy in such a way that inflation does not accelerate.\nThat’s not always an easy task at this point in a recovery. In the last cycle, the economy began to\ngrow more rapidly at the end of 2003. Although energy prices showed growth spurts,\nunemployment had not yet begun to fall and the core inflation measure that excludes energy and\nfood prices was still just 1-½ percent. As a result, many forecasters expected inflation to\ndiminish, and the FOMC kept the funds rate at a very low level well into 2004. Instead of falling,\noverall inflation soon rose to 3 percent, where it stayed, on average, through the end of the\nexpansion in 2007. Core inflation averaged 2-¼ percent over that horizon. With hindsight, I think\nit is fair to say that policymakers overestimated the extent to which high unemployment would\nkeep inflation from accelerating, and as a result, waited too long to withdraw monetary stimulus.\nFour years of 3 percent inflation may not have been the worst of all possible outcomes, but I do\nnot consider it a success. I hope we do better this time. In particular, I believe we need to heed\nthe lesson of the last recovery that inflation is capable of rising even if the level of economic\nactivity has not returned to its pre-recession trend.\n4\n\n\fIn conclusion, let me say that we’ve come through an extraordinary period in our nation’s\nhistory. Despite all the challenges, there are good reasons for an affirmative view of the future,\nas long as policymakers follow coherent, sustainable long-term policy plans. I look forward to\nworking with my colleagues in the Federal Reserve to meet the unique monetary policy\nchallenges we face this year.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and Andy Bauer for assistance in preparing this speech.\n\n5\n\n\f",

            "content": "Innovation in the New Financial Regulatory Environment\nApril 7, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n2011 Ferrum College Forum on Critical Thought, Innovation & Leadership\nRoanoke, Va.\n\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss a topic – financial innovation – that I think is of\ngreat importance as we learn more about what caused the financial crisis and shape the\nfuture of financial regulation. Currently, many people are hostile to the very thought of\nfinancial innovation. After all, wasn’t it new financial products and instruments –\nsubprime mortgages and complex derivatives, for example – that got us into trouble in\nthe first place? The answer here, as with many things in economics, is yes and no. In my\nview, the question is not whether financial innovation is inherently good or bad. Instead,\nwe should think about whether or not particular financial innovations are improving\npeople’s wellbeing. And that, I think, is largely dependent upon the structure of the\nregulations and policies under which financial firms operate.\nInnovations in financial arrangements, like innovations in any sector, are shaped by the\nincentives that firms face. In many cases, those incentives align the interests of\ninnovators with those of society as a whole. New goods or services, or new ways of\norganizing production, are often profitable only to the extent that they provide something\nthat consumers value, or reduce the real costs of production. Indeed, this is why the\ninnovations that have been the engine of economic growth for the last several centuries\nhave resulted in such profound improvements in wellbeing.\nThe financial world is heavily regulated, however, and as a result, incentives are heavily\ninfluenced by the regulatory policy regime. In many instances, financial innovation is\naimed at “regulatory bypass,” where firms adapt to the rules they face and create\ninstruments to effectively work around those constraints. Some cases of regulatory\nbypass, as I will discuss, have had beneficial effects. Some have had negative effects.\nAnd some have had both.\nOne of the most conspicuous features of the environment faced by the financial market\nparticipants is the presence of the federal financial safety net – that is, the explicit and\nimplied commitments to rescue creditors of distressed financial firms in order to limit\nwhat is called “financial instability.” This safety net often influences the direction of\nfinancial innovation. Firms that benefit from a government backstop are willing to forgo\ncostly measures to protect themselves against runs or liquidity pressures that would elicit\ngovernment protection, just as property owners overinvest in flood plains knowing that\nthey will be reimbursed in the event of a disaster. The precedents set in the recent\nfinancial crisis extended government support more broadly than before, and thus have\n1\n\n\fdramatically expanded the implicit safety net – to nearly two-thirds of the financial sector\naccording to some estimates. Ideally, the extent of implied government support would be\nmatched by the scope of prudential regulation to contain the moral hazard that would\notherwise encourage excessive risk taking. That was not the case leading up to this crisis,\nand it is not clear that recent reforms have succeeded at closing the gap or limiting the\nsafety net. As a result, I believe there is a substantial risk that much future financial\ninnovation will be directed at by-passing regulations and exploiting the safety net, rather\nthan improving people’s wellbeing. Before I begin, I should note that the views expressed\ntoday are my own and do not represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.1\nFinancial Innovation as Regulatory Bypass\nThere are some innovations in the broader economy that I would agree have greatly\nbenefited society. One example, which is particularly salient here in Roanoke, is the\ndevelopment of railroads to move commercial goods long distances. Railroads were less\ncostly and more efficient than previous modes of transport and made our country’s\neconomy much less regional. This was an innovation that led to significant gains for most\npeople. Firms have since found other ways to move goods cross-country, such as largescale trucking, for example. But both the development of the rail system and,\nsubsequently, commercial trucking are examples of innovations that were not driven by a\ndesire to bypass regulations. They simply met the needs of an industrializing nation.\nSimilar examples occur in the financial sector. One involves the use of advances in\ncomputing and communication technologies to improve the rating of risks associated\nwith potential borrowers.2 This was a particularly powerful force in the evolution of the\nmarket for unsecured consumer credit from the 1980s on. It allowed lenders to make finer\ndistinctions among borrowers, which in turn allowed lenders to extend credit profitably at\nlower spreads to some consumers. For example, virtually all credit cards charged a single\nrate near 20 percent in the early 1980s, but improvements in underwriting allowed\nlenders to charge lower rates to less-risky consumers, and to find creditworthy borrowers\namong the group of consumers that were formerly unable to qualify for credit at all. The\ngreatly expanded access to credit gave households greater flexibility in managing their\nhousehold finances, adjusting to temporary financial shocks, such as unexpected car\nrepair or medical expenses, and in accumulating durable goods. The expansion of access\nto unsecured credit also brought along with it an increase in the frequency of adverse\noutcomes for households, in which they run up high debt burdens, and perhaps default on\npayment obligations. I believe the evidence is fairly strong, however, that the net effect\nhas been beneficial for consumers.3\nThere are other examples where regulations did play a significant role in financial\ninnovation. Consider the development of money market mutual funds (“money funds” for\nshort), which invest in short term commercial paper and Treasury securities and provide\ninvestors with daily access to their funds. Money funds provide a close substitute for\nbank deposits, but circumvent the prohibition of interest on demand deposits held by\n\n2\n\n\fcorporations.4 This was a clear case of financial innovation driven by regulation – and\none that brought clear benefits to investors, including many consumers.\nMoney market mutual funds were also a source of instability during the recent financial\ncrisis, however. When Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, their commercial paper\nbecame locked up in bankruptcy court and the market value of commercial paper issued\nby other financial institutions fell. One MMMF was forced to “break the buck” because\nits underlying valuations moved too far below $1. This led to a “run” by institutional\ninvestors on money funds that held commercial paper to avoid being stuck with capital\nlosses. (As an aside, a Securities and Exchange Commission rule actually enhances\ninvestors’ incentives to run money funds if they expect capital losses.) Policymakers then\nintervened with an insurance program for pre-existing balances in money funds and\nFederal Reserve lending programs to support commercial paper prices. It was not clear,\nprior to the crisis, that these firms were inside the financial safety net – yet many fund\nmanagers and investors may have perceived that to be the case, given historic episodes\nsuch as the collapse of Penn Central, during which the Federal Reserve provided extra\nliquidity to support these markets.5 The precedents set by intervention during this most\nrecent crisis led to a significant increase in the scope of the safety net.6\nPrior to the crisis, policymakers pursued a strategy of “constructive ambiguity” about the\nboundaries of the safety net. The belief was that such a strategy would lead firms to\nbelieve they might not receive safety net support, but would allow policymakers to\npreserve the option to bail out institutions, if they deemed it necessary. Instead of\nreducing expectations about the likelihood of bailouts, constructive ambiguity, as I\nargued recently in congressional testimony, did exactly the opposite. Policymakers tend\nto rescue the creditors of failing financial firms more often than they would have those\ncreditors believe, with the inevitable result that market expectations about the likelihood\nof bailouts increased.7\nThe ultimate result of constructive ambiguity was that the implicit safety net grew to\ninclude much of the so-called “shadow banking” system, which I will discuss shortly.\nResearchers at the Richmond Fed have estimated that at the end of 2009, the implicit\nsafety net covered as much as 40 percent of all financial sector liabilities. When\ncombined with explicit protection for depository institutions and some other firms, the\noverall federal financial safety net covered 62 percent of the financial sector, up from an\nearlier estimate of 45 percent in 1999.8\nOverall, then, I think it is fair to say that the policy of constructive ambiguity has failed.\nIf we learn one thing about the financial crisis, it should be that we must establish a\ncredible commitment regarding which assets will benefit from the government safety net\nand which do not; otherwise, the boundaries of the safety net will continually expand.\nEstablishing such credibility is going to be a challenge. It may require policymakers to let\nan institution fail even if creditors believe that it is implicitly guaranteed. Doing so, to be\nsure, could cause some short-run disruptions to the financial sector as investor\nexpectations revise their expectations about future intervention. But in the long run,\n\n3\n\n\festablishing credibility about which firms are going to receive protection and which are\nnot will be key to avoiding the type of financial instability that we observed in 2008.\nIt should be fairly obvious that financial firms whose creditors benefit from the prospect\nof official support should be subject to prudential regulation in order to contain the moral\nhazard that arises in the presence of such third-party guarantees. The critical weakness of\nan ambiguous safety net is the mismatch between regulation and safety net scope. Some\nfirms will benefit from support but not be subject to prudential regulation to prevent\nexcessive risk taking. The mismatch problem could conceivably be resolved by\nexpanding prudential regulation until it encompasses all institutions that policymakers\nmight want to support. Regulation is not foolproof, however, and what’s more, it imposes\nsignificant burdens of its own. While these burdens are difficult to quantify, I find it hard\nto believe that the most appropriate size of the government financial safety net is\nanything close to nearly two-thirds of the financial sector.\nShadow Banking Sector\nThe mismatch associated with an ambiguous financial safety net provides a powerful\nimpetus to the growth of the so-called “shadow banking” sector over time. The term\nshadow banking refers to activities that resemble traditional banking, in that they involve\nmaturity transformation – that is, issuing very short term or demandable instruments,\nsuch as deposits, to fund longer-term or less-liquid assets. Such activities were often\nstructured so as to avoid regulations and capital requirements imposed on banks. Any\nfirm that performs maturity transformation, however, exposes itself to the risk of\nfinancial distress if their creditors lose confidence in their ability to repay and withdraw\ntheir funds, or refuse to roll over their investments. Creditor runs are exactly the kind of\nevents that typically elicit official support, because if no government support is\nforthcoming, the creditors of other similar firms are likely to run as well. Intervention in\nthe event of a run outside the banking system is attractive to policymakers because it can\nstabilize creditors’ expectations regarding future intervention. The precedents set by\nintervening outside the formal banking system thus provide a further stimulus to the\ngrowth of fragility-prone maturity transformation in the shadow banking system, beyond\nthe incentive to avoid the burden of prudential regulation. Measuring the size of the\nshadow banking system is difficult, but some have estimated that shadow banking\nliabilities exceeded $20 trillion at its peak, roughly twice as large as the traditional,\nregulated banking system.9\nAn instructive case in point is the market for repurchase agreements, often referred to as\n“repos.” A repo is essentially a short-term collateralized loan, structured as a purchase of\nthe collateral by the lender today, followed by a repurchase with interest by the borrower\nat a subsequent date (the maturity of the loan). A “haircut” is typically applied to provide\nthe lender with a buffer in case the borrower cannot repay the loan and the collateral is\nhard to sell. While many repos are often mature in just one day, they are typically rolled\nover. In the most common form of repo, settlement takes place on the books of one of the\ntwo government securities clearing banks, who lend money to borrowers each morning to\n\n4\n\n\fallow them to reacquire their collateral to use in trading during the day. The repo market\nis now about $2 trillion in size.\nThis type of transaction can have many benefits. Lenders are often institutional investors,\nmoney funds or corporations that are prohibited from earning interest on bank deposits;\nrepos provide them with an attractive rate of return on an investment that is as liquid as a\nbank deposit. Borrowers are able to finance a broad range of assets at much less cost than\nan equivalent amount of traditional debt or equity issuance. But repo financing exposes\nthe borrower to tremendous risks if lenders refuse to roll-over their repo positions and the\nborrower has a hard time selling their assets. This was the essence of the situation facing\nBear Stearns in the days leading up to JP Morgan Chase’s unwillingness to extend credit\nthe morning of March 14, 2008, to fund the return of collateral to Bear Stearns’ repo\nlenders. Without government support, the fear was that repo lenders also would pull back\nfrom other large investment banks out of a belief that they, too, were now less likely to\nreceive government support. Intervention stabilized markets by implying a commitment\nto intervene to prevent other investment banks from defaulting.\nAs with money funds, the repo market represents a financial innovation that escaped the\nregulatory burden imposed on traditional bank deposits. It is important to recognize,\nhowever, that the implicit safety net tilts the playing field toward such inherently fragile\narrangements.\nThe breakdown of the repo market in 2008 was due in large measure to the deterioration\nin the value of the collateral at weak firms – and much of that collateral was in the form\nof housing debt. This brings me to the next portion of my talk, which has to do with\ninnovation in home mortgage lending: Why did housing prices rise and drop so sharply,\nand what should we do to reform housing finance policy?\nToward a New Housing Finance Policy\nWhile there is need for continued research into the precise causes of the housing boom\nand bust that sparked the recent crisis, I believe a broad narrative is reasonably clear.\nFinancial institutions that benefited from implicit government guarantees – notably the\ngovernment-sponsored housing enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, plus several\nlarge U.S. and European banking institutions – fueled the demand for securities backed\nby risky subprime mortgages. These institutions were widely viewed by market\nparticipants as likely to benefit from government support in the event of financial\ndistress. The implied backstop led them, and their creditors, to underweight the risk of a\nbroad nationwide downturn in housing markets, since that would be most likely to elicit\nofficial support to protect creditors. Their biased risk preferences had the effect of\ndistorting the incentives of a broad range of other participants in the mortgage\ndistribution chain, from credit rating agencies to securitizers to originators to loan\nbrokers. The resulting oversupply of subprime mortgage lending increased the demand\nfor housing, which drove up home prices in regions like California and Florida, where the\nsupply of buildable lots was inelastic. The resulting price surge made subprime lending\nlook profitably for a time, because troubled borrowers could refinance using the rising\n5\n\n\fequity in their own home. When demand expansion reached natural limits, price\nappreciation slowed and then ceased, raising the cost of home ownership and increasing\ndefaults among overextended borrowers. The rest, as they say, is history.\nWhy did Fannie and Freddie guarantee so many loans that became troubled, ultimately\nresulting in those agencies being put into conservatorship? I have alluded to one very\nimportant reason: Those institutions were widely perceived, correctly as it turned out, as\nbeing inside the safety net. As a result, they had much less incentive to provide sufficient\nscrutiny when evaluating many of the loans they guaranteed or securities they purchased.\nOthers have argued that affordable housing mandates also encouraged Fannie and\nFreddie to acquire large amounts of securities backed by poorly-underwritten mortgage\nloans. Those mandates, I would argue, were a by-product of their perceived status as\ngovernment supported.\nFannie and Freddie, to a large extent, represented government-sponsored regulatory bypass. They were chartered explicitly to provide a secondary market for mortgages which\notherwise would have been held on the books of banks. As a result, the funding for those\nmortgages went around the banking system, and thus escaped the associated regulatory\nburden. In addition, the two GSEs have been especially active in making 30-year loans\nrequiring relatively small down payments. A nontrivial share of houses financed in that\nmanner eventually went into foreclosure or were put up for short-sale. It is worth noting\nthat the commonly held belief that the GSEs effectively invented the 30-year, low-down\npayment, no-prepayment penalty mortgage is incorrect. During the 1980s, private\nmortgage issuers began providing such loans.10 After Fannie and Freddie, with their\nimplicit government guarantee, got into that business on a large scale, the private market\nfor such loans dried up, as private issuers found it increasingly hard to compete with the\nterms provided by the GSEs. Thus the implicit safety net tilted the playing field\nsignificantly in favor of the GSEs.\nA consensus has emerged that Fannie and Freddie need to be wound down in some\nfashion. One way to do this would be to shut them down immediately. While this has\nsome appeal, I don’t think it is politically feasible, or economically desirable. Such an\napproach would require overly rapid adjustments in housing finance arrangements, as the\nhousing market is still coping with the aftermath of the bust. In February, the Department\nof Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a report to\nCongress outlining some ways to “wind down both institutions, creating the conditions\nfor private capital to play the predominant role in housing finance.”11 Among their\nproposals are: increase guarantee fees to bring in more private capital; increase private\ncapital ahead of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantees; reduce conforming loan limits;\nand wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s investment portfolio. As the agencies’\nreport states, Fannie and Freddie “were allowed to behave like government-backed hedge\nfunds, managing large investment portfolios for the profit of their shareholders with the\nrisk ultimately falling largely on taxpayers.” I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment,\nand I believe it was a mistake that must not be repeated.\n\n6\n\n\fThrough their various activities, all backed by implicit government support, Fannie and\nFreddie introduced distortions into the housing market and put the taxpayer on the hook\nfor billions of dollars. But as I have noted, they are not the only institutions that were\nculpable in the housing crisis. Many private sector financial institutions also took\nimprudent risks that contributed to the financial crisis. What these institutions had in\ncommon, however, is that they all enjoyed, or were thought to enjoy, the protection of the\nfederal financial safety net.\nWinding down Fannie and Freddie is a vital first step, in my view, but the more\ncontentious question concerns the future of housing finance policy. For decades, the\ngovernment has promoted homeownership by subsidizing debt, through both the\nunpriced, implied guarantees for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the home mortgage\ninterest deduction. That created an environment that accelerated innovations in the\nprovision and packaging of such debt but discouraged prudent safeguards against the risk\nof large shocks to housing markets. It should not be surprising, then, that we actually\nexperienced a large shock to housing finance markets that led to a broader crisis in\nfinancial markets, largely as a result of financial innovations that circumvented banking\nregulations and exploited the implicit safety net.\nOther countries have demonstrated ways in which the government can promote\nhomeownership by subsidizing equity instead, such as through tax-preferred treatment of\nsavings vehicles that can be used for down payments. More fundamentally, though, we\nought to rethink whether the government should be in the business of subsidizing\nhomeownership at all. It may be true that homeownership yields some positive\nexternalities. For instance, on the margin, homeowners probably do take better care of\ntheir dwellings and contribute more to civic vibrancy than non-homeowners. But it’s not\nclear how large those differences are, nor is it clear how much those differences are\nworth. We must remember that foreclosed properties bring externalities with them too,\nbut in such cases those externalities are negative. While buying a home is a desirable\noption for many households, renting may be as desirable for other households that prefer\ngreater financial and locational flexibility. Households should make that decision based\non their own particular circumstances, including, among other things, their expected\nearnings, the variability of those earnings over time and the value they place on mobility.\nPlacing Credible Boundaries on the Safety Net\nTo summarize then, financial innovations, like all innovations, can be either good or bad,\ndepending largely on the incentives facing potential innovators. Outside of the financial\nsystem, innovators’ incentives are generally aligned with the interests of consumers, the\nultimate beneficiaries of the invention process. The heavy regulation of the financial\nsystem can distort incentives, however, and lead to detrimental, rather than beneficial\ninnovation. Broadly speaking, the government’s role in financial markets involves two\nthings: provision of a safety net, both explicit and implicit, and prudential regulation to\ncounteract the moral hazard effect of such backstops. Financial stability requires a close\nmatch between the scope of the safety net and the scope of prudential regulation. When\nthere are gaps between the two, financial institutions have incentives to by-pass\n7\n\n\fregulation and structure their funding in ways that exploit safety net protection. The\nrecent financial crisis was caused by large gaps between the scope of prudential\nregulation and the scope of the safety net, which had grown to cover nearly half the\nfinancial sector because of the dynamics induced by safety net ambiguity. When the\nboundaries of the safety net are unclear, withholding support from a failing institution\nalways looks too risky. In the presence of such gaps, innovation was drawn toward bypassing regulation and increasing reliance on implicit government support. Safety net\nambiguity thus distorted financial innovation in a way that made the financial system\nmore risky and more prone to financial crises. Actions taken during the recent crisis have\nset precedents suggesting a dramatically expanded safety net – 62 percent of financial\nsector liabilities according to one conservative estimate.\nThis diagnosis implies that the first reform priority should be establishing clear and\ncredible boundaries around the federal financial safety net in a way that conforms the\nextent of the safety net to the extent of prudential regulation. This leaves open whether to\ndo so by expanding regulation to encompass a broader safety net, or contracting the\nsafety net to a more tightly drawn set of well-regulated institutions. This choice depends\non trade-offs that are beyond the scope of this address. My broad sense is that we would\nbe better off if we were to significantly scale back the boundaries of the governmentmanaged portion of the financial sector to include fewer institutions and their respective\nliabilities. It is not healthy when, in effect, profits are privatized and losses are socialized.\nCountervailing regulatory and supervisory regimes are inevitably imperfect and impose\ncostly burdens of their own.\nAs I noted earlier, establishing credible safety net boundaries will likely require that\npolicymakers permit the failure of an institution that was previously believed to be too\nbig to fail. This could involve serious short-term disruptions – in fact, it may be that the\nmore costly the disruption the greater the enhancement to safety net credibility. But the\nlong-term benefits would be quite large. When thinking about this issue, I am reminded\nof the history of monetary policy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. At the time, the\ncountry was experiencing both high unemployment and high rates of inflation. The Fed,\nunder the leadership of Paul Volcker, steadfastly pursued a path to bring down inflation.\nIt was, in some ways, a very painful course of action because the economy went through\na very significant recession in 1981 and 1982. But the economy did recover – and\nproceeded to grow relatively briskly – while the Fed credibly established that it would\npursue price stability. The short-term pain of scaling back the monetary accommodation\nof the 1970s was worth the cost. I think the same would be true of an effort to scale back\nand set credible boundaries around the federal financial safety net.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Aaron Steelman for assistance preparing this speech.\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "Statement\nOversight and Investigations Subcommittee\nof the Committee on Financial Services\nMarch 30, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThe Committee on Financial Services\nRayburn House Office Building\nWashington, D.C.\nGood afternoon. I’m honored to speak to this Subcommittee about the federal government’s financial\nsafety net and how the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act seeks to address it.\nAt the outset, I should point out that within the Federal Reserve System the Board of Governors has sole\nauthority to write rules implementing the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Federal Reserve Banks\nsupervise financial institutions under authority delegated to them by the Board of Governors. In keeping\nwith Board of Governors guidance, I will not discuss any current or potential Federal Reserve\nrulemaking. I also should say that my comments today are my own views and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or my colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks.\nMy views have been informed by both my leadership of the Fifth Federal Reserve District over the last\nseven years and my experience as a research economist, studying banking policy for the prior 25 years.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was a response to the most dramatic financial turmoil our country experienced in\ngenerations. In my view, the crisis resulted largely from a mismatch between a regulatory structure\ndesigned for the explicit safety net (consisting mainly of deposit insurance) and the extent of moral hazard\ninduced by a much broader implicit safety net. Given precedents dating back to Continental Illinois in the\n1980’s and beyond, market participants made inferences about what government protection might be\nforthcoming in future instances of financial distress—that is, which institutions were likely to be viewed\nby authorities as “too big to fail.” This lack of clarity about the safety net grew in the decades leading up\nto the crisis—and came about because policymakers hoped that “constructive ambiguity” would dampen\nthe markets’ expectations of bailouts, but preserve their option to intervene if necessary. Other factors\ncontributed to the crisis, but I believe the ambiguity of safety net policy was a major driver.\nResearchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond have estimated, based on conservative\nassumptions, that the implicit safety net covered as much as 40 percent of all financial sector liabilities by\nthe end of 2009. When combined with the explicit protection in place for depository institutions and other\nfirms, the broader federal financial safety net now covers 62 percent of the financial sector, compared to\nabout 45 percent a decade earlier. (See Table.)\n1\n\n\fDodd-Frank contains provisions that will help close the gap between the scope of prudential regulation\nand the scope of the implicit safety net. It allows the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate\nlarge non-bank financial firms as “systemically important” and subject them to more rigorous constraints\non risk-taking. The Act also seeks to limit the implicit safety net by empowering the FDIC to liquidate\ntroubled nonbank firms and placing new constraints on the Fed’s lending powers. But the FDIC retains\nconsiderable discretion in the use of funds to limit losses to some creditors, and the Treasury can invoke\norderly resolution for firms that have not been subject to enhanced regulation. The Fed also retains some\ndiscretionary power to lend to non-bank entities. This creates continued uncertainty about possible\nrescues, as well as gaps in our ability to provide clear, credible constraints on the safety net.\nIn the near term, I believe regulators have a firm grasp on the industry, and are taking strong steps to\ntighten risk management at regulated firms, but there are risks in the long-term because firms seen as\nenjoying broad safety net protection will have strong incentives to take on excessive risks. And firms will\nhave an incentive to by-pass regulation, if they can still enjoy some degree of implicit protection. This\ndesire to operate just outside the perimeter of regulation, but within the implicit safety net, will present\nongoing supervisory and regulatory challenges—and may make it difficult to prevent or limit the\nmagnitude of future crises.\nContinued ambiguity thus would pose risks to financial stability and the economy, including the risk of\nnew costs to taxpayers. But I believe the risks to the effectiveness of our financial system are even more\nsignificant. Over time, the devotion of resources to by-passing regulations can create new sources of\nfinancial instability and divert resources from the pursuit of financial innovations that are genuinely\nbeneficial to consumers. In the long run, economic growth and job creation would likely suffer.\nCreating clear and credible safety net constraints is likely to be difficult. One approach is to tightly limit\ndiscretion—including discretionary use of public funds to shield creditors. The Act takes important steps\nin that direction, yet substantial discretion remains around preferential treatment for certain creditors.\nA far more challenging approach is for regulators to retain discretion, but establish a credible commitment\nto following clear, pre-announced rules in times of crisis. For example, limiting FDIC resolution authority\nto firms that are regulated as “systemically important” would help block regulatory by-pass. The\ncredibility of such a commitment would require policymakers to allow significant creditor losses in cases\nin which they otherwise might have provided support.\nSome believe that without intervention the economy is too vulnerable to spillover damage from the\nfinancial system. I’ve argued that such spillovers are in large part the consequence of ambiguous\ngovernment rescue policy. If we can establish clear expectations about the federal financial safety net and\nlive up to our commitment to limit rescues, then we can have more confidence that our financial system\nwill contribute positively to economic growth.\nThank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n2\n\n\fEstimated Federal Financial Safety Net\n1999\n\n2009\n\nExplicitly\nGuaranteed\nLiabilities\n\nImplicitly\nGuaranteed\nLiabilities\n\nExplicitly &\nImplicitly\nGuaranteed\nLiabilities\n\n2,840\n\n820\n\n3,660\n\n47.6%\n\n13.8%\n\n61.4%\n\nTotal\nLiabilities\n\nExplicitly\nGuaranteed\nLiabilities\n\nImplicitly\nGuaranteed\nLiabilities\n\nExplicitly &\nImplicitly\nGuaranteed\nLiabilities\n\nTotal\nLiabilities\n\nFinancial Firms\nBanking and Savings Firms\n(includes BHCs)\n\nCredit Unions\n\n336\n\n336\n\n89.6%\n\n89.6%\n\nGovernment‐Sponsored\nEnterprises\nFannie Mae\nFreddie Mac\nFarm Credit System\nFederal Home Loan Banks\n\n1,199\n870\n74\n477\n\nTotal\n\nPrivate Employer\nPension Funds\n\n1,199\n870\n74\n477\n\n2,620\n\n2,620\n\n2,620\n\n100.0%\n\n100.0%\n\n1,805\n\n1,805\n\n86.3%\n\n86.3%\n\n6,536\n\n7,276\n\n13,812\n\n40.2%\n\n44.8%\n\n85.0%\n\n375\n\n1,199\n870\n74\n477\n\nOther Financial Firms\n(includes MMF for 2009)\n\nTotal for Financial Firms\n\n5,963\n\n2,090\n\n725\n\n725\n\n88.7%\n\n88.7%\n\n3,440\n\n8,421\n\n26.5%\n\n18.3%\n\n44.8%\n\n18,771\n\n3,345\n2,333\n188\n973\n6,838\n\n100.0%\n\n100.0%\n\n2,799\n\n2,799\n\n85.5%\n\n85.5%\n\n7,723\n\n4,981\n\n3,345\n2,333\n188\n973\n6,838\n\n16,249\n\n817\n\n3,345\n2,333\n188\n973\n6,838\n\n3,273\n\n4,048\n\n4,048\n\n18,458\n\n21.9%\n\n21.9%\n\n10,059\n\n18,162\n\n28,221\n\n45,635\n\n22.0%\n\n39.8%\n\n61.8%\n\n41.1%\n\n1999 and 2009 data from December, in billions of dollars.

Walter\n\nI\n\nn 2002, Walter and Weinberg examined the federal financial safety net\nas it stood at the end of 1999 (Walter and Weinberg 2002). At the time,\nthe authors estimated that approximately 45 percent of all financial firm\nliabilities were protected by the safety net. As one would expect in this article,\nthe current estimate indicates that the size of the net has grown, as the financial\nmarket turmoil that began in 2007 led federal government agencies to expand\nthe range of institutions and the types of liabilities protected by the safety net.\n\n1. THE SAFETY NET: ITS DEFINITION, COSTS,\nAND BENEFITS\nWalter and Weinberg defined the federal financial safety net as consisting of\nall explicit or implicit government guarantees of private financial liabilities.\nPrivate financial liabilities are those owed by one private market participant to\nanother. As used by Walter and Weinberg, the phrase government guarantee\nmeans a federal government commitment to protect lenders from losses due to\na borrower’s default (Walter and Weinberg 2002).1 Following this definition,\nwe include in our estimate of the safety net, insured bank and thrift deposits,\ncertain other banking company liabilities, some government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) liabilities, selected private employer pension liabilities, as well as\nThe authors would like to thank Jason Annis, Marc Chumney, Tim Pudner, and Deanna\nWest for providing data and valuable advice, as well as Huberto Ennis, Robert Hetzel,\nSabrina Pellerin, and John Weinberg for their insightful comments on an earlier draft.

The details of why we chose\nto include these liabilities are provided below.\n\nEffect of a Safety Net on Economic Efficiency\nGovernment actions in the form of subsidies, taxes, or regulations change\nmarket outcomes, and in competitive markets such changes distort allocations\nand can reduce economic efficiency. Does the financial safety net cause distortions? As discussed in Walter and Weinberg, in principle, the government\ncould design guarantees that mimic market outcomes. Typically, however,\ngovernment intervention arises from a desire to alter market outcomes. In\nthe case of guarantees, this means either expanding coverage or underpricing\nrelative to private market guarantees. Underpricing means that the guarantor collects fees that are less than the expected value of its obligations. This\nunderpricing subsidizes risk taking.\nUnderpriced guarantees tend to shift resources away from activities that\nare not covered toward those that are. In that way, a government guarantee\nis similar to a direct subsidy paid to those engaged in a particular activity. A\nguarantee is different, however, in the way it affects attitudes toward risk. By\nassigning to the government part of the risk in the activities being financed, the\nsafety net reduces market participants’ willingness to control risk. Overprovision of guarantees, while not necessarily drawing resources into an activity,\ndoes shift risk preferences in a way similar to underpricing. In short, guarantees lead to expanded risk taking.\nOur calculation of the size of the safety net does not represent a measure\nof the size of the distortions to the allocation of resources and risk taking.\nSuch a measure would require knowledge of the extent of underpricing or\noverprovision of government guarantees. Those would be difficult to measure,\nespecially the latter, since government provision often preempts private market\nactivity. We nevertheless believe that the extent of distortions is directly related\nto the size of the safety net. Other things being equal, the greater the share of\nprivate liabilities protected by the government safety net, the more likely it is\nthat government guarantees are extending beyond the level of protection that\nwould be provided in a private market.\n\nWhy Have a Safety Net?\nIf the safety net is distortionary, why have one? Proponents of the financial\nsafety net, especially as it applies to banks, often argue that private risksharing arrangements tend to disregard the systemic consequences of large\nlosses borne by an individual or a small group of institutions. The idea here is\nthat such losses might spill over and generate further losses caused, for example, by a contagious loss of investor confidence. Under such a view, govern-\n\n\fN. Malysheva and J. R. Walter: The Federal Financial Safety Net\n\n275\n\nment protection for certain investors could prevent widespread financial panic\nor distress. While the potential systemic consequences of a large financial\nfailure are difficult to assess, when faced with the possibility of widespread\nfailures of financial firms, policymakers are likely to conclude that preventing\nsuch failures by protecting creditors of financial firms (providing safety net\nprotection) is prudent.\nSimilarly, some observers maintain that the safety net protections can\nlower the costs of, and therefore encourage, certain highly beneficial financial\narrangements. For example, Diamond and Dybvig (1983) argue that banks’\nperformance of the maturity transformation function is highly beneficial to the\neconomy but is more costly without government-provided deposit insurance.\nBanks perform maturity transformation by gathering money from numerous\nshort-term depositors (those bank customers whose deposits mature soon after\ndeposited—especially checking deposits, which are available, meaning that\nthey mature, immediately after being deposited) to fund long-term loans to\nbusinesses and individuals. Without deposit insurance, which only the government has sufficient resources to provide, bank runs are likely to occur.\nA bank run happens when many depositors attempt to withdraw their funds\nsimultaneously. Since banks make long-term loans, they cannot recover sufficient money from borrowers to meet a run and, therefore, fail. To protect\nthemselves from runs, banks can undertake costly private measures, but Diamond and Dybvig argue that government deposit insurance is likely to be less\nexpensive and therefore preferable to such measures.\n\n2.\n\nLEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES THAT\nEXPANDED THE SAFETY NET\n\nAs shown in Table 1, we estimated the proportion of financial firm liabilities\nprotected as of the end of 2009. By the end of 2009, a number of government programs had been established to address turmoil in financial markets.\nEmploying methods similar to those used by Walter and Weinberg when they\nmeasured the size of the safety net for the end of 1999, we find that as of the\nend of 2009 about 59 percent of financial firm liabilities were protected by the\nfederal safety net.\nOne of the most important reasons for the increase from 1999 to 2009\nis the enlarged portion of banking firm liabilities that market participants are\nlikely to consider protected: banking and savings firm liabilities with an implicit backing. In 1999, implicitly guaranteed liabilities of banks and savings\ninstitutions amounted to about 13 percent of all of these firms’ liabilities (15.9\npercent for commercial banks and 4.2 percent for savings institutions), or $820\n\n\f24,921\n58.9%\n\n748\n4.9%\n\n2,799\n85.5%\n\n3,345\n2,333\n188\n973\n6,838\n100%\n\n725\n88.7%\n\n13,812\n85.0%\n\nExplicitly and Implicitly\nGuaranteed Liabilities\n\n42,335\n\n15,158\n\n3,273\n\n3,345\n2,333\n188\n973\n6,838\n\n817\n\n16,249\n\nTotal Liabilities\n\nNotes: Data from December 2009, in billions of dollars.

Walter: The Federal Financial Safety Net\n\n277\n\nbillion; in 2009, about 45 percent of banking and savings firm liabilities were\nimplicitly guaranteed, by our estimate, amounting to $7.3 billion.2\nHow did Walter and Weinberg determine which institutions to include as\nhaving an implicit guarantee and which liabilities issued by these institutions\nmight be covered? As the authors noted, the critical question is whether\nmarket participants believe that a given institution will be protected, even\nthough official policy may not state explicitly that all of these liabilities are\nprotected. As of 1999, Walter and Weinberg argued that market participants\nwere likely to assume that certain holders of liabilities in the largest 21 banking\ncompanies and the two largest thrift companies would be protected in the event\nthat these firms became troubled. These 21 banking companies and two thrifts\nall had assets (in 1999 dollars) of more than $50 billion, which was greater\nthan the smallest of the 11 institutions identified by the Comptroller of the\nCurrency in 1984 as potentially too big to fail (Walter and Weinberg 2002,\np. 381). The liabilities that Walter and Weinberg assumed the market would\nbe highly likely to view as protected were deposits of more than $100,000\n(deposits of less than $100,000 are included in the “Explicitly Guaranteed\nLiabilities” column in the tables), federal funds loans made to the 21 banks\nand two thrifts, and repo transactions with these banks and thrifts. Though\nwe intend to use a similar methodology for estimating the size of implicit\nguarantees for banking companies in 2009, events during the recent financial\ncrisis required some adjustments.\n\nSupport for Stress-Tested Financial Companies\nGiven that the government had responded aggressively to problems in financial\nfirms during the financial turmoil of 2008–2009, our challenge is to decide\nwhich institutions have implicit guarantees. Here we maintain that market\nparticipants were very likely to assume that the liabilities of the financial firms\nthat were stress tested early in 2009 (participants in the Supervisory Capital\nAssessment Program—SCAP) had a strong likelihood of receiving federal\nbacking if they suffered financial distress. Indeed, the announcement of the\nstress tests in February 2009 came with a promise of government-provided\ncapital for stress-tested institutions that were shown to be in need of additional\ncapital:\nUnder [the Treasury’s Capital Assistance Program] CAP, federal banking\nsupervisors will conduct forward-looking assessments [SCAP stress tests]\nto evaluate the capital needs of the major U.S. banking institutions under a more challenging economic environment. Should that assessment\nindicate that an additional capital buffer is warranted, banks will have\n\n2 An explanation of the factors underlying the large increase is provided below.\n\n\f278\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nan opportunity to turn first to private sources of capital. In light of the\ncurrent challenging market environment, the Treasury is making government capital available immediately through the CAP to eligible banking\ninstitutions to provide this buffer. (FinancialStability.gov 2009)\n\nAdditionally, a number of these firms did, in fact, receive government aid\nin the form of capital injections in 2008 and early 2009 through the Treasury’s\nCapital Purchase Program or in response to the stress tests (FinancialStability.gov 2010, pp. 21, 27, 67–80). This aid, both the aid promised under the\nCAP and aid received through the Capital Purchase Program, reduced the likelihood that all liabilityholders of the protected firms would suffer losses, so\nhere we include all liabilities of the stress-tested banking institutions in our\nsafety net calculation.\nWhile some observers in 2009 may have viewed the likely passage of\nfinancial reform legislation as diminishing federal backing, we nevertheless\ncount the liabilities of the stress-tested firms. Legislation that was intended\nto limit the chance that financial institutions would receive federal aid was\nbeing considered in the U.S. Congress during 2009. If market participants\nwere convinced that such legislation would forestall any opportunity for the\ncreditors of the largest financial institutions to be protected by the federal\ngovernment, then our calculation might appropriately exclude the liabilities\nof stress-tested banking institutions. In fact, most of the legislative proposals\nincluded language that called for the closure of troubled financial firms with\nlosses to equityholders and at least some creditors (though at least one leading\nproposal contained protections for creditors of financial firms if the failure of\nsuch a firm might create a systemic risk).3 Nevertheless, legislative proposals\ncontained provisions meant to establish a mechanism that could clearly identify “systemically important” financial firms. Such mechanisms seem likely\nto encourage market participant expectations of federal aid to the creditors of\nthe largest (i.e., systemically important) firms. Given the ambiguous effect of\nthe reform proposals on the probability of federal aid to the largest banking\nfirms, and the clear protections provided for troubled firms and for their creditors during the financial turmoil, we retain their liabilities in our estimate of\nliabilities protected by the safety net, in keeping with Walter and Weinberg\n(2002). (In a later section we remove the liabilities of stress-tested institutions\nand re-estimate the size of the safety net—see Table 2.)\nAs indicated earlier, the total liabilities of the 19 stress-tested bank holding\ncompanies, less their liabilities that were explicitly covered by deposit insurance, summed to $7.3 trillion (“Implicitly Guaranteed Liabilities” column in\n3 See H.R. 4173 as of December 2, 2009, p. 370, available at: http://www.house.gov/apps/\nlist/press/financialsvcs dem/presscfpa 121109.shtml.\n\n\fN. Malysheva and J. R. Walter: The Federal Financial Safety Net\n\n279\n\nthe tables). This sum equals about 45 percent of all banking and savings firm\nliabilities.\n\nIncreased Ceiling on Insured Deposits\nSeveral Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) programs expanded\nthe explicit portion of the safety net for banks and thrifts (“Explicitly Guaranteed Liabilities” column in the tables) beyond the long-standing $100,000\ncoverage for deposits (which are also included in the “Explicitly Guaranteed\nLiabilities” column in the tables).4 For example, in October 2008 the Emergency Economic StabilizationAct of 2008 temporarily increased FDIC deposit\ninsurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000, until December 31, 2009. In\nMay 2009, the $250,000 cap was extended to December 31, 2010, by the\nHelping Families Save Their Homes Act. In July 2010, legislation made permanent the $250,000 coverage limit (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n2010a).\n\nTransaction Account Guarantee Program\nFurther, in October 2008 the FDIC implemented a program to insure uninsured deposits (those deposits in accounts containing more than $250,000) in\nnoninterest-bearing transactions accounts for those insured banks and thrifts\nwishing to participate. The program is temporary. At first it covered such\ntransactions accounts until December 31, 2009. Later the FDIC extended\nthe program’s coverage until June 30, 2010, and then extended it again until\nDecember 31, 2010, with a pre-announced option to extend it an additional\n12 months (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 2010a).5 This program,\nthe Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP), added $834 billion to\nour “Explicitly Guaranteed Liabilities” column in the tables for banking and\nsavings firms (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 2009c).\n\nDebt Guarantee Program\nLast, in October 2008 the FDIC offered, to banking and savings institutions\nwishing to participate, the option to receive FDIC insurance coverage for senior\nunsecured debt issued by such institutions. This Debt Guarantee Program\n4 Since April 2006, deposits in certain retirement accounts at banks and thrifts have been\nprotected by the FDIC up to $250,000 (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 2006). Deposits in\nsuch accounts, up to the $250,000 ceiling, are included in the “Explicitly Guaranteed Liabilities”\ncolumn of our tables.\n5 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act extended coverage for\nnoninterest-bearing transaction accounts through December 31, 2012 (Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation 2010c).\n\n\f280\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\n\n(DGP) at first covered debt issued by June 30, 2009, and maturing by June 30,\n2010. The DGP was later extended to cover debt issued by October 31, 2009,\nand maturing by December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2009, the program\nwas insuring $309 billion in debt (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n2009b).\n\n3.\n\nOTHER COMPONENTS OF THE SAFETY NET\n\nAs in 1999, we include for 2009 the liabilities of government-sponsored enterprises (direct GSE liabilities plus the dollar amount of mortgage-backed\nsecurity guarantees) in the “Implicitly Guaranteed Liabilities” column in the\ntables. Earlier we noted that government guarantees can often modify market\nprices. Though our article has made no attempt to measure the size of guarantees’ effect on market prices, in the case of the GSEs’ implicit guarantee,\nthe size of the effect on market prices has been estimated by Passmore (2005)\nand others.6 Passmore (2005) estimates that the average homeowner saved\nbetween 3 and 11 basis points on his or her mortgage because of the implicit\nguarantee. The subsidy lowers the GSEs’ borrowing costs, and some of this\nsaved borrowing cost is passed on to homeowners by the GSE in the form of\nlowered mortgage interest rates. Passmore calculates that about half of the\nguarantee’s benefit flows to the shareholders of the GSEs. While the Treasury\nmade clear its support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac once these two financial firms were placed in conservatorship in September 2008, the support\nwas not as strongly stated as that given to insured deposits, so we leave these\nliabilities in the implicit column in the tables.7\nWe estimate the amount of private pensions explicitly guaranteed in 2009\nby the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) based on the latest\nprivate pension data available, which are data for 2007 (Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation 2010, pp. 83, 105). Our admittedly rough 2009 figure is\nderived by simply adjusting the 2007 figure by twice the average annual growth\nrate of private pension liabilities for the previous 10 years (1997–2007).\nWe also count all of the liabilities of American International Group (AIG)\nas implicitly guaranteed in the “Other Financial Firms” row in the tables.8\n6 Beyond Passmore, the Congressional Budget Office (2001) also developed estimates of the\nGSEs’ guarantee on mortgage interest rates.\n7 We treat Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as private entities and therefore include their liabilities in our table, consistent with the way Walter and Weinberg treated these entities, even though\nthe status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as privately owned firms is more ambiguous now than\nin 1999.\n8 The insured deposit liabilities of AIG’s savings bank are not included in the “Other Financial\nFirms” row since these liabilities were included in the “Banking and Savings Firms” row. While\nAIG owns a savings bank, it is not classified as a bank holding company (and does not file a bank\nholding company report [Y9C] with federal regulators), so we do not include it in the Banking\nand Savings Firms row.\n\n\fN. Malysheva and J. R. Walter: The Federal Financial Safety Net\n\n281\n\nWe count their liabilities as such because of the aid provided them by the\nFederal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury following AIG’s financial problems in\nSeptember 2008. Because there were no clear signals about whether aid might\nbe forthcoming for other large, nonbank financial firms (beyond the stress test\nfirms), we did not include the liabilities of any firms other than AIG in the\n“Other Financial Firms” row in tables.\n\n4. ALTERNATIVE ESTIMATES OF THE SIZE OF THE\nSAFETY NET\nAs has been noted, Table 1 is based on several assumptions similar to those\nmade by Walter and Weinberg in 2002. For example, we assumed that all\nliabilities of stress-tested bank holding companies would be protected, not\njust the liabilities representing FDIC-insured bank deposits. What would be\nthe size of the safety net if these assumptions were changed?\nContrary to our assumption about the likely protection of liabilityholders\nof stress-tested companies, one can imagine circumstances under which such\nliabilityholders might be left unprotected. If one of these companies were to\nfail at a time when financial markets were broadly healthy, policymakers could\nmore easily allow the company to be handled as a bankruptcy so that no government funds are employed to protect liabilityholders (of course, the holders\nof FDIC-insured deposits would still be covered given that such deposits are\nprotected regardless of the circumstances surrounding the failure). In times\nof general financial market strength, the failure of a large holding company\ncould perhaps be absorbed without worries of a cascade of additional failures.\nAnd at such times, if the firm were handled through the Dodd-Frank Act’s orderly liquidation process, it is possible that neither the government nor other\nfinancial firms would provide funds to protect liabilityholders.9\nWhile investors might expect large financial firm failures to typically occur in times of widespread financial weakness, and therefore anticipate that\ntheir investments would be protected, some large firms have failed in times of\nfinancial market health. One such example was London-based Barings Bank,\nwhich failed when financial markets were broadly strong in 1995. Its failure\nwas because of the huge trading losses generated by one unchecked Barings\ntrader who took large, unauthorized futures positions. Given that there are circumstances under which the holders of stress-tested company liabilities might\nbe left unprotected, dropping the assumption of their coverage and recalculating our estimate of implicitly guaranteed liabilities seems worthwhile.\n\n9 The Orderly Liquidation Authority section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-\n\nsumer Protection Act of 2010 contains provisions that allow funds gathered from assessments on\nthe largest financial firms to be used to protect liabilityholders.\n\n\f8,915\n21.1%\n\n2,799\n85.5%\n\n725\n88.7%\n\n5,392\n33.2%\n\nExplicitly Guaranteed\nLiabilities\n\n6,838\n16.2%\n\n3,345\n2,333\n188\n973\n6,838\n100%\n\nImplicitly Guaranteed\nLiabilities\n\n15,753\n37.2%\n\n2,799\n85.5%\n\n3,345\n2,333\n188\n973\n6,838\n100%\n\n725\n88.7%\n\n5,392\n33.2%\n\nExplicitly and Implicitly\nGuaranteed Liabilities\n\n15,158\n42,335\n\n3,273\n\n3,345\n2,333\n188\n973\n6,838\n\n817\n\n16,249\n\nTotal Liabilities\n\nNotes: Data from December 2009, in billions of dollars.

Malysheva and J. R. Walter: The Federal Financial Safety Net\n\n283\n\nLarge financial firms that are not bank holding companies might receive no\nprotection in such instances, so we also drop liabilities of AIG from those\nliabilities with implicit backing.\nAlso, we included in our explicitly insured deposits category those deposits\ncovered by the FDIC’s temporary guarantee programs, since these programs\nwere in place in 2009. But under the debt guarantee program no new debt\nissues were covered after October 31, 2009 (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 2010b). The TAGP was set to expire as of the end of 2010, though\nthe Dodd-Frank Act extended it to December 31, 2012. In the case of future\nfinancial firm failures, such programs may not be in place, and might not be\nreinstated. Therefore, re-estimating our measure of the size of the safety net\nwithout considering these deposits as protected also seems worthwhile.\nTable 2 contains our estimate of the size of the safety net without including\nthe liabilities of the stress-tested bank holding companies, AIG, and the FDIC\ntemporary insurance program deposits. These changes mean that, compared to\nTable 1, the proportion of liabilities receiving explicit and implicit guarantees\nfalls to 37.2 percent.\nAdditionally, while we assume that the liabilityholders of the housing and\nfarm credit GSEs will be protected from loss, as were such holders of Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac debt during the 2007–2009 financial crisis, under some\ncircumstances such holders might be left unprotected. As in the case of the\nstress-tested companies, if a GSE were to fail during a period in which financial markets were healthy, policymakers might leave debtholders unprotected.\nTherefore, it is possible that one might want to exclude the liabilities of the\nGSEs from the calculation of the safety net. If the $6.8 trillion in liabilities of\nthe GSEs were removed (which are the only implicitly guaranteed liabilities\nin Table 2), then our measure of the safety net would shrink to 21 percent of\ntotal liabilities in Table 2, the amount of explicit liabilities shown in Table 2.\nSome readers might contend that one category of liabilities, which we have\nexcluded from our safety net estimate, could legitimately be added: money\nmarket mutual fund liabilities. In the creation of our tables, and in Walter\nand Weinberg (2002), mutual fund liabilities are excluded because the principal value of mutual fund investments, including money market mutual fund\ninvestments, can decline, without the mutual fund defaulting, if the entity in\nwhich the funds are invested defaults. As a result, these investments are akin\nto equity and unlike private liabilities—the focus of our estimates—which\ntypically must pay back full principal (or else be in default). For example, an\ninvestor in a money market mutual fund, which in turn invested in financial\nfirm commercial paper, could lose principal if the commercial paper was not\nrepaid, but the mutual fund can continue to operate (i.e., not default).10 This\n10 Money market mutual funds are loath to pay back less than full principal (“break the\nbuck” in mutual fund parlance), and few have done so over time. Instead, the money market\n\n\f284\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\n\nview of money market mutual fund investments as equity must be tempered,\nhowever, by events in 2008. Specifically, the Treasury stepped in and protected investors in mutual funds from losses, thereby treating investments in\nthe funds like other guaranteed liabilities, in which losses are prevented by\ngovernment assistance or guarantees. As a result, one might argue that our\nestimates of the fraction of total liabilities carrying a government guarantee—\nboth the numerator and denominator—should include money market mutual\nfunds. If one adds the amount of such fund balances outstanding at the end of\n2009 ($3.3 trillion [Investment Company Institute 2010]) to our estimates in\nthe column “Explicitly and Implicitly Guaranteed Liabilities” in Table 1, the\nproportion would increase to 67 percent. The Table 2 figure would increase\nto 45 percent.\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nRecent government actions by legislators and financial regulators expanded\nthe federal financial safety net. Such actions include augmentation of deposit\ninsurance, debt guarantees for banking companies, aid to stress-tested financial firms, and, perhaps, various regulatory reform legislative proposals. As\ndiscussed in Walter and Weinberg (2002), this expansion has likely encouraged a view that liabilityholders will be protected by the federal government\nin times of financial difficulty in the future. As a result of this expectation of\ngovernment protection, liabilityholders will exercise less oversight over financial firm risk taking then they would without this expectation, financial firms\nwill undertake more risk, and financial market decisions will be distorted and\ninefficient.\n\nmutual fund’s parent typically injects funds to allow the fund to pay back full principal. This\nbehavior by mutual fund parent companies indicates that parent companies and investors may well\nview money market mutual fund investments more as liabilities than equity, regardless of the fact\nthat money market mutual funds can break the buck without defaulting.\n\n\fN.

This figure is inflated by twice (because 2007–\n2009 involves two years of growth) the average annual growth rate\nof PBGC-insured pension liabilities from 1997–2007 to obtain our\nestimate of all liabilities in pension funds insured by the PBGC as\nof December 31, 2009 ($2,946 billion). Since PBGC covers pensions only up to a specified maximum payment per year, a portion\nof beneficiaries’ pensions in guaranteed plans—those with pensions paying above this maximum—are not insured. According\nto the PBGC, this portion is estimated to be 4–5 percent (Pension\nBenefit Guarantee Corporation 2007, p. 24; Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation 1997, footnote to Table B-5). To arrive at the\nguaranteed portion of PBGC guaranteed pension fund liabilities,\nwe multiplied total 2009 fund liabilities ($2,946 billion) by 0.95 to\nyield $2,799 billion.\n\nPrivate Employer Pension Funds—Total Liabilities:\nThere appears to be no data on the total liabilities of all private employerdefined benefit pension funds.

To derive our figure, we begin\nwith our previously determined estimate of all private pension fund\nliabilities that are included in PBGC ($2,946) and then divide it by\n0.9 to arrive at our total liability figure of $3,273 billion. The PBGC\ninsures only about two-thirds of private sector single-employerdefined benefit plans, but almost all multi-employer plans (Pension\nBenefit Guarantee Corporation 2009, p. 5). Among the types\nof defined benefit plans PBGC does not insure are small (fewer\nthan 25 employees) plans maintained by small professional service\nemployers like doctors, lawyers, and accountants. Since the PBGC\nexcludes only the smaller single-employer plans, and includes most\nmulti-employer plans, we assume that it covers well more than 66\npercent (i.e., two-thirds) of all liabilities, setting our estimate at 90\npercent.\nOther Financial Firms—Implicitly Guaranteed Liabilities:\n“Total liabilities of AIG” found in its 10K report, less “estimated insured\ndeposits” of AIG Federal Savings Bank found on the FDIC’s website in the “Institution Directory” (http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp).\nOther Financial Firms—Total Liabilities:\nBoard of Governors (2010), Tables L.116—Property-Casualty Insurance\nCompanies; L.117—Life Insurance Companies; L.126—Issuers\n\n\fN.

            "content": "“Prudential Stress Testing in Theory and Practice:\nComments on ‘Stressed Out: Macroprudential Principles for Stress Testing’”\nFebruary 25, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n2011 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nNew York City, New York\nI am pleased to have this opportunity to be with you today to discuss stress testing. In the wake of the\nhousing bust and subsequent financial turmoil, the regulation and supervision of financial institutions and\nmarkets has been the subject of intense scrutiny. The 2009 U.S. stress tests appeared to play a critical role\nin the resolution of the crisis, which has led to recommendations that such tests, with appropriate\nrefinements, be made a routine component of the supervisory regime for large financial institutions.\nIndeed, as the authors note, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates annual stress tests for bank holding companies\nand nonbank financial firms supervised by the Federal Reserve. Analysis of the motivation for and design\nof supervisory stress tests is therefore well worthwhile.\nIn this paper the authors draw a sharp distinction between microprudential and macroprudential\napproaches to regulation, and they use this distinction as the main lens through which they assess the\ncurrent conduct of stress tests. They distinguish between the different theoretical motivations for\nmicroprudential and macroprudential regulation, and contrast what they view as distinct practices\nassociated with the two approaches. They go on to sketch out a method of evaluating the overall strength\nof a banking system based on correlations between equity prices and CDS spreads. On the basis of their\nanalysis, they argue that the stress tests conducted in the U.S. in 2009 and Europe in 2010 have brought\nabout insufficient improvements in financial conditions. And they conclude with a set of\nrecommendations for regulators as to how their stress tests should be improved.\nThe Distinction Between Microprudential and Macroprudential Regulation in Theory\nI will begin with their discussion of the motivation for prudential regulation and what that implies about\nstress tests. Microprudential regulation, according to the authors, aims to offset the moral hazard\ndistortions associated with deposit insurance, in which case the purpose of stress tests is to ensure that\nbank capital buffers are large enough to keep incentives well aligned. In contrast, macroprudential\nregulation aims to “control the social costs associated with excessive balance-sheet shrinkage on the part\nof multiple financial institutions hit with a common shock.” The authors cite the burgeoning theoretical\nliterature on fire sales, margin spirals and other financial market spillovers, where the flaws inherent in\nmodern financial markets also distort financial institution decisions, beyond distortions due to\ngovernment guarantees.\nI want to make two comments here. First, the formal economic modeling of financial fragility is still in its\ninfancy, and in my view models of financial market spillovers do not yet provide a persuasive foundation\nfor policy making. What we have so far is a collection of “possibility theorems” showing that under a\nparticular collection of assumptions the prices and quantities of some financial instruments could fall\ndramatically. Of course, since the fundamentals are unobserved, there is usually an alternative theory with\n1\n\n\fequivalent price and quantity predictions under which observed arrangements are reasonably efficient.\nOne strategy for distinguishing between alternative theories is to assess the plausibility of shifts in\nfundamentals large enough to rationalize observed price changes. To my knowledge, such head-to-head\ncontests between alternative theories of financial strains are relatively rare.\nAnother strategy for distinguishing between alternative theories of financial fragility is to compare a\nbroad range of qualitative model characteristics against real world observations. Models of financial\nmarket spillovers generally rely on frictions that lead to some form of market segmentation and “cash-inthe-market pricing” under which assets can sell for less than their fundamental value. I have a hard time\nreconciling the apparent fluidity of modern financial markets with the notion that market segmentation is\npervasive enough to warrant frequent and widespread interventions. Indeed, one stylized fact about this\ncrisis is that from mid-2007 onward a substantial amount of investable wealth was reported to be “on the\nsidelines” awaiting more attractive asset prices.\nI get the sense, though, that the popularity of policy prescriptions derived from models of financial\nspillovers owes less to hardnosed evaluation of microeconomic foundations, than to the attraction of a\npopular class of narratives about the crisis we’ve just been through. 1 In these accounts, regulators did not\nfully appreciate the extent to which (under regulated) financial markets are inherently prone to excessive\nrisk-taking, and did not have the full set of tools to cope with the resulting financial fragilities. These\naccounts imply, consistent with our authors’ recommendations that stress tests ought to focus on\nmitigating the distortionary effects of the spillovers that run rampant in financial markets.\nAn alternative narrative that I find more compelling builds on the moral hazard associated with explicit\ngovernment guarantees and the time consistency dilemma associated with ambiguous implicit\nguarantees. 2 This narrative acknowledges the potential fragility associated with maturity transformation,\nboth inside and outside of the banking sector, but emphasizes the extent to which such fragility is a matter\nof choice by financial intermediaries, particularly the extent to which inefficient runs can be prevented\nthrough partial suspension provisions or avoided altogether through longer-term funding. Constructive\nambiguity biases policy towards rescues and dampens creditors’ incentives to avoid vulnerability.\nMaturity transformation proliferates and the implicit safety net expands. 3\nThis alternative narrative illuminates the critical role of the 2009 U.S. stress tests – the so-called\nSupervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP). By the time the Capital Assistance Program was\nannounced on February 23, 2009, several large banks already had received equity-diluting government\ncapital injections as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Rumors circulated that the administration\nwas considering the outright nationalization of many large financial institutions. The acceleration in the\neconomic contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 implied a broad deterioration in the outlook for\nbusiness and consumer lending portfolios. Financial statements were an inadequate guide to the\nmagnitude of future losses, however, because Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations\nprevented reserving for expected future loan losses more than four quarters ahead, even if they were\nreasonably forecastable. So uncertainty about future loan losses and government rescue policy, combined\nwith limitations in financial reporting, made new equity issuance nearly impossible.\nIn this context, the SCAP tests served two critical purposes. First, the test results provided more reliable\nestimates of current and potential future capital positions than would otherwise have been available to\ninvestors. By projecting losses over a three-year horizon, instead of being limited to a one-year horizon\nunder SEC reporting rules, it provided more complete estimates of current equity. 4 Projections also were\nvalidated collectively by supervisory teams to assure consistency across participating financial firms and\nprovide investors with credibly verified reports.\n\n2\n\n\fSecond, and perhaps most importantly, the Program provided a clear statement of the government’s\nintentions for capital injections. If additional capital was required, and institutions could not raise enough\nnew equity privately, the government would provide a buffer in the form of mandatory convertible\npreferred shares. If the hole could be filled with private equity, further dilution by government capital\ninjections would be unlikely barring a much more adverse scenario. The U.S. stress tests therefore\nclarified the intended boundaries around future government interventions.\nThat clarity came at the cost, however, of establishing precedents that expanded the implicit government\nsafety net for financial firms. According to a recent estimate by Richmond Fed staff, 40 percent of bank\nand savings institution liabilities were explicitly guaranteed at the end of 2009, while an additional 45\npercent could reasonably be viewed, on the basis of official actions and statements, as implicitly\nguaranteed. 5 Back in 1999, only 13 percent of bank and savings institution liabilities were implicitly\nguaranteed by this criterion, while 50 percent were explicitly guaranteed.6 Overall, government\nguarantees thus expanded from 63 percent of banking liabilities to 85 percent.\nThe Distinction Between Microprudential and Macroprudential Regulation in Practice\nI have been discussing the theoretical distinctions between macroprudential and microprudential\napproaches to stress tests. I would also like to comment on the practical distinctions the authors draw\nbetween macroprudential and microprudential approaches to stress tests. Here, I think the authors\noverstate the differences.\nThe authors emphasize the goal of ensuring that the banking system has sufficient capacity to continue\nlending. On that basis they argue that evaluating bank solvency based on capital ratios rather than the\ndollar value of capital allows banks to remedy capital deficiencies by reducing lending, potentially\nexacerbating the effect of banking system deleveraging on credit supply. “Supervisors should mandate,”\nthe authors state, “dollar amounts for capital additions rather than focusing on restoration of capital\nratios.” This is what we actually did. Financial firms participating in the SCAP were asked to estimate\nexpected losses on their year-end 2008 portfolios under the two macroeconomic scenarios and compare\nthem to current capital, plus current allowance for loan and lease losses plus resources available from preprovision net revenue over the two-year horizon. Firms generally were not allowed to meet their capital\nneed by planning to shrink their balance sheets.\nI also think the authors are a bit off-base in criticizing current stress tests for neglecting wholesale\nfunding. It’s true that runs by short-term creditors would pose risks to financial institutions. But the\ncentral premise of the Capital Assistance Program was that participating banks would receive government\nfunds to ensure they remained amply capitalized. That implied a commitment to support those firms’\ndeposit and non-deposit liabilities – in essence, to do “whatever it takes” in the event of a run. SCAP was\ndesigned to reduce uncertainty about how much government capital was needed to prevent runs. To the\nextent that broad banking system support by Europeans governments was a presumption at the end of\n2009, I think the same argument applies to their stress tests as well.\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act is aimed at altering the presumption of full government support for the\nliabilities of large financial institutions. The failure of a large “systemically important” institution is to be\nhandled under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Orderly Liquidation Authority. The FDIC can\nborrow from the U.S. Treasury to fund the continued operations of the seized institution, but creditors are\nto receive no more than they would under a straight liquidation. The FDIC has the authority, however, to\nmake exceptions to that requirement. Retaining broad discretion to rescue creditors would perpetuate the\n“constructive ambiguity” that led to the dramatic expansion of the government safety net in recent\ndecades. So it is not clear whether the presumption of full creditors support is behind us.\n3\n\n\fI have not yet commented on the empirical work that the authors use to support their hypothesis that the\nstress tests have not significantly improved financial market conditions. The authors recognize that news\nabout shocks that are common across financial institutions, including changes in expectations regarding\ngovernment rescue policy, could swamp the idiosyncratic news about individual institutions, in which\ncase correlations among equity prices and CDS spreads are all positive and one cannot distinguish\nbetween their different cases. Because risk exposures have been so similar across large institutions, it\nseems quite plausible to me that a large portion of the variation in their equity prices and CDS spreads\nreflect common shocks, including common movements in expectations about government support.\nOne prominent thread in the authors’ discussion is the importance of ensuring that healthy banks are\ncapable of rescuing problem banks in a crisis. But U.S. banking institutions raised substantial amounts of\nequity in public markets or through direct placements between the beginning of the crisis in 2007 and the\nfall of 2008 when events raised uncertainty about government dilution and made such investments\nproblematic. 7 My sense is that outside equity deserves supervisors’ attention as well.\nConclusion\nSo while I applaud the authors’ attention to the theory and practice of supervisory stress tests, I part\ncompany regarding the distinction between macroprudential and microprudential perspectives. Most of\ntheir practical recommendations for the actual conduct of stress tests strike me as useful, but I think of\nthem as “prudential stress tests done right” rather than as a sharp break from past practice.\nI would like to close with some general comments on the use of stress tests. As I have said, they have\nproven their usefulness in the crisis. Quantifying the risks at large financial institutions is a complex and\ncostly process that is vulnerable to manipulation. A disciplined and well-organized supervisory process\nfor validating those assessments strikes me as well worth the costs. Stress tests are not a panacea,\nhowever. In a sense they are only as good as the imagination of the scenario designers, who need to resist\nthe temptation to dismiss extreme scenarios as too far-fetched or focus too much attention on preparing\nfor the last war.\nOne critical question about stress tests is whether or not to disclose the results, and if so, at what level of\ndetail. A good case can be made for transparency; stress tests provide quantitative assessments that are\nforward-looking, independently certified and methodologically comparable across institutions. On the\nother hand, there can be good reasons to restrict the release of bank-specific supervisory information. 8 As\nis often the case in financial regulation, the answer is not as obvious as it might seem.\n1\n\nVincent Reinhart, “A Year of Living Dangerously: The Management of the Financial Crisis in 2008,” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives, Winter 2011, vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 71-90.\n2\nSee Jeffrey M.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, February 2011\nFebruary 8, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nUniversity of Delaware\nNewark, Delaware\n\nI do not often get invited to speak outside of the Fifth Federal Reserve District, which is the Richmond Fed’s\nterritory, but when I do, it is a pleasure to visit the district of such a good friend and colleague as President\nCharles Plosser of the Third Federal Reserve District. As President of the Philly Fed, Charlie has spoken at this\nevent in the past, which implies some measure of continuity today, since I rarely find fault with his perspectives.\nThat said, I should note that my comments today on the economic outlook are indeed my own, and should not be\ntaken to implicate President Plosser or any other of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).1\nOur economy, overall, is growing at a steadily increasing pace and inflation is low and stable, although, as\nalways, visible risks to this outlook for continued recovery remain. The most striking feature of this recovery is\nthat until recently it has been relatively slow compared to past recoveries, particularly those following the two\nother severe recessions of the past 60 years – the recessions of 1973-75 and 1981-82.\nWhy has this recovery been subpar? The obvious explanation is that the housing boom that preceded the\nrecession has produced a housing stock that is too large, both in number and size, relative to what households\nwant given current income prospects and credit market conditions. As a consequence, residential investment has\nfailed to make a positive contribution to growth in this recovery. In contrast, residential investment rose at an\naverage of 40 percent in the first year of recovery following the recessions of 1973-75 and 1981-82. Apart from\nhousing, other household outlays have grown relatively slowly in this recovery as well. Consumer expenditures\nincreased at an annual rate just below 2 percent in the first five quarters of this recovery. In contrast, in the two\nother severe post-war U.S. recessions household spending grew by an average of 6-½ percent in the first year of\nexpansion, thereby adding considerably to GDP growth.\nRecently, however, consumer spending has picked up speed. Personal consumption expenditures are estimated\nto have risen at a 4.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. The concurrent decline in the personal saving rate\nsuggests that many households see brighter income prospects ahead, an assessment that is supported by\nemerging evidence that labor market conditions are improving. Initial unemployment claims have been on a\ndownward trend since last summer. The unemployment rate has fallen by half a percent over the last two months\nand by more than a percentage point since the fall of 2009. Manufacturers have added to payrolls over the last\nthree months. And average hourly earnings continue to advance. Granted, last Friday’s employment report\nshowed smaller net additions to payrolls than expected. But an array of forward looking indicators of\nemployment trends point to continued labor market improvement. For example, the employment components of\nseveral business surveys, such as the ISM’s, have shown increasingly positive readings, particularly in the\nmanufacturing sector.\nThe recent decline in the personal saving rate also suggests that many households have made substantial\nprogress toward repairing their balance sheets. American households stepped up savings during the recession in\norder to pay down debt and rebuild assets. That prudence, combined with significant gains in equity values since\nearly 2009, has led to substantial improvements in the financial positions of many households. Since the end of\nthe recession, the net worth of households has increased by slightly over $4 trillion and is up substantially from\n1\n\n\fits low point in the cycle. Given these stronger fundamentals, it seems quite reasonable to project robust growth\nin consumer spending this year.\nBusiness investment also should make a significant contribution to growth this year. Investment in equipment\nand software has grown 22 percent since the end of the recession. Opportunities to streamline business processes\nand reduce costs through productivity-enhancing investments appear to be widespread. And the pickup in\ndemand growth is providing further encouragement for capital spending plans.\nEven investment in new structures is showing some encouraging signs of bottoming out. Spending for private\nnonresidential structures has risen slightly over the last several months. And, a leading indicator for future\nspending, the American Institute of Architects’ Billing Index, has moved into positive territory for the first time\nin over two years. Taken as a whole, then, business investment is likely to add significantly to growth this year.\nProspects for export growth also look encouraging. Exports of goods and services have risen 18 percent since\nthe end of the recession, adding 2 percent to GDP growth. While growth in some of our major trading partners\nhas been uneven, expansion has been robust in important emerging economies. Thus demand for American\nexports is likely to contribute to growth this year as well.\nDespite all that the economy has going for it, there are still substantial challenges ahead. Housing activity\nobviously continues to be depressed; residential investment has fallen nearly 60 percent from its peak at the end\nof 2005. Given the large inventory of vacant homes in major markets and the ongoing foreclosure wave that\ncontinues to generate sales, any advance in residential investment is likely to be slow and uneven. Having said\nthat, residential investment is only 2-¼ percent of GDP, so the damage this sector is capable of inflicting is in\nsome sense limited.\nAll in all, then, I expect noticeably stronger growth in overall activity this year than last. If I had to write down a\nforecast today, it would be pretty close to 4 percent. A rate of growth in that neighborhood would result in\ncontinued net gains in employment and further reduction in the unemployment rate.\nThis generally positive assessment is complemented by the benign outlook for inflation. Over the 12 months\nending in December, the price index for personal consumption expenditure has risen 1.2 percent. This low\ninflation rate seems more consistent with our price stability mandate than the figures over 2 percent that were\ncommon in the years leading up to this recession. Many forecasters are expecting inflation this year to come in\nbetween 1-½ and 2 percent. That is my expectation as well, and would represent a good outcome. Still, recent\nincreases in commodity prices are showing up in consumer price measures and will put upward pressure on\noverall inflation numbers in the months ahead. Just how much is hard to say. The effect on overall inflation\ncould be transitory, or could persist if firms, encouraged by accelerating demand growth, pass input prices on to\ntheir customers. Such pickups in inflation are common at this point in business cycle upturns, and would be\nconsistent with the expected inflation rates implied by prices of inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury debt, which\nshow market participants now expecting inflation to average 2 percent over the next five years, and as much as 3\npercent over the following five years.\nThat’s the near-term outlook in a nutshell. Beyond this coming year, the configuration of fiscal policies could\nhave a significant bearing on growth prospects. We have a serious, long-term mismatch between the trajectories\nof federal spending and taxes. Most of you are no doubt aware of the long-term budget projections published by\nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Their most recent projections, under plausible assumptions and\ncurrent legislation, show deficits falling from around 9 percent of GDP now to around 5 percent of GDP in 2015\nand trending steadily upward thereafter. The ratio of debt to GDP rises from the current level of around 60\npercent to 150 percent in 2030.\n2\n\n\fBe clear: there is no uncertainty about whether the long-run federal budget imbalance will be corrected.\nContinual increases in debt relative to the size of our economy are simply not feasible and will not happen. The\nreal question is how a sustainable path will be achieved. In advance, by deliberately adopting and following a\ncredible strategy, or in extremis, forced by investor retreat and collapsing market confidence to adopt drastic\nemergency measures? We would be wise to heed the abundant empirical evidence of the superiority of taking\naction before a fiscal crisis is upon us.\nOne serious fiscal risk over the long-term concerns the open question of the federal government’s role in\nhousing finance. This year, Washington is poised to consider the fate of the government-sponsored enterprises\n(GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, now operating under government conservatorship. The perception that\nthese two private mortgage intermediaries enjoyed implicit government backing reduced the aversion of their\ncreditors to large downside risks. The resulting incentive misalignment, combined with escalating low-income\nhousing targets, drove the GSEs to accumulate significant exposure to non-prime mortgages, which exacerbated\nthe overbuilding and thus contributed to the magnitude of the resulting decline.\nMany proposals would make government guarantees on home mortgages explicit and priced; such proposals\ndiffer mainly in the nature of the intermediaries through which such guarantees would be channeled. But\nperpetuating guarantees for housing-related debt will continue to artificially stimulate the risky leverage that\ncritically fueled the disastrous housing boom we have just experienced. The devastating consequences of the\nhousing bust suggest that government backstops for housing finance are not worth the price of over-built, overleveraged and at times overheated housing markets, on top of the fiscal burden of large contingent liabilities. I\nbelieve we should phase out government guarantees for home mortgage debt. Otherwise, financial stability will\nto be elusive, and fiscal balance will be threatened by repeated boom-bust cycles in housing. Home-ownership\nmay be a laudable social goal, but if that is our objective, we should subsidize housing equity, not housing debt.\nI will conclude with a few remarks on monetary policy. During the recession, the Federal Reserve cut short-term\ninterest rates to near zero and expanded the supply of central bank money – that is, currency and bank reserves –\nfrom under $900 billion to over $2 trillion, which in my view was an appropriate response to a major economic\nshock. In addition, the FOMC in November decided to further increase the supply of Federal Reserve money by\nanother $600 billion by the end of the second quarter through purchases of long-term U.S. Treasury securities.\nThe Committee recognized that the provision of further monetary stimulus at this point in the business cycle is\nnot without risks, and therefore committed to regularly review the pace and overall size of the asset-purchase\nprogram in light of incoming information and adjust the program as needed. The distinct improvement in the\neconomic outlook since the program was initiated suggests taking that re-evaluation quite seriously. That reevaluation will be challenging, because inflation is capable of accelerating, even if the level of economic activity\nhas not yet returned to pre-recession trend.\nWe’ve come through an extraordinary period in our economic history, which in turn brought about extraordinary\npolicy responses. As the economic expansion continues to strengthen, the challenge becomes determining the\ntime and manner by which policy returns to a more normal mode of behavior. The public’s confidence that\npolicy actions derive from a coherent, sustainable long-term plan for policy – both monetary and fiscal – will be\nan important factor supporting growth in the years to come.

            "content": "EMBARGOED UNTIL PRESIDENT LACKER BEGINS SPEAKING – TARGET TIME 12: 45 P.M. EST\n\nEconomic Outlook, January 2011\nJanuary 14, 2011\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nRisk Management Association, Richmond Chapter\nOMNI Hotel\nRichmond, Va.\n\nI am sure you are all familiar with the macroeconomic background to our current situation, even if you\ndid not attend last year’s luncheon. The 18-month long recession that ended in June 2009 was the most\nsevere contraction since the Great Depression. In the five quarters that followed, real GDP grew at only a\n2.9 percent annual rate, which is barely above trend and is quite modest when compared to other cyclical\nrecoveries. Particularly frustrating was the soft patch that the economy entered last summer when GDP\ngrowth fell below 2 percent. But I believe we have emerged from that soft patch and have begun a phase\nof the recovery in which growth can be sustained at an above-trend rate. That should help us make more\nrapid progress on our pressing economic challenges.\nLet’s take a closer look at our relatively sluggish economic performance in this recovery. But before we\ndo, let me note that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC.)1 An obvious explanation is the sharp drop in\nhousing construction. The preceding housing boom caused significant overbuilding in most regions,\nwhich resulted in a large number of vacant houses that were good substitutes for new construction. This\noverhang has dampened housing activity in many local markets and has kept new housing starts at about\nhalf the rate that would be needed to grow the housing stock at the same rate as population. Consequently,\nresidential investment has failed to make a positive contribution to growth in this recovery. In contrast,\nconsider the two most severe recessions of the past 60 years before the most recent episode – the\nrecessions of 1973-75 and 1981-82. Residential investment rose at an average of 40 percent in the first\nyear of recovery following those recessions.\nWhat has been particularly striking this time is the behavior of household spending. In a typical recovery,\nconsumers gradually begin to see a brighter future ahead and add to spending ahead of anticipated gains\nin employment and income. That did not happen in the first five quarters of this recovery, in which\nconsumer spending increased at an annual rate just below 2 percent. This is in contrast to the two other\nsevere recessions when household spending grew by an average of 6-½ percent in the first year of\nexpansion, thereby adding considerably to GDP growth. Thus a major part of the relative weakness of the\nearly part of this recovery has been due to the cautious pace of household spending.\nAnd there were ample reasons for caution. First, the labor market remained weak in the early stage of the\nrecovery. The unemployment rate hit 10.1 percent in October, 2009, and only declined marginally\nthrough most of last year. Second, during the recession consumer wealth was battered by a sharp drop in\nstock prices and a substantial fall in home prices. As a result, households devoted more of their income to\nrepairing their balance sheets by reducing outstanding credit and rebuilding savings; spending growth had\nto take a back seat.\n\n\f2\n\nWhile housing construction and consumer spending underperformed in this recovery, I should note that\nequipment and software investment and exports have been stronger than in comparable past recoveries.\nInvestment in nonresidential structures has been weak, but no weaker than was typical in past recoveries.\nAgainst that backdrop of a disappointingly sluggish recovery, many of our readings for the last quarter of\n2010 point to a distinctly sunnier outlook. Most importantly, consumer spending is starting to show some\nreal signs of life. Retail sales rose at a blistering 12 percent annual rate over the five months ending in\nDecember. We also know that auto and light truck sales posted a solid 2.3 percent seasonally-adjusted\nadvance in December from the previous month, and that capped off a fourth quarter that was the strongest\nin over two years.\nThe fundamentals supporting household demand also are improving. Labor markets have been gradually\nfirming. The national unemployment rate ended last year down 0.7 percentage point from its peak. Payroll\nemployment has been growing, with 128,000 jobs per month added in the fourth quarter. In another sign\nof improving demand for labor, the average work week increased by a half hour last year. And while the\ngrowth in average hourly earnings was only 1.8 percent last year, inflation was even less, at 1.0 percent,\nso real earnings were on an upward trajectory.\nThe firmer labor market has given a modest boost to growth in real household income. At the same time,\nincreased saving has allowed many households to pay down debt and build assets. Household debt has\nfallen for the last 2-½ years, and stock prices have risen significantly during the recovery, which has led\nto substantial improvements in the financial positions of many households. Since the end of the recession,\nthe net worth of households has increased by slightly over $4 trillion and is up about 12 percent from its\nlow point in the cycle. Given these stronger fundamentals, it’s not a stretch to project robust growth in\nconsumer spending this year.\nBusiness investment also should make a significant contribution to growth this year. Investment in\nequipment and software has grown 20 percent since the end of the recession. Technological innovations\ncontinue to provide organizations with new opportunities for streamlining business processes and\nreducing costs through productivity-enhancing investments. Moreover, the cost of capital is extremely\nlow for a large segment of corporate America, and credit conditions have eased some, with business\nlending by banks beginning to rise in fourth quarter. Even investment in new structures is showing some\nencouraging signs of bottoming out. Spending for private nonresidential structures has risen slightly over\nthe last four months. And, a leading indicator for future spending, the American Institute of Architects’\nBilling Index, has moved into positive territory for the first time in over two years. All in all, then,\nbusiness investment is likely to add significantly to growth this year.\nI am also encouraged by the prospects for export growth. Exports of goods and services have risen 16\npercent since the end of the recession, adding 1-¾ percent to GDP growth. While growth in some of our\nmajor trading partners has been uneven, expansion has been robust in important emerging economies.\nThus demand for American exports is likely to be quite firm this year as well.\nThe economy has a lot going for it, although there are still considerable difficulties ahead. Housing\nactivity obviously continues to be depressed; residential investment has fallen nearly 60 percent from its\npeak at the end of 2005. Given the large inventory of vacant homes in major markets and the ongoing\nforeclosure wave that continues to generate sales, any advance in residential investment is likely to be\nslow and uneven. For the record, though, residential investment is only 2-¼ percent of GDP, so further\n\n\f3\n\ndevelopments in this sector will not have a large effect on overall growth. Also, we have seen small\nincreases in residential construction spending in each of the last three months, so I would be not be\nsurprised if the worst was behind us in the housing market.\nAll in all, then, I expect stronger growth in overall activity this year than last. Most private forecasters\nhave been busy bumping up their forecasts in recent weeks, and forecasts of 4 percent growth are\nbeginning to surface. If I had to write down a forecast today, it would be pretty close to that – somewhere\nbetween 3.5 and 4 percent. A rate of growth in that range would result in continued net gains in\nemployment and a more sizable reduction in the unemployment rate than we’ve seen so far.\nLet me digress for a moment to comment on prospects for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Hiring here\npicked up more rapidly than for the nation last year. Year-over-year employment growth in Virginia was\nmore than double the national figure – 1.3 percent versus 0.6 percent. Moreover, the overall impact of the\nrecession has been less severe in Virginia, where the unemployment rate is about three percentage points\nlower than the national rate. In contrast, the Richmond area has not yet added jobs relative to a year ago,\nbut appears poised to gain some ground after two-and a-half years of contraction. Not surprisingly, the\nRichmond metropolitan area’s unemployment rate, at 7.4 percent, is higher than the state average, but we\nexpect this will edge downward as job growth in the region gains momentum.\nThis generally positive assessment, both for the region and the nation as a whole, is complemented by the\nbenign outlook for inflation. Over the 12 months ending in November the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditure, our preferred price measure at the Richmond Fed, has only risen 1.0 percent.\nThat’s a relatively low inflation rate, especially compared with figures over 2 percent that were common\nin the years leading up to this recession. The downward trend in inflation during the recession had many\ncommentators warning of the possibility of outright deflation. At this point, I think the risk of deflation is\nnegligible. That’s consistent with the expected inflation rates implied by prices of inflation-indexed U.S.\nTreasury debt, which show market participants now expecting inflation to average 2 percent over the next\nfive years, and 3 percent over the five years after that. The recent increases in energy prices will show up\nin consumer price measures for the next few months, pushing overall inflation numbers up somewhat.\nForecasters are expecting inflation this year to come in between 1 and a half and 2 percent, and that is my\nexpectation as well.\nThat’s the near-term outlook in a nutshell. Beyond this coming year, a lot depends on the configuration of\nfiscal and regulatory policies. On the fiscal front, we have a serious, long-term mismatch between the\ntrajectories of spending and taxes. Many businesses contemplating new capital spending face significant\nuncertainty about how future cash flows will be taxed. And any business selling to the government has to\nrecognize the possibility of new spending limits. Be clear: there is no uncertainty about whether the longrun federal budget imbalance will be corrected. Projections of steadily diverging revenue and spending,\nsuch as the estimates published by the Congressional Budget Office, are simply not feasible and will not\nhappen. The real question is how a sustainable path will be achieved: in advance, by deliberately adopting\na credible strategy, or in extremis, forced by collapsing market confidence to adopt drastic emergency\nmeasures? We would be wise to heed the abundant empirical evidence of the superiority of taking action\nbefore a crisis is upon us.\nOn the regulatory side, thousands of pages of new legislation have been recently enacted and many new\nimplementing regulations are in the process of being drafted and adopted. Anticipated shifts in regulatory\npolicy appear to have produced a degree of apprehension that has dampened private sector willingness to\n\n\f4\n\nhire and invest. As implementation proceeds, the shape of the new regulatory regimes will come into view\nand the dampening effect of regulatory uncertainty may dissipate.\nFor federal financial policy, however, major unfinished business remains; we have yet to resolve the\ngovernment’s role in housing finance. The appalling consequences of the housing boom should\nthoroughly discredit a system centered around private mortgage intermediaries with implicit government\nguarantees. Making those guarantees explicit and priced is a key component of many popular proposals,\nbut that would just recreate many of the incentives of the old regime and continue to burden taxpayers\nwith huge contingent liabilities. Financial stability and fiscal balance are likely to be illusive if we do not\nwind down government subsidies and guarantees for housing debt. Home-ownership may be a laudable\nsocial goal, but if so, we should subsidize housing equity, not housing leverage.\nI will conclude with a few remarks on monetary policy. During the recession, the Federal Reserve cut\nshort-term interest rates to near zero and expanded its balance sheet from around $900 billion to over $2\ntrillion, which in my view was an appropriate response to a major economic shock. In addition, the\nFOMC in November decided to further increase the Fed’s balance sheet by another $600 billion by the\nend of the second quarter through purchases of long-term U.S. Treasury securities. While this was\nmotivated mainly by the disappointing pace of employment growth, the provision of further monetary\nstimulus at this point in the business cycle is not without risks. I was among those who viewed the\nbenefits as outweighed by the risks, including the risk that a larger balance sheet might complicate the\nwithdrawal of monetary stimulus, when the time comes to do so. The Committee recognized the risks and\nthe need to be able to adjust policy as the outlook evolves, and therefore committed to “regularly review\nthe pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming\ninformation and … adjust the program as needed.” While the outlook may not have improved enough yet\nto warrant adjusting our purchase plans in the near-term, I anticipate earnest re-evaluation as economic\ndevelopments unfold in the months ahead. That re-evaluation will be challenging, because the level of\neconomic activity, relative to pre-recession trends, may distract from the need to raise real interest rates as\nthe rate of growth improves.\n\nWe’ve come through an extraordinary period in our economic history, which in turn brought about\nextraordinary policy responses. As the signs of stronger economic performance emerge, the challenge\nbecomes determining the time and manner by which policy returns to a more normal mode of behavior.\nThe public’s confidence that policy actions are consistent with a coherent, sustainable long-term plan for\npolicy – both monetary and fiscal – will be an important factor supporting growth in the years to come.\nAs this year begins, I am hopeful that we will see progress in 2011.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Richmond Fed Economists John Weinberg and Roy Webb for help in preparing this speech.\n\n\f",

            "content": "Economic Outlook, December 2010\nCharlotte Chamber of Commerce\n2010 Economic Outlook Conference\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nDecember 6, 2010\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nIt is a pleasure to be here again this year and to be able to see some long-time friends. Many of\nyou regular attendees of this gathering are quite familiar with the background to our current\nmacroeconomic situation. For the past two years, our discussions have been concerned with the\nfinancial crisis and its aftermath, and rightfully so, since the 18-month-long recession that ended\nmid-2009 was the most severe contraction in over 70 years. Since the end of the recession, real\nGDP has grown at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, which is barely above trend and quite modest\nwhen compared to other cyclical recoveries. Moreover, that growth has been irregular, ranging as\nhigh as 5 percent to as low as 1.7 percent. Right now we are in something of a soft patch; real\nGDP grew at a below-trend 2.5 percent annual rate last quarter, and analysts are calling for\nrelatively sluggish growth in the current quarter as well.\nBefore talking about the outlook, I would like to highlight the main reasons that I believe growth\nhas been relatively sluggish so far. Before I do, however, I should note that, as always, the views\nI express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee. 1\nOne reason for the sluggishness of this recovery is the residential real estate market. The 10-year\nhousing boom that began in the mid-1990s resulted in significant overbuilding in many regions.\nAs a result, there are a large number of vacant houses that potential homebuyers may see as\nreasonable substitutes for new construction. This overhang has dampened housing activity in\nmany local markets and kept housing starts barely above a half million units at an annual rate. As\na result, residential investment has failed to make a positive contribution to growth in this\nrecovery. This contrasts with the two other severe recessions of the past 60 years, in which\nresidential investment increased an average of 40 percent in the first year of the recovery. Given\nthe significant legacy of overbuilding, unique to this recession, I do not expect housing to\ncontribute significantly to growth over the next two years.\nInvestment in nonresidential structures, such as stores, office buildings and warehouses, also has\nbeen anemic. Spending in this category fell 18 percent during the recession, and has fallen an\nadditional 17 percent since, taking four-tenths off real GDP growth. That’s par for the course\nthough, since nonresidential investment normally lags the rebound in overall economic activity.\n\n1\n\n\fWhat has been particularly striking is the behavior of household spending. In a typical recovery,\nconsumers begin to see a brighter future ahead and are willing to ramp up spending ahead of\nanticipated gains in employment and incomes. That hasn’t happened this time. Instead,\nhousehold spending increased just 1¾ percent in the first year of recovery. In contrast, after each\nof the other two severe recessions, household spending grew at an average of 6½ percent in the\nfirst year of expansion, and added more than 4 percentage points to GDP growth. Thus a major\npart of the relative weakness of this recovery can be attributed to the cautious pace of household\nspending.\nFortunately, there are a couple of brighter spots in the outlook. Business investment in equipment\nand software has grown 20 percent in real terms since the end of the recession, and there are\ngood reasons to expect that growth to continue. Technological innovations continue to provide\norganizations with new opportunities for streamlining business processes and reducing costs\nthrough productivity-enhancing investments. Moreover, the cost of capital is extremely low for a\nlarge segment of corporate America, and funds appear to be available for creditworthy firms. All\nthese factors are likely to continue to encourage new business investment going forward.\nInvestment hasn’t been the only bright spot. Exports of goods and services have grown 16\npercent since the end of the recession, adding 1¾ percent to GDP growth. This is much better\nthan in the two previous recoveries following severe recessions, in which exports were flat or\ndeclining and thus contributed little to growth. While economic growth in some of our major\ntrading partners has slowed somewhat since earlier this year – and recent developments further\ncloud the outlook for some of them – the robust expansion of many emerging economies is likely\nto continue to support U.S. export demand.\nTaken as a whole, what we’ve seen is uneven, relatively sluggish growth over the past five\nquarters. Equipment and software investment and exports have been bright spots, but residential\nconstruction has been flat and commercial construction has fallen. Consumer spending, which\naccounts for over two-thirds of GDP, is obviously key to overall growth prospects, and so far it\nhas been expanding at only a modest pace.\nMany consumers have taken steps to improve their battered financial positions. The personal\nsaving rate jumped from around 2 percent of disposable income to 6 percent during the\nrecession, and has hovered around there during the recovery. Outstanding consumer credit has\nbeen falling steadily as a result. The combination of a rising stock market and reduced debt has\nimproved household balance sheets, and has contributed to a gradual increase in the pace at\nwhich consumer spending is expanding.\nWhile stronger financial positions have helped, the extremely weak labor market has been a\nrestraining influence on consumer spending. The unemployment rate more than doubled during\nthe recession, and has only declined three-tenths of a percentage point from its peak. Given the\nmediocre pace of GDP growth, that is not surprising; it will take sustained, above-trend GDP\ngrowth for unemployment to decline meaningfully. Fortunately, we are beginning to see some\nindications of better labor market conditions, last Friday’s disappointing employment report\n\n\fnotwithstanding. For example, over the last five months the number of private-sector jobs has\nrisen by 116,000 per month. The average workweek has registered gains, and average hourly\nearnings have grown a bit faster than inflation. These all point to rising incomes, which are likely\nto bolster further growth in consumer spending.\nOne final factor contributing to the sluggishness of this recovery has been what seems to be\nunusually widespread uncertainty regarding government policies. Since the recession bottomed\nout we’ve heard forceful and impassioned complaints from many contacts in our District about\nthe dampening effect of policy changes that are in store. At first, I tended to discount these\nreports as the normal grumbling about Washington politics, but their persistence and plausibility\nhas me giving them more credence. Voluminous rule-writing is required by the health insurance\nreform legislation and the Dodd-Frank Act, and with less than a month remaining, next year’s\nmarginal tax rates are still being debated. Less widely noted are a host of changes in\nenvironmental regulations that also appear to be inhibiting firms’ willingness to commit to new\ninvestment or hiring outlays. Add to these impediments the uncertainty about when – and how –\na sustainable fiscal trajectory will be achieved, and you have the recipe for continued\napprehension and stifled risk-taking.\nSo, what lies ahead for next year? The consensus among professional forecasters is that GDP\ngrowth will strengthen to about 3 percent next year, and my own projection would be a bit\nhigher. This is a cautious outlook calling for a gradual, measured increase in the pace of\neconomic growth, and a modest decrease in unemployment. Uncertainty is likely to dissipate as\nthe regulatory picture is clarified, and I am encouraged by recent signs that some of our leaders\nseem willing to meaningfully address the looming federal fiscal imbalance. Also, in the last few\nmonths we’ve seen an improved rate of expansion in consumer spending; suggesting that\nhousehold spending will grow more rapidly in coming months as confidence regarding income\nprospects gradually improves. As a result, I expect private sector demand to pick up steam in the\nyear ahead.\nAnother reason for at least guarded optimism is that inflation is well contained. The price index\nfor personal consumption expenditures has risen 1.3 percent over the last 12 months, which is\nvery close to my own long-run objective of 1½ percent. With many commodity prices spiking,\noutright deflation is clearly even less of a risk than it was a few months ago.\nI would like to conclude by pointing out that this favorable inflation picture should not be taken\nfor granted. During the recession, the Federal Reserve cut short term interest rates to near zero\nand expanded its balance sheet from around $900 billion to over $2 trillion, which was an\nappropriate response to a major economic shock. In addition, the FOMC recently decided to\nfurther increase the Fed’s balance sheet by another $600 billion by the end of the second quarter.\nWhile this was motivated mainly by the disappointing pace of employment growth, the provision\nof further monetary stimulus at this point in the business cycle is not without risks. Historical\nexperience, including the inception of the Great Inflation of the 1970s, suggests that central\nbanks should be careful not to steer monetary policy off-course by targeting the unemployment\nrate. Moreover, if growth picks up next year, as I and many other FOMC participants expect, the\n\n\fprecautionary demand for liquidity by households, firms and banks will diminish. At some point\nwe will need to respond by reducing the provision of liquidity to the banking system to prevent\ninflation from accelerating, as it often can when a recovery picks up steam. Further balance sheet\nexpansion now could require more rapid balance sheet reduction later on, complicating the\nwithdrawal of monetary stimulus when it becomes necessary to maintain price stability. It is\nappropriate, therefore, that the FOMC has committed to “regularly review the pace of its\nsecurities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming\ninformation and will adjust the program as needed. …”\nAs we navigate monetary policy challenges in the months ahead, I remain convinced that the\nfundamental economic prospects for the country are bright. If we can make sufficient progress\non the other major policy challenges we face, I believe we can restore confidence in rising living\nstandards for generations to come.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Richmond Fed Economist Roy Web for his help in preparing this speech.\n\n\f",

            "content": "Unemployment and Monetary Policy: Lessons from Half a Century Ago\n2010 International Conference for Advanced Placement Economics Teachers\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Richmond, Virginia\nNovember 14, 2010\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nGood evening and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. For more than a decade\nnow, we have worked with the Powell Center for Economic Literacy to put on this biennial\nconference. Our purpose has been to help enhance your ability to teach students of economics\nand broaden your perspectives on current economic issues. As you know, the past few years have\nbeen a time of great challenge for the Fed, and the challenges have abated less rapidly than I had\nhoped as the economy enters the sixth quarter of the recovery. Tonight I’d like to discuss our\nmonetary policy challenges, but in light of the scholarly nature of this audience, I will draw on\nan illuminating piece of history from half a century ago. As usual, the views I express are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect the thinking of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee. 1\nEconomists use a wide range of economic statistics to define and study the business cycle. The\nofficial dating of the recessions by the National Bureau of Economic Research, for instance, is\nbased on looking for a consistent pattern of weakening (and eventually strengthening) in a broad\nset of indicators. But for most people, the single most salient measure of the state of the economy\nis the unemployment rate. This is a measure that people can relate directly to how they feel about\nthe security of their job and their income. So in addition to its direct economic implications, the\nunemployment rate can have a powerful effect on the economic and political mood of a nation.\nThe unemployment rate is currently very high. Although it has come down a bit from its peak of\nmore than 10 percent during the recession, it has remained over 9.5 percent longer than at any\ntime since the Second World War. And the consensus outlook for a relatively slow recovery in\neconomic output – growth in the 2.5- to 3-percent range in the next year – suggests that progress\ntoward more desirable rates of unemployment may continue to be slow.\n“Maximum employment” is one of the Fed’s long-term objectives and part of its so-called “dual\nmandate” from Congress. The other is price stability. Inflation recently has been quite low.\nOverall inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, has been around 1.5 percent since the middle of this year. It has been\nas high as 4.5 percent when energy prices spiked in mid-2008, and as low as minus 0.5 percent in\nmid-2009, as energy prices bottomed out. Core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and\nenergy components, has been less volatile, with year-over-year rates over the last two years\nbetween 1.8 and the most recent reading of 1.2, down from around 2.5 percent as of mid-2008.\n1\n\n\fMost monetary policymakers talk about price stability goals in terms of the low rate of inflation\nthat they would like to see achieved on average over the longer term. If monetary policymakers\ndo their jobs well, inflation will fluctuate around that rate, but deviations will be temporary and\nnot too large. I’ve stated my preference for a target rate of 1.5 percent. But many of my FOMC\ncolleagues have stated preferences for inflation a bit higher – between 1-¾ percent and 2 percent.\nThis range of views can be seen in the economic projections released by the FOMC four times a\nyear. In addition to their outlook for the inflation, growth and unemployment over the next three\nyears, FOMC participants submit their longer term projections, meaning “the rate to which each\nvariable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the\nabsence of further shocks.” In the case of inflation, these long-term projections are most\nnaturally interpreted as members’ views on the average rate of inflation that is most consistent\nwith the Fed’s statutory goals.\nThe long-term projections for unemployment are harder to interpret. While some might think of\nthem in terms of a “natural rate” of unemployment that doesn’t change very much over time,\nothers would emphasize that the attainable level of unemployment is itself a changing number\nand that, especially over the longer run, unemployment is ultimately determined by factors\nbeyond the central bank’s control. It’s interesting to note that in the Committee’s projections\nreleased after its June meeting – the most recent projections available – the range of members’\nopinions about long run unemployment is quite wide – wider than the range of their near term\nprojections. By contrast, for inflation, the range of variation is notably smaller for the long term\nprojections.\nGiven current economic conditions – with inflation running below levels viewed by most\npolicymakers as mandate consistent, and with unemployment stubbornly high as the economic\nrecovery proceeds slowly – the FOMC voted November 3 to further expand its balance sheet\nthrough the purchase of long-term U.S. Treasury securities. In its statement, the Committee\nnoted that progress toward lower employment has been “disappointingly slow.” That observation\nmakes the important distinction that it is not the high level of unemployment alone that\nmotivated the action, but rather the slow pace of improvement and the belief that further\nmonetary stimulus could help.\nThe minutes of the November meeting – which also will include a new round of participants’\neconomic projections – will provide a fuller account of the analysis that went into the decision,\nas well as elements of the debate within the Committee. 2 Rather than foreshadow the minutes,\nwhich will be released November 23, I want to use our time together to look back half a century\nto another time when the use of monetary – and fiscal – policy to fight unemployment was hotly\ndebated.\nFifty years ago, inflation was around 1.5 percent, right where it is today. In fact, inflation\naveraged just under 1.5 percent over the six years from January 1959 through December 1965. 3\nDuring that period, inflation never strayed above 1.9 percent and never fell below 0.5 percent.\nUnemployment also was high 50 years ago, although not quite as high as it is now. At the end of\nthe recession of 1960-61, the unemployment rate topped 7 percent. At the time, many economists\nwere coming to view 4 percent unemployment as the benchmark for “full employment” that\n2\n\n\fmacroeconomic policy should strive to achieve. This thinking was heavily influenced by the\nwork of Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow on the “Phillips curve” trade off in the United\nStates. 4 They interpreted the empirical correlation between price inflation and unemployment –\nin which a lower unemployment rate is associated with higher inflation – as something of a menu\nfor policymakers. In the absence of so-called “cost-push” inflation shocks, such as increases in\noil prices or business and union pricing power, lower unemployment could be achieved by\ntolerating somewhat higher inflation. The large social costs associated with unemployment were\nviewed as justifying making maximum employment the primary goal of macroeconomic policy.\nThe work of Samuelson and Solow was very influential in the Kennedy administration’s Council\nof Economic Advisors, led by Walter Heller. The 1962 Economic Report of the President\nembraced the new view, and stated that “four percent is a reasonable and prudent full\nemployment target for stabilization policy.” 5 The need for economic stimulus to reduce\nunemployment motivated the tax cut proposed by President John Kennedy in the spring of 1963.\nAfter Kennedy’s assassination in November 1963, President Lyndon Johnson pushed for early\npassage and signed it into law in February 1964. The Heller-led Council argued that it was safe\nto provide macroeconomic stimulus as long as unemployment exceeded the full employment\nmark, and generally opposed Fed tightening. Congress also pressured the Fed, arguing that rate\nincreases would “vitiate” the stimulative effects of the tax cut. 6 The Federal Reserve, led by\nChairman William McChesney Martin, felt interest rates had to rise when growth picked up in\norder to head off inflationary pressures before they emerged – a now-widely-accepted strategy\nknown as “pre-emption.”\nThe year 1965 would prove pivotal for U.S. macroeconomic history. Inflation registered 1.4\npercent as the year began, and the unemployment rate stood at 5 percent. 7 Unemployment fell to\n4 percent by the end of the year, while inflation crept up and rose above 2 percent at the\nbeginning of 1966. From there it drifted up over the remainder of the 1960s, and was not to fall\nbelow 2 percent again until early in the 1990s.\nOver the course of 1965, there was growing recognition within the FOMC of the need to tighten\npolicy. The administration began planning for a significant expansion of U.S. armed forces in\nViet Nam, and had no intention of cutting back on Johnson’s Great Society programs. The\nresulting growth in the federal deficit would be inflationary without offsetting restraint from\nmonetary or fiscal policy. Johnson delayed introducing a tax increase proposal because of\nopposition in Congress, where some preferred to cut spending on social programs. This left it up\nto the Fed to check inflation by raising interest rates. This was met with strong opposition from\nJohnson, who pressured Chairman Martin to delay any discount rate hike. In November of 1965,\nMartin felt he could hold off no longer, and the Board of Governors voted to raise the discount\nrate. This resulted in Martin’s famous visit to Johnson’s Texas ranch, where the President\nexpressed his anger in characteristically strong terms. 8\nInflation steadily deteriorated thereafter, ultimately breaching 5 percent in early 1970. As that\nhappened, the inflation rate that forecasters and market participants expected to prevail gradually\nrose as well. Unfortunately, the Fed did not act forcefully during the late 1960s to bring inflation\nback down. Johnson’s tax increase was not passed until June 1968, but was expected to have\nsignificant contractionary effects, which the Fed was pressured to offset with easier monetary\n3\n\n\fpolicy. The rise in inflation expectations made restoring price stability much more difficult. After\nMartin retired as Fed Chairman in early 1970, near the end of the 1969-70 recession, his\nsuccessor, Arthur Burns, concluded that maintaining an unemployment rate sufficiently high to\nbring down inflation would be politically intolerable, and advocated direct wage and price\ncontrols instead. A control program was adopted in late 1971, but proved ineffective, and when it\nwas dismantled the inflationary spiral resumed. It was not until the strenuous efforts of the\nVolcker FOMC after 1979 that inflation was brought back under control.\nThe history of the pursuit of full employment in the 1960s and 70s provides several important\nlessons for us now. The first is the risk of presuming that we know more than we really do about\nwhat the unemployment rate can or should be at any moment. An economy in recession is\nresponding to shocks that have disrupted the normal process of economic growth. The ability of\nthe economy to quickly reemploy its workforce may depend on the nature of the shocks and the\nnature of the adjustments businesses and households must make in order to redeploy labor and\ncapital between sectors. A permanent increase in energy prices, for instance, will shift demand\naway from energy-intensive goods and services. The required resource reallocations will be quite\ndifferent following a collapse in residential construction resulting from the buildup of a\nsubstantial oversupply of homes, which is arguably the situation we are in right now. Historical\ndata can be useful in understanding how different parts of the economy have moved together in\nresponse to various shocks, but are imprecise guides for normative judgments about whether\nunemployment is too high or too low given the most recent shocks.\nA second lesson is the danger of overemphasizing the pursuit of “maximum employment.”\nNumerous accounts from participants in the policy deliberations of the 1960s demonstrate that\nreducing unemployment was viewed as the primary objective of macroeconomic policy, and\ncontaining inflation was a secondary objective. Moreover, some academic economists advocated\na policy framework that implied that any arbitrary unemployment rate could be sustained if\nsociety was only willing to tolerate a somewhat elevated inflation rate. This is now widely\nrecognized as a fallacy, as was pointed out in 1968 by Milton Friedman, among others. 9\nMonetary policy can alter unemployment only temporarily. Trying to keep unemployment\npermanently lower than it otherwise would be, as was the objective in the second half of the\n1960s, is a recipe for continually accelerating inflation.\nA third, and related, lesson is that it can be very costly to bring inflation down once it has\nbecome elevated. As the inflation rate creeps up, consumers and businesses can start to believe\nthat monetary policy will continue to generate elevated inflation. They then build into their\ndecision making the expectation that inflation will continue. The process of restoring price\nstability and re-establishing some semblance of monetary policy credibility following the\ninflationary spiral of the 1970s was a painful and costly experience. In hindsight, it would have\nbeen far better to have prevented the initial upward creep in inflation in the first place.\nA fourth, and final, lesson is to avoid entanglements with fiscal policy. Attempting to fine-tune\nmonetary policy to offset shifts in the stance of fiscal stimulus risks subordinating monetary\npolicy to short-term political considerations, to the detriment of independence, credibility and the\nstability of inflation expectations.\n\n4\n\n\fWe may not have learned all that we can from that period in our economic history, and future\nresearch will likely continue to yield new insights. But there is broad consensus that the\nexperience of those turbulent times has improved our understanding of both the limits on the\nability of monetary policy to achieve sustained reductions in unemployment and the paramount\nimportance of preventing an erosion in inflation and inflation expectations.\nThese lessons are fully understood by the FOMC, I believe. In his speech at Jackson Hole in\nAugust, Chairman Bernanke clearly rejected the idea that the Fed should raise its inflation\nobjective, even temporarily, in the pursuit of improved employment outcomes. And the\nCommittee’s statement November 3 confirms this commitment by emphasizing its intent to\nensure that inflation remains consistent, over time, with its price stability mandate.\nSo I am confident that we can and will avoid the inflation outcomes that resulted from the flawed\npursuit of full employment a half century ago. But risks remain, especially those associated with\ninadvertently creating false expectations that the Fed is preoccupied with achieving a specific\nlevel of the unemployment rate. Our ability to manage those risks will depend on when and how\nwe choose to tighten policy, as eventually we must. To wait until unemployment reaches some\npredetermined level, as the Martin FOMC did in the 1960s, is likely to mean waiting too long.\nThat strategy proved bitterly disappointing for Martin and his colleagues, and I expect it would\nprove disappointing for us as well. At some point in the not-too-distant future, we are likely to\nface an economy growing in a self-sustaining way while the unemployment rate is still relatively\nhigh by historical standards. The decisions we make at that time will be the true test of whether\nwe’ve learned our lessons.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Robert Hetzel and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this speech.\nA lightly edited transcript of the meeting will be released in five years.\n3\nThese figures are for the price index for personal consumption expenditures.\n4\nPaul A.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, October 2010\nThe Carolina Inn, Chapel Hill, North Carolina\nOctober 13, 2010\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nIt is a pleasure to be with you tonight. I have been visiting the area for the past few days and I am\nimpressed with the knowledge and innovation that this region has to offer and the possibilities for future\ngrowth. However, I am here with you tonight to discuss the nation’s economic outlook, which, as you\nprobably know, is disappointing. As I will outline, this recovery has been more sluggish than many\nexpected, although it is worth bearing in mind that the economy is growing. As usual, but worth\nemphasizing nonetheless, the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect the thinking of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. 1\nI will begin with some background. In 2008 and the first half of 2009 we experienced our worst recession\nsince the Great Depression, as measured by the traditional gauges of depth, duration and breadth. To\nmention one, the unemployment rate more than doubled, rising from 4.4 percent in early 2007 to 10.1\npercent last fall. The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research,\nthe people that officially decide these things, recently declared that June 2009 marks the end of the\nrecession. In the four quarters following the end of the recession, real GDP rose by 3 percent, which is\npretty sluggish in comparison to other similar periods.\nWhen this recovery began, it was not obvious that growth would be this sluggish. After all, monetary and\nfiscal policies were highly stimulative, according to measures such as the level of the federal funds rate or\nthe increase in the federal budget deficit. Moreover, past recoveries have tended to be stronger following\ndeep contractions than after shallow ones.\nSo why has growth been so sluggish in this recovery? This is a difficult question to answer. For clues, I\nam going to compare the first four quarters of the current recovery, to the first four quarters of the\nrecoveries from two other very deep postwar U.S. recessions – namely, the 1974-75 recession, which\nended in the first quarter of 1975, and the 1981-82 recession, which ended in the third quarter of 1982.\nOne reason for the sluggishness of this recovery is apparent in the residential real estate market. Housing\nwas significantly overbuilt during the boom that lasted for about 10 years, beginning in the mid-1990s. As\na result there are a large number of vacant houses that are reasonably good substitutes for new\nconstruction. A recent estimate puts the number of vacant homes at 14 million nationwide. This overhang\nof unoccupied homes has put a damper on construction in many markets and has kept new housing starts\ndown around a half a million units at an annual rate. This is far below the one million or more new homes\nthat would be required each year to keep pace with the rate at which the population of new households is\ngrowing. Even though home prices appear to have stabilized, construction is likely to remain depressed\nuntil growth in population and real incomes brings the demand for the housing back in line with supply.\nThis is likely to take a good deal of time – population growth is only about one percent per year, for\nexample. In the meantime, the decentralized process underway of separating households from homes\nand/or mortgages for whom they are poorly matched will be lengthy and arduous.\nAs a result, residential investment has failed to make a positive contribution to growth in overall\neconomic activity over the past year. This contrasts with the two other severe recessions of the past 60\n\n\fyears, in which residential investment increased an average of 40 percent in the first four quarters of the\nrecovery, contributing an average of 1.3 percentage points to overall GDP growth. Putting it another way,\nif we had had a “normal” contribution from residential investment, real GDP would have grown at least\n4.3 percent in the first year of recovery, significantly more than the 3.0 percent we actually saw. Given\nthe legacy of overbuilding, I do not expect housing to contribute significantly to growth over the next\ncouple of years.\nInvestment in nonresidential structures, such as stores, office buildings and warehouses also has been an\narea of weakness. Over the last four quarters, investment in this category has fallen 15 percent, and has\nsubtracted a half percentage point from top line growth. That’s just slightly worse than average, and it is\nnot unusual for nonresidential investment to lag behind the rebound in overall economic activity.\nWhat has been unusual is the behavior of household spending. In a typical recovery, consumers see a\nbrighter future ahead and are willing to ramp up spending ahead of anticipated gains in employment and\nincomes. That hasn’t happened this time. Instead, household spending has grown just 1-⅔ percent, and\nhas added a modest 1.2 percentage points to real GDP growth over the last four quarters. In contrast, after\neach of the two other severe recessions, household spending grew at an average of 6-½ percent in the first\nyear of expansion, and has added more than 4 percentage points to growth. A major portion of the gap\nbetween growth in this recovery and growth in the recoveries following previous severe recessions is thus\nattributable, at least in an arithmetic sense, to weaker than usual household spending.\nThere are a couple of brighter spots in the outlook, however. Real business investment in equipment and\nsoftware grew 15.8 percent over the last year, and there are good reasons to expect that growth to\ncontinue. Technological innovations continue to provide organizations with new opportunities for\nstreamlining business processes and reducing costs through productivity-enhancing investments.\nMoreover, the cost of capital is extremely low for a large segment of corporate America, and funds appear\nto be readily available for creditworthy firms. And profitably has rebounded for many firms, which has\nbeen reflected in rising stock prices. All these factors are likely to continue to encourage new business\ninvestment going forward.\nInvestment hasn’t been the only bright spot. Exports of goods and services have grown 14 percent over\nthe last four quarters, adding over 1-½ percent to growth. This is far better than in the two previous\nrecoveries following severe recessions, in which exports were flat or declining and thus contributed little\nto growth. While economic growth in some of our major trading partners has slowed somewhat since\nearlier this year, the robust expansion of many emerging economies will continue to support export\ndemand.\nWhat emerges, then, from comparing the three recoveries from the most severe recessions in the postwar\nera is a mixed picture. Exports and equipment and software investment are bright spots, but home\nbuilding has been flat and government spending growth has been subpar, while consumer spending has\nbeen expanding at a relatively restrained pace.\nThe behavior of consumer spending is critical to the recovery, since it comprises two-thirds of final\ndemand. Households appear to be working hard to adjust their balance sheets by repaying debt and\nbuilding up assets. The saving rate has risen from around 2 percent in the years just before the recession,\nto a level now around 6 percent. But the saving rate has been hovering around 6 percent ever since the\nrecovery began, which implies that household spending has been growing in line with disposable income\nover that period.\n\n2\n\n\fThis points to labor market conditions as the predominant factor restraining consumer spending in this\nrecovery. Here, two features of this recovery have been widely cited as keeping labor markets from\nhealing as rapidly as they usually do following a severe downturn. One is the idea of labor market\n“mismatch,” that is, the skills required by firms that have openings are different, to a greater degree than\nusual, from the skills of workers who are looking for jobs. The mismatch hypothesis is difficult to verify\ndirectly, but it is consistent with the observation that aggregate job vacancy rates appear to have risen\ndespite the stubbornly high unemployment rate. It is also consistent with the apparent fact that\ntechnological change has been shifting labor market demand toward higher-skilled workers over time.\nA second hypothesis is that extended unemployment benefits are discouraging workers from accepting\nemployment offers. Indeed, some economists estimate that the unemployment rate would be as much as\n1-½ percent lower were it not for extended unemployment benefits. This is a sizable difference and, if\naccurate, would cast labor markets in a distinctly different light.\nMany commentators have attributed the sluggishness of the recovery to a third factor – namely, pervasive\nuncertainty regarding an array of government policies. Quantitative economic statistics alone are of little\nuse in assessing a hypothesis like this, since it has to do with the expectations and motivations of firms\nand consumers. But one part of my job is that I (and my FOMC colleagues) get to talk to a wide range\npeople and gather firsthand accounts that go beyond the usual statistics. (Indeed, that’s one of the main\npurposes of this trip to the Triangle region.) Over the course of this year we’ve heard many forceful and\nimpassioned views about the economy. There appears to be a broad feeling of apprehension that goes\nbeyond the normal grumbling about Washington or partisan political opponents. In some cases, that\nsentiment is attributable to specific regulatory actions. In West Virginia, for example, the federal\ngovernment’s wholesale withdrawal of previously issued coal mining permits has led many businesses to\nsuspend investment plans, and there are no doubt numerous other regulatory actions around the country\nthat have reduced production and employment. Part of the negative sentiment likely reflects the explosion\nof federal debt and uncertainty about how a sustainable fiscal policy will be achieved. More broadly,\npeople may be having difficulty absorbing and adjusting to three separate 2000-page pieces of federal\nlegislation that have been passed in the last two years. Add to that the continuing uncertainty about tax\nrates for 2011 (now less than three months away), business planners may be finding it more difficult than\nusual to project economic conditions or the financial implications of prospective hiring and investment\ncommitments. While it is hard to estimate the magnitude of the effects of these fears, or to disentangle\nthem from general expectations of weak demand growth, they are too broad and deep for me to dismiss as\nimplausible the notion that they have significantly dampened consumer and business spending of late.\nSo, where does the economy go from here? The consensus among professional forecasters is that growth\nwill be about 2 percent at an annual rate over the second half of this year, and will slowly gain enough\nspeed thereafter that unemployment begins to decline next year. That strikes me as a reasonably likely\nscenario, and in fact, if forced to choose right now, my forecast would lie quite close to that path.\nThis outlook is not without some risks, of course. Growth could stagnate if, for example, the policy\nuncertainty I discussed earlier intensifies. On the other hand, it is not inconceivable that uncertainty could\ndissipate and unleash a surge in investment and hiring that boosts consumer spending and growth. But I\nbelieve the most likely outcome is for growth to continue at the modest rate we have been seeing, and\ngradually accelerating next year.\nThis gradual improvement for the country as a whole should help North Carolina rebuild its own\neconomy and employment base. Relatively speaking, North Carolina’s job losses were more severe\nduring the downturn than the rest of the nation, mainly due to the concentration in manufacturing,\nconstruction, and financial services industries. Here in the Research Triangle region, unemployment\nsurpassed the highs reached in each of the three prior recessions, and (at roughly 7-½ percent) remains\n3\n\n\felevated. Because of the stabilizing presence of state government and educational institutions, as well as a\ndiverse and innovative private sector, job loss in the Raleigh-Durham area has not matched the national\ndecline, much less the state’s. Moreover, employment gains in this area, while still weak, are proceeding\nat nearly twice the national rate. So the Research Triangle region has weathered this recession better than\nmost areas of the country, and appears well positioned to take advantage of whatever support the modest\nU.S. recovery can provide.\nI’ve barely touched on monetary policy, and I’m happy to correct that omission now. First things first:\ninflation is now on target, as far as I’m concerned. Over the last 12 months the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditure has risen 1.5 percent, which is exactly what I’ve been recommending for the\nlast six years. We also track a core price index that omits volatile food and energy prices, and it is sending\nthe same message, having risen by 1.4 percent over the last 12 months. I believe that the Fed’s best\ncontribution to our nation’s economic prosperity over time would be to keep inflation stable near the\ncurrent 1.5 percent rate. But inflation has been lower this year, with overall inflation increasing at only a\n0.7 percent annual rate, which is too low for me. I would point out that these inflation numbers often run\nhot or cold for several months at a time, which is why economists focus on the 12-month number I cited a\nmoment ago. I am not yet convinced that inflation is likely to remain undesirably low. Moreover, the\npublic’s expectation of future inflation is not at such a low level; indeed, the latest survey from the\nUniversity of Michigan puts the public’s short-run inflation expectation at 2.2 percent. So I do not see a\nmaterial risk of deflation – that is, an outright decline in the price level.\nIt is worth noting that we have experienced extended periods of low inflation before without drifting into\na deflationary spiral. From January 1959 through December 1965, for example, the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures averaged 1.4 percent. It never rose above 1.9 percent, and though it\nfell to as low as 0.5 percent at one point, it never entered negative territory. In fact, not only did this\nepisode of around 1-½ percent inflation not lead to deflation, it was actually followed by a gradual\nupward drift that led into the Great Inflation of the 1970s, and inflation ultimately exceeding 10 percent.\nThe disastrous unraveling of price stability after 1965 provides an important cautionary tale, I believe. It\nis now widely recognized that tilting monetary policy toward expanding employment gave policy a\ndistinctly inflationary bias. 2 With inflation reasonably close to any plausible definition of price stability,\nand all expectations measures pointing in the right direction, making unemployment a policy imperative\nposes clear risks to the credibility of our long run inflation goals.\nIn closing, I want to note that despite the widespread expectation that near-term economic growth is likely\nto be weak by historical standards, I remain persuaded that the fundamental economic prospects for our\ncountry look bright. If we can navigate the policy turbulence ahead in a way that restores credible fiscal\nbalance and preserves the resilience and flexibility of our system, we will find and implement plenty of\nways to improve standards of living for generations to come.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nRobert L.

            "content": "EMBARGOED until President Lacker begins speaking\n“Reflections on Economics, Policy and the Financial Crisis”\nKentucky Economic Association\nFrankfort, Kentucky\nSeptember 24, 2010\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nI am deeply honored to accept this award. Although my family left the Bluegrass State\nand migrated to the northeast early in my life, I have deep family roots here. My\nGrandfather Sholto Spears grew up around Auburn, for example. So I retain a fond spot\nin my heart for My Old Kentucky Home, and I know this award would have made my\nGrandpa Sholto proud.\nIn my remarks today, I would like to share some reflections on the role of economics in\npolicy making during this financial crisis. 1 Over the last few years, I have had the\nprivilege of witnessing, and at times participating in, some of the most challenging\neconomic policy deliberations imaginable. Be under no illusions about my role, however;\nmine was a bit part at best. But my position gave me a unique vantage point on the\nmaking of policy during this financial crisis, and the fact that my teaching and research\nhad been focused on banking and financial intermediation gave me a special interest in\nthe events. I should note that these reflections are my own, however, and not necessarily\nshared by any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nWhen you think about economics and the financial crisis, one of the first things that\ncomes to mind is the claim that economists’ inability to predict this crisis represents a\nfailure for the profession. While this notion has led some to lambast mainstream\neconomics for its supposed shortcomings, the claim that economists did not foresee a\ncrisis of this sort is fallacious. As Thomas Sargent has recently pointed out, 2 economists\nsounded warnings several decades ago about the potential for troubles such as those\nwe’ve experienced. In 1983, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig published a celebrated\npaper on bank runs. 3 Their model elegantly captured the economic value of maturity\ntransformation – that is, borrowing via short term, demandable liabilities to fund longer\nterm or less liquid assets. They also showed how a financial institution performing this\nmaturity transformation function could be vulnerable to self-fulfilling “runs” in which\ninvestors who do not need the immediate return of their investment nonetheless come and\nseek it, because they conjecture that other such investors will make the same choice. 4\nMany historical episodes of financial market turmoil have been interpreted as instances of\nthis type of self-fulfilling run.\n\n1\n\n\fDeposit insurance and other forms of government-provided financial safety net protection\nare often motivated by the possibility of bank runs. Indeed, in the Diamond-Dybvig\nmodel, government deposit insurance completely eliminates the run equilibrium. But in a\n1978 article, John Kareken and Neil Wallace pointed out that deposit insurance gives\ninsured banks and thrifts an incentive to take on socially excessive amounts of risk and\ndampens their creditors’ incentive to monitor and constrain such risk-taking. 5 Several\nyears later, Kareken wrote about the critical role of regulation and supervision in\nconstraining the excessive risk-taking incentives that result from deposit insurance. 6 He\nwarned of the dangers of deregulating such institutions before commensurately\nstrengthening the supervisory regime to be able to contain the expanded bank and thrift\nrisk-taking capabilities. More recently, former Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern and\nhis then-colleague Ron Feldman, in a 2004 book, warned about the distorted risk-taking\nincentives at large financial institutions that were viewed as Too Big to Fail, the title of\ntheir volume. In 2002, Richmond Fed economists John Walter and John Weinberg\nestimated that at the end of 1999 about 45 percent of U.S. financial sector liabilities\nbenefited from either explicit or implicit government guarantees. 7 At around the same\ntime William Poole warned specifically about the moral hazard dangers posed by Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac, who were privately owned but widely viewed as implicitly\nguaranteed by the U.S. government. 8 As Chairman Bernanke has observed, “There is\nlittle doubt that excessive risk-taking by too-big-to-fail firms significantly contributed to\nthe crisis, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac being prominent examples.” 9\nBecause the implicit component of the federal financial safety net is discretionary, in\ncontrast to explicitly legislated guarantees such as deposit insurance, policymakers face\nan acute time consistency problem, which my former colleague Marvin Goodfriend and I\nwrote about in 1999. 10 Committing ex ante to well-defined limits on government support\nwould enhance market discipline and strengthen private incentives to limit risk-taking.\nBut in the event of financial distress, pressures can emerge to alleviate ex post\ninefficiency, even if that would be inconsistent with an ex ante optimal plan. Responding\nto those pressures sets precedents that erode market discipline and contribute to the next\ncrisis. 11 In my experience, this tension between ex post and ex ante perspectives on\npolicy choice – this time consistency problem – is what makes policymaking particularly\nexcruciating in a financial crisis.\nThese three economic forces – the potential fragility associated with maturity\ntransformation, the moral hazard associated with explicit government guarantees, and the\ntime consistency dilemma associated with ambiguous implicit guarantees – are central to\nunderstanding the narrative of the financial crisis. Financial institutions that benefitted\nfrom implicit government guarantees – notably Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and several\nEuropean banking institutions – fueled the demand for securities backed by risky\nsubprime mortgages. The implicit support of these government-sponsored entities (GSEs)\nled them and their creditors to underweight tail risk which in turn distorted incentives for\na broad range of participants in the distribution chain, from credit rating agencies to\noriginators to loan brokers. The resulting oversupply of subprime mortgage lending\ncontributed to over appreciation in home prices and overinvestment in new housing.\nMaturity transformation outside of traditional deposit banking made many financial firms\n2\n\n\fvulnerable to runs when their exposure to unanticipated mortgage-related losses was\nsuspected. Ambiguity about the extent and likelihood of safety net support meant that\ndeclining to rescue would cause investors to pull away from other similar financial firms.\nPolicymakers faced agonizing choices between bad precedents that would weaken market\ndiscipline and the financial market fallout of rapidly realigning investor expectations\nregarding future government support.\nThe literature on these three ideas provided fair warning, I believe, that the pre-crisis\nregime of constructive ambiguity was capable of generating consequential risk-taking\nexcesses and significant financial market problems. Nevertheless, economists were\nunable predict the time and manner in which the crisis would play out, although a few\nvocal individuals foretold some sort of imminent crisis more or less continuously. The\npainful process of watching the financial crisis unfold revealed several implications that\nhad not been appreciated beforehand. The U.S. housing GSEs and their low-income\ncredit mandates exerted a larger influence on the subprime mortgage market than was\nknown ex ante. The dollar-denominated intermediation activities of European financial\ninstitutions, particularly maturity transformation, were more consequential than expected.\nThe so-called shadow banking system was not a parallel universe unto itself, but instead\ndepended critically on backstop liquidity support, both contractual and reputational, from\nlarge banking organizations, whose access to the safety net made them more willing to\naccept tail risk. That in turn meant that large subprime losses unexpectedly boomeranged\nback onto the balance sheets of bank holding companies. Perhaps most importantly, the\nmagnitude of the overinvestment in housing collectively generated by these sources of\nmoral hazard was underestimated and emerged only gradually as the fall in residential\ninvestment unfolded. As a result, until the fourth quarter of 2008, a range of mainstream\nmacroeconomic forecasts underestimated the depth of the recession.\n***\nI have been discussing the economics of the buildup to the crisis, but what about the\nunfolding of the crisis itself? The financial market turmoil that began in August of 2007\nposed tough challenges for central bank policy economists. The logic of the DiamondDybvig fragility result was an ever present and at times urgent concern, and motivated\nvigilant attention to firms that were vulnerable to run-like behavior because they were\nengaged in maturity transformation. Because government insurance for the liabilities of a\nDiamond-Dybvig intermediary can eliminate run equilibria, their model appeared to\nrecommend official intervention to prevent the spread of runs. But as investor confidence\nin large financial institutions fluctuated, it became clear to supervisors that the extent to\nwhich a financial entity was vulnerable to runs was a matter of business strategy choice –\nthat is, it was endogenous. Liquid, short-term borrowings were less costly than longerterm funding that more closely matched the maturity of the borrower’s underlying assets.\nThus intervention decisions required facing non-trivial trade-offs involving ex ante moral\nhazard, a feature Diamond and Dybvig deliberately left out of their model. 12 Moreover,\nthe contractual mechanisms that in a Diamond-Dybvig model allows a bank to prevent\nrun equilibria – partial suspension, or ex post trading, for example – seem quite feasible\nin modern financial markets. In addition, a sizable empirical and theoretical literature\n3\n\n\fviews runs as driven by fluctuating expectations regarding the fundamental value of the\nintermediary’s assets, rather than by arbitrary herd behavior (that is, sunspots), in which\ncase a run may represent an ex ante efficient method of initiating liquidation in the\nappropriate states of the world. So while the Diamond-Dybvig model provided an\nilluminating framework for interpreting tumultuous events in financial markets, it did not\nprovide unequivocal guidance for policymakers contemplating intervention, because not\nall runs represent inefficient instability.\nOther models of inherent financial fragility also played a role in policy deliberations. For\nexample, in August 2007 investors began pulling away from asset-backed commercial\npaper instruments out of concern that the underlying portfolios might be exposed to\nsubprime mortgage losses. 13 Issuance volumes dropped and prices fell, and the notion of\n“fire sales” or “cash-in-the-market pricing” was invoked as an explanation for financial\nassets trading at prices well below fundamentals, or not trading at all. 14 Crucial to such\nmodels, however, are barriers to market participation that prevent the obvious arbitrage\noperations. It was hard to find such barriers in the asset-backed securities market,\nhowever, given the wide array of institutional investors that had access to those securities\nand many other markets as well. Moreover, on-balance sheet funding costs for the\nsponsoring institutions were often lower than that implied by crisis-level market risk\npremia, which could explain the precipitous drop in issuance. It was difficult to reject the\nhypothesis that in response to legitimately elevated uncertainty about subprime mortgage\nloss exposures, a broad range of investors had marked down asset valuations and shifted\ninto cash. Under this hypothesis, depressed asset prices represented reduced\nfundamentals, and official intervention would impede rather than aid market functioning.\nThis example illustrates a broader lesson regarding the use of economic models in\nfinancial policy. The formal economics of financial fragility is still in its infancy. What\nthe economics literature provides is a collection of intriguing “possibility theorems”\nshowing that a particular financial market phenomenon could potentially occur under a\ngiven set of assumptions. Some models of financial fragility rationalize activist\nintervention policies, while some models with identical price and quantity implications\nsuggest that observed arrangements may be fairly efficient. Policymakers are thus faced\nwith alternative models with very different policy implications. Constructive policy\ndeliberations require that you “lay all your cards on the table” by checking the entire\nrange of model characteristics against real world observations, both qualitative and\nquantitative.\nFinancial policy making thus places a premium on careful and objective reporting. I\nbelieve that was made more difficult by the type of language often used to describe\nfinancial market conditions. At various times we learned that a financial market was\n“strained,” “stressed,” “under liquidity pressures,” “dysfunctional,” “frozen,” “clogged,”\nor “had seized up.” While this market terminology is certainly vivid and undoubtedly\nhelped convey the discomfort of some market participants, particularly on the sell side, I\nnever found any of these terms all that helpful, because all they really conveyed was that\nprices and traded quantities were low or even at zero. They could be inefficiently low due\nto some market imperfection, or they could be efficiently low because buyers’\n4\n\n\fexpectations regarding the asset’s fundamentals are depressed. Without a candidate\nmodel in hand of how that asset market functions, such colorful slang says nothing about\npolicy questions.\n***\nI’d like to close by focusing on the time consistency problem, which I believe was the\ncentral tension in the financial crisis. I also believe that shifting investor beliefs about the\ngovernment’s intention to provide or limit support was a leading source of contagion and\nmarket volatility in a number of key episodes – especially during the weeks in\nSeptember, 2008, that saw distinctly different treatments of Lehman Brothers, American\nInternational Group Inc. (AIG), Washington Mutual Inc., and the former Wachovia Corp.\nThe difficult dilemmas that policy makers faced in the fall of 2008 were in part the legacy\nof a financial safety net policy that ultimately proved unworkable. Often referred to as\n“constructive ambiguity,” this approach encouraged financial firms and their creditors to\nbehave as if they were not protected – by not publicly acknowledging implicit support –\nwhile policymakers actually were standing ready to act in a crisis. 15 Constructive\nambiguity essentially sought to obtain the ex ante benefits of commitment without giving\nup the discretion to act freely ex post. While constructive ambiguity was never formally\nadopted by name as official policy, I believe it is a fair description of the approach to\npolicy followed in the decades since the Continental Illinois bail out. 16\nUltimately, of course, constructive ambiguity is bound to be defeated by rational\nexpectations. Even if you don’t accept rational expectations in its strongest forms, it\nseems clear that a policy that relies on people being systematically and persistently wrong\nabout how the government will behave in a crisis has little chance of imposing effective\nmarket discipline on risk-taking.\nThe experience of the last three years should finally put an end to the notion of\nconstructive ambiguity as a plausible approach to financial stability. The Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in many ways reflects recognition of\nthis fact. In the debates leading up to the Act’s passage, all sides stressed the need to\ncredibly end bailouts of large financial institutions.\nUltimately, there are two ways to achieve the long-term benefits of commitment. One is\nto impose legal constraints limiting policymakers’ actions. The other is for the\npolicymaker to seek, through actions and communications, to establish and maintain a\nreputation for a particular decision rule. This approach worked well in bringing down\ninflation in the 1980s, but whether it can work for financial safety net policy – or more\nprecisely, the extent to which it can work – is an open question. My sense is that,\ncombined with improvements to regulation, it can and ultimately must be part of an\neffective approach to financial stability.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act presents a golden opportunity for a regime change that leaves\nbehind the dangers of constructive ambiguity. But the Act embodies two contradictory\n5\n\n\fapproaches to resolving the time consistency dilemma. On one hand, it sharply constrains\nand strengthens accountability around government funded rescues of financial firms,\nwhich would tend to limit instances of intervention. 17 On the other hand, it also provides\nmore discretionary tools to intervene to prevent the ex post distress associated with\nbankruptcy, which would tend to exacerbate the time consistency problem. Reducing\nfinancial instability will require clarity and commitment.\nAs for economics, my hope is that policymakers can make better use of it next time\naround. For this it would help if work on models of financial fragility moves beyond\npossibility theorems and begins to confront models with facts in a systematic way. And\nfor their part, policymakers must confront head-on the tensions of the time consistency\nproblem.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg for help in preparing this speech.\nRemarks at the American Economic Association panel discussion titled “Why Did Economists Not\nPredict the Crisis?” January 5, 2010.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, July 2010\nJuly 15, 2010\nHampton Roads Virginia Regional Forum\nNorfolk, Va.\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nIt’s a pleasure to discuss the economic outlook tonight. I think the most useful tack to take to get started is\nto survey the broader economic context, and then set our sights on some of the supporting details. For the\nlast year or so, we have been recovering from a very severe recession, and despite the unique features of\nthe contraction, this recovery resembles many that we’ve seen in the past; some sectors are expanding,\nwhile some sectors are still struggling. Signs of strength are evident in manufacturing, business\nequipment investment and consumer spending, while weakness persists in the labor market, construction,\nand state and local government spending. And as was the case in many past recoveries, this one is\nproceeding at an uneven pace; growth was quite strong in the fourth quarter, but more moderately paced\nover the last two quarters. Thankfully, inflation has remained low and fairly stable. The most likely\nscenario is for this pattern to continue – that is, for the recovery to continue at a pace that is generally\nmoderate, but variable over time and across sectors. That’s the broad aerial view, and now I’d like to\ncome down to sea level to get a closer look at some of the particulars. I’ll be speaking mainly about the\nnational outlook, with occasional comments about the Hampton Roads region. Before I begin, I should\nmention that these are my own views and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee. 1\nThe evidence that overall economic activity has been expanding since the middle of last year is\nwidespread. Real GDP, for example, appears to have grown more than 3 percent over the last four\nquarters, which is a bit above its long-run trend.2 Granted, some of the increase was due to one-time\nfactors. Last year’s fiscal stimulus measures, for example, have boosted incomes and production over the\nlast year, but those effects are set to diminish over the next few quarters. And due to the way GDP is\ncalculated, it received an additional one-time boost from the completion in mid-2009 of the sharp\ninventory reduction that is typical of recessions. Demand since then has been met entirely from\nproduction, which is what GDP measures, rather than by drawing down inventories.\nA look at the major components spending, however, supports the idea that we’re on course for sustainable\ngrowth. Let’s start by taking a look at consumers. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds\nof total spending in the GDP, and is now clearly on an upswing. During the recession – that is, in 2008\nand the first half of 2009 – real consumer spending fell at a 1.2 percent annual rate. But in the last half of\n2009, consumer spending increased at a 2.4 percent annual rate, and so far this year it has grown at a 2.9\npercent rate. That turnaround is likely to be durable, in my view. During a severe recession consumers\ntighten up on spending, in part due to actual job losses and lower incomes, but also due to their\nweakening confidence in future income growth. Many households prudently defer major purchases when\nthe headlines are alarming and jobs are threatened. But when the bad news begins to crest, a growing\nnumber of households begin to become more confident in their job security. That confidence and\nimproving prospects for income growth allow many consumers to begin to satisfy some of their pent-up\ndemand for big-ticket items and discretionary purchases, which boosts overall consumer spending.\nAlthough unexpected adverse shocks to household income prospects have the potential, as always, to set\nthis process back, the baseline outlook for consumer spending suggests that reasonably healthy growth\nwill be sustained in the months ahead.\n\n\f2\nThe brighter picture is not limited to consumers. Business investment in equipment and software usually\ndisplays large swings in recessions and recoveries, and the latest experience fits that pattern very well.\nAfter falling at nearly a 15 percent average annual rate during the recession, this investment category\ngrew slowly in the third quarter last year and then rose at a 15.2 percent annual rate in the next two\nquarters. Again, prudent firms often defer capital spending in recessions, which creates a pent-up demand\nthat boosts spending early in recoveries. And while sales may have fallen in many industries, technology\ncontinues to advance, and as a result there’s an array of opportunities to deploy new capital to improve\nbusiness processes. Major upgrades for IT and communications equipment are underway at many firms.\nSo along with most analysts I expect to see robust increases in spending for business equipment and\nsoftware this year – and beyond.\nThe broad growth in business and consumer spending has had a clear impact on the supply side of the\neconomy. In manufacturing we have seen a sizeable swing in activity. Industrial production fell almost 15\npercent during the recession. Since June of last year, though, it has risen in 10 of 11 months for a\ncumulative gain of 9 percent through May. That turnaround is evident in consumer goods, especially\nautos; business equipment, especially computers and semiconductors; and even the production of\nconstruction supplies has begun to increase.\nProducers of goods and services also have been aided by the pickup in growth among our major trading\npartners since the first half of last year. Exports fell sharply in the recession, with the pace of decline\nhitting a 30 percent annual rate early last year. But since the end of the recession, exports have risen at a\nhealthy 17 percent annual rate. Recent developments in Europe have called into question the extent to\nwhich growth there will support demand for our exports. At this point, my sense is that uncertainty\nregarding fiscal adjustments and banking conditions is likely to be resolved without major effects on U.S.\ngrowth, although, to be fair, more adverse outcomes are conceivable. Here in the Hampton Roads area,\nthe fluctuations in export activity are clearly visible at the ports as well as at the trucking and rail\nconnections that serve them. The volume of container units through the Port of Virginia weakened during\n2008 and declined even further, by 17 percent, during 2009. Container activity has rebounded in the first\nhalf of this year, and has recently returned to pre-recession levels.\nNot every sector of the economy has the wind at its back, however. While positive overall growth in\neconomic activity does mark the beginning of a recovery, typically some sectors continue to contract even\nas others expand. For example, spending on nonresidential construction – a category that includes stores,\noffices, warehouses and other structures – has fallen almost 30 percent over the last year and a half.\nAlthough there are scattered reports of bottoming out in some commercial markets, leading indicators for\nthis sector, including architectural billings and vacancy rates, suggest that nonresidential construction will\ncontinue to be very soft for an extended period.\nAnd then there’s residential construction, and everyone knows the background here. We had an extreme\nboom-bust cycle in housing, as the number of new housing starts rose from 1.4 million in 1995 to 2.1\nmillion in 2005 before falling to 554,000 last year. For perspective, last year’s number is about half of\nwhat it would take to accommodate population growth with an unchanged homeownership rate. During\nthe boom we built more houses – and larger houses – than we ended up wanting. So there are now more\nthan 14 million vacant homes in the country, and population growth and demolitions will only reduce\nvacancies slowly. It will take some time to plow through the loan modifications, foreclosures and market\ntransactions needed to achieve a more appropriate match between households, homes and mortgages.\nLooking ahead, one shouldn’t count on housing construction to expand much from its current sluggish\npace. Indeed, in the Hampton Roads region, annual permitting activity for single-family homes peaked in\n2003 before declining by 65 percent through 2009. Regional housing prices peaked in late 2007 and have\n\n\f3\nfallen by 10 percent since then. Although national housing prices peaked earlier in 2007, the subsequent\ndecline was similar in magnitude. Housing activity in the region remains weak and recent trends have\nbeen somewhat skewed by the expiration of the homebuyers tax credit.\nState and local government spending also has been weak lately, for obvious reasons. This category in the\nnational income accounts has fallen 1.7 percent in real terms since the second quarter of last year,\npartially offsetting the considerable increase in federal spending since the recession began. With revenue\nfor many state and local governments in the doldrums, budgets are likely to remain quite constrained for\nsome time.\nBut even after taking on board these sectors where activity is still soft, I believe that consumer spending\nand business investment are going to continue to be strong enough to keep growth in overall activity on\nan upward trajectory, though perhaps at a pace that is less robust than has been typical of past recoveries.\nAs a result, I would not be surprised to continue to see somewhat choppy economic reports for a time. For\nexample, spending measures came in better than expected early in the year, but have underperformed of\nlate. This pattern is not at all inconsistent with moderate growth – one can’t always be better than\nexpected, after all – so it’s wise not to overreact to every crosscurrent in the data flow.\nThe labor market is another sector where reports were stronger than expected earlier in the year. This was\nwelcome news, since we lost 7.3 million jobs during the recession, and then lost an additional 1.1 million\njobs in the last half of 2009, while GDP and manufacturing production were increasing. Many analysts\nhave noted, however, that some of this year’s job growth has been attributable to temporary hiring for the\nDecennial Census, and that private payroll growth has been slower over the last two months than the\nprevious two months. This is correct, but it is important to note that as you look through the choppiness,\nprivate payrolls have been expanding at a significant pace – over 1.1 percent at an annual rate since\nDecember. This is more than what is required to keep up with growth in the working age population,\nwhich is part of the reason the unemployment rate has fallen from 10.1 percent, when it peaked last\nOctober, to 9.5 percent in June. This is still quite elevated, however, which indicates just how much\nground remains to be covered.\nThe labor market in the Hampton Roads region has been recovering in line with the national labor market,\nwith the addition of 8,200 jobs during the first five months of 2010. This gain provides only a partial\nrecovery of the 33,000 jobs lost since the beginning of the recession. The fact that the unemployment rate\nfor the Hampton Roads region peaked at 8 percent earlier this year suggests that this labor market was not\nhit quite as hard as the rest of the country, although the current rate of 7.3 percent is more than double the\npre-recession rate and remains stubbornly high.\nCredit market conditions have been central to the story of the recession and the recovery. Conditions\ntightened sharply as the recession began, and have improved considerably since the middle of last year as\nthe economic outlook improved. Still, I regularly hear complaints about small businesses being unable to\nobtain credit. It is certainly true that there are banks and other lenders who have experienced large losses\nand are now facing a relatively high cost of capital. Those lenders are now reducing their outstanding\nloans, and firms that have traditionally borrowed from these now-capital-constrained lenders may have\ndifficulty getting new loans, or even retaining existing credit lines. But many banks appear to be ready\nand able to lend to creditworthy customers – that’s what banking is all about. So while borrowers may\nneed to shop around more in this environment, my sense is that the credit market is working well enough\nto support productive investment and allow a solid recovery to proceed.\nThe economic picture would not be complete without some comment on inflation. Since the surge of\nearly 2008, inflation has fallen, and over the last 6 months both overall and core inflation have averaged\n\n\f4\nabout 1 percent at an annual rate. While I wouldn’t like to see these numbers move much lower, our best\navailable measures of inflation expectations have been relatively stable, which suggests that, barring\nunanticipated shocks, inflation is likely to drift upward in coming quarters.\nThe stability of inflation expectations implies confidence that the Federal Reserve will act to keep\ninflation low and stable as the recovery continues and the economy improves. Living up to that\nconfidence will make monetary policy challenging for the foreseeable future. Current policy settings are\nstill at emergency levels, with the federal funds rate near zero and with our balance sheet two-and-a-half\ntimes the size it was three years ago. These settings are now providing substantial monetary stimulus to\nthe economy. As a technical matter, whenever we decide to begin normalizing policy it will be\nstraightforward to sell assets, shrink our balance sheet, and raise the level of short-term interest rates. The\ndifficulty, of course, is that no one wants to tighten policy prematurely and needlessly dampen the\nrecovery. So recognizing the right time to begin normalizing our monetary policy settings is going to be\nhard, and reasonable people can differ about this. For my part, I will be looking for the time at which\neconomic growth is strong enough and well enough established to warrant raising our policy rate.\nA broader economic policy challenge we face as a nation is the path of federal deficits that will result\nfrom current and planned fiscal policies. In my view, if economists can contribute anything to the policy\nprocess, it’s our willingness to identify unsustainable trends and remind people that they don’t go on\nforever. And clearly, our current fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path. The Congressional Budget\nOffice estimates that under current legislation, by 2012 the federal debt as a fraction of GDP will have\nmore than doubled in 10 years, with further increases occurring each year unless major changes are made\nin spending programs and taxes. Granted, the fiscal situation is even worse in some other countries, but I\ndon’t think we want to find out how close we can get to a full-blown fiscal crisis before taking corrective\nactions.\nIn broad terms we all know what needs to be done – cut spending or raise taxes. If we don’t, an adverse\nsequence of events will be set in motion. Investors will be increasingly reluctant to hold more Treasury\nsecurities, yields will consequently rise significantly, the cost of capital will increase for firms producing\nin the United States, capital formation will suffer, productivity growth will slow, and thus real household\nincomes will stagnate. In short, the well-being of future generations is at stake. My hope is that\npolicymakers will find a way to move fairly quickly to make the adjustments needed to put the budget on\na sustainable path. The sooner we make the necessary adjustments, the longer the period over which we\ncan spread out the adjustment cost, and the more likely we are to avoid a fiscal crisis of the type Greece is\nnow experiencing.\nDespite these serious policy challenges, however, I remain fundamentally optimistic about the capacity of\nthe American economy to generate sustained improvements in standards of living. Our country has\nrepeatedly demonstrated an unsurpassed ability to generate technological and organizational innovations\nand deploy them to deliver improved products and services for consumers and businesses. While we have\nstruggled from time to time with economic policy, and no doubt will continue to struggle in the years\nahead, that should not distract us from our signal achievements, nor should it dim our hope for the future.\n1\n2\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for assistance in preparing this speech.\nSecond quarter 2010 GDP has yet to be released.\n\n\f",

And thank you all for coming out for this special media sneak preview\nof our new educational exhibit. We are very excited about unveiling our exhibit today,\nbecause we've put a lot of time and thought into it. We're very happy you could join us,\n\n\fbecause we hope you can help carry the word to many Americans about what The Fed\nExperience is all about.\nI'll say a few words in a minute about the thinking behind our new exhibit, but let me\nunderscore something at the outset that this exhibit signi�es, so it doesn't get overlooked.\nThis is Main Street; not Wall Street; not Capitol Hill. For those of you who may not have had\nyour second cup of co�ee yet, let me rephrase it — we are standing in the lobby of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond, located in the central business district of an average\nAmerican city — the proverbial Main Street, America, if you will. What I want to emphasize\nis that we, and our sister Federal Reserve Banks across the country, are the Fed's\nconnection to Main Street and the American people.\nFor some of you that hail from around here, this may be fairly obvious. But for those of you\nwho have traveled a ways to be with us today, some from as far as Washington, D.C., our\nday-to-day work on behalf of our region is sometimes lost in the heated rhetoric about \"the\nFed\" in connection with the �nancial crisis and �nancial regulatory reform.\nSo I am especially grateful that you have taken the time to visit our Bank and acquire a\ndeeper understanding of what we do. Those of you with fond memories of our old Money\nMuseum, with its cases of notes and coins, you will �nd so much more here. But I hope all\nof you come away from this event seeing the Fed Experience as a proactive e�ort to help\nAmerican citizens understand the economy and their nation's central bank.\nI have been Bank President for almost six years now, and during that time many of you\nhave heard me speak on a broad range of topics. Most frequently, though, you have heard\nme discuss national and regional economic conditions, the Fed's important role in\nmaintaining price stability, and factors that can a�ect the growth over time in the health\nand wellbeing of households, communities, businesses and the nation as a whole.\nToday, you have an opportunity to see these concepts at a fundamental level, thru an\nexperience — we call it The Fed Experience. One core purpose of The Fed Experience is to\nprovide opportunities to explore and understand the way price stability contributes to the\nprocess by which innovations in areas such as technology, healthcare and transportation\nare translated into improvements in the quality of life for a family, a community — and\nultimately a nation. The e�ectiveness of that process depends critically on how well\npotential innovators understand what society needs most. That depends on an e�ective\nprice system to provide people with the appropriate signals and incentives. And for that,\nmonetary stability is absolutely essential.\nThose of you who write about business and consumer issues know that \"the economy\" is\nan abstract and elusive concept for many readers. But you also know that economic\noutcomes are in the end the result of a series of economic choices made over time by\nindividual households and businesses. So a second core purpose of The Fed Experience is to\nprovide visitors with opportunities to learn �rst-hand how their choices contribute to a\nhealthy, growing economy. The individual choices people make every day — about things\n\n\flike which clothes to buy, which movies to see or which college to attend — a�ect both our\npersonal well-being as well as the local economy. To paraphrase a venerable old comic strip\ncharacter, we want people to come away with the sense that \"we have met the economy\nand it is us.\"\nAs America's central bank, we believe it is our mission to help improve the public's capacity\nto make e�ective economic and �nancial choices. So a third core purpose of The Fed\nExperience is to provide people of all ages with some practical insight into how their choices\na�ect their well-being over time. We believe that this is vitally important, given the\nincreasing complexity of today's marketplace, especially the �nancial marketplace.\nWith the o�cial opening of this exhibit tomorrow, we hope to enhance the connections\nbetween the Bank and the local communities we serve. These connections have evolved\nsubstantially over the years as the economy and our role in it have evolved. We have\ncontinually grown our educational outreach e�orts in the Fifth District over the last several\ndecades, and we have stepped up those e�orts signi�cantly in the wake of recent events.\nWe are optimistic that in opening our doors to the public once again, we will provide a\nbetter understanding of who we are and what we do for America's economy.\nAgain, it is a great pleasure to open our doors to you today.

            "content": "The Regulatory Response to the Financial Crisis: An Early Assessment\nMay 26, 2010\nThe Institute for International Economic Policy and the International Monetary Fund Institute\nWashington, D.C.\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nIt’s a pleasure to join you today. Before I begin, I should mention that these are my own views\nand are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. 1\nI would like to start with an explanation of my title: “The Regulatory Response to the Financial\nCrisis: An Early Assessment.” First, I intend to construe the phrase “regulatory response”\nbroadly to include all official responses, both those that came during the crisis and those that\nhave followed. And second, the word “early” in the subtitle may be surprising. After all, we are\nnearly three years removed from the first signs that a broad-based financial crisis was upon us, a\ncrisis to which central banks and governments around the world have responded with\nunprecedented interventions and plans for revamping regulatory regimes. We also are a year past\nthe conclusion of the so-called “stress test” of major U.S. banks that assessed the sufficiency of\ntheir capital in the event of further deterioration of economic conditions. But I would put the\ncurrent period in perspective by noting that just in the last two decades scholars have uncovered\nnew insights about the efficacy of policy actions during the Great Depression, which ended\nseven decades ago. So by that measure, we still may be fairly early on in the assessment process.\nAmong the new insights regarding the Great Depression is that policy errors, both in monetary\npolicy and in attempts to control wages and prices, contributed to the severity and length of the\nproblems experienced in that decade. Policy actions are inevitably based on theory – some\nimplicit or explicit notion of the nature of the problem and the way in which particular actions\nwill help or hurt the situation. Policy actions during the Great Depression that, in retrospect,\nappear to have been errors were based on the well-meaning application of flawed theories.\nMonetary policymakers applied the wrong model to the economic and financial market\nconditions they observed, 2 and government interventions in wage and price setting were\nmotivated by a misunderstanding of the potential macroeconomic consequences. 3 The decades\nwe have spent delving deeper into the lessons offered by the Great Depression should serve as a\ncautionary tale regarding the value of careful attention to the theories underlying official actions\ntaken during this crisis and to plausible alternative theories that might have had different\nimplications. My sense is that, as in the case of the Great Depression, the ultimate assessment of\nofficial response in this crisis will depend critically on whether future historians judge\npolicymakers to have acted on an appropriate theory of the case.\nThree underlying premises appear to have shaped policy response during this financial crisis.\nFirst, that markets are prone to the build-up of excessive (that is, inefficiently large) risk,\n1\n\n\fresulting from an externality – financial market participants do not take into account the\n“systemic” consequences of their risk-taking actions. Second – and perhaps as a consequence of\nthe first – markets are subject to panicked flights from particular asset classes or counterparties.\nAgain, the excessiveness of such actions stems from an assumption that, in pulling away from a\ncounterparty, investors do not consider (that is, inefficiently underweight) the “systemic”\nconsequences of that action. Third, the provision of public sector credit at the onset of a crisis,\neither from the central bank or the government, can prevent or ameliorate adverse consequences\n(that is, can improve efficiency, at least from an ex post point of view).\nCollectively, these assumptions imply that market discipline will provide an inadequate check on\nrisk-taking and the likelihood of panics will be undesirably elevated. So, on the front-end – that\nis, before a crisis occurs – regulatory oversight needs to control risk-taking. Viewed through this\ntheoretical lens, the experience of the last three years would seem to suggest that these flaws are\nlarger than we thought. The lesson then would be that we need to strengthen our ability to\nmonitor financial system risks and respond with appropriate supervisory constraints on financial\nmarket participants. While I agree with this conclusion, I arrive by a different route – that is, a\ndifferent theory about the causes of excessive risk-taking.\nFirst, I am skeptical of the characterization of systemic risk as an externality that leads market\nparticipants to undervalue or ignore risks. Those spillovers are usually ascribed to the\ninterconnectedness that is said to be more prevalent among financial firms. But those\ninterconnections are all the result of mutually agreed-upon contracts. Creditors have voluntarily\nchosen their counterparties, and they have no inherent reason to neglect the implied exposure to\ntheir counterparties’ counterparties. Similarly, financial asset owners have voluntarily agreed to a\nrange of potential returns, and they have no inherent reason to neglect any particular possibilities.\nInterconnectedness, by itself, is not a market failure.\nSkepticism is also warranted, I believe, regarding the systemic consequences of an individual\nfirm’s failure, no matter how interconnected. Arguments that one firm’s failure can spark costly\nruns at other firms rely on the logic of panics as self-fulfilling prophecies. While this logic is\ncorrect as far as it goes, it provides an unsatisfactory guide for policymakers, because it does not\nprovide a means for determining whether creditors are justified in pulling away from other firms.\nAfter all, news that one firm has failed can be genuinely informative about fundamental\nprospects at other firms with similar exposures.\nI do think there is a fundamental deficiency in the way our financial markets have performed.\nAnd you could describe this deficiency as an externality that leads both to the overexposure to\nrisks in the financial system and to contagious reactions of markets to problems at one\ninstitution. But this externality is the product of government policy – namely, the provision of\ngovernment protection to creditors through an ambiguous, implicit financial safety net. The\nwidespread belief that some financial firms are too big or too “systemically important” to fail\nand their creditors will benefit from government support increases those firms’ appetite for risk.\nIn this setting, allowing a firm to fail creates contagion by forcing market participants to adjust\ntheir beliefs about the extent of future government protection. 4\n\n2\n\n\fA compelling alternative premise, one that I personally believe is most likely to emerge as the\nconsensus assessment among future scholars, is that the incentives created by the financial safety\nnet were the chief cause of the financial crisis. Richmond Fed economists have conservatively\nestimated that in 1999, 18 percent of the U.S. financial sector was covered, or believed to be\ncovered, by the implicit safety net. 5 Another 27 percent received explicit protection such as\ndeposit insurance, meaning that a total of 45 percent of financial sector liabilities benefited from\nexplicit or implicit government safety net support. The implicit coverage was accounted for\nalmost entirely by the housing government sponsored entities (GSEs) and several large\ncommercial banks – all of which were important players in the build-up of risks related to\nhousing finance over the last decade.\nThe involvement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in housing finance set them up for a central\nrole in the financial crisis. Their hybrid mission of supporting social home-ownership goals and\nproviding returns to their shareholders, when combined with the perception that their debt was\ngovernment-backed, made it almost inevitable that they would over-leverage. Estimates of their\npurchases and guarantees of high-risk mortgages from 2002 to 2007 range from a third to a half\nof total high-risk issuance. 6\nThe role of large U.S. banks in the run-up to the crisis was a bit more indirect, but potentially\nconsequential nonetheless. Most subprime and Alt-A mortgages were originated outside of the\ncommercial banking system, but the process through which mortgage risks were re-intermediated\ninvolved banks in several key steps. Many of these mortgages found their way into off-balance\nsheet entities that issued asset-backed securities, including commercial paper. These\narrangements often benefited from explicit backstop liquidity agreements provided by large\nbanks, or the backstop commitment implied by the reputational concerns of their large bank\nsponsors. These credit enhancements put banks on the hook in the event that investors lost\nconfidence in the underlying assets. This is exactly what happened, of course, causing risky offbalance assets to boomerang back onto banks’ balance sheets. 7 But providing this kind of\nsupport to the securitization process simply reflected large banks exploiting an artificial\ncompetitive advantage they enjoyed. Because of the presumed government backing associated\nwith their too-big-to-fail status, they were better able to hold exposures to large aggregate shocks\n– particularly those involving a scarcity of liquidity – than other market participants. The implicit\nsafety net for large commercial banks thus encouraged them to provide credit enhancements to\nthe securitization process, which further boosted the market for risky mortgage loans.\nThe U.S. housing GSEs, as I noted, were responsible for a significant portion of the ultimate\ndemand for risky mortgage-backed securities. But European banks, many seen as too big to fail\nby their home countries, also took on significant exposures to U.S. housing debt. Thus a\nsubstantial amount of subprime and non-traditional mortgage debt appears to have been held by\nfinancial institutions whose risk-taking incentives were distorted by safety net support regimes.\nFuture research will be needed to quantify the extent to which such incentive effects could, by\nthemselves, account for the magnitude of the housing boom and subsequent bust. Qualitatively,\nhowever, the moral hazard problems infecting the ultimate investors in mortgage-backed\nsecurities could plausibly explain seemingly suboptimal behavior throughout the housing finance\npipeline, from deceptive origination practices to manipulated rating agency analyses.\n\n3\n\n\fHaving been central to the build-up of risks, safety net ambiguity also played an important role, I\nbelieve, in how the ensuing crisis unfolded. In the initial bout of financial market turmoil in\nAugust 2007, investors pulled away from financial institutions that were perceived to have\nsignificant potential exposure to subprime mortgage losses, including through liquidity support\nfor off-balance sheet entities. Interbank borrowing costs rose as lenders demanded higher\ncounterparty risk premia. The Federal Reserve responded by lowering the discount rate’s spread\nover the target federal funds rate and encouraging visible use of the discount window to dispel\nthe “stigma effects” that were believed to discourage borrowing. This conveyed the message that\ncentral bank lending would be forthcoming to prevent or ameliorate the adverse consequences of\nthe tumult in financial markets. While many financial firms raised additional capital in the\nmonths that followed, some institutions, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, let\nopportunities to improve their balance sheets and reduce their vulnerability to a loss in investor\nconfidence pass them by.\nUncertainty about whether the short-term creditors of such firms would be protected by\ngovernment support meant that policymakers faced an excruciating dilemma if one of them ran\nout of liquidity. Letting a firm file for bankruptcy could diminish the odds investors placed on\ngovernment support for other similarly-situated firms, risking a sudden investor retreat that\nwould add to market volatility. Protecting creditors and counterparties becomes irresistible,\ndespite knowing how it might exacerbate moral hazard. By late September 2008, the fact that six\nlarge financial failures had been handled five different ways 8 caused tremendous market\nuncertainty regarding the status of safety net protection. At that point, establishing and\narticulating credible new boundaries around future support would have been very difficult. This\nsuggests that future assessments of the official response to the financial crisis will hinge less on\nthe TARP and the large-scale market interventions by the Fed that followed AIG, and more on\nhow the sequence of actions in the year before might have discouraged critical actions that firms\ncould have taken to protect against financial distress.\nOne result of the crisis is that official support has been given to a set of firms and markets that\nextends well beyond our estimate of the safety net as of 1999. Taking into account actions taken\nover the last three years, Richmond Fed researchers have updated their safety net estimate to the\nend of 2008, with the figure for implicit protection now standing at 37 percent of financial sector\nliabilities, reflecting the growth in the housing GSEs and the extension of support to financial\ninstitutions beyond commercial banks. 9 Interestingly, while the fraction of financial sector\nliabilities backed by explicit government support has declined to 22 percent, the total safety net\nhas grown to cover 59 percent of the financial sector at the end of 2008. The expansion we’ve\nseen in the safety net over time has been, I believe, a direct result of the ambiguity of unstated,\nimplicit guarantees.\nWith market discipline increasingly compromised by a growing financial safety net, regulatory\noversight becomes the main defense against excessive risks in the financial system. And if banklike risk-taking in the form of maturity transformation takes place outside of the formal banking\nsector but is still likely to elicit support in a crisis, then regulation would need to extend to these\nactivities as well. But financial markets in the past have shown a seemingly endless capacity for\ninventing ways to engage in bank-like maturity transformation in new forms and new places, just\noutside the reach of regulation. To successfully limit excessive risk taking in a world of safety\n4\n\n\fnet ambiguity, regulation needs to anticipate and constrain innovation. This is a daunting task,\nbecause it requires distinguishing between beneficial and detrimental innovations. As a result,\nnew forms of financial fragility seem inevitable, and financial crises are likely to recur.\nThis logic suggests a vicious circle. Regulation seeks to rein in the adverse incentives created by\nthe safety net. Regulation, in turn, creates the incentive to find innovations that by-pass existing\nconstraints but create potentially fragile financial arrangements that could well receive support in\na crisis. The prospect of support makes these new arrangements less costly and leads to their\nbeing over used, contributing to a build-up of risks in the financial system. When a crisis occurs,\nsafety net ambiguity may once again be resolved in favor of protection, necessitating a further\nexpansion of regulatory reach. 10\nTo the extent this vicious circle has driven the expansion of an implicit safety net whose\nincentive effects were responsible for the crisis, the problem prior to the crisis was not solely or\neven primarily insufficient regulation. As much if not more responsibility ought to be attributed\nto the long-standing tolerance of an open-ended, unlegislated and implicit safety net commitment\nfor large financial firms. So to my mind, assessment of the regulatory response to this crisis will\ndepend predominantly on how well it clarifies and places discernable boundaries around the\nfederal financial safety net.\nBills currently under consideration in Congress seek to break this cycle of regulation, by-pass,\ncrisis, and rescue by giving policymakers the discretion to extend the scope of regulation to any\nfinancial institution whose failure might induce government support. The success of this strategy\nwill depend critically on ability of regulators to identify ex ante the risk-taking that can cause so\nmuch damage ex post. While regulators have a fairly good record of preventing exact replicas of\npast crises, it is another matter entirely to foresee the distress that might result from the\nconfluence of innovative financial arrangements and shocks to unanticipated macroeconomic\nfundamentals.\nThe bills before Congress also would expand the tools available to policymakers by providing\nthe Treasury and the FDIC with the authority to seize and liquidate failed nonbank financial\ninstitutions. This seems like a natural extension of the FDIC’s existing powers to resolve failing\nbanks, but the FDIC would be allowed to provide funds to the receiver that could be used to\nsettle short-term debts as they came due. Even if shareholders are dutifully “wiped out” and the\nfirm ultimately closed, the protection of short-term creditors weakens the incentives of the most\ncritical liability holders. If, in a crisis, regulators remain focused on alleviating ex post distress,\nthey are likely to err on the side of rescue and further weaken market discipline. A provision of\nthe Senate bill that provides for “clawbacks” of funds advanced in excess of what a claimant\nwould receive in liquidation could restore some discipline to the process. But limitations in the\nclawback mechanism could mean that short-term creditors still benefit from the use of public\nfunds.\nThe tensions evident in the negotiation of the Senate provisions on resolution authority mirror\nthe tensions between an ex post and an ex ante perspective on policy questions. The expansion of\nthe implicit safety net has been driven by the pursuit of ex post efficiency – that is, doing\nwhatever it takes to alleviate the adverse impact of financial distress once it has occurred. 11\n5\n\n\fFuture economists may continue to debate whether official interventions in this crisis have\nachieved significant ex post efficiency gains, but our true goal ought to be ex ante efficiency, not\nex post efficiency. That is, people’s expectations about ex post policy interventions affect their\nchoices ex ante, and policy evaluation should take that into account.\nWhen the pursuit of ex post efficiency and ex ante efficiency is in conflict – that is when there is\na “time consistency problem” – two broad strategies are possible. One is to tie one’s hands by\npreventing the actions one would take to pursue ex post efficiency when it conflicts with ex ante\nefficiency. This motivates the clawback provision of the Senate resolution title, which attempts\nto limit actions regulators might be tempted to take to provide short-term creditors of a failing\nfinancial firm more than they would get in bankruptcy. And the elimination of the Federal\nReserve’s so-called Section 13(3) power to extend emergency loans to individual entities outside\nthe banking system certainly helps. But my early assessment is that the House legislation –\nand to some extent even the Senate version – creates enough discretionary rescue powers to\ndampen market discipline and sustain the vicious circle that brought us an expansive financial\nsafety net.\nAn alternative strategy is for policymakers to invest in a reputation for pursuing ex ante\nefficiency rather than ex post efficiency. This, arguably, was the strategy pursued by the Volcker\nFOMC to reduce inflation in the early 1980s, when the short-run costs of disinflation might have\ndeterred a policymaker focused solely on ex post efficiency. 12 And, arguably, we will not break\nthe cycle of regulation, by-pass, crisis and rescue until we are willing to clarify the limits to\ngovernment support, and incur the short-term costs of confirming those limits, in the interest of\nbuilding a stronger and durable foundation for our financial system. Measured against this gauge,\nmy early assessment is that progress thus far has been negligible.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this speech.\nTom Humphrey, “Monetary Policy Frameworks and Indicators for the Federal Reserve in the 1920s,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, Winter 2001, vol. 87, no. 1, pp. 65-92.\n3\nHarold L.

            "content": "The Piedmont-Triad Regional Economic Outlook, May 2010\nMay 11, 2010\nThe Second Annual Piedmont Triad Economic Development Summit\nGreensboro, N.C.\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nIt’s a pleasure to discuss the regional and national economic outlook with you today. Like many\nparts of our country right now, the Piedmont-Triad region faces daunting economic challenges.\nThe recession we have just been through was severe. But the U.S. economy has been expanding\nsince about the middle of last year, and there is evidence of improvement in the Triad region as\nwell. This morning my task is to survey the regional economic outlook for you, in order to help\nyou think through what lies ahead for the Piedmont-Triad. Because economic conditions in the\nrest of the country are such an important influence on local economic conditions, my approach\nwill be to spend roughly equal time on the national outlook and economic conditions in this\nregion. Before I begin, I should mention that these are my own views and are not necessarily\nshared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. 1\nTo start with the picture for the U.S. economy as a whole, we are, as I said, in the process of\nrecovering from a very severe recession. A wide range of indicators show that economic activity\nhas been expanding since the middle of last year. Real GDP, for example, has grown at a 3.7\npercent annual rate over the last three quarters, which is a bit above its long-run trend. Granted,\nsome of the increase was due to one-time factors. Last year’s fiscal stimulus measures, for\nexample, have been providing some boost to activity since the second half of last year, but the\neffect will largely fade away over the course of 2010. And the way GDP is calculated, it received\nan additional one-time boost from the completion in mid-2009 of the sharp inventory reduction\nthat is typical of recessions. Demand since then has been met entirely from production, which is\nwhat GDP measures, rather than by drawing down inventories.\nA look at the most recent GDP report, however, supports the idea that we’re on a sustainable\nupward trajectory. Let’s start by taking a look at consumers. Their spending accounts for more\nthan two-thirds of total spending in the GDP, and it is now clearly on an upswing. During the\nrecession – that is, in 2008 and the first half of 2009 – real consumer spending fell at a 1.2\npercent annual rate. But in the last half of 2009, consumer spending increased at a 2.2 percent\nannual rate, and last quarter it increased at a 3.6 percent rate. That turnaround is likely to be\ndurable, in my view. During a severe recession consumers tighten up on spending, in part due to\njob losses and the associated cut in current incomes, but also due to their weakening outlook for\nfuture income growth. Moreover, many households prudently defer major purchases when the\nheadlines are alarming and jobs are threatened. But when the worst of the bad news begins to\nebb, a growing number of households begin to sense that their jobs are in less jeopardy than they\nhad thought. That improvement in expected income trends combines with the release of pent-up\n\n\fdemand for big-ticket items and leads to a pickup in consumption spending. So while unexpected\nadverse shocks that disturb household income prospects have the potential, as always, to set this\nprocess back, the baseline outlook for consumer spending suggests growth at reasonably healthy\nrates in the months ahead.\nThe brighter picture is not limited to consumers. Business investment in equipment and software\nusually displays large swings in recessions and recoveries, and the latest experience fits that\npattern very well. After falling at a 14.7 percent average annual rate during the recession, this\ninvestment category bottomed out in the third quarter and has risen at an average annual rate of\n16 percent over the last two quarters. Again, prudent firms often defer capital spending in\nrecessions, which creates a pent-up demand that boosts spending early in recoveries. And while\nsales may have fallen in many industries, technology continues to advance. As a result, there’s an\narray of opportunities to deploy new capital to improve business processes and consolidate IT\ninfrastructure. So I expect equipment and software spending to continue to rise this year and\nbeyond.\nThis good news on spending has had a clear impact on the supply side of the economy. In\nmanufacturing we have seen a sizable swing in activity. Industrial production fell almost 15\npercent during the recession; since June of last year, it has risen every month, resulting in a\ncumulative increase of over 6 percent. That turnaround is evident in consumer goods, especially\nautos; business equipment; and raw materials; and even the production of construction supplies\nincreased last quarter. Forward-looking indicators also are painting a brighter picture. An\nassociation of purchasing managers publishes information monthly on new orders for\nmanufactured goods in the form of an index that takes on a value of 50 when the number of\nresponding firms with rising orders equals the number of responding firms with falling orders.\nThat index fell to a record low level of 22.9 in December, 2008, but has been above 55 every\nmonth since last July, and hit a sky-high level of 65 last month. This shows that a clear majority\nof manufacturers are seeing their order books expand, setting the stage for further increases in\nproduction this year.\nI should put all this good news in the proper perspective, however. While the beginning of a\nrecovery does mark the return of growth in overall economic activity, there are always economic\nsectors where weakness persists for some time. For example, while residential construction has\nstabilized over the course of the last year, it may not be a major contributor to growth in the near\nterm. We had an incredible boom-bust cycle in housing – the number of new housing starts rose\nfrom 1.4 million in 1995 to 2.1 million in 2005 before falling to 554, 000 last year. For\nperspective, it would take about 1.1 million starts per year to accommodate population growth\nwith an unchanged homeownership rate. During the boom we built more houses – and bigger\nhouses – than we ended up needing, and currently a large number of homes are vacant\nnationwide. While home prices may have stopped falling, most observers see only a slow,\nuneven advance in home building for some time.\nIn addition, the recession caused a sharp fall in the demand for commercial real estate, which has\nresulted in elevated vacancy rates in everything from retail stores and warehouses to offices and\nmanufacturing facilities. Nonresidential construction spending has fallen 15 percent over the last\nseven quarters. And leading indicators for this sector, such as architectural billings and vacancy\n\n\frates, suggest that nonresidential construction will continue to be very soft for an extended\nperiod.\nThe most visible and painful fallout from the recession, however, can be seen in the labor\nmarket, where we lost 7.3 million jobs during the recession. Then in the last half of 2009, while\nGDP and manufacturing production were increasing, we lost an additional 1.1 million jobs. That\nhas raised the prospect of another jobless recovery such as the one that followed the 2001\nrecession, when employment fell for a 21-month period after the official end of the recession.\nThis time, though, we are already seeing evidence that employment is on the path to steady\ngrowth. Payrolls expanded by 573,000 jobs in the first four months this year, and the pickup in\ndemand that is already underway is likely to keep employment on an upward trajectory.\nIt will take some time, however, to make substantial progress reducing the ranks of the\nunemployed. The loss of over 8 million jobs caused unemployment to surge from 4.4 percent of\nthe labor force in 2007 to 10.1 percent last October. Although the most recent reading is\nsomewhat lower, at 9.9 percent, its elevated level is an indication of just how much ground\nremains to be covered. Keep in mind that as the labor market strengthens, more people begin to\nactively look for work and thereby add to the number of people that are counted as unemployed,\nand that happened in April. Despite strong job growth that month, 635,000 people entered the\nlabor force and the unemployment rate rose by two tenths of a percent. This latest experience\nillustrates a phenomenon that is familiar to students of previous business cycles: month-to-month\nmovements in the unemployment rate can be misleading in the early stage of a cyclical recovery,\nand as a result, employment growth can provide a better read on labor market trends. And there,\nas I said, the recent news has been encouraging.\nThis recession took an even greater toll on North Carolina’s workforce. While total employment\nin the nation declined a little more than 6 percent since the beginning of 2008, the roughly\n300,000 jobs lost in North Carolina amounted to more than 7 percent – and the loss rate in the\nTriad region was even larger. The state saw a commensurately sharper increase in\nunemployment. After matching the national rate of 4.4 percent late in the expansion, North\nCarolina’s unemployment rate jumped to 11.2 percent during the worst of the recession,\nexceeding the national rate by more than one full percentage point. In the Triad region,\nunemployment reached 11.4 percent at the end of last year, though it has declined slightly as of\nMarch.\nSeveral factors account for the more pronounced downturn in this region. One of the most\nnoteworthy was an industry structure that was particularly vulnerable to the collapse in global\ndemand for manufactured goods. Despite recent successes in diversifying its economic base,\nNorth Carolina is still more heavily concentrated in manufacturing industries than the rest of the\nnation. While manufacturing accounts for a little less than 9 percent of total employment in the\nU.S., it accounts for more than 11 percent in the state and more than 14 percent in the Triad\nregion.\nThe global downturn in late 2008 was particularly unkind to the Triad. The region has undergone\na broad secular decline in manufacturing, much like the American Midwest experienced during\nthe late 1970s and early 1980s. Just prior to the most recent downturn, it appeared that the Triad\n\n\fhad put most of that decline behind it and was beginning to recover. To be sure, the cyclical\nupturn in global economic activity following the 2001 downturn provided some help. Yet at the\nsame time, some of the regional initiatives aimed at broadening the structure of the regions’\neconomy were beginning to bear fruit. Indeed, although employment was slow to rally after the\n2001 recession, a steady gain in jobs was achieved starting in early 2004 and lasting until the\nonset of the recession at the end of 2007.\nEconomic downturns, however, can interrupt even the best laid plans, particularly a contraction\nas severe as the one we just experienced. The history of the Fed Ex hub at the Piedmont Triad\nInternational Airport symbolizes the region’s frustrations. Fed Ex was, if you’ll pardon the\nexpression, a high-flying company experiencing strong growth in shipments here and abroad as a\nresult of a robust expansion in global trade. Its decision to locate an Atlantic cargo hub at PTI\nwas welcome news for the region’s planners, given their focus on transportation and logistics.\nBut just as the facility was ramping up to meet projected increases in shipments, global trade\ncollapsed and freight volume plunged.\nDespite the understandable disappointment, the development of a transportation and logistics\ncluster should be viewed as a plan delayed, not denied. Economic growth is, as I said, turning up,\nand has begun to boost manufacturing output and freight shipments across the globe. For\nexample, PTI reported that Fed Ex shipments in March 2010 were nearly 42 percent ahead\ncompared to a year earlier.\nMore broadly, consumer spending and business investment are driving a recovery in U.S.\neconomic activity that has expanded to include more industries, more regions and more workers.\nDespite the remaining weak patches in commercial construction and housing, labor markets are\nstabilizing and we’ve begun to see a measure of job growth here in the North Carolina and the\nTriad too. While unemployment rates are still quite elevated in the state and in this region, the\nworst of the deterioration is now behind us and we can look forward to a continuing expansion.\nThe presence of FedEx and the expansion of the airport give the region a competitive advantage\nthat is likely to pay dividends as the recovery solidifies and gains momentum.\nThe cyclical upturn in general economic activity will provide some relief to the Triad region as it\ncontinues to work through some of its longer term structural challenges. The decline of\ntraditional manufacturing industries in the Triad, and in North Carolina more broadly, represents\nin part a continuing shift away from more labor-intensive manufacturing. Global competitors can\noften underprice U.S. firms on goods made using lower-skilled workers. And new capital\nequipment tends to be labor-saving, which enables manufacturers remaining the U.S. to produce\nmore output with less by way of labor inputs than in the past. In addition, new “advanced\nmanufacturing” technologies often require workers with different skills than were required in\nold-line manufacturing operations. As a result, many displaced workers from declining industries\nare a mismatch for the higher skills required in the new production environments. We often hear\npeople say that some jobs are “gone and will never come back.” An alternative perspective is\nthat the old jobs get traded in for new jobs with higher skill requirements. Economists call this\n“skill-biased technological change,” and it appears to have been an important feature of\neconomic growth over the last several decades. 2\n\n\fThe steady shift toward higher skill requirements for our workforce suggests critical roles for\neducation and training. And I think some of the most promising news for the Triad is on the\neducation front. The founding of the Joint School for Nanoscience and Nanoengineering, and the\nestablishment of a National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center here further\nenhance the area’s rich educational environment. In addition to the obvious benefits of a better\neducated workforce, these new endeavors have the potential to more rapidly translate research\nand development efforts into new, job-creating enterprises for the region.\nI should emphasize that the steady demand for upgraded skills extends beyond the scientists and\nengineers that our four-year colleges and universities must supply. We also will need technicallyadept production workers with the knowledge and ability to manage sophisticated equipment and\nthe analytical problem-solving ability to continually improve the quality and efficiency of\noperations. Community colleges play a key role in training such workers, including through\nprograms tailored to specific employers. A critical measure of success for any region undergoing\nthis skill-biased transformation is the extent to which workers displaced from old-line\nmanufacturing operations are retrained to attain the higher skill levels needed for employment in\nthe newer production environment.\nFortunately, North Carolina has a strong education system that supports much more than\ntraditional four-year college degrees. Educators in the Triad, for example, have leveraged high\nschools and community and technical colleges to augment traditional four-year programs in\nsupport of the region’s growing aerospace cluster. These types of initiatives will be vital in\ncreating and maintaining the skilled workforce that will continue to attract growing companies\nlike Hondajet, Cessna and Comair to the region.\nOne might wonder what state and local governments can do to help this skill-biased transition\nprocess. Economists who have looked at that question suggest that spending to improve the\nquality of human capital ultimately yields high returns in the form of greater employability and\nhigher wages over a worker’s lifetime. 3 The array of human capital strategies ranges from\ninvestment in early childhood education, where the benefits are long term, to customized job\ntraining programs that match employers’ needs and show more immediate results. As always,\nwell-grounded research is essential to improving program effectiveness over time.\nThe severity of the most recent economic downturn, however, slashed state and local\ngovernment revenues at the very time outlays were rising as well, leaving budgets severely\nstrained at every level. Economic downturns, however, are unlikely to reduce the expected\nreturns on human capital investments, so keeping long-term priorities in sight is critical.\nTo summarize, then, U.S. consumer spending and business investment in equipment and\nsoftware are driving a recovery that is gradually picking up steam. Housing and commercial\nconstruction are likely to lag behind. While the Piedmont-Triad region was hit harder than other\nparts of the country due to a concentration in manufacturing and exports, efforts to attract\ntransportation and logistics activity seem to be bearing fruit. I expect the region’s economic\nrecovery to track the national recovery, but with perhaps a bit of a lag. More broadly, the longer\nterm challenge is to keep up with the continually rising demand for higher skilled workers. Here,\n\n\fthe outlook is more promising due to recent higher education initiatives and a generally strong\nstate educational state system.\nAnd finally, an economic outlook address by a central bank official would not be complete\nwithout mention of inflation, and fortunately, I can be brief. Inflation, the best we can measure it,\nhas been running between 1 and 2 percent since early last year. Although some recent readings\nhave come in below that range, I believe inflation is unlikely to stay that low. In fact, the public\napparently expects higher inflation in the future, which suggests that policymakers will need to\nbe careful to avoid waiting too long to raise rates.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Rick Kaglic, Ann Macheras, Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this speech.\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "Economic Outlook, May 2010\nVirginia International Investors Forum\nVirginia Economic Development Partnership’s Division of International Investment and Trade\nMay 6, 2010\n\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nIt’s a pleasure to discuss the economic outlook today. Before I begin, I should mention that these are my\nown views and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1\nTo start with the big picture, we’re in the process of recovering from a very severe recession, and despite\nthe unique causes of the contraction, this recovery resembles many that we’ve seen in the past. Signs of\nstrength are particularly notable in manufacturing, business equipment investment, and consumer\nspending. As with other recoveries, other segments of the economy are lagging behind the broad pickup\nin activity, most notably employment and construction. Inflation has remained quite moderate. The most\nlikely scenario is for the recovery to strengthen further in coming months. That’s the broad-brush view;\nnow I would like to fill in the canvas with some details.\nA wide range of indicators show that economic activity has been expanding since the middle of last year.\nReal GDP, for example, has grown at a 3.7 percent annual rate over the last three quarters, which is a bit\nabove its long-run trend. Granted, some of the increase was due to one-time factors. Last year’s fiscal\nstimulus measures, for example, have been providing some boost to activity since the second half of last\nyear, but the effect will largely fade away over the course of 2010. And the way GDP is calculated, it\nreceived an additional one-time boost from the completion in mid-2009 of the sharp inventory reduction\nthat is typical of recessions. Demand since then has been met entirely from production, which is what\nGDP measures, rather than by drawing down inventories.\nA look at the fine brushstrokes of the most recent GDP report, however, supports the idea that we’re on a\nsustainable upward trajectory. Let’s start by taking a look at consumers. Their spending accounts for more\nthan two-thirds of total spending in the GDP, and it is now clearly on an upswing. During the recession –\nthat is, in 2008 and the first half of 2009 – real consumer spending fell at a 1.2 percent annual rate. But in\nthe last half of 2009, consumer spending increased at a 2.2 percent annual rate, and last quarter it\nincreased at a 3.6 percent rate. That turnaround is likely to be durable, in my view. During a severe\nrecession consumers tighten up on spending, in part due to job losses and the associated cut in current\nincomes, but also due to their weakening outlook for future income growth. Moreover, many households\nprudently defer major purchases when the headlines are alarming and jobs are threatened. But when the\nworst of the bad news begins to ebb, a growing number of households begin to sense that their jobs are in\nless jeopardy than they had thought. That improvement in expected income trends combines with the\nrelease of pent-up demand for big-ticket items and leads to a pickup in consumption spending. So while\nunexpected adverse shocks that disturb household income prospects have the potential, as always, to set\nthis process back, the baseline outlook for consumer spending suggests growth at reasonably healthy rates\nin the months ahead.\nThe brighter picture is not limited to consumers. Business investment in equipment and software usually\ndisplays large swings in recessions and recoveries, and the latest experience fits that pattern very well.\nAfter falling at a 14.7 percent average annual rate during the recession, this investment category bottomed\n\n\f2\nout in the third quarter and has risen at an average annual rate of 16 percent over the last two quarters.\nAgain, prudent firms often defer capital spending in recessions, which creates a pent-up demand that\nboosts spending early in recoveries. And while sales may have fallen in many industries, technology\ncontinues to advance, and as a result there’s an array of opportunities to deploy new capital to improve\nbusiness processes and consolidate IT infrastructure. So I expect equipment and software spending to\ncontinue to rise this year and beyond.\nThis good news on spending has had a clear impact on the supply side of the economy. In manufacturing\nwe have seen a sizable swing in activity. Industrial production fell almost 15 percent during the recession;\nsince June of last year, it has risen every month, resulting in a cumulative increase of over 6 percent. That\nturnaround is evident in consumer goods, especially autos; business equipment; and raw materials; and\neven the production of construction supplies increased last quarter. Forward-looking indicators also are\npainting a brighter picture. An association of purchasing managers publishes information monthly on new\norders for manufactured goods in the form of an index that takes on a value of 50 when the number of\nresponding firms with rising orders equals the number of responding firms with falling orders. That index\nfell to a record low level of 22.9 in December, 2008, but has been above 55 every month since last July,\nand hit a sky-high level of 65 last month. This shows that a clear majority of manufacturers are seeing\ntheir order books expand, setting the stage for further increases in production this year.\nManufacturing also has been aided by the pickup in growth among our major trading partners since the\nfirst half of last year. A year ago, real exports were falling at nearly a 30 percent annual rate. In the first\nquarter of this year, however, real exports grew at an annual rate of 5.8 percent, for a third consecutive\nquarter of positive contributions to GDP. That increase in export demand is clearly visible on Virginia’s\nwaterfront. Nearly every measure of export activity for the Port of Virginia in the first quarter shows a\nyear-over-year increase that surpasses the growth achieved over the past several years. While this activity\nis still below pre-recession levels, Virginia firms and workers are benefiting from this recent upward\ntrend. Virginia’s economy also benefits from the many internationally owned companies that call the\ncommonwealth home and are helping to drive increased business investment as well as export activity.\nI should put all this good news in the proper perspective, however. While the beginning of a recovery\ndoes mark the return of economic growth, it can take a while for that growth to make up all of the ground\nlost during the contraction in economic activity that marked the recession. Thus most observers expect a\n“full recovery” to take several years, and I see no reason to quarrel with that assessment.\nIn particular, take a look at the labor market, where we lost 7.3 million jobs during the recession. Then in\nthe last half of 2009, while GDP and manufacturing production were increasing, we lost an additional 1.1\nmillion jobs. That has raised the prospect of another jobless recovery such as the one that followed the\n2001 recession, where employment fell for a 21-month period after the official end of the recession. This\ntime, though, I think that employment is already on the path to steady growth. Payroll expanded by\n162,000 jobs in the first quarter, and the pickup in demand that is already underway is likely to keep\nemployment rising this year. It will take some time, however, to make substantial progress reducing the\nranks of the unemployed. The loss of over 8 million jobs caused unemployment to surge from 4.6 percent\nin 2007 to 10.1 percent last October. Since then, unemployment has edged down slightly to 9.7 percent,\nbut its elevated level is an indication of just how much ground remains to be covered.\nIn Virginia, the downward job trajectory was not as steep as for the nation, but the recession produced\nsignificant job loss here nonetheless. During the first half of 2009 the commonwealth experienced a net\nloss of 87,000 jobs, but with economic activity improving during the second half of the year, only 34,000\njobs were lost. More promising, during the first quarter of 2010, Virginia had a net gain of 3,700 jobs,\nwith the most recent data for March placing Virginia among the fastest growing states in the nation.\nAnother encouraging characteristic of the recent job gain is that we are seeing increased activity beyond\n\n\f3\neducation and health services and the government sectors – for example, professional and business\nservices; trade, transportation and utilities; and leisure and hospitality, to name a few. Still, with many\nthousands of jobs lost since the recession began, the state needs strong and steady job growth over the\ncoming months to recover lost income for workers and to help stabilize state and local government\nrevenues. Virginia’s unemployment rate has continued to climb from its pre-recession low of less than 3\npercent, to an elevated current level of 7.4 percent. Increasing numbers of previously discouraged workers\nhave re-entered the labor force in recent months, and this phenomenon will likely contribute to a stubborn\nunemployment rate, even as job growth gains more momentum.\nEvery recovery has its dark spots, and those dark spots are certainly evident today. Nonresidential\nconstruction spending – a category that includes stores, offices, warehouses, and other structures – has\nfallen 15 percent over the last seven quarters. Leading indicators for this sector, such as architectural\nbillings and vacancy rates, suggest that nonresidential construction will continue to be very soft for an\nextended period.\nAnd then there’s residential construction, and everyone knows the background here. We had an incredible\nboom-bust cycle in housing – the number of new housing starts rose from 1.4 million in 1995 to 2.1\nmillion in 2005 before falling to 554,000 last year. For perspective, it would take about 1.1 million starts\nper year to accommodate population growth with an unchanged homeownership rate. During the boom\nwe built more houses – and bigger houses – than we ended up needing, and currently a large number of\nhomes are vacant nationwide. While home prices may have stabilized, most observers see only a slow,\nuneven advance in home building for some time.\nVirginia did not escape the boom-bust cycle in housing that caused several metropolitan areas of the\ncommonwealth to experience annual price increases in excess of 20 percent at the peak in 2005, followed\nby a prolonged decline and eventual contraction in home prices during the recession. More recently, home\nprices appear to have stabilized, and existing home sales and building permits have improved relative to a\nyear ago. Still, this sector of Virginia’s economy remains soft and varies quite a bit across the state.\nBut even though there are still weak patches in this recovering economy, on balance, I believe consumer\nspending and business investment are going to be strong enough to drive growth in overall activity. We\nstill haven’t talked about the financial sector, though, and it’s hard to imagine a solid recovery until\nfinancial markets signal expectations of a stronger economic environment. I would first note here that the\nworst is definitely behind us. A large volume of borrowing and lending transactions are completed every\nday, stock prices have risen significantly over the last twelve months, and risk spreads and borrowing\nrates have come down in most areas. The BBB corporate bond rate, for example, is representative for a\nwide range of borrowers and has fallen from 9-¼ percent in November 2008 to about 6-¼ percent now.\nStill, we regularly hear complaints these days about firms being unable to borrow. It is certainly true that\nthere are banks and other lenders who have experienced high losses and are now facing a higher cost of\ncapital. Those lenders are now reducing their outstanding loans, and firms that have traditionally\nborrowed from these capital-constrained lenders may have difficulty getting new loans or even retaining\nexisting credit lines. But the majority of banks appear to be ready and eager to lend to creditworthy\ncustomers – that’s what banking is all about. So while more borrowers may need to shop around in this\nenvironment, I believe that credit market capacity is sufficient to support productive investment and allow\na solid recovery to proceed.\nThe economic picture would not be complete without some comment on inflation. As recently as July,\n2008, the 12-month inflation rate, calculated from the price index for personal consumption expenditure,\nwas 4-½ percent. Of course the price of crude oil had just run up to $140 a barrel that spring. But the core\ninflation index, which leaves out food and energy prices, was 2.7 percent at that time, and to me even that\n\n\f4\nlower number was unacceptably high. That episode was one of several unwelcome instances over the last\ndecade of energy price surges spilling over into core inflation. This pattern suggests that monetary\npolicymakers might need to reconsider the strategy of treating energy price gains as by-gones if the\nfutures curve is flat. Given the broad upward trend in energy prices over the last decade, responding more\naggressively would have kept overall inflation lower and closer to a rate I view as ideal.\nInflation has fallen since the surge of early 2008. In the last six months, the overall inflation rate was 1.8\npercent and the core inflation rate was 1.1 percent. Those numbers are reasonable, and I would be happy\nif inflation remains about where it is. But the public expects to see higher inflation in the future. For\nexample, the median inflation expectation from the University of Michigan’s monthly survey of consumer\nsentiment is 2.9 percent, and other surveys yield similarly results. These readings on inflation\nexpectations have been persistently high, and that’s troubling, since they raise the possibility that people\nthink the FOMC will be unable or unwilling to conduct monetary policy in a way that keeps inflation\nfrom rising significantly during this recovery.\nCertainly monetary policy will be challenging in the period that lies ahead. Current policy settings are still\nat emergency levels, with the federal funds rate near zero and with our balance sheet 2 ½ times the size it\nwas three years ago. These settings are currently providing substantial monetary stimulus. As a technical\nmatter, whenever we decide to begin normalizing policy it will be straightforward to sell assets, shrink\nour balance sheet, and raise the level of short-term interest rates. The difficulty, of course, is that no one\nwants to tighten policy prematurely and needlessly dampen the recovery. So recognizing the right time to\nbegin normalizing our monetary policy settings is going to be hard, and reasonable people can differ\nabout this. For my part, I will be looking for the time at which economic growth is strong enough and\nwell-enough established to warrant raising our policy rate. It may make sense, however, to begin\nnormalizing our balance sheet in advance of raising rates. Normalizing our balance sheet means reducing\nits size, but also returning to our traditional Treasury-only asset holdings. My worry is that we will let the\nobvious slack in the economy lull us into a false sense of security regarding inflation, which could allow\ninflation pressures to build before we raise rates. That happened in 2004 and it could happen again, so we\nat the Fed will need to be careful to avoid waiting too long to raise rates.\nAs a longer-run matter the federal budget deficit implied by current and planned fiscal policies concerns\nme, and ought to concern every American, in my view. If economists can contribute anything to the\npolicy process, it’s our willingness to identify unsustainable trends and remind people that unsustainable\ntrends don’t go on forever. And clearly, our current fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path. The\nCongressional Budget Office estimates that under current legislation, by 2012 the federal debt as a\nfraction of GDP will have more than doubled in 10 years, with further increases occurring each year\nunless major changes are made in spending programs and taxes. Granted, our fiscal problems are not as\nsevere at this point as those of Greece and some other European countries. But I don’t think we want to\nfind out how close we can get to a full-blown fiscal crisis before taking corrective action.\nIn broad terms, we all know what needs to be done – cut spending or raise taxes. If we don’t, an adverse\nsequence of events will be set in train: investors will be increasingly reluctant to hold more Treasury\nsecurities, yields will consequently rise significantly, the cost of capital will increase for firms producing\nin the United States, capital formation will suffer, productivity growth will slow, and thus real household\nincomes will stagnate. In short, the well-being of future generations is at stake. My hope is that\npolicymakers will find a way to move fairly quickly to make the adjustments needed to put the budget on\na sustainable path. The sooner we make the necessary adjustments, the longer the period over which we\ncan spread out the adjustment cost, and the more likely we are to avoid a fiscal crisis of the type Greece is\nnow experiencing.\n\n\f5\nDespite these serious policy challenges, however, I remain fundamentally optimistic about the capacity of\nthe American economy to generate sustained improvements in standards of living. Our country has\nrepeatedly demonstrated an unsurpassed ability to generate technological and organizational innovations\nand deploy them to deliver improved products and services for consumers and businesses. While we have\nstruggled from time to time with economic policy, and no doubt will continue to struggle in the years\nahead, that should not distract us from our signal achievements, nor should it dim our hope for the future.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Ann Macheras, Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this speech.\n\n\f",

            "content": "The Economic Outlook, April 2010\nRegional Forum, April 13, 2010\nMorgantown, W.Va.\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThank you and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s Regional Forum. I suspect\nthat most of you have heard that the recession is over and I also suspect that few of you feel like\nthe recession is over. The unemployment rate is still high nationally and still rising in West\nVirginia. Perhaps the best analogy is to taking a hard foul on the way to the basket; the recession\n(the way economists define it) is over when you hit the floor. But you don’t feel like it’s over\nuntil you get back up on your feet, and even then you may have some lingering bruises. Well, the\nconsensus is that we hit the floor last summer and have been in the process of getting back on\nour feet ever since. That represents recovery, but the pain is still with many of us to be sure, and\nwe are a long way from a full recovery. This evening I would like to share with you my views on\nwhere our economy stands both at the national and state level and where it seems to be headed,\nand then hear directly from you about your concerns. Before I begin, I should note that I speak\nonly for myself and not for my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. 1\nThe recession that appears to have ended last year ranks as one of the deepest on record, and was\nled by the plunge in housing construction that followed the boom. As the housing slump became\nmore severe, it started spilling over into the rest of the economy. I could cite a slew of dismal\nstatistics that would characterize the recession, but I’ll confine myself to one in particular ─ after\npeaking at the end of 2007, the total number of people employed in the U.S. fell by over 8\nmillion, wiping out all of the net job gains during the previous recovery and expansion. West\nVirginia’s payrolls peaked in the third quarter of 2008 and have fallen by over 30,000 since, a\ndrop of 4.2% percent.\nTo put the current national economic conditions in perspective, let me start where the recession\nreally had its origins ─ the housing market, where some stabilization has now become evident.\nSeveral indicators of sales and construction activity hit low points early last year and have risen\nmodestly since then. Even one widely followed index of existing home prices in the U.S. rose a\nseasonally adjusted 4.4 percent from May to January. And housing investment in the fourth\nquarter of last year made its first positive contribution to growth since the second quarter of\n2008. This is an encouraging sign that housing is no longer a drag on the economy. But the\nsignificant over-building that occurred during the housing boom is likely to severely limit the\nability of this key sector to provide the lift to the economic recovery that was typical in the early\nstages of past recoveries.\nConsumer spending posted solid gains over the second half of last year and is widely expected to\nhave increased in the first quarter of this year. Even new vehicle sales, which were a major factor\nin the decline in consumer spending during the recession, have increased from a low of 9.1\n1\n\n\fmillion units in February of last year to 11.8 million units in March of this year. This was the\nindustry’s best performance without the aid of government incentive programs since the\nrecession ended. Let me be clear here ─ consumers are by no means exuberant. The rise in the\nsaving rate ─ to over 3 percent from 1 percent as the recession began in early 2008 – likely\nreflects a combination of apprehension about income prospects and a desire to pay down debt\nand to rebuild wealth depleted by the broad erosion in financial asset and home prices from their\nprevious peaks. But the recent recovery in equity prices and the stabilization in home values are\nno doubt contributing to the upturn in consumer spending.\nBusiness spending on new equipment and software, which fell by over 20 percent during the\nrecession, also has reversed course in the second half of last year. A firming of business spending\non capital goods may seem incongruous in light of the low levels of measured capacity\nutilization in many industries, but excess capacity does not preclude the emergence of profitable\nopportunities to deploy new equipment and software to reduce costs or improve processes and\nservices. For example, information equipment and software ─ a significant source of hi-tech\ngrowth over the last two decades ─ by itself contributed nearly a full percentage point to the 5.6\npercent growth in real GDP in the fourth quarter of last year. Even business investment in\ntransportation equipment added over a quarter of a percentage point to GDP that quarter.\nDespite all these favorable demand-side developments, the relative vigor of GDP in the fourth\nquarter actually surprised many analysts. Of course, part of that vigor reflected a substantial\nswing toward inventory accumulation that provided a significant boost to GDP growth. But even\nexcluding inventories from the calculation ─ an adjustment that results in the statistic known as\nfinal sales ─ GDP managed a respectable 1.7 percent gain over the previous quarter. Final sales\nwill warrant special attention in the months ahead as we assess how rapidly the recovery\nstrengthens.\nI have been focusing thus far on the areas of the economy where improvement is evident. There\nare other areas in which we still face major economic challenges, however. In commercial real\nestate, construction is falling, vacancy rates are rising and falling property prices are eroding\nowners’ equity positions. No one expects a quick reversal in either of these negative trends, and\nas a result, business investment in structures ─ in contrast to the equipment and software\ncategory ─ is likely to be a sizable drag on U.S. growth in the near term.\nIn the struggle between the positive and negative forces on economic growth, the labor market\nultimately will play a pivotal role. More jobs mean more income, more consumer confidence,\nand more consumer spending, which will prompt businesses to continue hiring and investing and\nhelp governments raise revenues. If you agree with me on that point, then I think you will agree\nthat our latest employment release was the most encouraging sign we have seen to date regarding\nthe current recovery. In March, we added 162,000 jobs on net, with goods-producing industries\nadding over 40,000 jobs. Some of those gains represented the hiring of Census workers and some\nwere reversing weather-related losses in February. Even apart from those special factors,\nhowever, the month of March made a major contribution to the first positive quarter for the labor\nmarket since the fourth quarter of 2007. That was just before we took that hard foul and the\nrecession began. While even the more optimistic forecasters do not expect rapid growth in\nemployment this year, the labor market does seem to be lifting itself off the floor now.\n2\n\n\fLet me make one final point on the unique challenges that we are facing in this recovery ─\nnamely the state of small business in America. The recession brought unprecedented job losses\nto businesses with less than 50 employees. This group represents about 90 percent of all business\nestablishments nationwide and employs 40 percent of all workers, and is even more important in\nWest Virginia, where these small businesses account for more than half of all workers. Tight\ncredit often gets the blame for holding back small business expansion these days, but according\nto a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, weak sales are by far the\nnumber one problem facing small businesses. And it is important to recognize that many\nbusinesses of all kinds will naturally face tougher credit terms in a soft economy, because their\nrevenue prospects are likely to be more uncertain. Moreover, the proper benchmark is the ability\nof the banking system as a whole to supply an appropriate quantity of credit, since any one given\nbank may be shrinking their balance sheet while others are expanding. I am not aware of any\nevidence that the banking industry as a whole is inappropriately impeding the availability of\ncredit ─ and that seems to be confirmed by recent small business surveys.\nPutting the whole picture together, I think the most likely outcome for the rest of 2010 is that the\nnational economy will grow at a moderate rate ─ consumers spending will gradually pick up\npace and businesses will continue to expand outlays for equipment and software, and these key\ncomponents of demand should overcome any drag from commercial construction or state and\nlocal government spending.\nFor West Virginia, the recession arrived later than for the rest of the nation, with job losses only\nbeginning in late 2008 and continuing in recent months. Unemployment also rose later in The\nMountain State, jumping from a low 3.8 percent in October of 2008 to more than double that rate\nin just a few months, continuing its sharp rise to a rate of 9.5 percent today. The strength in\nenergy markets in early 2008 helped delay the onset of the downturn here. In addition, the West\nVirginia housing market did not experience the outsized gains of some other states, and therefore\nhome prices and residential construction have not declined quite as sharply. While existing home\nsales in West Virginia have risen consistently in recent months, residential construction remains\nsluggish. With the late entry into recession, West Virginia seems to be following a somewhat\nslower path to recovery, yet West Virginia University’s Bureau of Business and Economic\nResearch has forecast modest job growth for the second half of this year, consistent with the\nnational jobs outlook.\nOf course, there are always risks to any outlook. In the current environment, the labor market\ncould recover more slowly than many expect, which would restrain consumer spending and\ndampen growth. But household incomes and household confidence could also rebound more\nvigorously than many expect, in which case consumer spending could pick up more briskly. It is\nalso worth mentioning a risk that seems particularly prominent in this recovery; firms facing\nmajor uncertainties surrounding federal policies on trade, the environment, financial services,\nand until recently, health care. For a business considering a commitment to new capital spending\nor new hiring, it can be difficult to estimate after-tax yields for an endeavor in an environment\nthat is so rich with proposals for higher taxes and new regulations. This risk could be particularly\nrelevant to West Virginia’s coal mining industry, where uncertainty has become especially\n\n3\n\n\felevated over the past year. No matter how one stands on the environmental issues involved, the\nchanging regulatory landscape could well have a depressing effect on investment outlays.\nTurning now to the outlook for inflation and monetary policy, by all accounts ─ from\ngovernment data to reports we get from our own surveys ─ inflation remains benign, averaging\nabout one and a half percent since early last year. The risk of a pronounced decline in inflation\nhas diminished substantially in my view. But we will need to be careful as the expansion\nstrengthens to keep inflation and inflation expectations in check because experience has shown\nthat an upward drift in inflation expectations can be very costly to unwind.\nTo keep inflation contained, we will need to be careful about when and how to withdraw the\nconsiderable monetary policy stimulus now in place. This requires care during any recovery, but\nthis time the Fed will have two monetary policy instruments at its disposal, not just one. The Fed\ntraditionally has targeted the overnight federal funds rate, which required appropriately adjusting\nthe supply of monetary liabilities (currency and bank reserves). Varying the fed funds rate affects\na broad range of other market interest rates, and thereby influences growth and inflation. Since\nOctober 2008, as the bankers in the room are aware, we have had the authority to pay explicit\ninterest on the reserve balances banks hold. This gives us the ability to vary independently the\namount of our monetary liabilities and a critical overnight interest rate. So when the time comes\nto withdraw monetary stimulus, the FOMC will be able to raise the interest rate on reserves or\ndrain reserve balances, or both.\nThe Fed has been working on two mechanisms by which we could drain bank reserves ─ reverse\nrepurchase agreements and a term deposit facility. Both would amount to issuing Federal\nReserve Bank debt to absorb reserves. While these may be useful as contingency measures, my\npreference would be to rely primarily on sales of the agency debt and agency-guaranteed\nmortgage-backed securities that we have purchased over the course of the last year. Such an\napproach would move us more rapidly to a “Treasuries-only” portfolio, and thus more rapidly\nreduce the extent to which our asset holdings are distorting the allocation of credit. There is no\nreason why MBS sales at a steady, moderate, pre-announced pace (as with our purchase\nprogram) needs to be disruptive to the markets for those securities. In fact, by adding to the\nfloating private sector supply, it should improve market liquidity, which reportedly has been\nhampered by our large-scale purchases.\nLooking beyond the near-term challenges for monetary policy, however, our economy does face\nseveral significant challenges over the longer term. I will discuss two. One of these is the path of\nfuture federal budget deficits implied by current and planned fiscal policies. The government’s\ndebt cannot grow indefinitely at a rate much faster than the economy itself grows, so ultimately,\nsomething has got to change ─ either taxes are raised, spending is reduced, or the real value of\nthe debt is eroded through an increase in inflation, an outcome the Federal Reserve is committed\nto preventing. Failure to establish credible plans for bringing the fiscal position back into balance\nis likely to dampen economic growth, since growing government debt relative to GDP would\nultimately compete with private borrowing by businesses and households.\nOur financial system ─ particularly how it will perform in future financial crises ─ will also pose\nconsiderable longer term challenges. I have argued elsewhere that the most important step to\n4\n\n\fcontaining financial instability is to establish clear and credible limits to the federal financial\nsafety net, which has grown considerably as a result of the crisis. Richmond Fed economists\nestimate that, given the precedents set in 2008, nearly 59 percent of the liabilities of the financial\nsector enjoy explicit or implicit government support, up considerably from about 45 percent as of\n1999. 2 I believe that this crisis, and the attendant expansion of the financial safety net, was the\nresult of there being no clear limits on the government’s legal authority to protect the creditors of\nfailing financial firms.\nWhile the bills that have been passed in the Senate Banking Committee and on the House floor\nexpress the desire to see losses imposed on failing firms’ creditors, they provide the government\nwith wide-ranging discretion to designate financial firms as “systemically important” and use\npublic funds in their resolution. But the resulting ambiguity about rescue policy is likely to just\nperpetuate the forces that brought us “too big to fail” to begin with. Improved regulations will\ncontain the risks that brought us the last crisis, but new risk-taking arrangements inevitably will\narise that by-pass existing regulatory restraints. If authorities allow creditor losses at one failing\nfirm, then creditors are likely to pull away from other similar firms, fearing that authorities will\nforgo supporting them as well. Authorities will feel compelled to resolve uncertainty about\nimplicit safety net support by expanding implied commitments. Subsequent regulations will rein\nin the new arrangements, the danger of which will by then be fully appreciated. But this just sets\nthe stage for another cycle of by-pass, crisis, rescue and regulation.\nA discretionary safety net, with no set boundaries, only feeds this cycle by giving market\nparticipants reason to believe that new, complex arrangements ultimately will be protected. It\nrequires an ever-growing reach of financial regulation, and undermines the market discipline that\nhelps align financial risk-taking with broader societal interests. It also diverts innovative\nresources and energies into less-productive channels, like regulatory by-pass, and away from\nmore fundamental improvements to our standard of living. Striking and preserving the right\nbalance between the safety net, regulation, and market discipline, is vital to ensuring that\nfinancial markets make positive contributions to the resiliency and growth of our economy over\nthe long run.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Robert Schnorbus, Ann Macheras, Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this\nspeech.\n2\nSee John R.

            "content": "Institute of International Bankers, Annual Washington Conference\nMarch 1, 2010\nReal Regulatory Reform\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you this morning. This could not be a more\npropitious time to bring together senior policy makers and financial industry leaders. As we\nspeak, ambitious changes to the U.S. regulatory and supervisory regime are under consideration\nin the halls of Congress. My subject this morning will be the reform of the U.S. financial\nregulatory system, and while much has been written on this vast subject, there is a risk that these\nlaudable efforts get bogged down in less important issues, and we might miss the opportunity for\nreal regulatory reform. So I will devote my remarks this morning to describing what I see as the\nessential, core issues on the regulatory reform agenda. Before I begin, I should note that I speak\nonly for myself and not for my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nGiven the historic financial market instability of the last two years, the search for improvements\nand reforms in financial markets and regulation is not surprising. But if the purpose of reform is\nto achieve greater financial stability, it is essential to inquire first about the nature of the financial\ninstability problem the reforms are aimed at solving. And here it is not enough to simply observe\nthat a crisis has occurred. The considerable downturn in housing market fundamentals alone\nwould have led one to expect substantial movements in financial prices and quantities, with\nattendant strains for many institutions, even in a very well-functioning financial system.\nMany participants in the financial reform debate, however, do not believe that the financial\nsystem functioned well in this crisis. Excessive instability, they contend, is caused by inherent\ndeficiencies in financial markets, and governments must stand ready to intervene to remedy those\ndeficiencies, both in the crisis by preventing failures and beforehand by limiting risk taking.\nWhat are these deficiencies? Some see externalities at work that lead financial market\nparticipants to neglect the spillover effects of one institution’s failure on others; one firm’s\ntrouble weakens confidence in other similar firms, and encourages the spread of “runs” in which\ncounterparties flee simply because they expect others to flee as well. These externalities are\nmade all the more severe, it is said, by the complex web of interconnections among financial\nfirms.\nWhile such theories have popular appeal, on closer examination they provide a rickety\nfoundation on which to rebuild a regulatory edifice. First, the notion of financial market\nspillovers stemming from interconnectedness doesn’t really fit the standard economists’\ndefinition of policy-relevant externalities. Creditors voluntarily chose their counterparties, and\nthey have no inherent reason to neglect the implied exposure to their counterparties’\ncounterparties. Financial asset owners voluntarily agree to a range of potential returns, and they\nhave no inherent reason to neglect any particular possibilities. In short, interconnectedness alone\nis no market failure.\n1\n\n\fTrue, reports that one firm is failing can cause creditors to pull away from other firms. But that\nintelligence can be genuinely informative about other counterparties’ fundamentals, and official\nintervention will not suppress the news that the institution’s condition has turned fatal; that will\nhappen regardless. Moreover, a company’s vulnerability to run-like behavior is the result of how\nthey and their creditors have chosen to structure their financial relationships. Firms that engage\nin maturity transformation – funding holdings of longer term assets with short-term or\ndemandable liabilities – have voluntarily selected a business strategy that leaves them vulnerable\nto adverse news and financial distress in exchange for the lower cost of short term, highly liquid\nfunding.1\nThese observations should suggest deep skepticism of theories of inherently excessive instability\nin financial arrangements. More broadly, the usefulness of such theories as a guide to policy\naction requires a measure of policymaker omniscience regarding economic fundamentals that\nseems farfetched. Officials, in real time, must be able to confidently detect divergences between\nobserved asset prices and fundamental values, and know when a firm's solvency makes a run\nunwarranted. Moreover, they must do so in circumstances in which many of their market\ninformation sources have a vested interest in official assessments. Out-guessing the outcome of\nmarket mechanisms designed to aggregate diverse perspectives is a daunting goal in tranquil\ntimes, and may be unattainable in the turbulence of a volatile market.\nI do believe there is a spillover channel that does add to financial market instability and that\nregulatory reform can and should address. The federal financial safety net – including both\nexplicit and implicit guarantees – is intended to bolster stability by blunting the incentive of\ndepositors or other short-term creditors to run from otherwise sound institutions. But creditors\nwho are uncertain about whether they will be protected will be hypersensitive to whether a\nsimilar institution receives government support. Intervening to prevent losses at one distressed\ninstitution will increase the perceived odds of future intervention in like cases, whereas letting\nthat institution file for bankruptcy will diminish those perceived odds. A sudden investor retreat\nsparked by a collapse in expectations of intervention would just add to financial market volatility\nin an already volatile situation, which is why the sense of urgency about protecting creditors and\ncounterparties becomes overwhelming during a crisis. Policymakers understandably feel\ncompelled to act in ways they find repugnant, despite how it might exacerbate moral hazard.\nThe resolution of ambiguity about implicit safety net guarantees is thus biased toward\nintervention, which tends to expand the scope of implied guarantees over time. Each crisis that\nelicits additional support raises expectations of future support, weakening market discipline and\nmaking business strategies built on maturity transformation more attractive relative to protecting\nagainst runs. This dynamic is not lost on regulators, of course, who invariably toughen regimes\nwithin the scope of their authority to prevent recidivism in the next cycle. This raises the cost of\nregulated intermediation, however, and increases the demand for liquid, deposit-like investment\nvehicles that avoid regulation. So in the next expansion, maturity transformation takes root again\njust outside the regulated zone, where there is a chance of benefiting from the safety net, but full\nregulatory constraints on risk-taking can be avoided. For example, the trust companies that\nsparked the Panic of 1907 were outside the purview of the New York Clearinghouse.2 Money\nmarket mutual funds and the tri-party repurchase agreement (repo) market are two modern\n2\n\n\fexamples of such “regulatory by-pass” that provide deposit-like liquidity without the regulatory\nburden associated with bank intermediation. Given the scale and breadth of their customer base,\nparticipants in bank-like arrangements might reasonably have anticipated government support in\nthe event of widespread market stresses, a conjecture that ultimately was confirmed.\nAggravating this dynamic is the fact that the incentive distortions will be concentrated in those\nstates of the world in which financial system strains are widespread and the safety net is “in the\nmoney.” This encourages firms to discount more heavily exposures to macroeconomic shocks,\nsuch as a nationwide downturn in housing prices, or market-wide liquidity shocks, such as we\nhave seen in this past crisis. Firms facing such incentives would overvalue, for example, the\nsenior tranches of mortgage-backed-securities, relative to fundamentals.\n***\nWhat sort of financial regulatory reform does this diagnosis imply? The events of the last several\nyears certainly have revealed opportunities to improve the regulatory and supervisory regime for\nlarge, complex bank holding companies, and as one should expect the Federal Reserve and the\nother banking agencies are acting aggressively on lessons learned. Tougher capital and liquidity\nrequirements for financial institutions are in order, to more tightly restrain leverage and maturity\ntransformation; the Fed is leading domestic and international efforts to do so. Improvements are\nneeded in understanding and monitoring off-balance sheet exposures of large financial firms and\nthe ways in which they can boomerang back on to their balance sheets; again, the Fed is leading\nefforts to do so. And the ways in which we account for macroeconomic risk factors in assessing\nthe risks facing individual institutions can be improved; here, the Fed is drawing on its unique\nmultidisciplinary expertise to build new supervisory capabilities. These capabilities were\nessential to the so-called bank “stress-tests” last year, which assessed future capital needs under\nadverse but plausible macroeconomic scenarios and dramatically reduced market uncertainty\nabout potential balance sheet risks at those institutions.\nBut regulatory improvements alone, as essential as they are, won’t be enough. This cycle of\ncrisis, rescue and by-pass is destined to recur, and with ever more force, unless we alter what\nmarket participants believe will happen when a financial firm becomes distressed. Recognizing\nthat market discipline requires that creditors expect to bear losses on insolvent counterparties,\nmany financial reform proposals create a new failure resolution process that gives policymakers\nadditional “tools,” besides the existing bankruptcy code, for handling failing firms.\nReformers are right to focus on the dismal options facing policymakers on those climactic\nSunday nights when a large firm’s fate hangs in the balance. But I believe it would be wrong to\nestablish a government fund, as many proposals do, that could be used at regulators’ discretion to\nsoften the blow to a failing firm’s creditors. This discretion would work against the goals of\nresolution reform, particularly the goal of ensuring predictable losses. Expanding policymakers’\ntoolkit will do nothing to reduce the frequency of financial crises if it does nothing to reduce\npolicymakers’ aversion to the destabilizing effect of undermining expectations of government\nsupport for the creditors of other similarly-situated firms.\n\n3\n\n\fReal regulatory reform requires eliminating the inherent ambiguity of the implicit component of\nthe financial safety net. But exactly where do we draw a new bright line around the safety net,\nnow that the old line – government-insured depository institutions – has been demolished?\nNeither economists, lawyers, nor anyone else have been able to define observationally the notion\nof “systemic importance,” which is understandable if their systemic significance stems mainly\nfrom ambiguity of the implicit safety net. One is forced instead to fall back on charter type, and\nhere an appealing choice of scope is the set of institutions affiliated with insured depository\ninstitutions.\nThe credibility of definite boundaries for the safety net will require clear commitment. Those\ninside should have clear expectations about the nature of backstop government liquidity support\nand a commensurate regulatory regime. Those outside should presume they will receive no\nsupport. The credibility of that commitment will require disappointing expectations of creditorprotecting intervention, perhaps in painful ways. But without a willingness to resolve safety net\nambiguity in favor of unassisted failure, we will have continual difficult preventing risky\nmaturity-transformation strategies that by-pass the explicit safety net.\nThe credibility of a clear and well-defined financial safety net could be enhanced by limiting\ndiscretion in the deployment of public funds in a resolution process. And this includes the Fed. I\nand several others have suggested limiting the Fed’s ability to engage in extraordinary credit\nmeasures.3 Such limits might include abolishing the so-called 13(3) provisions that allow the Fed\nto lend to entities outside of banking institutions with regular access to the discount window.\nBeyond the Fed, the bankruptcy process could perhaps be enhanced in ways that speed up the\nresolution process for large financial firms, but retain clear legal rules about the distribution of\nlosses and oversight by a bankruptcy court. Many have argued that such enhancements might\nmake resolving financial failures without public funds more attractive to policymakers.\nCompared to the real reform of clarifying the scope of the financial safety net, optimizing the\nnumber or organization of regulators strikes me as a second- or third-order problem at best. And\nproposals to materially alter the Federal Reserve’s supervisory responsibilities strike me as\nmisguided. First, under every reform proposal I am aware of, the Federal Reserve Banks retain\nthe authority to provide liquidity assistance to banks via their discount windows. This “lender of\nlast resort” function requires making discriminating judgments about the viability of illiquid\ninstitutions on very short notice at the end of the day. In my experience, the capacity to make\nsuch judgments relies heavily on the expertise derived from ongoing supervisory activities,\nwhich give Reserve Bank staff a wealth of knowledge about both local banking markets and the\nlikelihood of a bank failing given its current financial condition. And this is true for both the\nlarge institutions that garner all the headlines, and the hundreds of community banks that are still\nan essential segment of our banking system. As long as the Federal Reserve is responsible for\ndiscount window lending, it makes no sense to diminish the Fed’s robust role in the supervision\nof a range of banking institutions, from large to small.4\nMore broadly, I spoke earlier about why moral hazard is likely to be particularly acute regarding\nmacroeconomic risks. Such risks could affect a broad range of institutions, and thus there will be\nsome economies of scale in supervisory assessments of those risks. More to the point, however,\nmacroeconomic analytics is a core competency that is essential to the conduct of monetary policy\n4\n\n\fand that no other federal banking agency can match. Indeed, the Fed’s macroeconomic expertise\nwas vital to the “stress-tests” that did so much to improve market confidence last spring, and that\nare likely to feature prominently in future capital assessment regimes. Severing the\norganizational link to those competencies is not a wise way to structure bank regulation.\nIn contrast to the attention devoted to rearranging bank regulatory agencies, it is striking that\nmost reform proposals ignore the two failed government-sponsored enterprises that are now in\nU.S. Treasury conservatorship. For the better part of two decades, the GSEs that securitize and\nguarantee the bulk of U.S. mortgage debt grew their businesses under an ambiguous regime that\nled most market participants to view them as implicitly guaranteed. Housing finance cannot\nachieve a sustainable configuration without a final determination of the status of these companies\nand of whether and how we deliver government subsidies to mortgage finance. I have said\nelsewhere that it would be a mistake to try to build this expansion on another housing boom and\nthat over time we should wean our economy off dependence on housing subsidies. Too many\nhouses were built over the last decade, and what we’ve been through the last three years should\nteach us that subsidizing household mortgage debt was a dangerous policy that was carried too\nfar. But whatever society decides about the bias toward housing, real regulatory reform would be\nincomplete without addressing the fate of the government-sponsored housing finance enterprises.\n***\nTo summarize, a healthy, well-functioning financial system requires a restoration of market\ndiscipline, and that will be impossible without clear boundaries on the federal financial safety\nnet. True, regulation and supervision needs strengthening, and that process is well underway at\nthe Federal Reserve and elsewhere. But merely expanding the scope of regulation to chase those\nfirms that extract implicit guarantees by engaging in maturity transformation would be an\ninterminable journey with yet more financial instability in its wake. Arresting the continual\nexpansion of the implicit safety net will in turn require changing what people believe about the\nlikelihood of government support in the event of a future crisis. Having experienced two years of\ndramatic safety net expansion, reconditioning beliefs will be a difficult process. It will require\nwriting clear rules that constrain the use of public funds. But it also will require that the rules be\nconfirmed by future behavior, and this will be the greatest challenge to achieving real financial\nreform.\n1\n\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "The Economic Outlook, January 2010\nRisk Management Association, Richmond Chapter\nRichmond, Virginia\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you again this year to discuss the economic outlook, a task that\nis distinctly more pleasant now than it was a year ago. When I spoke with you last January,\neconomic activity was contracting quite sharply, and while I thought it was reasonable then to\nexpect positive growth in the second half of last year, there was substantial uncertainty about\nhow the contraction would ultimately play out. In particular, the possibility of a deeper\ncontraction could not be dismissed. In the end, however, positive momentum did indeed return.\nThird quarter growth in real GDP exceeded 2 percent, and most economists expect to see a\ndetermination that the recession ended in the middle of last year. While that is undoubtedly good\nnews, the level of economic activity is still far below where it was a couple of years ago;\nunemployment is quite high and many households and firms are making do with far less than\nthey once did. Moreover, substantial economic challenges lie ahead for the U.S. economy.\nHaving said that, I do believe that growth will continue this year and incomes will generally\nimprove. In my remarks today I will discuss the outlook for growth and inflation in the year\nahead, and will touch on some of the important economic challenges we face. Before I begin, I\nshould note that I speak only for myself and not for my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.1\nWhen we spoke last year I spent a fair amount of time on the list of factors that appear to have\ncontributed to the decade-long boom in housing and housing finance that preceded, and appear to\nhave precipitated this recession and the associated financial turmoil.2 The list included:\nhistorically strong growth in productivity, which passed through to growth in real income and the\ndemand for housing; low long-term real interest rates; technologically driven improvements in\nretail credit delivery which lowered borrowing spreads and expanded access to credit; and a\nregulatory regime which may not have adequately contained the moral hazard associated with\nperceptions that many large financial institutions, including especially the government-sponsored\nhousing finance intermediaries Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were “too big to fail.” I don’t\nintend to discuss these at any length today, but I mention them as a warning against mono-causal\nexplanations of what we have just been through.\nThe recession that appears to have just ended ranks as one of the deepest on record, and was led\nby the plunge in housing construction that followed the boom. During the boom home prices\nalmost tripled, but by 2005 evidence began to signal that the run-up had gone too far. Vacancy\nrates began to hit record highs, and measures of home construction and sales activity began to\nfall precipitously. Home prices also began to decline, reducing equity values and household\nwealth, and leading to rising defaults and foreclosures. The layoffs in residential construction\ndampened growth in overall household income and thus household consumption spending. The\nrest of the economy then slowed and the expansion officially ended in December 2007. The\nrecession that followed was longer and deeper than any we have experienced since the 1930s. I\ncould cite a slew of dismal statistics, but I’ll confine myself to one in particular – the number of\n1\n\n\fpeople employed has fallen by 7.2 million through November, since it peaked at the end of 2007.\nVirginia’s portion of that job loss was 127,000, a 3.4 percent drop.\nAs I mentioned earlier, however, the contraction in overall economic activity appears to have\nended last summer. The data we’ve received since then indicate that activity has generally\nimproved. I’ll discuss first the sectors where improvement is most evident. Starting with housing,\nseveral indicators of sales and construction activity hit low points early last year and have risen\nmodestly since then. For instance, single-family housing starts have increased by 35 percent and\nnew home sales have increased by 8 percent. And there are signs that home prices have bottomed\nout as well. One widely followed index of existing home prices nationwide rose a seasonally\nadjusted 3.9 percent from May to October. Even with these welcome gains, however, new\nhousing construction remains well below the pace required to accommodate population and\nincome growth on a sustained basis. That’s to be expected, given what with hindsight appears to\nhave been a substantial overinvestment in housing during the boom. As a result, while I expect\nresidential investment will no longer be a drag on GDP growth, a lengthy period of adjustment\nmay be necessary before any growth in residential investment is warranted.\nConsumer purchases of cars and trucks also began to tail off in 2007 and then fell very sharply in\n2008. Sales hit a low point last February and then increased very gradually before the “Cash for\nClunkers” program boosted sales over the summer. The subsequent payback was smaller than\nmany analysts had forecasted, however, and sales have improved steadily in the last four months.\nGranted, sales are still well below the long-run trend that would be needed to keep the stock of\nvehicles growing in line with population. But, just as with housing, autos are no longer a drag on\nGDP growth and should make positive contributions going forward, in welcome contrast to the\nlast two years.\nReal consumer spending apart from autos, which fell slightly during the recession, also resumed\nan upward path last year. In the third quarter, consumer spending – excluding cars and trucks –\nincreased at a 1.6 percent annual rate, and many economists are expecting a somewhat higher\nadvance to be reported for the fourth quarter. Let me be clear here – consumers are by no means\nexuberant. The rise in the saving rate – to over 4 percent from under 2 percent in August 2008 –\nlikely reflects a combination of apprehension about future income prospects and a desire to\nrebuild wealth depleted by the broad erosion in financial asset and home prices. But the recovery\nin equity prices and the stabilization in home values no doubt have contributed to the modest\nrecent upturn in consumer spending. The ongoing stabilization in labor market conditions, which\nI will say more about in a minute, also appears to have played a role, by giving consumers a bit\nmore confidence in their future income prospects.\nBusiness spending on new equipment and software, which fell a sharp 21 percent during the\nrecession, also has reversed course and registered positive gains. Firmness in business spending\non capital goods may seem incongruous in light of the low levels of measured capacity\nutilization in many industries, but excess capacity in some sectors does not preclude the\nemergence of profitable opportunities to deploy new equipment and software elsewhere to\nreduce costs or improve processes and services.\nIn addition to these favorable domestic developments, there has been a worldwide rebound in\neconomic activity, which is boosting demand in our export industries. A year ago, real exports\n2\n\n\fwere falling at nearly a 30 percent annual rate; in the third quarter, however, real exports\nincreased at almost a 25 percent annual rate.\nToting up all these favorable demand side developments, recent estimates suggest that real GDP\ngrew at roughly a three and three quarters percent annual rate in the second half of last year, its\nmost rapid growth in several years. Part of that growth will reflect the inventory swing – earlier\nin the year inventory liquidation kept production (that is, GDP) below final sales, and the shift\ntoward inventory accumulation provides a temporary boost to GDP growth. That addition to\nproduction will necessitate the hiring of new workers, which will add to households’ incomes.\nConsumers, having deferred many purchases during the recession, will respond to growing\nincomes with higher spending. This is typical of the period immediately following a recession,\nand this time should be no different.\nIndeed, signs of improvement on the supply side are evident. Industrial production has increased\nsignificantly since the low point in June 2009. While the mid-summer rebound in auto\nproduction was significant, even without autos, industrial production has increased by a solid 2.6\npercent over that span. Moreover, a survey-based index published by the Institute for Supply\nManagement rose substantially last year, and indicates that the growth in manufacturing activity\nis spread broadly across different industries. The new orders component of their index has\nregistered even more impressive growth over that period, and is now at its highest level since\nDecember 2004. These particular indexes have a 60-year track record of giving highly reliable\nsignals on recession and recovery, and we have no reason to suspect a break from past form.\nOne key element supporting the recovery is the significant improvement in financial conditions\nthat occurred last year. Corporate borrowing costs have declined considerably, as interest rates\non commercial paper and corporate bonds are now much lower than they were last year. Many\nmajor banks have sold stock successfully and now have the capital to support new lending, even\nif conditions turn out worse than expected. Granted, we frequently hear anecdotal reports of\nbusiness borrowers being turned down for credit, or having long-standing credit lines cut off. It\nis important to recognize, however, that many borrowers will naturally face tougher credit terms\nin a soft economy, because their revenue prospects are likely to be more uncertain. Moreover, the\nproper benchmark is the ability of the banking system as a whole to supply an appropriate\nquantity of credit, since any one given bank may be shrinking their balance sheet while others\nare expanding. I am not aware of any evidence that the banking industry as a whole is\ninappropriately impeding the availability of credit.\nI have been focusing thus far on the areas of the economy where improvement is evident. There\nare other areas in which we still face major economic challenges, however. In commercial real\nestate, construction is falling, vacancy rates are rising and falling property prices are eroding\nowners’ equity positions. Holders of commercial-mortgage-backed securities have already taken\nsizeable losses, with more on the horizon as numerous projects are scheduled for refinancing.\nAnd some community banks have lent heavily to commercial real estate developers and are now\nfacing rising delinquencies and losses. No one expects a quick reversal of these negative trends,\nand as a result, business investment in nonresidential structures is likely to be a sizable drag on\nU.S. growth in the near term.\n\n3\n\n\fMore worrisome is the labor market. The number of people employed fell in 23 out of the last 24\nmonths. The unemployment rate more than doubled, to a 10.0 percent rate in December. Wages\nare under pressure; average hourly earnings in the U.S. in December were up only 2.2 percent\nover the previous December, about half the rate of increase we saw in mid-2007. In the next few\nmonths, as overall economic activity continues to improve, employment is likely to return to an\nupward trajectory. Indeed, we have seen a few initial signs of improving labor demand, such as\nan increase in the average workweek since October. Even the more optimistic forecasters,\nthough, do not expect a rapid improvement in national labor market conditions, and we will need\nto carefully monitor employment and earnings for an extended period.\nVirginia’s labor markets also deteriorated broadly in the recession – for example, unemployment\nis also double the rate of two years ago – but they seem to be farther along in the healing process.\nThe unemployment rate peaked at 7.1 percent in June of last year, and has edged down since\nthen to a rate of 6.6 percent in November.\nPutting the whole picture together, I think the most likely outcome is that the economy will grow\nat a reasonable pace this year – housing should continue to recover from a very depressed state,\nconsumers should gradually expand spending, business investment should make something of a\ncomeback, and these components of demand should overcome a continuing drag from\ncommercial construction.\nI am often asked how economists can be so upbeat in light of the obvious economic challenges\nwe face, such as the severe weakness in the jobs market, the low level of residential construction,\nand the declining level of commercial construction. My answer begins with the observation that\nthere are obvious, serious problems coming out of every recession, and we have a historical\nrecord of 31 previous recessions in this country to study. Despite the obvious problems at the end\nof each recession, we always recover, and quite often more rapidly than many expect. And if you\ndrill down into the details of those 31 recoveries, some common elements are apparent. I already\ntouched on one, the end of the inventory cycle which is boosting production right now. More\nimportant, in my view, is the behavior of individual consumers during recessions. While many\nworkers lose their jobs during downturns, a much greater number of workers remain employed.\nMany of them will take the precaution of cutting back on spending and deferring major\npurchases, just in case something happens to their own job. As the recovery begins to take hold,\nthough, these workers gradually become more confident about their future job and income\nprospects and begin to spend a larger fraction of their incomes. Similarly, many firms will find it\nprudent to reduce capital spending during a recession, but as demand revives, those same firms\nwill see an increasing number of viable investment opportunities. In short, deferred spending in\nrecessions creates pent-up demand by consumers and businesses that will bolster spending once\nthe recession ends. I see no reason for this cycle to be any different.\nAs always, there are some risks around this outlook. The labor market could conceivably recover\nmore slowly than many expect, which would restrain consumer spending and dampen growth.\nBut household incomes and household confidence could conceivably rebound more vigorously\nthan many expect, in which case consumer spending could expand more briskly. It is also worth\nmentioning a risk that seems particularly prominent in this recovery; firms and individuals are\nfacing major uncertainties surrounding federal policies on trade, the environment, health care and\nfinancial services. Fiscal challenges at the state level also contribute to an uncertain business\n4\n\n\fclimate, and Virginia is no exception, given the large budget gap that remains. For a business\nconsidering a commitment to new capital spending or new hiring, it can be difficult to estimate\nafter-tax yields for an endeavor in an environment that is so rich with proposals for higher taxes\nand new regulations. This uncertainty – which I sense has not been so pronounced in previous\nrecoveries – could well bias firms toward deferring new investment and hiring commitments,\nwhich would lead to lower productivity growth and hence a slower recovery.\nTurning now to the outlook for inflation and monetary policy, a year ago many economists\nexpected the exceptionally low level of economic activity to depress inflation, and perhaps even\npush it below zero. Things turned out differently. Inflation expectations, which embody\nprojections about the future conduct of monetary policy, have remained fairly stable according to\nthe best available measures. This has had an anchoring effect on core inflation, which averaged\none and a half percent last year. In my view, that’s a very good performance, and I hope it\ncontinues. Fortunately, the risk of a pronounced reduction in inflation seems to have diminished\nsubstantially at this point. During the recovery period ahead we may face an increasing risk of\ninflation edging upward, which has sometimes occurred during past recoveries. While that risk\nappears to be minimal at this point, we will have to be careful as the recovery unfolds to keep\ninflation and inflation expectations from drifting around.\nWhat we will need to be careful about is when and how to withdraw the considerable monetary\npolicy stimulus now in place. This requires care during every recovery, but this time the Fed will\nhave two monetary policy instruments at its disposal, not just one. The Fed traditionally has\ntargeted the overnight federal funds rate, which required appropriately adjusting the supply of\nmonetary liabilities (currency and bank reserves). Varying the fed funds rate affected a broad\nrange of other market interest rates, and thereby influenced growth and inflation. Since October\n2008, as the bankers in the room are aware, we have had the authority to pay explicit interest on\nthe reserve balances banks hold. This gives us the ability to vary independently the amount of\nour monetary liabilities and a critical overnight interest rate. So when the time comes to\nwithdraw monetary stimulus, the FOMC will be able to raise the interest rate on reserves or drain\nreserve balances, or both.\nDespite the added challenges of this new regime, however, the core objective of monetary policy\nis still price stability. As always, that will require keeping inflation expectations anchored. Since\nthose expectations reflect views about the future conduct of monetary policy, we will need to\nchoose carefully when and how rapidly to remove monetary stimulus. This is the same difficulty\nwe face after every recession though. For my part, I will be looking for the time at which\neconomic growth is strong enough and well-enough established.\nWhile the economic outlook for the coming year appears to be brighter than the year just ended,\nour economy does face several significant challenges over the longer term, and I’ll conclude by\nbriefly mentioning two of these. The first is the path of future federal budget deficits implied by\ncurrent and planned fiscal policies. It should be self-evident that the government’s debt cannot\ngrow indefinitely at a rate much faster than the economy itself grows, as is implied by current\nlaw. Ultimately, something has got to change – either taxes are raised, spending is reduced, or\nthe real value of the debt is eroded through inflation. While economists can debate the effects of\nparticular changes in spending and taxes, at some point a government debt that grows relative to\nGDP inevitably will compete with private borrowing, leading to higher interest rates, slower\n5\n\n\fcapital accumulation, and, therefore, less improvement in standards of living. And when the\nshortfalls get large enough, these effects will be exacerbated by ambiguity about how the fiscal\nimbalance will ultimately be resolved. Failure to establish credible plans for bringing the fiscal\nposition back into balance could dampen economic growth over the long run.\nAnother challenge arises in the area of financial regulatory reform. In the wake of the crisis we\nhave just been through, it makes sense to reexamine our approach to financial regulation. I have\nargued elsewhere that the most important step to ensuring long term financial stability is to\nestablish clear and credible limits to the federal financial safety net – which has grown\nconsiderably as a result of the response to the crisis. I believe that the crisis itself was in no small\nmeasure the result of our not having clear limits on government support. Leverage and excessive\nrisk-taking were encouraged by the belief that large parts of the financial system were implicitly\nprotected, and those beliefs have been ratified. If we retain a stance of official ambiguity as to\nwhen such protection will or will not be forthcoming in the future, then I suspect our\nsusceptibility to disruptive financial crises will continue to grow, and with each crisis, the safety\nnet will become ever more expansive. A more expansive safety net will inevitably require more\nstringent regulation, but regulatory systems are necessarily limited in their capacity to\ncompletely offset the incentive distortions due to the safety net. So just like ambiguity about the\npath of future fiscal policies, continued ambiguity about the financial safety net could limit our\ncapacity for growth in the long run.\nSome observers argue that the financial reform agenda should include changes in the role and\ngovernance of the Federal Reserve. One proposal would extend the GAO’s authority to audit Fed\noperations to include monetary policy decisions. Other proposals would alter our governance\nstructure by making Reserve Bank directors and/or presidents political appointees. I know it\nmight sound self serving for a Fed insider to object to such changes, but I believe such moves\nwould present very serious risks to the effectiveness of monetary policy and ultimately to\neconomic growth and stability. Looking across time and across countries, there is abundant\nevidence that economic policy and macroeconomic performance are generally better when the\ncentral bank’s monetary policy decisions are shielded from the political pressures of the moment.\nFor an illustrative case, one need only look to the 1970s in the U.S., when political influence led\nto high and volatile inflation that disrupted economic growth. The governance of the Federal\nReserve System balances accountability, with ultimate authority resting in Washington, and\nindependence, with the participation of non-political leaders from throughout the country. While\nthe performance of our economy in the last two years has clearly been unsatisfactory, and policy\nmistakes may have contributed to our problems, the Fed’s balanced, hybrid governance structure\nhas, I believe, given us a good record over the better part of three decades. Disrupting that\nbalance would pose another long term challenge for our economy.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for assistance in preparing this speech.\nLacker, Jeffrey M.

That addition to\nproduction will necessitate the hiring of new workers, which will add to households’ incomes.\nConsumers, having deferred many purchases during the recession, will respond to growing\nincomes with higher spending. This is typical of the period immediately following a recession,\nand this time should be no different.\nIndeed, signs of improvement on the supply side are evident. Industrial production has increased\nsignificantly since the low point in June 2009. While the mid-summer rebound in auto\nproduction was significant, even without autos, industrial production has increased by a solid 2.6\npercent over that span. Moreover, a survey-based index published by the Institute for Supply\nManagement rose substantially last year, and indicates that the growth in manufacturing activity\nis spread broadly across different industries. The new orders component of their index has\nregistered even more impressive growth over that period, and is now at its highest level since\nDecember 2004. These particular indexes have a 60-year track record of giving highly reliable\nsignals on recession and recovery, and we have no reason to suspect a break from past form.\nOne key element supporting the recovery is the significant improvement in financial conditions\nthat occurred last year. Corporate borrowing costs have declined considerably, as interest rates\non commercial paper and corporate bonds are now much lower than they were last year. Many\nmajor banks have sold stock successfully and now have the capital to support new lending, even\nif conditions turn out worse than expected. Granted, we frequently hear anecdotal reports of\nbusiness borrowers being turned down for credit, or having long-standing credit lines cut off. It\nis important to recognize, however, that many borrowers will naturally face tougher credit terms\nin a soft economy, because their revenue prospects are likely to be more uncertain. Moreover, the\nproper benchmark is the ability of the banking system as a whole to supply an appropriate\nquantity of credit, since any one given bank may be shrinking their balance sheet while others\nare expanding. I am not aware of any evidence that the banking industry as a whole is\ninappropriately impeding the availability of credit.\nI have been focusing thus far on the areas of the economy where improvement is evident. There\nare other areas in which we still face major economic challenges. In commercial real estate,\nconstruction is falling, vacancy rates are rising, and falling property prices are eroding owners’\nequity positions. Holders of commercial-mortgage-backed securities have already taken sizeable\nlosses, with more on the horizon as numerous projects are scheduled for refinancing. And some\ncommunity banks have lent heavily to commercial real estate developers and are now facing\nrising delinquencies and losses. No one expects a quick reversal of these negative trends, and as\n\n3\n\n\fa result, business investment in nonresidential structures is likely to be a sizable drag on U.S.\ngrowth in the near term.\nMore worrisome is the labor market. The number of people employed fell for 23 straight months\nthrough November. The unemployment rate more than doubled, to a 10.0 percent rate in\nNovember. Wages are under pressure; average hourly earnings in November were up only 2.2\npercent over the previous November, about half the rate of increase we saw in mid-2007. Going\nforward, as overall economic activity continues to improve, employment will return to an\nupward trajectory. Indeed, we have seen a few initial signs of improving labor demand, such as\nan increase in the average workweek in November. Even the more optimistic forecasters, though,\ndo not expect a rapid improvement in national labor market conditions, and we will need to\ncarefully monitor employment and earnings for an extended period. I should note that this\nsection of my remarks was written before this morning’s employment report was released.\nPutting the whole picture together, I think the most likely outcome is that the economy will grow\nat a reasonable pace this year – housing should continue to recover from a very depressed state,\nconsumers should gradually expand spending, business investment should make something of a\ncomeback, and these components of demand should overcome a continuing drag from\ncommercial construction.\nI am often asked how economists can be so upbeat in light of the obvious economic challenges\nwe face, such as the severe weakness in the jobs market, the low level of residential construction\nactivity, and the declining level of commercial construction activity. My answer begins with the\nobservation that there are obvious, serious problems coming out of every recession, and we have\na historical record of 31 previous recessions in this country to study. Despite the obvious\nproblems at the end of each recession, we always recover, and quite often more rapidly than\nmany expect. And if you drill down into the details of those 31 recoveries, some common\nelements are apparent. I already touched on one, the end of the inventory cycle which is boosting\nproduction right now. More important, in my view, is the behavior of individual consumers\nduring recessions. While many workers lose their jobs during downturns, a much greater number\nof workers remain employed. Many of them will take the precaution of cutting back on spending\nand deferring major purchases, just in case something happens to their job. As the recovery\nbegins to take hold, these workers gradually become more confident about their future job and\nincome prospects and begin to spend a larger fraction of their incomes. Similarly, many firms\nwill find it prudent to reduce capital spending during a recession, but as demand revives, those\nsame firms will see an increasing number of viable investment opportunities. In short, deferred\nspending in recessions creates pent-up demand by consumers and businesses that will bolster\nspending once the recession ends. I see no reason for this cycle to be any different. Once again,\nmy outlook is tempered with the recognition that times are tough in many areas, and that a long\nperiod of growth will be needed to fully recover from this recession. So while a recovery is\nfirmly in place, I believe, it is clear that the level of economic activity will disappoint many\npeople for quite some time.\nAs always, there are some risks around this outlook. The labor market could conceivably recover\nmore slowly than many expect, which would restrain consumer spending and dampen growth.\nBut household incomes and household confidence could conceivably rebound more vigorously\n4\n\n\fthan many expect, in which case consumer spending could expand more briskly. It is also worth\nmentioning a risk that seems particularly prominent in this recovery; firms and individuals are\nfacing major uncertainties surrounding federal policies on trade, the environment, health care and\nfinancial services. For a business considering a commitment to new capital spending or new\nhiring, it can be difficult to estimate after-tax yields for an endeavor in an environment that is so\nrich with proposals for higher taxes and new regulations. This uncertainty – which I sense has\nnot been so pronounced in previous recoveries – could well bias firms toward deferring new\ninvestment and hiring commitments, which would lead to lower productivity growth and hence a\nslower recovery.\nTurning now to the outlook for inflation and monetary policy, a year ago many economists\nexpected the exceptionally low level of economic activity to depress inflation, and perhaps even\npush it below zero. Things turned out differently. Inflation expectations, which embody\nprojections about the future conduct of monetary policy, have remained fairly stable according to\nthe best available measures. This has had an anchoring effect on core inflation, which averaged\n1.5 percent last year. In my view, that’s a very good performance, and I hope it continues.\nFortunately, the risk of a pronounced reduction in inflation seems to have diminished\nsubstantially at this point. During the recovery period ahead we may face an increasing risk of\ninflation edging upward, which has sometimes occurred during past recoveries. While that risk\nappears to be minimal at this point, we will have to be careful as the recovery unfolds to keep\ninflation and inflation expectations from drifting around.\nWhat we will need to be careful about is when and how to withdraw the considerable monetary\npolicy stimulus now in place. This requires care during every recovery, but this time the Fed will\nhave two monetary policy instruments at its disposal, not just one. The Fed traditionally has\ntargeted the overnight federal funds rate, which required appropriately adjusting the supply of\nmonetary liabilities (currency and bank reserves). Varying the fed funds rate affected a broad\nrange of other market interest rates, and thereby influenced growth and inflation. Since October\n2008, as the bankers in the room are aware, we have had the authority to pay explicit interest on\nthe reserve balances banks hold. This gives us the ability to vary independently the amount of\nour monetary liabilities and a critical overnight interest rate. So when the time comes to\nwithdraw monetary stimulus, the FOMC will be able to raise the interest rate on reserves or drain\nreserve balances, or both.\nDespite the added challenges of this new regime, however, the core objective of monetary policy\nis still price stability. As always, that will require keeping inflation expectations anchored. Since\nthose expectations reflect views about the future conduct of monetary policy, we will need to\nchoose carefully when and how rapidly to remove monetary stimulus. This is the same difficulty\nwe face after every recession. For my part, I will be looking for the time at which economic\ngrowth is strong enough and well-enough established.\nWhile the economic outlook for the coming year appears to be brighter than the year just ended,\nour economy does face several significant challenges over the longer term, and I’ll conclude by\nbriefly mentioning two of these. The first is the path of future federal budget deficits implied by\ncurrent and planned fiscal policies. It should be self-evident that the government’s debt cannot\ngrow indefinitely at a rate much faster than the economy itself grows, as is implied by current\n5\n\n\flaw. Ultimately, something has got to change – either taxes are raised, spending is reduced, or\nthe real value of the debt is eroded through inflation. While economists can debate the effects of\nparticular changes in spending and taxes, at some point a government debt that grows relative to\nGDP inevitably will compete with private borrowing, leading to higher interest rates, slower\ncapital accumulation, and, therefore, less improvement in standards of living. And when the\nshortfalls get large enough, these effects will be exacerbated by ambiguity about how the fiscal\nimbalance will ultimately be resolved. Failure to establish credible plans for bringing the fiscal\nposition back into balance could dampen economic growth over the long run.\nAnother challenge arises in the area of financial regulatory reform. In the wake of the crisis we\nhave just been through, it makes sense to reexamine our approach to financial regulation. I have\nargued elsewhere that the most important step to ensuring long term financial stability is to\nestablish clear and credible limits to the federal financial safety net – which has grown\nconsiderably as a result of the response to the crisis. I believe that the crisis itself was in no small\nmeasure the result of our not having clear limits on government support. Leverage and excessive\nrisk-taking were encouraged by the belief that large parts of the financial system were implicitly\nprotected, and those beliefs have been ratified. If we retain a stance of official ambiguity as to\nwhen such protection will or will not be forthcoming in the future, then I suspect our\nsusceptibility to disruptive financial crises will continue to grow, and with each crisis, the safety\nnet will become ever more expansive. A more expansive safety net will inevitably require more\nstringent regulation, but regulatory systems are necessarily limited in their capacity to\ncompletely offset the incentive distortions due to the safety net. So just like ambiguity about the\npath of future fiscal policies, continued ambiguity about the financial safety net could limit our\ncapacity for growth in the long run.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for assistance in preparing this speech.\nLacker, Jeffrey M.

            "content": "The Economic Outlook, December 2009\nCharlotte Chamber of Commerce, December 2, 2009\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThank you for inviting me to join you again this year to discuss the economic outlook. You have\nheard the news, no doubt, that most economists have declared that the recession is over. What\nthey mean, however, is merely that the contraction has come to an end, not that all of our\neconomic challenges are behind us. Having said that, I do agree that the national economy has hit\nbottom and that a recovery is solidly underway, and my remarks today will be focused on the\noutlook for that recovery. Before I begin, however, I should note that these are my own views\nand should not be attributed to any other person in the Federal Reserve System. 1\nThe backdrop to our current situation is that we have experienced one of the steepest economic\ncontractions on record, driven by the plunge in housing market activity that followed the ten-year\nhousing boom that ended in 2005. During the boom home prices almost tripled, but by the\nmiddle of this decade evidence began to signal that the boom had gone too far. Vacancy rates\nbegan to hit record highs, and measures of home construction and sales activity began to fall\nprecipitously. Home prices also began to decline, reducing equity values and household wealth,\nand leading to rising defaults and foreclosures. After residential investment began to decline, the\nrest of the economy slowed and the expansion officially ended in December 2007. The recession\nthat followed was longer and deeper than any we have experienced since the 1930s. I could cite\na boatload of dismal statistics, but I’ll confine myself to one in particular – the number of people\nemployed has fallen by 7.3 million since it peaked at the end of 2007.\nThat’s the backdrop. The last few months’ data indicate that economic activity has begun to\nimprove. Starting with housing, several indicators of sales and construction activity hit low\npoints early this year and have risen modestly since then. For instance, single-family housing\nstarts have increased by 33 percent and new home sales have increased by 31 percent. And there\nare also signs that home prices have bottomed out as well. One widely followed index of existing\nhome prices nationwide rose a seasonally adjusted 3.7 percent from May to September. Even\nwith these welcome gains, however, housing activity remains well below the pace required to\naccommodate population and income growth on a sustained basis. That’s to be expected as we\nwork off the overhang of unsold homes in many parts of the country. But at least housing is no\nlonger a major drag on GDP growth, and in fact it should make positive contributions, in\nwelcome contrast to the last three years.\nConsumer purchases of cars and trucks also began to tail off in 2007 and then fell very sharply in\n2008. Sales hit a low point this past February and then increased very gradually before the “Cash\nfor Clunkers” program boosted sales in July and August. Clearly that program pulled forward\n\n\fmany sales that would have occurred anyway later this year, and so it was not surprising that\nsales fell back in September to about where they were in the spring. What caught many analysts\nby surprise, though, was the rebound in the sales rate in October. Granted, sales are still well\nbelow the long-run trend that would be needed to keep the stock of vehicles growing in line with\npopulation. But, just as with housing, autos are no longer a drag on GDP growth and should\nmake positive contributions going forward, again in welcome contrast to the last two years.\nAside from autos, real consumer spending fell slightly during the recession. But in the third\nquarter, consumer spending – apart from cars and trucks – reversed course and increased at a 1.7\npercent annual rate. This suggests that many U.S. households have recovered at least a modicum\nof confidence about their future income prospects.\nBusiness spending on new equipment and software fell a sharp 21 percent during the recession. It\nalso has reversed course and has registered a positive gain in the third quarter.\nIn addition to these favorable domestic developments, there has been a worldwide rebound in\neconomic activity, which is boosting demand in our export industries. As recently as the first\nquarter, real exports were falling at nearly a 30 percent annual rate; in the third quarter, they\nwere increasing at close to a 17 percent annual rate.\nToting up all these favorable demand side developments, the most recent estimate is that real\nGDP grew 2.8 percent in the third quarter, its most rapid growth since mid-2007. As a result,\nprominent academic and industry economists have proclaimed the end of the recession and are\nlooking forward to a lengthy period of sustained growth in overall economic activity. Those\nforecasts look quite reasonable to me. In the near term, production will receive a boost as a result\nof the shift underway from inventory liquidation to inventory accumulation. That boost to\nproduction will necessitate the hiring of new workers, which will add to households’ incomes.\nConsumers, having deferred many purchases during the recession, will respond to growing\nincomes with higher spending. This is typical of the period immediately following a recession,\nand this time should be no different.\nIndeed, we are seeing the first signs of improvement on the supply side. Industrial production has\nincreased for four straight months. While a significant part of the increase was due to a\nresumption of auto production by GM and Chrysler, even without autos, industrial production\nhas increased by a solid 1.9 percent over those four months. Moreover, a survey-based index\npublished by the Institute for Supply Management has risen substantially this year, and indicates\nthat the growth in manufacturing activity is spread broadly across different industries. The new\norders component of their index has registered even more impressive growth over that period.\nThese particular indexes have a 60-year track record of giving highly reliable signals on\nrecession and recovery, and we have no reason to suspect a break from past form.\nOne key element supporting the recovery is the significant improvement in financial conditions\nthat has occurred this year. Corporate borrowing costs have declined considerably, as interest\nrates on commercial paper and corporate bonds are now much lower than they were last year.\nMany major banks have sold stock successfully and now have the capital to support new lending,\neven if conditions turn out worse than expected. Although many borrowers naturally face\n-2-\n\n\ftougher credit terms in a soft economy, the banking system as a whole appears capable of\nsupporting business investment and expansion.\nWhile the outlook has brightened in recent months, we still face major economic challenges. In\ncommercial real estate, construction is falling, vacancy rates are rising, and falling property\nprices are eroding owners’ equity positions. Holders of commercial-mortgage-backed securities\nhave already taken sizeable losses, with more on the horizon as numerous projects are scheduled\nfor refinancing. And some community banks have lent heavily to commercial real estate\ndevelopers and are now facing rising delinquencies and losses. No one expects a quick reversal\nof these negative trends, and as a result, business investment in nonresidential structures is likely\nto be a substantial drag on U.S. growth in the near term.\nMore worrisome is the extremely weak labor market. The number of people employed has fallen\nfor 22 straight months. The unemployment rate has more than doubled, to a 10.2 percent rate.\nWages are under pressure; so far this year average hourly earnings have only risen at a 2.1\npercent annual rate, about half its rate in mid-2007. Going forward, as overall economic activity\ncontinues to improve, employment will bottom out and then begin to return to an upward\ntrajectory. Even the more optimistic forecasters, though, do not expect a rapid improvement in\nnational labor market conditions, and we will need to carefully monitor employment and\nearnings for an extended period.\nPutting the whole picture together, I think the most likely outcome is that the economy will grow\nat a reasonable pace next year – housing should continue to recover from a very depressed state,\nconsumers should gradually expand spending, business investment should make something of a\ncomeback, and these components of demand should overcome a continuing drag from\ncommercial construction.\nI’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation and monetary policy. Inflation has been running about\n1.5 percent recently, and from my point of view, that’s ideal. Earlier this year some economists\nwere highlighting the risk that the low level of economic activity could push the rate of inflation\ndown, perhaps even below zero. I think the risk of a substantial further reduction in inflation has\ndiminished substantially since then. In fact, we have seen that even in the early stage of a\nrecovery, inflation and inflation expectations can drift higher. The perception of inflation risk\ncould be particularly pertinent to the current recovery, given the massive and unprecedented\nexpansion in bank reserves that has occurred, and the widespread market commentary expressing\nuncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve is willing and able to promptly reverse that\nexpansion.\nAs a technical matter, I do not see any problem – we do have the tools to remove as much\nmonetary stimulus as necessary to keep inflation low and stable. The harder problem is the same\none that we face after every recession, which is choosing when and how rapidly to remove\nmonetary stimulus. There is no doubt that we must be aware of the danger of aborting a weak,\nuneven recovery if we tighten too soon. But if we hope to keep inflation in check, we cannot be\nparalyzed by patches of lingering weakness, which could persist well into the recovery. In\nassessing when we will need to begin taking monetary stimulus out, I will be looking for the time\nat which economic growth is strong enough and well-enough established, even if it is not yet\n-3-\n\n\fespecially vigorous. Although it is hard to predict when that will occur, I can confidently predict\nthat monetary policy will remain particularly challenging for some time to come.\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for assistance in preparing this speech.\n\n-4-\n\n\f",

            "content": "The Economic Outlook, November 2009\nVirginia House Appropriations Committee November 17, 2009\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you today and discuss the economic outlook. The\nCommonwealth of Virginia, like many other state governments across our country, faces a very\nchallenging fiscal environment as a result of the contraction in economic activity over the last\ntwo years. You have heard the news, no doubt, that most economists have declared that the\nrecession is over. What that means, however, is that the contraction has come to an end, not that\nall of our economic challenges are behind us. Indeed, this portion of the business cycle often\nposes the most acute fiscal problems at the state and local level due to the typical lag in incomes.\nHaving said that, I do agree that the national economy has hit bottom and that a recovery is\nsolidly underway, and my remarks today will be focused on the outlook for that recovery. To put\nthe current outlook in context, I’d like to start by briefly reviewing the recent recession and how\nwe got here. Before I begin, however, I should note that these are my own views and should not\nbe attributed to any other person in the Federal Reserve System.1\nIn my view, the boom/bust cycle in housing was the central driving force in this recession.\nRobust demand increased the fraction of our nation’s economic resources devoted to residential\ninvestment by about 50 percent from 1995 to 2005. Part of that demand growth can be explained\nby healthy fundamentals such as strong income gains and low long-term interest rates. Another\nkey driver was the strong public policy commitment to boost home ownership, which was\nreflected in the favorable tax treatment of homeowners, the implicit subsidies flowing to the\ngovernment-sponsored housing-finance enterprises, and the mandate they were given to expand\nlow-income mortgage lending. In addition, innovations in mortgage lending and securitization\nhelped to bring home ownership within reach of a wider segment of the population. This\nexpansion in access to credit has benefitted many Americans, but in retrospect we can see that it\nwas accompanied by lax underwriting standards and overly complex and opaque securitization.\nMoreover, many borrowers, lenders, investors and analysts acted as if housing prices were\ncertain to appreciate over time. In short, the housing boom appears to have been driven by a\ncombination of fundamentals, government incentives and a degree of overshooting.\nDuring the boom home prices almost tripled, but by the middle of this decade evidence began to\nsignal that the boom had gone too far. Vacancy rates began to hit record highs, and measures of\nhome construction and sales activity began to fall precipitously. Home prices also began to\ndecline, reducing equity values and household wealth, and leading to rising defaults and\nforeclosures.\nAfter residential investment began to decline, the rest of the economy slowed and the expansion\nofficially ended in December 2007. The recession that followed was longer and deeper than any\nwe have experienced since the 1930s. I could cite a boatload of dismal statistics, but I’ll confine\n\n\fmyself to one in particular – the number of people employed has fallen by 7.3 million since it\npeaked at the end of 2007.\nThat’s the backdrop. The last few months’ data indicate that economic activity has begun to\nimprove. Starting with housing, several indicators of sales and construction activity hit low\npoints early this year and have risen modestly since then. For instance, single-family housing\nstarts have increased by 40 percent and new home sales have increased by 22 percent. And there\nare also signs that home prices have bottomed out as well. One widely followed index of existing\nhome prices nationwide rose a seasonally adjusted 3.3 percent in June, July and August. Even\nwith these welcome gains, however, housing activity remains well below the pace required to\naccommodate population and income growth on a sustained basis. That’s to be expected as we\nwork off the overhang of unsold homes in many parts of the country. But at least housing is no\nlonger a major drag on GDP growth, and in fact it should make positive contributions, in\nwelcome contrast to the last three years.\nThe boom-bust cycle in Virginia’s housing markets was characterized by a somewhat smaller\nswing in home construction than for the nation as a whole, and a correspondingly larger swing in\nhome prices. That said, housing market activity in the Commonwealth has stabilized at a low\nlevel, and should no longer be a drag on growth.\nConsumer purchases of cars and trucks also began to tail off in 2007 and then fell very sharply in\n2008. Sales hit a low point this past February and then increased very gradually before the “Cash\nfor Clunkers” program boosted sales in July and August. Clearly that program pulled forward\nmany sales that would have occurred anyway later this year, and so it was not surprising that\nsales fell back in September to about where they were in the spring. What caught many analysts\nby surprise, though, was the rebound in the sales rate in October. Granted, sales are still well\nbelow the long-run trend that would be needed to keep the stock of vehicles growing in line with\npopulation. But, just as with housing, autos are no longer a drag on GDP growth and should\nmake positive contributions going forward, again in welcome contrast to the last two years.\nAside from autos, real consumer spending fell 2 percent during the recession. But in the third\nquarter, consumer spending – apart from cars and trucks – reversed course and increased at a 1.8\npercent annual rate. This suggests that many U.S. households have recovered at least a modicum\nof confidence about their future income prospects.\nBusiness spending on new investments in equipment and software fell a sharp 21 percent during\nthe recession. It also has reversed course and has registered a small positive gain in the third\nquarter.\nIn addition to these favorable domestic developments, there has been a worldwide rebound in\neconomic activity, which is boosting demand in our export industries. As recently as the first\nquarter, real exports were falling at nearly a 30 percent annual rate; in the third quarter, they\nwere increasing at close to a 15 percent annual rate.\nToting up all these favorable demand side developments, the advance estimate of real GDP grew\n3.5 percent in the third quarter, its most rapid growth since mid-2007. Prominent academic and\n‐2‐\n\n\findustry economists have proclaimed the end of the recession and are looking forward to a\nlengthy period of sustained growth in overall economic activity. Those forecasts look quite\nreasonable to me. In the near term, production will receive a boost as a result of the shift\nunderway from inventory liquidation to inventory accumulation. That boost in production will\nnecessitate the hiring of new workers, which will add to households’ incomes. Consumers,\nhaving deferred many purchases during the recession, will respond to growing incomes with\nhigher spending. This is typical of the period immediately following a recession, and this time\nshould be no different.\nIndeed, we are seeing the first signs of improvement on the supply side. Industrial production\nincreased for three straight months leading up to September. While a significant part of the\nincrease was due to a resumption of auto production by GM and Chrysler, even without autos,\nindustrial production has increased by a solid 1.8 percent over those three months. Moreover, a\nsurvey-based index published by the Institute for Supply Management has risen substantially this\nyear, and indicates that the growth in manufacturing activity is spread broadly across different\nindustries. The new orders component of their index has registered even more impressive growth\nover that period. These particular indexes have a 60-year track record of giving highly reliable\nsignals on recession and recovery, and we have no reason to suspect a break from past form.\nOne key element supporting the recovery is the significant improvement in financial conditions\nthat has occurred this year. Corporate borrowing costs have declined considerably, as interest\nrates on commercial paper and corporate bonds are now much lower than they were last year.\nMany major banks have sold stock successfully and now have the capital to support new lending,\neven if conditions turn out worse than expected. Although many borrowers naturally face\ntougher credit terms in a soft economy, the banking system as a whole appears capable of\nsupporting business investment and expansion.\nWhile the outlook has brightened in recent months, we still face major challenges. Commercial\nreal estate construction is falling, vacancy rates are rising and falling property prices are eroding\nowners’ equity positions. Holders of commercial-mortgage-backed securities have already taken\nsizeable losses, with more on the horizon as numerous projects are scheduled for refinancing.\nAnd some community banks have lent heavily to commercial real estate developers and are now\nfacing rising delinquencies and losses. No one expects a quick reversal of these negative trends,\nand as a result, business investment in nonresidential structures is likely to be a substantial drag\non U.S. growth in the near term. The outlook for commercial construction in Virginia is similar,\nthough perhaps marginally better due to the stabilizing effect of demand for government and\ncontractor office space around the District of Columbia.\nMore worrisome is the extremely weak labor market. The number of people employed has fallen\nfor 22 straight months. The unemployment rate has more than doubled, to a 10.2 percent rate.\nWages are under pressure; so far this year average hourly earnings have only risen at a 2.1\npercent at an annual rate, about half its rate in mid-2007. Going forward, as overall economic\nactivity continues to improve, employment will bottom out and then begin to return to an upward\ntrajectory. Even the more optimistic forecasters, though, do not expect a rapid improvement in\nnational labor market conditions, and we will need to carefully monitor employment and\nearnings for an extended period.\n‐3‐\n\n\fVirginia’s labor market has fared somewhat better than the rest of the nation’s this year; payroll\nemployment has not fallen as rapidly, and the unemployment rate has topped out already and\nedged down to 6.7 percent as of September. As a result, total personal income has not fallen as\nrapidly over the last year for Virginia as it has for the nation as a whole, and I expect labor\nmarket conditions to improve a bit sooner and less slowly than the rest of the U.S.\nPutting the whole picture together, I think the most likely outcome is that the economy will grow\nat a reasonable pace next year – housing should continue to recover from a very depressed state,\nconsumers should gradually expand spending, business investment should make something of a\ncomeback, and these components of demand should overcome a continuing drag from\ncommercial construction. Virginia should continue to track the national trends and may even\noutperform the nation, as it has in previous expansions.\nI’ll conclude with some thoughts on inflation and monetary policy. Inflation has been running\nabout 1.5 percent recently, and from my point of view, that’s ideal. Earlier this year some\neconomists were highlighting the risk that the low level of economic activity could push the rate\nof inflation down, perhaps even below zero. I think the risk of a substantial further reduction in\ninflation has diminished substantially since then. The historical record suggests that the early\nyears of a recovery are when the risk is greatest that confidence in the stability of inflation erodes\nand we see an upward drift in inflation and inflation expectations. This risk could be particularly\npertinent to the current recovery, given the massive and unprecedented expansion in bank\nreserves that has occurred, and the widespread market commentary expressing uncertainty over\nwhether the Federal Reserve is willing and able to promptly reverse that expansion.\nAs a technical matter, I do not see any problem – we do have the tools to remove as much\nmonetary stimulus as necessary to keep inflation low and stable. The harder problem is the same\none that we face after every recession, which is choosing when and how rapidly to remove\nmonetary stimulus. There is no doubt that we must be aware of the danger of aborting a weak,\nuneven recovery if we tighten too soon. But if we hope to keep inflation in check, we cannot be\nparalyzed by patches of lingering weakness, which could persist well into the recovery. In\nassessing when we will need to begin taking monetary stimulus out, I will be looking for the time\nat which economic growth is strong enough and well-enough established, even if it is not yet\nespecially vigorous. Although it is hard to predict when that will occur, I can confidently predict\nthat economic policymaking, both for you and for me, will remain particularly challenging for\nsome time to come.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for assistance in preparing this speech.\n\n‐4‐\n\n\f",

            "content": "Financial Education in the Wake of the Crisis\nCouncil for Economic Education\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 8, 2009\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nThe past year has been tumultuous for our nation’s financial system, for our economy,\nand, of course, for many of our citizens. Financial transactions entered into by those\ncitizens, and the financial market securities derived from those transactions, were at the\nheart of the turmoil. With the economy and financial markets apparently on a recovery\npath, this is a good time to reflect on the meaning of this whole episode for financial\neducation. In particular, what lessons should educators take away to help people make\nmore informed financial choices, not only today but throughout their lifetimes?1\nI don’t intend to prescribe specific curricula changes or pedagogical approaches. But I\nwould like to offer some more general thoughts on what I think would be a useful\ndirection to take as we learn more about the causes of the financial crisis – and about the\ndecisions made by households during the period leading up to the crisis. As always, the\nviews expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nBefore discussing potential new directions for financial education, I would like to pose a\nfundamental question: Why do we need financial education at all? This might seem\nobvious. But I don’t think it necessarily is – and I think the answers may help us frame\nthe broader discussion.\nFor many purposes, economists find it useful to assume that people are rational and that\nthey will acquire the information necessary to make decisions that will benefit them and\ntheir families. And there certainly is plenty of financial information and advice out there\n– as anyone who has seen cable television knows. The problem is, not all that information\nis necessarily helpful, especially given the varying financial situations in which people\nfind themselves. Moreover, many information providers are far from disinterested. As a\nresult, it can be difficult for individuals to distinguish “good” information from “bad”\ninformation. Financial education can help consumers make well-considered judgments\nabout the financial information they hear or read.\nRelated, when consumers buy durable goods, such as a car or a refrigerator, they are\noften able to rely on information from friends who have made similar purchases. What’s\nmore, these are products that they, themselves, will buy multiple times in their own\nlifetimes. So there is an opportunity for learning. In contrast, a home mortgage is a less\nfrequent transaction – and one that people often don’t discuss in detail with others.\n\n1\n\n\fIn addition, the nature of many financial instruments is fundamentally different than that\nof many durable items. For instance, we don’t need to understand thermodynamics to buy\na suitable refrigerator. But we do need to know a fair amount about the terms of a\nmortgage contract – and what that will mean for our overall financial wellbeing in\nvarious circumstances – in order to make a sound decision about financing a home.\nFinally, while a refrigerator is an expensive item, it is unlikely to be a purchase that will\nput someone in financial peril. This is unlike some financial products that can, indeed,\nhave significant and long-lasting effects. So consumers need to pay careful attention to\nthose decisions and seek out the requisite information to make a choice that is good for\nthem. This is a point that I will return to later.\nEducation or Regulation, or Both?\nAs you know, there is a relatively widespread belief that a lack of regulation was to\nblame for the financial crisis – especially, perhaps, in mortgage lending. Proponents of\nthis argument commonly argue that consumers would be made better off if there were\ntighter constraints on the set of financial products that they can obtain. To be sure, there\nwere some unscrupulous mortgage lenders who did not act in the best interests of the\nborrowers and investors they were supposed to serve. But it is also the case that financial\ninnovation – including innovation in the mortgage industry – has benefited consumers. It\nallowed many people to obtain credit who were previously unable to qualify for credit.\nThis allowed them an expanded range of financial options for rearranging their spending\nover time in a way that best suited them.\nBut to many observers, some of those financial choices may seem to make little sense.\nConsider, for instance, a person with little savings who takes out a high-interest loan to\nfund car repairs. This will be a costly endeavor, one that might appear misguided. But it\nmay be money well spent if the car is necessary to get to work, especially if the job\nprovides health insurance. Someone with greater wealth may have been able to fund the\nrepairs out of savings, clearly a more desirable option, but one that is not available to\nevery consumer. So it is often difficult to judge the merits of an individual’s financial\ndecision without knowing the circumstances that household is facing.2\nStill, people do make bad decisions at times, and a lack of information is often the root\ncause. Sometimes this information is what economists call “asymmetric”– that is, one\nparty has far more information than the other party. With financial products, it is usually\nthe provider that has more information about specific provisions in the contract, in which\ncase they may have an incentive to distort or obscure that information.3 This can place the\nconsumer in a vulnerable position that may result in a choice that turns out poorly. How\ndo we help solve such information asymmetries? I would suggest through a balanced\ncombination of sensible regulation and financial education.\nDisclosure requirements are an obvious place to start. Some financial products can be\nquite complex and difficult to understand, even for relatively savvy consumers. Making\nthe terms of a contract, for instance, clear and explicit is likely to improve many\n\n2\n\n\fconsumers’ ability to make an informed decision about that contract and to evaluate\nalternatives.\nThe Federal Reserve recently adopted a series of rule changes to improve disclosure\nrequirements for a range of consumer financial products. Many of these changes were\nbased on the results of consumer testing, a typical private sector practice in designing\nconsumer communications. One common lesson of such testing is that, paradoxically,\ndisclosure requirements may be most beneficial if less information is disclosed. Home\nmortgage disclosures are a case in point. After all, the current housing boom and decline\noccurred in an era when lenders were required to disclose a huge amount of information\nto borrowers. It is arguable that if only the most significant terms of those mortgages had\nbeen disclosed – or at least highlighted – consumers may have been able to more easily\nevaluate their merits.4\nWell-designed disclosure requirements are likely to improve the functioning of markets\nrather than hindering them, and improve consumer welfare. But regulations that would\nlimit consumers’ ability to access financial products – even those products that may\nappear detrimental to some consumers at first blush, such as the high interest loan\nexample I noted before – may harm the very people they were intended to protect. In\naddition, it is quite possible that, in the longer run, firms will develop new financial\nproducts to bypass existing regulations and households will be confronted with decisions\nregarding those products before the regulatory structure can catch up.\nSo I would prefer to see more emphasis on giving people the information they need in a\nclear and understandable format – especially targeted information that will help them to\navoid making serious errors – rather than restricting their access to financial products.\nWhat Should Be the Focus of Financial Education?\nYou may remember the 1987 movie Wall Street with Michael Douglas as the ruthless\nGordon Gekko and Charlie Sheen as the naïve but ambitious Bud Fox. In it, there is a\nscene where Fox is about to walk into Gekko’s office for the first time and he says to\nhimself, “Life all comes down to a few moments. This is one of them.” Now, I am not\nadvocating that Wall Street become required viewing in financial education classes. But\nthere is a lot of truth in that quote, in the sense that a few key decisions have the potential\nto shape the future path of our lives. In those cases, it is important that we make the\ncorrect choice – or, perhaps more importantly, avoid a really bad choice. The same is true\nof personal finances as well. A lot rides on a few key decisions: whether or not to pursue\nhigher education; whether or not to purchase a house and, if so, on what terms; and how\nto best save for retirement. I believe that financial education should focus on those key\ndecisions, ones that will have large and potentially long-lasting effects on people’s lives.\nConsider education. Wage inequality has been growing in the United States since the late\n1970s. While there are many potential causes of this trend, the one that I believe is\ncontributing to it most significantly is skill-biased technical change.5 That is,\ntechnological progress over the last few decades has increased the productivity of skilled\n\n3\n\n\fworkers more rapidly than it has of less-skilled workers. As a result, the financial returns\nto accumulating skills have grown significantly. Often – though not always – those skills\nare obtained through higher education. Investments in human capital can prove more\nuseful if they are made at a relatively early age, giving people the opportunity to recoup\ntheir investment throughout the majority of their working lives. In addition, such training\ntends to build on itself, because acquiring skills early in life makes it easier to acquire\nadditional skills later in life. The evidence is clear that, over time, higher education has\nbecome a more significant determinant of lifetime earnings. This suggests that it is\nparticularly important that high school students fully understand these dynamics as they\nconsider which path to take following graduation.\nI already talked a bit about home purchases and the importance of properly evaluating the\nsuitability of one’s mortgage. But I think it is also important to note that homeownership\nitself is not a wise choice for everybody. For example, for those who value mobility and\nare apt to move relatively frequently to pursue better job opportunities, the search and\ntransaction costs of purchasing a house can be prohibitively large. More critically,\npurchasing a home usually means sinking a considerable amount of a household’s\nsavings into a single asset that is often costly to trade. This move may be particularly\nrisky for a household with a variable income stream and low levels of savings, as is true\nof many low-income households. When one considers such factors, I think it becomes\nclear that renting does not necessarily mean “throwing your money away,” as is\ncommonly suggested. It is simply another way to consume housing stock, one that is\nappropriate for some households, just as buying is for others. Given the financial risks\nassociated with homeownership, as highlighted by the events of this decade, it should be\nclear that educating people about the homeownership decision is particularly important.\nPlanning for retirement involves a hard set of choices as well, which, if not done\ncarefully, can lead to painful results. In the aftermath of this recession, which has seen\nmany workers postpone their impending retirement, the importance of accounting for a\nrange of plausible risks should be clear. Given the differences in how people wish to live\nin retirement – that is, whether they want more, less, or roughly the same annual spending\nas when they were working – it is hard to say much in the abstract about what is an\n“optimal” retirement plan. But I think everyone would benefit from understanding that\nthere generally is good reason to shift your retirement portfolio from more risky to less\nrisky assets as one grows older. This understanding might have helped prevent some of\nthe considerable losses in retirement funds that some consumers have unfortunately\nexperienced.\nFinancial Education as Economic Education\nThe three examples I gave above all involve overtly financial decisions, specifically those\nthat will have a significant impact on nearly every household’s financial wellbeing. But at\ntheir core, they are about fundamental economic principles. As such, I believe we should\nthink of financial education and economic education as being inherently intertwined.\nHow, for instance, does one adequately consider home buying versus renting without\nunderstanding the concept of opportunity cost? Or similarly, in order to understand why\n\n4\n\n\fthere is now a wage premium in the United States associated with greater skills, it is\nuseful to understand the theory of comparative advantage. This isn’t to say that financial\neducation is only about economic education – clearly it isn’t, but economic education is\nan important component.\nConversely, I might add, it’s hard to imagine teaching about the recent financial crisis\nwithout coming across the opportunity to discuss financial decisions like financing a\nhome, or saving for retirement. More generally, it’s hard to teach economics without\nteaching about how to make financial decisions.\nAs for how best to implement such programs, my reading of the literature suggests that\nthere is still no professional consensus. There are ongoing efforts within the Federal\nReserve System to measure how some of the Fed’s financial education programs have\nfared and which have been most successful in achieving their intended outcomes. I hope\nthose results will be useful to people in this room as you continue your efforts to help\npeople achieve their financial goals – and to avoid mistakes that could prove financially\ncrippling.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Aaron Steelman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nFor example, see Edward S.

This gives rise to an array of\nconsiderations that are beyond our scope here.\n4\nSee Kartik B.

            "content": "Choices in Financial Regulation\nCharlotte Risk Management Association\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nSeptember 14, 2009\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThe last time I addressed this group – August 21, 2007 – marked the beginning of a tumultuous\nperiod. 1 The two years since then have been marked by repeated waves of turmoil in financial\nmarkets and extraordinary actions by the authorities. As counterparties retreated from various\nmarket segments, governments and central banks worldwide responded by providing\nunprecedented levels of credit and credit guarantees, the broad effect of which has been to shield\nmany creditors from losses.\nIn the wake of this “Crisis of 2007, 2008 and 2009” Congress is weighing proposals that would\nsignificantly restructure financial regulation in the United States. Central to the plans being\ndiscussed are stricter regulation of institutions and markets deemed to be systemically important\nand new governmental resolution authority for large, complex, nonbank financial institutions.\nParticipants in the recent G-20 meetings, for instance, endorsed the notion of increased capital\nrequirements for such companies. Given the broad and deep official support the financial sector\nhas received, stiffer capital standards are warranted in order to better align incentives and protect\ntaxpayer interests. But I think it also is worth questioning whether we need to take the level of\nofficial support as given.\nIn 1993, my predecessor Al Broaddus gave a speech entitled “Choices in Banking Policy,” in\nwhich he outlined the tradeoffs between reliance on market forces to align banks’ incentives and\nreliance on regulation and supervision to constrain banks’ risk taking. 2 I intend to take up this\nsubject again today in the light of recent events; but as always, the views expressed are my own,\nand are not the official views of the Federal Reserve System. Broaddus’s speech came just a few\nyears after another major U.S. financial crisis, and though the environment was very different,\nthe tradeoffs he identified are just as relevant today as we consider reforming our regulatory\nstructure. The more we rely on government guarantees of private-sector financial liabilities as\nour main defense against financial market disruption, the more we must regulate private risk\nmanagement to offset the adverse incentive effects of that safety net. But by the same token,\nmeaningful market discipline requires a credible government commitment to not shield private\ncounterparties of large financial intermediaries from credit losses.\nIn this crisis, the official response has been to expand the scale and scope of public sector\nsupport, initially in the form of Federal Reserve lending, and later in the form of capital\nassistance for financial firms from the U.S. Treasury and guarantees on newly issued debt by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This response came in an attempt to make sound choices\nin an ever-deteriorating sequence of situations. At each moment of crisis, it is hard to argue with\nthe proposition that losses to the creditors of a large, interconnected financial firm pose\nsignificant risks to the financial system and the broader economy. But the cumulative effect of\nthese actions has been to solidify long-held beliefs by many market participants that large,\n1\n\n\finterconnected financial firms will be viewed by policymakers as “too-big-to-fail,” or at least too\nbig to fail in a way that imposes substantial losses on creditors. These beliefs have evolved over\na number of decades, through a series of actions that included the bailout of Continental Illinois\nNational Bank and Trust in 1984, regulatory forbearance for banks that became undercapitalized\nfrom losses related to the debt of less developed countries in the 1980s, and the private sector\nrescue of Long Term Capital Management orchestrated by the New York Fed in 1998. While this\nlast action involved no public sector funding, it clearly signaled an official concern for the\ndisruption that could follow an outright default. 3\nThe result is an environment in which there is both broad agreement on the need for stronger\nregulatory oversight of financial markets and institutions and widespread dissatisfaction with the\nscale of the official financial support the crisis has seemed to require. So we seem to face the\nsame fundamental choice that my predecessor described 16 years ago: more regulation or more\nmarket discipline? The leading proposals before Congress concentrate almost exclusively on\nexpanding government protection and regulation, but I believe we would be better off placing\ngreater reliance on market-based incentives for prudent risk management.\nWhat Financial Markets Do\nFinancial markets are fundamental to the way an economy allocates its scarce resources to their\nmost productive uses. The markets and institutions that make up our financial system collect the\nsavings of households and businesses and reallocate those funds to other households and\nbusinesses – as well as governments – who seek to finance additional current consumption or\ninvestment spending.\nThe possible uses of funds are many and diverse, varying both in expected outcomes and in risk.\nThe conventional view of a market mechanism is that competition among alternative users of\nfunds, through prices offered and bid, will tend to allocate those resources to their best uses,\ntaking into account both risk and return. In doing so, markets also bring together the disparate\nknowledge of various market participants, none of which has a complete picture of the array of\navailable investment opportunities. These two functions of financial markets – allocating\nresources and aggregating information – are clearly interdependent. After all, how can you\ndistribute funds to their best uses without knowing something about the relative risks and\nrewards of various alternatives?\nFinancial markets do not perform these functions perfectly. Limits to the information held by\nindividual market participants and incompleteness in the range of financial instruments and\nmarkets available for trading risks and rewards mean that markets may not achieve the same\nresults that could be realized by the – hypothetical – omniscient central decision maker in\neconomists’ models. Indeed, such informational limits appear to motivate many types of\nfinancial intermediaries and a host of other financial market features. But these same\nimperfections mean that it is likely to be very hard to find a way to systematically improve on\nmarket outcomes, because the same informational limits are likely to apply to the real world\npolicymaker, who lacks the theoretical omniscience of the economist’s fictional decision maker.\nWhat Financial Safety Nets Do\n2\n\n\fGovernment guarantees of private debt – either explicit or implicit – can have profound effects\non debtors’ and creditors’ incentives to appropriately price and manage risk exposures. These\neffects are likely to have been particularly acute for the large institutions that were at the heart of\nthis crisis and viewed as too big to fail. 4 Their creditors will see their own risks as at least\npartially reduced by the explicit or implicit government guarantees, and will therefore require\nless of a risk premium and impose fewer covenant restrictions than they otherwise would.\nInexpensive debt financing will encourage an institution to seek greater leverage than it\notherwise would, and increased leverage, in turn, makes an institution less averse to taking large\nrisks, other things being equal.\nMeasuring the effects of the safety net on incentives for risk management is difficult. But\nmeasuring the safety net itself is possible. Research by Richmond Fed economists showed that in\n1999 about 27 percent of all of the liabilities of firms in the U.S. financial sector were explicitly\nguaranteed by the federal government. 5 By their estimate, another 18 percent enjoyed at least\nsome implicit support, or were likely to be perceived by markets to have such support, so a total\nof 45 percent of financial sector liabilities had at least implicit government backing. This was a\nconservative estimate of implicit guarantees, consisting basically of the government-sponsored\nenterprises and the uninsured deposits of the largest banks. In the course of the current crisis,\nexplicit guarantee programs have grown, for instance through the expansion of deposit insurance.\nAn estimate of the implicit safety net guarantees would also no doubt be larger today, as we have\nseen protection temporarily extended to nondeposit creditors of banks and other financial\ninstitutions. So it seems likely that a substantially larger fraction of the financial sector is now\noperating under the effects of the safety net.\nThe scale and scope of the financial safety net should be matched by the scale and scope of the\nregulatory and supervisory regime surrounding financial institutions. The central role of\nprudential regulation is to constrain and prevent the excessive risk-taking that would otherwise\nbe induced by the incentive effects of safety net support. Capital regulations, for example, limit\nleverage, and supervisory oversight of financial institutions’ risk management systems seeks to\nassure that senior management – and supervisors – understand the risks the institution takes. The\ndramatic recent expansion of government support for financial institutions and markets has\nenlarged the safety net to well beyond the scope of the previous regulatory regime. If no\ncorrective action is taken to close that gap, the next economic expansion will likely see more\nexcessive risk-taking and end with more firms in financial distress.\nThe Origins of the Crisis, Revisited\nThe basic choice we face in restructuring financial regulation is this: To what extent do we\nexpand regulatory constraints to catch up with an expanded safety net and to what extent do we\nlimit the safety net and rely on market incentives? Based on the experience of the last several\nyears, it may be tempting to conclude that a market-based approach has failed and needs to be\nreplaced by tougher regulatory constraints. This, after all, is the popular narrative which portrays\nthe financial crisis as the inevitable aftermath of an inherent tendency towards excessive risktaking in unregulated financial markets.\n\n3\n\n\fBut market incentives have been seriously distorted for some time by beliefs about the financial\nsafety net. In fact, I believe that the incentive effects of the financial safety net added to the\nvulnerability of financial institutions and contributed significantly to the housing boom and\nsubsequent bust. 6 Perceptions that some financial institutions were too-big-to-fail, including the\nhousing-related government sponsored enterprises, reduced their cost of debt and capital and\nhelped spur innovations in securitization and risk distribution which ultimately posed challenges\nfor our regulatory apparatus. Those institutions enjoyed an artificial advantage in providing\nguarantees and backstop liquidity support through off-balance-sheet entities, support which\nwould prove most valuable during times of financial distress, when ostensibly off-balance-sheet\nassets would “boomerang” back onto bank balance sheets. And during the financial turbulence of\nthe housing bust, the prospect of official support blunted the incentives of many financial firms\nand their creditors to protect themselves against the possibility of “runs” or “panics” that might\nlead to disruptive failures. 7\nTwo Paths\nThe extent to which decades of policy precedents led to growing expectations of official support\nin instances of financial distress suggests a view of this financial crisis that is different from the\npopular narrative. Successive crises elicited broadened support, but this case-by-case evolution\nmakes it hard to characterize just what limits, if any, there are to safety net support to large\nfinancial firms at any one time. The resulting uncertainty itself can be a source of volatility when\nfinancial distress looms as market participants are forced to speculate on the likelihood of a\nrescue. That uncertainty can create further pressure to bail out a distressed firm to avoid\ndisappointing expectations and a sharp pullback by investors from other firms. The result has\nbeen an ever growing expectation of support, a dynamic which my former colleague Marvin\nGoodfriend and I wrote about 10 years ago. 8\nOne key, therefore, to improving financial market performance is greater clarity about safety net\npolicy. We should seek to identify and articulate clear and credible limits to our willingness to\nshield private creditors from loss. This necessarily means taking steps to limit discretion in the\nmidst of financial disturbances. To understand why, put yourself in the position of a creditor of a\nlarge financial institution and ask yourself the following question: “If, in spite of the\ngovernment’s best regulatory efforts, this institution finds itself on the brink of a financial crisis,\nthreatening the failure of an array of institutions, how are the authorities likely to respond?” If\nthe answer involves expanded protection to that institution, then market discipline has been\nweakened. And if the nature of the authorities’ response has not been made clear ahead of time,\nthen financial market volatility is likely to be greater as well.\nThis is a relevant question because regulatory restraint on bank risk taking can never be perfect.\nRegulators, who as I said lack the omniscience of the economic theorist, cannot prevent the\nfailure of all large complex financial institutions, nor should they attempt to do so. In the\npresence of a substantial safety net, competition will drive firms to seek innovative ways to take\non leveraged risks and to bypass regulatory constraints. A market participant might then\nreasonably assume that regulators will successfully manage routine risks, while novel,\nnonroutine risks that result from financial innovations are likely to be more difficult to manage\n\n4\n\n\fand afforded special protection. And it is nonroutine, innovation-related risks that have been the\nsource of past crises and will likely be the source of future crises.\nThe case for the discretionary use of public funds rests on the desire to head off the costly effects\nthat might result from a large firm’s unassisted failure. Many have pointed to the market turmoil\nthat followed the Lehman Brothers failure last September as an example of such effects. But the\ngeneral distress on the days and weeks that followed was a response to many things. The news of\nLehman’s failure alone, quite apart from how that failure was resolved, was clearly relevant to\ncreditors of other financial institutions with mortgage-related exposures. That information was\ngoing to be revealed in any case, and in fact one would actually want it absorbed quickly in the\nprices of other financial assets for the financial system to function effectively. Another important\ncomponent in the market response to Lehman was undoubtedly the unexpected nature of the\ngovernment’s treatment of Lehman, given the actions that had come before in the period since\nthe summer of 2007. Market participants marked down the probability they attached to future\nrescues, and no doubt further revised those probabilities (both up and down) many times in the\ndays that followed. The argument for scaling back the safety net is not an argument for safety net\nuncertainty. Rather, it is an argument that we should both create expectations about the limits of\nassistance and take actions that validate those expectations. The real lesson from Lehman, in my\nview, is that officials should make a clear commitment about what institutions they will not\nsupport.\nOne focus in recent discussions of financial regulatory restructuring has been the process for\nresolving the failure of large financial firms, including firms without bank charters. This focus is\nappropriate, because beliefs about the safety net are really beliefs about what happens to large\nfirms in financial stress. One proposal is to establish a new federal “resolution authority” to\nhandle the failure of a large financial firm during times of stress. A failing financial firm could\nbe taken into conservatorship or receivership, and the Treasury (or some other federal agency)\nwould be able to provide loans, guarantees, or capital to the firm, or buy assets from the firm.\nThe intent is to provide for a less disruptive alternative to a bankruptcy filing, with the hope that\nsuch an authority can be credibly expected to impose appropriate losses on the firm’s creditors.\nThe description of this proposed resolution authority leaves it unclear how it would establish\nsuch a credible commitment. The proposal involves two distinct features. One is to provide for\nan alternative to the provisions of bankruptcy law as a resolution mechanism for a large financial\nfirm with many creditors. I would not be surprised if a close look at the bankruptcy code in light\nof recent events reveals worthwhile improvement opportunities. But the proposed resolution\nauthority would be distinct from established bankruptcy mechanisms. In addition, it would have\nthe discretion to use public funds to shield creditors from losses, a feature that I believe will\nseverely limit the benefit from reforming the resolution process. A widespread belief that public\nfunds will soften the blow to private creditors would weaken market discipline and further\ncomplicate the task of regulators. Moreover, uncertainty about whether such an authority will\nintervene to supersede the provisions of bankruptcy law and which creditors will benefit from\npublic funds is likely to intensify financial market turmoil in the event stresses arise.\nEffective resolution reform should limit the discretionary use of public funds. Federal Reserve\nlending has played a prominent role in this crisis and has been expanded far beyond the\n5\n\n\fboundaries that previously were believed to constrain it. Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve\nAct allows Reserve Banks, with the permission of the Board of Governors, to lend to any\nindividual, partnership or corporation, provided the circumstances are “unusual and exigent,” and\nthe borrower is “unable to secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking\ninstitutions.” 9 This provision was rarely invoked before 2008, but now that it has, we should seek\nto clarify how we want people to expect it to be used in the future. Successfully solidifying these\nexpectations may require rewriting Section 13(3). I would favor revisions that specify more\nclearly the circumstances in which the Fed can extend such credit and forms that such credit can\ntake. For instance, I previously have suggested limiting the Fed’s emergency loans to duration of\na few days, after which further funding would become the responsibility of the Treasury. 10\nBut limiting discretion does not stop with the Fed. Decisions and actions of a separate resolution\nauthority should be judged against a clear and simple benchmark process for closing down firms\nand paying off creditors – a benchmark that involves minimal use of public funds. This might\nresemble the FDIC’s “least cost resolution” mandate. This provision of the FDIC Improvement\nAct, while not always binding, does provide a simple basic option against which to assess\nalternatives.\nI have focused a bit more so far on reforms related to the failure resolution process than on those\nrelating to the on-going regulation and supervision of financial firms and markets. This is not out\nof complacency about our current regulatory regime. Federal Reserve staff have been devoting\nsubstantial time and effort to implementing improvements to our supervisory processes that were\nsuggested by a thorough review of the lessons learned from this episode. Rather, I believe that,\nwhatever we do to enhance prudential regulation, our efforts will be undercut if we do not also\nseek to rein in the incentives created by expectations of limitless safety net protection in financial\nmarkets. How well we curtail those expectations rests crucially on how clear we can be about\nwhat happens when financial firms face distress, because inevitably, in a dynamic economy,\nsome institutions will fail. Only by setting credible bounds on the safety net can we expect\nprivate-sector incentives to align at all with the public interest in sound risk management.\nThe transition to a narrower safety net is likely to be quite difficult. By itself, merely announcing\nthe intention to restrict support to a predetermined field and allowing uncovered institutions to\nfail without assistance will not necessarily be credible. If actions speak louder than words, as is\noften the case, then officials will have to demonstrate their commitment by imposing costly and\npainful losses on creditors. 11 Perhaps this is why there are those who seem resigned to an\nexpansive safety net, and are limiting their attention to providing additional tools so that\npolicymakers can resolve a broader range of cases without resorting to bankruptcy. But this\nseems likely to increase rather than decrease the likelihood of future financial market turbulence.\nThe wider we cast the net, the greater the incentives of market participants to evade regulatory\nconstraints while still availing themselves of protection in situations of distress, leading to a\ncontinuing cycle of crisis and bail out. And I have a hard time believing that we really need a\npublicly funded financial-institution support system covering nearly half of the liabilities in our\ncredit markets. So I believe that ultimately the benefits of a much more limited regime will come\nto be more widely appreciated. Perhaps our choices in financial regulation are really more about\nwhen than what.\n\n6\n\n\f1\n\nI am grateful for the assistance of John Weinberg in preparing this speech.\nJ.

            "content": "The Economic Outlook, August, 2009\nDanville Chamber of Commerce\nDanville, Virginia\nAugust 27, 2009\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nIt’s a pleasure to speak on the economic outlook today, because after many months I am finally\nable to say with a reasonable degree of confidence that the outlook is improving. We’ve endured the\nworst downturn that the economy has experienced in most of our lifetimes, and conditions remain\ndistressed in many industries and localities. Yet the economy appears to have leveled out and I believe\nwe can look forward to better times ahead.\nBefore discussing this outlook in more detail, I’d like to provide my perspective on the\ndevelopments that led up to the recent recession. Please note that these are my own views and should\nnot be attributed to any other person in the Federal Reserve System.\nUndoubtedly, the boom/bust cycle in housing was the critical economic development of the last\ndecade. Robust housing demand led to a boom in new construction, and the share of housing in overall\neconomic activity increased by about 50 percent from 1995 to 2005. Why was demand so strong? Part\nof the answer includes healthy fundamentals, such as strong gains in real income and employment and\nlow long-term interest rates. Also important was a public policy commitment to boost housing activity\nand home ownership, which was reflected in the favorable tax treatment of home ownership and the\nimplicit subsidies to housing generated by government-sponsored enterprises. In addition, innovation\nin mortgage lending and securitization helped to bring home ownership to a wider segment of the\npopulation. This expansion in access to credit has benefitted many Americans, but in retrospect we can\nsee that it was accompanied by lax underwriting standards and overly complex and opaque\nsecuritization. Moreover, a wide array of borrowers, lenders, investors and analysts acted as if housing\nprices were certain to appreciate over both the short and the long run.\nThis boom in construction was accompanied by a dramatic price increase. One popular measure\nof existing home prices increased 192 percent from 1995 to 2006, but by the middle of this decade,\nevidence began to signal that the boom had gone too far. The number of vacant homes rose to new\nrecord highs and many measures of housing activity declined precipitously after recording their peak\nvalues. The number of new housing starts, for example, fell by 79 percent from January 2006 to April\n2009, and prices fell by about a third. Falling home prices have reduced home equity values and\nhousehold wealth. They also have led to rising delinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures, and have\n\n\ftherefore led to substantial reductions in the value of mortgage-backed securities on the books of many\nfinancial institutions.\nIn short, a substantial decline in residential investment began in early 2006. Growth in overall\neconomic activity then slowed before the expansion officially ended in December 2007.\nManufacturing began to fall in mid-2007, with pronounced weakness in building materials and autos.\nIncome growth stagnated, and in 2007, real disposable income grew by only 0.6 percent. Consumer\nspending, not surprisingly, weakened as well, growing by a very modest 1.6 percent in 2007. The year\n2008 began with the economy in a recession that at first seemed to be relatively moderate. Through\nAugust of 2008, for example, payroll employment fell by an average of 137,000 jobs per month. The\nrecession then intensified, and in the last 11 months, employment has fallen by an average of more\nthan a half million jobs per month. I could cite many other dismal statistics, but it is clear that the\ndecline in economic activity intensified last fall and has been large and widespread since then. The\nresult was the worst recession since the 1930s.\nThat’s the background. Currently, the latest data indicate that the economy is leveling out.\nStarting with housing, several indicators of sales and construction activity hit low points in the first\nquarter and have registered modest advances since then. For instance, single-family housing starts have\nrisen by 34 percent since January and new home sales have increased by 17 percent. And there are\nsigns that housing prices are also bottoming out. Even with these welcome gains, however, housing\nactivity remains well below a pace that would accommodate population and income growth on a\nsustained basis. That’s to be expected as we work off the overhang of unsold homes in many parts of\nthe country. But at least housing is no longer a major drag on GDP growth, and that’s a welcome\nimprovement in comparison to the last three years.\nConsumer purchases of cars and trucks also began to tail off in 2007 and then fell very sharply\nin 2008. Sales hit a low point this past February and then increased very gradually before the “Cash for\nClunkers” program gave a jumpstart to sales in July. While that program has undoubtedly pulled\nforward some sales that would otherwise have occurred later in the year, I believe that even without the\nprogram we would have seen some additional firming of auto sales this year. The level of motor\nvehicle sales not only remains well below the pace required to keep up with population and income\ngrowth in the long run, but also appears to be below the rate necessary to maintain the existing stock of\nvehicles. Importantly, as with housing, autos are no longer a drag on GDP growth, a welcome contrast\nto the last two years.\n\n2\n\n\fAside from housing and cars, we also have seen a considerable improvement in the foreign\ntrade picture. The trade deficit was above $60 billion per month for much of last year, but has fallen\nbelow $30 billion for the last five months. While the recession has hit almost all countries\nsimultaneously, the current pickup in growth among some of our major trading partners is likely to\nboost the demand for American exports in coming months, and would provide a welcome lift to\ndomestic producers.\nI’ve identified three areas on the demand side of the economy where we have some grounds for\ncautious optimism, namely housing, autos and exports. We also have seen some promising news on the\nsupply side – namely, in the cyclically sensitive manufacturing sector. There, output fell by 17 percent\nfrom the cyclical peak through June, but rebounded in July by a full percentage point. Much of that\nincrease resulted from the resumption of production by GM and Chrysler, but there is evidence that the\nimprovement in manufacturing is more widespread. The composite index of manufacturing activity\npublished by the Institute for Supply Management has increased substantially this year to a reading just\na smidgeon below the level that would indicate an expanding manufacturing sector. Closer to home,\nour own Richmond Fed Fifth District Index of manufacturing activity in the Fifth District has risen\nsharply this year to a level consistent with solid growth in manufacturing. And just as with the national\nindex, our index of new orders has shown a striking improvement in recent months.\nWe also have seen a significant improvement in financial conditions since the turmoil last fall.\nCorporate borrowing costs have declined considerably, as interest rates on commercial paper and\ncorporate bonds are now much lower than they were last year. Many major banks have sold stock\nsuccessfully and now have the capital to support new lending, even if conditions turn out worse than\nexpected. Although many borrowers face tougher credit terms in a soft economy, the banking system\nas a whole appears capable of supporting business investment and expansion.\nAcademic and industry economists have taken all this into account, and most now see the\nsecond quarter as the low point for GDP in this cycle. The typical forecast calls for positive GDP\ngrowth in the current quarter and a gradual improvement beyond that. I agree with this outlook.\nIndeed, since the beginning of this year I have been expecting positive growth before year-end – but I\nmust emphasize that the recovery is likely to be slow and uneven for some time. We obviously have\nmajor difficulties to overcome before we can feel really good about the economy.\nI won’t be encyclopedic, but the labor market is a prime concern. We lost 247,000 jobs last\nmonth, and until employment is back on a solid growth path, income prospects will be suspect. In\naddition, average wage growth has slowed significantly; last year, average hourly earnings grew 3.9\n3\n\n\fpercent, but so far this year they have only increased at a 1.5 percent annual rate. Thus household\nincomes are facing a double whammy from falling employment and sluggish wage growth, and weak\nincomes will likely put a damper on consumer spending growth. As overall activity regains\nmomentum, the labor market should gradually improve and lead to a better outlook for incomes and\nspending. But right now that’s just a forecast, and we will clearly need to monitor the situation\ncarefully.\nThe outlook would not be complete if I did not mention monetary policy and the outlook for\ninflation. Last year the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate to essentially zero.\nMoreover, the Fed has aggressively expanded its balance sheet; its size has more than doubled in less\nthan a year. The magnitude of these actions is unprecedented in the Fed’s history and should help\nunderpin the nascent recovery.\nRegarding the outlook for inflation, economic forecasters are divided. One school of thought\nexpects inflation to steadily fall for a considerable period in view of the fact that economic slack (as\nindicated by the high unemployment rate, for example) is high and likely to decline only slowly. For\nthe record, the core price index for personal consumption expenditures increased 1.5 percent in the last\n12 months. That’s right on target, as far as I’m concerned, and so a large further decline would be\nunwelcome.\nOther economists, though, point out that the notion that economic slack invariably depresses\ninflation, which is based on a correlation called the “Phillips Curve,” has often led forecasters astray.\nFor example, many forecasters who relied on a Phillips Curve expected a greater decline in core\ninflation than we saw last year. That approach greatly underestimated inflation for much of the 1970s,\nas well as during the rise of inflation in 2003-2005. The situation in late 2003 is especially instructive,\nin my view. Then, we were emerging from a recession and the unemployment rate was stubbornly\nhigh. Yet core inflation did not fall or even remain unchanged; instead, it rose from 1.5 percent in 2003\nto 2.2 percent in 2004 and remained elevated, above 2 percent for several more years. That episode\nillustrates well the pitfalls of overestimating the influence of economic slack on inflation.\nIf economic slack does not drive inflation what does? Some economists stress the importance\nof expectations in determining price setting behavior as an alternative source of inflation. According to\nthis view, if expectations are firmly anchored, then the behavior of individual buyers and sellers will be\nconsistent with the expected outcome and inflation will remain fairly steady. I have a lot of sympathy\nfor this view, because it also matches up well with modern macroeconomics. Unfortunately, we have\nless than ideal measures of the expectations that form the basis of individual behavior. What we do\n4\n\n\fhave suggests that inflation is not likely to decline significantly from here. First, there is evidence from\nmonthly surveys that puts the expected long-term growth in the Consumer Price Index at about 3\npercent, near the center of where it has tracked over the last decade or so, a period in which inflation\nhas averaged over 2 percent. Second, we can get an implicit measure of longer-run inflation\nexpectations from the prices of certain financial security, and those readings imply that inflation is\nexpected to be higher a few years down the road. While neither type of measure is without its flaws,\nboth seem to suggest that inflation is more likely to rise than to fall.\nThis evidence does not illuminate why people might expect inflation to be higher. Market\ncommentary, however, suggests that uncertainty over the likely course of monetary policy might be\nimportant. I mentioned that the Fed’s easing was unprecedented in magnitude. Market participants\nhave at times expressed some doubts that the Fed will be willing and able to reverse course promptly\nenough to keep inflation in check. From a technical point of view, I do not see a problem – we do have\nthe tools to contract our balance sheet and remove monetary stimulus when we need to do so, as\nChairman Bernanke explained in detail in last month’s Monetary Policy Report to Congress. The\nharder problem is choosing when and how rapidly to remove stimulus as the recovery begins. I am\ncertainly aware of the danger of aborting a weak, uneven recovery if we tighten too soon. But there can\nbe a strong temptation to hesitate when emerging from a recession, awaiting conclusive signs of robust\ngrowth. Keeping inflation well-contained may require action before a vigorous recovery has had time\nto establish itself.\nJudging when to withdraw monetary stimulus by raising our policy interest rate is hard enough.\nBut assessing the degree of stimulus provided by our expanded balance sheet poses special challenges.\nThe rapid growth in the Fed’s assets and liabilities occurred during the exceptionally turbulent\nfinancial market conditions of last fall. In response to heightened creditor anxiety, many banks built up\nlarge buffers of highly liquid assets to protect themselves against a possible loss of investor\nconfidence, some of which they held in reserve account balances at the Federal Reserve Banks. The\nincrease in banks’ demand for reserve balances last fall was met in part by the reserves supplied via the\nFed credit programs supporting the commercial paper market and money market mutual funds. The\nrest of the increase was met through banks’ borrowings from the Fed, either through the standard\ndiscount window facility, the Term Auction Facility or by borrowing dollars from foreign central\nbanks. Usage of the commercial paper and money market programs has dropped off since last fall, but\nin the meantime the Federal Open Market Committee instituted a large-scale asset purchase program,\n\n5\n\n\fwhich authorized purchases of up to $300 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, up to $200 billion in\nagency debt, and up to $1.25 trillion in agency mortgage-backed securities.\nIn a statement after the last FOMC meeting, the Committee announced that it would gradually\nslow the pace of Treasury purchases and complete them by the end of October. Purchases of agency\ndebt and agency mortgage-backed securities continue, however, and those purchases supply reserves\nwhich reduce the amount that banks need to borrow from the Fed to satisfy their elevated demand for\nreserve account balances. Should those purchases continue at their current pace, there will come a\npoint at which the banking system will no longer need to borrow to obtain the desired level of reserve\nbalances. At that point further asset purchases would then push the supply of reserve balances beyond\ndemand, and would necessitate a downward adjustment in other yields to induce banks to voluntarily\nhold large balances. This would provide discretely more monetary stimulus than past asset purchases\nhave provided thus far, since arguably such purchases have until now simply displaced bank borrowing\nfrom the Fed. With the economy leveling out and beginning to grow again later this year, and with\nbank reserve demand ebbing as financial conditions improve, I will be evaluating carefully whether we\nneed or want the additional stimulus that purchasing the full amount authorized under our agency\nmortgage-backed securities purchase program would provide.\n\n6\n\n\f",

            "content": "The Role of the Safety Net in the Financial Crisis\nThe Asian Banker Summit 2009\nBeijing, China\nMay 11, 2009\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nIt is a pleasure to join you here for this year’s Asian Banker Summit. We convene at a time of\nrecovery from the financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007. There is a broad consensus\nthat serious shortcomings in the financial system and the way that system is regulated have been\nrevealed. There is little consensus, however, on the nature of those shortcomings. 1\nIn my remarks today, I would like to look back at the origins of the crisis and try to illuminate\nthe fundamental causes of the financial market turmoil of the last two years. This look back is\nwarranted, I believe, because careful diagnosis of the forces that brought us to where we are is\ncritical to designing appropriate long-term responses. Proposals for the reform of financial\nregulations seem to be springing up everywhere these days – like green shoots. But without a\nclear understanding of why the crisis unfolded as it did, we run the risk of repeating the mistakes\nof the past, or, worse yet, adopting reforms that make the system less stable.\nAs the tumultuous events unfolded in financial markets, the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve\nand the other federal banking agencies responded with an array of measures to attempt to limit\nthe damage to the financial system and the broader economy. These measures included lending\nand asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, as well as capital infusions, debt guarantees and\nexpanded deposit insurance from the government. These tools represent an expansion of what we\nin the United States call the “financial safety net” – the array of programs that use government\nand central bank funds to support financial institutions. They have been used aggressively and in\nunprecedented ways to deal with the present crisis and are seen by many to be key components\nin a longer term plan for ensuring financial stability.\nThe use of the financial safety net in the last two years has exceeded any historical precedent in\nthe United States and amounts to a dramatic expansion of the depth and breadth of explicit and\nperceived government protection from financial risk. I have spoken elsewhere of the challenge\nthis expansion presents to us as we seek to design a future financial system with strong private\nsector risk management incentives. Looking back on the crisis thus far, however, I believe that a\nstrong case can be made that the financial safety net, especially those parts that were more\nimplicit and perceived than explicit and written into the laws, played a significant role in the\naccumulation of risks that ultimately led to the turmoil we are still experiencing. While\ndeployment of the financial safety net is often viewed as an essential response to the financial\ncrisis, I believe we need to give serious thought to the extent to which the safety net was actually\na significant cause of the crisis.\n\n1\n\n\fThe argument that the safety net contributed to the financial crisis rests on the effects that\ngovernment guarantees of private debt – either implicit or explicit – can have on debtors’\nincentives to manage risks and creditors’ incentives to appropriately price risk. These effects are\nlikely to have been particularly acute for the large institutions that were at the heart of the crisis\nand were viewed as “too big to fail.” The financial shocks that set off the crisis arose from an\narray of exposures related to off-balance-sheet intermediation of housing finance. When investor\nconfidence in the underlying mortgages deteriorated, those exposures came back onto banks’\nbalance sheets in various forms. These “boomerang assets” strained bank balance sheets, and the\nassociated risk overhang led to increased counterparty risk premia in interbank markets. Most of\nthe fallout from the crisis can be traced back to this problem. Thoughtful financial regulatory\nreform should take this dynamic into account.\nAs always, the views I will express are my own, and do not reflect the views of my colleagues at\nthe Fed. Also, I should note that I will speak primarily from the perspective of the U.S. financial\nsystem, because that is what I know best. But I think the fundamental problems – concerning the\nsources of financial instability and the effects of central bank and government responses – are\nrelevant to any country with a substantial and growing financial sector that may benefit from\nfuture government support.\nOff-Balance Sheet Housing Finance\nThe current financial crisis has been the direct effect of the boom and subsequent bust of home\nbuilding and home prices in the United States over the course of this decade. This story is by\nnow well-known. 2 But for the purposes of our discussion today, I would emphasize the role that\nfinancial innovation played in the expansion of housing credit and thereby the housing boom and\nbust. This process involved the invention and application of new financial arrangements and\ninstruments and the expanded use of existing instruments. Some of this change was at the retail\nlevel – for example, mortgages with high loan-to-value, low documentation, or low borrower\ncredit scores.\nSome of the innovation in housing finance was more wholesale in nature – for example,\nsecuritization of pools of mortgages, collateralized debt obligations consisting of such securities,\nor commercial paper backed by such securities. Securitization transfers credit risk from the banks\nor mortgage companies that originate loans to a broad array of investors. By spreading risk more\nbroadly, the cost of risk-bearing can be reduced, which ultimately benefits borrowers through\nlower interest rates. These arrangements channeled funds to mortgage borrowers without using\nthe general deposit and debt liabilities of banking institutions – that is, they were “off-balancesheet” methods of intermediation. As a result, they benefited from the differing regulatory capital\ntreatment accorded to securitizations, as compared to loans held on a bank’s balance sheet.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it seems apparent that overly optimistic decisions were made at\nmany levels during the expansion of mortgage finance. Ultimately, though, this expansion rested\non the willingness of a broad class of investors to take on exposures to mortgage risks by holding\nsecurities, CDOs or ABCP. So to me, the most central diagnostic question involves the\nincentives of these investors. Were they blind to the risks they were taking on, did they just get a\nbad roll of the dice, or was there something else going on?\n2\n\n\fThe Financial Safety Net\nMany view the large losses experienced by investors and institutions and the resulting financial\nmarket turmoil as evidence of the failure of unregulated financial markets to adequately price\nand allocate risks. Nothing could be further from the truth, for the simple reason that we have not\nbeen operating with unregulated financial markets. Far from it. Financial institutions are highly\nregulated, and they benefit from access to a government-provided financial safety net. So it is\nworth considering whether risk-taking incentives have been distorted by the public’s beliefs\nabout the financial safety net and how such distortion has affected market outcomes.\nSome of the financial safety net is explicit, and some is implicit. The explicit part includes\nfederal deposit insurance and access for banks to the Fed’s discount window lending facilities.\nThe implicit parts are harder to measure, though probably more significant for understanding the\nrisk-taking incentives of financial market participants. These include, most importantly, the\nbroadly held perception that some institutions are “too big to fail” – that is, the failure of such\ninstitutions would be seen by government officials as so disruptive to the financial system that\nintervention is required in order to mitigate the losses born by their creditors. This belief has\nbuilt up over the years in response to a series of events and government actions involving large\nfinancial institutions. 3 While the explicit parts of the safety net historically have been confined\nmostly to banks and other deposit-taking institutions, the very nature of the implicit safety net\nmeans that it is hard to rule out such treatment for large non-bank financial companies.\nThe belief that a financial institution is too big to fail can have profound effects on its incentives.\nSuch an institution will find its debt financing costs to be exceptionally low. Creditors will see\ntheir own risks as at least partially reduced by the explicit or implicit government guarantees, and\nthey will therefore require less of a risk premium and impose fewer covenant restrictions than\nthey otherwise would. Inexpensive debt financing will tend to make an institution seek greater\nleverage than it otherwise would. And increased leverage, in turn, makes an institution less\naverse to taking large risks, other things equal.\nImplicit safety net support is likely to be concentrated among fairly large financial institutions.\nSmall- and medium-sized banks that fail are typically shut down by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation in a manner that provides no support beyond that implied by the explicit\ndeposit insurance program. In contrast, when a large institution faces liquidity problems,\nregulators often step in to provide resources to repay uninsured creditors in order to reduce their\nlosses and thereby reduce the effects on other market participants.\nBoomerang assets\nIt is worth noting that some large firms that appear to have benefited from implicit safety net\nsupport were heavily involved in the securitization of risky mortgages. Many firms had\nsignificant balance sheet holdings of these assets, either through affiliated investment funds or\nthrough the market-making activities of their broker-dealer arms. But much of their involvement\ntook place off the balance sheet. A bank could create a trust to securitize the loans that it\noriginated itself or purchased from other originators. Similar off-balance sheet entities were used\n3\n\n\ffor a wide variety of other financing purposes as well. For example, collateralized debt\nobligations, structured investment vehicles, asset-backed commercial paper conduits are all\nmechanisms that tend to isolate financing from the institution’s own balance sheet.\nIn these off-balance sheet arrangements, banks sometimes stood as providers of back-up\nliquidity, for instance through a line of credit which would help guard against the inability of the\noff-balance sheet entity to roll over maturing short-term obligations. Under some circumstances,\na bank might also be expected to provide support beyond its formal contractual obligations to its\nassociated off-balance sheet entities, motivated by an interest in preserving its own reputation\nand the ability to create and market such entities in the future.\nThe various ways, both explicit and implicit, in which banks stood behind their off-balance sheet\narrangements ultimately meant that the loans and other assets that ostensibly were moved off the\nbalance sheet had the ability to come back onto banks’ balance sheets. You might say that they\nbecame “boomerang assets,” in the sense that they would have been expected to boomerang back\nto the banks when investors turned away from the obligations of off-balance sheet entities. For\nexample, during the summer of 2007, investors retreated from asset-backed commercial paper\nvehicles that they believed were exposed to subprime mortgages. Banks that sponsored or\nprovided lines of credit to such vehicles found themselves having to take the underlying assets\nonto their own books instead. In a similar fashion, investment banks that underwrote or made\nmarkets in such securities saw their holdings grow as the markets soured.\nOne view is that banks’ exposures to off-balance sheet risks unintentionally left them vulnerable\nto a significant and broad-based adverse shock to the credit quality of the underlying loans. An\nalternative view is that, given the incentives created by the financial safety net, this relationship\nwas a rational choice that served the institutions’ interests in maximizing their expected returns.\nA large bank’s access to the safety net is more valuable in states of the world with widespread\nlosses than in generally profitable times. In good times, there is plenty of funding available in\nmarkets for a wide array of credits and assets, while in challenging times, funding becomes\nscarce as investors seek safe-havens and retreat from assets viewed as risky. So it is exactly in\nthe most challenging times that the lower funding costs of institutions with access to the safety\nnet becomes the most useful. Banks’ provision of backstop liquidity services is a way they can\nprofit from their comparative advantage in accessing government funds in times of financial\nmarket stress. Competition between banks with such access is likely to force them to find ways\nto exploit and essentially resell that access.\nI mentioned earlier the differential regulatory treatment under which a bank’s capital requirement\nfor off-balance sheet exposures is lower than for simply holding the underlying loans. There are\ngood reasons for such differential treatment, provided the bank truly bears less risk when the\nloan is off-balance sheet. But the tendency for banks to grow their contingent off-balance sheet\nexposures, and thus increase the risks born by the financial safety net, appears to have been\nexacerbated by the regulatory capital treatment of securitization.\nEnsuring financial stability\n\n4\n\n\fThe lesson I take from all this is that the existence of our financial safety net actually can amplify\nfinancial instability. A discretionary safety net in particular, creates incentives for “too-big-tofail” institutions to pay little attention to and underprice some of the biggest risks we face – risks\nassociated with events like the current turmoil in which large losses are widespread. Their\ntendency to underprice such risk exposures reduces market participants’ incentive to prepare\nagainst and prevent the liquidity disruptions that are financial crises, thus increasing the\nlikelihood of crises.\nWhat steps can we take to safeguard the stability of the financial system? One direction is to seek\nimproved regulation of financial institutions. Certainly there are some steps to be taken down\nthis path. Revisiting the capital treatment of off-balance sheet exposures is one that comes to\nmind (although recent changes in accounting standards may make this unnecessary). Another is\nensuring that all financial companies with explicit access to the safety net have effective\ncompany-wide oversight. This path can be costly, however, and too tight a regulatory grip can\nstifle the financial innovation that, for the most part, has made significant contributions to growth\nin the United States and elsewhere.\nAnother approach involves the actions we can take in the moment of crisis. Here, there has been\nmuch discussion of the need for an improved resolution mechanism that can cope effectively\nwith the failure a large and complex financial firm. This was one of the principles recently laid\nout by the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the secretary of the Treasury. 4 I strongly support\nthis principle, and I believe it would be possible to fashion an appropriate approach by drawing\non existing FDIC authority for banks and existing bankruptcy law for nonbanks. But an\nimportant question in any discussion of failure resolution concerns the use of government or\ncentral bank funding. Any mechanism that allows the resolution authority substantial discretion\nin the use of taxpayer funding to shield creditors from losses would institutionalize the implicit\nsafety net and exacerbate the incentive problems associated with too-big-to-fail. I would prefer a\nmechanism that puts credible constraints on discretionary extensions of the safety net.\nAn expansive and expanding safety net leaves us with two broad choices for addressing our\nfinancial stability problems: put an ever-growing blanket of regulation over financial institutions\nand markets; or set credible limits on the implicit safety net through limiting discretionary\nprotection, coupled with a regulatory regime well calibrated to the extent of the explicit safety\nnet. I prefer the latter.\n1\n\nI am grateful for assistance from John Walter and John Weinberg in preparing this speech.\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "The Economic Outlook, May 2009\nD.C. Chamber of Commerce, 2009 Business Summit\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 8, 2009\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nAs you are well aware, we are in the midst of a severe recession. It is likely that, by at least some\nmetrics, this recession will prove to be more severe than any other we have seen in the last 60\nyears. The recession began at the beginning of last year, and the rate of decline became\nparticularly acute last fall. All economic contractions eventually come to an end, however, and\nthe growth process resumes. Where are we in this process? As I will discuss, while overall\nactivity is still contracting, it now appears as if the pace of contraction is diminishing, and at\nsome point later this year, activity will bottom out and begin expanding again. 1\nBefore getting to the outlook, I would like to provide a little background on some notable\ndevelopments that preceded the recession. As always, the views expressed are my own, and not\nnecessarily the official views of the Federal Reserve System. The most spectacular event was\nundoubtedly the boom-bust cycle in housing activity. Residential investment rose from 4.1\npercent of GDP in 1995 to 6.2 percent of GDP in 2005, which is almost a 50-percent increase in\nhousing’s share in overall economic activity. While the popular view is that the expansion was\nexcessive, a large part of that increase reflected solid economic fundamentals, such as strong\nincome and employment gains and low long-term interest rates. Another important supporting\nfactor was the multifaceted public policy commitment to boosting housing activity and home\nownership, from the favorable tax treatment of mortgage borrowing to the implicit subsidies\nflowing through the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises. In addition, genuine\ninnovation in mortgage lending and securitization helped to make home mortgage borrowing\nmore affordable to a wider segment of the population. In retrospect, we can see that this\nbeneficial financial innovation was accompanied by lax underwriting standards by many lenders,\noverly complex and opaque securitization, and expectations of future housing price appreciation\nby many borrowers, lenders, investors and analysts. In essence, a housing boom that was driven\nby economic fundamentals was intensified by mortgage-market participant assessments that\nwere, in hindsight, overly optimistic.\nSome commentators have claimed that the housing boom and bust and the resulting turmoil\nillustrate fundamental flaws in modern financial markets and institutions. Before we jump to\nsuch conclusions, however, we need to evaluate the extent to which risk-taking incentives in\nfinancial markets have been distorted by actual and perceived government financial safety net\n1\n\n\f2\n\nprotection. It strikes me as quite plausible that the major shortcomings of our system of housing\nfinance are attributable primarily to the distorted behavior of institutions that are viewed as “too\nbig to fail.”\nBy the middle of this decade, evidence began to signal that the boom had gone too far. For\nexample, the number of vacant homes began to rise and, by the end of 2005, the homeowner\nvacancy rate was 2 percent, which at the time was the highest value that had been seen in that\nseries in several decades. At about the same time, many measures of housing activity recorded\ntheir peak values for the cycle. Residential investment has since fallen sharply, from 6.2 percent\nof GDP in 2005 to 2.7 percent last quarter, and it is not clear when a bottom will be reached.\nDespite this decline in new construction activity, home vacancies have continued to increase, and\nthe homeowner vacancy rate has been above 2 ½ percent for the last two-and-a-half years.\nClearly, a substantial overhang of surplus housing inventory remains.\nThe boom in construction was accompanied by increasingly large price increases. One measure\nof home prices increased 192 percent from 1995 to 2006. 2 Similarly, the bust has led to falling\nprices; the same index has fallen 20 percent over the last two years. Falling home prices have\nreduced home equity values and household wealth. Falling home prices also have led to rising\ndelinquencies and defaults and substantial reductions in the value of mortgage-backed securities\non the books of many financial institutions.\nFuture economic historians are likely to identify several other forces that contributed to the onset\nand the intensity of the recession, but are unlikely to revise the assessment the boom-bust cycle\nin housing and housing finance was the dominant causal force. A relatively rapid decline in\nresidential investment began early in 2006. Manufacturing production began to fall in mid-2007,\nwith pronounced weakness in building materials and autos. This weakness on the supply side\nspilled over to total spending, which began declining in the final quarter of 2007 – the official\npeak of the business cycle. After spending began to decline, so did employment; last year we lost\nover 3 million jobs, and in the first quarter of 2009 we lost an additional 2 million jobs. I could\ncontinue, but these dismal statistics should be enough to convey the severity of the current\nrecession. In brief, the declines in economic activity have been large, the declines have been\nwidespread, and the recession already has lasted longer than most post-World War II recessions.\nThat’s the background; now for the outlook. Most prominent forecasters expect the recession to\nend later this year, and I believe that is a reasonable view, for several reasons. I will begin by\nhighlighting two important stabilizing forces that are often underestimated: one is the resilience\nof the American consumer, and the other is the power of monetary policy.\nWith respect to consumers, the key determinant of any family’s spending plan is their current\nincome and wealth, coupled with their view on the incomes they will be receiving in the months\nand years ahead. It is true that consumer wealth has taken a severe beating in this recession. But\nit is also true that for most households, the present value of future labor income is much larger\nthan their tangible and financial asset holdings. Consumers typically cut back on spending in a\nrecession as their wealth declines and their income prospects darken. But at some point,\nconsumers look ahead and become more confident in their post-recession employment and\nincome prospects, and consequently begin to spend more vigorously than an analyst focused on\n\n\f3\n\nrecent wealth trends might expect. This time is no different, and we are now seeing some\nevidence of this type of resilience. I should note that real disposable income has actually\nincreased at a 4.4 percent annual rate in the last two quarters, so firmer spending should not be\ntoo much of a surprise. Thus, in the first quarter, real consumer spending increased at a solid 2.2\npercent annual rate. Since consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of GDP, this\nconsumer resilience is a major supporting factor in macroeconomic forecasts.\nTurning to monetary policy, the Fed has reacted promptly and decisively in the current episode.\nWe lowered our target interest rate, the federal funds rate, from 5 ¼ percent in September 2007\nto the current range of 0 to ¼ percent that was first set in December 2008. This reduction in short\nterm interest rates, which is typical of economic downturns, makes current outlays more\nattractive relative to future outlays for consumers and businesses, and thus helps offset the\ndecline in overall spending. But that’s not all. Over the last eight months, we’ve more than\ndoubled the amount of Federal Reserve monetary liabilities – that is, currency and reserves, a\nquantity often referred to as the monetary base. That’s an extraordinary, unprecedented monetary\nexpansion that will bolster spending in the months ahead.\nA set of improving indicators coming from the housing market provides further reason to believe\nthe recession will end by year-end. Single family housing starts hit a low in January and were\nbasically flat in February and March. New and existing home sales each hit a low point in\nJanuary and are now somewhat higher. One measure of existing home prices has increased, in\nseasonally-adjusted terms, in both January and February. 3 Anecdotal reports of increased buyer\ntraffic and firming prices in some markets are consistent with the recent statistics. Taken all\ntogether, these observations suggest that housing activity may no longer be declining rapidly, as\nit has been for the last three years.\nWe also have some evidence that the worst of the decline in manufacturing is behind us. The\nusual sequence of events in a recession is that demand falters, unwanted inventories build up,\nand manufacturers then make large production cuts, large enough to lower inventories even with\ndemand very soft. That’s where we are now; inventory reduction reduced GDP by 2.8 percent at\nan annual rate last quarter. This inventory runoff sets the stage for any increase in final demand\nto lead to prompt increases in production. That’s what forecasters see for later this year – as\nspending flattens out, production will have to keep pace. We have a smidgen of positive\nevidence of that now, because new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft\nincreased in February and March. I know that sounds pretty esoteric, but it’s actually a widelyfollowed leading indicator of business investment demand for new equipment. In addition,\nsurvey data on manufacturing has also been less gloomy lately. While there are quite a few\nsurveys out there, I’ll highlight our Fifth District Survey, which has historically predicted\nnational data pretty well. Our manufacturing shipments index has increased from minus 56 in\nFebruary to minus 3 in April; similarly, our new orders index has improved from minus 54 to\nminus 2 over the same period. Other recent survey reports are similar, so it seems like the worst\nof the manufacturing declines are behind us, and survey respondents actually have positive\nexpectations for business activity six months ahead.\nThat’s the good news, and to be fair and balanced, I have to add that spending in other categories\nstill is contracting at fairly rapid clip. Nonresidential construction has been declining for several\n\n\f4\n\nmonths now, and significant further declines are expected in the months ahead. Export demand\ncontracted sharply at the end of last year after economic activity in our major trading partners\nbegan slowing down. But the worst news is from the jobs market. We’re losing jobs rapidly. The\nunemployment rate rose from 4.4 percent to 8.5 percent in two years, and the growth of average\nearnings has slowed.\nThe recently enacted fiscal stimulus program is aimed in part at boosting economic growth, but I\nbelieve many popular accounts overstate the effects of fiscal policy actions. Keep in mind that\ntoday’s stimulus will have to be paid for at some point in the future, and the prospect of higher\ntaxes can restrain activity as well. Moreover, some spending diverts workers and firms from\nother uses instead of drawing in unemployed resources. My sense is that the stimulus is likely to\nhave only a marginal effect on the broad contours of the economic recovery.\nAll in all, then, while economic activity still is contracting overall, some spending components\nappear to be bottoming out and the overall rate of contraction thus is slowing. If the emerging\nstability in housing and consumer spending persists, as I expect, some segments of business\ninvestment spending should bottom out by the end of the year and economic growth then would\nturn positive. I expect the labor market to continue to weaken, however, and overall spending is\nlikely to bottom out well before the unemployment rate peaks.\nThe outlook would not be complete, though, without mention of inflation. Last year, I was\nconcerned that inflation was too high; for the 12 months ending in July 2008, the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditure rose 4.5 percent. With the collapse in oil prices, inflation has\nreceded and for the last 12 months, prices have risen only 0.6 percent. Given the extreme\nvolatility of energy prices, it is useful to look at core inflation, which leaves out food and energy\nprices. That measure has increased 1.8 percent in the last 12 months, which is down from 2.4\npercent in August.\nLooking ahead, prognosticators this year have divided into several different camps. Some believe\nthat high unemployment necessarily will lead to continually falling inflation for several years,\nand they are concerned about the risk of outright deflation. I personally have thought the risk of\ndeflation was overstated, and for the first three months of this year, inflation has averaged 2 ¼\npercent – both core prices and overall prices. Another camp places significant weight on the\npublic’s expectations, and as near as we can figure, those are fairly well anchored around 2\npercent. And finally, a third camp sees the rapid growth in our balance sheet, notes the historical\nassociation between rapid money growth and subsequent inflation, and wonders whether\ninflation will accelerate when the economy begins to recover.\nWhere do I stand? While I gravitate to the second camp – the one that views stable expectations\nas likely to anchor inflation in the near term – members of the third camp have identified\ninflation risks that are quite legitimate. The challenge for us on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee will be to shrink our balance sheet and tighten policy soon enough when the recovery\nemerges to prevent rising inflation. The danger is that we will not shrink our balance sheet and\ntighten policy soon enough when the recovery emerges to prevent rising inflation. Choosing the\nright time to withdraw that stimulus will be a challenge, and I believe it will be very important to\navoid the risks of waiting too long or moving too slowly.\n\n\f5\n\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for help in preparing this speech.\nS&P/Case-Shiller 10-City Composite Home Price index.\n3\nFederal Housing Finance Agency monthly House Price Index.\n2\n\n\f",

            "content": "Financial Conditions and the Economic Outlook\nEconomic Outlook Conference\nCharleston Metro Chamber of Commerce\nCharleston, South Carolina\nMarch 26, 2009\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nAfter gradually weakening through most of the first three quarters of 2008, the economy\nhas taken a dramatic turn downward in the last few months. We find ourselves in the\nmidst of a deep recession that is stretching into its second year. This contraction is more\nsevere than we have seen for some time – in fact, you have not lived through an\neconomic contraction this severe as an adult unless you came of age before disco.\nSouth Carolina, with its relatively heavy concentration of manufacturing activity, has felt\nthe full force of this downturn. The state’s unemployment rate has now reached into the\ndouble digits and firms have shed jobs on balance for eight consecutive months. In the\npast year, these job losses have been felt beyond manufacturing, extending across most\nsectors of the economy in South Carolina.\nThis recession has coincided with a period of severe financial stress, as many major\nfinancial institutions in the United States and around the world have taken large losses,\nespecially on assets related to mortgage finance. To many, financial conditions have\nbecome the defining characteristic of this business cycle, and the distressed condition of\nour financial institutions a key factor inhibiting a return to economic growth.\nIn my remarks today, I will argue that financial and economic conditions both stem from\nthe same fundamental sources, and that financial and credit market developments are\nlargely the result, rather than the cause, of the economic slowdown. As always, the views\nI express will be my own, and may not coincide precisely with the views of all of my\nFederal Reserve System colleagues.1\nThe proximate cause of the financial market turbulence, of course, is the home mortgages\nmade from late 2005 through early 2007, near the end of long U.S. housing boom that\nbegan in 1995. Because of the decline in home prices, and thus home equity, since the\npeak in activity in 2005, mortgages made near the peak of the boom, especially the\nsubprime and non-traditional categories, are experiencing much larger losses than\nexpected.\n\n\fThere is a long list of suspects for the cause of the boom in home prices and construction,\nincluding public policy to promote home ownership, financial innovation and low interest\nrates.2 I have emphasized the possibility that risk-taking incentives, in financial markets,\nhave been distorted by actual and perceived government financial safety net protection. I\nalso have emphasized that much future research will be required before economists can\nconfidently gauge the relative contributions of various causal factors.\nWhatever its causes, however, the housing finance boom set the stage for the turmoil that\nhas plagued financial markets since the middle of 2007, when the potential scale of the\nhome mortgage problem became more widely appreciated. The turmoil intensified in\nmid-September of last year, and volatility has been elevated since. This stress has shown\nup in the form of large losses to financial institutions, increased interest spreads for a\nwide array of credit market instruments, and a broad pull-back from the securitization of\nmortgages and other forms of credit.\nThe general sense of caution in financial markets has been the result of three major\ncategories of uncertainty faced by market participants. The first concerns the aggregate\namount of losses on mortgage lending, and some uncertainty still remains on this score,\nsince the ultimate losses will depend importantly on the as yet unknown extent of the\ndecline in home values.\nSecond, financial market participants have faced uncertainty about where the losses will\nturn up since mortgage risks were split up and spread widely, both within the United\nStates and abroad, through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided\nby credit derivative contracts.\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector\nintervention.3 The disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile\norganizations last year may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast\nwhether official support would be forthcoming for any given counterparty. Speculation\nthis year about the structure of possible government rescue programs may also be\ncontributing to financial market uncertainty.\nMost of what has been observed in financial markets since the summer of 2007 is fairly\nintelligible in light of these sources of uncertainty facing market participants.\nApprehension about potential losses caused lenders to demand higher risk premia in\ninterbank credit markets for institutions with at least some presumed mortgage-related\nexposure. Some borrowers were unwilling to pay higher premia for term loans, and\nshortened the tenor of their funding. Others were willing to pay the unusually high\npremia in order to “lock in” funding and protect themselves against an erosion in\ncounterparties’ perception of their creditworthiness. Thus, observing that a particular\ncredit market is “frozen,” “clogged,” or “dried up” may not indicate dysfunction, per se,\nbut may instead indicate just a portfolio reallocation in response to a shift in risk\nassessments.\n\n2\n\n\fWhile the most common reading of these events is that the disruptions to credit channels\nhave pulled the economy into deeper decline, assessing the effects of the financial market\nturmoil on real economic growth is not as straightforward as it might seem. One popular\nnotion is that the credit market disruptions we have seen over the last year or so impede\nthe financial sector’s ability and willingness to extend credit to households and business\nfirms, thereby creating an additional drag on spending. But causation can flow in the\nopposite direction as well. When overall economic activity seems poised to contract, the\noutlook for household income and business revenues deteriorates as well, and borrowers\nbecome less creditworthy, all else constant. Moreover, consumer and business demand\nfor lending declines when they cut back on discretionary outlays. My reading of current\nconditions is that the economy is holding back credit markets much more than credit\nmarkets are holding back the economy.\nThe unprecedented response by the Fed and the government to financial market\ndevelopments is by now a well-known story.4 The alphabet soup of new lending\nprograms and capital injections for large banks, as well as the targeted assistance for\nspecific institutions, have supported market segments at the heart of turmoil. They also\nhave limited the losses born by many market participants. While equity holders in large\nfinancial institutions have seen the value of their shares erode dramatically, government\nand Fed actions have shielded many debt holders from loss. This is the effect of federal\nfinancial safety net protection that I believe raises the greatest concerns about moral\nhazard. Our response has extended well beyond what were perceived in the past to be the\nbounds of such protection, and this raises important questions about how markets will\nexpect us to act in the future.\nAs we emerge from this extraordinary episode and look to restructure our regulatory\nframework, I believe that it is of paramount importance that we also clearly define the\nboundaries of future safety net support. Ambiguity about who is or is not “too big to fail”\ncontributed significantly, in my view, to the incentives of large financial institutions to\npursue strategies focused on leveraged growth and off-balance-sheet risks, which\nultimately added to the instability of markets. Redesigning our financial regulatory\nsystem before establishing clear boundaries around the financial safety net would be like\nputting the cart before the horse.5 I believe we should seek to scale back the boundaries\nof the safety net, because the cost of containing the moral hazard effects of widespread\ngovernment support exceed the benefits of avoiding financial firm failures. But in any\ncase, our choices of whom and how to regulate in the future will need to be\ncommensurate with the status of implicit as well as explicit safety net guarantees.\n\nI have been discussing the effects on credit markets of the decline in residential\nconstruction activity over the last three years. That decline also has had a large impact on\noverall economic activity. At first, it seemed as if the weakness was isolated in the\nhousing market, and GDP expanded at a reasonably satisfactory rate of 2.4 percent in\n2006 and 2.3 percent in 2007. But strains became increasingly evident in 2007.\nManufacturing production peaked in July. Real disposable personal income peaked in\nSeptember of 2007 and consumer spending growth then slowed, dampened as well by the\n\n3\n\n\fdecline in household wealth due to falling house prices. Payroll employment ultimately\npeaked in December of 2007, a date the National Bureau of Economic Research later\nnamed as the transition point between expansion and recession.\nAt first, the recession seemed rather mild, similar to the last two recessions. Payroll\nemployment, for example, fell by 137,000 jobs per month in the first eight months of\n2008. But in September the recession intensified. We’ve lost 3.25 million jobs since then,\nand all other major gauges of economic activity have been dismal since then as well.\nWith jobs, income, and wealth declining, it is no surprise that consumer spending\nweakened further last year, with real expenditure falling 1 ½ percent. As conditions\ndeteriorated for many businesses, capital budgets were slashed. New investment in\nequipment and software fell 11 percent last year in inflation-adjusted terms. And while a\nnumber of large construction projects were under way when the economy turned, new\ncommercial construction activity also began to decline last quarter. Based on such\nindicators as the steep decline in activity at architectural and engineering firms last year,\nwe are likely to see a continuing fall in construction of offices, stores, and other types of\nnonresidential buildings throughout this year.\nAt this point, then, it’s safe to say that this recession will be at least as severe as the\nrecessions of 1973-75 and 1981-82. Despite the abundance of bad news, however,\nprominent forecasters expect the economy to bottom out at some point later this year and\nthen gradually regain forward momentum, and I think that is a reasonable expectation.\nFirst, I believe that we have already received the bulk of the bad news from the housing\nsector. New single-family housing starts have fallen 80 percent over three years, and\nthere is little room for further decline. With new construction activity low, population\ngrowth will gradually absorb the excess supply of housing that exists in many localities.\nSimilarly, auto sales have fallen by more than 40 percent in the recession and are now\nwell below the rate at which cars and trucks wear out or are totaled in accidents. Simple\nreplacement demand will put a floor on auto sales going forward.\nWith this bad news behind us, are there any favorable signs? The answer is yes. First,\neconomic history teaches one to not underestimate the power of monetary stimulus, and\nmonetary policy has been highly stimulative since the recession began. The federal funds\nrate is five percentage points below its peak, and the size of our balance sheet has\ndoubled in the last six months. This stimulative policy stance is likely to begin to show its\neffects on overall activity by year’s end. I also would note that one source of economic\nstress last year was the extraordinary run-up in gasoline and other energy prices in the\nfirst part of the year. That shock has now been reversed, and lower gasoline prices have\ngiven a welcome boost to consumer buying power. Moreover, despite the weak labor\nmarkets, wages have not been slashed and as a result, total wage and salary income has\nheld up remarkably well. In nominal terms there has actually been a slight increase in\nwage income since the recession began, and total personal income – after adjusting for\ntaxes, transfer payments and inflation – has risen almost 3 percent during the recession.\nLast, but certainly not least, one can now point to a couple of positive economic reports.\nTo cite one example, retail sales of goods and services to consumers increased 1.7\n\n4\n\n\fpercent in the first two months of this year. This may be a sign that consumers are\nresponding in the manner suggested by economic theory and basing their immediate\nconsumption plans on less adverse longer-run income prospects. This is a key element in\nthe case for the economy bottoming out this year, because most forecasters expect\nimprovements in consumer spending to lead private demand growth this year, and for\ninvestment spending to turn somewhat later.\nHaving said all that, it bears emphasizing that uncertainty about the economic outlook is\nparticularly acute right now, and that while there are indications consistent with the\nemergence of positive momentum by the end of the year, we are likely to see quite\nnegative economic reports in the meantime.\nYou may have noticed that I have not mentioned so far the recently enacted fiscal\nstimulus program. While there is a fair amount of uncertainty about the effects of such\nefforts to boost economic growth, I believe many popular accounts overstate the effects\nof fiscal policy actions. You may recall that we had fiscal stimulus last year, and the\nevidence indicates that it failed to keep the recession from intensifying. Such\ndisappointing results are actually quite frequent. Keep in mind that today’s stimulus will\nhave to be paid for at some point in the future, and the prospect of higher taxes can\nrestrain activity as well. Moreover, some spending diverts workers and firms from other\nuses instead of drawing in unemployed resources. My sense is that the stimulus is likely\nto have only a marginal effect on the broad contours of the economic recovery.\nYou also may have noticed that I have not yet mentioned inflation. Overall inflation was\nbelow 2 percent earlier in this decade, but began to trend higher back in 2004 and reached\n4.5 percent by the middle of last year, as measured by the 12-month change in the price\nindex for consumer spending. Much of that acceleration reflected energy prices, and with\noil prices down, inflation began to subside last August. For the 12 months ending in\nJanuary, inflation has been a low 0.7 percent.\nLooking ahead, some economists are forecasting that inflation will persist at that low\nlevel for several years, on the grounds that substantial economic slack is generally\nassociated with declining price pressures. I would be cautious about relying on this\ncorrelation as a causal relationship, however, even though it is detectable in many\ndatasets.6 And I am confident that we can prevent outright deflation by expanding our\nexpansive monetary policy stimulus if need be. But at the same time, it is not premature\nto be concerned with the behavior of inflation when the recession is over and the\nrecovery has begun. We have engineered a tremendous expansion in the monetary base\nover the last six months, and the statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee\nlast week announced that further rapid expansion lies ahead. This is an extraordinary\npolicy response, and I believe it is appropriate. But such a large increase in the monetary\nbase cannot be left in place indefinitely without creating quite sizeable inflation\npressures. Choosing the right time to withdraw that stimulus will be a challenge, and I\nbelieve it will be very important to avoid the risk of waiting too long.\n\n5\n\n\fThe monetary liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks have more than doubled over the\nlast several months, from around $940 billion the week ending September 10, to around\n$1.7 trillion the week ending March 18. Virtually all of this increase was in the form of\nbank reserves – the deposit balances that banks hold at their Federal Reserve Banks –\nwhich went from $8 billion to around $780 billion over that period. (The rest of the\nmonetary base consists of paper currency.) This increase in the Fed’s money supply was\na direct consequence of the collection of credit programs initiated last fall. Prior to\nOctober, the Fed was able to “sterilize” new lending through offsetting asset sales that\nsoaked up the additional bank reserves, which otherwise would have increased the\nmonetary base. After October, the cumulative amount lent became too large to sterilize,\nand further lending added to the monetary base. Luckily, the implementation of these\nlarge credit programs coincided with a time in which additional monetary stimulus was\nwarranted.\nBut monetary policy and credit programs do two different things. Monetary policy\nstabilizes the purchasing power of money over time by keeping the price level stable and\nrelatively predictable, and by doing so, contributes to maximum sustainable economic\ngrowth. Credit policy is also aimed at promoting growth, but it is more a form of fiscal\npolicy in that it uses the public sector’s balance sheet to alter the allocation of resources.\nIn this instance, credit market interventions have been financed to a large degree by the\nissue of new monetary liabilities, but they could just as well be financed with nonmonetary liabilities, such as U.S. Treasury securities.\nThe debate about whether the economy is more in need of credit policy or traditional\nmonetary policy actions at this time is based on competing understandings of the\nrelationship between credit markets and aggregate economic performance. There’s no\ndebate that the dire economic conditions we now face warrant a strong policy response.\nBut the best type of response – credit versus money – depends on which of these\ncompeting theories is a better understanding of how our economy works. While this\ncould complicate policy choices as a general matter, the good news right now is that the\ncredit and monetary views yield complementary policy implications, because policies\nthat provide targeted Fed credit also add reserves to the monetary base. The more\ndifficult choices will come down the road, if improvements in credit market conditions\nand the overall economy do not coincide.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg and Roy Webb for assistance in preparing this address.\nJanuary speech in Columbia\n3\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "Government Lending and Monetary Policy\nNational Association for Business Economics\n2009 Washington Economic Policy Conference\nAlexandria, Virginia\nMarch 2, 2009\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThe U.S. economy is now in the second year of a recession that began at the end of\n2007. 1 The deterioration in economic activity has been particularly sharp since\nSeptember of last year. But throughout this downturn, a singular feature has been the\nextent of the disruption to financial markets and losses suffered by financial institutions.\nThe financial dimension of this contraction has brought an historic expansion in\ngovernment lending to financial market participants, mostly through an expanding array\nof Federal Reserve initiatives. In contrast, the Fed's response to most recessions in recent\ndecades has been limited to adjustments of the target federal funds rate. We've done that\nin this cycle, too, bringing the funds rate target from 5 ¼ percent in September of 2007 to\nbetween zero and 25 basis points now.\nThese two dimensions of the Fed's response are interconnected, since both involve the\nuse of our balance sheet, but they have different impacts on the economy. So today, I'd\nlike to speak about the economic effects of government lending and how that relates to\nour broader monetary policy goals. In doing so, I'll note what I see as important\ndifferences between monetary and credit policy and I’ll offer my thoughts on the Fed's\nrole in the extension of government credit. And I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear\nthat these are my own views and not necessarily those of any of my colleagues on the\nFOMC.\nThe Recent Slowdown\nViews about the role of government credit in promoting financial and macroeconomic\nstability tend to be shaped by views about the role of credit in the business cycle. In one\npopular view, credit market disturbances, such as the recent rise in losses on mortgagebacked securities, cause banks and other credit intermediaries to pull back credit supply\nas they attempt to repair their balance sheets. The reduction in lending to households and\nfirms forces them to reduce their spending on goods and services and creates an\nadditional drag on growth. An alternative view is that shocks to the economy affect\nspending more directly, and that as growth declines, the creditworthiness of households\nand firms deteriorates, causing credit flows to fall and spreads to widen.\nThese two views represent opposite directions of causality between credit and aggregate\nspending. In reality, both of these directions may well be in operation at the same time,\nand determining the quantitative importance of each is very hard. But my reading of\n1\n\n\frecent events emphasizes the second view, in which the effect of slowing growth on\ncredit conditions predominates. This view has received much less attention than it\ndeserves, I believe, so let me say a few words about the current cycle in light of this\nissue.\nThe antecedent of the contraction we are in was the boom in home sales, prices and\nconstruction coming out of the last recession. Untangling the causes of that boom poses\nresearch challenges that will launch a thousand dissertations, I expect. The most plausible\nsuspects at this point include financial innovation, regulatory laxity, accommodative\nmonetary policy and a global savings glut; but all worked through the expanding\navailability of mortgage credit. Even with favorable financing conditions though, the\nincreasingly leveraged purchases of homes would not have made sense without\nconfidence – in hindsight misplaced confidence – in a continued upward path for home\nprices.\nWhatever the causes of the boom, the result was what turned out to be a glut of housing,\nwhich, as people’s beliefs about demand growth adjusted, led to historic declines in\nprices. The most immediate effect was a collapse in residential investment, and large\nconsequent declines in employment in construction and related sectors. The reduction in\nhome owners’ wealth as home prices declined, together with growing uncertainty about\nlabor market prospects, caused household spending to slow beginning in mid-2007, and\nthen decline outright in mid-2008. The dimming outlook for consumer spending also\ndampened business investment spending in turn, and spread the employment slowdown\nbeyond the residential construction sector. This, in turn, further dampened consumer\nspending.\nThese trends reduced prospects for and increased uncertainty about household incomes\nand firm revenues. As a result, households and firms are riskier lending prospects than\nthey were a couple of years ago, given the change in the overall macroeconomic\nenvironment. Note that surveys that ask lenders whether they have “tightened terms” in\nrecent months do not really get at this question. Any given profile of borrower\ncharacteristics – income, balance sheet and credit score, for example – is likely to\ntranslate into a riskier loan now, so banks are likely to have tightened qualification cutoffs even without any reduction in their risk appetite. 2\nThe downturn in home prices in many regions has resulted in increased losses on home\nmortgages, particularly subprime mortgages. Uncertainty about the ultimate depth of the\ndecline in home values has meant ongoing uncertainty about the magnitude of aggregate\nlosses that will be realized on mortgage-related assets. Financial market participants have\nalso faced uncertainty about where these losses will turn up. Mortgage risks were split up\nand spread widely, both within the United States and abroad, through securitization and\nuse of the insurance capabilities provided by credit derivative contracts, making it\ndifficult to assess any individual institution’s share of the aggregate exposure. In addition,\nfinancial market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public\nsector intervention. The disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile\norganizations may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast whether\n2\n\n\fofficial support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty, and where in the capital\nstructure that support would land.\nMost of what has been observed in financial markets since the summer of 2007 seems\nreadily intelligible as a consequence of the increased uncertainty facing market\nparticipants resulting from the significant economic downturn. Apprehension about\npotential losses caused lenders to demand higher risk premia in interbank credit markets\nfor institutions with at least some presumed mortgage-related exposure. Market\nparticipants became especially concerned about the heightened risk associated with\nlending at longer maturities, and so risk premia became especially elevated for term\nlending. Some borrowers were unwilling to pay higher premia for term loans, and\nshortened the tenor of their funding. Others sought to protect themselves against an\nerosion in counterparties’ perception of their creditworthiness by paying the unusually\nhigh premia in order to “lock in” funding or by hoarding liquid assets despite high\nopportunity costs. More broadly, the proliferation of intermediation channels in recent\nyears has meant that for many borrowers, the next best financing option may not be much\nmore costly. For example, many commercial paper issuers have back-up lines of credit\nwith banks that they can draw on in the event they are unsatisfied with market pricing.\nThus observing that a given intermediation channel is “frozen,” “clogged,” or “dried up”\nmay not indicate dysfunction, per se, but may indicate instead just a portfolio reallocation\nin response to a shift in risk assessments.\nFederal Reserve Lending\nIn response to the credit market turmoil, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the FDIC\nhave undertaken a sequence of interventions. Some of these have been fairly direct\nextensions of the Fed’s standard discount window lending – such the Term Auction\nFacility, or even the primary dealer credit facility, which extended credit to a specific set\nof non-bank financial institutions. Others involve the use of Fed credit to support specific\nclasses of assets – for instance, commercial paper and now asset backed securities. 3 Still\nothers, of course, have provided direct assistance to specific institutions, such as Bear\nStearns and AIG. Citibank and Bank of America obtained asset guarantees provided\njointly by the Fed, the FDIC and the Treasury.\nEach of these credit programs involves Federal Reserve lending or lending commitments.\nBefore last October, the Fed was able to “sterilize” new lending through offsetting asset\nsales that soaked up the additional bank reserves, which otherwise would have increased\nthe monetary base and pushed the federal funds rate below its target at the time. After\nOctober, the cumulative amount lent became too large to sterilize, and further lending\nadded to the monetary base. Luckily, and perhaps not coincidentally, the implementation\nof these large credit programs has coincided with a time in which additional monetary\nstimulus is warranted.\nEven though the conventional measure of the stance of monetary policy is the central\nbank’s interest rate target, monetary policy fundamentally is always about the amount of\nmonetary liabilities issued by the central bank – also known as the “monetary base.”\n3\n\n\fAfter all, hitting an interest rate target requires varying the quantity of central bank\nmoney, reducing the supply to raise rates and increasing the supply to reduce rates. Even\nwhen the policy rate has been driven down to zero, central banks can still dictate the\nsupply of central bank money. And changes in the monetary base can still provide\neconomic stimulus. Even if the funds rate does not change in response to an increase in\nthe monetary base, some other rates of return must change to induce banks to voluntarily\nhold the additional supply of bank reserves.\nThese government lending programs, by targeting particular market sectors, alter the\nallocation of credit across markets. Consequently, while some market segments benefit\nfrom reduced funding costs, others may actually see their costs rise as credit is diverted to\nthose markets that have been targeted for support. An alternative approach to expanding\nthe monetary base is to do it in a way that is more neutral across market segments. Since\nrisky financial assets are presumably priced in relation to U.S. Treasury securities, which\nare free of credit risk, purchasing Treasuries is likely to have little effect on the relative\ncredit spreads on different financial instruments. This is one reason I expressed my\npreference, in my dissent at the last FOMC meeting, for managing the monetary base by\npurchasing U.S. Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programs.\nMoral Hazard\nAnother reason for that preference is that targeted credit programs, in addition to their\nimmediate effect on the allocation of credit and resources across market segments,\ncontribute to the moral hazard problem inherent in the provision of government-funded\ncredit or guarantees. Safety net support for financial institutions encourages private\nmarket participants to view some institutions as “too big to fail,” and weakens those\ninstitutions’ incentive to monitor and manage the risks they face in their business\nstrategies and financial market transactions. 4 Intervention to support particular asset\nclasses similarly weakens incentives by encouraging private market participants to\ndiscount the cost of credit losses that would depress asset prices. And this weakening of\nincentives, by inducing greater risk-taking, eventually increases the ultimate cost of\nproviding safety net protection.\nSome have questioned the empirical relevance of moral hazard in the current episode of\nfinancial market turmoil, citing the fact the equity holders in institutions receiving\ngovernment support have suffered significant – and in a few cases, total – losses. But this\nobservation misses an important point about the moral hazard effects of government\nlending. The most direct effect of government credit or guarantees is to lower the cost of\nprivate credit to protected borrowers. Limiting the circumstances in which the benefiting\ninstitution will have insufficient liquidity to survive, means that private debt holders bear\nless risk and have less incentive to constrain risk-taking by the borrower. Absent\nregulatory constraints, this encourages those institutions to take on more risks than they\notherwise would, including by becoming more highly leveraged. The more leveraged a\nfirm, the greater the incentive of management and equity to take on risk. Indeed, limited\nliability means that equity holders could find a negative net present value investment to\nbe worthwhile, if it is risky enough. So the fact that equity has absorbed large losses is\n4\n\n\fnot strong evidence against moral hazard effects if the safety net protects – and reduces\nthe cost of – debt. Indeed, the risk-shifting effect of moral hazard makes large losses to\nequity more likely to occur, because it makes large gambles more attractive.\nIt is also commonly argued that moral hazard, while a real and undesirable consequence\nof the safety net, is an unavoidable cost of the need to respond forcefully to prevent the\ndisorderly failure of a large complex institution. This view seems to be based on the\nassumption that the systemic risks posed by large financial institutions – stemming from\nconcentrated and correlated exposures among a complex web of counterparties – are an\ninherent and unavoidable trait of modern financial markets. But the pervasiveness of such\ncharacteristics can itself be an endogenous consequence of moral hazard. If systemic\nrisks at large financial institutions are particularly protected by the safety net of\ngovernment credit, then such institutions will have an extra incentive to acquire precisely\nthose risks. This may be why the unexpectedly large exposures of large banking\norganizations to home-mortgage-related risks stemmed from their provision of backstop\nliquidity commitments to a wide array of off-balance-sheet securitization arrangements.\nInstitutions that are viewed as too big to fail may have had a comparative advantage in\nsupplying contingent liquidity that was most likely to be needed in the event of dire\nmacroeconomic shocks because those are the circumstances most likely to elicit broadscale government lending support.\nCart Before the Horse\nThe regulatory and supervisory regime surrounding institutions that benefit from access\nto government lending support plays a critical role in constraining and preventing the\nexcessive risk-taking that would otherwise be induced by the moral hazard effects of that\nsupport. The dramatic recent expansion in government lending has extended safety net\nsupport beyond the set of institutions previously covered by that regime. If no corrective\naction is taken, the next economic expansion would likely see more excessive risk-taking\nthat could again destabilize the financial system. It is critical that the scope of regulatory\nand supervisory oversight should match the extent of access to government credit support\nin order to contain moral hazard effectively. For that match to take place, the boundaries\nof government credit support need to be well-defined. In my view, it would be preferable\nfor those boundaries to be rolled back.\nThe Federal Reserve System has been digesting and analyzing the lessons learned from\nthe recent episode and is exploring steps to strengthen supervisory practices and\nprocesses accordingly. More broadly, many observers have urged a restructuring or\nreengineering of our approach to financial regulation. 5 No doubt much will be said about\nfinancial regulatory reform in the weeks ahead, and a discussion of the relevant issues\nwould be beyond my scope here. I will just offer the observation that restoring\ncompatibility between the scope of government support and the scope of government\nsupervision seems essential to a healthy and sustainable financial system. That vantage\npoint suggests that when we do get around to considering concrete proposals for our\nfinancial regulatory structure, our choices about whom to regulate and how to regulate\nthem ought to be driven by our decisions about who is eligible for public sector credit and\n5\n\n\funder what conditions. In 1983, John Kareken of the University of Minnesota and the\nMinneapolis Fed described financial deregulation as “putting the cart before the horse,”\nsuggesting that expanding the powers of banking and thrift institutions without\nappropriate attention to design of the financial safety net could be a risky move. 6 His\nanalysis was prescient, given the savings and loan debacle that followed later in that\ndecade. Karaken’s emphasis was on deregulation in the presence of deposit insurance, but\nin the current episode, lending by the Fed and the Treasury has become just as important\na part of the federal financial safety net. Nobody is talking about deregulation now, but\nthe same principle applies: namely, redesigning our financial regulatory system before\nestablishing the boundaries of the financial safety net would be like putting the cart\nbefore the horse.\nMonetary Policy and Credit Policy\nI have spent some time discussing government lending, but the title of my talk is\n“Government Lending and Monetary Policy,” so I would like to say a few words now\nabout the relationship between the two. Earlier, I described how the dramatic expansion\nin Federal Reserve Bank lending in the last few months has caused a dramatic increase in\nthe size of our collective balance sheet and the monetary base. 7 I noted that this is a time\nin which additional monetary stimulus is needed, and so the two strategies are not in\nconflict.\nNevertheless, monetary policy and credit policy are two different things. Monetary policy\nconsists of changes in the monetary base – the sum of outstanding currency and bank\nreserves. Credit policy, in contrast, changes the Fed’s assets while holding the amount of\nthe monetary base fixed – sterilized lending is an example. Monetary policy aims at\nkeeping the price level stable and relatively predictable, and by doing so, contribute to\nmaximum sustainable economic growth. Credit policy is also aimed at promoting growth,\nbut it is a form of fiscal policy in that it uses the public sector’s balance sheet to alter the\nallocation of resources.\nAs I said, Federal Reserve lending has been financed to a large degree recently by\nincreases in the monetary base, but that lending could just as well be performed by the\nU.S. Treasury and financed by the issue of Treasury securities. 8 No immediate change in\nthe assets and liabilities of the public would be required, since the additional amount of\ndebt the Treasury issued would exactly match the additional need for assets by the\nFederal Reserve Banks if the monetary base were to remain unchanged.\nThere is one significant difference between lending performed by the U.S. Treasury and\nlending performed by the Federal Reserve Banks, however. The Treasury can lend only\nunder explicit authorization from Congress. The Federal Reserve, in contrast, has\nindependent control of its balance sheet and funds itself outside of the normal\nappropriations process. That independence was affirmed in the 1951 Fed-Treasury\nAccord, which freed the Fed from an obligation to suppress interest rates for the purpose\nof limiting the cost of public debt. 9 Central bank independence is now widely recognized\nas an important mechanism for insulating monetary policymaking from inflationary\n6\n\n\fpolitical pressures, and allowing it to respond quickly to short-run macroeconomic\ndevelopments.\nA New Accord?\nThis observation led my former colleague, Marvin Goodfriend, to argue 15 years ago for\ntransferring much of the Fed’s lending activities to the Treasury. He wrote:\n“Congress bestows such independence only because it is necessary for the central\nbank to do its job effectively. Hence, the presumption ought to be that the Fed\nshould perform only those functions that must be carried out by an independent\ncentral bank.” 10\nWhile both the Fed and the Treasury can extend credit, only the Fed issues money. Thus,\nthe Fed’s primary focus should be the management of its monetary liabilities.\nGoodfriend advocated an understanding or agreement between Fed and Treasury on\ncredit policy, analogous to the 1951 Accord. 11 A new “credit accord” that assigns to the\nTreasury the responsibility for all but very short-term lending to solvent institutions\nwould have a number of advantages, I believe. On a practical level, at some point in the\nfuture, the Fed will need to withdraw monetary stimulus to prevent a resurgence of\ninflation when the economy begins to recover. That time could arrive before credit\nmarkets are deemed to be fully enough “healed” to warrant winding down particular\ncredit programs. If monetary policy and credit programs remain tied together, as they\ncurrently are, we risk having to terminate credit programs abruptly, or else compromise\non our inflation objective. Separating credit programs from monetary policy would make\nit easier to devise a successful “exit strategy,” and would reduce market uncertainty about\nhow any potential tension between monetary and credit policy will be resolved.\nGovernment lending, whether by the Fed or by the Treasury, fundamentally represents\nfiscal policy in the sense that it channels taxpayer funds to private sector entities. The\npresumption ought to be that such lending is subject to the checks and balances of the\nappropriations process laid out in the Constitution. Using the Fed’s balance sheet is at\ntimes the path of least resistance, because it allows government lending to circumvent the\nCongressional approval process. This risks entangling the Fed in attempts to influence\ncredit allocation, thereby exposing monetary policy to political pressures.\nGranted, there are circumstances in which timeliness precludes explicit Congressional\nauthorization. But the understanding could stipulate that the emergency lending is\ntransferred to the books of the Treasury after a brief period of time has elapsed.\nMoreover, the Treasury could be given explicit line of credit authority, as they now have\nfor Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other entities. For longer-term credit programs that are\nmeant to support specific market segments, and which are designed and implemented\nover a period of weeks, there would not seem to be any practical impediment to seeking\nexplicit Congressional authorization.\n\n7\n\n\fI spoke earlier of my sense that the scope of the financial safety net will need to be scaled\nback. This could be difficult. When a financial crisis threatens one or more institutions\nthat appear to pose “systemic” risks to a broad array of counterparties, it can be hard to\ncontemplate not intervening. But it may also be the case that the systemic risks are partly\nthe result of expectations about the likelihood of government intervention. This is a\nclassic example of a so-called time consistency problem. 12 One would like market\nparticipants to believe you are committed to resist lending, though following through\nlater will be difficult. A credit accord could help limit the financial safety net by placing a\nhurdle in the way of intervention beyond a well-defined set of circumstances.\nTransferring authority for most government lending to the U.S. Treasury and subjecting\nthat authority to a legislated framework can help commit authorities to a bounded\ngovernment safety net.\nConclusion\nRaising questions about the efficacy of government lending, as I have done, does not\nimply a view that financial markets are working perfectly. Indeed, financial markets are\nundergoing tremendous strains as they adjust to large and hard-to-predict losses. I think\nthe fundamental problem with our financial system involves how our large institutions\naccumulated such large, concentrated exposures. Regulatory shortcomings seemed to\ncontribute, and much needed attention will be given to this problem in the coming\nmonths. But part of the story of how and why institutions exposed themselves to the\nlosses they are now experiencing has to do with the incentive effects of the financial\nsafety net. And I hope that this problem also gets the attention it deserves.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg for help in preparing this speech.\nFor a model in which it is optimal for credit standards vary over the business cycle, see John Weinberg,\n“Cycles in Lending Standards?”, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, Summer 1995,\nvol. 81, no. 3, pp. 1-18.\n3\nFor details on the Fed’s credit market interventions see www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst.htm.\n4\nSee Gary H.

            "content": "Financial Conditions and the Economic Outlook\nRisk Management Association, Richmond Chapter\nRichmond, Va.\nJanuary 16, 2009\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nThe beginning of a new calendar year is a popular occasion for discussing the outlook for\nfuture economic conditions. Recent trends to some extent have dampened enthusiasm for\nthis annual exercise. On the other hand, uncertainty about the economic outlook looms\nparticularly large now, and the economic policy challenges we face are particularly\nprofound, so perhaps the returns to such a discussion are above average this year, even if\nour zeal for the topic is a bit below average.\nThe basis for dampened enthusiasm regarding this year’s economic outlook is fairly\nclear. The U.S. economy has been in a recession for a year now, and the pace of the\ncontraction in economic activity appeared to increase markedly around the end of\nSeptember. In my remarks today, I will discuss the factors I see affecting the outlook for\nthe U.S. economy and monetary policy. As always, the views I express will be my own,\nand may not coincide exactly with the views of all of my Federal Reserve System\ncolleagues. 1 I will devote special attention to recent financial market conditions, because\nthe financial market turbulence that has been so striking over the last year-and-a-half\nlooms large in any discussion of the economy and economic policy these days.\nThe proximate cause of the financial market turbulence, of course, is the home mortgages\nmade from late 2005 through early 2007, near the end of long U.S. housing boom that\nbegan in 1995. Since the peak in activity in 2005, housing investment has fallen by more\nthan 40 percent. Average housing prices, as measured by the FHFA repeat sales index,\nhave fallen nearly 9 percent since their peak in April 2007. The resulting erosion in home\nequity for many borrowers has meant that mortgages made near the peak of the boom,\nespecially the subprime and non-traditional categories, are experiencing much larger\nlosses than expected.\nIt will take years of research to untangle the quantitative contribution of various causal\nfactors to the decade-long housing boom, the accompanying rise in subprime mortgage\nlending, and the subsequent increase in mortgage losses. A definitive assessment is too\nmuch to ask at this point, but a list of the most plausible suspects can easily be discerned.\nOne candidate that is often overlooked is the significant increase in productivity growth,\nand thus growth in real household income, which began around 1995 and lasted until\nsome time earlier in this decade. To the extent that households came to see the increase in\ntrend real income growth as likely to continue, one would expect to see a sustained rise in\nthe demand for housing. Moreover, current data suggest a decline in trend productivity\n\n\fgrowth in the middle of this decade, around the time housing demand peaked and began\nfalling.\nAnother plausible contributing factor was the wave of technological innovation in retail\ncredit delivery, which allowed lenders to make finer distinctions between potential\nborrowers. This facilitated lower interest rates for some borrowers and an expansion of\nlending to borrowers formerly viewed as unqualified for credit. As in any industry\nundergoing an innovation-driven structural shift (the telecommunications industry in the\nlate 1990s, for example), the natural evolution of the industry can involve overshooting\nand retrenchment. Subprime lending with high loan-to-value ratios was profitable while\nhome prices were rapidly rising, but profitability fell sharply when price trends reversed.\nHome price trends are hard to predict with any confidence, and lenders who found past\nsubprime mortgage lending profitable in 2004, 2005 and 2006 may have underestimated\nthe probability of a broad and sustained decline in home prices.\nThe regulatory and supervisory regime surrounding U.S. housing finance also seems\nlikely to have contributed to the boom in housing and housing finance. Here, several\nfactors deserve mention. Supervisory agencies, like borrowers, lenders and investors,\nassigned a low probability to the possibility of an adverse housing demand shift of the\nmagnitude and geographic extent that we have seen. In addition, private sector incentives\nto foresee and protect against such shocks were to some extent dampened by the presence\nof the federal financial safety net – that is, deposit insurance and the access of\ncommercial banking organizations to Federal Reserve lending. Market participants may\nhave inferred that a housing market shock that was large enough to afflict a broad swath\nof the financial system would elicit significant official support, particularly for\ninstitutions perceived as “too big to fail.” 2 Past instances of government intervention to\nprevent large financial institutions from failing – from Continental Illinois to Long Term\nCapital Management – have encouraged such inferences. The federal safety net probably\nalso played a role in banks’ involvement in the securitization process at the heart of\nhousing finance, particularly among institutions perceived as too big to fail. The use of\noff-balance sheet arrangements and the provision of back-up lines of credit created\ncontingent exposures for the banking system that by design were most likely to be\nrealized in generally bad states of the world, when the safety-net protection of the formal\nbanking sector would be most valuable. In addition to these incentive problems, the\ninferred prospect of support for the government-sponsored housing finance enterprises,\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, lowered their borrowing costs and contributed to their\ndemand for mortgage-backed securities. Legislative incentives for such enterprises to\nextend credit to low-income borrowers also would have stimulated their demand for\nsecurities backed by subprime and nontraditional mortgages.\nAnother key causal suspect is the relatively low path of interest rates after the recession\nearlier this decade, especially in 2003 and 2004. Some economists have argued, with the\nbenefit of hindsight, that tighter monetary policy during that period would have led to\nbetter outcomes by preventing core inflation from rising, thus limiting the housing boom\nand mitigating the subsequent bust. 3 This view strikes me as quite plausible, but again,\nfurther research will be required to substantiate this hypothesis.\n\n2\n\n\fThat’s all prologue, however, to the turmoil that has plagued financial markets since the\nmiddle of last year, when the potential scale of the home mortgage problem became more\nwidely appreciated. The turmoil intensified in mid-September, and volatility has been\nelevated since. Financial market participants have faced three major categories of\nuncertainty. The first concerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending. For\nmortgages made in 2006 and early 2007 – the vintages in which losses are concentrated –\nsignificant uncertainty still remains regarding total losses.\nSecond, financial market participants have faced uncertainty about where the losses will\nturn up. Mortgage risks were split up and spread widely, both within the United States\nand abroad, through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided by credit\nderivative contracts. As a result, financial market participants are understandably\napprehensive about whether a particular counterparty’s mortgage-related losses will\nerode their capital buffer enough to threaten their viability.\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector\nintervention. 4 The disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile\norganizations may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast whether\nofficial support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty. Shifts in expectations\nregarding official intervention may have added volatility to financial asset markets that\nalready were roiled by an increasingly uncertain growth outlook. And uncertainty about\nthe form of government support – asset purchases versus dilutive capital purchases, for\nexample – may have hindered the provision of fresh equity capital.\nMost of what has been observed in financial market since the summer of 2007 is fairly\nintelligible in light of these sources of uncertainty facing market participants.\nApprehension about potential losses caused lenders to demand higher risk premia in\ninterbank credit markets for institutions with at least some presumed mortgage-related\nexposure. Market participants became especially concerned about the heightened risk\nassociated with lending at longer maturities, and so risk premia became especially\nelevated for term lending. Some borrowers were unwilling to pay higher premia for term\nloans, and shortened the tenor of their funding. Others were willing to pay the unusually\nhigh premia in order to “lock in” funding and protect themselves against an erosion in\ncounterparties’ perception of their creditworthiness. More broadly, the proliferation of\nintermediation channels in recent years has meant that for many borrowers, the next best\nfinancing option may not be much more costly. For example, many commercial paper\nissuers have back-up lines of credit with banks that they can draw on in the event they are\nunsatisfied with market pricing. Thus observing that a given intermediation channel is\n“frozen,” “clogged,” or “dried up” may not indicate dysfunction, per se, but may indicate\ninstead just a portfolio reallocation in response to a shift in risk assessments.\nThe striking feature of central bank lending and other government financial support\nduring the recent turmoil is the extent to which it has extended well beyond the\nboundaries that previously were understood to constrain such lending, both in the range\nof institutions and the contractual terms on which credit has been provided. Intervention\n\n3\n\n\fhas been driven by a desire to prevent damaging disruptions to financial markets, and\nthus reduce the overall costs of the turmoil. While this objective is clearly\nunderstandable, central bank lending can create the expectation that similar support will\nbe forthcoming when market disruptions occur in the future. Such expectations can\nthemselves be very costly, because they can distort the incentives faced by, and as a\nresult, the choices made by private-sector participants. For example, in the past year,\nexpectation of official support may have induced some firms to take the risk of turning\ndown capital infusions or merger offers in hopes of finding better terms in the future.\nProspective equity investors may have demanded stiffer terms to compensate for the\npossibility of dilutive government intervention. Clearly, these recent examples of the\nmoral hazard effects of official intervention are detrimental to broader public policy\nobjectives, and place a significant burden on the supervisors of financial institutions to\nconstrain such risk-taking.\nThe critical policy question of our time is where to establish the boundaries around the\npublic-sector safety net provided to financial market participants, now that the old\nboundaries are gone. In doing so, the prime directive should be that the extent of\nregulatory and supervisory oversight should match the extent of access to central bank\ncredit in order to contain moral hazard effectively. The dramatic recent expansion in\nFederal Reserve lending, and government support more broadly, has extended public\nsector support beyond existing supervisory reach, and thus could destabilize the financial\nsystem, if no corrective action is taken. Restoring consistency between the scope of\ngovernment support and the scope of government supervision is essential to a healthy and\nsustainable financial system. One option is simply to adapt our regulatory and\nsupervisory regime to the new wider implied reach of government lending support. This\nstrikes me as an unattractive option, if for no other reason than the current uncertainty\nabout the outer bounds of that support. Constraining moral hazard in such a regime would\nbe an immense and daunting task. I take it as given, therefore, that the scope of financial\nsafety net ultimately must be rolled back.\nNote that it will not be sufficient simply to roll back the current lending programs when\nthe economy begins recovering. The precedents that have been set during this episode\nwill influence how market participants expect policymakers to react during the next\nepisode of financial market turmoil. Establishing a coherent and stable financial\nregulatory regime will require rolling back expectations about how the policymakers will\nrespond to the next financial market disturbance or the next recession. Doing so will be\ndifficult. But rolling back those expectations will be impossible if moral hazard concerns\nare always set aside in the exigencies of a crisis. 5\nAssessing the effects of the financial market turmoil on real economic growth is not as\nstraightforward as it might seem. One popular notion is that the credit market disruptions\nwe’ve seen over the last year or so impede the financial sector’s ability and willingness to\nextend credit to households and business firms, thereby creating an additional drag on\nspending. The widely observed correlations between economic activity and measures of\nbank credit extension lend support to this theory. But causation can flow in the opposite\ndirection as well. When overall economic activity seems poised to contract, the outlook\n\n4\n\n\ffor household income and business revenues deteriorates as well, and borrowers become\nless creditworthy, all else constant. My reading of current conditions is that bank lending\nis constrained more now by the supply of creditworthy borrowers than by the supply of\nbank capital. This may explain why recent programs aimed at reducing credit spreads in\nparticular financial sectors seem to have had such limited effects; if credit market stress is\na symptom rather than a cause of the economic slowdown, then intervention in particular\ncredit markets may not be an effective demand management tool.\nThe decline in residential construction activity since early 2006 has affected not only\ncredit markets – it has had a significant impact on broader economic activity as well. For\na time, the weakness was isolated in the housing market and the rest of the economy\ncontinued to expand at a relatively healthy rate. But in late 2007, consumer spending\nbegan to slow. Household net worth has declined as home prices have fallen virtually\nnationwide over the last year-and-a-half, and, more recently, equity prices have slumped.\nIncreases in energy prices up through the middle of last year took a substantial bite out of\nreal incomes. Moreover, payroll employment peaked at the end of 2007, and has since\ndeclined by about 2 million jobs. As the labor market has weakened, wage growth has\ntapered off. Except for the temporary bulge due to the stimulus payments last year (which\ndid not, in the end, leave much trace on household spending), real personal income has\nsteadily decelerated, and is now below where it was a year ago. Given this catalog of\nadverse developments for U.S. households, it should be no surprise that consumer\nspending was sluggish in the first half of last year and has fallen significantly since then.\nWhen household spending slows substantially, investment is usually not far behind.\nBusiness spending on equipment and software fell in each of the first three quarters of\n2008, and the near-term outlook is not favorable. Many firms are facing dimmer sales\nprospects, higher funding costs, and more restrictive borrowing terms. Thus, further\nsoftening in this segment of business investment appears quite likely. Indeed, new orders\nfor capital goods are off sharply since the summer. The other segment of business fixed\ninvestment, spending on new structures, has been flourishing for some time now. Over\nthe three years leading up to the third quarter of 2008, real nonresidential fixed\ninvestment – a segment that includes office buildings, hotels, malls and the like – grew at\na 12 ¼ percent annual rate. That category seems to have slowed significantly in the\nsecond half of last year, although not as much as I had expected. Anecdotal reports\nindicate that the flow of new projects has diminished considerably, and it seems clear that\nnonresidential investment will decline over the course of this year, with only the\nmagnitude of slowing remaining uncertain.\nForeign trade was adding significantly to GDP growth until recently; net exports added\nover 1 ½ percentage points to real GDP growth for the first three quarters of 2008. Since\nthen, the trade contribution to U.S. growth has been declining in response to diminishing\nworld growth prospects and the recent strength in the dollar. As a result, we can’t count\non the foreign sector to offset weak domestic demand for goods and services going\nforward.\n\n5\n\n\fLast month, the National Bureau of Economic Research officially confirmed what\nvirtually all economists already knew – namely, that a recession began in December of\n2007 when payroll employment peaked. For a time, the decline was fairly mild – in fact,\nmilder than the last two recessions, both of which were themselves mild by historic\nstandards. But conditions began deteriorating much more rapidly after the extraordinary\ndeliberations in Congress in the second half of September. Since then, according to\nreports, many households and firms are taking a “wait and see” attitude, reducing or\npostponing nonessential outlays in response to a general sense of uncertainty about the\npotential meaning of these dramatic events for their own economic circumstances.\nEconomic indicators have weakened markedly across a wide array of sectors since then,\nand the current contraction in economic activity now appears to be on par with the\nrecessions of 1974-75 and 1981-82.\nLooking ahead, housing market conditions will be critical to the outlook for overall\neconomic growth. The housing market is by no means healthy right now; inventories of\nunsold, vacant homes are still large in many areas of the country, and, as a result, average\nhome prices still are declining at a rapid pace. Having said that, I find it hard to believe\nnew home construction has too much farther to fall, and that would imply that residential\ninvestment will soon exert much less of a drag on GDP.\nConsumer spending will be another key determinant of the growth outlook. Because\nhouseholds tend to base their consumption plans on their income prospects, any\nimprovement in consumer spending growth likely will depend on a shift to a more\noptimistic assessment of those prospects. Once households become convinced they can\nsee an end to the deterioration in labor market conditions and the fall in equity and home\nprices, consumer spending growth will be based on improving longer-run income\nprospects and is likely to pickup substantially. It’s too soon to tell just when and how\nrapidly that shift will occur, however.\nBut all told, it strikes me as reasonable to expect the U.S. economy to regain positive\nmomentum sometime in 2009, for several reasons. First, monetary policy is now quite\nstimulative and real interest rates are quite low. Second, the energy and commodity price\nshocks that dampened economic activity in the first half of last year have subsided\nalready or are in the process of doing so. And third, as I said, the drag from declining\nresidential investment seems likely to diminish significantly in the next year. In fact, I\nwould be surprised if we don’t see a bottom in housing construction sometime in 2009.\nWhile the downturn in real economic activity is going to pose challenges for monetary\npolicy in the period ahead, it’s essential that we not let inflation drift from view. Since\n2004, overall inflation has trended upward, and has been higher than I would like over\nthe last few years. Much of the acceleration we saw earlier last year reflected energy\nprices, however, and with oil prices down, we have seen overall inflation subside in\nrecent months. Moreover, many economists are forecasting relatively low inflation in the\nmonths ahead, on the grounds that widening economic slack is generally associated with\ndeclining price pressures. I would be cautious about relying on this correlation as a causal\nrelationship, however, even though it is detectable in many datasets. 6 There have been\n\n6\n\n\ftimes in the past when inflation declined only temporarily when activity slowed, and reaccelerated when the recovery began. And while it may seem premature to be worrying\nabout how inflation behaves after the recession is over, we need to be sure our policy\nremains consistent with a strategy that does not allow inflation to ratchet up over the\nbusiness cycle.\nAs I noted earlier, monetary policy is now quite accommodative. As growth prospects\ndeteriorated after August 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee has brought the\nfederal funds rate down from 5 ¼ percent to near zero. The fact that banks can always\nhold idle balances earning no interest will prevent further reductions in the funds rate\nfrom here. But even though it is common to think of policy in terms of the central bank’s\ninterest rate target, monetary policy fundamentally is always about the amount of\nmonetary liabilities issued by the central bank – also known as the “monetary base.”\nAfter all, hitting an interest rate target requires varying the quantity of central bank\nmoney, reducing the supply to raise rates and increasing the supply to reduce rates. Even\nwhen the policy rate has been driven down to zero, central banks can still dictate the\nsupply of central bank money.\nWhen interest rates approach zero, one often hears concerns about deflation, that is, a\nfalling price level. I do not believe that deflation is major risk right now. But deflation\ncan be dangerous because for any given interest rate, it increases the corresponding real\n(or inflation-adjusted) interest rate, and thus stifles growth. For a sustained deflation to\nemerge, people have to believe that the money supply will fall along with the price level.\nThat’s what happened during the first three years of the 1930s, at the beginning of the\nGreat Depression, when the U.S. consumer price index fell by 27 percent, and the\nmonetary base shrank by 28 percent. 7 Central banks can prevent deflation by credibly\ncommitting to keep the money supply from contracting. Such a commitment is a natural\nbyproduct of a credible commitment to price stability, but for a central bank that has not\nyet formally adopted an inflation objective, preventing deflation can present additional\nchallenges. This is why some central banks increase the quantity of their monetary\nliabilities dramatically when interest rates are at zero – to convince the public they will\nnot let the money supply contract in the future.\nThe monetary liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks have more than doubled over the\nlast several months, from around $840 billion the week ending September 11, to around\n$1.7 trillion the week ending December 31. Virtually all of this increase was in the form\nof bank reserves – the deposit balances that banks hold at their Federal Reserve Banks –\nwhich went from $8 billion to $848 billion over that period. (The rest of the monetary\nbase consists of paper currency.) This increase in the Fed’s money supply was a\nconsequence of the collection of credit programs initiated last fall. Prior to October, the\nFed was able to “sterilize” new lending through offsetting asset sales that soaked up the\nadditional bank reserves, which otherwise would have increased the monetary base. After\nOctober, the cumulative amount lent became too large to sterilize, and further lending\nadded to the monetary base. Luckily, the implementation of these large credit programs\ncoincided with a time in which additional monetary stimulus was warranted.\n\n7\n\n\fBut monetary policy and credit programs do two different things. Monetary policy\nstabilizes the purchasing power of money over time by keeping the price level stable and\nrelatively predictable, and by doing so, contributes to maximum sustainable economic\ngrowth. Credit policy is also aimed at promoting growth, but it is more a form of fiscal\npolicy in that it uses the public sector’s balance sheet to alter the allocation of resources.\nIn this instance, credit market interventions have been financed to some degree by the\nissue of new monetary liabilities, but they could just as well be financed with nonmonetary liabilities, such as U.S. Treasury securities.\nMixing monetary and fiscal policy is fraught with risks. Many historical instances of\nmonetary instability have been the result of central banks being prevailed upon to use\ntheir balance sheets for fiscal ends in ways that impeded their ability to keep inflation\nunder control. That is why in recent decades, countries around the world have provided a\nmeasure of independence to their central banks, within frameworks that ensure\naccountability, in order to explicitly insulate them from short-run political exigencies that\nmight diminish the credibility of their commitment to control inflation. The cornerstone\nof that framework in the United States dates back to 1951, when the Treasury-Fed\nAccord formally gave the Federal Reserve independent control of its balance sheet. 8\nBoth the short-term benefits and the long-term costs of central bank credit have been and\nwill no doubt continue to be debated for some time to come. 9 But no matter how one\nassesses the overall merits of such programs, it is important to recognize that these are\nfiscal measures that are distinct from monetary policy. While at the present time, credit\nprograms do not conflict with our monetary policy strategy, there could well come a time\nat which monetary stimulus needs to be withdrawn to prevent a resurgence of inflation,\neven though credit markets are not deemed fully healed. At that time, containing inflation\nmay require closing down credit programs, or finding an alternative, non-monetary\nfinancing arrangement for them. Price stability, after all, is the vital first ingredient in\nfinancial market stability.\n\n1\n\nA version of this speech was delivered at the annual meeting of the South Carolina Business & Industry\nPolitical Education Committee in Columbia, S.C., on January 13, 2009 and at the Maryland Bankers\nAssociation Annual Economic Outlook Forum in Linthicum, Md., on January 9, 2009.

Since the peak in activity in 2005, housing investment has fallen by more\nthan 40 percent. Average housing prices, as measured by the FHFA repeat sales index,\nhave fallen nearly 9 percent since their peak in April 2007.

A definitive assessment is too\nmuch to ask at this point, but a list of the most plausible suspects can easily be discerned.\nOne candidate that is often overlooked is the significant increase in productivity growth,\nand thus growth in real household income, which began around 1995 and lasted until\nsome time earlier in this decade. To the extent that households came to see the increase in\ntrend real income growth as likely to continue, one would expect to see a sustained rise in\nthe demand for housing. Moreover, current data suggest a decline in trend productivity\ngrowth in the middle of this decade, around the time housing demand peaked and began\nfalling.\n\n\fAnother plausible contributing factor was the wave of technological innovation in retail\ncredit delivery, which allowed lenders to make finer distinctions between potential\nborrowers. This facilitated lower interest rates for some borrowers and an expansion of\nlending to borrowers formerly viewed as unqualified for credit. As in any industry\nundergoing an innovation-driven structural shift (the telecommunications industry in the\nlate 1990s, for example), the natural evolution of the industry can involve overshooting\nand retrenchment. Subprime lending with high loan-to-value ratios was profitable while\nhome prices were rapidly rising, but profitability fell sharply when price trends reversed.\nHome price trends are hard to predict with any confidence, and lenders who found past\nsubprime mortgage lending profitable in 2004, 2005 and 2006 may have underestimated\nthe probability of a broad and sustained decline in home prices.\nThe regulatory and supervisory regime surrounding U.S. housing finance also seems\nlikely to have contributed to the boom in housing and housing finance. Here, several\nfactors deserve mention. Supervisory agencies, like borrowers, lenders and investors,\nassigned a low probability to the possibility of an adverse housing demand shift of the\nmagnitude and geographic extent that we have seen. In addition, private sector incentives\nto foresee and protect against such shocks were to some extent dampened by the presence\nof the federal financial safety net – that is, deposit insurance and the access of\ncommercial banking organizations to Federal Reserve lending. Market participants may\nhave inferred that a housing market shock that was large enough to afflict a broad swath\nof the financial system would elicit significant official support, particularly for\ninstitutions perceived as “too big to fail.”2 Past instances of government intervention to\nprevent large financial institutions from failing – from Continental Illinois to Long Term\nCapital Management – have encouraged such inferences. The federal safety net probably\nalso played a role in banks’ involvement in the securitization process at the heart of\nhousing finance, particularly among institutions perceived as too big to fail. The use of\noff-balance sheet arrangements and the provision of back-up lines of credit created\ncontingent exposures for the banking system that by design were most likely to be\nrealized in generally bad states of the world, when the safety-net protection of the formal\nbanking sector would be most valuable. In addition to these incentive problems, the\ninferred prospect of support for the government-sponsored housing finance enterprises,\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, lowered their borrowing costs and contributed to their\ndemand for mortgage-backed securities. Legislative incentives for such enterprises to\nextend credit to low-income borrowers also would have stimulated their demand for\nsecurities backed by subprime and nontraditional mortgages.\nAnother key causal suspect is the relatively low path of interest rates after the recession\nearlier this decade, especially in 2003 and 2004. Some economists have argued, with the\nbenefit of hindsight, that tighter monetary policy during that period would have led to\nbetter outcomes by preventing core inflation from rising, thus limiting the housing boom\nand mitigating the subsequent bust.3 This view strikes me as quite plausible, but again,\nfurther research will be required to substantiate this hypothesis.\n\n2\n\n\fThat’s all prologue, however, to the turmoil that has plagued financial markets since the\nmiddle of last year, when the potential scale of the home mortgage problem became more\nwidely appreciated. The turmoil intensified in mid-September of this year, and volatility\nhas been elevated since. Financial market participants have faced three major categories\nof uncertainty. The first concerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending.\nFor mortgages made in 2006 and early 2007 – the vintages in which losses are\nconcentrated – significant uncertainty still remains regarding total losses.\nSecond, financial market participants have faced uncertainty about where the losses will\nturn up. Mortgage risks were split up and spread widely, both within the United States\nand abroad, through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided by credit\nderivative contracts. As a result, financial market participants are understandably\napprehensive about whether a particular counterparty’s mortgage-related losses will\nerode their capital buffer enough to threaten their viability.\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector\nintervention.4 The disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile\norganizations this year may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast\nwhether official support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty. Shifts in\nexpectations regarding official intervention may have added volatility to financial asset\nmarkets that already were roiled by an increasingly uncertain growth outlook. And\nuncertainty about the form of government support – asset purchases versus dilutive\ncapital purchases, for example – may have hindered the provision of fresh equity capital.\nMost of what has been observed in financial market since the summer of 2007 is fairly\nintelligible in light of these sources of uncertainty facing market participants.\nApprehension about potential losses caused lenders to demand higher risk premia in\ninterbank credit markets for institutions with at least some presumed mortgage-related\nexposure. Market participants became especially concerned about the heightened risk\nassociated with lending at longer maturities, and so risk premia became especially\nelevated for term lending. Some borrowers were unwilling to pay higher premia for term\nloans, and shortened the tenor of their funding. Others were willing to pay the unusually\nhigh premia in order to “lock in” funding and protect themselves against an erosion in\ncounterparties’ perception of their creditworthiness. More broadly, the proliferation of\nintermediation channels in recent years has meant that for many borrowers, the next best\nfinancing option may not be much more costly. For example, many commercial paper\nissuers have back-up lines of credit with banks that they can draw on in the event they are\nunsatisfied with market pricing. Thus observing that a given intermediation channel is\n“frozen,” “clogged,” or “dried up” may not indicate dysfunction, per se, but may indicate\ninstead just a portfolio reallocation in response to a shift in risk assessments.\nThe striking feature of central bank lending and other government financial support\nduring the recent turmoil is the extent to which it has extended well beyond the\nboundaries that previously were understood to constrain such lending, both in the range\nof institutions and the contractual terms on which credit has been provided. Intervention\nhas been driven by a desire to prevent damaging disruptions to financial markets, and\n\n3\n\n\fthus reduce the overall costs of the turmoil. While this objective is clearly\nunderstandable, central bank lending can create the expectation that similar support will\nbe forthcoming when market disruptions occur in the future. Such expectations can\nthemselves be very costly, because they can distort the incentives faced by, and as a\nresult, the choices made by private-sector participants. For example, in the past year,\nexpectation of official support may have induced some firms to take the risk of turning\ndown capital infusions or merger offers in hopes of finding better terms in the future.\nProspective equity investors may have demanded stiffer terms to compensate for the\npossibility of dilutive government intervention. Clearly, these recent examples of the\nmoral hazard effects of official intervention are detrimental to broader public policy\nobjectives, and place a significant burden on the supervisors of financial institutions to\nconstrain such risk-taking.\nThe critical policy question of our time is where to establish the boundaries around the\npublic-sector safety net provided to financial market participants, now that the old\nboundaries are gone. In doing so, the prime directive should be that the extent of\nregulatory and supervisory oversight should match the extent of access to central bank\ncredit in order to contain moral hazard effectively. The dramatic recent expansion in\nFederal Reserve lending, and government support more broadly, has extended public\nsector support beyond existing supervisory reach, and thus could destabilize the financial\nsystem, if no corrective action is taken. Restoring consistency between the scope of\ngovernment support and the scope of government supervision is essential to a healthy and\nsustainable financial system. One option is simply to adapt our regulatory and\nsupervisory regime to the new wider implied reach of government lending support. This\nstrikes me as an unattractive option, if for no other reason than the current uncertainty\nabout the outer bounds of that support. Constraining moral hazard in such a regime would\nbe an immense and daunting task. I take it as given, therefore, that the scope of financial\nsafety net ultimately must be rolled back.\nNote that it will not be sufficient simply to roll back the current lending programs when\nthe economy begins recovering. The precedents that have been set during this episode\nwill influence how market participants expect policymakers to react during the next\nepisode of financial market turmoil. Establishing a coherent and stable financial\nregulatory regime will require rolling back expectations about how the policymakers will\nrespond to the next financial market disturbance or the next recession. Doing so will be\ndifficult. But rolling back those expectations will be impossible if moral hazard concerns\nare always set aside in the exigencies of a crisis.5\nAssessing the effects of the financial market turmoil on real economic growth is not as\nstraightforward as it might seem. One popular notion is that the credit market disruptions\nwe’ve seen over the last year or so impede the financial sector’s ability and willingness to\nextend credit to households and business firms, thereby creating an additional drag on\nspending. The widely observed correlations between economic activity and measures of\nbank credit extension lend support to this theory. But causation can flow in the opposite\ndirection as well. When overall economic activity seems poised to contract, the outlook\nfor household income and business revenues deteriorates as well, and borrowers become\n\n4\n\n\fless creditworthy, all else constant. My reading of current conditions is that bank lending\nis constrained more now by the supply of creditworthy borrowers than by the supply of\nbank capital. This may explain why recent programs aimed at reducing credit spreads in\nparticular financial sectors seem to have had such limited effects; if credit market stress is\na symptom rather than a cause of the economic slowdown, then intervention in particular\ncredit markets may not be an effective demand management tool.\nThe decline in residential construction activity since early 2006 has affected not only\ncredit markets – it has had a significant impact on broader economic activity as well. For\na time, the weakness was isolated in the housing market and the rest of the economy\ncontinued to expand at a relatively healthy rate. But in late 2007, consumer spending\nbegan to slow. Household net worth has declined as home prices have fallen virtually\nnationwide over the last year-and-a-half, and, more recently, equity prices have slumped.\nIncreases in energy prices up through the middle of last year took a substantial bite out of\nreal incomes. Moreover, payroll employment peaked at the end of 2007, and has since\ndeclined by about 2 million jobs. As the labor market has weakened, wage growth has\ntapered off. Except for the temporary bulge due to the stimulus payments last year (which\ndid not, in the end, leave much trace on household spending), real personal income has\nsteadily decelerated, and is now below where it was a year ago. Given this catalog of\nadverse developments for U.S. households, it should be no surprise that consumer\nspending was sluggish in the first half of last year and has fallen significantly since then.\nWhen household spending slows substantially, investment is usually not far behind.\nBusiness spending on equipment and software fell in each of the first three quarters of\n2008, and the near-term outlook is not favorable. Many firms are facing dimmer sales\nprospects, higher funding costs, and more restrictive borrowing terms. Thus, further\nsoftening in this segment of business investment appears quite likely. Indeed, new orders\nfor capital goods are off sharply since the summer. The other segment of business fixed\ninvestment, spending on new structures, has been flourishing for some time now. Over\nthe three years leading up to the third quarter of 2008, real nonresidential fixed\ninvestment – a segment that includes office buildings, hotels, malls and the like – grew at\na 12 ¼ percent annual rate. That category seems to have slowed significantly in the\nsecond half of last year, although not as much as I had expected. Anecdotal reports\nindicate that the flow of new projects has diminished considerably, and it seems clear that\nnonresidential investment will decline over the course of this year, with only the\nmagnitude of slowing remaining uncertain.\nForeign trade was adding significantly to GDP growth until recently; net exports added\nover 1 ½ percentage points to real GDP growth for the first three quarters of 2008. Since\nthen, the trade contribution to U.S. growth has been declining in response to diminishing\nworld growth prospects and the recent strength in the dollar. As a result, we can’t count\non the foreign sector to offset weak domestic demand for goods and services going\nforward.\nLast month, the National Bureau of Economic Research officially confirmed what\nvirtually all economists already knew – namely, that a recession began in December of\n\n5\n\n\f2007 when payroll employment peaked. For a time, the decline was fairly mild – in fact,\nmilder than the last two recessions, both of which were themselves mild by historic\nstandards. But conditions began deteriorating much more rapidly after the extraordinary\ndeliberations in Congress in the second half of September. Since then, according to\nreports, many households and firms are taking a “wait and see” attitude, reducing or\npostponing nonessential outlays in response to a general sense of uncertainty about the\npotential meaning of these dramatic events for their own economic circumstances.\nEconomic indicators have weakened markedly across a wide array of sectors since then,\nand the current contraction in economic activity now appears to be on par with the\nrecessions of 1974-75 and 1981-82.\nLooking ahead, housing market conditions will be critical to the outlook for overall\neconomic growth. The housing market is by no means healthy right now; inventories of\nunsold, vacant homes are still large in many areas of the country, and, as a result, average\nhome prices still are declining at a rapid pace. Having said that, I find it hard to believe\nnew home construction has too much farther to fall, and that would imply that residential\ninvestment will soon exert much less of a drag on GDP.\nConsumer spending will be another key determinant of the growth outlook. Because\nhouseholds tend to base their consumption plans on their income prospects, any\nimprovement in consumer spending growth likely will depend on a shift to a more\noptimistic assessment of those prospects. Once households become convinced they can\nsee an end to the deterioration in labor market conditions and the fall in equity and home\nprices, consumer spending growth will be based on improving longer-run income\nprospects and is likely to pickup substantially. It’s too soon to tell just when and how\nrapidly that shift will occur, however.\nBut all told, it strikes me as reasonable to expect the U.S. economy to regain positive\nmomentum sometime in 2009, for several reasons. First, monetary policy is now quite\nstimulative and real interest rates are quite low. Second, the energy and commodity price\nshocks that dampened economic activity last year have subsided already or are in the\nprocess of doing so. And third, as I said, the drag from declining residential investment\nseems likely to diminish significantly in the next year. In fact, I would be surprised if we\ndon’t see a bottom in housing construction sometime in 2009.\nWhile the downturn in real economic activity is going to pose challenges for monetary\npolicy in the period ahead, it’s essential that we not let inflation drift from view. Since\n2004, overall inflation has trended upward, and has been higher than I would like over\nthe last few years. Much of the acceleration we saw last year reflected energy prices,\nhowever, and with oil prices down, we have seen overall inflation subside in recent\nmonths. Moreover, many economists are forecasting relatively low inflation in the\nmonths ahead, on the grounds that widening economic slack is generally associated with\ndeclining price pressures. I would be cautious about relying on this correlation as a causal\nrelationship, however, even though it is detectable in many datasets.6 There have been\ntimes in the past when inflation declined only temporarily when activity slowed, and reaccelerated when the recovery began. And while it may seem premature to be worrying\n\n6\n\n\fabout how inflation behaves after the recession is over, we need to be sure our policy\nremains consistent with a strategy that does not allow inflation to ratchet up over the\nbusiness cycle.\nAs I noted earlier, monetary policy is now quite accommodative. As growth prospects\ndeteriorated after August 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee has brought the\nfederal funds rate down from 5 ¼ percent to near zero. The fact that banks can always\nhold idle balances earning no interest will prevent further reductions in the funds rate\nfrom here. But even though it is common to think of policy in terms of the central bank’s\ninterest rate target, monetary policy fundamentally is always about the amount of\nmonetary liabilities issued by the central bank – also known as the “monetary base.”\nAfter all, hitting an interest rate target requires varying the quantity of central bank\nmoney, reducing the supply to raise rates and increasing the supply to reduce rates. Even\nwhen the policy rate has been driven down to zero, central banks can still dictate the\nsupply of central bank money.\nWhen interest rates approach zero, one often hears concerns about deflation, that is, a\nfalling price level. I do not believe that deflation is major risk right now. But deflation\ncan be dangerous because for any given interest rate, it increases the corresponding real\n(or inflation-adjusted) interest rate, and thus stifles growth. For a sustained deflation to\nemerge, people have to believe that the money supply will fall along with the price level.\nThat’s what happened during the first three years of the 1930s, at the beginning of the\nGreat Depression, when the U.S. consumer price index fell by 27 percent, and the\nmonetary base shrank by 28 percent.7 Central banks can prevent deflation by credibly\ncommitting to keep the money supply from contracting. Such a commitment is a natural\nbyproduct of a credible commitment to price stability, but for a central bank that has not\nyet formally adopted an inflation objective, preventing deflation can present additional\nchallenges. This is why some central banks increase the quantity of their monetary\nliabilities dramatically when interest rates are at zero – to convince the public they will\nnot let the money supply contract in the future.\nThe monetary liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks have more than doubled over the\nlast several months, from around $840 billion the week ending September 11, to around\n$1.7 trillion the week ending December 31. Virtually all of this increase was in the form\nof bank reserves – the deposit balances that banks hold at their Federal Reserve Banks –\nwhich went from $8 billion to $848 billion over that period. (The rest of the monetary\nbase consists of paper currency.) This increase in the Fed’s money supply was a\nconsequence of the collection of credit programs initiated last fall. Prior to October, the\nFed was able to “sterilize” new lending through offsetting asset sales that soaked up the\nadditional bank reserves, which otherwise would have increased the monetary base. After\nOctober, the cumulative amount lent became too large to sterilize, and further lending\nadded to the monetary base. Luckily, the implementation of these large credit programs\ncoincided with a time in which additional monetary stimulus was warranted.\nBut monetary policy and credit programs do two different things. Monetary policy\nstabilizes the purchasing power of money over time by keeping the price level stable and\n\n7\n\n\frelatively predictable, and by doing so, contributes to maximum sustainable economic\ngrowth. Credit policy is also aimed at promoting growth, but it is more a form of fiscal\npolicy in that it uses the public sector’s balance sheet to alter the allocation of resources.\nIn this instance, credit market interventions have been financed to some degree by the\nissue of new monetary liabilities, but they could just as well be financed with nonmonetary liabilities, such as U.S. Treasury securities.\nMixing monetary and fiscal policy is fraught with risks. Many historical instances of\nmonetary instability have been the result of central banks being prevailed upon to use\ntheir balance sheets for fiscal ends in ways that impeded their ability to keep inflation\nunder control. That is why in recent decades, countries around the world have provided a\nmeasure of independence to their central banks, within frameworks that ensure\naccountability, in order to explicitly insulate them from short-run political exigencies that\nmight diminish the credibility of their commitment to control inflation. The cornerstone\nof that framework in the United States dates back to 1951, when the Treasury-Fed\nAccord formally gave the Federal Reserve independent control of its balance sheet.8\nBoth the short-term benefits and the long-term costs of central bank credit have been and\nwill no doubt continue to be debated for some time to come.9 But no matter how one\nassesses the overall merits of such programs, it is important to recognize that these are\nfiscal measures that are distinct from monetary policy. While at the present time, credit\nprograms do not conflict with our monetary policy strategy, there could well come a time\nat which monetary stimulus needs to be withdrawn to prevent a resurgence of inflation,\neven though credit markets are not deemed fully healed. At that time, containing inflation\nmay require closing down credit programs, or finding an alternative, non-monetary\nfinancing arrangement for them. Price stability, after all, is the vital first ingredient in\nfinancial market stability.\n\n1\n\nA version of this speech was delivered at the Maryland Bankers Association Annual Economic Outlook\nForum in Linthicum, Maryland on January 9, 2009.

            "content": "Financial Conditions and the Economic Outlook\nMaryland Bankers Association Annual Economic Outlook Forum\nLinthicum, Maryland\nJanuary 9, 2009\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThe beginning of a new calendar year is a popular occasion for discussing the outlook for future\neconomic conditions. Recent trends to some extent have dampened enthusiasm for this annual\nexercise. On the other hand, uncertainty about the economic outlook looms particularly large\nnow, and the economic policy challenges we face are particularly profound, so perhaps the\nreturns to such a discussion are above average this year, even if our zeal for the topic is a bit\nbelow average.\nThe basis for dampened enthusiasm regarding this year’s economic outlook is fairly clear. The\nU.S. economy has been in a recession for a year now, and the pace of the contraction in economic\nactivity appeared to increase markedly around the end of September. In my remarks today, I will\ndiscuss the factors I see affecting the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy. As\nalways, the views I express will be my own, and may not coincide exactly with the views of all of\nmy Federal Reserve System colleagues. i I will devote special attention to recent financial market\nconditions, because the financial market turbulence that has been so striking over the last yearand-a-half looms large in any discussion of the economy and economic policy these days.\nThe proximate cause of the financial market turbulence, of course, is the home mortgages made\nfrom late 2005 through early 2007, near the end of long U.S. housing boom that began in 1995.\nSince the peak in activity in 2005, housing investment has fallen by more than 40 percent.\nAverage housing prices, as measured by the FHFA repeat sales index, have fallen nearly 9\npercent since their peak in April 2007. The resulting erosion in home equity for many borrowers\nhas meant that mortgages made near the peak of the boom, especially the subprime and nontraditional categories, are experiencing much larger losses than expected.\nIt will take years of research to untangle the quantitative contribution of various causal factors to\nthe decade-long housing boom, the accompanying rise in subprime mortgage lending, and the\nsubsequent increase in mortgage losses. A definitive assessment is too much to ask at this point,\nbut a list of the most plausible suspects can easily be discerned. One candidate that is often\noverlooked is the significant increase in productivity growth, and thus growth in real household\nincome, which began around 1995 and lasted until some time earlier in this decade. To the extent\n\n\fthat households came to see the increase in trend real income growth as likely to continue, one\nwould expect to see a sustained rise in the demand for housing. Moreover, current data suggest a\ndecline in trend productivity growth in the middle of this decade, around the time housing\ndemand peaked and began falling.\nAnother plausible contributing factor was the wave of technological innovation in retail credit\ndelivery, which allowed lenders to make finer distinctions between potential borrowers. This\nfacilitated lower interest rates for some borrowers and an expansion of lending to borrowers\nformerly viewed as unqualified for credit. As in any industry undergoing an innovation-driven\nstructural shift (the telecommunications industry in the late 1990s, for example), the natural\nevolution of the industry can involve overshooting and retrenchment. Subprime lending with high\nloan-to-value ratios was profitable while home prices were rapidly rising, but profitability fell\nsharply when price trends reversed. Home price trends are hard to predict with any confidence,\nand lenders who found past subprime mortgage lending profitable in 2004, 2005 and 2006 may\nhave underestimated the probability of a broad and sustained decline in home prices.\nThe regulatory and supervisory regime surrounding U.S. housing finance also seems likely to\nhave contributed to the boom in housing and housing finance. Here, several factors deserve\nmention. Supervisory agencies, like borrowers, lenders and investors, assigned a low probability\nto the possibility of an adverse housing demand shift of the magnitude and geographic extent that\nwe have seen. In addition, private sector incentives to foresee and protect against such shocks\nwere to some extent dampened by the presence of the federal financial safety net – that is, deposit\ninsurance and the access of commercial banking organizations to Federal Reserve lending.\nMarket participants may have inferred that a housing market shock that was large enough to\nafflict a broad swath of the financial system would elicit significant official support, particularly\nfor institutions perceived as “too big to fail.” ii Past instances of government intervention to\nprevent large financial institutions from failing – from Continental Illinois to Long Term Capital\nManagement – have encouraged such inferences. The federal safety net probably also played a\nrole in banks’ involvement in the securitization process at the heart of housing finance,\nparticularly among institutions perceived as too big to fail. The use of off-balance sheet\narrangements and the provision of back-up lines of credit created contingent exposures for the\nbanking system that by design were most likely to be realized in generally bad states of the world,\nwhen the safety-net protection of the formal banking sector would be most valuable. In addition\nto these incentive problems, the inferred prospect of support for the government-sponsored\nhousing finance enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, lowered their borrowing costs and\ncontributed to their demand for mortgage-backed securities. Legislative incentives for such\nenterprises to extend credit to low-income borrowers also would have stimulated their demand for\nsecurities backed by subprime and nontraditional mortgages.\nAnother key causal suspect is the relatively low path of interest rates after the recession earlier\nthis decade, especially in 2003 and 2004. Some economists have argued, with the benefit of\nhindsight, that tighter monetary policy during that period would have led to better outcomes by\npreventing core inflation from rising, thus limiting the housing boom and mitigating the\nsubsequent bust. iii This view strikes me as quite plausible, but again, further research will be\nrequired to substantiate this hypothesis.\nThat’s all prologue, however, to the turmoil that has plagued financial markets since the middle of\nlast year, when the potential scale of the home mortgage problem became more widely\nappreciated. The turmoil intensified in mid-September of this year, and volatility has been\n\n\felevated since. Financial market participants have faced three major categories of uncertainty.\nThe first concerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending. For mortgages made in\n2006 and early 2007 – the vintages in which losses are concentrated – significant uncertainty still\nremains regarding total losses.\nSecond, financial market participants have faced uncertainty about where the losses will turn up.\nMortgage risks were split up and spread widely, both within the United States and abroad,\nthrough securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided by credit derivative\ncontracts. As a result, financial market participants are understandably apprehensive about\nwhether a particular counterparty’s mortgage-related losses will erode their capital buffer enough\nto threaten their viability.\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector\nintervention. iv The disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile organizations\nthis year may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast whether official support\nwould be forthcoming for a given counterparty. Shifts in expectations regarding official\nintervention may have added volatility to financial asset markets that already were roiled by an\nincreasingly uncertain growth outlook. And uncertainty about the form of government support –\nasset purchases versus dilutive capital purchases, for example – may have hindered the provision\nof fresh equity capital.\nMost of what has been observed in financial market since the summer of 2007 is fairly intelligible\nin light of these sources of uncertainty facing market participants. Apprehension about potential\nlosses caused lenders to demand higher risk premia in interbank credit markets for institutions\nwith at least some presumed mortgage-related exposure. Market participants became especially\nconcerned about the heightened risk associated with lending at longer maturities, and so risk\npremia became especially elevated for term lending. Some borrowers were unwilling to pay\nhigher premia for term loans, and shortened the tenor of their funding. Others were willing to pay\nthe unusually high premia in order to “lock in” funding and protect themselves against an erosion\nin counterparties’ perception of their creditworthiness. More broadly, the proliferation of\nintermediation channels in recent years has meant that for many borrowers, the next best\nfinancing option may not be much more costly. For example, many commercial paper issuers\nhave back-up lines of credit with banks that they can draw on in the event they are unsatisfied\nwith market pricing. Thus observing that a given intermediation channel is “frozen,” “clogged,”\nor “dried up” may not indicate dysfunction, per se, but may indicate instead just a portfolio\nreallocation in response to a shift in risk assessments.\nThe striking feature of central bank lending and other government financial support during the\nrecent turmoil is the extent to which it has extended well beyond the boundaries that previously\nwere understood to constrain such lending, both in the range of institutions and the contractual\nterms on which credit has been provided. Intervention has been driven by a desire to prevent\ndamaging disruptions to financial markets, and thus reduce the overall costs of the turmoil. While\nthis objective is clearly understandable, central bank lending can create the expectation that\nsimilar support will be forthcoming when market disruptions occur in the future. Such\nexpectations can themselves be very costly, because they can distort the incentives faced by, and\nas a result, the choices made by private-sector participants. For example, in the past year,\nexpectation of official support may have induced some firms to take the risk of turning down\ncapital infusions or merger offers in hopes of finding better terms in the future. Prospective equity\ninvestors may have demanded stiffer terms to compensate for the possibility of dilutive\n\n\fgovernment intervention. Clearly, these recent examples of the moral hazard effects of official\nintervention are detrimental to broader public policy objectives, and place a significant burden on\nthe supervisors of financial institutions to constrain such risk-taking.\nThe critical policy question of our time is where to establish the boundaries around the publicsector safety net provided to financial market participants, now that the old boundaries are gone.\nIn doing so, the prime directive should be that the extent of regulatory and supervisory oversight\nshould match the extent of access to central bank credit in order to contain moral hazard\neffectively. The dramatic recent expansion in Federal Reserve lending, and government support\nmore broadly, has extended public sector support beyond existing supervisory reach, and thus\ncould destabilize the financial system, if no corrective action is taken. Restoring consistency\nbetween the scope of government support and the scope of government supervision is essential to\na healthy and sustainable financial system. One option is simply to adapt our regulatory and\nsupervisory regime to the new wider implied reach of government lending support. This strikes\nme as an unattractive option, if for no other reason than the current uncertainty about the outer\nbounds of that support. Constraining moral hazard in such a regime would be an immense and\ndaunting task. I take it as given, therefore, that the scope of financial safety net ultimately must be\nrolled back.\nNote that it will not be sufficient simply to roll back the current lending programs when the\neconomy begins recovering. The precedents that have been set during this episode will influence\nhow market participants expect policymakers to react during the next episode of financial market\nturmoil. Establishing a coherent and stable financial regulatory regime will require rolling back\nexpectations about how the policymakers will respond to the next financial market disturbance or\nthe next recession. Doing so will be difficult. But rolling back those expectations will be\nimpossible if moral hazard concerns are always set aside in the exigencies of a crisis. v\nAssessing the effects of the financial market turmoil on real economic growth is not as\nstraightforward as it might seem. One popular notion is that the credit market disruptions we’ve\nseen over the last year or so impede the financial sector’s ability and willingness to extend credit\nto households and business firms, thereby creating an additional drag on spending. The widely\nobserved correlations between economic activity and measures of bank credit extension lend\nsupport to this theory. But causation can flow in the opposite direction as well. When overall\neconomic activity seems poised to contract, the outlook for household income and business\nrevenues deteriorates as well, and borrowers become less creditworthy, all else constant. My\nreading of current conditions is that bank lending is constrained more now by the supply of\ncreditworthy borrowers than by the supply of bank capital. This may explain why recent\nprograms aimed at reducing credit spreads in particular financial sectors seem to have had such\nlimited effects; if credit market stress is a symptom rather than a cause of the economic\nslowdown, then intervention in particular credit markets may not be an effective demand\nmanagement tool.\nThe decline in residential construction activity since early 2006 has affected not only credit\nmarkets – it has had a significant impact on broader economic activity as well. For a time, the\nweakness was isolated in the housing market and the rest of the economy continued to expand at a\nrelatively healthy rate. But in late 2007, consumer spending began to slow. Household net worth\nhas declined as home prices have fallen virtually nationwide over the last year-and-a-half, and,\nmore recently, equity prices have slumped. Increases in energy prices up through the middle of\nlast year took a substantial bite out of real incomes. Moreover, payroll employment peaked at the\n\n\fend of 2007, and has since declined by about 2 million jobs. As the labor market has weakened,\nwage growth has tapered off. Except for the temporary bulge due to the stimulus payments last\nyear (which did not, in the end, leave much trace on household spending), real personal income\nhas steadily decelerated, and is now below where it was a year ago. Given this catalog of adverse\ndevelopments for U.S. households, it should be no surprise that consumer spending was sluggish\nin the first half of last year and has fallen significantly since then.\nWhen household spending slows substantially, investment is usually not far behind. Business\nspending on equipment and software fell in each of the first three quarters of 2008, and the nearterm outlook is not favorable. Many firms are facing dimmer sales prospects, higher funding\ncosts, and more restrictive borrowing terms. Thus, further softening in this segment of business\ninvestment appears quite likely. Indeed, new orders for capital goods are off sharply since the\nsummer. The other segment of business fixed investment, spending on new structures, has been\nflourishing for some time now. Over the three years leading up to the third quarter of 2008, real\nnonresidential fixed investment – a segment that includes office buildings, hotels, malls and the\nlike – grew at a 12 ¼ percent annual rate. That category seems to have slowed significantly in the\nsecond half of last year, although not as much as I had expected. Anecdotal reports indicate that\nthe flow of new projects has diminished considerably, and it seems clear that nonresidential\ninvestment will decline over the course of this year, with only the magnitude of slowing\nremaining uncertain.\nForeign trade was adding significantly to GDP growth until recently; net exports added over 1 ½\npercentage points to real GDP growth for the first three quarters of 2008. Since then, the trade\ncontribution to U.S. growth has been declining in response to diminishing world growth prospects\nand the recent strength in the dollar. As a result, we can’t count on the foreign sector to offset\nweak domestic demand for goods and services going forward.\nLast month, the National Bureau of Economic Research officially confirmed what virtually all\neconomists already knew – namely, that a recession began in December of 2007 when payroll\nemployment peaked. For a time, the decline was fairly mild – in fact, milder than the last two\nrecessions, both of which were themselves mild by historic standards. But conditions began\ndeteriorating much more rapidly after the extraordinary deliberations in Congress in the second\nhalf of September. Since then, according to reports, many households and firms are taking a “wait\nand see” attitude, reducing or postponing nonessential outlays in response to a general sense of\nuncertainty about the potential meaning of these dramatic events for their own economic\ncircumstances. Economic indicators have weakened markedly across a wide array of sectors since\nthen, and the current contraction in economic activity now appears to be on par with the\nrecessions of 1974-75 and 1981-82.\nLooking ahead, housing market conditions will be critical to the outlook for overall economic\ngrowth. The housing market is by no means healthy right now; inventories of unsold, vacant\nhomes are still large in many areas of the country, and, as a result, average home prices still are\ndeclining at a rapid pace. Having said that, I find it hard to believe new home construction has too\nmuch farther to fall, and that would imply that residential investment will soon exert much less of\na drag on GDP.\nConsumer spending will be another key determinant of the growth outlook. Because households\ntend to base their consumption plans on their income prospects, any improvement in consumer\nspending growth likely will depend on a shift to a more optimistic assessment of those prospects.\n\n\fOnce households become convinced they can see an end to the deterioration in labor market\nconditions and the fall in equity and home prices, consumer spending growth will be based on\nimproving longer-run income prospects and is likely to pickup substantially. It’s too soon to tell\njust when and how rapidly that shift will occur, however.\nBut all told, it strikes me as reasonable to expect the U.S. economy to regain positive momentum\nsometime in 2009, for several reasons. First, monetary policy is now quite stimulative and real\ninterest rates are quite low. Second, the energy and commodity price shocks that dampened\neconomic activity earlier this year have subsided already or are in the process of doing so. And\nthird, as I said, the drag from declining residential investment seems likely to diminish\nsignificantly in the next year. In fact, I would be surprised if we don’t see a bottom in housing\nconstruction sometime in 2009.\nWhile the downturn in real economic activity is going to pose challenges for monetary policy in\nthe period ahead, it’s essential that we not let inflation drift from view. Since 2004, overall\ninflation has trended upward, and has been higher than I would like over the last few years. Much\nof the acceleration we saw earlier this year reflected energy prices, however, and with oil prices\ndown, we have seen overall inflation subside in recent months. Moreover, many economists are\nforecasting relatively low inflation in the months ahead, on the grounds that widening economic\nslack is generally associated with declining price pressures. I would be cautious about relying on\nthis correlation as a causal relationship, however, even though it is detectable in many datasets. vi\nThere have been times in the past when inflation declined only temporarily when activity slowed,\nand re-accelerated when the recovery began. And while it may seem premature to be worrying\nabout how inflation behaves after the recession is over, we need to be sure our policy remains\nconsistent with a strategy that does not allow inflation to ratchet up over the business cycle.\nAs I noted earlier, monetary policy is now quite accommodative. As growth prospects\ndeteriorated after August 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee has brought the federal\nfunds rate down from 5 ¼ percent to near zero. The fact that banks can always hold idle balances\nearning no interest will prevent further reductions in the funds rate from here. But even though it\nis common to think of policy in terms of the central bank’s interest rate target, monetary policy\nfundamentally is always about the amount of monetary liabilities issued by the central bank – also\nknown as the “monetary base.” After all, hitting an interest rate target requires varying the\nquantity of central bank money, reducing the supply to raise rates and increasing the supply to\nreduce rates. Even when the policy rate has been driven down to zero, central banks can still\ndictate the supply of central bank money.\nWhen interest rates approach zero, one often hears concerns about deflation, that is, a falling price\nlevel. I do not believe that deflation is major risk right now. But deflation can be dangerous\nbecause for any given interest rate, it increases the corresponding real (or inflation-adjusted)\ninterest rate, and thus stifles growth. For a sustained deflation to emerge, people have to believe\nthat the money supply will fall along with the price level. That’s what happened during the first\nthree years of the 1930s, at the beginning of the Great Depression, when the U.S. consumer price\nindex fell by 27 percent, and the monetary base shrank by 28 percent. vii Central banks can prevent\ndeflation by credibly committing to keep the money supply from contracting. Such a commitment\nis a natural byproduct of a credible commitment to price stability, but for a central bank that has\nnot yet formally adopted an inflation objective, preventing deflation can present additional\nchallenges. This is why some central banks increase the quantity of their monetary liabilities\n\n\fdramatically when interest rates are at zero – to convince the public they will not let the money\nsupply contract in the future.\nThe monetary liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks have more than doubled over the last\nseveral months, from around $840 billion the week ending September 11, to around $1.7 trillion\nthe week ending December 31. Virtually all of this increase was in the form of bank reserves –\nthe deposit balances that banks hold at their Federal Reserve Banks – which went from $8 billion\nto $848 billion over that period. (The rest of the monetary base consists of paper currency.) This\nincrease in the Fed’s money supply was a consequence of the collection of credit programs\ninitiated last fall. Prior to October, the Fed was able to “sterilize” new lending through offsetting\nasset sales that soaked up the additional bank reserves, which otherwise would have increased the\nmonetary base. After October, the cumulative amount lent became too large to sterilize, and\nfurther lending added to the monetary base. Luckily, the implementation of these large credit\nprograms coincided with a time in which additional monetary stimulus was warranted.\nBut monetary policy and credit programs do two different things. Monetary policy stabilizes the\npurchasing power of money over time by keeping the price level stable and relatively predictable,\nand by doing so, contributes to maximum sustainable economic growth. Credit policy is also\naimed at promoting growth, but it is more a form of fiscal policy in that it uses the public sector’s\nbalance sheet to alter the allocation of resources. In this instance, credit market interventions have\nbeen financed to some degree by the issue of new monetary liabilities, but they could just as well\nbe financed with non-monetary liabilities, such as U.S. Treasury securities.\nMixing monetary and fiscal policy is fraught with risks. Many historical instances of monetary\ninstability have been the result of central banks being prevailed upon to use their balance sheets\nfor fiscal ends in ways that impeded their ability to keep inflation under control. That is why in\nrecent decades, countries around the world have provided a measure of independence to their\ncentral banks, within frameworks that ensure accountability, in order to explicitly insulate them\nfrom short-run political exigencies that might diminish the credibility of their commitment to\ncontrol inflation. The cornerstone of that framework in the United States dates back to 1951,\nwhen the Treasury-Fed Accord formally gave the Federal Reserve independent control of its\nbalance sheet. viii\nBoth the short-term benefits and the long-term costs of central bank credit have been and will no\ndoubt continue to be debated for some time to come. ix But no matter how one assesses the overall\nmerits of such programs, it is important to recognize that these are fiscal measures that are distinct\nfrom monetary policy. While at the present time, credit programs do not conflict with our\nmonetary policy strategy, there could well come a time at which monetary stimulus needs to be\nwithdrawn to prevent a resurgence of inflation, even though credit markets are not deemed fully\nhealed. At that time, containing inflation may require closing down credit programs, or finding an\nalternative, non-monetary financing arrangement for them. Price stability, after all, is the vital\nfirst ingredient in financial market stability.\n\ni\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this address.\nGary H.

            "content": "Financial Conditions and the Economic Outlook\nEconomic Outlook Conference, Charlotte Chamber of Commerce\nCharlotte, N.C.\nDecember 3, 2008\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nThese are economically trying times. In my remarks, I would like to discuss the factors I\nsee affecting the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy. As always, I speak\nonly for myself, and not for my Federal Reserve System colleagues. 1\nFinancial market conditions loom large in any discussion of the economy these days. The\nheart of the problem, of course, is the home mortgages made from late 2005 through\nearly 2007, near the end of the long U.S. housing boom that began in 1995. Since the\npeak in activity in 2005, housing investment has fallen by more than 40 percent. Average\nhousing prices, as measured by the FHFA repeat sales index, have fallen 6 ½ percent\nsince their peak in April 2007. Some markets have experienced more dramatic declines;\nthe home price index for California fell 18 percent, for example. The resulting erosion in\nhome equity for many borrowers has meant that mortgages made near the peak of the\nboom, especially the subprime and non-traditional categories, are experiencing much\nlarger losses than expected.\nIt will take years of research to untangle the quantitative contribution of various causal\nfactors to the rise in subprime mortgage lending and the increase in subprime losses, so I\nwon’t attempt such an analysis here. Let me simply offer a list of plausible suspects. One\ncandidate is the wave of technological innovation in retail credit delivery, which\ncontributed to an expansion of consumer credit, including unsecured and mortgage credit.\nAs in any industry in the midst of innovation, this expansion may have involved\novershooting and retrenchment.\nA second suspect is the regulatory and supervisory framework surrounding U.S. housing\nfinance, which may have been insufficiently prepared for the possibility of a swing in\nhousing demand of the magnitude and geographic extent that we have seen. Private sector\nincentives to foresee and protect against such shocks were to some extent dampened by\nthe presence of the federal financial safety net, and perhaps by official policies aimed at\nincreasing homeownership. In addition, the unscrupulous and fraudulent practices of\nsome mortgage brokers outside of the banking sector may have contributed to the\nproblem.\nI would also cite relatively low interest rates after the recession earlier this decade,\nespecially in 2003 and 2004. Some economists have argued, with the benefit of hindsight,\nthat tighter monetary policy during that period would have led to better outcomes by\npreventing core inflation from rising, thus limiting the housing boom and mitigating the\n\n\fsubsequent bust. 2 While I find this view plausible, again, further research will be required\nto substantiate this hypothesis.\nThat’s all prologue, however, to the turmoil that has plagued financial markets since the\nmiddle of last year, when the potential scale of the home mortgage problem became more\nwidely appreciated. The turmoil intensified in mid-September this year, and volatility has\nbeen elevated since. Financial market participants have faced three major categories of\nuncertainty. The first concerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending. For\nmortgages made in 2006 and early 2007 – the vintages in which losses are concentrated –\nsignificant uncertainty still remains regarding total losses.\nSecond, financial market participants face uncertainty about where the losses will turn up.\nMortgage risks were split up and spread widely, both within the United States and in\nEurope, through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided by credit\nderivative contracts. As a result, financial market participants are understandably\napprehensive about whether a particular counterparty’s mortgage-related losses will\nerode their capital buffer enough to threaten their viability. This has led to elevated risk\npremia in interbank credit markets for institutions with at least some presumed mortgagerelated exposure.\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector\nintervention. 3 The disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile\norganizations this year may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast\nwhether and in what form official support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty.\nShifts in expectations regarding official intervention may have added volatility to\nfinancial asset markets that already were roiled by an increasingly uncertain growth\noutlook.\nThe striking feature of central bank lending during the recent turmoil is the extent to\nwhich it has extended well beyond the boundaries that previously were understood to\nconstrain such lending, both in the range of institutions and the contractual terms on\nwhich credit has been provided. Intervention has been driven by a desire to prevent\ndamaging disruptions to financial markets, and thus reduce the overall costs of the\nturmoil. While this objective is clearly understandable, central bank lending can create\nthe expectation that similar support will be forthcoming when market disruptions occur in\nthe future. Such expectations can themselves be very costly, because they can distort the\nincentives faced by, and as a result, the choices made by private-sector participants.\nThe critical policy question of our time is where to establish the boundaries around the\npublic-sector safety net provided to financial market participants, now that the old\nboundaries are gone. In doing so, the prime directive should be that the extent of\nregulatory and supervisory oversight should be commensurate with the extent of access to\ncentral bank credit in order to contain moral hazard effectively. The dramatic recent\nexpansion in Federal Reserve lending, and government support more broadly, has\nextended public sector support beyond existing supervisory reach, and thus could\ndestabilize the financial system, if no corrective action is taken. Restoring consistency\n\n2\n\n\fbetween the scope of government support and the scope of government supervision is\nessential to a healthy and sustainable financial system. One option is simply to adapt our\nregulatory and supervisory regime to the new wider implied reach of government lending\nsupport. This strikes me as an unattractive option, if for no other reason than the current\nuncertainty about the outer bounds of that support. Constraining moral hazard in such a\nregime would be an immense and daunting task. I take it as given, therefore, that the\nscope of financial safety net ultimately must be rolled back.\nNote that it will not be sufficient simply to roll back the current lending programs when\nthe economy recovers. The precedents that have been set during this episode will\ninfluence how market participants expect policymakers to react during the next episode\nof financial market turmoil. Establishing a coherent and stable financial regulatory\nregime will require rolling back expectations about how the policymakers will respond to\nthe next financial market disturbance. Rolling back those expectations will be impossible\nif moral hazard concerns are always set aside in the exigencies of a crisis. 4\nAssessing the effects of financial market turmoil on real economic spending is not as\nstraightforward as it might seem. One popular notion is that the credit market disruptions\nwe’ve seen over the last year or so impede the financial sector’s ability and willingness to\nextend credit to households and business firms, thereby creating an additional drag on\nspending. But causation can flow in the opposite direction as well. When overall\neconomic activity seems poised to contract, the outlook for household income and\nbusiness revenues deteriorates as well, and such borrowers become less creditworthy, all\nelse constant. My reading of current conditions is that bank lending is constrained more\nnow by the supply of creditworthy borrowers than by the supply of bank capital.\nThe decline in U.S. housing activity since early 2006 has affected not only credit markets\n– it has had a significant impact on broader economic activity as well. For a time, the\nweakness was isolated in the housing market, as the rest of the economy continued to\nexpand at a relatively healthy rate. But late last year, consumer spending began to slow.\nHousehold net worth has declined as home prices have fallen virtually nationwide over\nthe last year-and-a-half, and, more recently, equity prices have slumped. Increases in\nenergy prices up through the middle of this year took a substantial bite out of real\nincomes. Moreover, payroll employment peaked last December, and has since shed 1.2\nmillion jobs. As the labor market has weakened, wage growth has tapered off. Except for\nthe temporary bulge due to the stimulus payments earlier this year, real personal income\nhas steadily decelerated, and is now below where it was a year ago. Given this catalog of\nadverse developments for U.S. households, it should be no surprise that consumer\nspending was sluggish in the first half of the year and has fallen significantly in recent\nmonths.\nWhen household spending slows substantially, business capital investment is usually not\nfar behind. Business spending on equipment and software fell in the first half of 2008,\nand the near-term outlook is not favorable. Many firms are facing dimmer sales\nprospects, higher funding costs, and more restrictive borrowing terms. The other segment\nof business fixed investment, spending on new structures, has been booming recently. In\n\n3\n\n\f2007 and the first half of 2008, real nonresidential fixed investment – a segment that\nincludes office buildings, hotels, malls and the like – grew at a 14 percent annual rate.\nThat category seems to have topped out over the summer, and is certain to decline in\ncoming months.\nForeign trade has added significantly to GDP growth last year and the first half of this\nyear. Unfortunately, the trade contribution to U.S. growth is likely to decline in the near\nterm in response to diminishing world growth prospects and the recent strength in the\ndollar.\nTwo days ago, the National Bureau of Economic Research officially confirmed what\nvirtually all economists already knew – namely, that a recession began last December\nwhen payroll employment peaked. For a time, the decline was fairly mild – in fact milder\nthan the last two recessions, both of which were themselves mild by historic standards.\nBut conditions downshifted dramatically sometime in September, just as financial market\nturmoil was accelerating. Since then, according to reports, many households and firms\nare taking a “wait and see” attitude, reducing or postponing nonessential outlays in\nresponse to a general sense of uncertainty about the potential meaning of these dramatic\nevents for their own economic circumstances. A wide array of economic indicators has\ndeteriorated markedly since then as well.\nLooking ahead, uncertainty about the outlook is greater than usual, though probably not\ngreater than is typical for this phase of a business slowdown. It strikes me as reasonable\nto expect the U.S. economy to regain positive momentum sometime in 2009, for several\nreasons. First, monetary policy is now quite stimulative. Second, the energy and\ncommodity price shocks that dampened economic activity earlier this year have subsided\nalready or are in the process of doing so. And as I’ve mentioned, the drag from housing\nseems likely to lessen in the next year, and in fact, I would be surprised if we don’t see a\nbottom in housing construction sometime in 2009. This is the third straight year,\nhowever, that I’ve been expecting a bottom in the housing market in the middle of next\nyear, so my outlook is tempered by more than the usual amount of humility.\nWhile the downturn in real economic activity is going to pose challenges for monetary\npolicy in the period ahead, it’s essential that we not let inflation drift from view. Since\n2004, overall inflation has trended upward, and has been higher than I would like, over\nthe last few years. Much of the acceleration we saw earlier this year reflected energy\nprices, however, and with oil prices down we have seen overall inflation subside in recent\nmonths.\nMany economists are forecasting relatively low inflation in the months ahead, on the\ngrounds that widening economic slack is generally associated with declining price\npressures. While this correlation is detectable in many datasets, I would be cautious about\nrelying on it as a causal relationship. 5 And while it may seem premature to be worrying\nabout how inflation behaves after the recession is over, we need to be sure our policy\nremains consistent with a strategy that does not allow inflation to ratchet up over the\nbusiness cycle.\n\n4\n\n\fAs I said at the outset, these are not the best of economic times. We have weathered\neconomic downturns before, however, both nationally and globally. And there is no sign\nthat the fundamental creative process that drives innovation and improves well-being\nover time has been mortally wounded. What sets this episode apart is the nature of the\nturmoil plaguing the financial sector, and the array of unprecedented government lending\nprograms. While navigating the slowdown in real economic growth is a challenge, the\nlarger and more significant challenge will be to re-establish the boundaries around central\nbank lending and public sector support and reconstruct the relationship between the\npublic sector and financial markets. How well we meet this challenge will determine the\nextent to which innovation, despite the associated volatility, will continue to contribute to\nthe effectiveness of our financial system and to overall economic growth.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this address.

            "content": "Financial Conditions and the Economic Outlook\nTechnology Council of Maryland\nBethesda, Maryland\nNovember 21, 2008\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nWe gather during economically trying times, both in the United States and increasingly\naround the globe. In my remarks this morning, I would like to discuss the factors I see\naffecting the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy. As always, I speak only\nfor myself, and not for my Federal Reserve System colleagues.1\nFinancial market conditions loom large in any discussion of the economy these days. The\nheart of the problem, of course, is the home mortgages made from late 2005 through\nearly 2007, near the end of long U.S. housing boom that began in 1995. Since the peak in\nactivity in 2005, housing investment has fallen by more than 40 percent. Average housing\nprices, as measured by the FHFA repeat sales index, have fallen 6.5 percent since their\npeak in April 2007. Some markets have experienced more dramatic declines; the home\nprice index for California fell 18 percent, for example. The resulting erosion in home\nequity for many borrowers has meant that mortgages made near the peak of the boom,\nespecially the subprime and non-traditional categories, are experiencing much larger\nlosses than expected.\nIt will take years of research to untangle the quantitative contribution of various causal\nfactors to the rise in subprime mortgage lending and the increase in subprime losses, so I\nwon’t attempt such an analysis here. But the list of plausible suspects is clear. First,\ntechnological innovation in retail credit delivery allowed lenders to make finer\ndistinctions between borrowers and profitably expand lending to borrowers formerly\nunworthy of credit. As in any industry in the midst of undergoing innovation, such as\ncredit cards in the 1990s for example, natural evolution can involve overshooting and\nretrenchment. Related, subprime lending with high loan-to-value ratios was profitable\nwhile home prices were rapidly rising, but profitability fell sharply when price trends\nreversed. Lenders who found past subprime mortgage lending profitable in 2004, 2005\nand 2006, may have underestimated the probability of a broad and sustained decline in\nhome prices and how that would affect their lending returns.\nSecond, the regulatory and supervisory framework surrounding U.S. housing finance may\nhave been insufficiently prepared for the possibility of an adverse housing demand shift\nof the magnitude and geographic extent that we have seen. Private sector incentives to\nforesee and protect against such shocks was to some extent dampened by the presence of\nthe federal financial safety net, including the inferred prospect of support for Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac. Official policies aimed at increasing home-ownership also provided at\nleast some positive inducement to risk-taking in housing finance. In addition, the\n\n\funscrupulous and fraudulent practices of some mortgage brokers outside of the banking\nsector may have contributed to the problem.\nThird, monetary policy kept interest rates relatively low after the recession earlier this\ndecade. Some economists have argued, with the benefit of hindsight, that tighter\nmonetary policy during that period would have led to better outcomes by preventing core\ninflation from rising, which would have had the auxiliary effect of limiting the housing\nboom and thus mitigating the subsequent bust.2 While I find this view plausible, again,\nfurther research will be required to substantiate this hypothesis.\nAlthough this episode will, as I said, inspire a great deal of research in the years ahead,\nsome lessons have emerged already and have motivated corrective action, both by market\nparticipants and policymakers. The appetite of banks and investors for nontraditional and\nsubprime mortgages and for the services of independent mortgage brokers has been\nsubstantially reduced, and many mortgage companies have gone out of business. Banks\nand mortgage originators have tightened home mortgage underwriting standards\nsignificantly, reflecting both revised assessments of the profitability of more innovative\nlending approaches and a generally weakening economic outlook. Financial market\ninvestors holding complex mortgage-related securitizations have been suitably chastened.\nThe Federal Reserve has tightened standards over unfair and deceptive mortgage lending\npractices. Supervisory staff have intensified their scrutiny of risk management practices\nrelated to structured finance and off-balance-sheet activities, and have worked to\nstrengthen institutions’ capital and liquidity planning. And the U.S. banking agencies\nhave worked together with nonprofits and mortgage servicers to prevent unnecessary\nforeclosures.\nThat’s all prologue, however, to the turmoil that has plagued financial markets since the\nmiddle of last year, when the potential scale of the home mortgage problem became more\nwidely appreciated. The turmoil intensified the week of September 15, and volatility has\nbeen elevated since. Financial market participants have faced three major categories of\nuncertainty. The first concerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending. For a\ngiven mortgage cohort, it typically takes four years or longer to realize a substantial\nportion of their ultimate cumulative losses. For mortgages made in 2006 and early 2007,\nwe are, at most, two years into that process, and thus significant uncertainty remains\nregarding total losses on those vintages.\nSecond, financial market participants face uncertainty about where the losses will turn up.\nMortgage risks were split up and spread widely, both within the United States and in\nEurope, through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided by credit\nderivative contracts. Moreover, the performance of different mortgage pools can depend\ncritically on subtle differences in the practices of the originating institution and the\nservicer. As a result, assessing the value of any given mortgage portfolio is a costly\nenterprise right now. Financial market participants are thus understandably apprehensive\nabout whether a particular counterparty’s mortgage-related losses will erode their capital\nbuffer enough to threaten their viability. This has led to elevated risk premia in interbank\ncredit markets for institutions with at least some presumed mortgage-related exposure.\n\n2\n\n\fThese premia appear to vary significantly across institutions, however, suggesting a fair\namount of public knowledge of institutions’ relative exposures and capital positions.\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector\nintervention.3 The disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile\norganizations this year may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast\nwhether and in what form official support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty.\nShifts in expectations regarding official intervention may have added volatility to\nfinancial asset markets that already were roiled by an increasingly uncertain growth\noutlook.\nThe striking feature of central bank lending during the recent turmoil is the extent to\nwhich it has extended well beyond the boundaries that previously were understood to\nconstrain such lending, both in the range of institutions and the contractual terms on\nwhich credit has been provided. Intervention has been driven by a desire to prevent\ndamaging disruptions to financial markets, and thus reduce the overall costs of the\nturmoil. While this objective is clearly understandable, central bank lending can create\nthe expectation that similar support will be forthcoming when market disruptions occur in\nthe future. Such expectations can themselves be very costly, because they can distort the\nincentives faced by, and as a result, the choices made by private-sector participants.\nThe critical policy question of our time is where to establish the boundaries around the\npublic sector safety net provided to financial market participants, now that the old\nboundaries are gone. In doing so, the prime directive should be that the extent of\nregulatory and supervisory oversight should be commensurate with the extent of access to\ncentral bank credit in order to contain moral hazard effectively. The dramatic recent\nexpansion in Federal Reserve lending, and government support more broadly, has\nextended public sector support beyond existing supervisory reach, and thus could\ndestabilize the financial system, absent corrective action. Restoring consistency between\nthe scope of government support and the scope of government supervision is essential to\na healthy and sustainable financial system. One option is simply to adapt our regulatory\nand supervisory regime to the new wider implied reach of government lending support.\nThis strikes me as an unattractive option, if for no other reason than the current\nuncertainty about the outer bounds of that support. Constraining moral hazard in such a\nregime would be an immense and daunting task. I take it as given, therefore, that the\nscope of financial safety net ultimately must be rolled back.\nAssessing the effects of financial market turmoil on real economic spending is not as\nstraightforward as it might seem. One popular notion is that the credit market disruptions\nwe’ve seen over the last year or so impede the financial sector’s ability and willingness to\nextend credit to households and business firms, thereby creating an additional drag on\nspending. The widely observed correlations between economic activity and measures of\nbank credit extension lend support to this theory. But causation can flow in the opposite\ndirection as well. When overall economic activity seems poised to contract, the outlook\nfor household income and business revenues deteriorates as well, and such borrowers\nbecome less creditworthy, all else constant. My reading of the history of U.S. business\n\n3\n\n\fcycles is that the direct effect of credit markets on real activity – the so-called “credit\nchannel” – accounts for only a small part of the variation in output over the typical cycle.\nAnd my reading of current conditions is that bank lending is constrained more now by the\nsupply of creditworthy borrowers than by the supply of bank capital.\nThe decline in U.S. housing activity since early 2006 has affected not only credit markets\n– it has had a significant impact on broader economic activity as well. Residential fixed\ninvestment subtracted nearly a percentage point from GDP growth in 2006 and 2007. For\na time, the weakness was isolated in the housing market, as the rest of the economy\ncontinued to expand at a relatively healthy rate. But late last year, consumer spending\nbegan to slow. Household net worth has declined as home prices have fallen virtually\nnationwide over the last year-and-a-half, and, more recently, equity prices have slumped.\nIncreases in energy prices up through the middle of this year took a substantial bite out of\nreal incomes. Moreover, payroll employment peaked last December, and has since shed\n1.2 million jobs. As the labor market has weakened, wage growth has tapered off a bit.\nExcept for the temporary bulge due to the stimulus payments earlier this year, real\npersonal income has steadily decelerated, and is now below where it was a year ago.\nGiven this catalog of adverse developments for U.S. households, it should be no surprise\nthat consumer spending was sluggish in the first half of the year and has fallen\nsignificantly in recent months.\nThis adjustment in consumer behavior has been most pronounced in the auto market. One\nexpects slowing real income growth to lead many households to postpone large durable\ngood commitments, but on top of that, the oil price shock led consumers to shun less fuelefficient vehicles. As a result, light truck sales have been particularly hard hit, falling 40\npercent this year. The recent tumble in oil prices is bringing retail gasoline prices down\nrapidly, however, and normally one might expect this to reverse the shift toward vehicles\nwith lower fuel consumption. But the heightened volatility in energy prices and the\nadverse near-term outlook for household income may be making buyers quite cautious\nright now. And, as if that weren’t enough, the adverse economic environment has made\nlenders less willing to supply credit to auto dealers and consumers on the same terms as\nbefore.\nBecause households tend to base their consumption plans on their income prospects, any\nimprovement in consumer spending growth likely will depend on a shift to a more\noptimistic assessment of those prospects. Once households are convinced that an end to\nthe deterioration in labor market conditions and the fall in equity and home prices is in\nview, however, consumer spending growth will be based on improving longer-run\nincome prospects and is likely to pickup substantially. It’s too soon to tell just when that\nshift will occur, however.\nThe evolution of housing market conditions also will be critical to the resolution of\nuncertainty in financial markets. Housing starts have fallen by two-thirds since 2006 and\nare now running below the rate needed to keep up with population growth. Thus, from\nhere the market is capable of coming into balance over time even without a significant\nfurther decline in starts. And my sense is that we are beginning to see indications that the\n\n4\n\n\fdrag from housing may lessen some time next year. Existing home sales have risen, on\nbalance, over the last two months, and the inventory of unsold new homes has fallen 31\npercent since its peak in mid-2006. I should emphasize that such signs are as yet quite\ntentative; inventories of unsold, vacant homes are still large in many areas of the country,\nand, as a result, average home prices still are declining at a steady pace. Having said that,\nI find it hard to believe new home construction has too much farther to fall. That would\nimply that residential investment will be falling on a much more gentle trajectory next\nyear and thus will exert less of a drag on GDP.\nAnother major question for the economic outlook is business capital investment. Business\nspending on equipment and software fell at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the first half\nof 2008, and the near-term outlook is not favorable. Many firms are facing dimmer sales\nprospects, higher funding costs, and more restrictive borrowing terms. Enterprises that\nare reducing their labor inputs are likely to want to reduce their capital inputs as well.\nThus, further softening in this segment of business investment appears quite likely.\nThe other segment of business fixed investment, spending on new structures, has been\nbooming recently. In 2007 and the first half of 2008, real nonresidential fixed investment\ngrew at a 14 percent annual rate. That category seems to have topped out over the\nsummer, and is certain to decline in coming months. These structures often take a long\ntime to build, and many projects that were boosting spending early this year were\ninitiated well before the turmoil in financial markets began last year. The flow of new\nprojects has diminished considerably, however, and it is clear that nonresidential\ninvestment will slow considerably over the next year, with only the magnitude of slowing\nremaining uncertain.\nForeign trade has been an important contributor to U.S. growth recently. Net exports\nadded over a half percentage point to real GDP growth last year, and 1.8 percentage\npoints for the first half of 2008. Unfortunately, the trade contribution to U.S. growth is\nlikely to decline in the near term in response to diminishing world growth prospects and\nthe recent strength in the dollar. Accordingly, we can’t count on the foreign sector to\noffset weak domestic demand for goods and services.\nLooking ahead, many analysts expect the U.S. economy to regain positive momentum\nsometime in 2009. That strikes me as a reasonable expectation, for several reasons. First,\nmonetary policy is now quite stimulative. The federal funds target rate is 1 percent, below\nthe expected rate of inflation. Second, the major shocks that dampened economic activity\nthis past year have subsided already or are in the process of doing so. Energy prices,\nthankfully, have reversed most of the earlier run-up; that will free up a portion of\nconsumer budgets for spending on other goods and services. And as I’ve mentioned, the\ndrag from housing seems likely to lessen in the next year, and in fact, I would be\nsurprised if we don’t see a bottom in housing construction around the middle of 2009.\nThis is the third straight year, however, that I’ve been expecting a bottom in the housing\nmarket in the middle of next year, so my outlook is tempered by more than the usual\namount of humility.\n\n5\n\n\fWhile the downturn in real economic activity is going to pose challenges for monetary\npolicy in the period ahead, it’s essential that we not let inflation drift from view. In 2006,\nthe price index for personal consumption expenditure (in short, the PCE price index) rose\nan unwelcome 2.3 percent, above the 1.5 percent rate I would like to see over time. Last\nyear inflation was much worse, with the PCE price index rising 3.5 percent. And so far\nthis year, that index has risen at a 4.0 percent annual rate. Much of that acceleration\nreflects energy prices, and with oil prices down it would be reasonable to expect overall\ninflation to subside with a lag. And indeed we have seen more contained inflation\nnumbers for August, September and October.\nMany economists are forecasting a decline in core inflation as well in the months ahead,\non the grounds that widening economic slack is generally associated with declining price\npressures. While this correlation is detectable in many datasets, I would be cautious about\nrelying on it as a causal relationship.4 In particular, this relationship can shift over time as\nexpectations about the conduct of monetary policy evolve. Those expectations will be\ninfluenced importantly by the measure of monetary stimulus provided during the\ndownturn and how long that stimulus remains in place. It may seem premature to be\nworrying about how inflation behaves after the recession is over, but we need to be sure\nour policy remains consistent with a strategy that does not allow inflation to ratchet up\nover the business cycle. As the recovery begins, the path of least resistance is often to\nhold the policy rate at a low level until it is completely clear that recuperation is\ncomplete. The risk associated with that path is that inflation may not moderate obediently\nduring the downturn, and may firm with the ensuing recovery. It is crucial that we not\nallow expectations of future inflation to creep higher during this recession.\nAs I said at the outset, these are not the best of economic times. We have weathered\neconomic downturns before, however, both nationally and globally. And there is no sign\nthat the fundamental creative process that drives innovation and improves well-being\nover time has been mortally wounded. What sets this episode apart is the nature of the\nturmoil plaguing the financial sector, and the array of unprecedented government lending\nprograms. While navigating the slowdown in real economic growth is a challenge, the\nlarger and more significant challenge will be to re-establish the boundaries around central\nbank lending and public sector support and accordingly reconstruct the relationship\nbetween the public sector and financial markets. How well this challenge is met will\ndetermine the extent to which innovation, despite the associated volatility, will continue\nto contribute to the effectiveness of our financial system and to overall economic growth.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this address.

            "content": "What Lessons Can We Learn From the Boom and Turmoil?\nCato Institute 26th Annual Monetary Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 19, 2008\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nThe theme of this conference – “Lessons Learned from the Subprime Crisis” – appears to\nbe a timely one, but there have been several times during the past year when I thought it\nwas a good time to initiate projects to identify “lessons learned,” only to discover that the\n“crisis” was not yet over. 1 I sincerely hope that this conference does turn out to be timely,\nin the sense that we truly are past the peak of the current turmoil.\nThis episode undoubtedly will inspire a great deal of research in the years ahead, and it\nmay take some time before anything like a professional consensus emerges on causes and\nconsequences. After all, it took several decades to document the causes of the Great\nDepression, and recent research continues to provide new perspectives. 2 Nonetheless, I\nbelieve the central questions that are likely to occupy researchers are plainly in view, and\nsome tentative lessons have emerged already. And in any event, legislators are not likely\nto await the fruits of future scholarship.\nI will divide my discussion into two parts, reflecting two distinct time periods – the boom\nin housing and housing finance and the subsequent turmoil in financial markets – and\nthen conclude with some thoughts about what lies ahead. As always, the views I will\nexpress are my own assessments, and are not necessarily shared by others in the Federal\nReserve.\n\nThe Boom in Housing Finance\nThe expansion in mortgage lending that preceded the recent turmoil in financial markets\nis best viewed as a component of the long boom in housing activity that began in the mid1990s and peaked in late 2005 and early 2006. Hard work will be required to estimate the\nquantitative contribution of various causal factors to the rise in subprime mortgage\nlending and the increase in subprime losses. In the meantime, the list of plausible\nsuspects is reasonably clear. First, real per capita income grew more rapidly in the decade\nafter 1995 than in the decade before. Second, real interest rates were relatively low over\nthis period, especially after the recession earlier this decade. Low real interest rates in\npart reflected large capital inflows, but the Federal Open Market Committee kept the\nfederal funds target rate low in 2003, and raised rates only gradually starting in mid-2004.\nSome economists have argued that tighter monetary policy during that period would have\n\n1\n\n\fled to better outcomes by preventing core inflation from rising. While I find this view\nplausible, I believe further research will be required to substantiate this hypothesis.\nThe third contributing factor was the technologically-driven wave of innovation in retail\ncredit delivery that allowed lenders to make finer distinctions between borrowers. This\nlowered borrowing costs for many borrowers and expanded the availability of credit to\nborrowers formerly viewed as unworthy of credit. 3 As in any industry undergoing\nsignificant innovation – credit cards in the 1990s are a good example – natural evolution\ncan involve overshooting and retrenchment.\nFourth, the regulatory and supervisory regime surrounding U.S. housing finance probably\ncontributed to the boom in housing and housing finance. Here, several factors deserve\nmention. Supervisory agencies, like borrowers, lenders and investors, assigned a low\nprobability to the possibility of an adverse housing demand shift of the magnitude and\ngeographic extent that we have seen. Private sector incentives to foresee and protect\nagainst such shocks were to some extent dampened by the presence of the federal\nfinancial safety net, including the inferred prospect of support for Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac. The safety net probably also played a role in banks’ involvement in the\nsecuritization process. Banks’ use of off-balance sheet arrangements and provision of\nback-up lines of credit created state-contingent exposures for the banking system that by\ndesign were most likely to be realized in generally bad states of the world, when the\nsafety-net protection of the formal banking sector would be most valuable. Official\npolicies aimed at increasing home-ownership also provided at least some positive\ninducement to risk-taking in housing finance. In addition, the unscrupulous and\nfraudulent practices of some mortgage brokers outside of the banking sector may have\ncontributed to the problem.\nAlthough the housing boom will, as I said, inspire a great deal of research in the years\nahead, some lessons have emerged already and have motivated corrective action, both by\nmarket participants and policymakers. The appetite of banks and investors for\nnontraditional and subprime mortgages and for the services of independent mortgage\nbrokers has been reduced substantially, and many mortgage companies have gone out of\nbusiness. Banks and mortgage originators have tightened home mortgage underwriting\nstandards significantly, reflecting both revised assessments of the profitability of more\ninnovative lending approaches and a generally weakening economic outlook. Financial\nmarket investors that held mortgage-backed securities have been penalized heavily, and\nhave reassessed a range of complex securitization products. The Federal Reserve has\ntightened standards over unfair and deceptive mortgage lending practices. Supervisory\nstaff have intensified their scrutiny of risk management practices related to structured\nfinance and off-balance-sheet activities, and have worked to strengthen institutions’\ncapital and liquidity planning. And the U.S. banking agencies have worked together with\nnonprofits and mortgage servicers to prevent unnecessary foreclosures. 4\nApart from these relatively focused responses, broader questions have been raised about\nthe extent to which policy should attempt to dampen broad swings in credit or asset\nprices. When a boom in an industry or sector occurs, there is typically uncertainty about\n\n2\n\n\fhow large and how long that expansion will be. Market participants act on the\ninformation and signals provided to them, and this process generally leads to a reasonably\nefficient allocation of goods and services – and capital. But people can make mistakes in\njudging market trends, and sometimes similar mistakes are made by many people at once.\nThis can lead to decisions that many later regret, and, arguably, is what happened during\nthe housing boom. One might argue that it should have been obvious that prices had\nbecome unsustainably high. But borrowers and lenders – and regulators for that matter –\ncould not have been perfectly certain when the market peak was about to be reached. I\nam wary, therefore, of attempting to use regulation to dampen swings in credit or asset\nprices. Such swings are often associated with surges in innovation, so countervailing\nintervention would inevitably risk suppressing the technological progress that has been so\nvaluable over the years in improving consumer well-being.\n\nThe Turmoil in Housing Finance\nIn the middle of 2007, the potential scale of the home mortgage losses became more\nwidely appreciated, and financial markets have been displaying the effects ever since.\nFinancial market participants have faced three major categories of uncertainty. The first\nconcerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending. The housing market has\nyet to bottom and cumulative loss rates still are rising for mortgages made in 2006 and\nearly 2007, so it may be some time before total mortgage lending losses are known.\nSecond, financial market participants face uncertainty about where the losses will turn up.\nMortgage risks were split up and spread widely, both within the United States and\nEurope, and around the world, through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities\nprovided by credit derivative contracts. Financial market participants thus have been\nunderstandably apprehensive about whether a particular counterparty’s mortgage-related\nlosses will erode their capital buffer enough to threaten their viability.\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector\nintervention. 5 The disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile\norganizations this year probably made it more difficult for market participants to forecast\nwhether and in what form official support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty.\nShifts in expectations regarding official intervention may have added volatility to\nfinancial markets that already were roiled by an increasingly uncertain growth outlook. In\nthe absence of clearly understood policy principles governing such actions, markets were\nleft to draw inferences from each successive initiative. Until boundaries around such\ngovernment actions are delineated, markets will be forced to cope with these additional\nuncertainties.\n\nA Digression Regarding Walter Bagehot, the Founding of the Federal Reserve, and\nthe Great Depression\n\n3\n\n\fDiscussions of the role of the central bank as a lender of last resort often appeal to Walter\nBagehot’s classic prescription: “Lend freely at a high rate, on good collateral.” 6 But\nBagehot’s teachings are not directly relevant to modern central bank lending. Lending by\nmodern interest-rate-targeting central banks is by necessity sterilized. By itself, a central\nbank loan increases both the liabilities and assets of the central bank. The additional\nreserves would tend to drive the interest rate below the target, so central banks generally\nsterilize their lending operations via offsetting asset sales. 7 In Bagehot’s time, however,\nunsterilized lending was the only way for the central bank to prevent a spike in interest\nrates by elastically increasing the supply of central bank money when the demand for it\nrose in a crisis. 8 In other words, Bagehot’s dictum was about monetary policy – that is,\nthe size of the central bank’s balance sheet – not credit policy, which alters just the\ncomposition of a central bank’s asset holdings.\nInterest rate spikes were a common feature of the many U.S. financial panics in the late\n19th century, up through the Panic of 1907. The Federal Reserve was founded in 1913 in\norder to respond to panic-induced increases in the demand for money by expanding the\nsupply of money through unsterilized discount window lending, not the sterilized lending\nthat is common today. Today, central banks respond to increases in money demand\nthrough open market purchases, in order to prevent interest rates from rising.\nThe initial phase of the Great Depression, from 1930 through 1933, saw another financial\ncrisis in which large numbers of banks failed. One popular reading of the history of that\ntime is that aggressive lending by the Fed to prevent those failures could have forestalled\nor reduced the severity of the downturn in economic activity. The implied lesson is that\ncentral banks should lend aggressively in a crisis. The Great Depression continues to be\nthe subject of debate, but I think it is important to note that Federal Reserve policy also\nbrought about a sharp sustained contraction in the price level and quite elevated real\ninterest rates. 9 One could argue, therefore, that the correct lesson to draw from 1930-33 is\nthat the Fed failed to follow the Bagehot prescription for (unsterilized) lending – that is,\nthe Fed did not prevent deflation by lowering interest rates and maintaining an adequate\nsupply of money. In other words, the onset of Great Depression was a failure of Federal\nReserve monetary policy – that is, interest rate policy – not a failure of Fed credit policy.\nThis, of course, is the argument of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in their\nMonetary History of the United States. 10\n\nThe Costs and Benefits of Intervention\nThe striking feature of central bank lending during the recent turmoil is the extent to\nwhich it has extended well beyond the boundaries that previously were understood to\nconstrain such lending, both in the range of institutions and the contractual terms on\nwhich credit has been provided. Intervention has been driven by a desire to prevent\ndamaging disruptions to financial markets, and thus reduce the overall costs of the\nturmoil. While this objective is clearly understandable, central bank lending can create\nthe expectation that similar support will be forthcoming when market disruptions occur in\nthe future. Such expectations can themselves be very costly, because they can distort the\n\n4\n\n\fincentives faced by, and as a result, the choices made by private-sector participants. For\nexample, in the past year, expectation of official support may have induced some firms to\ntake the risk of turning down capital infusions or merger offers in hopes of finding better\nterms in the future. Prospective equity investors may have demanded stiffer terms to\ncompensate for the possibility of dilutive government intervention. Clearly, these\ncontemporary examples of the moral hazard effects are detrimental to public policy\nobjectives.\nThe critical policy question of our time is where to establish the boundaries around the\npublic sector safety net provided to financial market participants, now that the old\nboundaries are gone. Such support inevitably distorts the choices of beneficiaries, and\ncostly regulatory and supervisory efforts are required to contain those distortions. A key\ndesign consideration, therefore, concerns the offsetting benefits of official intervention in\ncredit markets. Such intervention typically is justified by a desire to prevent or lessen a\nsevere disruption of the market that might result from the unassisted failure of a large\nfinancial institution. Such disruptions often are described in vivid metaphors, using terms\nlike “frozen,” “clogged,” or “dried up.” But these are just ways of saying that quantities\nare lower, and, by themselves, such adjectives are devoid of analytical content. To\nevaluate the benefits of intervention, we ultimately need to move beyond metaphors and\nlook for clear and coherent descriptions – theories, in other words – of market function\nand market dysfunction. Future research on the current turmoil and future assessments of\ncurrent policy will turn on which theories accord best with the observational evidence.\nThe standard theory of financial markets is based on the notion that markets are a\nreasonably effective mechanism for aggregating dispersed information about asset\nfundamentals, so that changes in observed prices correspond to changes in markets\nparticipants’ beliefs about future payment streams. Under this view, of course, central\nbank or government intervention that raises the price of an asset represents a subsidy to\nthose holding the asset and drives the price away from the asset’s true economic value.\nThe limitations of the standard approach to asset pricing have led to the development of\ntheories built on frictions that cause market prices to deviate from the standard results.\nSome of these theories have the implication that market performance might be improved\nby central bank lending or other official intervention.\nOne commonly cited market malfunction is based on coordination failures that take the\nform of bank runs, especially runs that have the self-fulfilling property that market\nparticipants pull their funds simply because they think that others are doing so. 11 The\npotential for run-like behavior is thought to extend to short-term debt markets as well.\nThe existence of a lender of last resort or other elements of the financial safety net can\nprevent such market breakdowns. But I think future researchers are likely to be critical of\nbank run theories as a motivation for sterilized central bank lending in this particular\nepisode. Runs can also occur as a rational, and sometimes even necessary, response to\nfundamental deterioration in an institution or the assets it holds. My sense of the\naccumulated evidence is that it is hard to find examples of purely self-fulfilling runs –\nthat is, runs not plausibly warranted by changing fundamentals. 12 Not all rapid portfolio\nshifts represent runs that necessitate official intervention. Moreover, financial entities\n\n5\n\n\foften can protect themselves from runs by structuring their borrowing arrangements\nappropriately.\nAnother type of market imperfection is the notion that asset prices can deviate from their\nfundamental values when some participants are forced to sell their holdings rapidly (to\nmeet a margin call for example) and are forced to take whatever price is offered, even a\nprice that commonly is known to be much less than the asset’s true economic value. 13\nThe logic of such “fire sale” prices relies on market segmentation, that is, some\nimpediment that prevents the sale to another investor with both the resources to make a\npurchase and knowledge of the asset’s fundamental value. Throughout this turmoil,\nhowever, it has been widely known that large amounts of money were “sitting on the\nsidelines.” In this age of integrated global financial markets, I find it hard to envision\nsomething – other than those investors’ doubts about the value of these assets – that has\nbeen artificially impeding investors’ entry into the markets for depressed assets.\nA broader motivation for public sector support at times like these is the notion that credit\nmarket disruptions that reduce the banking sector’s capital can impede banks’ ability and\nwillingness to extend credit to households and business firms, thereby creating an\nadditional drag on spending and growth. The widely observed correlations between\neconomic activity and measures of bank credit extension lend support to this theory. But\ncausation can flow in the opposite direction as well. When overall economic activity\nseems poised to contract, the outlook for household income and business revenues\ndeteriorates as well, and such borrowers become less creditworthy, all else constant. My\nreading of the history of U.S. business cycles is that the direct effect of credit markets on\nreal activity – the so-called “credit channel” – accounts for only a small part of the\nvariation in output over the typical cycle. And my reading of current conditions is that\nbank lending is constrained more now by the supply of creditworthy borrowers than by\nthe supply of bank capital.\n\nThe Path Ahead\nAs I said earlier, the critical policy challenge for our time is to re-establish the boundaries\nof central bank lending and public support. In doing so, the prime directive should be that\nthe extent of regulatory and supervisory oversight should be commensurate with the\nextent of access to central bank credit in order to contain moral hazard effectively. The\ndramatic recent expansion in Federal Reserve lending, and government support more\nbroadly, has extended public sector support beyond existing supervisory reach, and thus\ncould destabilize the financial system, absent corrective action. Restoring consistency\nbetween the scope of government support and the scope of government supervision is\nessential to a healthy and sustainable financial system. One option is simply to adapt our\nregulatory and supervisory regime to the new wider implied reach of government lending\nsupport. 14 This strikes me as an unattractive option, if for no other reason than the current\nuncertainty about the outer bounds of that support. Constraining moral hazard in such a\nregime would be an immense and daunting task. I take it as given, therefore, that the\nscope of the financial safety net ultimately must be rolled back.\n\n6\n\n\fThe question then becomes where to establish the boundaries of a combined safety net\nand supervisory regime. The appropriate answer to that question depends in turn on\nfundamental questions surrounding the functioning of financial markets. As my remarks\nsuggest, my reading of the research on financial arrangements has left me generally\nskeptical regarding conjectures of broad financial market dysfunction. This is not because\nI am sanguine about the inherent stability of less-constrained financial markets, but\nbecause it seems reasonable to expect a measure of instability even in reasonably wellfunctioning markets. Accordingly, I would favor narrower rather than broader public\nsector support for the financial system.\nHowever the critical scope question is answered, a crucial constraint on the new regime is\nthat it be time consistent – that is, a commitment not to provide support beyond the new\npolicy boundaries should be credible. My former colleague Marvin Goodfriend and I\nwrote about this problem 10 years ago. 15 We noted that central banks’ implied\nresponsibility for financial stability “can create pressure to expand the scope of central\nbank lending to nonbank financial institutions.” We predicted “a tendency for central\nbanks to overextend lending,” and an increase in the rate of financial distress over time\n“as market participants come to understand the range of the central bank’s actual\n(implicit) commitment to lend.”\nProfessor Goodfriend and I considered several methods by which the central bank might\ncredibly commit to limit lending, and we concluded that there were no effective\nsubstitutes for building a reputation for doing so. We noted that the experience by which\ncentral banks around the world built reputations for maintaining low inflation provided a\nroad map for how to credibly limit lending. Essential to that process is for the central\nbank to, at times, disappoint expectations and refuse to lend, even at the cost of short run\nfinancial market disruption.\nSo perhaps the central lesson from recent events is that establishing new safety-net\nboundaries that are credible and sustainable will be a very difficult task. But finding a\nway of establishing credible boundaries is essential if we wish to maintain a financial\nsystem that includes both institutions that are protected and regulated by the public sector\nand institutions that are regulated primarily through market discipline. I believe this mix\nis important to achieving a balance between the safety that comes from government\ninvolvement and the innovation that, despite the associated volatility, has added much to\nthe effectiveness of our financial system and to overall economic growth.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Aaron Steelman, Ned Prescott and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing these\nremarks.\n2\nMilton Friedman and Anna J.

These interventions can be viewed as responding\nto unanticipated end-of-day increases in the banking system’s net demand for reserve balances. ending for\nextended periods requires offsetting reserve drains in order to maintain the federal funds rate target.

            "content": "Financial Conditions and the Economic Outlook\nGlobal Interdependence Center Conference\nHebrew University of Jerusalem\nJerusalem, Israel\nNovember 3, 2008\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nWe gather during economically trying times, both in the United States and increasingly\naround the globe. In my remarks this morning, I would like to discuss the factors I see\naffecting the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy. As always, I speak only\nfor myself, and not for my Federal Reserve System colleagues.1\nFinancial market conditions loom large in any discussion of the economy these days. The\nheart of the problem of course is the home mortgages made from late 2005 through early\n2007, near the end of long U.S. housing boom that began in 1995. Since the peak in\nactivity in 2005, housing investment has fallen 39 percent. Average housing prices, as\nmeasured by the FHFA repeat sales index, have fallen 6.5 percent since their peak in\nApril 2007. Some markets have experienced more dramatic declines; the home price\nindex for California fell 18 percent, for example. The resulting erosion in home equity for\nmany borrowers has meant that mortgages made near the peak of the boom, especially\nthe subprime and non-traditional categories, are experiencing much larger losses than\nexpected.\nIt will take years of research to untangle the quantitative contribution of various causal\nfactors to the rise in subprime mortgage lending and the increase in subprime losses, so I\nwon’t attempt such an analysis here. But the list of plausible suspects is clear. First,\ntechnological innovation in retail credit delivery allowed lenders to make finer\ndistinctions between borrowers and profitably expand lending to borrowers formerly\nunworthy of credit. As in any industry in the midst of undergoing innovation, such as\ncredit cards in the 1990s for example, natural evolution can involve overshooting and\nretrenchment. Related, subprime lending with high loan-to-value ratios was profitable\nwhile home prices were rapidly rising, but profitability fell sharply when price trends\nreversed. Lenders who found past subprime mortgage lending profitable in 2004, 2005\nand 2006, may have underestimated the probability of a broad and sustained decline in\nhome prices and how that would affect their lending returns.\nSecond, the regulatory and supervisory framework surrounding U.S. housing finance may\nhave been insufficiently prepared for the possibility of an adverse housing demand shift\nof the magnitude and geographic extent that we have seen. Private sector incentives to\nforesee and protect against such shocks was to some extent dampened by the presence of\nthe federal financial safety net, including the inferred prospect of support for Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac. Official policies aimed at increasing home-ownership also provided at\n1\n\n\fleast some positive inducement to risk-taking in housing finance. In addition, the\nunscrupulous and fraudulent practices of some mortgage brokers outside of the banking\nsector may have contributed to the problem. While anecdotes of such incidents abound,\nthis has been a particularly difficult factor to quantify.\nThird, monetary policy kept interest rates relatively low after the recession earlier this\ndecade. The federal funds rate was 1 percent from mid-2003 through mid-2004, and then\nincreased at just ½ percentage point per quarter. Some economists have argued that\ntighter monetary policy during that period would have led to better outcomes by limiting\nthe housing boom and thus mitigating the subsequent bust.2 While I find this view\nplausible, again, further research will be required to substantiate this hypothesis.\nAlthough this episode will, as I said, inspire a great deal of research in the years ahead,\nsome lessons have emerged already and have motivated corrective action, both by market\nparticipants and policymakers. The appetite of banks and investors for nontraditional and\nsubprime mortgages and for the services of independent mortgage brokers has been\nsubstantially reduced, and many mortgage companies have gone out of business. Banks\nand mortgage originators have tightened home mortgage underwriting standards\nsignificantly, reflecting both revised assessments of the profitability of more innovative\nlending approaches and a generally weakening economic outlook. Financial market\ninvestors holding complex mortgage-related securitizations have been suitably chastened.\nThe Federal Reserve has tightened standards over unfair and deceptive mortgage lending\npractices. Supervisory staff have intensified their scrutiny of risk management practices\nrelated to structured finance and off-balance-sheet activities, and have worked to\nstrengthen institutions’ capital and liquidity planning. And the U.S. banking agencies\nhave worked together with nonprofits and mortgage servicers to prevent unnecessary\nforeclosures.\nThat’s all prologue, however, to the turmoil that has plagued financial markets since the\nmiddle of last year when the potential scale of the home mortgage problem became more\nwidely appreciated. The turmoil intensified the week of September 15th, and volatility has\nbeen elevated since. Financial market participants have faced three major categories of\nuncertainty. The first concerns the aggregate amount of losses on mortgage lending. For a\ngiven mortgage cohort, it typically takes four years or longer to realize a substantial\nportion of their ultimate cumulative losses. For mortgages made in 2006 and early 2007,\nwe are, at most, two years into that process, and thus significant uncertainty remains\nregarding total losses on those vintages.\nSecond, financial market participants face uncertainty about where the losses will turn up.\nMortgage risks were split up and spread widely both within the United States and in\nEurope through securitization and use of the insurance capabilities provided by credit\nderivative contracts. Moreover, the performance of different mortgage pools can depend\ncritically on subtle differences in the practices of the originating institution and the\nservicer. As a result, assessing the value of any given mortgage portfolio is a costly\nenterprise right now. Financial market participants are thus understandably apprehensive\nabout whether a particular counterparty’s mortgage-related losses will erode their capital\n\n2\n\n\fbuffer enough to threaten their viability. This has led to elevated risk premia in interbank\ncredit markets for institutions with at least some presumed mortgage-related exposure.\nThese premia appear to vary significantly across institutions, however, suggesting a fair\namount of public knowledge of institutions’ relative exposures and capital positions.\nThird, market participants have at times faced uncertainty about prospective public sector\nintervention.3 The disparate responses to potential failures at several high-profile\norganizations this year may have made it difficult for market participants to forecast\nwhether and in what form official support would be forthcoming for a given counterparty.\nShifts in expectations regarding official intervention may have added volatility to\nfinancial asset markets that were already roiled by an increasingly uncertain growth\noutlook.\nAssessing the effects of financial market turmoil on real economic spending is not as\nstraightforward as it might seem. The conventional wisdom is that the credit market\ndisruptions we’ve seen over the last year or so impede the financial sector’s ability and\nwillingness to extend credit to households and business firms, thereby creating an\nadditional drag on spending. But causation can flow in the opposite direction as well.\nWhen overall economic activity seems poised to contract, the outlook for household\nincome and business revenues deteriorates as well. This implies that individual\nhouseholds and businesses will become less creditworthy, all else constant. So it’s hard to\ndisentangle the effect of lenders’ increased cost of capital from the deterioration in the\neconomic environment facing their borrowers. More broadly, my reading of the history of\nU.S. business cycles is that the direct effect of credit markets on real activity – the socalled “credit channel” – accounts for only a small part of the variation in output over the\ntypical cycle. This judgment may be of limited help in thinking about the rather atypical\nevents we have been experiencing recently, but I think it means we have to give serious\nconsideration to the idea that this episode of credit and financial market turmoil is part of\nthe economy’s natural response to the sharp decline in the underlying fundamentals in\nhousing finance. My sense is that the deterioration of economic conditions is playing a\nmore prominent role in the tightening of credit terms right now than the direct effects of\nfinancial market turbulence.\nThe decline in U.S. housing activity since early 2006 has affected not only credit markets\n– it has had a significant impact on broader economic activity as well. Residential fixed\ninvestment subtracted nearly a percentage point from GDP growth in 2006 and 2007. For\na time, the weakness was isolated in the housing market, as the rest of the economy\ncontinued to expand at a relatively healthy rate. But late last year, consumer spending\nbegan to slow. Household net worth has declined as home prices have fallen virtually\nnationwide over the last year-and-a-half, and, more recently, equity prices have slumped.\nIncreases in energy prices up through the middle of this year took a substantial bite out of\nreal incomes. Moreover, payroll employment peaked last December, and has since shed\n760,000 jobs. As the labor market has weakened, wage growth has tapered off a bit.\nExcept for the temporary bulge due to the stimulus payments earlier this year, real\npersonal income has steadily decelerated, and in August stood barely one-tenth of a\npercent above where it was last September. Given this catalog of adverse developments\n\n3\n\n\ffor U.S. households, it should be no surprise that consumer spending was sluggish in the\nfirst half of the year and has fallen significantly in recent months.\nThis adjustment in consumer behavior has been most pronounced in the auto market. One\nexpects slowing real income growth to lead many households to postpone large durable\ngood commitments, but on top of that, the oil price shock led consumers to shun less fuelefficient vehicles. Manufacturers, however, have capital investments in place to produce\nthese less-fuel-efficient vehicles, and changing the product mix is a lengthy and\nexpensive process. As a result, light truck sales have been particularly hard hit, falling\nalmost 24 percent this year. The recent tumble in oil prices is bringing retail gasoline\nprices down rapidly, however, and normally one might expect this to reverse the shift\ntoward vehicles with lower fuel consumption. But the heightened volatility in energy\nprices and the adverse longer-term outlook for supply and demand may be making buyers\nquite cautious about choosing among automotive technologies right now. And, as if that\nweren’t enough, the adverse economic environment has made lenders less willing to\nsupply credit to auto dealers and consumers on the same terms as before.\nBecause households tend to base their consumption plans on their income prospects, any\nimprovement in consumer spending growth likely will depend on a shift to a more\noptimistic assessment of those prospects. Once households are convinced that an end to\nthe deterioration in labor market conditions and the fall in equity and home prices is in\nview, however, consumer spending growth will be based on improving longer-run\nincome prospects and is likely to pickup substantially.\nThe evolution of housing market conditions also will be critical to the resolution of\nuncertainty in financial markets. Housing starts have fallen 64 percent from their peak in\nearly 2006 to an 817,000 unit annual rate. That’s below the rate needed to keep up with\npopulation growth, and, thus, from here the market is capable of coming into balance\nover time even without a significant further decline in starts. And my sense is that we are\nbeginning to see indications that the drag from housing may lessen some time next year.\nExisting home sales have risen, on balance, over the last two months, and the inventory\nof unsold new homes has fallen 30 percent since its peak in mid-2006. I should\nemphasize that such signs are as yet quite tentative; inventories of unsold, vacant homes\nare still large in many areas of the country, and, as a result, average home prices still are\ndeclining at a steady pace. Having said that, I find it hard to believe new home\nconstruction has too much farther to fall. That would imply that residential investment\nwill be falling on a much more gentle trajectory next year and thus will exert less of a\ndrag on GDP.\nAnother major question for the economic outlook is business capital investment. Business\nspending on equipment and software fell at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the first half\nof 2008, and the near-term outlook is not favorable. Many firms are facing dimmer sales\nprospects, higher funding costs, and more restrictive borrowing terms. Enterprises that\nare reducing their labor inputs are likely to want to reduce their capital inputs as well.\nThus, further softening in this segment of business investment appears quite likely.\n\n4\n\n\fThe other segment of business fixed investment, spending on new structures, has been\nbooming recently. In 2007 and the first half of 2008, real nonresidential fixed investment\ngrew at a 19 percent annual rate. That category seems to have topped out over the\nsummer, and is certain to decline in coming months. These structures often take a long\ntime to build, and many projects that were boosting spending early this year were\ninitiated well before the turmoil in financial markets began last year. The flow of new\nprojects has diminished considerably, however, and it is clear that nonresidential\ninvestment will slow considerably over the next year, with only the magnitude of slowing\nremaining uncertain.\nForeign trade has been an important contributor to U.S. growth recently. Net exports\nadded over a half percentage point to real GDP growth last year, and 1.8 percentage\npoints for the first half of 2008. Unfortunately, the trade contribution to U.S. growth is\nlikely to decline in the near term in response to diminishing world growth prospects and\nthe recent strength in the dollar. Accordingly, we can’t count on the foreign sector to\noffset weak domestic demand for goods and services.\nLooking ahead, many analysts expect the U.S. economy to regain positive momentum\nsometime in 2009. That strikes me as a reasonable expectation, for several reasons. First,\nmonetary policy is now quite stimulative. The federal funds target rate is 1 percent, below\nthe expected rate of inflation. Second, the major shocks that dampened economic activity\nthis past year have already subsided or are in the process of doing so. Energy prices,\nthankfully, have reversed most of the earlier run-up; that will free up a portion of\nconsumer budgets for spending on other goods and services. And as I’ve mentioned, the\ndrag from housing seems likely to lessen in the next year, and in fact, I would be\nsurprised if we don’t see a bottom in housing construction around the middle of 2009.\nThis is the third straight year, however, that I’ve been expecting a bottom in the housing\nmarket in the middle of next year, so my outlook is tempered by more than the usual\namount of humility.\nWhile the downturn in real economic activity is going to pose challenges for monetary\npolicy in the period ahead, it’s essential that we not let inflation drift from view. In 2006,\nthe price index for personal consumption expenditure (in short, the PCE price index) rose\nan unwelcome 2.3 percent, above the 1.5 percent rate I would like to see over time. Last\nyear inflation was much worse, with the PCE price index rising 3.5 percent. And so far\nthis year, that index has risen at a 4.4 percent annual rate. Much of that acceleration\nreflects energy prices, and with oil prices down it would be reasonable to expect overall\ninflation to subside with a lag. So let’s consider the core PCE price index, which omits\nthe volatile food and energy categories. That index rose 2.2 percent in 2006, 2.3 percent\nin 2007, and has risen at a 2.6 percent annual rate so far this year.\nThe sharp decline in oil prices since they peaked this summer has flattened the overall\ninflation rate in August and September. Many economists are forecasting a decline in\ncore inflation as well in the months ahead, on the grounds that widening economic slack\nis generally associated with declining price pressures. While this correlation is detectable\nin many datasets, I would be cautious about relying on it as a causal relationship.4 In\n\n5\n\n\fparticular, this relationship can shift over time as expectations about the conduct of\nmonetary policy evolve. Those expectations will be influenced importantly by the\nmeasure of monetary stimulus provided during the downturn and how long that stimulus\nremains in place. As a recovery begins, the path of least resistance is often to hold the\npolicy rate at a low level until it is completely clear that recuperation is complete. The\nrisk associated with that path is that inflation may not moderate obediently during the\ndownturn, and may firm with the ensuing recovery. It is crucial that we not allow\nexpectations of future inflation to ratchet higher during this recession.\nWith growth falling and inflation elevated, these would seem to qualify as trying times by\nany reasonable standards, even without consideration of the challenges posed by the\nbanking sector. We have weathered economic downturns, inflation pressures, and\nbanking distress before, however, both nationally and globally. And there is no sign that\nthe fundamental creative process that drives innovation and improves well-being over\ntime has been mortally wounded. This episode, however, has given us the opportunity to\ndeepen our understanding of the relationship between financial instability and real\neconomic activity and about the effects of an array of policy responses. What is learned,\nboth by policymakers and the public, can strengthen us by improving our policy, our\ninstitutions, and our financial system. For me, that’s the silver lining.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for assistance in preparing this address.\nJohn B.

            "content": "The Economic Outlook\nNational Economic Club, Washington, D.C.\nJuly 8, 2008\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nIt’s a pleasure to speak to you today. My topic is the current economic situation and the\noutlook for the period ahead. Before we begin, though, let me remind you that the usual\ndisclaimer applies: The views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by any\nof my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1\nThe background for today’s economic situation is the remarkable boom in housing that\nended a couple of years ago. From 1995 to 2005, new housing starts increased by more\nthan 50 percent, and existing home prices increased by more than 150 percent (as\nmeasured by the Case-Shiller repeat sales index), and the homeownership rate increased\nsignificantly, from around 64 percent to 69 percent. Favorable fundamentals contributed\nto the boom; per capita real income grew much more rapidly in the decade after 1995\nthan in the decade before, and real mortgage interest rates were low relative to prior\nperiods, especially after 2002. The inelasticity of the supply of buildable lots generated\nsignificant price increases in many parts of our country. Elsewhere, price appreciation\nwas more modest. Housing demand ultimately became satiated in many major markets,\nhowever, and housing activity peaked in early 2006 in several regions. Since then, new\nhousing starts have fallen by 55 percent, and since mid-2006, home prices have fallen by\n18 percent.\nDevelopments in housing finance arguably have played a substantial role in the behavior\nof housing markets in recent years. Here, I believe the central story is the technologydriven wave of innovation in retail credit delivery that dramatically expanded access to\nmortgage credit over the last decade, just as it expanded access to unsecured consumer\ncredit earlier on. Technology also has contributed to innovation in securitization and\nother forms of intermediation of credit flows, which also helped lower borrowing costs.\nAs with any new product or service innovation, however, some experimentation and risk\nwere involved. In hindsight, it seems clear that the success of new methods of lending to\nriskier borrowers was to some extent dependent on sustained home price appreciation,\nwhich provided strained borrowers with the ability to refinance, thus masking the effects\nof more inclusive underwriting. When housing prices began to fall in many regions,\ndelinquencies and defaults began to rise, particularly among mortgages that were made in\n2006 and 2007. It takes some time, however, for the likely ultimate loss experience of a\nmortgage portfolio to become evident, so it wasn’t until the middle of last year, well after\nhome prices peaked in some major markets, that more quantitative evidence emerged\nregarding the substantial extent to which mortgage loans made in 2006 would\n\n\f-2underperform previous vintages. The ensuing adjustment in underwriting standards\nfurther contributed to the decline in housing demand.\nThe resulting large number of mortgage foreclosures is an urgent problem and it is one\nthat we at the Fed are responding to with direct actions. The Federal Reserve System’s\nHomeownership and Mortgage Initiatives is a multi-pronged effort to understand and\nrespond to this recent rise in foreclosures. First, we are using our extensive expertise in\neconomic research and analysis to increase our understanding of the events. We are\ntracking conditions in mortgage and housing markets and conducting ongoing research to\nfill important gaps in our knowledge. What we learn we are communicating to the public\nthrough a variety of audiences. For example, we are providing community groups with\nanalysis that identifies neighborhoods with high rates of foreclosures, so that they can\nbetter target their home-counseling efforts. We have organized foreclosure forums across\nthe country with the theme, “Recovery, Renewal, and Rebuilding.” We just held the first\none in Atlanta and four more are scheduled through the fall. Furthermore, we also have\nposted interactive maps on the New York Fed’s Web site showing the incidence and\nperformance of subprime mortgages across the country.\nSecond, we are using our extensive footprint across the nation to engage and collaborate\nwith relevant parties, such as community groups, government officials and lenders, to\nhelp them take practical steps to address this problem. We are partnering with\nNeighborworks America by providing analysis and developing tools and training\nprograms for their efforts at stabilizing neighborhoods and dealing with the problem of\nvacant properties. Furthermore, we have hosted and continue to host many meetings and\nworkshops designed to bring together stakeholders who are interested in reducing the\nincidence and effects of foreclosures. In sum, the array of efforts under the Fed’s\nHomeownership and Mortgage Initiatives aims to leverage the Fed’s comparative\nadvantages in research and geographic reach to assist local responses to the mortgage\nforeclosure problem.\nThe story behind the drama in credit markets since last August has been the continuing\nre-assessment of the fundamental value of nonprime mortgages. I think it’s fair to say\nthat a deterioration in the housing market of the magnitude we’ve seen was not assigned\nmuch probability by most borrowers, lenders and investors, even if many observers\nargue, in retrospect, that it should have been foreseen. As losses have accumulated,\ndemand has fallen for financial securities exposed to those assets, as well as a range of\nrelated securities. Many of these securities were the liabilities of entities with explicit or\nimplicit bank lending guarantees. Many banks that provided such guarantees have had to\neither meet large funding demands or bring the impaired assets onto their balance sheets.\nUncertainty about the scale of such adjustments has generally meant higher funding and\ncapital costs, although risk premia have increased far more for some institutions than for\nothers.\nAfter the housing market peaked, the steady fall in home construction became a sizable\ndrag on growth. Last year, the decline in residential investment subtracted about a\npercentage point from real GDP growth, and in the first quarter of this year, it lowered\n\n\f-3growth by more than 1 percentage point. Moreover, swollen inventories of unsold homes\ncontinue to depress prices and new construction. For example, the vacancy rate for\nowner-occupied housing was 2.9 percent in the first quarter, which is the highest value\nrecorded in the 52-year history of that particular data series. Most lenders have eliminated\nmany riskier innovative mortgage products from their line-ups, which makes sense given\nwhat has been learned from the recent performance of such products. But that makes\nhomeownership more costly than it was during the boom and will slow down the housing\nmarket recovery. Thus, most observers are very hesitant about calling a bottom in\nhousing construction, sales or prices, hesitancy that I share. And even if housing market\nactivity does manage to bottom out later this year, it is likely that any recovery would be\nexceedingly slow.\nUntil early this year, the bad news has been limited to housing, but that’s no longer the\ncase. Last year, more than 16 million cars and trucks were sold in this country; in the first\nquarter of 2008, the sales rate fell to 15.3 million units; and in the second quarter, the\nsales rate fell to 14.1 million units. Not surprisingly, motor vehicle assemblies have fallen\n21 percent this year.\nThat’s a stringent dose of bad news. But a couple of other demand components have\nprovided somewhat brighter news of late. First, the demand for exports has been strong\ndue to robust economic activity abroad and the weakness of the dollar in foreign\nexchange markets. Exports added a full percentage point to real GDP growth in 2006 and\n2007 and are likely to make a healthy contribution to growth this year as well.\nWe also have seen surprising indicators of firmness in business investment. At the turn of\nthe year, we began hearing anecdotal reports, both in our District and elsewhere in the\ncountry, of commercial development projects being deferred or cancelled outright. Many\nof us had expected to see a contraction in commercial construction by now, but since the\nbeginning of the year private nonresidential construction has increased by more than 5 ½\npercent. Still, I think it is reasonable to expect at least some slowing later this year.\nCommercial construction projects tend to have a fairly long lead time, and architectural\nbillings have fallen off notably in recent months. Thus, it would not surprise me to see the\npace of commercial construction soften in coming months.\nBusiness spending on equipment and software this year has also been firmer than I had\nanticipated. For example, shipments of non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft,\nhave increased for three straight months, and are now higher than at any point since\nDecember 2000. This category covers a large part of business equipment investment and\nrecent reports indicate that business capital spending is holding up relatively well.\nReal consumer spending slowed at the very end of last year and was sluggish for the first\nfew months of 2008, rising by an annual rate of only 1.1 percent from November through\nApril. The slow growth in consumer spending is understandable, given the restrained\ngrowth we’ve seen in household income. For example, real disposable personal income\nincreased by only 0.5 percent during the first four months of this year. Personal\nconsumption expenditures picked up noticeably in May, but this could well be\n\n\f-4attributable to the disbursement of federal stimulus payments, so it’s difficult to tell\nwhether it represents a fundamental improvement on household spending trends.\nA major reason for the slow growth in household income is the weak state of labor\nmarkets. Job growth was robust in 2006, with payrolls expanding by about 175,000 jobs\nper month. Job growth tailed off in 2007, as the residential construction industry began\nshedding workers. And payrolls have fallen every month so far this year, with an average\nloss of 73,000 jobs per month. Consistent with this picture of a worsening labor market,\nthe unemployment rate has risen from a cyclical low of 4.4 percent in March 2007, to 5.5\npercent this June.\nAnother factor that has dampened real income growth is the large increases we’ve seen in\nfood and energy prices. While forecasting such prices is a challenging endeavor, if they\nfollow the relatively flat trajectory implied by futures prices, then they would no longer\nrestrain the growth in (as opposed to the level of) real income.\nPutting the bad news together with the good, the story that emerges is of an economy that\nis growing at only a tepid pace overall. Over the last two quarters for which we have data\n(that is, the fourth quarter 2007 and the first quarter 2008), real GDP has grown at an\nannual rate of only three-quarters of a percent, which is about one-fourth of our long-run\npotential. Earlier this year, many observers extrapolated this slowdown into an outright\ndecline in economic activity and concluded that the economy was in or about to enter a\nrecession. But the data we’ve seen since then have not yet shown the sharp, widespread\nreversals that define a recession. While the risk of an acute near-term downturn has not\nentirely disappeared, it has diminished substantially.\nLooking ahead, consumer spending is likely to continue to be bolstered by the\ngovernment’s stimulus checks over the next few months, although the extent of the\nspending effect will be hard to gauge. Beyond that, there are legitimate concerns about\nthe outlook for real growth. The timing and size of any decline in commercial\nconstruction activity is uncertain, and could hamper growth in the second half. In\naddition, if we see a pick-up in the pace of the labor market contraction, which so far has\nbeen relatively mild, then consumer incomes and spending are likely to slow and restrain\noverall economic activity going forward. Moreover, the bulk of the stimulus checks will\nhave been distributed soon, and the effects on consumer spending could start wearing off\nin the fourth quarter.\nAt the same time, it pays to not underestimate consumer resilience. People tend to look\nforward and will often take transitory income shocks in stride, even severe ones. This\nwell-grounded principle suggests the possibility that consumers will save most of their\nstimulus checks, as appears to have happened in May, and spread out their spending\nincrease smoothly over time. It also suggests the possibility of renewed consumer\nspending growth if energy prices flatten out, as futures markets predict.\nIt also pays not to underestimate the power of monetary policy. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee has lowered the federal funds rate from 5 ¼ to 2 percent in less than eight\n\n\f-5months. Adjusting for expected inflation brings the current funds rate to well below zero\nin real terms. Thus, we have quite generous monetary stimulus in the pipeline to support\neconomic activity in the months ahead.\nOn the whole, then, I expect growth to be positive, but quite modest for the rest of this\nyear, and to gradually pick up over the course of next year. Although the downside risks\nto growth are by no means negligible, they have diminished significantly to my mind\nsince the beginning of the year.\nWhile the growth outlook has improved since the beginning of the year, the inflation\noutlook has deteriorated. The latest figures confirm that inflation is unacceptably high.\nThe price index for personal consumption expenditure increased 3.1 percent over the 12\nmonths that ended in May, and is up at a 3.9 percent annual rate for the last 3 months. To\nput that in perspective, for several years, I have suggested an inflation target of 1.5\npercent.\nOf course, price increases have been concentrated in the food and energy categories, and\ntaking those out, the conventional PCE core inflation rate has run slightly above 2 percent\nover the last year. Because core inflation has traditionally exhibited a fair amount of\npersistence, last year’s core inflation is often a good forecast of the coming year’s core\ninflation. The conventional approach to forecasting overall inflation is to combine that\nrule-of-thumb for core prices with projections for food and energy price derived from\nfutures prices. Since futures markets have generally implied flat price paths, the result is\nan expectation that overall inflation will decline until it converges with core inflation.\nOne shouldn’t ignore the information embodied in market prices, and I don’t; competitive\ntrading markets are impressively effective mechanisms for weighing and amalgamating\nwidely divergent views. However, the deviations of actual prices from the forecasts\nimplied by energy futures prices have been predominantly on the high side in recent\nyears. While it is entirely possible, as a statistical matter, for this to happen due to chance\nalone, the risk is that elevated rates of increase in overall prices become embedded in\nexpectations.\nWe seem to have dodged this risk so far. Despite several years of elevated inflation, the\npublic’s expectations for future inflation have not become completely untethered as they\nwere in the 1970s. We have several ways of gauging expectations, none of them perfect,\nbut they agree that inflation expectations are higher than I would like but are relatively\nstable. That sense of relatively stable expectations is consistent with the behavior of\nwages. There are no signs yet of a wage-price spiral, in which wages accelerate in a futile\nattempt to stay ahead of accelerating prices. In fact, gains in overall compensation have\nbeen remarkably stable over the last couple of years.\nThe apparent stability of inflation expectations does not justify complacency, however.\nThose expectations depend critically on confidence in how the Fed will tend to react to\nincoming data. Maintaining credibility depends on continuing to conduct policy in a way\n\n\f-6that is consistent with the stability of inflation expectations, and acting forcefully should\nthose expectations erode.\nPart of the rationale for the speed with which the FOMC brought down the funds rate was\nthe risk that the slowdown we are experiencing would prove to be more severe. While\nthat uncertainty has not entirely disappeared, my sense is that such downside risks have\ndiminished appreciably. And just as easing policy aggressively in response to emerging\ndownside risks made sense, withdrawing some of that stimulus as those risks diminish\nmakes eminent sense as well. Moreover, our attention to risks needs to be two-sided, I\nbelieve. As we move through this period of low growth, we need to be attuned to the risk\nthat we emerge from the slowdown with inflation following a higher trend than when we\nwent in. This danger associated with the persistence of elevated inflation warrants an\nadditional measure of vigilance.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb and John Weinberg for help in preparing this speech.\n\n\f",

            "content": "The Economic Outlook\nSpartanburg, South Carolina\nJune 16, 2008\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nIt’s a pleasure to speak to you today. My topic today is the current economic situation\nand the outlook for the period ahead. Motivating an interest in this topic has been\nsomewhat easier than usual in recent months. And the appearance of the word\n“recession” on a popular weekly news magazine only helps. Before we begin, though, let\nme remind you that the usual disclaimer applies: The views I express are my own and are\nnot necessarily shared by any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. 1\nD\n\nThe background for today’s economic situation is the remarkable boom in housing that\nended a couple of years ago. From 1995 to 2005, new housing starts increased by over 50\npercent, and existing home prices increased by over 150 percent (as measured by the\nCase-Shiller repeat sales index). Over that interval, the homeownership rate increased\nsignificantly, from around 64 percent to 69 percent. Eventually, however, prices grew\nmore rapidly than incomes in many major markets, and housing activity peaked in early\n2006 across a range of markets. Since then, new housing starts have fallen by 55 percent,\nand since mid-2006, home prices have fallen by 18 percent.\nA deterioration in the housing market of this magnitude was not assigned much\nprobability by many borrowers, lenders or investors, even if, in retrospect, it appears to\nmany observers that it should have been foreseen. The decline in homeowners’ equity in\nmany regions has led to an increase in delinquencies and defaults, particularly among\nmortgages that were made in 2006 and 2007. As a result, we’ve seen precipitous drops in\nthe prices of many securities backed directly or indirectly by residential mortgage cash\nflows. The ramifications of those falling asset prices led to dramatic events in wholesale\nfinancial markets since last August.\nAfter the housing market peaked, the steady fall in home construction became a sizable\ndrag on growth. Last year, the decline in residential investment subtracted about a\npercentage point from real GDP growth, and in the first quarter of this year, it lowered\ngrowth by 1.2 percentage points. Moreover, swollen inventories of unsold homes\ncontinue to depress prices and new construction. The vacancy rate for owner-occupied\nhousing was 2.9 percent in the first quarter, which is the highest value recorded in the 52year history of that particular data series. Most lenders have eliminated many riskier\ninnovative mortgage products from their line-ups, which makes sense given the recent\nperformance of such products, but which makes homeownership more costly than it was\nduring the boom. Thus, most observers are very hesitant about calling a bottom in\n\n\f-2housing construction, sales or prices. And even if housing market activity does manage to\nbottom out later this year, it is likely that any recovery would be exceedingly slow.\nThe bad news has not been limited to housing. Last year, over 16 million cars and trucks\nwere sold in this country; in the first quarter of 2008, the sales rate fell to 15.3 million\nunits; and in April and May, the sales rate fell to 14.4 million units. Not surprisingly,\nmotor vehicle assemblies have fallen 21 percent this year.\nThat’s a stiff dose of bad news. But a couple of other demand components have provided\nsomewhat brighter news of late. First, the demand for exports has been strong due to\nrobust economic activity abroad and the weakness of the dollar in foreign exchange\nmarkets. Exports added 0.9 percent to real GDP growth in 2006 and 2007 and are likely\nto make a healthy contribution to growth this year as well.\nWe also have seen surprising indicators of firmness in business investment. At the turn of\nthe year, we began hearing anecdotal reports, both in our District and elsewhere in the\ncountry, of commercial development projects being deferred or cancelled outright. Many\nof us had expected to see a contraction in commercial construction by now, but over the\nlast three months, private nonresidential construction has increased by 4 percent. Still, I\nthink it is reasonable to expect some slowing later this year. Much of the reported activity\nin recent months reflects projects that were initiated well before the tightening in\ncommercial real estate lending terms that took place at the end of last year. As these\nprojects move through the pipeline, it is likely that fewer new projects will take their\nplace; indeed, we are seeing some good evidence of this in the recent falloff in\narchitectural billings. Thus, it would not surprise me to see the pace of commercial\nconstruction soften in coming months.\nBusiness spending on equipment and software has also been firmer than I expected. For\nexample, new orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, rose 4 percent in\nApril to their highest level since 2006. This covers a large part of business equipment\ninvestment and is a sign that business capital spending is holding up relatively well. The\nsense I get from our contacts is that most organizations have a large menu of options to\nimprove and rationalize their information technology infrastructure and business\nprocesses in valuable ways, and they foresee a continual stream of spending on such\nprojects.\nReal consumer spending, the largest component of demand, has been sluggish – for the\nfirst four months this year, spending rose by only 0.2 percent. The reason for the slow\nconsumer spending growth is no mystery, since income growth has also been restrained.\nFor example, real disposable personal income increased by only 0.5 percent for the first\nfour months of this year. The retail sales report for May did show a noticeable pick-up in\nspending, but this could well be attributable to the disbursement of federal stimulus\npayments, so it’s difficult to tell whether it represents a fundamental improvement on\nhousehold spending trends.\n\n\f-3I mentioned how slowly real household income has grown, and a major reason for that is\nthe weak state of labor markets. Job growth was robust in 2006, with payrolls expanding\nby about 175,000 jobs per month. Job growth tailed off in 2007, as the residential\nconstruction industry began shedding workers. And payrolls have fallen every month so\nfar this year, with an average loss of 65,000 jobs per month. Consistent with this picture\nof a worsening labor market, the unemployment rate has risen from a cyclical low of 4.4\npercent in March, 2007, to 5.5 percent this May.\nAnother factor that has dampened real income growth is the large increases we’ve seen in\nfood and energy prices. While forecasting such prices is a challenging endeavor, should\nthey follow the relatively flat trajectory implied by futures prices, then they would no\nlonger restrain the growth in (as opposed to the level of) real income.\nTaking the bad news together with the good, the story that emerges is of an economy that\nis growing at only a tepid pace overall. Over the last two quarters, real GDP has grown at\nan annual rate of only three -quarters of a percent, which is about one-fourth of our longrun potential growth rate. Earlier this year, many observers extrapolated this slowdown\ninto an outright decline in economic activity and concluded that the economy was in or\nabout to enter a recession. But the data we’ve seen since then have not yet shown the\nsharp, widespread reversals that define a recession, and thus the odds of a severe\ndownturn appear to have diminished. Nevertheless, growth in output and income while\npositive, clearly has slowed; employment clearly is declining.\nLooking ahead, consumer spending is likely to be bolstered by the government’s stimulus\nchecks over the next few months. Indeed, as I noted earlier, the May retail sales report\nsuggested as much. But beyond that, there are legitimate concerns on the growth outlook.\nMost importantly, if the labor market continue to contract, consumer incomes and\nspending are likely to suffer and restrain overall economic activity going forward. The\ntiming and size of any decline in commercial construction activity is uncertain as well,\nand it could well hamper growth in the second half.\nAt the same time, I have followed the economy closely for much of my professional\ncareer and have learned two important lessons that are relevant today. First, don’t\nunderestimate consumer resilience. People tend to look forward and will often take a\ntemporary shock in stride, even a severe one. And second, don’t underestimate the power\nof monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee has lowered the federal funds\nrate from 5 ¼ to 2 percent in less than eight months, which, in real, inflation-adjusted\nterms, bring it below zero. There is currently a good deal of monetary stimulus in the\npipeline to support activity in the months ahead.\nWhile the growth outlook has improved a bit since the beginning of the year, the same\ncannot be said for the inflation outlook. The latest figures confirm that inflation is\nunacceptably high. The price index for personal consumption expenditure, increased 3.2\npercent over the 12 months that ended in April, and that figure is likely to rise given\nFriday’s CPI report for May. To put that in perspective, for several years, I have\nsuggested an inflation target of 1.5 percent.\n\n\f-4-\n\nOf course, price increases have been concentrated in the food and energy categories, and\ntaking those out, the conventional PCE core inflation rate has been slightly above 2\npercent. Because core inflation has traditionally exhibited a fair amount of persistence,\nlast year’s core inflation is often a good forecast of the coming year’s core inflation. The\nconventional approach is to combine that rule-of-thumb with food and energy price\nprojections derived from futures prices.

The implied forecast misses have been\npredominantly on the high side in recent years, however. The risk for inflation dynamics\nis that elevated rates of increase in overall price level become embedded in expectations.\nWe seem to have dodged this risk so far. Despite several years of elevated inflation, the\npublic’s expectation of future inflation has not become completely adrift as it was in the\n1970s. We have several ways of gauging expectations, none of them perfect, but they\nagree that inflation expectations are higher than I would like but are relatively stable.\nThat sense of relatively stable expectations is consistent with the behavior of wages.\nThere are no signs now of a wage-price spiral, with wages accelerating in a futile attempt\nto stay ahead of accelerating prices.

            "content": "Financial Stability and Central Banks\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar\nEuropean Economics and Financial Centre\nLondon, England\nJune 5, 2008\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nThe financial market events of the last nine months have raised a number of questions\nabout our financial markets and institutions, about financial regulation, and about the\ncentral bank’s role in credit markets.1 Some analyses have focused on the drying up of\ntrading activity in certain structured finance products where the key observation is how\nabruptly liquidity conditions in a financial market can change. Others have focused on the\nunderlying fundamentals of credit quality in these financial products, with a key\nobservation being that, after the fact, it looks as though many decisions regarding the\nextension of credit yielded quite disappointing results.\nThese two perspectives are clearly interrelated, since the loss of liquidity in asset-backed\nand related markets appears to have come about largely because of significant shifts in\npeople’s assessments of the underlying credit quality. Despite this intimate connection,\nemphasis on one or the other tends to lead to very different interpretations of recent\nevents. An emphasis on liquidity is often associated with a view that financial market\ninstability represents a breakdown in the functioning of markets, while an emphasis on\ncredit quality suggests the view that such disruptions are simply the natural way that\nmarkets (even well-functioning markets) adjust to large changes in peoples’ beliefs about\nfundamentals.\nIn my remarks here today, I would like to discuss financial stability and central banking. I\nrealize that a great deal of ink has been spilled on this topic, some of the earliest and most\ninfluential of which was spilled in this very city. But more recently, specifically the last\n30 years, there has been an outpouring of economic research on the stability of banking\ninstitutions. What I have to offer is a discussion of recent financial market turmoil and\npolicy responses from the viewpoint of this body of work.\nIn this line of research, economists have developed detailed, coherent accounts of both of\nthe views I described. These represent competing theories of financial instability, and\nthese different theories have distinct implications for the appropriate responses of\ngovernment and central bank policy to market disruptions. A breakdown of the process\nby which the market distributes liquidity among its participants is often cited as a\njustification for a relatively active approach to central bank lending. On the other hand, a\nmarket adjusting, even quite awkwardly, to a shift in participants’ understanding of the\nunderlying risks might imply that such lending, by interfering with the price discovery\nprocess, is potentially counterproductive.\n\n\fIn some ways the research has been inconclusive – it remains very difficult to determine\nthe underlying causes or nature of financial disruptions in real-time, when policy\nresponses need to be formulated. But this research has improved our ability to think about\ncosts and benefits of policy choices, I think. I will emphasize in particular the importance\nof paying attention to the long-term consequences of central bank actions in financial\nmarkets. As always, the views I express are my own, and not necessarily shared by my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMaturity transformation is a basic function of financial institutions, instruments\nand markets\nThe traditional description of banks and the economic role they play is that they engage\nin “maturity transformation.” Their lending is tailored to meet the needs of their\nborrowers for longer maturity debt to finance purchases or large investment projects and\nto shield them against the risk of losing funding. Their liabilities are tailored to the\ndesires of the ultimate providers of funds for short-term assets to be prepared to meet\nunexpected expenditure needs or investment opportunities.\nIn principle, one could imagine a financial intermediary whose assets and liabilities are\nwell matched in maturity and liquidity. But the nature of the preferences and needs of\nhouseholds and businesses that provide and use funds is such that a deliberate mismatch –\nthat is, a maturity transformation – has historically been more socially useful and thus\nprofitable. Such a mismatch exposes the financial intermediary to obvious risks, however,\nand thus requires compensation in the form of a spread between the returns earned on\nlending and the returns paid to savers. Savers accept a lower return in exchange for\nflexibility in accessing their funds, and borrowers pay more in exchange for the certainty\nof their funding source.\nThis, then, is the traditional view of banking – funding long-term financing needs in a\nway that satisfies savers’ desire for short-term, liquid assets. But this same sort of\ntransformation takes place in a variety of ways today outside of the traditional\n(commercial) banking system. For example, asset-backed commercial paper, which grew\nvery rapidly between 2003 and the first half of 2007, allowed money funds and other\ninvestors to place short-term, liquid funds in securities backed by mortgages and other\nlonger term instruments. More broadly, many structured finance arrangements involve\nmaturity transformation. Repurchase agreements also provide a means for investors to\nmake very short term (overnight) investments backed by longer term securities, as does\nsuch specialized instruments as Auction Rate Securities.\nMaturity transformation raises the possibility that a surge in demands by liability holders\nto “get their money back” could overwhelm an institution’s ability to liquefy the assets in\nits portfolio.2 This is the traditional story of bank runs, and it motivates, in part, the view\nI cited earlier that financial markets are inherently unstable. Since banks’ assets are less\nliquid than their liabilities (their deposits), they could have trouble meeting the demands\nof a large number of depositors to “cash-in” all at once. Knowing this makes depositors\n\n2\n\n\flikely to run if they think such a large cash-in event is looming. So a run, in this view, can\nbecome a self-fulfilling prophecy. This means that a run can occur even if the bank’s\nassets are fundamentally sound, in the sense that if held over a longer horizon the return\nwould be sufficient to repay liability holders in full. The reduction in realized value\nassociated with early and perhaps disorderly liquidation of an intermediary’s assets in\nresponse to such a run is a deadweight cost that presumably could be avoided if the run\ncould be prevented.\n\nFundamental runs versus self-fulfilling prophecies\nEconomists have made great progress in recent years in formalizing the reasoning I just\nsketched, and in understanding precisely what circumstances are required for this\nreasoning to make coherent sense. Researchers have found it useful to distinguish\nbetween what I’ll call “fundamental” and “non-fundamental” runs. Non-fundamental runs\nare of the self-fulfilling variety; if all depositors who do not need their money right away\nbelieve that other such depositors will not withdraw their money, then no run occurs. In\nanother potential equilibrium, the belief that other patient depositors will withdraw\nnonetheless induces all patient depositors to withdraw, thus confirming their beliefs.\nFundamental runs occur when people seek to remove their money from an intermediary\nbecause they have information that makes them mark-down their valuation of the\nintermediary’s assets; waiting is not a reasonable option (that is, not an equilibrium). This\ndistinction is important because the two types of runs have very different policy\nimplications. Preventing a non-fundamental run avoids the cost of unnecessarily early\nasset liquidation, and in some models can rationalize government or central bank\nintervention. In contrast, in the case of runs driven by fundamentals, the liquidation\ninefficiencies are largely unavoidable and government support interferes with market\ndiscipline and distorts market prices.\nThe ability of theoretical models to predict non-fundamental runs appears to be very\nsensitive to the assumptions used in constructing the model. So economic theory does not\nprovide a clear prediction about if and when such runs would be likely to occur.\nHowever, in most instances of runs that we have observed – for example, the wave of\nU.S. bank runs in the Great Depression – careful analysis has shown that banks that\nexperienced runs tended to be in observably worse condition than those that did not.3\nThat is, there usually appears to be some fundamental impetus behind a run.\nRecent events in money markets have been compared to bank runs, even though they\noccurred outside the traditional commercial banking sector. Examples include the flight\nfrom asset-backed commercial paper last summer, the failure of auction rate security\nrefinancings, and the problems faced by Bear Stearns in the week leading up to its\nagreement to be acquired. Can these be characterized as non-fundamental runs?\nCertainly, some ABCP was backed by subprime mortgage debt, for which there was good\nevidence of reduced fundamental value, and there was uncertainty for a time about how\nmuch of any given issue was backed by such debt. Moreover, many ABCP holders were\ncontractually constrained to hold only investment-grade paper, and thus would have had\n\n3\n\n\fto sell if it was downgraded. This, together with the availability to issuers of other\nfunding sources outside of the CP market (albeit at higher rates), seems to offer a\nplausible explanation, based on fundamentals, of the rapid fall in issuance volume that\nbegan last August. Similarly, significant concerns were circulating publicly regarding\nmortgage-related assets on Bear Stearns’ balance sheet, making money market\ncounterparties (short-term investors) reluctant to continue dealing with the firm.\nThe case of auction rate securities appears to be peculiar because the underlying credit\nquality of most issuers – municipalities, for instance – was not called into question.\nInterest rates on auction rate securities are set at periodic auctions, in which security\nholders choose whether to keep their investment in the security by participating in the\nrefinancing auction or to withdraw their funds instead. Auction rate securities thus\nrepresent a maturity transformation in which less liquid assets are funded by more liquid\nliabilities. But ARS contracts also explicitly provide that if there is insufficient interest in\nan auction by either new or existing investors, then the security converts into a long-term\ninstrument, such as a more conventional bond, typically paying a substantially higher rate\nof interest. As a result, the underlying assets need not be liquidated. The consequences of\na run-like departure of investors are thus different than in the case of a bank run or a\nflight from some other money market instruments. This is an important distinction,\nbecause it highlights that the extent to which maturity transformation creates the\npossibility of fragility or instability in financial institutions or markets depends critically\non the contractual terms adopted by the intermediary.\n\nFinancial fragility is endogenous\nThe intuition behind the classic bank run story is that banks are susceptible to runs\nbecause depositors are free, at any time, to claim all of their money on demand. This is a\ncontractual choice, and one that makes some sense given depositors’ demand for short\nduration, liquid savings instruments. But if a bank can restrict its depositors’ ability to\ndemand their funds on the spot in certain circumstances – in the event of heavy demands\nfor withdrawals, for example – then the bank will be less susceptible to a run. And there\nis ample precedent for deposit contracts with such characteristics. In 19th century U.S.\nbanking panics, banks preserved their liquidity, individually, by suspending the\nconvertibility of their deposits into currency.4 They also had recourse to collective actions\nthrough the issuance of loan certificates by clearinghouses in the major cities, which\nallowed the clearinghouse members to meet their interbank obligations and customers to\nmake interbank transfers without drawing on banks’ scarce supplies of currency.5\nThe auction failures in auction rate securities bear a resemblance to 19th century\nsuspensions of convertibility in that liability holders were converted into less liquid\nclaims. One result from the research literature is that such contractual provisions are\ncapable of preventing or limiting self-fulfilling, or non-fundamental runs.6 The prospect\nof suspension discourages liability holders from attempting to withdraw funds unless\ntheir need is genuine, and helps convince them that other liability holders will be\nsimilarly discouraged. Institutions that engage in maturity transformation can also limit\n\n4\n\n\ftheir susceptibility to runs by holding a greater share of their balance sheets in liquid\nassets, or by financing themselves with less liquid liabilities – for instance, by limiting\ntheir leverage or issuing longer-maturity debt. Note that bankruptcy itself constitutes an\nenforced suspension of convertibility.\nThe general principle here is that while maturity transformation can be socially useful, it\nis not inevitable; the extent of maturity transformation and of vulnerability to run-like\nbehavior is a function of the contractual arrangements a financial intermediary\nvoluntarily assumes.\nAny form of self-protection against run-like outcomes is likely to be costly, though.\nHolding more liquid assets limits the gains from the fundamental asset transformation\nthat the institution is engaged in. A policy of suspending convertibility, while making a\nbank less susceptible to non-fundamental runs, could also limit the ability of depositors to\naccess their funds in episodes of fundamentally-driven financial strain, and perhaps at\ntimes when they genuinely need liquidity themselves, thus reducing the inherent value of\nthe deposit contract.\n\nCentral bank lending\nThe usual presumption is that institutions and their counterparties implicitly weigh the\nexpected costs and benefits of alternative contractual arrangements in designing financial\nstructures that best suit their financial needs.7 The incentives of financial intermediaries\nand their counterparties to construct resilient arrangements are also influenced by the\npolicy regime under which their transactions take place. If people anticipate that in\nsituations of financial stress the government or central bank will intervene in a way that\nlimits private losses, then there is likely to be less interest in taking costly steps to avoid\nthose situations.\nBanks have historically benefited from access to support in the form of central bank\ncredit. Discussions of the role of the central bank as a lender of last resort, particularly in\ntimes of financial stress, often cite Walter Bagehot’s account of the Bank of England’s\npractices in the 19th century.8 Bagehot’s advice is often summarized by the simple\nprescription, “lend freely at a high rate, on good collateral.”\nThe relevance of Bagehot’s dictum for recent central bank lending is not at all clear,\nhowever. There is an important distinction to be made between monetary policy\noperations, which vary the total quantity of central bank liabilities, and credit policy,\nwhich alters the composition of the central bank’s assets.9 Modern central banks target an\ninterest rate, which requires that they adjust the quantity of their liabilities – generally\nbank reserves – in response to fluctuations in the demand for those liabilities. By itself, a\ncentral bank loan increases both the liabilities and assets of the central bank. Absent\noffsetting asset sales, the additional reserves would tend to drive the interest rate below\ntarget. Therefore, central bank lending operations are generally “sterilized” via offsetting\n\n5\n\n\fasset sales.10 The lending programs introduced by the Federal Reserve since December\nhave all been sterilized.\nThe lending about which Bagehot wrote was unsterilized; that is, it represented net\nincreases in the liabilities of the Bank of England. Bagehot’s advice was essentially to\nincrease the supply of central bank money when the demand for it rises in a crisis. “Lend\nfreely at a penalty rate” meant to supply reserves elastically to prevent interest rates from\nspiking above the penalty rate in a crisis.11 In short, Bagehot’s dictum was about the size\nof the central bank’s balance sheet, not the composition of its asset holdings. The credit\nrisk thereby taken on by the central bank was a byproduct of the lending required to\nexpand the supply of reserves, not the objective. (Incidentally, interest rate spikes were a\ncommon feature of many U.S. financial panics in the late 19th century, to which the\nformation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 was in part a response. Unsterilized discount\nwindow lending was the method by which the founders envisioned the Fed would\nconduct monetary policy and prevent panics.)\nThere are economic models in which central bank credit policy is capable of ameliorating\nor even preventing non-fundamental runs when they can occur. By lending when other\nmarket participants are unwilling to lend, the central bank can provide the intermediary\nwith resources to forestall costly closure or liquidation of assets. As I argued earlier,\nhowever, instances of run-like behavior since last summer appear to be attributable to real\nfundamental causes, as do the broader financial market stresses. As the likely severity of\nthe slow-down in housing markets and the associated decline in home prices became\napparent, it also became clear that the securities backed by mortgages originated in 2006\nand early 2007 were going to perform significantly worse than had been anticipated. This\nrealization affected any institution or instrument with mortgage-related exposures. When\nthe resulting flight from asset-backed commercial paper caused exposures to come back\non to the balance sheets of banks that had sponsored such programs, uncertainty about\nsome banks’ exposures raised their funding costs, most notably in the term interbank\nmarket, as evidenced by widening LIBOR spreads. Prices of mortgage-backed securities\nwere depressed by the heightened uncertainty about returns, and also by the likelihood\nthat low returns would be correlated with adverse economic outcomes. This uncertainty\nimpeded the use of such securities as collateral for short-term financing. Investment\nbanks that were prominently involved in mortgage-related securities activities were\nparticularly affected.\nThe ideal central bank lending policy would require making clear distinctions between\ndifferent possible sources of bank or financial distress. If an episode of financial\ndisruption is a true liquidity crisis, like a non-fundamental run on the banking system,\nthen aggressive central bank lending can, in theory, stem the crisis and prevent\nunnecessary insolvencies that impose real losses on the economy. Lending when in fact\nthe financial sector is just coping with deteriorating fundamentals, however, distorts\neconomic allocations by artificially supporting the prices of some assets and the liabilities\nof some market participants. Moreover, it is likely to affect the perceptions of market\nparticipants regarding future intervention, and thus alter their incentives and future\nchoices.\n\n6\n\n\fMoral hazard\nMoral hazard is the central problem that the financial safety net necessarily brings with it.\nAnd this problem exists even if central bank lending ensures that the resolution of a\nproblem institution leaves its shareholders with nothing. Market discipline on risk-taking\nby financial firms comes more from the cost of debt finance than from equity holders\n(given the limited liability nature of equity). So it is the potential consequences of central\nbank lending for creditors that raises moral hazard concerns by reducing the cost of debt\nand potentially leading to greater leverage than would otherwise be chosen.\nPeople often think of the moral hazard problem associated with a financial safety net as a\n“due diligence” problem. That is, investors in protected securities or lenders to protected\ninstitutions feel less of a need to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of their\ncounterparties. This is a valid concern, but I think it construes moral hazard too narrowly\nin this setting. My discussion of the choice of leverage points to broader implications of\ncentral bank lending for the contractual structure of financial arrangements, not just on\nthe monitoring of investment portfolios. In particular, the expectation of safety net\nsupport can weaken the incentive of counterparties to build provisions in to their financial\ncontracts that reduce their susceptibility to (non-fundamental) runs. More broadly, an\nintermediary with access to the financial safety net has less incentive to manage their\nliquidity in a way that suitably minimizes the possibility of disorderly resolution of\nsolvency problems.\nRecent work by one of our Richmond Fed economists makes this point very clearly,\nusing the standard model of banking theory.12 He and his New York Fed coauthor\nconsider a setting in which if there is certainty that no government (or central bank)\nassistance will be forthcoming, then the banking contracts developed will include\nprovisions that allow for suspensions of payment and these will prevent non-fundamental\nruns from occurring. On the other hand, if such central bank assistance is possible and a\nnon-fundamental run actually does start, the government will choose to intervene in order\nto alleviate the ex post inefficiency associated with a run. But, knowing that this\nintervention is forthcoming, banks do not self-protect, and thus leave themselves more\nsusceptible to runs. So peoples’ expectations regarding central bank policy choices in\ntimes of stress can affect the very robustness of the system.\nThis strikes me as a deeper form of moral hazard than what people usually have in mind.\nIn times of financial crisis, the understandable central bank imperative is to alleviate the\nstress. But the expectations such actions engender could very well make future crises\nmore likely. The classic time consistency problem is as relevant to central bank credit\npolicy as it is to monetary policy.\n\n7\n\n\fSupervisory authority\nThe economics of central bank lending closely parallel the economics of private line of\ncredit lending.13 Both provide funding on very short notice to entities that need liquidity.\nBoth create moral hazard because they can shift potential losses from short-term to longterm claimants. To contain moral hazard, private line of credit agreements employ an\narray of contractual provisions, such as giving the lender the right to monitor the\nborrower and rescind the commitment if specified loan covenants are no longer satisfied.\nThe contracting parties presumably calibrate loan covenants in a way that balances the\ncosts of intrusiveness against the benefits of improved incentive alignment.\nIn the case of central bank lending, the same purpose can be served by government\nsupervision and regulation of the institutions that are eligible to borrow from the central\nbank. Clearly, the extent of supervisory oversight should be at least commensurate with\nthe extent of access to central bank credit in order to appropriately contain moral hazard.\nThe dramatic recent expansion in Federal Reserve lending raises the possibility that\nmarket participants view future access to Fed credit as having been substantially\nbroadened. For evidence, market participants could point to the fact that entities formerly\nviewed as unlikely to have access to the discount window, such as the primary dealer\nsubsidiaries of investment banks, have now been granted access.\nActions and statement in the period ahead are likely to shape the evolution of market\nparticipants’ perceptions about the extent of the safety net. And these perceptions will\nshape their choices about contractual arrangements and exposure to risk. In my view,\nthere is value in communicating policy intentions clearly. Deliberate imprecision – the\nso-called “constructive ambiguity” approach – leaves it to market participants to draw\ninferences for future policy from our past actions. Without an articulated statement of\nintention regarding lending policy, the time consistency problem is likely to be a difficult\nchallenge because it will be hard to resist the future temptation to mitigate financial\nmarket stresses when they arise.14\nIn establishing new boundaries of central bank lending and adjusting the supervisory\nregime accordingly, a number of considerations are relevant. More expansive boundaries\ncould conceivably prevent more avoidable liquidation costs in the case of nonfundamental runs, but in the case of fundamental runs more distortions would result. In\naddition, supervision itself is a costly endeavor, both in direct resource use and in the\nfallout effects on economic allocations. More broadly, expansion of the government\nfinancial safety net could substantively alter the balance between financial entities that\nare closely regulated and those that are regulated primarily by market discipline.15\nThe crucial constraint, however, is that the articulated policy be time consistent – that is,\na commitment not to lend beyond the new policy boundaries should be credible.\nFinancial market participants are likely to retain some doubt about the exact limits of the\nsafety net; after all, the previous, smaller version of the safety net had fairly wellarticulated limits. The danger is that the effect of recent credit extension on the incentives\nof financial market participants might induce greater risk taking, which in turn could give\n\n8\n\n\frise to more frequent crises, in which case it might be difficult to resist further expanding\nthe scope of central bank lending.\nMy former colleague Marvin Goodfriend and I wrote about this problem 10 years ago.16\nWe drew the parallel to the building of monetary policy credibility after the inflationary\nexperience of the 1970s. We noted that central banks, the Fed included, made many\nstatements about their desire to see inflation come down during the 1970s, but it was not\nuntil strong and costly actions were taken, with broad (though not universal) public\nunderstanding and support, that inflation was broken in the 1980s. If actions speak louder\nthan words in the case of central bank credit policy as well, then the only credible way to\nlimit expectations of future lending is to “incur the risk of short-run disruptions in\nfinancial markets by disappointing expectations and by not lending as freely as before.”17\n\nConclusion\nTo summarize my brief review of the economics of financial stability; there are models in\nwhich runs are self-fulfilling prophesies, are costly, and could be avoided, perhaps\nthrough central bank intervention. Other runs arise from fundamental developments, and\nfor these, central bank intervention interferes with market discipline and distorts market\nprices. My reading of recent financial market events suggests to me that fundamentals\nhave been at work – given the large shortfall in mortgage returns confronting the\nfinancial sector, the resulting strains should not be surprising. But it is almost always\nimpossible to know precisely how much of a market disruption is justified by any\nobserved shift in fundamentals, so determining whether a run is fundamental or selffulfilling is very difficult. With either type of run, though, central bank support can\nweaken the incentive of financial intermediaries to structure their contractual\narrangements to protect against run-like behavior. In the short-term, governments and\ncentral banks may be able to alleviate financial market strains, but such intervention may\naffect financial intermediaries’ choices in a way that makes instances of financial distress\nmore likely. So policymakers face an excruciating dilemma when the potential and more\nimmediate cost of inaction appears greater than the longer term costs of lending\naggressively.\nMuch has been written in recent years about what role central banks play in assuring\nfinancial stability. This is understandable, and appropriate. Certainly, a central bank's\nmacroeconomic policy can have a large impact on the stability of financial markets,\nthrough the control of inflation and inflation expectations. This is perhaps the greatest\ncontribution central banks can make to the overall performance of financial markets.\nBeyond that, the central bank's historical role as a lender of last resort places it squarely\nin the center of financial disruptions as they unfold. We are perhaps not as close to a\nconsensus on the proper conduct of this role as we are with regard to price stability. But\nas we continue to learn about the causes and nature of financial instability, I believe we\nshould strive for policy that is informed by the lessons learned in the achievement of\nprice stability. Chief among those is that a central bank can achieve better outcomes if it\n\n9\n\n\fcan establish credibility for a pattern of behavior consistent with achieving its long-term\ngoals.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg and Huberto Ennis for help in preparing this speech.\nDouglas Diamond and Phillip Dybvig, \"Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance and Liquidity,\" Journal of Political\nEconomy, 91/3 (June 1983), 401-419.\n3\nCharles W.

Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nIt's a pleasure to be with you. While the economy is seldom far from many people’s\nminds, I think it’s fair to say that economic conditions are garnering a bit more attention\nthan usual right now. Housing markets have deteriorated over the last two years and the\nresulting losses on mortgage-related securities contributed to financial market turmoil last\nsummer. The associated decline in employment in the construction and financial\nindustries has contributed to a slowdown in aggregate job growth. Moreover, inflation –\nboth overall and excluding food and energy prices – has picked up of late. As you might\nimagine, these developments have kept us busy at the Federal Reserve. So today, I’d like\nto spend some time talking about the economy. I'll begin by reviewing current economic\nconditions, and then go on to discuss the outlook for the coming year. Before we begin\nthough, let me note that the usual disclaimer applies: the views I express are my own and\nare not necessarily shared by any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee. 1\nClearly, economic activity has been softening. At the end of last year, real GDP grew at a\nmeager 0.6 percent annual rate, and most forecasters are not looking for much better\ngrowth – if any – in the current quarter. Much of this sluggishness has been due to a\nsevere housing market downturn, along with the attendant financial market fallout. After\na 10-year expansion, residential investment peaked in late 2005. Since then, construction\nand sales have fallen fairly sharply, first in large metropolitan areas that had seen the\nstrongest booms, and then spreading to other markets where housing price increases were\nless pronounced. Despite the falloff in construction, inventories of unsold homes rose\nsharply. While inventory levels have actually retreated somewhat in recent months, they\nhave not come down as rapidly as sales, and they are currently a depressing influence on\nhome prices and new construction.\nHome prices increased significantly during the long boom, particularly in local markets\nwith restricted supply. Existing home prices increased about 90 percent between 1995\nand 2005 for the nation as a whole. In the Washington, D.C., market, prices increased\n148 percent from 1995 to 2005 and rose another 11 percent in 2006. And in Charleston,\nW.Va., prices climbed by 39 percent over the same 10-year period and increased by\nanother 2 percent in 2006. Of course, rapid increases in real quality-adjusted prices are\nnot indefinitely sustainable for any asset, and in the case of housing, potential buyers\neventually get priced out of the market. In many markets, prices changed course quickly,\nbut in others, prices have continued to increase. Average prices for the nation as a whole\nfell in the third quarter of 2007 by 0.4 percent, which is the first national price decline\n\n\fsince 1994. And in formerly hot markets, the declines have been larger, with prices\nfalling over 5 percent in San Diego, for example. Prices have also fallen significantly in\nareas with weak regional economies, like Michigan and northern Ohio. Charleston has\navoided an outright decline in prices, although appreciation has remained modest, with\nthird-quarter growth at a 2 percent annual rate.\nDevelopments in housing finance arguably have played a substantial role in the evolving\nconditions in housing markets. Here the long-term story is the technology-driven wave of\ninnovation in retail credit delivery that enhanced the ability of lenders to assess the\ncreditworthiness of individual borrowers. This increased the pool of qualified borrowers\nand the range of feasible financial products, and dramatically expanded access to\nmortgage credit over the last decade, just as it expanded access to unsecured consumer\ncredit earlier on. Technology also has contributed to innovation in securitization and\nother forms of intermediation of credit flows. This spreads risks more widely and leads to\nlower borrowing costs. As with any new product or service innovation, however, some\nexperimentation and risk was involved, and in this case, some of those risks were\nrealized. Looking back, there undoubtedly are many loans that both the borrower and the\nlender wish had not been made. But it is important to keep in mind that many borrowers\nremain better off as a result of recent lending innovations.\nFuture research may quantify the extent to which credit market innovations contributed to\nthe boom in housing market activity by expanding the pool of potential homeowners. In\nany event, when the growth in housing demand came to an end, home prices peaked and\nbegan falling in many markets. In hindsight, it seems clear that the success of new\nmethods of lending to riskier borrowers was to some extent dependent on sustained home\nprice appreciation. This provided strained borrowers with the ability to refinance, thus\nmasking the effects of more inclusive underwriting. It takes some time, however, for the\nultimate loss experience of a mortgage portfolio to become evident. While observers\nwere raising concerns early on – the late Federal Reserve Governor Ned Gramlich, for\nexample 2 – it wasn't until last year, after home prices had peaked in some major markets,\nthat more quantitative evidence began to emerge regarding the substantial extent to which\nmortgage loans made in 2006 and later would underperform previous vintages. The\nensuing adjustment in underwriting standards has further contributed to the decline in\nhousing activity.\nThe story behind last year's unfolding drama in credit markets was the continuing reassessment of the fundamental value of nonprime mortgages in light of incoming data\nimplying significantly higher ultimate losses on recent vintages of subprime mortgages.\nSecuritization was an important part of the expansion of credit in recent years, and\nsecurities backed by pools of sub-prime or other nontraditional mortgages served as the\nbacking for other obligations, usually issued off the balance sheets of the sponsoring\ninstitutions. As housing slowed over the summer, it became clear that some mortgagerelated securities previously judged as relatively safe would suffer substantial losses.\nMany of these securities were the liabilities of entities with explicit or implicit bank\nlending guarantees. Many banks that provided such guarantees have had to either meet\nlarge funding demands or bring the impaired assets onto their balance sheets. Uncertainty\n\n2\n\n\fabout the scale of such adjustments has at times meant higher funding and capital costs,\nalthough risk premia increased far more for some institutions than for others. Since then,\nsuch institutions have taken large write-offs, and many have replenished their capital.\nMany affected banks have dramatically increased their advances from the Federal Home\nLoan Banks, where lending increased by 29 percent or about $180 billion in the third\nquarter.\nCredit markets were hit particularly hard in August, as many participants found it\ndifficult to refinance the asset-backed commercial paper they had issued. Banks began\nholding larger precautionary reserve balances then, putting upward pressure on interbank\nlending rates. The New York Fed injected significantly more reserves than usual via open\nmarket operations in order to relieve the pressure and keep the overnight federal funds\nrate near the target. In addition, the Board of Governors accepted Reserve Bank requests\nto lower the discount rate by a half a percentage point, reducing the spread above the\nfederal funds rate from the traditional 100 basis points down to 50 basis points. With\nconcern mounting that housing investment was declining more rapidly than had been\nexpected and that the growth outlook was deteriorating as a consequence, the FOMC\nreduced the federal funds target rate in September and October, bringing it down 75 basis\npoints to 4.5 percent. Financial market conditions showed some improvement in\nSeptember and October, but turned problematic again in late November, a month that\nalso saw a further deterioration in the real outlook, as measures of housing market\nactivity continued to come in below expectations.\nIn December, wholesale funding markets increasingly showed the effects of heightened\nuncertainty surrounding financial institutions' adjustment requirements. Term funding\nspreads relative to expected overnight rates became quite elevated for some banks,\ndifferentiation in rates across institutions became more pronounced, and the volume of\nterm funding contracted. Increases in interbank interest rates associated with year-end,\nbalance-sheet considerations have occurred in the past, but market participants appeared\nto expect low overnight rates over the year-end this time. Rates at the Federal Home Loan\nBanks are closer to the expected overnight funds rate than to term LIBOR, which may\nexplain the relatively small amount of discount window borrowing even since the August\nreduction in the discount rate spread over the target. All this suggests that term funding\npremia reflected assessments of counterparty risk rather than expectations that the funds\nrate would spike at year end.\nAgainst this back-drop, the Federal Reserve introduced a new mechanism for providing\nterm funding to financial institutions. The Term Auction Facility, or TAF, makes 28-day\nloans of a predetermined total amount at a rate set by auction. These loans are otherwise\nsimilar to discount window loans made by a bank’s regional Reserve Bank against\ncollateral posted with that Reserve Bank. Since these auctions began, near the end of\nDecember, spreads on interbank term loans have fallen significantly and have returned to\nwhere they were last November before the year-end funding difficulties emerged. It will\nbe difficult to determine the extent to which the TAF contributed to this easing of rates in\nthe term funding market, since the counterfactual will never be observed. An earlier\n\n3\n\n\finstance of elevation in term spreads, peaking in early September, abated without such\naction by the Fed.\nAs one would expect, revised assessments of mortgage lending risk have resulted in a\ntightening of credit standards for businesses and consumers. Many lenders are requiring\nlarger down payments, and mortgage rate spreads have increased significantly for riskier\nborrowers and riskier products. Mortgage rates have come down since December,\nhowever – the rate on conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has fallen about 45\nbasis points. And even though the spread between jumbo and conforming mortgages has\nwidened a bit, jumbo rates have also eased in recent weeks, coming down about 20 basis\npoints. Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds have widened over the last month,\nbut still, the level of yields on such debt has fallen. On the other hand, interest rates on\nhigh-yield debt and commercial mortgage-backed securities moved up in the last half of\n2007, and have increased further since the beginning of the year. The strong\ndifferentiation in the response of lending spreads across borrower classes suggests that\nincreasing spreads have been driven mainly by changing risk assessments rather than\nbank funding pressures per se. Higher risk spreads and generally tighter lending terms\nwill tend to restrict spending in the near term. But the fall in short- and long-term\nTreasury rates over the last few months has offset the upward movement in higher\nspreads for a wide range of borrowers. The net effect has been lower rates for all but the\nhighest-risk borrowers. In fact, lower reference rates have meant that more adjustablerate mortgage borrowers will see their interest rate go down rather than up.\nThe economic outlook for 2008 has worsened in response to the developments of the last\nsix months, and the recent flow of data has heightened the downside risks. The housing\nsector has been and will continue to be affected by the tightening we've seen in lending\nstandards. New home sales have fallen 64 percent from their peak in October, 2005.\nHome construction is unlikely to bottom out this year, and I expect housing investment to\ncontinue to be a drag on growth through at least year-end.\nBusiness investment has contributed positively to growth over the last year, but I expect\nit to grow less robustly than in 2007, since some firms are experiencing a higher cost of\ncapital and most firms face an uncertain demand for their products. A particularly\ndramatic change is likely to occur in commercial construction, which is a key segment of\nbusiness investment. Construction spending for new stores and offices grew by a healthy\n10 percent after inflation last year, but we have heard reports from our District contacts of\na significant softening of conditions lately, with major projects being deferred or\ncancelled outright. In addition, vacancy rates for retail space have increased over the last\nyear, which should lead to less construction going forward. The most recent investment\ndata we have are for December, and those reports indicate continued growth in\nconstruction activity and new orders for business equipment.\nExports are likely to remain a source of strength next year, however, as a weaker dollar\nand continuing growth abroad support demand for U.S. goods and services. Accordingly,\nI expect the trade deficit to continue to narrow, providing modest support to real GDP\ngrowth. On the other hand, we are hearing reports of unexpectedly low tax revenues in\n\n4\n\n\fthe state government sector, which will likely mean some pruning of expenditures in\ncoming months.\nThe main story in the forecast, though, remains household spending, which accounts for\n70 percent of GDP. Consumer spending held up well until the end of last year, having\ngrown at a solid 2.2 percent rate in real terms during the three months ending in\nNovember. In December, however, real spending was flat. Higher energy prices and\nfalling home prices are cited often as factors that could dampen consumer spending, and\nthese are legitimate concerns.\nIn addition, we will see more moderate growth in household income in the year ahead\ndue to a weaker labor market. Job growth slowed over the course of 2007, and in January\nemployment was reported to have fallen by 17,000 jobs. The unemployment rate has\nrisen by a half percentage point since March and now stands at 4.9 percent. More\nindustries now show declines, rather than increases, in employment. Fewer small\nbusinesses plan to increase hiring. And in our own surveys of economic activity in the\nFifth District, we are hearing that an increasing number of firms have cut back on hiring\nplans recently. Other indicators are flashing less discouraging signals, however. Layoff\nannouncements have continued to fall through December, and the U.S. Department of\nLabor’s measure of job openings has remained at a relatively high level for over a year.\nMy own expectation is that job growth will be lethargic, at best, for much of this year.\nPutting it all together, we have obviously experienced a significant decline in the growth\nof overall economic activity since August, with much of the decline occurring in the last\ntwo months. My sense is that we will see sluggish growth for at least half a year before a\ngradual firming begins. A legitimate question is whether conditions will weaken further –\nin other words, whether the economy will enter a recession. There are two keys to\nanswering that question. The first is business investment; as I mentioned, there are some\nearly signs are that investment is slowing, but the most recent monthly indicators still\nsuggest some forward momentum. The other key is the jobs market. There is a fair\namount of month-to-month volatility in the employment numbers, so it is quite possible\nthat the underlying trend is stronger than the January reading by itself would suggest. If\njob growth is positive in the months ahead, and if wages can stay ahead of inflation, then\nincome growth should be sufficient to support consumer spending gains and allow us to\nskirt the boundary of recession.\nAs I said, my sense is that the most likely path is sluggish growth in the near term. But I\ncan also see the possibility of a mild recession, similar to the last two we have\nexperienced – in other words, shallow and with a slow recovery. What I don’t expect is a\nmore severe recession, like those we saw in 1982 or 1974. Keep in mind that monetary\npolicy has moved aggressively in recent months, and that inflation-adjusted interest rates\nare now very low by historical standards. That by itself won’t solve all our problems, but\nit will help support activity enough to at least avoid the worst outcomes, and possibly\navoid a recession altogether.\n\n5\n\n\fI would emphasize that this outlook does not incorporate an overly sanguine view of\neither the housing market or financial markets. The swollen inventories of unsold homes\nthat we see in most major markets is a clear reason to project further weakness in new\nhome construction. Until home inventories fall to sustainable levels, I would expect\nfurther declines in home prices and soft demand, and so my overall growth outlook\nincorporates a continued drag from housing this year. Declining home prices will further\nincrease the number of borrowers with negative equity in their home. Since this is a key\ndriver of mortgage defaults and foreclosures, especially for less creditworthy borrowers, I\nexpect continued increases in subprime loss rates.\nSound valuations of mortgage-backed securities already account for higher ultimate loss\nrates as various mortgage vintages age. Those are just projections at this point, and actual\nexperience could come in either better or worse than expected. Unexpected reductions in\nthe values of mortgage-related securities could spark new episodes of financial market\nturmoil. But I believe that financial market participants will find ways to work through\nproblems as the year progresses. Financial intermediaries will continue to re-adjust\nbalance sheets and replenish capital as needed, and will strengthen risk management\npractices as they take on board the lessons of the last year. Investors will continue to\nreallocate portfolios and their heightened desire for transparency will help shape the next\ngeneration of financial innovations.\nRisks are not limited to the outlook for real economic growth. Inflation has stepped up\nrecently. As measured by the 12-month change in the PCE price index, inflation was 3.5\npercent in June 2006. That measure of inflation fell to 1.8 percent in August 2007.\nSimilarly, core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy prices, was 2.5 percent in\nAugust 2006, and then declined to 1.8 percent in August 2007. Those declines were\nheartening, and when the financial market turmoil intensified in August, the improving\ninflation picture allowed even an inflation hawk to endorse an easier monetary policy\nstance. Since then, however, the inflation picture has deteriorated. From August through\nDecember, the overall PCE price index rose at a 4.3 percent annual rate, and the core\nindex rose at a 2.8 percent rate. These numbers do display transitory swings, so I\nwouldn't extrapolate them forward indefinitely. Still, I have to say that I am\nuncomfortable with the inflation picture, and disappointed that the improvement we saw\nearlier this year was not more lasting.\nI am also troubled by the lengthy divergence we've seen between overall and core\ninflation. Some of you may recall that core inflation was devised in the 1970s to filter out\nsome of the more volatile consumer prices and get a better read on inflation trends. For\nseveral decades, core inflation seemed to work well due to the fact that food and energy\nprices had no clear trend relative to the overall price level. In the last few years, though,\noverall inflation has been persistently above core inflation, and few observers expect oil\nprices to go back below $20 per barrel. Because the job of a central banker is to protect\nthe purchasing power of currency, it is overall inflation that we need to keep down, not\njust core inflation. Going forward, markets expect oil prices to back off slightly from\ntheir current level, and I hope they have the direction right this time.\n\n6\n\n\fIn the last few weeks, the Fed has responded to signs of weakening economic growth\nwith further cuts in the federal funds rate, bringing the cumulative reduction to 2 ¼\npercentage points. A slowing economy requires a lower inflation-adjusted interest rate\nbecause it means softer relative demand for resources now compared to the future. In my\nview, the prominence of downside risks means that further easing ultimately may be\nwarranted. My expectation that growth is likely to be sluggish this year figured\nprominently in my thinking about policy last month, however, so if incoming data is not\nweaker than expected over the next several months, it’s not clear further rate cuts would\nbe warranted.\nAnd let me end with one final thought: inflation also presents risks. Throughout the\nperiod since 2005, when inflation rose, eased off, then rose again, longer-term inflation\nexpectations have remained fairly stable. This has been comforting, and makes it easier\nfor me to support interest rate cuts when a weakening outlook calls for it. The longer we\ngo experiencing only upside inflation misses, however, the more we risk losing the\ncredibility we have fought so hard to maintain.\n1\n\nThis is a revised and expanded version of a speech I gave to the Richmond Chapter of the Risk\nManagement Association on January 18, 2008.

            "content": "The Economic Outlook for 2008\nRisk Management Association\nRichmond, Virginia\nJanuary 18, 2008\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nThank you very much, BJ. It's a pleasure to be with you again to discuss the economic\noutlook. 1 I'll begin this morning by discussing current conditions, and then go on to\ndiscuss the outlook for the coming year. Before we begin though, let me note that the\nusual disclaimer applies – the views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared\nby any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nClearly, the severity of the housing market downturn, along with the attendant financial\nmarket fallout, has been the dominant macro-economic development of the past year.\nAfter a 10-year expansion, residential investment peaked in late 2005. Since then,\nconstruction and sales have fallen fairly sharply, first in large metropolitan areas that had\nseen the strongest booms, and then spreading this year to other markets where housing\nprice increases were less pronounced. Despite the falloff in construction, inventories of\nunsold homes rose sharply. While inventory levels have actually retreated somewhat in\nrecent months, they have not come down as rapidly as has the pace of sales, and they are\ncurrently depressing home prices and new construction.\nHome prices increased significantly during the long boom, particularly in local markets\nwith restricted supply. Existing home prices increased about 90 percent between 1995\nand 2005 for the nation as a whole. In the Washington, D.C., market, prices increased\n148 percent from 1995 to 2005 and rose another 11 percent in 2006. Here in Richmond,\nprices climbed by 85 percent over the same 10-year period and increased by another 12\npercent in 2006. Of course, rapid increases in real quality-adjusted prices are not\nindefinitely sustainable for any asset, and in the case of housing, potential buyers\neventually get priced out of the market. In many markets, prices changed course quickly,\nbut in others, prices have continued to increase. Average prices for the nation as a whole\nfell in the third quarter of 2007 by 0.4 percent, which is the first national price decline\nsince 1994. And in formerly hot markets, the declines have been larger, with prices\nfalling over 5 percent in San Diego, for example. Prices also have fallen significantly in\nareas with weak regional economies, like Michigan and northern Ohio. Richmond has\navoided an outright decline in prices, although appreciation has slowed significantly, with\nthird-quarter growth of just less than 1 percent.\nDevelopments in housing finance arguably have played a substantial role in the evolving\nconditions in housing markets. Here the long-term story is the technology-driven wave of\ninnovation in retail credit delivery that dramatically expanded access to mortgage credit\nover the last decade, just as it expanded access to unsecured consumer credit earlier on.\n\n\fTechnology also has contributed to innovation in securitization and other forms of\nintermediation of credit flows, which also helped lower borrowing costs. As with any\nnew product or service innovation, however, some experimentation and risk was\ninvolved, and in this case some of those risks were realized.\nFuture research may quantify the extent to which credit market innovations contributed to\na boom in housing market activity by expanding the pool of potential homeowners. In\nany event, when the growth in housing demand came to an end, home prices peaked and\nbegan falling in many markets. In hindsight, it seems clear that the success of new\nmethods of lending to riskier borrowers was to some extent dependent on sustained home\nprice appreciation, which provided strained borrowers with the ability to refinance, thus\nmasking the effects of more inclusive underwriting. It takes some time, however, for the\nlikely ultimate loss experience of a mortgage portfolio to become evident. While\nobservers were raising concerns early on – the late Federal Reserve Governor Ned\nGramlich, for example 2 – it wasn't until last year, after home prices had peaked in some\nmajor markets, that more quantitative evidence began to emerge regarding the substantial\nextent to which mortgage loans made in 2006 would underperform previous vintages.\nThe ensuing adjustment in underwriting standards further contributed to the decline in\nhousing activity.\nThe story behind last year's unfolding drama in credit markets was the continuing reassessment of the fundamental value of nonprime mortgages in light of incoming data\nimplying significantly higher ultimate losses on recent vintages of subprime mortgages.\nSecuritization was an important part of the expansion of credit in recent years, and\nsecurities backed by pools of sub-prime or other nontraditional mortgages served as the\nbacking for other obligations, usually issued off the balance sheets of the sponsoring\ninstitutions. As housing slowed over the summer, it became clear that some mortgagerelated securities previously judged as relatively safe would suffer substantial losses.\nMany of these securities were the liabilities of entities with explicit or implicit bank\nlending guarantees. Many banks that provided such guarantees have had to either meet\nlarge funding demands or bring the impaired assets onto their balance sheets. Uncertainty\nabout the scale of such adjustments has at times meant higher funding and capital costs,\nalthough risk premia increased far more for some institutions than for others. Since then,\nsuch institutions have taken large write-offs, and many have replenished their capital.\nMany affected banks have dramatically increased their advances from the Federal Home\nLoan Banks, where lending increased by 29 percent or about $180 billion in the third\nquarter.\nCredit markets were hit particularly hard in August, as many participants found it\ndifficult to refinance the asset-backed commercial paper they had issued. Banks began\nholding larger precautionary reserve balances then, putting upward pressure on interbank\nlending rates. The New York Fed injected significantly more reserves than usual via open\nmarket operations in order to relieve the pressure and keep the funds rate near the target.\nIn addition, the Board of Governors accepted Reserve Bank requests to lower the\ndiscount rate by a half a percentage point, reducing the spread above the federal funds\nrate from the traditional 100 basis points down to 50 basis points. With concern mounting\n\n2\n\n\fthat housing investment was declining more rapidly than had been expected and that the\ngrowth outlook was deteriorating as a consequence, the FOMC reduced the federal funds\ntarget rate in September and October, bringing the rate down 75 basis points to 4.5\npercent. Financial market conditions showed some improvement in September and\nOctober, but turned problematic again in November, a month that also saw a further\ndeterioration in the real outlook, as measures of housing market activity continued to\ncome in below expectations.\nIn December, wholesale funding markets increasingly showed the effects of heightened\nuncertainty surrounding financial institutions' adjustment requirements. Term funding\nspreads relative to expected overnight rates became quite elevated for some banks,\ndifferentiation in rates across institutions became more pronounced, and the volume of\nterm funding contracted. Increases in interbank interest rates associated with year-end,\nbalance-sheet considerations have occurred in the past, but market participants appeared\nto expect low overnight rates over the year-end this time. Rates at the Federal Home Loan\nBanks are closer to the expected overnight funds rate than to term LIBOR, which may\nexplain the relatively small amount of discount window borrowing even since the August\nreduction in the discount rate spread over the target. All this suggests that term funding\npremia reflected assessments of counterparty risk rather than expectations that the funds\nrate would spike at year end.\nAgainst this back-drop, the Federal Reserve introduced a new mechanism for providing\nterm funding to financial institutions. The Term Auction Facility, or TAF, makes 28-day\nloans of a predetermined total amount at a rate set by auction. These loans are otherwise\nsimilar to discount window loans made by a bank’s regional Reserve Bank against\ncollateral posted with that Reserve Bank. Since these auctions began, near the end of\nDecember, spreads on interbank term loans have fallen significantly, although they still\nremain elevated by historical standards. It will be difficult to determine the extent to\nwhich the TAF contributed to this easing of rates in the term funding market, since the\ncounterfactual will never be observed. An earlier instance of elevation in term spreads,\npeaking in early September, abated without such action by the Fed.\nAs one would expect, revised assessments of mortgage lending risk have resulted in a\ntightening of credit standards. Many lenders are requiring larger down payments, and\nmortgage rate spreads have increased significantly for riskier borrowers and riskier\nproducts. Mortgage rates have come down since December – the rate on conventional 30year fixed-rate mortgages has fallen about 50 basis points. And even though the spread\nbetween jumbo and conforming mortgages has widened a bit, jumbo rates have also\neased in recent weeks, coming down about 30 basis points. Spreads on investment-grade\ncorporate bonds have widened over the last month, but still, the level of yields on such\ndebt has fallen. On the other hand, interest rates on high-yield debt and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities moved up in the last half of 2007, and have increased further\nsince the beginning of the year. The strong differentiation in the response of lending\nspreads across borrower classes suggests that increasing spreads have been driven mainly\nby changing risk assessments rather than bank funding pressures. Higher risk spreads and\ngenerally tighter lending terms will tend to restrict spending in the near term. But the fall\n\n3\n\n\fin short- and long-term Treasury rates over the last few months has offset the upward\nmovement in higher spreads for a wide range of borrowers. The net effect has been lower\nrates for all but the highest risk borrowers.\nThe economic outlook for 2008 has worsened in response to the developments of the last\nsix months, and the recent flow of data has heightened the downside risks. The housing\nsector has been and will continue to be affected by the tightening we've seen in lending\nstandards. Home construction is unlikely to bottom out this year, and I expect housing\ninvestment to continue to be a drag on growth through at least year-end. Business\ninvestment has contributed positively to growth over the last year, but I expect it to grow\nless robustly than in 2007, since some firms may see a higher cost of capital and some\nfirms may face a decline in the demand for their products. Exports are likely to remain a\nsource of strength next year, however, as a weaker dollar and relatively healthy\neconomies overseas support demand for U.S. goods and services. Accordingly, I expect\nthe trade deficit to continue to narrow, providing modest support to real GDP growth.\nThe main story in the forecast, though, remains household spending, which accounts for\n70 percent of GDP. Consumer spending held up quite well up until the end of last year,\nhaving grown at over 3 percent in real terms during the three months ending in\nNovember. Higher energy prices and falling home prices are cited often as factors that\ncould dampen consumer spending, and these are legitimate concerns. In addition, we\ncould see more moderate growth in household income in the year ahead. Job growth\nslowed somewhat over the course of 2007, and in December employment was reported to\nhave expanded by a meager 18,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate rising by threetenths of a percentage point to 5 percent. Payroll employment is a fairly choppy series\nfrom month to month, however, and over the last three months payrolls grew by 97,000\njobs per month, on average. So while employment has certainly decelerated over the last\n12 months, I continue to expect moderate job growth in 2008. With wage gains outpacing\ninflation now, and thus real incomes continuing to expand, I believe the most likely\nscenario is for reasonably solid income growth next year that will support some gains in\nconsumer spending.\nPutting it all together, I expect growth to be very weak for several more months, but to\nimprove toward the end of this year. Clearly, the most cogent risks to the growth outlook\nare on the downside. With the strains in housing persisting, a substantial slowdown in\nbusiness spending could raise the odds of a recession. This risk would be heightened if\nDecember’s job market weakness proved persistent, pulling down prospects for personal\nincome and household spending. Nevertheless, I believe the most likely outcome is for\ngrowth to continue and to improve. I should note that my baseline outlook does not\ndepend on an overly sanguine view of financial market conditions, which are, after all, a\nsignificant source of uncertainty right now. Much remains to be learned about the\nmagnitude of ultimate losses in various mortgage market segments and on various related\nsecurities. Episodes of turmoil could recur in response to new information. But I believe\nthat financial market participants will find ways to work through problems as the year\nprogresses. Financial intermediaries will re-adjust balance sheets and continue to\n\n4\n\n\freplenish capital as needed, and investors' desire for transparency will help shape the next\ngeneration of financial innovations.\nRisks are not limited to the outlook for real economic growth. Inflation has stepped up\nrecently. As measured by the 12-month change in the PCE price index, inflation was 3.5\npercent ending in June 2006. That measure of inflation fell to 1.8 percent in August 2007.\nSimilarly, core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy prices, was 2.5 percent in\nAugust 2006, and then declined to 1.8 percent in August 2007. Those declines were\nheartening, and when the financial market turmoil intensified in August the improving\ninflation picture allowed even an inflation hawk to endorse an easier monetary policy\nstance. Since then, however, the inflation picture has deteriorated. From August through\nNovember, the overall PCE price index rose at a 4.8 percent annual rate, and the core\nindex rose at a 2.9 percent rate. Judging by the closely related consumer price index, the\nnumbers for December will not be any better. Now these numbers do display transitory\nswings, so I wouldn't extrapolate them forward indefinitely. Still, I have to say that I am\nuncomfortable with the inflation picture, and disappointed that the improvement we saw\nearlier this year was not more lasting.\nI am also troubled by the lengthy divergence we've seen between overall and core\ninflation. Some of you may recall that core inflation was devised in the 1970s to filter out\nsome of the more volatile consumer prices to get a better read on inflation trends. For\nseveral decades, core inflation seemed to work well due to the fact that food and energy\nprices had no clear trend relative to the overall price level.

Because the job of a central banker is to protect\nthe purchasing power of currency, it is overall inflation that we need to keep down, not\njust core inflation. Going forward, markets expect oil prices to back off slightly from\ntheir current level, and I hope they are right this time.\nThe Fed has responded to the slowing economy with a cumulative reduction in the\nfederal funds rate of 100 basis points. A slowing economy requires a lower real interest\nrate because it means softer relative demand for resources now compared to the future.\nAnd the current downside risks mean that further slowing, and thus further easing, is\nquite possible. But inflation also presents risks. Throughout the period since 2005, when\ninflation rose, eased off, then rose again, longer-term inflation expectations have\nremained fairly stable. If energy and food prices continue to push overall inflation above\ncore inflation, then this higher overall trend could work its way into expectations, further\ncomplicating monetary policy in 2008.\n1\n\nThis is a revised and expanded version of a speech I gave to the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce on\nDecember 19, 2007.

Here in Charlotte, prices climbed by 49 percent over the same 10-year period and\nincreased by another 17 percent since then. Of course, rapid increases in real qualityadjusted prices are not indefinitely sustainable for any asset, and in the case of housing,\npotential buyers eventually get priced out of the market. In many markets, prices changed\ncourse quickly, but in others prices have continued to increase. Average prices for the\nnation as a whole fell in the third quarter of 2007 by 0.4 percent, which is the first\nnational price decline since 1994. And in formerly hot markets, the declines have been\nlarger, with prices falling over 5 percent in San Diego, for example. Prices have also\nfallen significantly in areas with weak regional economies, like Michigan and northern\nOhio.\nDevelopments in housing finance arguably have played a substantial role in the behavior\nof housing markets. Here the long-term story is the technology-driven wave of innovation\nin retail credit delivery that dramatically expanded access to mortgage credit over the last\ndecade, just as it expanded access to unsecured consumer credit earlier on. Technology\n\n1\n\n\falso has contributed to innovation in securitization and other forms of intermediation of\ncredit flows, which also helped lower borrowing costs. As with any new product or\nservice innovation, however, some experimentation and risk was involved.\nFuture research may quantify the extent to which credit market innovations contributed to\na boom in housing market activity by expanding the pool of potential homeowners. In\nany event, when the growth in housing demand came to an end, home prices peaked and\nbegan falling in many markets. In hindsight, it seems clear that the success of new\nmethods of lending to riskier borrowers was to some extent dependent on sustained home\nprice appreciation, which provided strained borrowers with the ability to refinance, thus\nmasking the effects of more inclusive underwriting. It takes some time, however, for the\nlikely ultimate loss experience of a mortgage portfolio to become evident. While\nobservers were raising concerns early on – the late Federal Reserve Governor Ned\nGramlich, for example 2 – it wasn’t until this year, after home prices had peaked in some\nmajor markets, that more quantitative evidence began to emerge regarding the substantial\nextent to which mortgage loans made in 2006 would underperform previous vintages.\nThe ensuing adjustment in underwriting standards further contributed to the decline in\nhousing demand.\nThe story behind this year’s unfolding drama in credit markets is the continuing reassessment of the fundamental value of nonprime mortgages. Demand fell for financial\nsecurities exposed to those assets, as well as a range of related securities. Many of these\nsecurities were the liabilities of entities with explicit or implicit bank lending guarantees.\nMany banks that provided such guarantees have had to either meet large funding\ndemands or bring the impaired assets onto their balance sheets. Uncertainty about the\nscale of such adjustments has generally meant higher funding and capital costs, although\nrisk premia have increased far more for some institutions than for others.\nIn the last several weeks wholesale funding markets have increasingly shown the effects\nof heightened uncertainty surrounding financial institutions’ adjustment requirements.\nTerm funding spreads relative to expected overnight rates have become quite elevated for\nsome banks, differentiation in rates across institutions has become more pronounced, and\nthe volume of term funding appears to have contracted. Increases in interbank interest\nrates associated with year-end, balance-sheet considerations have occurred in the past,\nbut market participants appear to expect low overnight rates over the year-end this time.\nThis suggests that term funding premia reflect assessments of counterparty risk rather\nthan expectations that the funds rate may spike.\nCredit terms have tightened for non-financial borrowers as well. Mortgage rate spreads\nhave increased significantly for riskier borrowers and riskier products, and many lenders\nare requiring larger down payments. Spreads for high-yield debt and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities have risen sharply. On the other hand, sound businesses with\nnegligible exposure to housing markets have seen little change in the terms on which they\ncan access credit. The strong differentiation in the response of lending spreads across\nborrower classes suggests that increasing spreads have been driven mainly by changing\nrisk assessments rather than bank funding pressures.\n\n2\n\n\fHow will all this affect the economy going forward? Higher risk spreads and generally\ntighter lending terms will tend to restrict spending in the near term. But short- and longterm Treasury rates have fallen in the last few months, providing a partial offset to higher\nspreads. The net effect is lower rates for low-risk borrowers, but higher rates for riskier\nborrowers.\nThe housing sector has been and will continue to be affected by the tightening we’ve seen\nin lending terms. Home construction and sales are unlikely to bottom out before the\nmiddle of the year, and I expect housing to continue to be a drag on growth well into\n2008. Business investment is likely to continue to grow, but less robustly than in 2007, as\nsome firms face a higher cost of capital and many firms see more uncertainty in the\ndemand for their products. Exports will be a source of strength next year, as a weaker\ndollar and strong economies overseas support demand for U.S. goods and services.\nAccordingly, the trade deficit is likely to continue to narrow, providing a modest boost to\nreal GDP growth.\nThe main story in the forecast, though, remains household spending, which accounts for\n70 percent of GDP. Higher energy prices and falling home prices are cited often as\nfactors that could dampen consumer spending, and these are legitimate concerns. At the\nsame time, though, I have learned not to underestimate the resilience of the American\nconsumer, and here I see some reasonably encouraging signs. Job growth has slowed this\nyear, but even so, payroll employment has expanded by an average of 100,000 jobs per\nmonth over the last three months. Moreover, wage gains are outpacing inflation now, and\nthus real incomes are continuing to expand. I believe the most-likely scenario, therefore,\nis for reasonably solid income growth next year that will support further gains in\nconsumer spending.\nPutting it all together, I expect growth to be very weak for several more months, but to\nimprove as we move through 2008. So if I had to guess – as my host, Henry, insists – I\nwould write down that real GDP growth will be between 2 and 2 ¼ percent from the\nfourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008. This represents a growth rate\nsomewhat below long-run trend. I would agree that the most cogent risks to the growth\noutlook are on the downside – for example, the possibility that household and business\nspending could come in lower than I expect. Nevertheless, I believe the most likely\noutcome is for growth to continue and to improve over the course of next year. My\nbaseline outlook is more benign than some others that I am aware of, but I should note\nthat it does not depend on an overly sanguine view of financial market conditions, which\nare, after all, a significant source of uncertainty right now. Much remains to be learned\nabout the magnitude of ultimate losses in various mortgage market segments and on\nvarious related securities. Episodes of turmoil could recur in response to new\ninformation. But I believe that financial market participants will find ways to work\nthrough problems as the year progresses. Financial intermediaries will re-adjust balance\nsheets and replenish capital as needed, and investors’ desire for transparency will help\nshape the next generation of financial innovations.\n\n3\n\n\fLet me conclude by discussing the inflation picture. As measured by the 12-month\nchange in the PCE price index, inflation was 3.5 percent ending in June 2006. That\nmeasure of inflation fell to 1.8 percent in August 2007. Similarly, core inflation, which\nomits volatile food and energy prices, was 2.5 percent in August 2006, and then declined\nto 1.8 percent in August 2007. Those declines were heartening, and when the financial\nmarket turmoil intensified in August the improving inflation picture allowed even an\ninflation hawk to endorse an easier monetary policy stance. Since August, however, the\ninflation picture has deteriorated. In September and October, the overall PCE price index\nrose at a 3.3 percent annual rate, and the core index rose at a 2.6 percent rate. Judging by\nthe closely related consumer price index, the numbers for November will be even worse.\nNow these numbers do display transitory swings, so I wouldn’t extrapolate them forward\nindefinitely. Still, I have to say that I am uncomfortable with the inflation picture, and\ndisappointed that the improvement we saw earlier this year was not more lasting.\nI am also troubled by the lengthy divergence we’ve seen between overall and core\ninflation. Some of you may recall that core inflation was devised in the 1970s to filter out\nsome of the more volatile consumer prices to get a better read on inflation trends. For\nseveral decades, core inflation seemed to work well due to the fact that food and energy\nprices had no clear trend relative to the overall price level. In the last few years, though,\noverall inflation has been persistently above core inflation, and few observers expect oil\nprices to go back below $20 per barrel. Because the job of a central banker is to protect\nthe purchasing power of currency, it is overall inflation that we need to keep down, not\njust core inflation. Going forward, markets expect oil prices to back off slightly from\ntheir current level, and I hope they are right. If energy prices fail to decline, monetary\npolicy decisions will be that much more difficult in 2008.\n1\n\nI am grateful to Roy Webb for help in preparing this speech.\nEdward M.

            "content": "The Role of Central Banks in Credit Markets\nInternational Association of Credit Portfolio Managers\nNew York, New York\nNovember 7, 2007\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nBy now I’m sure the events of this past summer are very familiar to most financial\nmarket professionals. 1 Since these events form the backdrop for my discussion of the\ncentral bank’s role in credit markets, I will begin with a quick review. As the housing\ndownturn that began early in 2006 deepened, delinquencies, defaults, and loss rates rose\non high-risk mortgages, particularly more recent vintages. In response to unfolding\nevents – including rating agency downgrades and losses and insolvencies at various\nintermediaries – participants in markets for instruments with mortgage debt exposure\nrevised downward their assessments of the likely future returns on the underlying assets.\nAt times investors had difficulty discerning the magnitude of their counterparty’s\nvulnerability and thus distinguishing among various instruments. This became\nparticularly acute in early August following a suspension of fund redemptions by a large\nEuropean intermediary, and for several days thereafter many markets were roiled as\ninvestors appeared to pull back from a broad range of asset classes.\nAs market participants sorted out the implications of these developments, concerns\ncentered on the segment of the asset-backed commercial paper market with exposure to\nhigh-risk mortgage debt. Revised risk assessments gave rise to large portfolio shifts\namong money market mutual funds and Treasury bill markets, and significantly reduced\nmany investors’ willingness to pay for mortgage-backed securities and related assetbacked commercial paper. Many ABCP issuers were unable to refinance their positions\non terms as advantageous as before. As a result, many banks that sponsored or provided\nback-up support to commercial paper conduits have faced large potential funding draws\nand the possibility of substantial hits if poorly performing assets come onto their balance\nsheets. Revised risk reassessments also affected markets for other structured finance\nproducts.\nThe substantial shift in some banks’ funding outlooks has had tactical implications for\ntheir participation in the interbank money market and has led to increased rate volatility\nand heightened term lending spreads. In response, the Fed has acted to help ensure the\nsmooth operation of the federal funds market. On August 10, a day of notable volatility,\nthe New York Fed’s open market desk engaged in larger than usual operations,\nintervening on multiple occasions and adding $38 billion that day, the largest amount\nsince the days following September 11, 2001. Unusually high volatility in the federal\nfunds market persisted, however, which complicated the desk’s operations in the days\nthereafter. On August 17, the Fed reduced the discount rate, the rate on our collateralized\nloans to banks, cutting the spread between the lending rate and the federal funds target\n\n1\n\n\frate in half from its typical 100 basis points. We usually look to the discount rate to\nprovide a cap on the cost of overnight funds for sound institutions, so reducing the cap\nhelped limit funds rate volatility. In addition, the Fed’s August 17 action provided for\nterm lending (up to 30 days) through the discount window, motivated by the elevated\nlevel of term premiums.\nAt times of market tumult, people look to the central bank to assure financial stability.\nBut sometimes there is uncertainty about what actions, if any, the central bank can or will\ntake in response to market events, and there are legitimate differences of opinion about\nthe appropriateness of alternative responses. While several central banks were visibly\nadding unusual quantities of reserves this summer, the Bank of England stood out in its\nresistance to taking drastic actions in providing extraordinary credit to banks\nexperiencing difficulties. Even there, however, the central bank did act when a large\nmortgage lender, Northern Rock, experienced a run by its depositors.\nUsing this summer’s events as a test case, I’d like to discuss the role of the central bank\nin credit markets. In doing so, I’ll suggest that central banks face a fundamental dilemma.\nThe provision of central bank credit, for instance through the discount window, is\ntypically understood as one of the means by which a central bank provides the financial\nsystem with liquidity, in this case meaning central bank account balances. One rationale\nfor central bank credit provision is the notion that, absent sufficient liquidity, financial\nassets may trade at prices below their fundamental values. The dilemma is that when we\nsee assets trading at prices that seem below normal, or when we see the volume of trading\nactivity fall below what we think of as normal levels, we can almost never be sure\nwhether these shortfalls reflect a shortage of liquidity or simply a re-evaluation of\nfundamental values by market participants. And these two different interpretations have\nvery different implications for the appropriateness of central bank actions.\nAs I examine this dilemma, I’ll take what might seem like a detour by talking about this\nyear’s Nobel Prize in economics, which was awarded to Leo Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, and\nRoger Meyerson for contributions to something called “mechanism design theory.” 2\nGiven the way the press covered the award, this might seem like an abstruse subject, at\nbest remotely connected to my main topic for today. But they are quite intimately\nconnected because this field of economics really supplies the best tools we have for\nthinking coherently about financial institutions, financial innovation, and the incentives\ncreated by the complex and ever-changing array of financial contracts available to\ninvestors, businesses, and consumers. In fact, mechanism design is the theoretical\nfoundation of the work of credit risk specialists like yourselves as you analyze the\nfeatures of modern credit-related contracts. You might say that mechanism design is\nwhere one would find the tools to build a formal theory of what you actually do.\nAt its core, mechanism design is about determining what kind of contractual\narrangements will work best in the situations that market participants might find\nthemselves in. While these tools may not always provide definitive answers to important\nquestions, they do provide a way of thinking systematically about the right questions. As\nI’ll discuss, this seemingly arcane body of knowledge has important implications for how\n\n2\n\n\fto think about the dilemmas associated with the role of the central bank in credit markets,\nparticularly during periods of market turmoil. This is when central banks are forced to\nmake judgments about what impediments, if any, are interfering with the normal\noperation of credit market mechanisms, and how policy actions might or might not be\ncapable of overcoming those impediments.\n\nFinancial Markets, Intermediaries and Innovation\nFinancial markets, instruments, and institutions play an essential role in the allocation of\nresources in a modern economy. By channeling funds from ultimate savers to ultimate\nborrowers, they facilitate the movement of resources to their highest-valued uses – from\nhouseholds and firms with relatively low demand for current resources (consumption or\ninvestment today) to households and firms whose present needs and wants are more\npressing. At the same time, the financial system allocates the ultimate returns on those\ninvestments among the savers who contributed to them. Some savers may seek safe\nreturns, while others may tolerate more risk. Hence, the allocation of returns serves to\nallocate the risks associated with investing resources.\nThe simple textbook model of the funds-channeling function envisions a supply curve\nrepresenting the availability of funds from savers at different interest rates, and a demand\ncurve representing people’s willingness to borrow. The market-clearing interest rate is the\none that equates the two. But this description assumes that financing flows directly from\nthose firms and households that are savers to those that are borrowers. While this might\nbe a reasonable abstraction for some types of financial transactions – such as the issuance\nof corporate bonds or equities – for others (and even for corporate obligations), the\nallocation of financial resources is facilitated by one or more types of intermediaries. The\nsimple textbook approach is poorly equipped to handle questions about the structure of\nintermediaries or the source of their comparative advantage.\nWe usually think of intermediaries as solving problems associated with limited\ninformation – savers may have neither the ability nor the inclination to make granular\ndistinctions regarding the credit risk associated with the widely varying borrowers\nseeking funds. So they place their funds with intermediaries – banks or investment funds\n– to whom they essentially delegate the responsibility for evaluating and monitoring\nborrowers. In this way, financial market intermediaries exist because they can improve\nupon the allocation of resources among savers and borrowers that can be achieved using a\ndirect investment market alone. The harder it is for savers to get direct, reliable\ninformation about borrowers, the greater the role intermediaries will play in the financial\nsystem.\nMechanism design theory provides an approach for addressing precisely these questions\nabout how institutions arise and adapt in response to incentive and information problems.\nThis approach then allows us to study and compare the diverse institutions that exist in an\neconomy and play a role in the allocation of resources – markets, firms, banks, clearing\nhouses, and even central banks and governments. More precisely, these contractual and\n\n3\n\n\finstitutional arrangements all constitute alternative mechanisms for allocating resources,\nand the approach is to study the properties of the best possible resource allocations that\nany mechanism is capable of achieving. For example, how well does it do at funding\nappropriate investments and allocating the attendant risk? One can then compare how\nclose alternative mechanisms come to achieving those allocations. If one set of\narrangements can achieve superior allocations, but others cannot, then one has a\ncandidate explanation for why such an intermediary might exist.\nAny set of institutional or contractual arrangements – any mechanism – will naturally be\nconstrained by the initial availability of resources and technologies, but they also will be\nconstrained by the degree to which information is limited and dispersed. For example, if\nyou want to allocate credit to the highest quality borrowers, you need a way of\ndetermining who the highest quality borrowers are. If you want to share with a broad set\nof investors the risks associated with lending to a large pool of mortgage borrowers,\nsomeone needs to be able to keep track of the performance of the actual loans, and\ninvestors need to trust that that task will be performed effectively and honestly. These are\nexamples of limited information in resource allocation problems.\nClassical economics was based largely on the notion that markets were a particularly\neffective institution for efficiently allocating resources, and especially adept at\naggregating the diverse information held by large numbers of widely dispersed market\nparticipants. An earlier Nobel laureate – George Ackerlof – described a specific\ninformational problem that can hamper a market’s effectiveness. He labeled this the\n“Lemons Problem,” and it occurs when a good can come in varying qualities, and when\nsellers, but not buyers, can distinguish high from low quality prior to a transaction\noccurring. 3 Buyers of used cars can’t easily distinguish good from bad, so higher quality\ncannot easily command a higher price and would-be sellers of higher quality cars keep\ntheir cars off the market. This is a specific example of a general phenomenon known as\n“adverse selection,” which also applies to the credit market problem of figuring out who\nare the best borrowers. Other types of informational problems that can be relevant in the\nallocation of credit include “moral hazard” – the problem that a lender cannot always\nmonitor or precisely prescribe the actions to be taken by a borrower – as well as the\ngeneral problem that a borrower may be in a position to misrepresent the outcome of his\nuse of funds. 4\nThe constraints imposed on achievable outcomes by informational asymmetries should be\ncommon sense to this audience. An array of commonly observed contractual features\nappear aimed at limiting a debtor’s moral hazard – for example, material adverse change\nclauses and other debt covenants limit the distortion to risk-taking incentives. More\nbroadly, mechanism design supports our traditional understanding of banks as specialists\nin the information-intensive aspects of finance. The modern version of that understanding\nis that bank-like intermediaries are an efficient mechanism for the organization of credit\nmarkets in the face of adverse selection or other informational frictions. A number of\nadvances in the economics of financial intermediation have taken this approach. 5\n\n4\n\n\fIt’s important to realize that real-world financial institutions are much more complex than\nin the typical model studied by mechanism design. So this theory is not yet ready to give\nus precise answers about how to design institutions in practical applications. But as a set\nof theoretical tools it helps us to understand, in a careful and internally consistent way,\nhow the institutional arrangements we actually observe arise as adaptive responses to\nimportant characteristics of real-world resource allocation problems.\nThinking about financial markets and institutions in terms of mechanism design also can\nhelp us understand the process of financial innovation. I have spoken elsewhere, as have\nmany other observers, about the wave of innovation in financial instruments and practices\nthat swept through the economy in recent decades. 6 Improvements in communications\nand computing technology lowered the cost of transmitting and analyzing information,\nand appeared to reduce informational constraints and expand the set of attainable\noutcomes. Achieving improved allocations required new economic mechanisms – new\ntypes of financial instruments and new types of financial institutions.\nBut finding the arrangements that reaped the benefits of the expanded opportunities made\npossible by new technologies required some experimentation in economic mechanisms.\nThe realization of opportunities for improvement is rarely certain, because the use of\nmechanism design in actual financial market practice sometimes does not proceed as\nneatly as it might on the theorist’s whiteboard. In order to know whether a new\ncontractual form or institutional arrangement represents an improvement, it must be tried.\nIts success or failure provides information that will inform future efforts at innovation.\n\nThe Credit Market Tumult of the Summer of 2007\nThe story of how we got to where we found ourselves this summer – circumstances that\ninduced the Federal Reserve to alter credit terms at the discount window – is a story\nabout financial innovation, a story of experimentation in economic mechanisms.\nApplication of information technology to the gathering and analysis of data on\nborrowers’ financial histories resulted in finer assessments of credit risk and expanded\naccess to home mortgage credit for borrowers with riskier credit profiles. The improved\nassessment of credit risk, along with other advances in information technology, also\nfacilitated the broad development of markets in which individual loans are pooled and\nsecuritized, thus allowing these pooled exposures to be priced in active capital markets.\nThe decisions of participants in these innovative financial arrangements – including\nborrowers, originators, securitizers, funding providers, rating agencies, and of course\ninvestors – all embodied implicit judgments regarding the likelihood of success. As\nhousing markets slowed beginning in early 2006, delinquencies and defaults on subprime\nand some nontraditional mortgages rose more rapidly than had been anticipated. With\nhindsight those original expectations appear to have been disappointed along several\ndimensions. Home price decelerations and downturns across a number of regions meant\nthat many borrowers with little or no home equity at purchase would have an incentive to\nskip payments in the event of financial stress. And anecdotal reports suggest that the\n\n5\n\n\fability of loan originators to contain the incentive of borrowers or mortgage brokers to\nfalsify documentation on so-called “no-doc” or “low-doc” loans was overestimated.\nThe bottom line, then, was that aggregate conditions in the housing market had led to\ngreater than anticipated losses on many of the new mortgage products. This meant\ninevitably that at least some of the securities derived from these products would\nunderperform as well. But the complexity of the securitization process, as well as the\nprocess by which securities were re-intermediated in commercial paper programs or\ncollateralized debt obligations, made it hard to sort out where that underperformance\nwould surface. This opacity appeared to create a general distrust – a lemons problem –\nwhich often depressed trading activity in markets for mortgage-related instruments. This\nproblem was particularly acute at times, such as in mid-August, when risks were being\nreassessed fairly rapidly.\nAlthough the complex web of contractual financing arrangements in mortgage finance\nare somewhat beyond our ability to model formally, mechanism design theory does\nprovide useful perspectives. For example, the strain experienced by many financial\ninstitutions suggests that one of the lessons from this recent experiment in applied\nmechanism design is that a mechanism that we expect to work well in normal\ncircumstances may disappoint if the unexpected happens.\n\nThe Role of the Central Bank in Credit Markets: Regulating Credit\nThere are two related, but distinct roles that the Federal Reserve has to play in relation to\ncredit market mechanisms. First, the Fed is a regulator with supervisory authority over\nsignificant parts of the financial system. A financial regulator has a fine line to walk\nregarding innovation and experimentation of the type recently seen in credit markets. We\nusually think of innovation and experimentation as being good things, and I believe this\nis true in financial markets as well. But the existence of the financial safety net for\ndepository institutions does mean that there may be some contingencies to which private\nmarket participants pay less than optimal attention. Experimentation is a form of risk\ntaking after all. And like any risk-taking activity, there is a legitimate supervisory interest\nin assessing the prudence with which institutions undertake innovative activities or\nproducts.\nWhat makes striking this balance difficult is that, by its nature, assessing the risks\nassociated with an innovative activity does not lend itself as neatly to quantitative risk\nmeasurement tools. Quantitative risk assessment requires data from reasonably\ncomparable circumstances, which is often lacking when we are talking about a new\nactivity or product. For example, there was no obvious historical parallel to the scale of\nsubprime lending in recent years – certainly not over an entire cycle of expansion and\ncontraction in housing market activity. Rather than resisting financial innovation\nwholesale, supervisors should look at this kind of activity in the broader context of an\ninstitution’s systems and processes for evaluating risks and making decisions, as well as\nthe institution’s capital position.\n\n6\n\n\fPrudential regulatory regimes can exert an independent influence on the direction and\ncharacter of financial innovation. Indeed, at times financial innovations appear to derive a\nportion of their benefits from their ability to bypass regulatory constraints and capital\nlevies on the activities of covered intermediaries. This does not mean that such\ninnovations are necessarily undesirable, but it does imply that supervisors need to assess\nthe extent to which a particular innovation expands the set of allocations the financial\nsystem is capable of delivering, and should scrutinize such innovations to try to ensure\nconsistent and uniform treatment of economically equivalent arrangements. 7\n\nThe Role of the Central Bank in Credit Markets: Extending Credit\nBeyond its role as a regulator, the Fed, like other central banks, also has the role of lender\nof last resort. Through their discount windows, the Federal Reserve Banks offer\ncollateralized loans to qualified depository institutions. The traditional view of a central\nbank’s role as a lender of last resort dates back 200 years to the English economist Henry\nThornton. Later in the 19th century, his ideas were elaborated upon by Walter Bagehot,\nand it is from Bagehot that most modern thinking on the topic derives. 8 The prescription\nstemming from this tradition can be stated simply – in times of financial stress, the\ncentral bank should lend freely at a penalty rate, on good collateral, to sound institutions.\nCurrent Federal Reserve policy conforms well to classical lender of last resort doctrine;\nthe discount rate is set at a fixed spread above the target federal funds rate, and solvent\ndepository institutions are free to borrow up to the amount of the collateral they have\npledged. Collateral haircuts are applied to provide cushion against loss, and to avoid\ndistorting markets for the underlying collateral.\nThis traditional view of central bank lending aims for a balance between potential costs\nand benefits. The benefits stem from the central bank’s ability to provide liquidity to\nfinancial markets. Without an adequate supply of reserves, financial markets might not\nfunction effectively, resulting in increased costs of credit and reduced economic activity.\nBut in this regard, it is important to remember that 19th century observers wrote at a time\nwhen lending really was the only way the central bank provided liquidity. Indeed, when\nthe Fed was founded in 1913, discount window lending was envisioned as the primary\nmeans of providing reserves to the banking system. Today, the Fed’s primary means of\nsupplying reserves is through open-market operations, which is how the federal funds\nrate is kept at the target rate. In fact the effect of discount window loans on the overall\nsupply of liquidity is automatically offset, or “sterilized,” to avoid pushing the federal\nfunds rate below the target. So it is important to distinguish carefully a central bank’s\nmonetary policy function of regulating the total supply of reserves from central bank\ncredit policy, which reallocates reserves among banks. 9\nThere can be situations in which impediments prevent the market from effectively\nredistributing reserves among banks. In such situations, central bank lending can be\nuseful because it can provide liquidity to specific institutions that would otherwise be\nunable to obtain it directly from other banks. A prime example is the period just after the\n\n7\n\n\fterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when operational problems constrained interbank\nfunds transfers. 10\nThe potential cost of central bank lending is that it can distort private credit markets. This\ncost can apply in both the short run and the long run. The potential long run cost is the\nfamiliar problem of moral hazard. That is, central bank lending, to the extent that it\nlessens the pain felt by institutions in a particular event, could reasonably create an\nexpectation that similar relief would be forthcoming in similar events in the future. Such\nan expectation can affect the exposures that market participants are willing to take on in\nthe future. This potential for a long run cost in the form of incentive distortions exists\neven if the central bank’s action is beneficial on net in the short run.\nEven in the short run, central bank lending can interact with private credit evaluation in a\npotentially costly way. A central bank that is willing to lend against a particular type of\ncollateral on terms more favorable than are available in the market could raise the market\nvalue of that collateral above what it otherwise would be. Whether this effect is desirable\ndepends on whether the market’s price is “right.” By right price, when talking about asset\nprices, we usually mean in line with fundamentals – that is, with an unbiased assessment\nof the risks and expected returns available from holding an asset.\nTo take a concrete example, this summer we saw a dramatic decline in the trading of\nmortgage-related assets, particularly those tied to subprime or other nontraditional\nmortgages. Market participants seeking to sell or borrow against such assets could do so\nonly at steep discounts. One possible interpretation of these events is that the market for\nthese assets was suffering from a loss of “liquidity” – the market froze up, and in effect,\nnobody was trading because nobody else was trading. Under this view, what trades did\noccur took place below the “fundamental value” of the assets. This view implies a\npotentially beneficial role for a credit policy intervention, in the form of central bank\nlending to help relax constraints on liquidity supply and allow prices to move toward\nfundamental values. 11\nAn alternative interpretation of depressed asset prices is that the fundamentals had\nchanged. Realizations of growing losses on the underlying class of mortgages caused the\ntrue economic value of these assets to fall. In this view, overall market liquidity was\nadequate, as evidenced by the significant amount of funds that had been shifted out of\nmortgage-related assets and in principle were available to reinvest at appropriate prices.\nIn other words, prices weren’t distorted by a lack of funds in the hands of informed\ninvestors. Under this view, central bank lending against the assets at above-market terms\nwould risk undermining the private market’s risk assessments.\nThis highlights the dilemma that I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, namely, the\ndifficulty of discerning in a meaningful way whether assets are trading below their\n“fundamental” values. The usual presumption in normal times is that an asset’s market\nprice is the best available estimate of its fundamental value, a presumption that flows\nfrom a robust understanding about the functioning of market mechanisms. In contrast, the\nnotion of assets trading below fundamental values is based on alternative models in\n\n8\n\n\fwhich some impediments distort traded asset prices. Whether central bank lending would\nrelax those constraints appears to depend delicately on the particular model in hand.\nThis illustrates a fundamental question, motivated by the insights of mechanism design,\nwhich is useful to keep in mind when contemplating central bank credit policy: In what\nway would central bank lending improve the set of attainable resource allocations in\nfinancial markets? For example, is the central bank any better than private market\nparticipants at distinguishing between good and bad assets? Is the central bank better able\nto discern the fundamental value of an asset?\nIt is possible that a central bank with a substantial supervisory role could have an\ninformational advantage over market participants, but in many cases any such advantage\nis likely to be small, I think. The task of differentiating among mortgage-backed\nsecurities for example, would seem to require looking closely at the characteristics of the\nunderlying mortgages. That’s a costly process, and I’m not sure it would be any less\ncostly for the Fed than for a private counterparty.\nThis discussion points back to my foray into mechanism design theory. Understanding\nthe role of the central bank in credit market mechanisms starts with an understanding of\njust what it is that a central bank can do that other participants cannot. The central bank\ncan increase the amount of reserves held by the banking system or by particular banks.\nOne of the ways it can do this is by extending credit at terms at which private\ncounterparties will not. Ultimately, the evaluation of a Fed action depends on why it is\nthat lending from private counterparties was only available at less attractive terms. Was it\na shortage of liquidity, or was it a change in fundamental valuations? This is a hard\njudgment to make in the crush of events and answers may only become apparent long\nafter the fact. But this ambiguity is what makes the prudent, traditional prescription for\ncentral bank lending – lend freely at a penalty rate, on good collateral, to sound\ninstitutions – an attractive dictum. By standing ready to lend, and fixing a rate above the\nnormal market rate, the central bank can limit the impact of market disruptions while also\nlimiting its own need to make credit judgments. In effect, the central bank offers a line of\ncredit to banking institutions. Just as the private provider of a line of credit imposes\nconditions and constraints on its customers, so should the central bank seek to provide\nsuch a credit facility in a way that avoids interference with private market risk\nassessments. 12\nAs I said, it may be some time before we have a full understanding of this summer’s\nevents. But my reading of the evidence is that the episode was less about liquidity than it\nwas simply about a dramatic change in the valuation of a class of credit exposures. Even\nwith the Fed’s reduction in the spread between its federal funds target and its primary\ncredit discount window rates, and its encouragement to banks to come to the window, the\namount of borrowing did not rise very much. So I think there’s a good chance that, when\nall is said and done, we will be able to say that the Fed did the right thing. We stood\nready to lend – on good collateral at a penalty rate – but did not interfere with the\nmarket’s assessment of risks.\n1\n\nI am grateful for help from John Weinberg in preparing this speech.\n\n9\n\n\f2\n\nPrize Committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, “Scientific Background on the Sveriges\nRiksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel: Mechanism Design Theory,” October,\n2007, http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2007/ecoadv07.pdf\n3\nAkerlof, George, “The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism,” Quarterly\nJournal of Economics, 84/3 (August, 1970), 488-500.\n4\nStandard examples include Holstrom, Bengt, “Moral Hazard and Observability,” Bell Journal of\nEconomics, 10/1 (Spring 1979), 74-91; and Townsend, Robert, “Optimal Contracts and Competitive\nMarkets with Costly State Verification,” Journal of Economic Theory, 21/2 (October 1979), 265-93.\n5\nTownsend, Robert, “Intermediation with Costly Bilateral Exchange,” Review of Economic Studies, 45/3\n(October 1978), 417-25; Boyd, John and Edward C.

            "content": "The Economic Outlook\nCharlotte Risk Management Association\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nAugust 21, 2007\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nI am pleased to be with you here today to discuss my views on the economic outlook. 1\nWhen this date was arranged many months ago, I was looking forward to delivering my\nremarks during the sleepy dog days of summer. Instead, we meet during fairly\ntumultuous times in financial markets. Over the last several weeks, we have seen\nsubstantial revisions in market participants’ assessments of the fundamental value of\nsecurities related to sub-prime and other non-standard mortgages, financial distress\nrelated to mortgage finance at several entities, considerable widening of credit spreads,\nand significantly larger swings in asset prices. This turbulence makes assessing the\neconomic outlook more challenging than usual, and of course makes central bank\npolicymaking especially challenging.\nIn the wake of this recent turbulence, the predominant concern for macroeconomic policy\nrevolves around the potential effects on real spending by consumers and businesses. It is\nquite possible for financial market developments like we have seen over the last few\nweeks to have just minimal effects on real activity. On the other hand, there are several\nchannels by which such episodes could cause a weakening of spending. Indeed, the\nFederal Open Market Committee in its statement last Friday morning noted that “the\ndownside risks to growth have increased appreciably.” With the situation still unfolding,\na fair amount of uncertainty remains, however, and I will be scrutinizing the incoming\ndata very closely for clues about the evolution of the outlook for inflation and growth.\nMy remarks today will focus on how recent developments affect the outlook for inflation\nand growth. I will begin by reviewing the events that have roiled financial markets in\nrecent weeks, and then discuss the economic outlook as it appears right now, beginning\nwith inflation and then turning to the prospects for growth in aggregate spending by\nhouseholds and firms. Along the way, I will comment on the potential implications, and I\nshould emphasize potential, of recent financial market turbulence for the outlook. As\nalways, these remarks are my own personal views, and are not necessarily shared by my\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve.\nFinancial markets\nJust as housing plays a leading role in the outlook for the real economy, housing finance\nhas played a leading role in current market turbulence, so it’s worth briefly reviewing the\nrecent evolution of housing-related credit markets. The expansion of home mortgage\ncredit in the last several years to borrowers with riskier credit profiles – either because of\ntheir credit histories or because of the types of non-traditional mortgage contracts with\n\n\fwhich they financed their home purchases – was part of a longer and broader wave of\nretail financial innovation. 1 At the heart of this wave was the application of information\ntechnology to the gathering and analysis of data on borrowers’ financial histories. This\nallowed more differentiated assessments of risk at the level of the individual borrower.\nUltimately, this made possible the tailoring of products to borrowers with different risk\ncharacteristics and broadened access to credit for many riskier borrowers who otherwise\nwould have been unable to borrow. These developments appeared first in the market for\nunsecured consumer credit and then spread to housing finance, especially in the last\ndecade.\nThe improved assessment of credit, along with other advances in information technology,\nalso facilitated the broad development of markets in which individual loans are pooled\nand securitized, which allowed these pooled exposures to be priced in active capital\nmarkets. The role of the capital markets in securitized lending to households can be\nthought of as complementary to the role of the institutions that originate the loans. Since\nsecurities pool the risks of individual borrowers, the realized return on such pools will be\ndominated by aggregate risk factors – that is, factors affecting broad segments of\nborrowers. Investors in such securities will require compensation for the relevant\naggregate risk factors affecting the average return on the pooled loans, but not for the\nidiosyncratic risk associated with any particular loan. Capital markets accumulate the\nperspectives of many investors and produce a collective assessment of these aggregate\nrisks that is then reflected in the interest rate and terms that the originating institution\noffers to borrowers.\nNote that market assessments of securitized portfolios also embody assessments of the\neffectiveness of the originating institution at managing the risks inherent in the\nunderwriting process. For example, anecdotal reports suggest that mortgage companies\nthat originated and sold so-called “no-doc” or “low-doc” loans may have been especially\nvulnerable to falsification by their brokers. While the extent of such fraud is not known,\nsuch vulnerabilities are a form of aggregate portfolio risk to the extent that they are\ncapable of influencing the relative returns of different mortgage pools, and capital market\npricing embodies an implicit view on the magnitude of such risks.\nAs housing markets slowed beginning in early 2006, delinquencies and defaults on\nsubprime and some nontraditional mortgages rose more rapidly than had been expected\nby investors in the related securities, particularly on the most recent origination vintages.\nThe concentration of rising delinquency rates among subprime adjustable-rate mortgages\nsuggests that borrowers who just met qualification criteria were most likely to experience\nrepayment problems. And the coincidence of rising delinquencies with the end of housing\nprice appreciation, along with the fact that auto and credit card delinquencies have not\nrisen nearly as much, suggests that minimal housing equity has been a significant\ninfluence on the propensity of borrowers to miss payments. The fact that newer loans are\nperforming markedly worse than more seasoned credits also supports this view.\nThe realization of greater-than-anticipated losses lies at the center of much of the recent\nfinancial market volatility. While we normally think of capital markets as effective at\n\n2\n\n\fassessing and pricing risks, there is a general impression that markets got it wrong in the\ncase of sub-prime and other nontraditional mortgage finance. It might seem obvious that\nmarket participants were – perhaps naively – too optimistic about mortgage credit quality\nduring the housing expansion. But thinking of the expansion as driven by financial\ninnovation provides a useful perspective as well, I believe. Any innovation brings with it\nconsiderable uncertainty about how big of a change from past behavior it will bring\nabout. In particular, much of what was new in mortgage lending had not been through the\ntest of a significant slow-down in home sales and home prices. Assessments of how such\nmortgage portfolios would perform in such scenarios relied less on data from similar\nepisodes and more on extrapolation and inference from normal times, and thus were\ninherently more uncertain. All product or service innovations rely to a similar extent on\nextrapolation. In this regard, misjudgment about the prospects for losses in this new wave\nof innovative mortgage financing is similar to misjudgments made in the late 1990s about\nthe rate at which demand for telecommunications bandwidth was going to grow.\nThe housing downturn has revealed information that now is feeding the process of\nreassessing and repricing risk. Market participants as diverse as mutual funds, hedge\nfunds, banks and broker-dealers have struggled to re-evaluate the risks associated with\nvarious segments of the mortgage market. As those risks have been reassessed, the prices\nof mortgage-backed securities have adjusted accordingly. In some cases, the prices\nbuyers are willing to pay are below the prices at which originators are willing to sell, and\nquantities traded have sunk to near zero.\nThis reassessment has gone somewhat beyond subprime mortgages and nontraditional\nmortgages. More broadly, securities related to a range of so-called non-agency\nmortgages, even to borrowers with high credit scores, have seen a widening of spreads.\nSome institutions whose profitability depends heavily on securitizing the mortgages they\noriginate have seen their credit spreads widen significantly as well, especially compared\nto institutions that are better positioned to absorb new originations on their own balance\nsheets. Market participants also appear to be re-evaluating the mortgage-related\nexposures of a range of intermediaries. And credit spreads have widened as well for\nmany corporate borrowers below the highest credit ratings.\nThese market adjustments place many participants in difficult positions. Some have\nexperienced significant losses or have gone bankrupt. Entities that issue commercial\npaper or other instruments to fund their ongoing flow of originated mortgages are finding\nit difficult to continue that funding at rates they find satisfactory. In some cases, they are\ndiverting their pipeline to their own balance sheet; in other cases, issuers are drawing on\nbackup lines of credit. More generally, sizable shifts in market valuations are leading\nother participants to seek to adjust their portfolios substantially, adding to market\nvolatility in a range of assets. The breadth of risk assessments has enhanced the relative\nattractiveness of, and driven down the yield on, highly liquid instruments such as U.S.\nTreasury securities, particularly at short tenors. The market for asset-backed commercial\npaper has been particularly stressed by these developments.\n\n3\n\n\fIn the days leading up to the FOMC meeting on Aug. 7, many observers, citing the\nturbulent market conditions, called on and expected the Fed to lower its target interest\nrate. As you know, the Committee did not do that, but instead held the federal funds rate\nat five-and-a-quarter percent. In its statement, the Committee recognized that recent\nfinancial volatility had raised the risks to real activity, but emphasized that the\nfundamentals for broader household and business spending continue to look fairly sound.\nThe Committee also emphasized in that statement that risks to inflation remained a\npredominant concern.\nEven without a change in the interest rate target, the Fed has tools at its disposal that can\nhelp the market make necessary adjustments in times like these. The Federal Reserve\nBank of New York, acting on behalf of the System, uses open market operations to keep\nthe overnight federal funds rate at or close to the FOMC’s target rate. This has had the\neffect of automatically expanding the supply of reserves to the banking system as the\ndemand for liquidity has risen during this market turbulence. The week before last, the\ndesired levels of reserve holdings rose at many banks, which tended to put upward\npressure on the price of overnight loans of reserves in the federal funds market. The New\nYork Fed offset this increase in the demand for reserves by adding a significant amount\nof funds on Friday, Aug. 3, through its open market operations, so as to keep the funds\nrate near the five-and-a-quarter percent target. Since then, reserve demand has been\nespecially variable, and thus the effective federal funds rate has been correspondingly\nmore variable from day to day around the Committee’s target.\nLast week, financial market volatility intensified as news emerged regarding important\nmarket participants and commentary suggested heightened anxiety about the evolution of\nfinancial conditions in certain markets. On Thursday evening, Aug. 16, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee convened by video conference and adopted a revised statement\nregarding the economic outlook. In a separate action, the Board of Governors accepted\nthe requests of two Reserve Banks for a reduction in the discount rate from 6 ¼ to 5 ¾\npercent. The 10 other Reserve Banks requested similar discount rate reductions the\nfollowing day, which the Board accepted. This decision was noteworthy because, since\n2002, the Reserve Banks have set their discount rates as a penalty rate, 100 basis points\nabove the target federal funds rate. Lowering the spread over the funds rate target reduces\nthe premium banks pay to obtain credit at the discount window. The Board’s statement\nalso announced a change in the Reserve Banks’ usual practices to allow the provision of\nterm financing for as long as 30 days, renewable by the borrower. The Board noted that\nthese changes, which are temporary, are designed “to provide depositories with greater\nassurance about the cost and availability of funding” and “(t)o promote the restoration of\norderly conditions in financial markets.” The Board’s announcement also stated that\n“(e)xisting collateral margins will be maintained,” so lending will be on good collateral\nwith prudent haircuts, consistent with classic lender of last resort doctrine. 2 Sound\ndiscount window policy, I believe, should aim at supplying adequate liquidity without\nundermining the market’s assessment of risk. Conservative collateral requirements and\ncharging a penalty rate are important prerequisites for that policy objective.\nThe Real Economy\n\n4\n\n\fThe Committee’s action last week underscores an important point. Financial market\nvolatility, in and of itself, does not require a change in the target federal funds rate, in my\nview. Interest rate policy needs to be guided by the outlook for real spending and\ninflation. Financial turbulence has the potential to change the assessment of the\nappropriate rate if it induces a sufficient revision in growth or inflation prospects.\nEven before the recent stint of financial market turbulence, the predominant concern on\nthe real side of the economy was the outlook for housing activity. Residential investment\nfell rapidly over the last three quarters of 2006, but then the rate of decline slowed in the\nfirst half of this year. The question in my mind a couple of months ago concerned\nwhether home-building would bottom out soon or continue declining. Recent data on\nactual housing market activity have dampened my optimism, however. Housing starts\nand residential building permits, which earlier this year looked as if they might be\nstabilizing, have both softened in the last couple of months. Broader measures of sales\nactivity are also showing a pronounced downward trend.\nWhile the housing market implications of the recent financial market turmoil are quite\nunclear at this stage, there is a possibility that it will result in further increases in retail\nmortgage rates for some borrower classes and thus further dampen residential investment.\nMortgage rate spreads have risen substantially for subprime borrowers, as one would\nexpect given what has transpired, and for any borrowers with low down payments and\nlow documentation. In the last few weeks, rates have moved up for jumbo mortgages as\nwell. It is not yet clear, however, to what extent some of these increases will persist or to\nwhat extent they represent transitory responses to temporarily heightened uncertainty.\nBusiness investment spending has been an impressive source of strength over much of\nthis expansion. Real spending on equipment and software increased at a healthy 6.2\npercent annual rate from the first quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2006. Spending\non structures picked up at the end of 2005, increasing at a 13 percent rate since then.\nBusiness investment faltered late last year, with weaker sales of autos and construction\nmaterials apparently playing important roles. Most of the fundamentals for business\ninvestment are still quite positive, however; profitability is high and the cost of capital is\nstill fairly low, despite recent financial market developments. Thus investment could well\nmaintain momentum this year, I believe, and we have been seeing some favorable signs.\nFor example, manufacturing production increased by 2.2 percent from March through\nJuly.\nIt is worth noting here that there is one area in which financial market events could affect\nbusiness investment spending. One of the market segments in which activity has slowed\ndramatically in recent weeks is in the financing of leveraged buy-outs used to take\ncompanies private. Here, as in the mortgage-backed segment, we have seen rising credit\nspreads, especially for instruments below investment grade, and significantly reduced\nissuance. These transactions seem to have been motivated more by restructuring\nliabilities and governance arrangements and less by a need to fund near-term capital\n\n5\n\n\fspending. Given the other strong fundamentals for business spending, it is not clear that\nthe rising cost of buy-out financing should have significant effects on real investment.\nSome observers have questioned the outlook for consumer spending, often citing\nstatistics that lead them to believe that consumer debt is too high or consumer saving is\ntoo low. I won’t argue with the data – by the usual measures, saving is quite low, with the\nwidely cited personal saving rate clocking in at a meager 0.6 percent for the second\nquarter. But keep in mind that the personal saving rate has been on a downward trend\nfrom about 10 percent in the early 1980s. A number of forces could potentially be at play\nhere, including, for example, the significant credit market innovations that have taken\nplace over that period. 3 I understand how historical averages can exert a gravitational pull\non the forecasts of variables like the saving rate, and I don’t believe the downward trend\nin the saving rate is likely to persist indefinitely. But having said that, it’s not obvious to\nme why we should expect that long-term trend to reverse itself anytime soon.\nAn alternative perspective on savings and consumption is that the recent growth in\nhousehold spending indicates confidence in future income prospects, rather than any\nfundamental recklessness. The labor market is reasonably tight, with the unemployment\nrate at 4.6 percent. Earnings are growing at about a 4 percent rate. The working age\npopulation is growing at a 0.9 percent annual rate, and payroll employment has grown\nsignificantly more rapidly, at a 1.6 percent rate for the last few years. While employment\ngrowth won’t be above average forever, prospects for real income growth look pretty\ngood. Moreover, household net worth was a relatively high 5 2/3 years of disposable\npersonal income as of the first quarter, and has been rising during this recovery, which\nsuggests that savings, properly measured, might not be so low after all. As always, real\nwage growth will tend to track gains in labor productivity, and while productivity growth\nwas fairly strong for the first several years of this decade, the recent slowdown is a\nnegative risk for consumer spending.\nFinancial market turmoil has the potential to make households apprehensive and thereby\ncause a precautionary pullback in consumer spending. We have numerous experiences in\nthe past several decades, however, of declines in household financial net worth, and\nexperience suggests that the effect on household spending tends to be small. Evidently,\nconsumer expectations regarding their future income prospects is a stabilizing influence\non their spending plans.\nAn alternative channel through which recent financial market developments might\nconceivably affect consumer spending is through an increase in interest rate spreads. So\nfar, however, consumer interest rates have risen appreciably only in selected segments of\nthe mortgage market, and other rates have held steady. As a result, I believe the\nlikelihood of the recent turbulence inducing a slowdown in consumer spending is\nrelatively small at this point.\nOn balance, then, I still expect consumer spending to be reasonably healthy, and for\nbusiness investment to continue to expand. But I expect overall growth to come in\nsomewhat below its long-term trend for the remainder of this year, based on my\n\n6\n\n\fexpectation that the drag from housing will continue for some time. The most plausible\ndownside risk is that financial market developments will lead to higher mortgage rate\nspreads and will further depress housing activity. Other finance-related risks to economic\ngrowth appear to be relatively minor.\nThe Inflation Outlook\nAs recently as its Aug. 7 meeting, the FOMC identified its “predominant policy risk” as\n“the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.” I believe that this risk remains\nrelevant, although some recent reports have been encouraging. Since February, 12-month\ncore inflation has eased down, falling below 2 percent in June. While the most recent\nmonths’ figures have been encouraging, it is still too soon to be confident that the\nmoderation we have been seeing represents a downward trend. A similar moderation that\noccurred in the last months of 2006 was followed by a subsequent uptick.\nThe FOMC often talks about inflation in terms of core measures – leaving out the prices\nof energy and food products. This focus has the potential for causing some confusion. If\nwe are seeking to stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar, and I believe we are, why\nleave out purchases on which people spend significant sums? Before addressing this\nquestion, let me first note that the story of what has happened to inflation recently is\nbroadly similar if we look at overall inflation. Inflation rose from 2004 to 2005, reaching\na peak of 3.9 percent, year-over-year, in September of 2005 as energy prices spiked.\nSince then, year-over-year overall inflation has fluctuated more widely than core but has\ngenerally trended down from its peak. In recent months, overall inflation has been\nslightly above core inflation, with June coming in at 2.3 percent, year over year, down\nfrom 3.5 percent a year earlier.\nMonetary policy requires looking forward at where inflation is headed. So while\nmeasures of overall inflation gauge well where inflation has been, the question is how\nbest to determine the likely trend in inflation – that is, what is the most likely behavior of\ninflation in the very near future?\nThere are many ways – many statistical tools – to try to extract a trend from data on\ninflation. One simple approach is to use the standard measure of core inflation. The\njustification for this approach is based on the historical behavior of food and energy\nprices. These two components of overall price indexes have typically proven to be very\nvolatile. They move around a lot due to movements in temporary factors affecting supply\nand demand in the markets for food and energy products. More precisely, current\nmovements in food and energy prices do not appear to alter the expected future rate of\nincrease in these prices. If this supposition is correct, then the trend in core inflation\nmight be the best forecast of trends in overall inflation. In this case, stabilizing the trend\nin core inflation and stabilizing overall inflation amount to the same thing, since swings\nin non-core inflation will not affect the outlook for the overall inflation trend.\nThe bottom line is that monetary policymakers most definitely care about overall\ninflation, but they tend to talk about core inflation measures because they are viewed as\n\n7\n\n\fmore informative about future trends in overall indexes. And by either measure, the most\nrecent news on inflation trends has been favorable.\nHaving said that, I believe there are still reasons to remain concerned about the risks to\nthe inflation outlook. First, there are indications that the recent improvement may have\nbeen transitory, and that we may see inflation remain at this level, or perhaps even move\nup again. Second, the public’s expectations of future inflation – an important determinant\nof inflation trends – appear to be inconsistent with further reductions in inflation. Survey\nmeasures of inflation expectations – such as the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of\nprofessional Forecasters or the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Survey –\nhave recently been indicating long-term expectations ranging from 2.4 percent at a 10year horizon (SPF) to 3.1 percent at the 5- to 10-year horizon. Similarly, measures of\nexpectations of inflation 5 to 10 years forward, derived from the yields on Treasury\nInflation Protected Securities (TIPS), have remained near or above 2.5 percent. All of\nthese expectations measures are for the CPI. Taken together, they imply long-run\nexpectations for PCE inflation perhaps slightly above 2 percent, which is greater than the\nmost recent year-over-year readings we’ve received.\nAlthough these long-run expectations suggest trend inflation is above where I would like\nit to be, it is encouraging that they do not appear to be rising in response to recent\nfinancial market developments. Market participants have marked down their expected\npath for the federal funds rate, and a coincident rise in inflation expectations would have\nraised significant policy concerns. I believe central banks should be careful to conduct\npolicy during periods of financial market distress in ways that are consistent with their\nlong-run goals, both for price stability and economic growth.\nTo summarize, a great deal of uncertainty remains about if and how recent developments\nwill alter the outlook for the real economy and inflation. As events continue to unfold, I\nwill be watching for signs that changes in the cost of credit might be having broader\neffects on spending than we have seen or seem likely so far. I will also continue to\nmonitor the indicators of inflation and inflation expectations. Going forward, I think there\nare two key principles that should inform policy. First, the provision of liquidity to\nfinancial markets should seek to not interfere with the market’s assessment and pricing of\nrisk. And second, federal funds rate adjustments in response to changes in the outlook for\ninflation and growth should continue to endeavor to stabilize inflation expectations.\nConduct of policy guided by these principles can minimize the real effects of financial\nmarket volatility.\n\n1\n\nIn preparing these remarks I benefited from the assistance of John Weinberg and Roy Webb.\nLacker, “Retail Financial Innovation,” speech to the Virginia Bankers’ Association, June 14 2005.\n2\nBagehot, Walter, “Lombard Street: a Description of the Money Market.” New York: Orion 1991 (original\nedition, New York: Scribner Armtrong, 1873); Humphrey, Thomas, and Robert Keleher, “Lender of last\nResort: a Historical Perspective,” Cato Journal v. 4 n. 1, 1981; Goodfriend, Marvin and Jeffrey Lacker,\n“Limited Commitment and Central Banking,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly,\nFall 1999.\n1\n\n8\n\n\f3\n\nJohn Weinberg, “Borrowing by U.S. Households,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond 2005 Annual\nReport..\n\n9\n\n\f",

            "content": "Early Childhood Development and Economic Growth\nGovernor’s Summit on Early Childhood Development\nRichmond, Virginia\nJuly 27, 2007\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nEarly childhood development may seem like an odd topic for a Federal Reserve Bank\npresident. 1 The public policy responsibility for which the Fed is best known is the\nnation’s monetary policy – a macroeconomic subject that would seem to stand in sharp\ncontrast to the more microeconomic focus of Governor Kaine’s summit today. But as a\nregional Reserve Bank in a federated central banking system like the Fed, we spend a\ngood deal of time trying to understand the economies that make up our District, which, as\nyou may know, includes Maryland, D.C., Virginia, West Virginia and the Carolinas. We\nsupplement formal data on the national economy with information we gather from\nnumerous sources – both formal and informal – about economic conditions in our region.\nThis process gives us an opportunity to observe and learn about the economic trends and\nchallenges facing the people of our District. It also allows us to observe the range of\npublic policies and private initiatives undertaken across the District aimed at promoting\nlocal and regional economic growth.\nOur interest in growth derives directly from our mandate, which includes both\nmaximizing employment and ensuring price stability. Although it is now widely known\nthat the best contribution monetary policy can make to growth is to keep inflation low\nand stable, 2 understanding the wellsprings of growth is essential to our work. More\nbroadly, to an economist, comparative economic growth makes an irresistible topic. The\nmagnitude of the differences in economic well-being across cities, states and nations –\ndifferences that stem directly from decades of historical differences in growth rates – can\nbe staggering. Indeed, one prominent economist has written that once one starts to think\nabout these differences, “it is hard to think about anything else.” 3\nPolicymakers at the national, state and local levels generally look for ways to enhance\neconomic growth in their jurisdictions. In keeping with our status as a nonpartisan\ninstitution, Federal Reserve officials tend to avoid commenting on controversial policy\nproposals, especially when such policies benefit some but disadvantage others. On such\nissues, I prefer to restrict myself to pointing out what economists know about a policy’s\ncosts and benefits that may have been overlooked in the public debate. On many issues,\nthe economics of the question are not decisive, though economics does tend to spotlight\nthe often-overlooked costs associated with many otherwise seemingly attractive ideas.\nOn some questions, however, economic research sends a fairly clear message. I believe\nthat early childhood development is such an issue. I will elaborate in my remarks here\nthis morning on why I believe this to be the case, but simply stated, my position is that if\ngovernment is going to invest in education at all, it should invest in enhancing early\n\n\fchildhood development. For me, this is an economic growth issue. The continual\nenhancement of skills over time is essential to sustained growth in economic well-being,\nand research indicates that early childhood development is critical to the life-long\ndevelopment of skills. I need to mention at the outset, however, that although my views\non early childhood development owe much to what I have learned from my colleagues in\nthe Federal Reserve System, my remarks represent my own personal views.\nI come to this conclusion from an understanding of the economics of growth. A moment\nago, I mentioned the disparities in economic well-being across regions. At any point in\ntime, some nations, states and cities are wealthier, per capita, than others, and over time,\nsome grow faster than others. Efforts by economists to account for these differences in\ngrowth point pretty convincingly in one direction – human capital, that is, the skills,\nabilities and knowledge people possess.\nNow it probably sounds like simple common sense to say that a person’s economic wellbeing is related to the economic value of their skills. And while skills are difficult to\nmeasure precisely, the measures we do have – on levels of education and work\nexperience, for instance – show that people with these characteristics tend to have\nsignificantly higher incomes. I’ll have more to say later on about the relationship between\nskills and income at the level of the individual worker or household. But first, I want to\ntalk about the role of human capital in the broader phenomenon of economic growth,\nparticularly at the level of regions within the United States.\nData on the growth of income per person across the United States and across cities and\nmetropolitan areas reveals that at least one important measure of skills is consistently\ncorrelated with future growth. That measure is education, and a typical finding is that the\nshare of the population of a U.S. city or state that had a college degree in 1990 is\npositively associated with growth in family income between 1990 and 2000. 4 In other\nwords, the more highly educated the population, the greater the subsequent growth in\neconomic well-being. Furthermore, population growth in U.S. cities and metropolitan\nareas is correlated with education levels, suggesting that places with highly skilled\npopulations create opportunities that attract newcomers. Similar results have been found\nin research that covers different time periods and different geographical designations (for\nexample, cross-country analyses).\nThe link between an area’s level of educational attainment at a point in time and its\nsubsequent growth suggests that the relationship could be causal – that having a greater\nskills base enables an area to grow faster. Causality is sometimes hard to establish, and a\ngreat deal of research has been aimed at this question. While such research often is not as\nconclusive as one would hope, I think it is fair for us to take as a lesson from the\nscientific literature that human capital is an important determinant of a region’s economic\ngrowth.\nNote that it is not obvious that the average level of human capital in a region should be\nrelated to future economic growth. One would expect higher average skill levels to be\nassociated with higher current income, but one might expect regions to grow thereafter at\n\n2\n\n\fthe same rate, independent of their starting point. 5 What is striking about the empirical\nevidence is that higher current skill levels predict faster future growth, all else equal. One\npossible interpretation of this fact is that skills, in addition to boosting current income,\nenhance an area’s ability to further build its skill base – “human capital begets more\nhuman capital,” you might say. Economists have identified two distinct ways this might\ncome about. One is the straightforward notion that certain general skills make people\nbetter at learning new skills. Another involves what economists call “externalities” or\n“increasing returns,” meaning that a skilled worker is more productive in a marketplace\nor work environment with other skilled workers. The basic idea is simple, though: there is\na bonus when you invest in human capital – you get greater productivity in producing\ngoods and in producing more human capital.\nThe idea that human capital promotes growth is, perhaps, not too surprising. After all,\nand as I mentioned earlier, it’s quite natural to think of differences in skills as explaining\na substantial part of the differences in income between individual people – why shouldn’t\nthis logic extend to communities, cities, states, and so on? At the level of individual\nworkers, in fact, there is abundant evidence that the importance of skill to one’s economic\nwell-being has grown over the last several decades. This is seen in a growing gap\nbetween the average wages earned by high school graduates and those with college or\nadvanced degrees.\nThe growth in this pay differential, or “skill premium,” is a major factor behind the\nincrease in income inequality that has received so much attention of late. The apparent\nreasons for this widening dispersion are germane here. Wages paid to workers at any\nparticular skill level generally reflect how productive those workers are – how much\neconomic value their work creates. If the wages of higher-skilled workers have grown\nmore rapidly than the wages of the less-skilled, then it must be the case that the work\nenvironment has changed in a way that has made the productivity of higher-skilled\nworkers rise more rapidly.\nOne change that has had a tremendous effect on the way people work in recent decades is\nthe application of information technology. And this change appears to have had differing\neffects on the productivities and wages of workers at different skill levels. It’s become\ncommonplace to talk about jobs that have been replaced by automation. These tend to be\nrelatively low-skilled jobs – involving tasks that you can program a machine to perform,\nfor example. On the other hand, jobs that require judgment and adaptability to changing\nconditions do not lend themselves as easily to automation. In fact, the application of\ninformation technology is likely to enhance the effectiveness of people in such jobs by\nrelieving them of routine aspects of their jobs.\nSo technological change has enhanced the productivity of high-skilled workers relative to\nlow-skilled workers – economists call this “skill-biased technological change.” It can be\nthought of as a shift in demand from low- to high-skilled workers. The resulting increase\nin the wage premium associated with higher levels of workplace skills provides an\nincentive for workers to acquire more education and skills. And college enrollments have\nbeen trending up, which would tend to increase the relative supply of skilled workers and\n\n3\n\n\fdampen the increase in the skill premium. The fact that the skill premium has continued\nto rise essentially means that the (relative) supply of higher skilled workers has not kept\npace with demand.\nIt is worth noting that the skills that have become most valuable over time seem to be the\ngeneral types of skills that come with higher levels of education – as opposed to the very\nspecific skills that one can gain through experience in a particular job or occupation. This\nis an important distinction. It means that moreso than ever before, the path to economic\nsuccess lies in education rather than in on-the-job work experience. And if these sorts of\ngeneral skills are the key to success, it follows that a lack of skills presents a formidable\nbarrier to success – for an individual, a community, a state or a nation.\nBuilding a skilled workforce requires investments at several levels, and one important\npublic policy question involves getting the right mix of public and private responsibilities\nfor those investments. After all, the evidence that education pays off in the form of higher\nlifetime wages means that people should have a strong private incentive to invest in their\nown skills.\nBut there are good reasons why relying on individuals to finance their own investments in\nhuman capital might not be sufficient. One is that, as I alluded to earlier, an individual’s\neducation benefits society at large, beyond the individual’s increased earning power.\nEconomists call this type of broader benefit an “externality,” and the traditional case for\npublic funding of education at various levels rests in part on such effects.\nUp to now, I’ve been talking about the role of human capital and investment in skills in\nthe process of economic growth. Let me summarize the general points. Skills are a key\ndeterminant of individual economic well-being and broader economic growth. Recent\ntrends in technology have amplified the importance of skills, especially the general skills\nthat come from education through the post-secondary level. And there are good reasons\nfor people’s own financing of human capital investments to be supplemented by public\nsupport.\nWhat does this have to do with early childhood? I mentioned earlier that acquiring skills\nimproves one’s ability to subsequently acquire further skills. Could this logic extend back\nto the earliest investments in human capital – those that occur between birth and age 5? I\nbelieve the evidence indicates that the answer is “yes.”\nSpecifically, there is substantial evidence that differences in early childhood treatment\nhave long-lasting effects in school performance as well as in a variety of other indicators\nof social success.6 Some of these findings come from studies of experimental or pilot\nprograms in which children receiving different early educational experiences were\ntracked over a long time. Two of the most famous of these studies are Michigan’s Perry\nPreschool Project and North Carolina’s Abecedarian Program. The Perry Preschool\nProject began with a sample of children from low-income families in the 1960s and has\nfollowed their experiences well into adulthood. The study featured random assignment –\nhalf of the sample population was placed in a high-quality preschool program and half\n\n4\n\n\fwas not. Random assignment greatly enhances our confidence in the validity of the\nfindings, because it minimizes the extent to which different outcomes may be due to\nextraneous differences in sample groups. The Abecedarian Program, begun in the 1970s,\nalso featured random assignment and the assessment of outcomes over a long period –\nthrough age 21.\nIn both of these studies, program participants were found to show greater success along a\nnumber of dimensions. They generally completed more years of schooling, showed better\nscores on standardized tests, and were less likely to need special education services. In\naddition, participants had lower rates of involvement in crime and out-of-wedlock births,\nand higher rates of employment and home ownership – this last indicator being specific\nto the Perry Preschool Project, which followed participants to age 40. In very broad\nterms, then, the average participant had a demonstrably better life than the typical\nmember of the control group. Such striking results appear to give convincing evidence\nthat well-targeted, high-quality early childhood services can yield benefits well in excess\nof their costs.\nIn addition to these and other relatively small studies, a number of somewhat larger\nstudies suggest that the benefits from quality early childhood education can be realized\non a larger scale and that the results of studies like Abecedarian and Perry were not\nmerely due to the specific communities in which they were conducted. For example, a\nstudy in Chicago examined the educational and social experiences of nearly a thousand\nChicago youths from poor households across the city, some of whom had and some of\nwhom had not participated in the Chicago Child Parent Centers Program when they were\nvery young. As with the other studies, those having received the early childhood\ntreatment showed better educational attainment and lower incidence of delinquency and\nother social problems.\nThe association in these studies between enhanced early childhood environments and\nimproved life outcomes appears to be consistent with the emerging understanding of the\ndependence of a child’s early brain development on their exposure to intellectual\nstimulation, but that topic is a good deal beyond my area of expertise.\nIt is worth noting that there are aspects of early childhood development programs that\ndeserve further research. The most convincing results come from small programs targeted\nat particular at-risk populations. One would expect the benefits of such programs to be\ngreatest for these populations. Returns might be less dramatic for more universal\nprograms, since presumably they would include more children who are likely to succeed\nwithout a program. Details of program implementation deserve further scrutiny as well.\nIn particular, the skills and training of the staff seem to be important to a program’s\nsuccess, which suggests paying close attention to the design of appropriate qualifications\nand standards for early childhood education professionals. All this implies that broader\ninvestments in early childhood education should allow for experimentation with\nalternative programmatic models, and should be accompanied by continuing research that\ntracks the experiences of participating children over time.\n\n5\n\n\fEconomists like to think about investment in terms of rate of return, and there is reason to\nthink that the rate of return on early childhood investment could be particularly high. In\nfact, Art Rolnick and Rob Grunewald of the Minneapolis Fed have used the results of the\nPerry Preschool Project to estimate that the average annual inflation-adjusted rate of\nreturn on investments in early childhood education, targeted to at-risk populations, is in\nthe neighborhood of 16 percent.7 This compares very favorably with real rates of return\nimplied by financial markets of around 3 percent, for instance, on long term Treasury\nsecurities. Like any investment in human capital, some of the return accrues directly to\nthe individual in the form of increased life-time earning ability. But a substantial share of\nthe return – perhaps as much as three-quarters of the total – is a broader, social benefit,\ncoming from such sources as reduced costs of remediation and other special services in\nprimary and secondary school, as well as from the reduced incidence of the array of\nsocial problems often associated with low educational achievement.\nThere are many explanations for the apparent high economic returns to early childhood\neducation, but let me briefly highlight one. A key difference between early childhood\ninvestments and investments at primary and secondary education levels is the potential\nfor compounding that I mentioned earlier. That is, enhancing early childhood\ndevelopment appears to improve a child’s ability to learn at later stages. This means that\nthe return on early education comes not just from the direct effects, say on the\ndevelopment of cognitive ability, but also from the fact that these early investments\nincrease the productivity of later educational investments. This is a point the Nobel prizewinning economist James Heckman has emphasized in his writing on early childhood\neducation.8\nThis compounding effect means that disparities in early childhood development have the\npotential to exacerbate inequality within our society. People with limited means are more\nlikely to have difficulty providing their children with a high-quality early childhood\nenvironment, leaving those children less able to benefit from later investments in human\ncapital. This possibility creates, I believe, a legitimate public interest in helping people of\nmodest means find and afford quality early childhood education. It holds the promise of\nexpanding the development of human capital more broadly across our society and in so\ndoing, widening our potential for skill-based economic growth.\nSo I tend to think of the benefits of early childhood education as providing children in\nless-advantaged families and less-developed communities with better preparation for\nacquiring the education and skills that expand economic opportunity. For decades,\nsubstantial efforts have been made to improve economic outcomes for disadvantaged\npopulations by enhancing access to formal educational institutions. The widening of the\nskill premium in recent decades demonstrates that those efforts have had only limited\nsuccess, and widespread evidence indicates that variations in per-pupil spending have\nonly limited effects. Parental inputs into a child’s education, on the other hand, explain a\nsubstantial portion of the variation in educational preparedness and outcomes.9 The\npromise of early childhood education is that it can begin to address disparities in\neducational outcomes, and thus economic outcomes, at a more fundamental level.\n\n6\n\n\fHaving said all that, I should note that the problems facing disadvantaged communities –\nproblems that limit the realization of human capital potential – are multifaceted, and no\none policy initiative offers a panacea. This is not the place to survey the broader array of\nchallenges in such communities. I do believe, however, that the new attention to early\nchildhood development presents a unique opportunity in the area of public policy aimed\nat economic development. By broadening the development of human capital, early\nchildhood education can add to our capacity for growth while also creating opportunities\nfor the benefits of that growth to be shared more broadly.\n1\n\nI have benefited from the help of John Weinberg in preparing this speech, though I remain solely\nresponsible for the contents.\n2\nJeffrey M.

            "content": "The Inflation Outlook\nMurray Financial Group\nFrederick, MD\nJune 6, 2007\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nI am very pleased to be with you today to discuss my views on the economic\noutlook, with particular emphasis on the outlook for inflation.1 In its most recent\nstatements, the Federal Open Market Committee has identified “the risk that\ninflation will fail to moderate as expected” as its “predominant policy concern.”\nThis places current inflation and the inflation outlook squarely at center stage in\nthinking about the economy and monetary policy. So in my remarks today, I will\ntake a closer look at inflation’s recent behavior and the prospects for its future\nbehavior. In doing so, I’ll discuss the interplay between real activity and inflation\nexpectations. As always, these remarks should be taken as my own personal\nviews, and not necessarily those of any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\nRecent Inflation\nTo put the current situation in context, recall that under Chairman Paul Volcker\nthe FOMC brought inflation down to below 4 percent in the mid-1980s.\n(Throughout my remarks today, unless otherwise noted, I will be referring to\ninflation measured by the 12-month growth rate in the price index for core\npersonal consumption expenditures.) Under Chairman Alan Greenspan, core\ninflation fluctuated between 3½ percent and 5 percent until 1992, but fell to near 2\npercent in 1994, and below 2 percent in March 1996. Inflation then remained\nbetween 1 percent and 2 percent more or less continuously until April 2004. The\nexception was several months during the second half of 2001 as the economy\nslipped into a recession.2 For those years, core PCE inflation averaged 1.6\npercent, and was between 1 percent and 2 percent for more than 90 percent of the\ntime.\nIn early 2003 inflation fell, and for some months inflation was reported to be\nbelow 1 percent at an annual rate.3 This led to concern about the possibility of\nexcessive disinflation, and in response the FOMC statement at the May meeting\ncited the risk of “an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation.” At the June 2003\nmeeting, the FOMC reduced the target federal funds rate to 1 percent. While the\nCommittee had not then, and has not since, established an explicit numerical\ntarget range for inflation, the May 2003 statement was taken to many observers as\nestablishing an implicit lower bound on the range of inflation rates the Committee\nwould find acceptable.4\n\n\fCore inflation has increased since 2003. It rose to more than 2 percent in April\n2004, and has fluctuated between 2 percent and 2.4 percent ever since. Monthly\nreadings have exhibited wider swings recently, and 12-month inflation has\nfluctuated accordingly, falling to 2.1 percent in November but then rising 2.4\npercent again for February. The most recent reading, for April, came in at\n2.0.percent. But given the repeated swings we’ve seen, it is difficult to pick out a\ndefinite trend, and in fact, no statistically significant moderating trend has\nemerged yet, an issue I will say more about later in my talk. About all one can say\nwith confidence is that year-over-year core inflation is now fluctuating around 2¼\npercent.\nChairman Ben Bernanke, in his March 28 testimony to the Joint Economic\nCommittee, said about core inflation that “recent readings have been somewhat\nelevated and the level of core inflation remains uncomfortably high.” In addition,\nI and several other FOMC participants have expressed dissatisfaction with the\ncurrent level of inflation. Even though, as I noted earlier, the Committee has not\nestablished an explicit numerical objective or range for inflation, some observers\nhave taken recent comments as indicating an upper bound on the range of desired\ninflation rates, analogous to the way the Committee’s May 2003 statement was\ntaken as marking a lower bound on the Committee’s desired inflation rate.\nThe central question, then, regarding the outlook for inflation is whether core\ninflation will “moderate” to an acceptable rate in coming quarters? Some\nforecasters are expecting inflation to decline this year and next, and many of them\nlink this decline to the expectation that real growth has been weak and is expected\nto remain below trend over the next few quarters. So let me review some\nimportant components of final demand.\nReal Activity\nHousing construction is the component of aggregate output that has\nunderstandably attracted the most attention lately. The recent weakness followed\na decade-long period of sustained growth in housing activity, which was driven\nby favorable fundamental factors such as: improving prospects for real income\ngrowth, unusually low inflation-adjusted mortgage interest rates, increasing\npopulation, and the favorable tax treatment of owner-occupied housing. By the\nend of 2005, though, demand appeared to have been largely satiated in most local\nmarkets. Since then, although some markets continue to show steady growth,\nmany markets have seen sharp reductions in construction and homes sales and a\nslowdown in housing price appreciation. Indeed, in some locations prices have\nbegun to decline. The fact that housing data are typically somewhat noisier in\nwinter months is making it difficult to gauge whether housing demand has\nreached bottom as yet. Even if it has, however, the need to work off an overhang\nof new homes inventories is likely to depress new construction spending for\nseveral months to come.\n\n2\n\n\fOne prominent feature of the expansion of housing activity was a dramatic\nadvance in lending to subprime borrowers, and the recent increase in\ndelinquencies and defaults in this sector has raised concerns. This is not the time\nfor a thorough review of the subprime mortgage market – that would be a separate\nspeech.5 If you’re interested, Chairman Bernanke just gave an excellent one. All\nthings considered, macroeconomic effects of recent developments in the subprime\nmarket are likely to be relatively limited, and I do not expect any significant\nspillovers to the rest of the economy.\nBusiness investment spending has been an impressive source of strength over\nmuch of this expansion. Real spending on equipment and software increased at a\nhealthy 8.7 percent annual rate from the first quarter of 2003 to the first quarter of\n2006. Spending on structures picked up at the end of 2005, increasing 14 percent\nin the four quarters ending in Q3. Business investment faltered late last year\nthough, with weaker sales of autos and construction materials apparently playing\nimportant roles. Most of the fundamentals for business investment are still quite\npositive, however; profitability is high, the cost of capital is fairly low, and funds\nfor new investment are readily available on favorable terms. Thus I expect\ninvestment to re-gain momentum this year. Indeed, we are already seeing some\nencouraging signs that this is taking place.\nGrowth in consumer spending has been another source of strength in this\neconomic expansion. That growth has been underpinned by solid real income\ngrowth during the recovery and favorable prospects for future income growth.\nMany observers hypothesized that the drag from weakening housing markets\nwould spill over and dampen consumer spending. That hasn’t happened. Last year\nreal consumer spending rose 3.6 percent, and in the first quarter it increased at a\n3.8 percent annual rate.\nSome observers have questioned the outlook for consumer spending, often citing\nstatistics that lead them to believe that consumer debt is too high or consumer\nsaving is too low. I won’t argue with the data – by the usual measures saving is\nquite low, with the widely cited personal saving rate clocking in at negative 1\npercent for the first quarter. But keep in mind that the personal saving rate has\nbeen on a downward trend from about 10 percent in the early 1980s to about\nminus 1 percent now. A number of forces could potentially be at play here,\nincluding, for example, the significant credit market innovations that have taken\nplace over that period.6 I understand how historical averages can exert a\ngravitational pull on the forecasts of variables like the saving rate, and I don’t\nbelieve the downward trend is likely to persist indefinitely. But having said that,\nits not obvious to me why we should expect that long-term trend to reverse itself\nbeginning precisely next quarter.\nAn alternative perspective on savings and consumption is that the strong recent\ngrowth in household spending indicates optimism about future income prospects,\nrather than any fundamental recklessness. And there are good reasons for\n\n3\n\n\fhouseholds to be relatively optimistic. The labor market is reasonably tight, with\nthe unemployment rate at 4.5.percent. Average earnings are growing at about a 4\npercent rate. Employment growth has slowed a bit from the above average pace of\nthe last several years, but still continues to be rapid enough to absorb the ongoing\ngrowth we expect in the labor force. Prospects for real income growth, then, look\npretty solid. Moreover, household net worth is up to 5¾ percent years of\ndisposable personal income, and has been rising during this recovery, which\nsuggests that savings, properly measured, might not be so low after all. As\nalways, real wage growth will tend to track gains in labor productivity, and while\nproductivity growth was fairly strong for the first several years of this decade, the\nrecent slowdown is a negative risk for consumer spending. On balance, though, I\nexpect consumer spending to remain reasonably healthy.\nPutting this all together, I expect overall growth to come in below trend in the first\nhalf of this year, but to return to trend by the end of the year, based on my\nexpectation that the housing market is likely to find a bottom some time this year\nand no longer be a drag on top line growth, business investment will pick up, and\nconsumer spending will remain healthy.\nThe Phillips Curve\nAs I mentioned earlier, many commentators base their belief that inflation will\nmoderate on their belief that output growth will be below trend for the next few\nquarters. This connection is based on a popular – though I will argue incomplete\nand potentially misleading – understanding of the relationship between inflation\nand real economic activity. This relationship is usually described by the “Phillips\ncurve,” which typically shows an inverse relationship between inflation and\nunemployment or the “output gap.”7 One way of thinking about the Phillips curve\nis to see it as describing a set of options facing policymakers – as if to say, “You\ncan have less inflation with more unemployment or less unemployment with more\ninflation.”\nModern monetary economics now understands the relationship between inflation\nand real activity differently. In the new version of the Phillips curve, current\ninflation is related to expected future inflation as well an indicator of current\neconomic activity, such as unemployment or the “output gap.” But to state it this\nway – as an equation with inflation on the left hand side depending on a real\nvariable plus inflation expectations on the right hand side – is entirely arbitrary.\nOne could just as well write the relationship the other way and say that\nunemployment, for example, depends on inflation and expected inflation.\nIn fact, what we know is that inflation and real economic activity are the joint\noutcome of decentralized decisions, made by participants in the economy,\nregarding demand, supply, prices and wages. So it is just as correct (or rather\nincorrect) to say below-trend growth will drive inflation down, as it is to say that\nfalling inflation will keep growth below trend. Because inflation ultimately\n\n4\n\n\fdepends on the actions of the central bank, those decentralized decisions will\ndepend on past, present and expected future central bank policy choices. Thus it is\ncentral banks, not the labor market, that drive inflation down.\nThe behavior of inflation expectations is vitally important to a central bank that is\nattempting to reduce inflation. If inflation expectations are low and consistent\nwith the reduction in inflation that the central bank wishes to bring about, it will\nbe important to assure that they do not drift higher during the disinflation process.\nIf inflation expectations have become elevated, a sustained reduction in inflation\nwill require bringing inflation expectations down as well.\nInflation expectations embody assumptions –either explicit or implicit –about\nhow the central bank is going to conduct monetary policy in the future. Public\nunderstanding of the central bank’s long-run goals and of how the central bank\nwould respond to various potential economic disturbances helps anchor inflation\nexpectations.\n\nInflation Expectations\nIf inflation expectations are a key determinant of the inflation outlook, then what\ndo we know about the recent behavior of inflation expectations? There are a\nvariety of indicators and as you might expect, none of them is perfect. Survey\nmeasures have the longest track record. The Philadelphia Fed compiles and\npublishes the Survey of Professional Forecasters every quarter. Their most recent\ncompilation, published just last week, reports a mean expectation for core PCE\ninflation of 2.1 percent through the end of 2009. You may also have heard of the\nBlue Chip forecasters survey. Their average forecast for core CPI inflation (not\nPCE inflation) is 2.4 percent in 2007, and 2.3 percent in 2008, The CPI and the\nPCE inflation indexes are based on slightly different methodologies, and they tend\nto differ by about four-tenths on average. So the Blue Chip forecast of 2.4 percent\nand 2.3 percent for CPI translates into 2.0 percent and 1.9 percent respectively for\nthe core PCE, a bit lower than the Philadelphia survey. Consumer surveys, in\ncontrast, yield much higher figures. Among respondents to the Reuters University of Michigan survey, the median expected inflation over the next year\nis 3.2 percent and the median expected inflation over the next ten years is\n3.1.percent. Economists typically discount data from such consumer surveys in\nwhich respondents have little or no economic incentive to forecast well.\nProfessional forecasters presumably perceive a pecuniary benefit to having a\ndocumented record of accuracy. So I would favor the figures obtained from\nprofessional forecasters. Better yet would be readings on inflation expectations\nderived from traded market instruments. Fortunately, such measures can be\nderived from the spreads between indexed and non-indexed U.S. Treasury\nsecurities –the so-called TIPS spread. The implied expectation of CPI inflation\nover the next five years was around 1½ percent in early 2003, rose to near 2½\npercent in 2004, and has been trading around 2.3 percent in recent weeks. Taking\n\n5\n\n\foff four-tenths for the average PCE-CPI spread, this translates to around 1.9\npercent.\nAnother place to look for evidence on inflation trends is the growth in labor\ncompensation. Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector accelerated\nfrom below 4 percent in 2005 to 5 percent in 2006. This is consistent with the\nbroad acceleration in average hourly earnings shown in the Employment Report,\nand the upswing in the Employment Cost Index. Inflation-adjusted compensation\ngains should (and generally do) track labor productivity gains fairly closely. This\nis algebraically equivalent to saying that the markup over unit labor costs should\nbe fairly constant. If so, the growth in unit labor costs should provide a gauge of\nexpected inflation trends, the idea being that workers and firms set current wages\nbased on their near-term expectations for real productivity gains and inflation.\nProductivity growth was relatively high early in this decade, but has decelerated\nrecently and averaged 1.6 percent last year. As a result, unit labor costs have\naccelerated and have averaged 2.4 percent over the last two years. The markup\nhas been relatively steady at an elevated level over those two years, which with\nrising unit labor costs is consistent with the rise in inflation we’ve seen.\nIf unit labor costs continue to advance at recent rates, either inflation will keep\npace with unit labor costs, or the increase in labor costs will be absorbed by firms\nlowering their markups. It is true that the aggregate markup implied by the\nproductivity and unit labor cost numbers has been high by historical standards,\nwhich accords well with the recent strength in business profits, but our\nunderstanding of aggregate movements in the markup is limited. The markup has\ntended to revert to its mean, but it can deviate for long stretches of time. So while\nit is possible that the markup might fall to offset a rise in unit labor costs, if we\ndon’t know why the markup is elevated now, its hard to have much confidence in\na forecast that it is going to come to our rescue just in the nick of time. If the\nmarkup remains relatively high, and unit labor costs continue to advance at or\nabove 2 percent, then we are likely to see inflation continue at about 2 percent.\nCorroborating evidence on inflation expectations is provided by recent work by\nJames Stock and Mark Watson.8 They estimate a model of postwar US inflation\nthat allows them to decompose inflation into “trend” and “transitory”\ncomponents, each with their own time-varying volatility. The time-varying\nvolatility feature allows for changes over time in the portion of the variability in\ninflation that is due to long-lasting swings in trend inflation, as we saw in the\nGreat Inflation of the 1970s, as opposed to short-run transitory movements in\ninflation. They find that the variability in the trend component of inflation has\nfallen dramatically since the 1970s, consistent with other research that has\ndocumented a fall in the “persistence” of inflation since then.9\nStock and Watson’s methodology implies that the best forecast for future inflation\nis the current estimated value of the trend component, which their method puts at\n2.1 percent (for core PCE inflation) as of the first quarter of 2007. This measure\n\n6\n\n\fof trend inflation has been above 2 since the fourth quarter of 2004, and peaked at\n2.2 percent in the second quarter of 2006. Interestingly, their measure of trend\nwas between 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent for over eight straight years from 1996 to\n2003.\nThe Stock and Watson framework provides a natural way to assess whether any\nmoderation in core inflation is evident yet. Their measure of trend inflation fell by\n6 basis points from the peak (2.17 percent) in the second quarter of last year to the\nfirst quarter of 2007 (2.11 percent). Given the shape of the probability distribution\naround their estimates, this decline does not appear to be statistically significant.\nInflation Outlook\nA variety of expectations measures then, point to expectations for core PCE\ninflation of about 2 percent right now. What does this imply about the outlook for\nactual inflation? The current level of inflation expectations is likely to exert a\ngravitational pull on actual inflation, provided that monetary policy actions are\nnot inconsistent with those expectations and no concerted effort is made to shift\nexpectations. Policy actions at variance with those expectations –for example,\nsignificant easing at a time of elevated or rising inflation –would likely call those\nexpectations into question and lead to a change in assessments regarding future\ninflation. But as long as policy actions appear to be plausibly consistent with\nmovement toward 2 percent inflation and nothing else acts to alter inflation\nexpectations, that’s likely to be the best forecast for where inflation is headed.\nCould inflation fall below 2 percent, say to 1½ percent? That depends. Without a\nprompt fall in inflation expectations, a reduction in inflation below 2 percent is\nlikely to be temporary and hard to sustain. With expectations left alone, that is, if\nnothing is done to try to shift expectations, the remaining mechanism for bringing\ndown inflation is the old-fashioned Phillips curve mechanism, that is, an increase\nin real interest rates that slows aggregate demand and reduces both inflation and\nreal activity. This could be costly in terms of foregone real growth.\nThe prospects for bringing inflation down below 2 percent thus hinge on the\nextent to which a reduction in inflation expectations can be brought about. How\ndifficult would that be? Using changes in the target interest rate alone, the process\nis likely to be difficult and time-consuming.\nOne natural approach to bringing inflation expectations down more expeditiously,\nshould that be the desire, would be a strategy of clear communications about\npolicymakers’ intentions. Just how responsive would inflation expectations be to\nsuch communications? General conclusions are unlikely, because the results will\ndepend on the nature of communications, the nature of the accompanying actions,\nand the context in which they are received. There are many historical examples of\nsignificant shifts in monetary policy expectations; examples include the fiscal\nreforms accompanying the ends of hyperinflations, the governance changes\n\n7\n\n\faccompanying the adoption of explicit inflation objectives in other countries, and\nthe operational regime shift adopted by the Volcker FOMC in 1979.\nThese examples involved fairly dramatic and sizable shifts in the conduct of\nmonetary policy, however. Shifting inflation expectations from 2 percent down to\n1.5 percent or 1 percent represents a far smaller change in policy, and thus ought\nto be less difficult. In fact, exactly the opposite transition was made 3 years ago.\nAs I noted earlier, core inflation was between 1 and 2 percent from 1996 through\nearly 2004, and then since early 2004 core inflation has been between 2 and 2½\npercent. Inflation expectations seem to have shifted up accordingly; for example\nthe TIPS spread was around 1½ percent in 2003. The fact that core inflation so\nrecently spent eight years between 1 and 2 percent suggests that convincing the\npublic that we were returning to such a period would not be that difficult,\nespecially in light of the fact that the Committee did not, during that earlier\nperiod, announce an intention to keep core inflation within that band.\nIn many recent instances, FOMC actions or statements appear to have induced\nsimultaneous short-run movements in market participants’ expectations regarding\nthe path of the federal funds rate and inflation. For example, following the heavy\nhurricane season of 2005, and during the spring of 2006 in response to energy\nprice increases, inflation expectations rose, but were subsequently tamped down\nby Committee member communications. In both cases, the movement in inflation\nexpectations was relatively contained, but these short run spikes suggest a\npliability of inflation expectations in the current environment.\nThe outlook for inflation, then, is to an important extent contingent on the extent\nto which it appears worthwhile to engineer a reduction in inflation expectations,\nto return them to a level more closely consistent with our price stability mandate.\nIn any event, there is little disagreement about the central importance of inflation\nexpectations for the conduct of monetary policy and the outlook for inflation.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThis speech is an abridged version of a speech given on May 22, 2007.

            "content": "The Inflation Outlook\nMoney Marketeers of New York University\nNew York, N.Y.\nMay 22, 2007\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nI am pleased to be with you tonight to discuss my views on the outlook for inflation. 1 In\nits most recent statements, the Federal Open Market Committee has identified “the risk\nthat inflation will fail to moderate as expected” as its “predominant policy concern.” This\nplaces current inflation and the inflation outlook squarely at center stage in thinking\nabout the economy and monetary policy. So in my remarks tonight, I will take a closer\nlook at inflation’s recent behavior and the prospects for its future behavior. In doing so,\nI’ll place particular emphasis on what we’ve learned in recent years about inflation\ndynamics, particularly the interplay between real activity and inflation expectations. As\nalways, these remarks should be taken as my own personal views, and not necessarily\nshared by any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\nRecent Inflation\nTo put the current situation in context, recall that under Chairman Paul Volcker, the\nFOMC brought inflation down to below 4 percent in the mid-1980s. (Throughout my\nremarks tonight, unless otherwise noted, I will be referring to inflation measured by the\n12-month growth rate in the monthly price index for core personal consumption\nexpenditures.) Under Chairman Alan Greenspan, core inflation fluctuated between 3½\npercent and 5 percent until 1992, but fell to near 2 percent in 1994, and below 2 percent\nin March 1996. Inflation then remained between 1 percent and 2 percent more or less\ncontinuously until April 2004. The exception was several months during the second half\nof 2001 as the economy slipped into a recession. 2 From 1996 through 2003, a period of\neight years, core PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent, and was between 1 and 2 percent 90\npercent of the time.\nIn early 2003, inflation fell, and for some months inflation was reported to be below 1\npercent at an annual rate. 3 This led to concern about the possibility of excessive\ndisinflation, and in response, the FOMC statement at the May meeting cited the risk of\n“an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation,” and at the June 2003 meeting, the FOMC\nreduced the target federal funds rate to 1 percent. While the Committee had not then, and\nhas not since, established an explicit numerical target range for inflation, the May 2003\nstatement was taken to many observers as establishing an implicit lower bound on the\nrange of inflation rates the Committee would find acceptable. 4\nCore inflation has increased since 2003. From a low of 1.3 percent for the 12 months\nending in September 2003, it rose to more than 2 percent in April 2004, and has\nfluctuated between 2 percent and 2.4 percent ever since. Monthly readings have exhibited\nwider swings in recent months, and 12-month inflation has fluctuated accordingly, falling\nto 2.1 percent in November but then rising 2.4 percent again for February. (Translating\nthe April CPI report suggests that core PCE inflation will step up to 2.2 percent.) Given\nthese repeated swings, it is not surprising that it is difficult to pick out a definite trend,\n\n\fand in fact, no statistically significant moderating trend has emerged yet, an issue I will\nreturn to later in my talk. About all one can say with confidence is that core inflation is\nnow fluctuating around 2¼ percent.\nChairman Ben Bernanke, in his March 28 testimony to the Joint Economic Committee,\nsaid about core inflation that “recent readings have been somewhat elevated and the level\nof core inflation remains uncomfortably high.” In addition, I and several other FOMC\nparticipants have expressed dissatisfaction with the current level of inflation. Even\nthough, as I noted earlier, the Committee has not established an explicit numerical\nobjective or range for inflation, some observers have taken recent comments as indicating\nan upper bound on the range of desired inflation rates, analogous to the way the\nCommittee’s May 2003 statement was taken as marking a lower bound.\nThe central question, then, regarding the outlook for inflation is whether core inflation\nwill “moderate” to an acceptable rate in coming quarters. Some forecasters are expecting\ninflation to decline this year and next, and many of them link this decline to the\nexpectation that real growth has been weak and is expected to remain below trend over\nthe next few quarters. The relationship between real activity and the inflation outlook,\nwhich I will discuss in more detail later on, is important enough to warrant a look at\nselected components of final demand.\nReal Activity\nHousing construction is the component of aggregate output that has understandably\nattracted the most attention lately. The recent weakness followed a decade-long period of\nsustained growth in housing activity, which was driven by favorable fundamental factors,\nsuch as improving prospects for real income growth, unusually low inflation-adjusted\nmortgage interest rates, increasing population, and the favorable tax treatment of owneroccupied housing. By the end of 2005, though, demand appeared to have been largely\nsatiated in most local markets. Since then, although some markets continue to show\nsteady growth, many markets have seen sharp reductions in construction and homes sales,\nand a slowdown in housing price appreciation. Indeed, in some locations prices have\nbegun to decline. The fact that housing data are typically somewhat noisier in winter\nmonths is making it difficult to gauge whether housing demand has reached bottom as\nyet. Even if it has, however, the need to work off an overhang of new homes inventories\nis likely to depress new construction spending for several months to come.\nOne prominent feature of the expansion of housing activity was a dramatic advance in\nlending to subprime borrowers, and the recent increase in delinquencies and defaults in\nthis sector has raised concerns. This is not the time for a thorough review of the subprime\nmortgage market – that would be a separate speech. 5 All things considered, the\nmacroeconomic effects of recent developments in the subprime market are likely to be\nrelatively limited, and I do not expect any significant spillovers to the rest of the\neconomy.\n\n2\n\n\fBusiness investment spending has been an impressive source of strength over much of\nthis expansion. Real spending on equipment and software increased at a healthy 8.7\npercent annual rate from the first quarter of 2003 to the first quarter of 2006. Spending on\nstructures picked up at the end of 2005, increasing 14 percent in the four quarters ending\nin Q3. Business investment faltered late last year though, with weaker sales of autos and\nconstruction materials apparently playing important roles. Most of the fundamentals for\nbusiness investment are still quite positive, however; profitability is high, the cost of\ncapital is fairly low, and funds for new investment are readily available on favorable\nterms. Thus I expect investment to gain momentum this year, and we are already seeing\nsome favorable signs.\nGrowth in consumer spending has been another source of strength in this economic\nexpansion. That growth has been underpinned by solid real income growth during the\nrecovery and favorable prospects for future income growth. Many observers\nhypothesized that the drag from weakening housing markets would spill over and dampen\nconsumer spending. That hasn’t happened. Last year, real consumer spending rose 3.6\npercent, and in the first quarter it increased at a 3.8 percent annual rate.\nSome observers have questioned the outlook for consumer spending, often citing\nstatistics that lead them to believe that consumer debt is too high or consumer saving is\ntoo low. I won’t argue with the data – by the usual measures saving is quite low, with the\nwidely cited personal saving rate clocking in at negative 1 percent for the first quarter.\nBut keep in mind that the personal saving rate has been on a downward trend from about\n10 percent in the early 1980s to about minus 1 percent now. A number of forces could\npotentially be at play here, including, for example, the significant credit market\ninnovations that have taken place over that period. 6 I understand how historical averages\ncan exert a gravitational pull on the forecasts of variables like the saving rate, and I don’t\nbelieve the downward trend is likely to persist indefinitely. But having said that, it’s not\nobvious to me why we should expect that long-term trend to reverse itself beginning\nprecisely next quarter.\nAn alternative perspective on savings and consumption is that the strong recent growth in\nhousehold spending indicates optimism about future income prospects, rather than any\nfundamental recklessness. The labor market is reasonably tight, with the unemployment\nrate at 4.5 percent. Earnings are growing at about a 4 percent rate. The working age\npopulation is growing at a 0.9 percent annual rate, and payroll employment has grown\nsignificantly more rapidly, at a 1.6 percent rate for the last few years. While employment\ngrowth won’t be above average forever, prospects for real income growth look pretty\nsolid. Moreover, household net worth is up to 5¾ years of disposable personal income,\nand has been rising during this recovery, which suggests that savings, properly measured,\nmight not be so low after all. As always, real wage growth will tend to track gains in\nlabor productivity, and while productivity growth was fairly strong for the first several\nyears of this decade, the recent slowdown is a negative risk for consumer spending. On\nbalance, though, I expect consumer spending to remain reasonably healthy.\n\n3\n\n\fPutting this all together, I expect overall growth to come in below trend in the first half of\nthis year, but to return to trend by the end of the year, based on my expectation that the\nhousing market is likely to find a bottom some time this year and no longer be a drag on\ntop line growth, business investment will pick up, and consumer spending will remain\nhealthy.\nThe Phillips Curve\nAs I mentioned earlier, many commentators base their belief that inflation will moderate\non their belief that output growth will be below trend for the next few quarters. This\nconnection is based on a popular – though I will argue incomplete and potentially\nmisleading – understanding of the relationship between inflation and real economic\nactivity. This relationship is usually described by the “Phillips curve,” which typically\nshows an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment or the “output gap.” 7\nOne way of thinking about the Phillips curve is to see it as describing a set of options\nfacing policy makers – as if to say, “You can have less inflation with more\nunemployment or less unemployment with more inflation.” This characterization is very\nmuch in keeping with one of the earliest expositions of the Phillips curve as a tool for\neconomic analysis and policy. In 1960, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow estimated a\nPhillips curve for U.S. data, following A.W. Phillips’ earlier exercise for the United\nKingdom, and indicated that this curve described the set of options available to policy\nmakers “in the years immediately ahead.”\nThis traditional view of the Phillips curve sees the relationship between the real growth\nand the outlook for inflation as a structural part of the economy, that is, as invariant to\nalternative approaches to policymaking. Under this view, growth below trend causes a\ngrowing amount of “slack” in the economy, which in turn eases price pressures. And\nconversely, of course, price pressures build up when aggregate demand runs ahead of the\neconomy’s capacity for growth, making labor and commodity markets tight. This view\nsees policymakers as controlling inflation by using interest rates to engineer the\nappropriate amount of slack.\nBut this view of the Phillips curve is out of date and can be seriously misleading. As a\npurely empirical relationship, it broke down entirely during the 1970s, when inflation and\nunemployment were both simultaneously elevated. Modern monetary economics now\nunderstands the relationship between inflation and real activity as resulting from the\ndecentralized price- and wage-setting decisions of firms and workers facing frictions that\nmake very frequent price re-adjustments suboptimal. Firms set prices based on their\nexpectations regarding the marginal cost of production and the rate at which overall\nnominal demand will change over their planning horizon. Aggregating across sellers, one\nfinds that the current overall price level, and thus current inflation, depends on expected\nfuture inflation and real marginal cost. Under certain assumptions, real marginal cost\nmoves one-for-one with a measure of aggregate economic activity such as the output gap\nor the unemployment rate. 8\n\n4\n\n\fThe result is a version of the Phillips curve in which current inflation depends on\nexpected future inflation and an indicator of current economic activity, such as\nunemployment or the “output gap.” But to state it this way – with inflation depending on\na real variable – is entirely arbitrary. One could just as well write the relationship the\nother way and say that unemployment, for example, depends on inflation and expected\ninflation. In fact, inflation and real economic activity are the joint outcome of\ndecentralized decisions made by participants in the economy about demand, supply,\nprices and wages. So it is just as correct (or rather incorrect) to say below-trend growth\nwill drive inflation down, as it is to say that falling inflation will keep growth below\ntrend. Because inflation ultimately depends on the actions of the central bank, those\ndecentralized decisions will depend on past, present and expected future central bank\npolicy choices. Thus, it is central banks, not the labor market, that drive inflation down.\nThe behavior of inflation expectations is vitally important to a central bank that is\nattempting to reduce inflation. If inflation expectations are low and consistent with the\nreduction in inflation that the central bank wishes to bring about, it will be important to\nassure that they do not drift higher during the disinflation process. If inflation\nexpectations have become elevated, a sustained reduction in inflation will require\nbringing inflation expectations down as well.\nInflation expectations embody assumptions – either explicit or implicit – about how the\ncentral bank is going to conduct monetary policy in the future. One possibility is that\nexpectations are the result of past experience – that people simply extrapolate the recent\nbehavior of inflation into the future. Statistically, this approach to expectations may work\nreasonably well for people most of the time, especially if the fundamental behavior of the\ncentral bank is not changing much. People taking this approach would tend to not adjust\ntheir expectations for future inflation until they saw movements in actual inflation. In this\ncase, a successful disinflation that brings down both actual and expected inflation could\nbe protracted and costly. With inflation expectations tied down by past experience, the\nremaining mechanism for bringing down inflation is just the mechanism of the original\nPhillips curve – an increase in real interest rates that slows aggregate demand and reduces\nactual inflation.\nAlternatively, people may take a more forward-looking approach. They may believe that\ncurrent inflation has deviated temporarily from its long-run trend, and so they may\ndiscount recent observations. Moreover, they take into account that inflation will behave\ndifferently in the future if the behavior of the central bank changes. This is likely to be\nparticularly important if the central bank communicates convincingly its intention to\nbehave differently. For example, in many countries inflation expectations seemed to shift\nwhen the central bank adopted inflation targeting. Public understanding of the central\nbank’s long-run goals and of how the central bank would respond to various potential\neconomic disturbances helps anchor inflation expectations.\nInflation Expectations\n\n5\n\n\fIf inflation expectations are a key determinant of the current behavior of inflation, then\nwhat do we know about the recent behavior of inflation expectations? There are a variety\nof indicators and as you might expect, none of them is perfect. Survey measures have the\nlongest track record. The Philadelphia Fed compiles and publishes the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters every quarter. Their most recent compilation, published just last\nweek, reports a mean expectation for core PCE inflation of 2.1 percent through the end of\n2009. The average forecast for CPI inflation from the Blue Chip survey is 2.4 percent for\ncore Consumer Price Index in 2007, and 2.3 percent in 2008, which based on an assumed\ngap of four-tenths between PCE and CPI inflation translates into 2.0 percent and 1.9\npercent, respectively, a bit lower than the Philadelphia survey. Consumer surveys, in\ncontrast, yield much higher figures. Among respondents to the Reuters - University of\nMichigan survey, the median expected inflation over the next year is 3.2 percent and the\nmedian expected inflation over the next ten years is 3.1 percent. Economists typically\ndiscount data from such consumer surveys in which respondents have little or no\neconomic incentive to forecast well. Professional forecasters presumably perceive a\npecuniary benefit to having a documented record of accuracy.\nMeasures of expected inflation can be derived from the spreads between indexed and\nnon-indexed U.S. Treasury securities – the so-called TIPS spread. The improvement in\nrecent years in the depth and liquidity of the market for indexed securities provides at\nleast some confidence that such measures reflect a reasonable aggregation of market\nparticipants’ inflation expectations. The implied expectation of CPI inflation over the\nnext five years was around 1½ percent in early 2003, rose to near 2½ percent in 2004,\nand has been trading around 2.3 percent in recent weeks. Taking off four-tenths for the\naverage PCE-CPI spread, this translates to around 1.9 percent. Expectations for five-year\ninflation beginning five years from now have been running recently between 2.4 percent\nand 2.5 percent.\nAnother place to look for evidence on inflation trends is the growth in labor\ncompensation. Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector accelerated from\nunder 4 percent in 2005 to 5 percent in 2006. This is consistent with the broad\nacceleration in average hourly earnings shown in the Employment Report, and the\nupswing in the Employment Cost Index. Inflation-adjusted compensation gains should\n(and generally do) track labor productivity gains fairly closely. This is algebraically\nequivalent to saying that the markup over unit labor costs should be fairly constant. If so,\nthe growth in unit labor costs should provide a gauge of expected inflation trends, the\nidea being that workers and firms set current wages based on their near-term expectations\nfor real productivity gains and inflation. Productivity growth was relatively high early in\nthis decade, but has decelerated recently and averaged 1.6 percent last year. As a result,\nunit labor costs have accelerated and have averaged 2.4 percent over the last two years.\nThe markup has been relatively steady at an elevated level over the two years, which with\nrising unit labor costs is consistent with the rise in inflation we’ve seen.\nIf unit labor costs continue to advance at recent rates, either inflation will keep pace with\nunit labor costs, or the increase in labor costs will be absorbed by firms lowering their\nmarkups. It is true that the markup implied by the productivity and unit labor cost\n\n6\n\n\fnumbers have been high by historical standards, which accords well with the recent\nstrength in business profits, but our understanding of aggregate movements in the markup\nis limited. The markup has tended to revert to its mean, but it can deviate for long\nstretches of time. So while it is possible that the markup might fall to offset a rise in unit\nlabor costs, if we don’t know why the markup is elevated now, its hard to have much\nconfidence in a forecast that it is going to come to our rescue just in the nick of time. If\nthe markup remains relatively high, and unit labor costs continue to advance at or above 2\npercent, then we are likely to see inflation continue at about 2 percent.\nCorroborating evidence on inflation expectations is provided by recent work by James\nStock and Mark Watson. 9 They estimate a model of postwar U.S. inflation that allows\nthem to decompose inflation into a “trend” and “transitory” components, each with their\nown time-varying volatility. The time-varying volatility feature allows for changes over\ntime in the portion of the variability in inflation that is due to long-lasting swings in trend\ninflation, as we saw in the Great Inflation of the 1970s, as opposed to short-run transitory\nmovements in inflation. They find that the variability in the trend component of inflation\nhas fallen dramatically since the 1970s, consistent with other research that has\ndocumented a fall in the “persistence” of inflation since then. 10\nStock and Watson’s methodology implies that the best forecast for future inflation is the\ncurrent estimated value of the trend component, which they put at 2.1 percent (for core\nPCE inflation) as of the first quarter of 2007. This measure of trend inflation has been\nabove 2 since the fourth quarter of 2004, and peaked at 2.2 percent in the second quarter\nof 2006. Interestingly, their measure of trend was between 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent for\nover eight straight years from 1996 to 2003.\nThe Stock and Watson framework provides a natural way to assess whether any\nmoderation in core inflation is evident yet. Their measure of trend inflation fell by 6 basis\npoints from the peak (2.17 percent) in the second quarter of last year to the first quarter of\n2007 (2.11 percent). Given the shape of the probability distribution around their\nestimates, this decline does not appear to be statistically significant.\nOutlook\nA variety of expectations measures then, point to expectations for core PCE inflation of\nabout 2 percent right now. What does this imply about the outlook for actual inflation,\nwhich is now running at about 2¼ percent? The current level of inflation expectations is\nlikely to exert a gravitational pull on actual inflation, if monetary policy actions are not\ninconsistent with those expectations and no concerted effort is made to shift expectations.\nPolicy actions at variance with those expectations – for example, significant easing at a\ntime of elevated or rising inflation – would likely call those expectations into question\nand lead to a change in assessments regarding future inflation. But as long as policy\nactions appear to be plausibly consistent with movement toward 2 percent inflation and\nnothing else acts to alter inflation expectations, that’s likely to be the best forecast of\nwhere inflation is headed.\n\n7\n\n\fCould inflation fall below 2 percent, say to 1½ percent? That depends. Without a prompt\nfall in inflation expectations, a reduction in inflation below 2 percent is likely to be\ntemporary and hard to sustain. With expectations left alone, the remaining mechanism for\nbringing down inflation is the traditional Phillips curve mechanism, that is, an increase in\nreal interest rates that slows aggregate demand and reduces both inflation and real\nactivity. If expectations do not adapt to lower inflation, a sustained reduction in\nemployment and output would be required to push inflation down.\nThe prospects for bringing inflation down below 2 percent thus hinge on the extent to\nwhich a reduction in inflation expectations can be brought about. How difficult would\nthat be? Using changes in the target interest rate alone, the process is likely to be difficult\nand time-consuming. Costly reductions in real incomes and employment would be\nrequired until inflation expectations adapt. Without information suggesting a change in\nthe pattern of monetary policy conduct or clarifying the intentions of policymakers,\nmarket participants could well interpret policy moves as the continued implementation of\npast strategy.\nOne natural approach to bringing inflation expectations down more expeditiously, should\nthat be the desire, would be a strategy of clear communications about policymakers’\nintentions. Just how responsive would inflation expectations be to such communications?\nGeneral conclusions are unlikely, because the results will depend on the nature of\ncommunications, the nature of the accompanying actions, and the context in which they\nare received. There are many historical examples of significant shifts in monetary policy\nexpectations; examples include the fiscal reforms accompanying the ends of\nhyperinflations, the governance changes accompanying the adoption of explicit inflation\nobjectives in other countries, and the operational regime shift adopted by the Volcker-led\nFOMC in 1979.\nThese examples involved fairly dramatic and sizable shifts in the conduct of monetary\npolicy, however. Shifting inflation expectations from 2 percent down to 1.5 percent or 1\npercent represents a far smaller change in policy, and thus ought to be less difficult. In\nfact, exactly the opposite transition was made three years ago. As I noted earlier, core\ninflation was between 1 and 2 percent from 1996 through early 2004, and since early\n2004 core inflation has been between 2 and 2½ percent. Inflation expectations seem to\nhave shifted up accordingly; for example the TIPS spread was around 1½ percent in\n2003. The fact that core inflation so recently spent eight years between 1 and 2 percent\nsuggests that convincing the public that we were returning to such a period would not be\nthat difficult, especially in light of the fact that the Committee did not, during that earlier\nperiod, announce an intention to keep core inflation within that band.\nIn many recent instances, FOMC actions or statements appear to have induced\nsimultaneous short-run movements in market participants’ expectations regarding the\npath of the federal funds rate and inflation. For example, following the heavy hurricane\nseason of 2005, energy prices surged, policy expectations initially softened, and measures\nof inflation expectations rose. Shortly thereafter, core inflation also increased.\nExpectations were subsequently realigned after a number of speeches and statements by\n\n8\n\n\fFOMC members, but similar sequences occurred in early 2004 and the spring of 2006. A\nsimilar episode occurred in the spring of 2006 in response to another round of energy\nprice increases. Inflation expectations rose, but were subsequently tamped down by\nCommittee member communications. In both cases, the movement in inflation\nexpectations was relatively contained, but these short-run spikes suggest a pliability of\ninflation expectations in the current environment.\nThe outlook for inflation, then, is to an important extent contingent on policymakers’\nassessments of their ability to influence the evolution of inflation expectations. Such\nassessments will inevitably be inexact. Although there may be no precise historical\nanalogs for communication and actions to reduce inflation expectations in circumstances\nlike the present, my sense is that clear communications accompanied by consistent\nactions could bring about a relatively prompt and low-cost reduction in inflation.\nBut in any event, there is little disagreement about the central importance of inflation\nexpectations for the conduct of monetary policy. Inflation expectations are an outcome of\nmonetary policy, not an autonomous help or hindrance, and central banks are as\nresponsible for the behavior of inflation expectations as they are for the behavior of\ninflation.\nThank you.\n1\n\nI am grateful to John Weinberg and Roy Webb for assistance with these remarks.\nThe insurance payments associated with the September 11, 2001 attacks were treated as an offset to net\npremiums paid for insurance in the National Income and Product Accounts, resulting in a sharp decline in\nmeasured inflation for that month, and a corresponding increase in 12-month measured inflation for\nSeptember 2002, when core PCE inflation was 2.4 percent on a twelve-month basis. “Business Situation”,\nSurvey of Current Business, November, 2001, pp. 1-7.\n3\nPCE inflation for the second quarter of 2003 was originally reported as 0.7 percent.\n4\nDaniel Thornton, “The Lower and Upper Bounds of the Federal Open Market Committee’s Long-Run\nInflation Objective,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, May/June 2007, Vol. 89 No. 3.\n5\nBernanke, Ben S., “The Subprime Mortgage Market,” Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s 43rd Annual\nConference on Bank Structure and Competition, Chicago, Illinois, May 17, 2007, and Lacker, Jeffrey M.,\n“The Evolution of Consumer Finance,” Conference of State Bank Supervisors, Norfolk, Virginia, May 18,\n2006.\n6\nJohn Weinberg, “Borrowing by U.S. Households,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond 2005 Annual\nReport..\n7\nLacker, Jeffrey M., “Inflation and Unemployment,” Charlotte Economics Club, Charlotte, N.C., April 11,\n2007, and “Inflation and Unemployment: a Layperson’s Guide to the Phillips Curve,” Federal Reserve\nBank of Richmond 2006 Annual Report, forthcoming.\n8\nRobert G.

            "content": "“Inflation and Unemployment” 1\nCharlotte Economics Club\nCharlotte NC\nApril 11, 2007\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nLet me begin by telling you about some recent experiences. I had the opportunity earlier\nthis year to guest-teach a couple of business school economics classes. I opened my\ndiscussions with a pair of questions, asking students to put themselves in the place of a\nmonetary policymaker choosing a target for the federal funds rate. First I gave them a set\nof hypothetical facts about the state of the economy: a slowdown in housing in the wake\nof multi-year housing boom; rising mortgage default rates; preliminary indicators of a\nslowing in business investment. And then I asked them: “What are you going to do?”\nThe students dutifully responded that this situation could call for a reduction in the funds\nrate. They’d obviously been doing their homework.\nNext, I gave them a set of hypothetical facts about inflation: core PCE inflation, on a\nyear-over-year basis, has been above 2 percent for nearly three straight years; after some\nsigns of moderation, recent months’ inflation numbers have moved higher; energy prices\nhave been fluctuating around historically elevated levels and labor compensation is rising\nafter a relatively flat period. Same question: “What are you going to do?” Once again,\ntheir response came right out of the textbook: an increase in the funds rate is needed to\ncounter rising inflation, other things equal.\nThe trick of course is that both sets of hypothetical facts are drawn from the same period\n– basically right now. My objective was to underscore the fact that sometimes monetary\npolicy decisions are not obvious, and that figuring out the appropriate policy action\nrequires as complete a picture as possible of the state of the economy. Interpreting that\npicture and drawing policy conclusions from it can be a challenging task.\nThe situation I presented to the students represents a policymaking dilemma.\nThe actions needed to bring down inflation could work against our desire to see the real\noutlook solidify. The facts would appear to present the policymaker with a tradeoff. You\ncan address one – inflation or real growth – but that puts the other at risk. The obvious\napproach might be to decide how much “weight” one puts on each – low inflation and\nlow unemployment – and then try to conduct policy so as to minimize the weighted\naverage of the two. There is a superficial attraction to this popular view of the situation as\na simple tradeoff. But that characterization is also, I think, an extreme oversimplification and can be highly misleading. I’d like to devote my remarks today to the\nrelationship between inflation and the real side of the economy and to what I think that\nrelationship implies for policymaking. As always, the views expressed are my own, and\nnot necessarily the same as others in the Federal Reserve.\n\n\fThe relationship between inflation and the real economy can be described in terms of a\nnumber of alternative measures of real activity. Perhaps the most popular is the\nunemployment rate, because it captures the extent to which the expansion in employment\ngenerated by growth in real output is rapid enough to absorb additions to the labor force.\nAs an indicator of the economy’s use of its resources, the unemployment rate is\ncommonly used as rough measure of the extent to which real activity is giving rise to\n“inflation pressures,” but I will have much more to say about this later on.\nUnemployment and inflation have, together, been at the center of macroeconomics for at\nleast as long as there has been a field called macroeconomics. The relationship between\nthese two variables is usually summarized by what’s called the Phillips curve, named for\nA. W. Phillips, the economist who in 1957 documented an inverse relationship between\nunemployment and wage inflation in nearly 100 years of data for the United Kingdom. 2\nBut the notion that rising inflation might at times be associated with rising real growth\nand falling unemployment had been recognized and discussed by early economists, a fact\nthat has been emphasized by many scholars, including Robert Lucas in his Nobel lecture\nand by my long-time Richmond Fed colleague, Thomas Humphrey, who retired in 2005. 3\nSince Phillips’ original paper, his curve has played a critical role in the evolution of\nthinking about macroeconomics and monetary policy. It captures the notable correlations\nbetween inflation and unemployment, although those correlations vary over time in\nimportant ways. But more importantly, it embodies compactly a theoretical understanding\nof the interplay between inflation and real economic forces. Because of its importance,\nand because the modern version of the Phillips curve is in some respects starkly different\nfrom the early edition, I think it will be worthwhile to briefly review some of the Phillips\ncurve’s history, before examining the role it plays today in thinking about monetary\npolicy.\n\nA.W. Phillips’ curve\nThe Phillips curve began as an atheoretical relationship drawn to fit the data. The form\nwith which people are most familiar – linking unemployment to price inflation – was first\nset down in 1960 by Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow for U.S. data. 4 Following\nSamuelson and Solow, the Phillips curve was interpreted as describing a set of choices\navailable to society each time period. According to this view, if the data suggested that\nprice stability tended to coexist, on average, with 5 percent unemployment, we would\nhave to live with higher inflation to enjoy unemployment persistently lower than 5\npercent. This thinking led to descriptions of policy as either stimulating real activity at\nthe cost of rising inflation, or fighting inflation by restraining the real economy. This\nunderstanding of the Phillips curve seems to have contributed to a political sentiment\nthat, at least when inflation was relatively low, the costs of a little more inflation were\nworth the return in reduced unemployment.\nBut an alternative understanding of the Phillips curve was emerging in the 1960s. Milton\nFriedman and Edmund Phelps, separately, focused on the role of expectations in the\n\n2\n\n\frelationship between inflation and unemployment. 5 Specifically, they argued that while\ninflationary policy actions that were not anticipated by the public could have a temporary\nstimulative effect on the economy, fully anticipated inflation would not affect real\nactivity. Similarly, surprise disinflation could have a temporary contractionary effect but\nfully anticipated disinflation would not. This meant that the observed correlation in the\ndata between inflation and unemployment must have come largely from episodes in\nwhich changes in the inflation rate were not expected by the public.\nAccording to the expectation-augmented Phillips curve developed by Friedman and\nPhelps, changes in inflation, and by implication monetary policy, could not have\npersistent, lasting effects on real economic activity. Over the medium to long run,\neconomic growth and unemployment would tend to return to rates that were determined\nby productivity growth, population dynamics, and other characteristics of the markets for\ngoods and labor.\nTo illustrate, suppose a policymaker consults a Phillips curve estimated from historical\ndata that tells him that 3 percent unemployment can be achieved at 5 percent inflation. If\nthe policymaker then eased interest rates in order to bring unemployment down, the\npolicy might initially have the intended effect, provided the public continues to expect the\nlower previously prevailing inflation rate. But, the Friedman-Phelps framework argues, a\nsustained effort to reduce unemployment by maintaining inflation at 5 percent would\nultimately lead the public to adjust their expectations for inflation. In the long run,\nunemployment would rise again to its “natural” level consistent with the real structure of\nthe economy. Monetary policy can only have a transitory effect on unemployment.\nIn retrospect, many observers have labeled the Friedman-Phelps analysis prescient. They\npoint to the 1970s as a confirmation of the implications of the expectations-augmented\nPhillips curve, because the period of high and volatile inflation in the 1970s brought no\nsustained improvement in real economic activity. In fact, not coincidentally, the general\nperformance of the real economy during that period was poor.\nThe analysis of Friedman and Phelps focused attention on the critical macroeconomic\nrole of expectations. They assumed adaptive expectations, meaning that households and\nfirms based their expectations of future inflation on their observations of recent past\ninflation. (For example, models of that era frequently represented inflation expectations\nas a simple weighted average of past inflation.) In this view, an increase in the inflation\nrate may catch people by surprise, but over time they would learn about the altered policy\nstance. But why wouldn’t people try to look ahead and foresee what the central bank was\nlikely to do, rather than rely on the mechanical adaptive-expectations forecasting\nformula? For example, why wouldn’t they expect the central bank to try to exploit a\nshort-run Phillips curve, even before inflation rises? Such anticipation could rob\ninflationary policy of even its short-run stimulative effects.\nIn 1972, Robert Lucas provided an alternative, rational expectations analysis of the\nrelationship between inflation and real activity. Under rational expectations,\n\n3\n\n\fpeople’s expectations are based not just on their past observations, but also on their\nassessment of how the economy is likely to behave, including their knowledge of the\nprocess driving policymakers’ choices. The rational expectations analysis retained the\nFriedman-Phelps implication that only unexpected inflation would be associated with\nfalling unemployment. But rational expectations implies that the public’s reaction to\npolicy is more forward looking than in the case of adaptive expectations.\nIn separate work, Lucas also showed how rational expectations presented a challenge to\nmaking policy choices based on statistical estimates of such relationships as the Phillips\ncurve. 6 In what has famously become known as the Lucas Critique, he showed that shifts\nin the pattern of policy behavior would cause such relationships like the Phillips curve to\nshift as well, so that statistical estimates from historical data would no longer be relevant\nfor predicting the economy’s response to changing policy.\nLater in the 1970s, Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott built on Lucas’ work and analyzed\nthe problem faced by a policymaker when the public is forward-looking. 7 They studied\nthe temptations faced by a central bank choosing policy period-by-period. In any given\nperiod, what the public expected the central bank to do has already been determined.\nGiven those beliefs, the policymaker can pull down unemployment with a little more\nunanticipated inflation. But people understand that the policymaker will be tempted to\ninduce unanticipated inflation, and thus they don’t believe prices will be stable – the\ninflation will be anticipated. The result is higher inflation with no gain in real activity.\nWhat the policymaker would like to do is find a way to commit to price stability, that is,\ncommit to not give in to the temptation to attempt to reduce unemployment by inducing\nunanticipated inflation. The work of Kydland and Prescott highlighted to role of a central\nbank’s credibility, in other words, the extent to which the public believes their\ncommitment to price stability. Their work highlights the extent to which establishing\ncredibility requires, indeed is virtually identical to, sacrificing future flexibility.\nThe linchpin of the link between inflation, unemployment and monetary policy is thus the\npublic’s expectations for inflation. If a run-up in inflation has been correctly anticipated,\nthen it up will have little or no effect on unemployment. Similarly, if people expect\nfalling inflation, then unemployment will not increase as much as it would if the\ndisinflation were unanticipated. Thomas Sargent demonstrated this dramatically in his\nanalysis of the ends of hyperinflations in a number of countries. 8 Very large reductions in\ninflation were achieved at much less cost than would be predicted by a standard Phillips\ncurve, when those reductions were part of a comprehensive package of monetary and\nfiscal reforms.\nThe role of expectations figured prominently in the disinflation that took place in the\nearly 1980s under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. The Fed had delayed taking strong\nenough action against inflation before Volcker took office in 1979, in part out of a belief\nthat the slope of the Phillips curve was such that a fairly large increase in unemployment\nwould be required to reduce inflation. The cost of the Volcker disinflation turned out to\nbe substantially less than predicted however. The recent release of the FOMC transcripts\n\n4\n\n\ffrom that era reveals that the public’s inflation expectations were quite prominent in the\nCommittee’s discussions. 9\n\nThe Modern Phillips Curve\nPrior to the 1970s and 1980s, a significant methodological divide separated\nmacroeconomics and microeconomics. That divide broke down when economists\nlearned how to study models of the aggregate economy that were built on sound\nmicroeconomic foundations – general equilibrium models, in other words – but were also\ncapable of addressing macroeconomic issues. The latter required models that were\ndynamic, because investment and interest are central to macroeconomics, and stochastic\nas well, because business cycle fluctuations seem to be to some extent unanticipated. 10\nThe first generation of such models had no substantive interaction between inflation and\nreal economic activity, and they displayed business cycles that were driven entirely by\nreal phenomenon. The challenge was to build models that captured the inflationunemployment link in a compelling way.\nThe modern Phillips curve emerged out of one approach to understanding the links\nbetween inflation and real economic activity in such well-grounded models. The\napproach involves specifying price-setting frictions that make a firm’s choice of the price\nof its goods a dynamic decision that depends on expectations of future inflation. In\naddition, a monopolistic competition feature provides firms with the scope for\nmeaningful price setting decisions. Under common forms of this friction, only a fraction\nof sellers reset their prices each period. Anticipating a length of time before the next\nopportunity to adjust their price, sellers will choose a price depending on what they think\nwill happen to the overall level of prices during that interval. Aggregating across sellers,\none finds that current prices (and thus current inflation) depend on expected future\ninflation. 11 This comports with common sense intuition – money has value only because\nit is expected to have value in the future. So the value of money today depends on value it\nis expected to have in the future.\nIn this class of models, current inflation also depends on real economic variables,\nparticularly the real marginal cost of production, since relative prices are set as markups\nover marginal costs. Under certain heroic assumptions, a one-for-one relationship\nemerges between the real marginal cost of production and a measure of the scale of\naggregate economic activity, like output or the unemployment rate. That case results in\nan equation one could describe as a Phillips curve, relating current inflation to current\nreal activity and expected future inflation. 12\nAlthough this approach has broad acceptance, in fairness I should note that it is not\nwithout its critics. Some economists view the price-setting frictions that are at the core of\nthis approach as ad hoc and unpersuasive. Moreover, there are alternative frictions, such\nas spatial separation and limited information, that can also rationalize monetary nonneutrality. Nonetheless, a Phillips curve derived from price-setting frictions has become\nthe leading model for applied central bank policy analysis.\n\n5\n\n\fThis modern form of the Phillips curve closely resembles the expectations-augmented\nPhillips curve I discussed earlier, and thus shares many of the same properties. For\nexample, a marked movement in inflation will be associated with a move in\nunemployment only if the inflation is different from what the public expected.\nFurthermore, inflation expectations in these models are forward-looking, so expected\ninflation, just like inflation itself and unemployment, is an endogenous variable\ndetermined by the interaction of the conduct of monetary policy with private sector\ndecisions and shocks to the economy.\nWhen economists take this new Phillips curve to the data, they often find that past\ninflation helps explain inflation dynamics, even after attempting to control for expected\ninflation. This finding has led some to formulate versions of the Phillips curve in which\nboth forward-looking and backward-looking price-setting behavior play a role. 13\nBackward-looking price-setters are assumed to form expectations as a weighted average\nof past inflation, consistent with the old adaptive expectations assumption in Friedman\nand Phelps, or else set prices using a simple rule of thumb based on recent inflation\nwhich amounts to the same thing.\nThis so-called “hybrid” Phillips curve implies an intrinsic persistence to inflation, beyond\nthat implied by the persistence of external shocks, the effect of expected inflation on\ncurrent inflation, or the conduct of policy. Moreover, in the presence of significant\nbackward-looking price-setting behavior, inflation would be prone to respond more\nslowly to changes in policy. Consequently, a backward-looking component implies that\nthe real economic costs of bringing down inflation may be higher than would the case\nwith a purely forward-looking Phillips curve. For the same reasons, backward-looking\nfeatures would mean that inflation does not respond as rapidly to a change in policy as it\notherwise might, even if that change itself is well explained by the policymaker and well\nanticipated and understood by the public.\nIn these so-called “hybrid’ Phillips curves, the extent to which price-setting and\nexpectations are backward looking can matter a great deal for monetary policy. As a\nresult, a small cottage industry of economists is now devoted to estimating hybrid Phillips\ncurves to try to find the appropriate weight to put on backward-looking price-setting.\nCommon estimates are that around 25 percent of agents form expectations in a backwardlooking fashion, although estimates of up to 60 percent have been obtained. Many such\nestimates assume that the conduct of monetary policy has been constant over this period,\nin the sense that it was guided by a single consistent pattern of behavior. If instead one\nallows for the possibility of shifts in monetary policy, then the estimated weight on a\nbackward-looking component in the Phillips curve is far lower – in fact, often zero. The\nintuition is straightforward. By not allowing persistent swings in monetary policy, the\nstandard approach can mistakenly attribute inflation persistence to backward-looking\nexpectations. The observed persistence of inflation thus might arise from forward-looking\nbehavior combined with uncertainty in the public’s mind about policy trends. If people\nare uncertain about the policymaker’s objectives or strategy, then their inflation\n\n6\n\n\fexpectations will adjust more slowly as they learn about these features of policy by\nobserving actual policy outcomes.\n\nPolicy\nWhile there is reasonably strong statistical evidence of shifts in monetary policy,\nthe premise that inflation expectations are forward-looking and that the conduct of\nmonetary policy has evolved over time is also broadly consistent with the postwar history\nof U.S. monetary policy. Moreover, that history is intimately intertwined with the\nevolution of our understanding of the relationships embodied in the Phillips curve. 14\nWidely held views about the Phillips curve in the 1960s suggested that tolerating a small\namount of inflation would allow permanently lower unemployment. As trend inflation\nsteadily rose into the early 1970s, the public came to expect higher inflation to persist and\nthe Phillips curve shifted out. Policymakers had overlooked the endogeneity of inflation\nexpectations, and their influence on future inflation outcomes. In the 1970s, policymakers\nwere reluctant to attack inflation aggressively out of a belief, based on the estimated\nslope of the Phillips curve, that high sustained unemployment would be required to\nreduce inflation. Belief in backward-looking expectations led policymakers to\nunderestimate the extent to which they could influence the evolution of expectations and\nthereby reduce the cost of disinflation. Unemployment did increase during the\ndisinflation that Chairman Volcker initiated in 1979, but by substantially less than had\nbeen predicted by backward-looking Phillips curves. On several occasions after that,\nidentified as “inflation scares” by my former colleague Marvin Goodfriend, inflation\nexpectations rose and the Fed responded aggressively by raising real interest rates above\nwhat otherwise would have been warranted. 15 These episodes helped gain credibility for\nthe Fed’s commitment to low inflation. Realized inflation fell in the 1990s. Between\nNovember 1995 and March 2004 (except for a six-month period around September 11,\n2001), 12-month core PCE inflation was between 1 and 2 percent. The stabilization of\ninflation expectations at low levels was crucial to that success.\nI have given you an overview of the evolution of economists’ understanding of the\nPhillips Curve, that is, the links between inflation and unemployment. To briefly\nsummarize, the Phillips curve began life as an atheoretical relationship, drawn to fit\nhistorical correlations. It then became a static menu of inflation-unemployment options\navailable to policymakers. But that approach neglected the dynamic, forward-looking\nnature of the decisions underlying the observed statistical relationship. The static Phillips\ncurve broke down in the late 1960s and 1970s, just when policymakers began to rely on\nit, and in fact partly because they began to rely on it. The Phillips curve relationship was\nrebuilt from first principles in 1980s and 1990s. In the resulting modern Phillips curve the\nforward-looking expectations of price-setters plays a dominant role.\nThe modern Phillips curve has several important implications. First, the conduct of\nmonetary policy is best understood as a pattern of behavior, or a “rule” in the broad sense\nof the word, not necessarily an algebraic formula. This contrasts with the view of\nmonetary policy as a sequence of one-shot choices of policy rate that was inherent in the\n\n7\n\n\fearly version of the Phillips curve and the way my students were thinking about it. The\nreason it makes sense to think of policy this way is that expectations about future policy\nplay a key role in the decisions people make today.\nAn immediate corollary is the importance of credibility, because low and stable inflation\ntoday requires that people believe inflation will be low and stable in the immediate\nfuture. And it deserves emphasis that credibility means giving up some flexibility in the\nfuture. Another immediate corollary is the value of central bank communications,\nespecially communications aimed at helping people understand likely future outcomes for\ninflation. The value of communications is what has led several central banks to announce\nexplicit numerical objectives for inflation.\nThe central theme, however, is that just as central banks are now widely acknowledged to\nbe responsible for the behavior of inflation, they are just as responsible for the behavior\nof inflation expectations, because expectations are central to inflation dynamics. Related,\ncentral banks should not take expectations for granted by acting in ways that are\ninconsistent with those expectations, without taking into account that those expectations\nmay change as a result. For example, economists have detected a decline in inflation\npersistence – that is, an increase in the tendency for inflation to return to trend after a\ndeviation from trend. One might be tempted to count on inflation to return to trend more\nrapidly now, and infer that less policy response is needed when inflation departs from\ntrend. But the fall in persistence surely reflects the fact that policy reacts more forcefully\nthan before. Thus, a more rapid reversion to trend may be predicated on an implicit belief\nthat the Fed will act to bring that about. Failing to do so risks a shift in expectations that\nmakes inflation less likely to revert to trend.\nThe modern Phillips curve is particularly relevant to the dilemma I posed for my business\nschool students, that is, for evaluating alternative policy strategies for restoring price\nstability. Would reducing inflation require large increases in unemployment? Again, the\nkey is the behavior of inflation expectations, which now seem to hover between 2 and 21/2 percent, a bit below inflation itself, and somewhat higher than rates consistent with\nprice stability. One might be pessimistic about the Fed’s ability to reduce inflation below\n2 percent without significant increases in employment if one takes the current level of\ninflation expectations as given. On the other hand, a strategy of clear and forceful\ncommunications about policy intentions, if successful, could bring inflation and inflation\nexpectations down at significantly less cost. In this case, a more rapid return to price\nstability could be achieved, and would require less unemployment and less policy\ntightening than would otherwise be the case.\nHow responsive are inflation expectations to policymaker influence? General\nprescriptions should not be expected, since results will depend on the nature of central\nbank communication, the actions that accompany them and the context in which they are\nreceived. There are many examples of significant shifts in expectations induced by\nconvincing people of a break from past practice. Examples include the fiscal reforms\naccompanying the ends of hyperinflations I mentioned earlier, the operational regime\nshift adopted by the Volcker FOMC in 1979, and the adoption of explicit inflation\n\n8\n\n\fobjectives by several foreign central banks. In many recent instances, FOMC actions or\nstatements have induced short-run movements in market participants’ expectations\nregarding the path of the federal funds rate and inflation. Fall 2005 and spring 2006 stand\nout as noteworthy examples. Although there may be no precise historical analogs for\npotential communications and actions to restore price stability in circumstances like the\npresent day, these examples suggest, to me at least, that policymakers can have a\nsignificant effect on inflation expectations.\nIn any case, the centrality of inflation expectations in the modern Phillips curve\nreinforces the importance of consistency and credibility in monetary policymaking,\nsince these are traits that reduce people’s uncertainty about future policy and stabilize\nexpected inflation. Central banks should not underestimate the degree to which they are\ncapable of influencing the evolution of inflation expectations. To paraphrase the late\nMilton Friedman, inflation is always and everywhere an expectational phenomenon. To\nput it another way, inflation expectations are an outcome of monetary policy, not an\nautonomous help or hindrance. Central banks are as responsible for the behavior of\ninflation expectations as they are for the behavior of inflation. That recognition is the key\nto sound monetary policy.\nAgain, thank you for inviting me to speak here today.\n1\n\nJohn Weinberg contributed to these remarks.\nPhillips (1957).\n3\nLucas (1996), Humphrey(1991).\n4\nSamuelson and Solow (1960).\n5\nFriedman (1969), Phelps (1969).\n6\nLucas (1976).\n7\nKydland and Prescott (1977).\n8\nSargent (1986)\n9\nGoodfriend and King (2005).\n10\nKydland and Prescott (1982).\n11\nKing (2000)\n12\nSome in the literature refer to this as the “New Keynesian Phillips Curve,” and to the underlying model\nas the “New Neoclassical Economics.”\n13\nGali and Gertler (1999).\n14\nThomas Sargent and others have argued that it was changes in understanding of the Phillips curve that\ndrove swings in Fed policy over this period.

            "content": "“Inflation and Unemployment”\nVirginia Association of Economists\nRichmond, Virginia\nMarch 29, 2007\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nI recently had the opportunity to guest-teach a couple of business school economics\nclasses. It was great to be back in the classroom. Don’t get me wrong – I like my current\njob. But it was nice not to have to vote on anything.\nI opened my discussions with a pair of questions, asking students to put themselves in the\nplace of a monetary policymaker choosing a target for the federal funds rate. First I gave\nthem a set of hypothetical facts about the state of the economy – a slowdown in housing\nin the wake of multi-year housing boom; rising mortgage default rates; preliminary\nindicators of a possible slowing in business investment. And then I asked them: “What\nare you going to do?” The students dutifully responded that this situation could call for a\nreduction in the funds rate. They’d obviously been doing their homework.\nNext, I gave them a set of hypothetical facts about inflation – core PCE inflation, on a\nyear-over-year basis, has been above 2 percent for nearly three straight years; after some\nsigns of moderation, recent months’ inflation numbers have moved higher; energy prices\nhave been fluctuating around historically elevated levels and futures markets predict\nfurther increases to come; and labor compensation is rising after a relatively flat period.\nSame question: “What are you going to do?” Once again, their response came right out of\nthe textbook – an increase in the funds rate is needed to counter rising inflation, other\nthings equal.\nThe trick of course is that both sets of hypothetical facts are drawn from the same period\n– basically right now. My objective was to underscore the fact that sometimes monetary\npolicy decisions are not obvious, and that figuring out the appropriate policy action\nrequires as complete a picture as possible of the state of the economy. Interpreting that\npicture can be a challenging task.\nThe situation I presented to the students represents a policy-making dilemma. The actions\nneeded to bring down inflation could work against our desire to see the real outlook\nsolidify. The facts appear to present the policymaker with a tradeoff. You can address one\n– inflation or real growth – but that puts the other at risk.\nThere is an element of truth to characterizing this situation as a tradeoff. But that\ncharacterization is also, I think, an extreme over-simplification and can be highly\nmisleading. Monetary policy actions today are capable of affecting inflation and\n\n\funemployment both now and in the future. Consequently, it is a mistake to view policy\ndecision-making as a sequence of one-shot trade-offs. Some understanding of how\ninflation and unemployment interrelate over time is essential. I’d like to devote my\nremarks tonight to the relationship between inflation and the real side of the economy and\nto what I think that relationship implies for policy-making.\nThe relationship between inflation and the real economy can be described in terms of a\nnumber of alternative measures of real activity. Perhaps the most popular is the\nunemployment rate, because it captures the extent to which the expansion in employment\ngenerated by growth in real output is rapid enough to absorb additions to the labor force.\nAs an indicator of the economy’s use of its resources, the unemployment rate is\ncommonly used as rough measure of the extent to which real activity is giving rise to\n“inflation pressures,” but I will have much more to say about this later on.\nUnemployment and inflation have, together, been at the center of macroeconomics for at\nleast as long as there has been a field called macroeconomics. The relationship between\nthese two variables is usually summarized by the Phillips curve, named for A. W.\nPhillips, the economist who in 1957 documented an inverse relationship between\nunemployment and wage inflation in nearly 100 years of data for the United Kingdom. 1\nBut the notion that rising inflation might at times be associated with rising real growth\nand falling unemployment had been recognized and discussed by early economists, a fact\nthat has been emphasized by many scholars, including Robert Lucas in his Nobel lecture\nand by my long-time Richmond Fed colleague, Thomas Humphrey, who retired in 2005. 2\nSince Phillips’ original paper, his curve has played a critical role in the evolution of\nthinking about macroeconomics and monetary policy. It captures the notable correlations\nbetween inflation and unemployment, although those correlations vary over time in\nimportant ways. But more importantly, it embodies compactly a theoretical understanding\nof the interplay between inflation and real economic forces. Because of its importance,\nand because the modern version of the Phillips curve is in some respects starkly different\nfrom the early edition, I think it will be worth our time to briefly review some of the\nPhillips curve’s history, before examining the role it plays today in thinking about\nmonetary policy. As always, the views expressed are my own, and not necessarily the\nsame as others in the Federal Reserve.\n\nA.W. Phillips’ curve\nThe Phillips curve began as an atheoretical relationship drawn to fit the data. The form\nwith which people are most familiar – linking unemployment to price inflation – was first\nset down in 1960 by Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow for U.S. data. Following\nSamuelson and Solow, the Phillips curve was interpreted as describing a set of choices\navailable to society each time period. According to this view, if the data suggested that\nprice stability tended to coexist, on average, with 5 percent unemployment, we would\nhave to live with higher inflation to enjoy persistently lower unemployment. This\nthinking led to descriptions of policy as either stimulating real activity at the cost of\n\n2\n\n\frising inflation, or fighting inflation by restraining the real economy. This understanding\nof the Phillips curve seems to have contributed to a political sentiment that, at least when\ninflation was relatively low, the costs of a little more inflation were worth the return in\nreduced unemployment.\nBut an alternative understanding of the Phillips curve was emerging in the 1960s. Milton\nFriedman and Edmund Phelps, separately, focused on the role of expectations in the\nrelationship between inflation and unemployment. 3 Specifically, they argued that while\ninflationary policy actions that were not anticipated by the public could have a temporary\nstimulative effect on the economy, fully anticipated inflation would not affect real\nactivity. Similarly, surprise disinflation could have a temporary contractionary effect but\nfully anticipated disinflation would not. This meant that the observed correlation in the\ndata between inflation and unemployment must have come largely from episodes in\nwhich changes in the inflation rate were not expected by the public.\nAccording to the expectation-augmented Phillips curve developed by Friedman and\nPhelps, changes in inflation, and by implication monetary policy, could not have\npersistent, lasting effects on real economic activity. Over the long run, economic growth\nand unemployment would tend to return to rates that were determined by productivity\ngrowth, population dynamics, and other characteristics of the markets for goods and\nlabor.\nTo illustrate, suppose a policymaker consults a Phillips curve estimated from historical\ndata that tells him that 3 percent unemployment can be achieved at 5 percent inflation. If\nthe policymaker then eased interest rates in order to bring unemployment down, the\npolicy might initially have the intended effect, provided the public continues to expect the\nlower previously prevailing inflation rate. But, the Friedman-Phelps framework argues, a\nsustained effort to maintain inflation at 5 percent would ultimately lead the public to\nadjust their expectations for inflation. In the long run, unemployment would rise again to\nits “natural” level given by the real structure of the economy.\nIn retrospect, many observers have labeled the Friedman-Phelps analysis prescient. They\npoint to the 1970s as a confirmation of the implications of the expectations-augmented\nPhillips curve, because the period of high and volatile inflation in the 1970s brought no\nsustained improvement in real economic activity. In fact, not coincidentally, the general\nperformance of the real economy during that period was poor.\nThe analysis of Friedman and Phelps focused attention on the critical macroeconomic\nrole of expectations. They assumed adaptive expectations, meaning that households and\nfirms based their expectations of future inflation on their observations of recent past\ninflation. This made it very natural to think of an increase in the rate of inflation as\nnecessarily catching people by surprise; only over time would they learn about the altered\npolicy stance. But why wouldn’t people try to foresee how the central bank would behave\nrather than rely on the mechanical adaptive-expectations forecasting formula? For\nexample, why wouldn’t they expect the central bank to try to exploit a short-run Phillips\ncurve, even before inflation rises? Such anticipation could rob inflationary policy of even\n\n3\n\n\fits short-run stimulative effects. In 1972, Robert Lucas provided an alternative, rational\nexpectations analysis of the relationship between inflation and real activity. Under\nrational expectations, people’s expectations are based not just on their past observations,\nbut also on their knowledge of how the economy is likely to behave, including their\nknowledge of the process driving policymakers’ choices.\nThe rational expectations analysis retained the Friedman-Phelps implication that only\nunexpected inflation would be associated with falling unemployment. But under rational\nexpectations, the policymaker lacked the ability to systematically exploit even a short-run\ntradeoff between inflation and unemployment.\nIn separate work, Lucas also showed how rational expectations presented a challenge to\nmaking policy choices based on statistical estimates of such relationships as the Phillips\ncurve. In what has famously become known as the Lucas Critique, he showed that shifts\nin the pattern of policy behavior would cause such relationships like the Phillips curve to\nshift as well, so that statistical estimates from historical data would no longer be relevant\nfor predicting the economy’s response to changing policy.\nRational expectations imply that the public’s reaction to policy is more forward-looking\nthan in the case of adaptive expectations. Also in the 1970s, Finn Kydland and Edward\nPrescott analyzed the problem faced by a policymaker when the public is forwardlooking. 4 They dissect the temptation faced by a policymaker choosing inflation periodby-period. They study a setting that features a natural rate of unemployment and in which\nthe best possible policy is one that achieves price stability. In any given period, what the\npublic expected the central bank to do has already been determined. Given those beliefs,\nthe policymaker can pull down unemployment with a little more inflation. But people\nunderstand that the policymaker will be so tempted, and thus they don’t believe prices\nwill be stable. The result is higher inflation with no gain in real activity. What the\npolicymaker would like to do is find a way to commit to price stability. The work of\nKydland and Prescott highlighted to role of a central bank’s credibility; that is, the extent\nto which the public believes their commitment to price stability. Their work highlights\nthe extent to which establishing credibility requires, indeed is virtually identical to,\nsacrificing future flexibility.\nSo the linchpin of the link between inflation, unemployment and monetary policy is the\npublic’s expectations for inflation. If a run-up in inflation has been correctly anticipated,\nthen it up will have little or no effect on unemployment. Similarly, if people expect\nfalling inflation, then unemployment will not increase as much as it would if the\ndisinflation were unanticipated. Thomas Sargent demonstrated this dramatically in his\nanalysis of the ends of hyperinflations in a number of countries. 5 When part of a\ncomprehensive monetary and fiscal reform, very large reductions in inflation were\nachieved at much less cost than would be predicted by a standard Phillips curve.\nThe role of expectations figured prominently in the disinflation that took place in the\nearly 1980s under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. The Fed had delayed taking strong\nenough action against inflation before Volcker took office in 1979, in part out of a belief\n\n4\n\n\fthat the slope of the Phillips curve was such that a fairly large increase in unemployment\nwould be required to reduce inflation. The cost of the Volcker disinflation turned out to\nbe substantially less than predicted however. The recent release of the FOMC transcripts\nfrom that era reveals that the public’s inflation expectations were prominent in the\nCommittee’s discussions. 6\n\nThe Modern Phillips Curve\nPrior to the 1970s and 1980s, a significant methodological divide separated\nmacroeconomics and microeconomics. That divide broke down when economists learned\nhow to study models of the aggregate economy that were built on sound microeconomic\nfoundations – general equilibrium models, in other words – but were also capable of\naddressing macroeconomic issues. The latter required models that were dynamic, because\ninvestment and interest are central to macroeconomics, and stochastic as well, because\nbusiness cycle fluctuations seem to be to some extent unanticipated. 7 The first generation\nof such models had no substantive interaction between inflation and real economic\nactivity, and they displayed business cycles that were driven entirely by real\nphenomenon. The challenge was to build models that captured the inflationunemployment link in a compelling way.\nThe modern Phillips curve emerged out of one approach to understanding monetary nonneutrality in (otherwise) general equilibrium settings. The approach involves specifying\nprice-setting frictions that make a firm’s choice of the price of its goods a dynamic\ndecision that depends on expectations of future inflation. In addition, a monopolistic\ncompetition feature provides firms with the scope for meaningful price setting decisions.\nUnder common forms of this friction, only a fraction of sellers reset their prices each\nperiod. Anticipating a length of time before the next opportunity to adjust their price,\nsellers will choose a price depending on what they think will happen to the overall level\nof prices during that interval. Aggregating across sellers, one finds that current prices\n(and thus current inflation) depend on expected future inflation. 8\nIn this class of models, current inflation also depends on real economic variables,\nparticularly the real marginal cost of production, since prices are set as markups over\nmarginal costs. Under certain heroic assumptions, a one-for-one relationship emerges\nbetween the real marginal cost of production and a measure of the scale of aggregate\neconomic activity, like output or the unemployment rate. That case results in an equation\none could describe as a Phillips curve, relating current inflation to current real activity\nand expected future inflation. 9\nAlthough this approach has broad acceptance, I should note that it is not without its\ncritics. Many economists view the price-setting frictions that are at the core of this\napproach as ad hoc and unpersuasive. Moreover, there are alternative frictions, such as\nspatial separation and limited information, that can also rationalize monetary nonneutrality. Nonetheless, a Phillips curve derived from price-setting frictions has become\nthe workhorse for applied central bank policy analysis.\n\n5\n\n\fThis modern form of the Phillips curve closely resembles the expectations-augmented\nPhillips curve of Friedman and Phelps, and thus shares many of the same properties. For\nexample, a marked movement in inflation will be associated with a move in\nunemployment only if the inflation is different from what the public expects to prevail in\nthe near future. Furthermore, inflation expectations in these models are forward-looking,\nso expected inflation, just like inflation itself and unemployment, is an endogenous\nvariable determined by the interaction of the conduct of monetary policy with private\nsector decisions and shocks to the economy.\nWhen economists take this new Phillips curve to the data, they often find that past\ninflation helps explain inflation dynamics, even after attempting to control for expected\ninflation. This finding has led some to formulate versions of the Phillips curve in which\nboth forward-looking and backward-looking price-setting behavior play a role. 10\nBackward-looking price-setters are assumed to form expectations as a weighted average\nof past inflation, consistent with the adaptive expectations assumption in Friedman and\nPhelps, or else set prices using a simple rule of thumb based on recent inflation.\nThis so-called “hybrid” Phillips curve implies an intrinsic persistence to inflation, beyond\nthat implied by the persistence of external shocks, the effect of expected inflation on\ncurrent inflation, or the conduct of policy. Moreover, in the presence of significant\nbackward-looking price-setting behavior, inflation would be prone to respond more\nslowly to changes in policy. Consequently, a backward-looking component implies that\nthe real economic costs of bringing down inflation may be higher than would the case\nwith a purely forward-looking Phillips curve. For the same reasons, backward-looking\nfeatures would mean that inflation does not respond as rapidly to a change in policy as it\notherwise might, even if that change itself is well explained by the policymaker and well\nanticipated and understood by the public.\nA small cottage industry of economists is now devoted to estimating hybrid Phillips\ncurves to try to find the appropriate weight to put on backward-looking price-setting.\nCommon estimates are that around 25 percent of agents form expectations in a backwardlooking fashion, although estimates of up to 60 percent have been obtained. Many such\nestimates assume that the conduct of monetary policy has been constant over this period,\nin the sense that it was guided by a single pattern of behavior. If instead one allows for\nshifts in monetary policy, then the estimated weight on a backward-looking component in\nthe Phillips curve is far lower – in fact, often zero. By not allowing persistent swings in\nmonetary policy, the standard approach can mistakenly attribute inflation persistence to\nbackward-looking expectations. The observed persistence of inflation thus might arise\nfrom forward-looking behavior combined with uncertainty in the public’s mind about\npolicy trends. If people are uncertain about the policymaker’s objectives or strategy, then\ntheir expectations will adjust more slowly as they learn about these features of policy by\nobserving actual policy outcomes.\n\n6\n\n\fPolicy\nWhile there is reasonably strong statistical evidence of shifts in monetary policy, the\npremise that inflation expectations are forward-looking and that the conduct of monetary\npolicy has evolved over time is also broadly consistent with the postwar history of U.S.\nmonetary policy. Moreover, that history is intimately intertwined with the evolution of\nscientific understanding of the relationships embodied in the Phillips curve. 11 Widely\nheld views about the Phillips curve in the 1960s suggested that tolerating a small amount\nof inflation would allow permanently lower unemployment. As trend inflation steadily\nrose into the early 1970s, the public came to expect higher inflation to persist and the\nPhillips curve shifted out. Policymakers had overlooked the endogeneity of inflation\nexpectations, and their influence on future inflation outcomes. In the 1970s, policymakers\nwere reluctant to attack inflation aggressively out of a belief, based on the estimated\nslope of the Phillips curve, that high sustained unemployment would be required to\nreduce inflation. Belief in backward-looking expectations led policymakers to\nunderestimate the extent to which they could influence the evolution of expectations and\nthereby reduce the cost of disinflation. Unemployment did increase during the\ndisinflation that Chairman Volcker initiated in 1979, but by substantially less than had\nbeen predicted by backward-looking Phillips curves. On several occasions after that,\nidentified as “inflation scares” by my former colleague Marvin Goodfriend, inflation\nexpectations rose and the Fed responded aggressively by raising real interest rates above\nwhat otherwise would have been warranted. 12 These episodes helped gain credibility for\nthe Fed’s commitment to low inflation.\nAs realized inflation fell in the 1990s, available measures of expected inflation fell as\nwell, and since then they have been fairly low and stable. But this apparent stability,\nrelative to the wide swings they displayed in prior decades, should not be cause for\ncomplacency, particularly with inflation currently running uncomfortably high. Some\nobservers, for example, have noted that the decline in the persistence of inflation in recent\ndecades makes it more likely that inflation will soon decline toward its recent trend. This\nmuch is unobjectionable, but they go on to argue that policymakers can be more patient\nas a result, relying on the “gravitational pull” of inflation expectations rather that interest\nrate increases that might push unemployment up. But the decline in persistence is most\nlikely a consequence of the way policy has generally responded when inflation rises. If\nso, then failing to respond is inconsistent with the expectations underlying the recent\ntendency for inflation to return to trend. This takes current expectations for granted, and\nruns the risk of eroding credibility.\nThe nature of the Phillips curve is particularly relevant to evaluating alternative policy\nstrategies for restoring price stability. Would reducing inflation require large increases in\nunemployment? Again, the key is the behavior of inflation expectations, which now seem\nto hover between 2 and 2 ½ percent, a bit below inflation itself. If expectations are\nbackward-looking, tied to past experience, one might favor a very gradual decline in\ninflation so as to minimize the effect on unemployment. Forward-looking expectations,\nhowever, suggest a strategy of attempting to influence expectations directly through clear\nand forceful communications. If such a communication strategy were successful, a more\n\n7\n\n\frapid return to price stability would be feasible and would require less policy tightening\nthan would otherwise be the case.\nHow responsive to policymaker influence are inflation expectations? General\nprescriptions are unlikely, because results will depend on the nature of central bank\nactions and communication, and the context in which they are received. There are many\nexamples of significant shifts in expectations induced by convincing people of a break\nfrom past practice. Examples include the fiscal reforms accompanying the ends of\nhyperinflations, the governance changes accompanying the adoption of explicit inflation\nobjectives, and the operational regime shift adopted by the Volcker FOMC in 1979. In\nmany recent instances, FOMC actions or statements have induced short run movements\nin market participants’ expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate and\ninflation. Although there may be no precise historical analogs for potential\ncommunications and actions to restore price stability in circumstances like the present\nday, these examples suggest that significant shifts in inflation expectations are possible.\nIn any case, the centrality of inflation expectations in the modern Phillips curve\nreinforces the importance of consistency and credibility in monetary policy making, since\nthese are traits that reduce people’s uncertainty about future policy and stabilize expected\ninflation. It suggests that central banks should not take inflation expectations for granted\nby acting in ways that are inconsistent with expectations but assuming expectations will\nnot change. Moreover, central banks should guard against underestimating the degree to\nwhich they are capable of influencing the evolution of inflation expectations.

            "content": "Community Affairs Research Conference – Opening Remarks\n5th Annual Community Affairs Research Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 29, 2007\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve System, I would like to add my welcome to the fifth\nCommunity Affairs Research Conference. These biennial meetings are a unique\nopportunity for academics, policy makers and community development professionals to\ngather together and consider new research findings that can inform our judgments on a\nvariety of issues. I applaud the organizers for compiling such an interesting and\nprovocative program.\nThis year’s conference, on the financing of community development, focuses squarely on\nthe ability of credit markets to deliver benefits to a broad spectrum of borrowers. This\ntopic could not be more timely. The slowdown in the housing market we experienced in\n2006, together with the increase in delinquencies on recent-vintage adjustable rate\nsubprime mortgages has brought the difficulties experienced by many subprime\nborrowers and lenders into the spotlight. This has led some observers to question whether\nthe expansion of credit we have experienced in recent years has been beneficial at all.\nThe passionate commentary that these developments have provoked highlights, I believe,\nthe value of careful, objective research on consumer financial markets.\nI have spoken elsewhere of the secular expansion of consumer credit, including mortgage\ncredit, and have argued that it has been the result of a broad wave of innovation. The\nevidence strongly suggests that most of this expansion of credit can be accounted for by\nfalling transaction costs associated with lending and borrowing. 1 If instead consumer\ncredit rose because of attitudinal shifts that reduced consumers’ aversion to debt, then we\nwould have seen rising risk premia (the additional interest rate consumers pay to cover\ndefault risk), which is contradicted by the evidence that risk premia have been trending\ndown over the last several decades.\nThe cost reductions that have driven the growth of consumer credit can best be\nunderstood as the result of improvements in the ability of lenders to collate and analyze\ninformation about consumers, which in turn has allowed lenders to differentiate more\nfinely among borrowers. As innovations progress, the allocation of credit moves “down\nthe demand curve.” The new borrowers brought into the market by these developments\nwill, on the whole, have higher than average risks.\nFinancial innovation, like other sorts of innovation, creates opportunities for people to do\nthings that they previously could not do. But innovation is also risky. There will\ninevitably be some uncertainty about the outcome of offering a new loan product, or of\n\n1\n\n\foffering a loan product to a new set of borrowers. In some cases, loan losses will fall\nshort of expectations. In other cases, loan losses will exceed expectations. Either way,\nlenders will engage in some amount of experimentation and learning over time, as with\nany new product rollout.\nSome borrowers, too, will at times be uncertain about how suitable a new lending product\nis for them. New financial arrangements will be unfamiliar and hard to understand for\nsome users, and there inevitably will be some amount of learning required to use them\nappropriately. New classes of borrowers drawn into the market by innovative lending\npractices – first-time homeowners for example – may be less prepared to evaluate\nintricate mortgage products. So financial innovation might generate more frequent\nmistakes by borrowers, particularly when the new products and practices are more\ncomplex than the old. This problem is exacerbated to the extent that disclosure\nrequirements are not well adapted to the new products and critical contractual features are\nburied in fine print.\nThese same conditions of uncertainty about innovations also create opportunities for the\nintentional exploitation of consumers’ unfamiliarity. These opportunities may be even\nmore prevelant in the case of innovative loan products, because of their complexity, than\nfor other services or goods. As financial innovation expands the set of borrowers and the\nvariety of borrowing instruments, unscrupulous lending and outright fraud may become\nmore prevalent.\nSo there are really four interrelated narratives for explaining why an expansion of credit\nis followed by a rise in delinquencies and defaults – new classes of borrowers are\ngenuinely higher risk, lenders may have difficulty assessing the risks associated with new\nproducts, new borrowers may be more prone to making mistakes with unfamiliar\nfinancial products, and new borrowers may be more vulnerable to exploitation and\nabusive practices. One important challenge for research in this area is to devise ways of\ndetermining the relative contributions of these factors to the market outcomes we\nobserve. This is a difficult task, and one on which researchers have to date made limited\nprogress. But the evident interest of the public in these issues implies that the social value\nof such research would be high.\nNote that these four perspectives on the expansion of consumer credit have distinctly\ndifferent policy implications. This isn’t the occasion to go into these implications in any\ndepth, but I will say that, in my opinion, the growth and development of the financial\nliteracy of our general population has lagged behind the evolution of the financial\nmarkets they encounter. Everyone involved in the retail credit industry – policymakers,\nbankers, and industry critics alike – has an interest in increasing consumers'\nunderstanding of financial products and skill at managing their financial affairs. The\nFederal Reserve is strongly committed to the goal of improved financial literacy and\nbetter consumer understanding of financial market opportunities and risks. Financially\nliterate consumers choose more wisely and make markets more effective.\n\n2\n\n\fIn my opening remarks to the 2005 conference, I included one of my pet appeals to the\nresearch community. I talked about the essential value of research that sheds light on\nborrowing and other household financial decisions from an ex ante point of view. This\ndoes not mean that we should ignore the ex post outcomes – including adverse outcomes\n– resulting from household participation in credit markets. Rather, it means that we\nshould try to get as complete a picture as possible of the full distribution of outcomes,\nand the relative likelihood of those outcomes. This is the only coherent way to understand\nwhether any particular choice made by a consumer was reasonable at the time and\nwhether any particular credit market product or practice is beneficial on net. Moreover,\nsuch a perspective is essential for evaluating proposed measures to reduce the incidence\nof adverse outcomes. If, as is sometimes the case, such measures restrict the availability\nof credit to borrowers who would not have suffered adverse outcomes, then one faces a\ntrade-off. Does the benefit of preventing adverse outcomes for some outweigh the cost of\nrestricting beneficial credit to others? We would do well to recognize the limits to our\nability to make such judgments.\nThis is really just another way of saying that we should seek to understand credit market\nbehavior in the context of a broader field of study, which John Campbell has labeled\nhousehold finance in his presidential address to the American Finance Association.\nHousehold finance is the study of the full range of consumer savings and borrowing\ndecisions and seeks to understand them in the context of the theory of a consumer trying\nto maximize the lifetime benefits of the consumption of goods and services, under\nconditions of uncertainty about the course of income over his or her lifetime.\nMuch of the work to be presented here over the next two days adds to our understanding\nof the distribution of outcomes from household financial behavior, both from the point of\nview of households themselves and from the point of view of lenders’ credit granting and\npricing decisions. This relates to another theme I sounded at the last conference. It is\npeople, not neighborhoods or loans, that matter to our assessment of the effectiveness of\ncredit markets. One implication of this premise is that viewing credit markets through the\nlens of lender data would always be inherently limiting, because such datasets do not, by\nthemselves, provide information about outcomes of household credit market experiences.\nI commented two years ago that further refinements of HMDA data were unlikely to\nyield information that is of much use in making inferences about the well-being of\nindividual households or the effectiveness of credit markets. Although the new HMDA\npricing data have produced some fascinating information, I view the experience with that\ndata thus far as confirming my earlier pessimism about the policy usefulness of expanded\nquantities of such lender-supplied data.\nWhile longitudinal data on household financial experiences is obviously ideal, a\npotentially worthwhile alternative research strategy would be to collaborate with credit\nrating bureaus in ways that respect the privacy of individual consumers and the\nproprietary interests of the companies. This could be particularly valuable because the\nfiles underlying credit scores and lending decisions comprise much of the borrowerspecific information that is missing from studies based on lending-outcomes data, like the\nHMDA reports. Merging these files with household data from other sources would\n\n3\n\n\fprovide a much more consumer-centric and policy-relevant view of credit markets. My\nunderstanding is that there is work of this type under way at the Board of Governors.\nSuch problems with measurement present formidable challenges to the field of household\nfinance, which is to say they represent opportunities for productive further research. I am\nreasonably confident that the community of dispassionate researchers and practitioners\nwill find new and innovative ways of shedding light on borrower and lender behavior,\nand will thereby further our understanding of the costs and benefits of market practices\nand government interventions. The fact that popular policy discussions in this area are so\nprone to error also points to the social value of good solid research.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we are deeply committed to understanding the functioning and\neffectiveness of the financial sector. Credit markets clearly play an important role in\ncommunity development. The Community Affairs offices of the Federal Reserve Banks\nwere founded to gather and disseminate information about community development, and\nto foster contacts between lenders and community organizations. As the community\ndevelopment industry has grown and matured, it seems natural for the Fed’s Community\nAffairs functions to focus increasingly on promoting and disseminating good credible\nresearch into the fundamental forces that affect the credit market behavior and the wellbeing of the people who make up the communities of interest. Conferences like these\nplay a constructive and vital role in that endeavor. So I will watch the work discussed at\nthis and future conferences with great interest.\n\nJohn Weinberg contributed to these remarks.\n1\n\nAthreya, \"Shame as it ever was: Stigma and Personal Bankruptcy\" Richmond Fed EQ, Spring 2004 Vol\n90 No 2.\n\n4\n\n\f",

            "content": "U. S. Monetary Policy Forum 2007\nMarch 9, 2007\nUnderstanding the Evolving Inflation Process\n\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nI have to admit that I was apprehensive when Steve and Anil asked me to participate in this\nForum and comment on a report on inflation dynamics, especially when I found out that one of\nthe authors was going to be an old friend, Mark Watson. Mark is a pre-eminent time-series\neconometrician, so my first thought was that I was going to need to brush up on unit-root\nasymptotics. When the report arrived, however, I was pleasantly surprised to find a wide-ranging\nand insightful review of the historical behavior of inflation in the G-7 countries along with a\nthoughtful examination of alternative explanations of those dynamics. I think the Report makes a\nvery useful contribution to applied monetary economics and illuminates well some of the key\nchallenges in monetary policy today. The usual disclaimer applies here, however; the views I\nexpress are my own and not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nA glance at historical plots of G-7 inflation strongly suggests that the dynamics have changed\nover time in consequential ways. Section 3 of the Report provides a clear and parsimonious way\nof characterizing changes in the dynamic behavior of inflation. Estimating the standard timeinvariant autoregressive process clearly would leave little scope for understanding how inflation\ndynamics might have evolved over time.\nThe usual method of stepping away from the standard time-invariant approach is to look for\nshifts from one fixed regime to another at discrete points in time. The authors set off in a\ndifferent direction, however, one that allows more range of variation in the underlying dynamics\nand is more agnostic about the timing of transitions. They decompose inflation into a timevarying trend and a transitory component, where both components are allowed to have timevarying volatilities. The results confirm in a very precise way our general sense of what's\nhappened with inflation over the last 40 years: There was a broad increase in trend inflation and\ninflation volatility in the 1970s followed by a return to more stable behavior in the decades since.\nThe authors show that the rise and decline was sharp and synchronized across the G-7 countries.\nMoreover, their technique attributes much of the observed rise in inflation volatility in the 1970s\nto increased volatility in the inflation trend. Trend inflation, of course, is always and everywhere\na monetary phenomenon, so to me these results immediately imply that the conduct of monetary\npolicy has varied substantially over this period.\n\n1\n\n\fThe author's careful modeling of the time series behavior of inflation is, by itself, of limited use\nin thinking about how alternative approaches to policy-making might alter inflation behavior. To\ndo this, a structural model is required — that is, a model in which the parameters do not vary\nwhen one varies the conduct of monetary policy. The authors trot out a popular workhorse\nmacroeconomic model and use it to draw some lessons from their empirical work. They do not\nfit the model to the full set of variables, which makes sense because the model has policy\nfollowing a fixed reaction function, and their empirical analysis indicates that inflation dynamics\nhave undergone significant shifts. Instead, they look for parameter values that allow the model to\nbest replicate the autocorrelation of the change in inflation.\n\nThe authors' focus on the autocorrelation properties of inflation is motivated by recent research\nsuggesting that inflation has become less persistent since the early 1980s. Some observers have\nsuggested that the decline in measured persistence implies that inflation will moderate more\nrapidly in the next year or two than would otherwise be the case. The model calibrations reported\nhere, however, demonstrate the extent to which the autocorrelation properties of inflation depend\non how monetary policy is conducted. (See Figure 6.3, for example.) This implies that\npolicymakers should be quite wary of interpreting the fall in persistence since the 1980s as\nsomething monetary policy can exploit. If persistence has declined because policy now responds\nmore strongly to inflation, for example, achieving a more rapid moderation in inflation may\nrequire tighter policy.\nThe reported model calibrations strongly suggest that inflation expectations are forward-looking.\nWhat does this mean? One of the equations of the workhorse model links current inflation to a\nmeasure of real marginal cost (or real activity) and people's expectations of future inflation. This\nis commonly referred to as a \"Phillips Curve\" and it was prominently featured last month in a\nfront-page article in the Wall Street Journal. A key question regarding the modern Phillips Curve\nis how people form expectations regarding future inflation. The conventional approach to this\nquestion is to assume that a fraction of prices in the economy are set by forward-looking agents\nthat make their best current estimate of future inflation, while other prices are set based on a\nbackward-looking moving average of recent inflation experience, and then to let the data tell you\nthe appropriate weight to put on backward-looking price-setting. Common estimates are that\naround 25 percent of agents form expectations in a backward-looking fashion. The authors find\nthat their model fits the data much better if price-setters are nearly entirely forward-looking, in\nthe sense that the fraction of prices set by backward-looking agents must be quite low — close to\nzero.\nBy itself, this evidence might not convince a skeptic. I say that because the stylized fact they\nseek to match — the autocorrelation of changes in inflation, not the autocorrelation in inflation\n— does not strike me as a sharply-drawn fact. It's just one correlation among many in the time\nseries, and one could expect more robust results by fitting the model to more dimensions of the\n2\n\n\fdata. Fortunately, there is a burgeoning literature that does just that. A series of recent papers\nestimate full structural models of the type from which the reduced-form workhorse model is\nderived, and they consistently point to less backward-looking behavior than is found in singleequation estimates of the Phillips Curve. (Lubik and Schorfheide 2004, Rabanal and RubioRamirez 2005)\nWhile it may be too soon to declare this research issue entirely settled, my sense is that the\npreponderance of empirical evidence suggests that price setting is predominantly forwardlooking. Why does this matter? Common implementations of models with forward-looking price\nsetting endow people in addition with a great deal of information about prospective policy\nsetting. The typical assumption is that people see the central bank as following a policy\nalgorithm in which trend inflation is a fixed, time-invariant parameter. A \"Taylor Rule\" is a\npopular example in which inflation is always expected to return to a target that is widely known\nand constant. In contrast, I am persuaded that at times there are aspects of policy-making,\nincluding trend inflation, about which the public is uncertain. This is consistent with the main\nassumption underlying the authors' decomposition of inflation into trend and transitory\ncomponents; namely that the conduct of monetary policy evolves over time, and that the future\nevolution of that conduct is, at times, subject to significant uncertainty.\nThe notion of uncertainty about the future conduct of monetary policy might seem strange in an\nera in which inflation expectations are often characterized as \"anchored.\" But there is uncertainty\nand then there is uncertainty. I am fairly confident that the public places an extremely low\nprobability on the Federal Reserve allowing inflation to average 10 percent over the next decade.\n(Presumably one could document this using financial market data, though I have not done so.)\nOn the other hand, I suspect that market participants place some probability on inflation\nremaining at around where it is now — a 2 ¼ percent core PCE price index, for example —\nrather than moderating to 1 ½ percent. In that sense, one might question whether inflation\nexpectations are anchored close enough to the price stability shore. Three-quarters of a percent\nmight seem like a relatively small difference in inflation rates, but sustained over a decade or\ntwo, it would amount to a material difference in purchasing power.\nActual measures of inflation expectations can provide some evidence on this question. The\nReport examines survey and other measures of inflation expectations and shows that they do a\npoor job at predicting inflation trends in the period after the Inflation Moderation of the mid1980s. Unfortunately, the market for inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury securities is not old enough\nto allow fruitful empirical tests using measures of the inflation compensation implied by nominal\nTreasury yields. Casual inspection of fluctuations in implied inflation compensation, however,\nsuggests larger and more frequent movements in inflation expectations than displayed by surveybased measures. Moreover, the observed volatility in implied inflation compensation many years\nahead seems inconsistent with a world in which the central bank's inflation objective is a fixed,\ntime-invariant parameter.\n3\n\n\fThe inability to forecast trend inflation using available measures of inflation expectations leads\nthe authors to caution policymakers against relying too heavily on them. The Report does not say\nthat inflation expectations are unimportant to the determination of inflation — their calibration\nexercise argues exactly the opposite, in fact — only that our available measures provide\nimperfect indicators. The stability of expectations measures, the authors argue, might mask\npotential instability in actual inflation expectations. With this I wholeheartedly agree; as I noted\na moment ago, one can see measures of inflation expectations as in some sense \"anchored\"\nwithout being either satisfied with where they are anchored or sanguine about their stability.\nThe broader lesson to take away from this Report is that inflation dynamics have evolved\nsignificantly over the last 50 years, and inflation expectations appear to be forward-looking. To\nagain paraphrase the late Milton Friedman, inflation is always and everywhere an expectational\nphenomenon. The intuition should be clear: the current value of money depends on value people\nexpect it to have in the near future, and thus the current inflation rate depends critically on what\npeople expect inflation to be in the near future. To put it another way, inflation expectations are\nan outcome of monetary policy, not an autonomous help or hindrance. Central banks are as\nresponsible for the behavior of inflation expectations as they are for the behavior of inflation.\nThe relevance of these lessons is well illustrated, I believe, by recent experience. On several\noccasions in the last few years, market participants have shown some uncertainty about how the\nFed would respond to sharply higher energy prices. For example, following the heavy hurricane\nseason of 2005, energy prices surged, policy expectations initially softened and measures of\ninflation expectations rose. Shortly thereafter core inflation also increased. Expectations were\nsubsequently realigned after a number speeches and statements by FOMC members, but similar\nsequences occurred in early 2004 and the spring of 2006. Now there is no intrinsic reason why\nenergy price increases need to cause core prices to accelerate. Relative prices change all the time\nin a healthy dynamic economy, and price stability means that the average price level is not\nmaterially affected.\nThese recent examples of core inflation following movements in energy prices seem to reflect\nfluctuations in the public's beliefs about the current and future conduct of monetary policy, and\nthus about trend inflation. In a world where expectations are in play, the cost of bringing\ninflation down depends on one's ability to move expectations, and thus it matters a great deal\nwhether inflation expectations are viewed as a policy outcome or an independent process. If\nexpectations are backward-looking, policymakers naturally will be less forceful about returning\ninflation to a desired rate. If expectations are forward-looking, a central bank has the opportunity\nto move expectations in the right direction through clear communication reinforced by\nappropriate actions, and a more rapid return to price stability would be warranted. In my view,\nthis Report, along with abundant other recent research in monetary economics, clearly points in\nthe direction of forward-looking price setting. We should not, therefore, underestimate our\ncapacity to influence the public's understanding of the conduct of policy.\n4\n\n\f",

            "content": "Economic Outlook\nRichmond Risk Management Association\nRichmond, Virginia\nJanuary 19, 2007\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be here again this year for what has come to be called the “Broaddus\nBreakfast.” I am honored to be invited back for a third appearance. Before I begin, I owe you the\nusual disclaimer that these views are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues\naround the Federal Reserve System. But for those of you who have followed my voting record,\nthis should come as no surprise.\nIn considering the economic outlook, it’s important to bear in mind the broader transition that is\ntaking place. In the three-year period leading up to the middle of last year, we’ve seen above\naverage growth. Real gross domestic product – our best measure of total production in the\neconomy – grew at a 3 ¾ percent annual rate. To appreciate the strength of that performance,\nnote that the trend rate of GDP growth – by which I mean the rate consistent with trend growth\nin productivity and the labor force – is more like 3 percent. Labor market conditions improved\nsignificantly over that period, with 5.4 million new jobs created and the unemployment rate\nfalling by a full 1 ½ percentage points. With jobs increasingly plentiful, household spending\nsurged – real per capita consumption rose at a robust 2.6 percent annual rate. And even as their\nspending increased, consumers continued to build wealth; household net worth increased by 31\npercent to reach a level equal to five years of personal income.\nBut since we’re not in Lake Wobegon, we can’t be above average all the time. Indeed, in the\nsecond quarter of last year, real GDP only grew at a 2.6 percent rate. In the third quarter, growth\ndropped to a 2.0 percent rate, and growth is likely to remain below average in the current\nquarter. Since growth clearly has slowed, the question on many people’s minds is, “What’s\nnext?”\nFor some guidance, we can look back to similar episodes in the past. The long expansions of the\n1980s and the 1990s resemble our current expansion in several key respects. Both were\nunusually long, by historical standards. Both saw substantial increases in production,\nemployment and wealth. And in both cycles, there was a somewhat bumpy transition between an\nearly, high-growth phase and a period of several years of more average, trend-like growth. For\nexample, the cyclical expansion of the 1990s was the longest in our nation’s history, and yet in\nthe midst of this period of strong, sustained growth, there was a two-quarter period in early 1995\nin which real GDP increased by only 0.9 percent at an annual rate, driven in part by weakness in\nhousing investment. That barely perceptible growth was followed by an additional three quarters\nof growth at a subpar rate, but then real GDP accelerated and grew quite rapidly for the next four\nyears. This example suggests that we should not be discouraged this time around by an uneven\ntransition from rapid to more sustainable growth.\n\n\fThe distinguishing feature of the current transition is the magnitude of the adjustment in the\nhousing market, which comes at the end of what has been an amazing, decade-long run. The\nhomeownership rate increased by 4 full percentage points from 1995 to 2005, and the number of\nhouses built per year increased by 46 percent over that 10-year period.\nSome observers have called this extraordinary behavior of the housing market in recent years a\nbubble. I don’t find that term useful or particularly accurate, since the behavior of housing\nappears to have been based on solid fundamentals.\nFirst, there were good reasons for the homeownership rate to rise and for homeowners to spend\nmore on housing. Before 1995, the prevailing view was that productivity, and by implication\nreal per capita income, was likely to increase at about 1 percent annually. But since then, as is\nwell known, productivity growth has been dramatically higher – about 3 percent in the nonfarm\nbusiness sector, for example. People base their investment plans on current and anticipated\nincome growth, and it is not surprising that households would move increasingly from renting to\nbuying their own home.\nSecond, inflation fell to below 2 percent in the mid-1990s, and over time, financial market\nparticipants became more confident that inflation would remain low and stable; that confidence,\nin turn, led to low mortgage interest rates. Thus, at the beginning of 1995, the 30-year mortgage\nrate was above 9 percent; by 2003, it had fallen below 6 percent, reducing the relative price of\nhousing services and contributing to the increase in demand.\nSatisfying the growth in housing demand required new construction and new land. While the\nsupply of construction services appears to be fairly elastic, in some localities geography and\nzoning regulations can severely limit the supply of buildable lots. Consequently, the overall\nsupply of housing can be highly inelastic. Increases in demand in such locations generate\nsignificant price increases, and those priced out of the market look for homes in locations with\nless desirable features – for example, with longer commutes.\nThis is well illustrated within the Fifth Federal Reserve District. In Charlotte, population,\nincome and employment grew rapidly from 1995 to 2005. With ample supplies of usable land,\n224,000 new building permits were issued, and the price of an existing home increased by a\nrelatively modest 4.2 percent per year. The Washington, D.C., area also had rapid growth in\npopulation, income and employment; and 395,000 new houses were built. Unlike Charlotte,\nhowever, the supply of new lots was much more limited in the Washington area, and\naccordingly the average price of an existing home increased 10 percent per year from 1995 to\n2005. Richmond’s experience has been in between those of Charlotte and Washington.\nThe secular increase in housing demand in recent years was apparently satisfied in many\nmarkets by the end of 2005. Nationwide, new home sales have fallen by 23 percent through\nNovember of last year. The pipeline of new projects under construction was not scaled back as\nrapidly, however, and we now have excess inventories of new and existing homes in most\nlocalities. Production of new homes will have to undershoot demand for a time in order to work\noff the backlog. Indeed, new housing starts have fallen 24 percent through November. The\ninventory overhang that remains suggests that homebuilding will be below demand for several\nmore months.\n2\n\n\fLooking ahead, there are tentative signs that the demand for housing has stabilized. New home\nsales have bumped around the 1 million unit annual rate for the last several months, and new\npurchase mortgage applications have risen over 12 percent since the late summer. If these\ntentative signs are confirmed by more complete data, then new home construction only needs to\nlag new home sales long enough to work off the current bulge in inventories. I would expect\nhousing starts to realign with sales around the middle of 2007. Should new home demand\ndeteriorate instead, the adjustment could take longer.\nIn any event, the weakness in housing will continue to be a drag on overall economic activity in\nthe first half of this year, with the effect gradually waning as the year progresses. But I seriously\ndoubt it will be enough of a drag to tip the economy into recession. My doubts stem from the\nfact that residential investment accounts for about 6 percent of GDP, while household\nconsumption accounts for 70 percent, and the outlook for household spending looks quite strong\nright now. For the first three quarters of last year, consumer spending has increased at a healthy\n3.4 percent annual rate, and it looks like the fourth quarter will see something similar. That\ngrowth in spending has been underpinned by a strong labor market and solid income growth.\nLabor markets are fairly tight, overall, as indicated by the 4.5 percent unemployment rate. Real\ndisposable income increased at a strong rate in the third quarter, and there are signs that real\nwage gains are improving – wages and salaries, as measured by the employment cost index,\nincreased at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the second and third quarters, the best two-quarter\nincrease in almost five years.\nCould weakness in the housing market spill over and weaken consumption spending as well? As\nresidential investment contracts, construction employment will certainly decline. So far,\nresidential construction employment has shed 134,000 jobs since the peak in February. At the\nsame time, however, other segments of the economy have been doing well and overall payrolls\nactually expanded by 1.5 million jobs. This again reflects the small size of the residential\nconstruction sector relative to the overall economy. Although the outlook is for construction\nemployment to continue to weaken for at least several more months, a decline commensurate\nwith the fall-off we’ve already seen in housing starts still would have only a minor effect on\ntotal employment.\nAs I have said before, consumer spending is largely determined by current and expected future\nincome prospects. Consumer incomes, in turn, will depend on job market conditions. I expect\nthe overall job market to continue to expand, even after accounting for further job losses in\nhomebuilding. It’s worth noting that even as GDP growth slowed in the last half of 2006, the\neconomy generated 160,000 new jobs per month, on average. That compares favorably with the\n120,000 new jobs per month that would be needed to simply keep pace with population growth.\nThe rapid growth in hiring pushed the unemployment rate down to a low 4.5 percent, and also\nallowed the labor force participation rate to increase modestly. The tight labor market has also\nled to healthy wage gains. Last year, the rate of growth in average hourly earnings increased by\na full percentage point. I expect the labor market to remain tight, and therefore expect solid wage\nand salary growth this year. Thus, with income prospects looking good for 2007, it seems a\npretty safe bet that consumer spending will do well, and again, that’s by far the largest part of\nthe economy.\n\n3\n\n\fWe’ve discussed residential investment, but what about business investment spending? Here the\nfundamentals look favorable as well. Business profitability is high and the cost of capital is low.\nIn many industries, demand looks strong and capacity utilization is high. With these\nfundamentals in mind, it should be no surprise that real business investment grew at a robust 9.3\npercent annual rate in the first three quarters of 2006. Especially noteworthy was investment in\nnonresidential structures, which increased at a remarkable 14.8 percent annual rate over that\ntime period. Some leaders in new construction were hospitals, which increased 15 percent;\noffices, which increased 20 percent; stores, which increased 21 percent; and hotels, which\nincreased 47 percent. Adding to this momentum in new nonresidential construction, many\nanalysts expect to see a burst of new investment in computers and related products as the new\nMicrosoft operating system is adopted in homes and offices. All in all, it seems reasonable to\nexpect business investment to continue to contribute positively to growth in overall economic\nactivity.\nThe outlook for real growth in 2007, then, is for continued strength in consumer spending and\nbusiness investment to be partially offset, particularly early this year, by the drag from the\nhousing market. Growth will start the year on the low side, but should be back to about 3 percent\nby the end of the year. So my best guess right now is that real GDP growth will average between\n2 ½ and 2 ¾ percent in 2007. A month or two ago, this forecast would have been somewhat\nhigher than the consensus of widely quoted analysts. But the data since then have been stronger\nthan most observers expected, particularly the very robust data on consumer spending and\nemployment. As a result, many analysts have marked up their forecasts, and so the projections\nI’ve presented today are now fairly mainstream.\nTwo risks to this outlook deserve mention. First, it’s impossible to be sure that housing demand\ntruly has stabilized, so one downside risk is of a further deterioration in the housing market.\nHowever, we don’t see any signs of this now. Second, I’ll note again the substantial uncertainty\nsurrounding oil prices. This is likely to be with us for some time to come, and it cuts both ways,\nas our recent experience has demonstrated.\nWhat about inflation? Last year was disappointing on this score as well. Inflation, according to\nour generally preferred measure – the core PCE price index – has been running above 2 percent\nsince early 2004, and has run 2.3 percent through November of last year. Forecasters have been\nhoping for a moderation in core inflation, but until recently evidence of such moderation was\nscant. The November inflation reports, however, have provided some tentative evidence\nsuggesting a moderating trend. For example, the three-month average rate of change in the core\nPCE price index fell to 1.8 percent in November. That inflation measure has exhibited\nsubstantial oscillations, however – it fell to 1.8 percent in February of last year before rising to\n2.9 percent within three months when energy prices surged. In view of the recent record, it will\ntake several months worth of data to provide statistically convincing evidence of a moderation in\ninflation. In the meantime, the risk that core inflation surges again, or does not subside as\ndesired, clearly remains the predominant macroeconomic policy risk.\nLet me add a footnote here regarding wage rates and the inflation outlook. Some observers have\nviewed robust wage growth as a cause of inflationary pressures; I do not share that view. We can\nhave healthy wage growth without inflation as long as we see commensurate growth in labor\nproductivity. In fact, over time, real (inflation-adjusted) compensation tracks productivity\n4\n\n\fgrowth fairly well, though they do not move in lockstep from quarter to quarter. I would note\nthat the rate of growth of productivity shifted higher beginning in the middle of the 1990s, and\nwhile productivity is hard to forecast, I believe that reasonably strong productivity gains will\ncontinue and will warrant reasonably strong real wage gains. What would concern me – and we\nhave not seen this as yet – would be a persistent increase in wage growth that was not matched\nby a commensurate increase in productivity growth. Ultimately this would result in higher\ninflation.\nAgain, thank you. It’s been a pleasure to be here.\n\n5\n\n\f",

            "content": "Economic Outlook\nAnnual Economic Conference\nCharlotte Chamber of Commerce\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nDecember 21, 2006\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be here in Charlotte again this year for the Annual Economic\nConference. I am honored to be invited back for a third appearance, particularly after my\nforecasting performance last year. Before I begin, I owe you the usual disclaimer that\nthese views are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues around the\nFederal Reserve System. For those of you who have followed my voting record, however,\nthis should come as no surprise.\nIn considering the economic outlook, it’s important to bear in mind the broader transition\nthat is taking place. In the three-year period leading up to the middle of this year, we’ve\nseen above average growth. Real gross domestic product – our best measure of total\nproduction in the economy – grew at a 3 ¾ percent annual rate. To appreciate the strength\nof that performance, note that the trend rate of GDP growth – by which I mean the rate\nconsistent with trend growth in productivity and the labor force – is more like 3 percent.\nLabor market conditions improved significantly over that period, with 5.4 million new\njobs created and the unemployment rate falling by a full 1 ½ percentage points. With jobs\nincreasingly plentiful, household spending surged – real per capita consumption rose at a\nrobust 2.6 percent annual rate. And even as their spending increased, consumers\ncontinued to build wealth; household net worth increased by 31 percent to reach a level\nequal to 5 years of personal income.\nBut since we’re not in Lake Wobegon, we can’t be above average all the time. Indeed, in\nthe second quarter of this year real GDP only grew at a 2.6 percent rate. In the third\nquarter, growth dropped to a 2.2 percent rate, and growth is likely to be about the same,\nor perhaps a bit higher in the current quarter. Since growth clearly has slowed, the\nquestion on many people’s minds is, “What’s next?”\nFor some guidance, we can look back to similar episodes in the past. The long expansions\nof the 1980s and the 1990s resemble our current expansion in several key respects. Both\nwere unusually long, by historical standards. Both saw substantial increases in\nproduction, employment and wealth. And in both cycles there was a somewhat bumpy\ntransition between an early, high-growth phase and a period of several years of more\naverage, trend-like growth. For example, the cyclical expansion of the 1990s was the\nlongest in our nation’s history, and yet in the midst of this period of strong, sustained\ngrowth, there was a two-quarter period in early 1995 in which real GDP increased by\nonly 0.9 percent at an annual rate, driven in part by weakness in housing investment. That\n\n\fbarely perceptible growth was followed by an additional three quarters of growth at a\nsubpar rate, but then real GDP accelerated and grew quite rapidly for the next four years.\nThis example suggests that we should not be discouraged this time around by an uneven\ntransition from rapid to more sustainable growth.\nThe distinguishing feature of the current transition is the magnitude of the adjustment in\nthe housing market, which comes at the end of what has been an amazing, decade-long\nrun. The homeownership rate increased by 4 full percentage points from 1995 to 2005,\nand the number of houses built per year increased by 46 percent over that 10-year period.\nSome observers have called this extraordinary behavior of the housing market in recent\nyears a bubble. I don’t find that term useful or particularly accurate, since the behavior of\nhousing appears to have been based on solid fundamentals.\nFirst, there were good reasons for the homeownership rate to rise and for homeowners to\nspend more on housing. Before 1995, the prevailing view was that productivity, and by\nimplication real per capita income, was likely to increase at about 1 percent annually. But\nsince then, as is well known, productivity growth has been dramatically higher – about 3\npercent in the nonfarm business sector, for example. People base their investment plans\non current and anticipated income growth, and it is not surprising that households would\nmove increasingly from renting to buying their own home.\nSecond, inflation fell to below 2 percent in the mid-1990s, and over time financial market\nparticipants became more confident that inflation would remain low and stable; that\nconfidence, in turn, led to low mortgage interest rates. Thus, at the beginning of 1995, the\n30-year mortgage rate was above 9 percent; by 2003, it had fallen below 6 percent,\nreducing the relative price of housing services and contributing to the increase in demand.\nSatisfying the growth in housing demand required new construction and new land.\nWhile the supply of construction services appears to be fairly elastic, in some localities\ngeography and zoning regulations can severely limit the supply of buildable lots.\nConsequently, the overall supply of housing can be highly inelastic. Increases in demand\nin such locations generate significant price increases, and those priced out of the market\nlook for homes in locations with less desirable features – for example, with longer\ncommutes.\nThis is well illustrated within the Fifth Federal Reserve District. In Charlotte, population,\nincome, and employment grew rapidly from 1995 to 2005. With ample supplies of usable\nland, 224,000 new building permits were issued, and the price of an existing home\nincreased by a relatively modest 4.2 percent per year. The Washington, D.C., area also\nhad rapid growth in population, income, and employment; and 395,000 new houses were\nbuilt. Unlike Charlotte, however, the supply of new lots was more limited in the\nWashington area, and accordingly the average price of an existing home increased 10\npercent per year from 1995 to 2005.\n\n-2-\n\n\fThe secular increase in housing demand in recent years was apparently satisfied in many\nmarkets by the end of 2005. Nationwide, new home sales have fallen by 22 percent\nthrough October of this year. The pipeline of new projects under construction was not\nscaled back as rapidly, however, and we now have excess inventories of new and existing\nhomes in most localities. Production of new homes will have to undershoot demand for a\ntime in order to work off the backlog. Indeed, new housing starts have fallen 28 percent\nthrough November of this year. The inventory overhang that remains suggests that\nhomebuilding will be below demand for several more months.\nLooking ahead, there are tentative signs that the demand for housing has stabilized. New\nhome sales have bumped around the 1 million unit annual rate for the last four months,\nand new purchase mortgage applications have risen over 15 percent in the last seven\nweeks. If these tentative signs are confirmed by more complete data then new home\nconstruction only needs to lag new home sales long enough to work off the current bulge\nin inventories. In this scenario, I would expect housing starts to realign with sales around\nthe middle of 2007. Should new home demand deteriorate instead, the adjustment could\ntake longer.\nIn any event, the weakness in housing will continue to be a drag on overall economic\nactivity into the first half of next year, with the effect gradually waning as the year\nprogresses. But I seriously doubt it will be enough of a drag to tip the economy into\nrecession. My doubts stem from the fact that residential investment accounts for 6 percent\nof GDP, while household consumption accounts for 70 percent, and the outlook for that\nspending looks quite strong right now. For the first three quarters of this year, consumer\nspending has increased at a healthy 3.4 percent annual rate, and it looks like the fourth\nquarter will see something similar. That growth in spending has been underpinned by a\nstrong labor market and solid income growth. Labor markets are fairly tight, overall, as\nindicated by the 4.5 percent unemployment rate. Real disposable income increased at a\nstrong rate in the third quarter, and there are signs that real wage gains are improving –\nwages and salaries, as measured by the employment cost index, increased at a 3.8 percent\nannual rate in the second and third quarters, the best two-quarter increase in almost five\nyears.\nCould weakness in the housing market spillover and weaken consumption spending as\nwell? As residential investment contracts, construction employment will certainly\ndecline. So far, residential construction employment has shed 110,000 jobs since the peak\nin February. At the same time, however, other segments of the economy have been doing\nwell and overall payrolls actually expanded by 1.2 million jobs. This again reflects the\nsmall size of the residential construction sector relative to the overall economy. Although\nthe outlook is for construction employment to continue to weaken for at least several\nmore months, a decline commensurate with the fall-off we’ve already seen in housing\nstarts still would have only a minor effect on total employment.\nAs I have said before, consumer spending is largely determined by current and expected\nfuture income prospects. I expect the overall job market to continue to expand even after\naccounting for further job losses in homebuilding, and I expect the tight labor market to\n\n-3-\n\n\fcontinue to generate healthy wage gains. With income prospects looking good for 2007,\nit seems a pretty safe bet that consumer spending will do well, and again that’s by far the\nlargest part of the economy.\nWe’ve discussed residential investment, but what about business investment spending?\nHere the fundamentals look favorable. Business profitability is high and the cost of\ncapital is low. In many industries, demand looks strong and capacity utilization is high.\nSo, I would expect business investment to continue to contribute positively to growth in\noverall economic activity.\nThe outlook for real growth in 2007, then, is for continued strength in consumer spending\nand business investment to be partially offset, particularly early next year, by the drag\nfrom the housing market. Growth will start the year on the low side, but should be back\nto about 3 percent by the end of next year. So my best guess right now is that real GDP\ngrowth will average between 2 ½ and 2 ¾ percent in 2007.\nTwo risks to this outlook deserve mention. First, it’s impossible to be sure that housing\ndemand truly has stabilized, so one downside risk is of a further deterioration in the\nhousing market. However, we don’t see any signs of this now. Second, I’ll note again the\nsubstantial uncertainty surrounding oil prices. This is likely to be with us for some time to\ncome, and it cuts both ways, as our experience this fall demonstrated.\nWhat about inflation? The past year has been disappointing on this score as well.\nInflation, according to our generally preferred measure – the core PCE price index –has\nbeen running above 2 percent since early 2004, and has run 2.5 percent so far this year.\nThe longer core inflation persists above 2 percent, the greater the danger of inflation\nbecoming entrenched at too high a rate.\nMany forecasters have been saying core inflation will moderate in the near term, and this\ncertainly would be desirable. But such a moderation is not yet evident, despite the two\nmost recent CPI reports. For example, the three-month average rate of change in the core\nPCE price index has been oscillating between 1.8 percent and 2.9 percent since last year’s\nhurricanes, and stands at 2.7 percent as of October. In view of this recent record, it would\ntake several months worth of data to provide statistically convincing evidence of a\nmoderation in inflation. In the meantime, the risk that core inflation surges again, or does\nnot subside as desired, clearly remains the predominant macroeconomic policy risk.\nAgain, thank you. It’s been a pleasure to be here.\n\n-4-\n\n\f",

            "content": "How Should Regulators Respond to Financial Innovation?\nThe Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nDecember 1, 2006\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nThe subject of this panel is “Financial Markets and Growth.” There is now quite a\nsubstantial literature devoted to understanding how improvements in the effectiveness of\nthe financial sector can and do contribute to growth and economic well-being in\ndeveloping countries. My focus will be on the innovations in financial markets and\npractices that have been particularly striking in the United States over the last couple of\ndecades, and the key benefits of those innovations. We’ve seen tremendous changes in\nfinancial arrangements in recent years, particularly with regard to the ways in which\nfinancial markets allocate risk; derivative markets have made risks increasingly divisible\nand tradable, and consumers have seen vastly expanded opportunities in credit markets. I\nbelieve these changes have produced noteworthy economic benefits. Many observers,\nhowever, acknowledge the benefits but believe the recent wave of financial innovation\nalso has contributed to increasing financial fragility. The proliferation of new instruments\nseems to have made it easier for someone to accumulate large risk exposures and harder\nfor counterparties to evaluate them.\nIn my remarks today, I will offer up the perspective of an economic policymaker from a\nmore developed country, out of a belief that such a perspective has at least some\nrelevance to policymakers in the developing world. I will speak at a fairly broad and\nabstract level, and will not address specific policy questions. I also will speak as an exresearch economist, which means I am entitled to leave it to others to validate or refute\nthe hypotheses I advance here.\nMy main hypothesis is that one of the most difficult challenges posed by financial\ninnovation has to do with the interplay between institutions that are relatively closely\nregulated and institutions that operate less constrained by government intervention. In\nmany developing countries, the real dilemma in financial development has been how to\nfoster growth in institutions and market segments that are more credibly distanced from\nthe government than are the institutions that have tended to be government controlled or\nprotected. In some Asian economies, for instance, the role of the banking system in\nlending to historically state-run enterprises makes it hard to liberalize the set of saving\noptions available to households, for fear of a destabilizing flight of funds from the\nbanking system.\nIn developed economies, much of the financial innovation taking place in the last 20\nyears has been associated with the movement of credit risk and other exposures off of the\nbalance sheets of regulated banks and into such less-regulated entities as hedge funds.\n\n\fThe presence of a sector that is less regulated (or, one might say, “regulated primarily via\nmarket discipline”) has proven useful as a testing ground for new financial products and\npractices, but some have argued that the ability of such entities to amass concentrated\nexposures poses a potential threat to the stability of regulated institutions.\nLet me again emphasize that I offer up just one policymaker’s views. As always, those\nviews are not necessarily shared by any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\n\nFinancial innovation\nIn my discussion of the effects of developments in financial markets, I want to focus on\nthe period since the early 1980s. I think we can look to the 1980s as a rough starting point\nfor a broad wave of innovation in financial markets and instruments, driven by advances\nin information and communication technologies. And this wave affected the financial\nopportunities of both households and businesses. On the household side, what can be\nfairly called a revolution in unsecured credit began in the 1980s and accelerated in the\n1990s. Mortgage and home equity lending also benefited in this period from the same\nfundamental forces. Falling costs of computing and telecommunications facilitated\nadvances in credit evaluation and the pricing of risk, which facilitated more finely\npartitioned credit origination decisions and improved intermediation of the resulting\nfinancial claims through securitization. Credit became available to more borrowers and\non better terms. 1\nIn the world of business finance, this period saw a significant expansion in the set of\ncontingent claims available to market participants, and a significant expansion in the set\nof claims that are actively traded in secondary markets. Derivative contracts, swaps, loan\nsales, credit derivatives and securities backed by various types of assets all proliferated\nduring this period. These developments increased the divisibility and marketability of\nspecific risks, and greatly enhanced the ability of businesses and intermediaries to\ntransfer particular risks to other market participants. For example, banks now seem to\nhave a greater ability to move corporate credit exposures off of their books and into the\nhands of other banks and, increasingly, nonbank intermediaries such as institutional\ninvestors and hedge funds. Banks, however, have remained important in the origination\nof credits and they remain major providers of lending facilities through which exposures\ncould flow back into the banking system under some circumstances.\nThe period since the early 1980s was also one of markedly diminished macroeconomic\nvolatility. This change, which has been dubbed the “great moderation,” shows up in\nvirtually all aggregate time series for real variables. For example, expansions have been\nlonger and recessions have been shallower and less frequent. This phenomenon has been\nnoted by many authors and the relevant facts were described by Chairman Bernanke in a\n2004 speech. 2\n\n1\n2\n\nLacker (2005)\nBernanke (2004)\n\n2\n\n\fThere are natural reasons to expect a connection between the performance of financial\nmarkets and the variability of real macroeconomic variables. One of the most\nfundamental economic purposes of financial markets and institutions is to facilitate\nhousehold smoothing of consumption against both life-cycle variations and unexpected\nshocks to income. In an idealized, perfectly frictionless financial market, households\nwould be able to shed all idiosyncratic risks and to achieve a consumption profile that is\nat least as smooth as average income. (Rob Townsend’s research has emphasized the\nusefulness of this idealized world as a benchmark for evaluating financial market\nperformance.) 3\nBut households’ ability to smooth consumption appears to be more limited than in such\nideal markets. Most notably, direct insurance against some of the most significant\nindividual shocks that households face – especially persistent income shocks – does not\nappear to be readily available. (Moral hazard or other informational frictions presumably\nlimit the feasibility of such insurance.) In fact, households seem to achieve much of their\nsmoothing with a relatively limited set of financial instruments. Households build up\nstocks of savings that they can draw on to smooth consumption when faced with\nunexpected reductions in income or increases in expenses. And households also smooth\nthrough such shocks by borrowing against future income.\nThe rising use of debt by U.S. households since the 1980s suggests that previously,\nborrowing was a relatively expensive tool for consumption-smoothing. If so, then one\nmight have expected households to rely somewhat more heavily on savings before the\ninnovations that reduced borrowing costs in the 1980s. As borrowing costs fell, the need\nfor savings to smooth consumption fell also. With easier access to credit, many\nhouseholds may have found themselves with more savings than they needed for\nsmoothing purposes. As access to credit and the amount of borrowing grew, one might\nhave expected household savings rates to decline. And this is exactly what happened. 4\nFinancial innovation could contribute to growth, therefore, by reducing the volatility of\nconsumption relative to income and expense shocks. While the intuition for this is\nstraightforward at the level of an individual household, the effect of improved\nconsumption-smoothing opportunities on aggregate volatility is not unambiguous. A\ndecrease in the aggregate consumption volatility associated with a given process for\nfundamental shocks could be offset by greater volatility in hours worked or through\ninvestment. A complicated set of interacting forces is at work in a general equilibrium\nsetting, and the net outcome depends on fundamentals of technology, preferences and the\nnature of the fundamental shocks. And a variety of other causes have been offered to\nexplain the macroeconomic moderation, including better monetary policy and the good\nfortune of receiving smaller shocks. Nonetheless, a causal link between the great\nmoderation and the simultaneous wave of financial innovation would seem to be a\nplausible conjecture.\n3\n\nTownsend (1987)\nWeinberg (2006) reviews trends in household borrowing, while Athreya (2004) conducts quantitative\nexercises to argue that the leading candidate for the cause of increased borrowing is falling borrowing\ncosts.\n\n4\n\n3\n\n\fThe basic story for households, then, appears to be one of reduced credit constraints\nleading to improved consumption-smoothing opportunities. A similar story might apply\nto businesses. A large literature has argued that many firms face credit constraints, and\nthat these constraints result in firms’ investment spending being more tied to available\ninternal cash flow than would otherwise be the case. Such a mechanism would have the\npotential to amplify and propagate more fundamental shocks. But if such a mechanism is\nat work, and if financial innovation has reduced borrowing costs and expanded access to\ncredit for business firms, then we would expect the amplifying effect of credit market\nconstraints to have fallen as well. This, too, could have contributed to the great\nmoderation.\nThe arguments I’ve presented here suggest that financial innovation may have a role in\nexplaining the great moderation. But these arguments do not address the concerns often\nexpressed about the volatility- or fragility-increasing effects of financial innovation. One\nline of reasoning underlying such concerns is that while financial innovation has\nenhanced the divisibility of risks and made it easier to allocate risks across a broader\narray of investors, these innovations also have facilitated greater concentrations of risk.\nThe effectiveness of markets for new financial claims depends to some extent on the\npresence of entities willing and able to arbitrage away pricing misalignments, should they\narise. That ability goes along with an ability to acquire relatively large positions in a\nrelatively narrow set of claims, and thus to accumulate substantial risk exposures. This is\narguably a good description of the role that hedge funds have come to play in financial\nmarkets. The flexibility that hedge funds have in responding to what they perceive to be\npricing misalignments stems in part from their nature as entities free of much of the\nregulation facing other financial firms. The efficiency-enhancing benefits of financial\ninnovations thus might be difficult to disentangle from the rise of less regulated\nintermediaries.\nConcerns about possible fragility-increasing effects of financial innovation tend to\nrevolve around low-frequency events – financial crises in which losses incurred by one\nfinancial market participant have repercussions for other market participants. Such events\nmight be economically costly if, for example, they caused some positive net present value\ninvestment opportunities to be missed or some ongoing, economically viable projects to\nbe shut down. Alternatively, concentration of exposures within hedge funds or other\nentities could prove complicated and costly to resolve in situations of financial distress.\nIn particular, if such a resolution were costly enough, its effects on the prices of financial\nassets might have the effect of curtailing the flow of capital to productive purposes,\nresulting in a disruption to real economic activity.\n\nTwo Views on the Role of Regulation\nTo talk about the implications of financial innovation for regulation, I think it is useful to\nfirst be clear about the underlying reasons for financial regulation. There are two broad\nviews on this question, and each tends to be associated with a corresponding view on how\n\n4\n\n\fpolicy should respond to the risks associated with the financial activities of less-regulated\nintermediaries.\nOne view sees the government financial safety net as the central motivation for the\nregulation of financial intermediaries. The safety net has the potential to distort risktaking incentives of protected institutions, and supervisory oversight attempts to prevent\nexcessive risks from accumulating in sectors supported by the safety net. In this view,\nregulators might be thought of as playing a role similar to that played by private\nproviders of insurance, financial guarantees, or other credit enhancements, who by\nvarious means monitor and constrain risk-taking by their clients.\nThe safety net reduces the incentives of private financial counterparties to manage the\nexposures they take on. And these incentive effects arise not just from such explicit\nsafety net guarantees as deposit insurance. They may also result from the expectations of\nprivate market participants about actions that the central bank or other public sector entity\nmight take during a financial crisis. The mere possibility of public sector action to stem\nso-called “systemic” losses, such as central bank lending, can provide an implicit safety\nnet that makes some participants more willing to hold concentrated exposures. Hence,\nunder this moral hazard view of the need for regulation, the safety net itself can be a\nsource of “systemic” risk. 5\nHow does the financial innovation process I have sketched affect the potential for moral\nhazard induced by the safety net? By expanding the variety of risks that a supported\ninstitution is capable of taking on, the development of new instruments could provide\nnew means to accumulate excessive exposures. Left unchecked, this could exacerbate the\nmoral-hazard costs of the safety net. Enhancements in supervisory practice in the U.S.\nand elsewhere since the early 1990s seem to have made significant progress in\nconstraining the distortionary effects of the safety net.\nThe second view, while not discounting the importance of moral hazard related to the\nsafety net, sees a more fundamental justification for regulatory intervention. In this view,\nthere are inherent market failures in financial markets – leading some risks, especially\nthose that might be labeled “systemic,” to be mispriced. Often this market failure is\nportrayed as an externality. Systemic risks are said to distort choices because a\ncounterparty does not take into account the effect of its own possible losses on its\ncounterparty’s counterparties. Alternatively, market failures are attributed to such market\nfrictions as imperfect information, the idea being that if it’s impossible to know all of the\nrisk-relevant information about a counterparty’s characteristics and past and future\nactions, then credit to that party cannot be priced as precisely as it would under full\ninformation.\nCoordination failures are a closely related type of market imperfection in which multiple\nmarket participants take the same action, such as attempting to sell a particular exposure\nor withdraw funds from an institution, causing losses to all that might have been avoided.\n5\n\nGoodfriend and Lacker (1999) examine the implications of limited commitment in central bank lending.\n\n5\n\n\fThe canonical example of a financial coordination failure is the Diamond-Dybvig bank\nrun. 6\nUnder the market failure view, the safety net acts to ameliorate friction-induced\ndistortions and coordination problems, and financial innovation raises an array of\nconcerns. Since distortions arise in the context of transactions, a dramatic rise in the\nvolume of gross transactions relative to real economic activity would raise the level of\nrisk and expand the need for safety net protection and the associated risk-taking\nconstraints. Moreover, growth in the number of distinct market-traded financial\ninstruments would multiply the potential for coordination failures. Offsetting these\nadverse effects, however, is the fact that innovation improves the ability to assess,\nmeasure and price risk, and thus could reduce the incidence of mispricing. A market\nfailure amounts to the deviation of a market price from the normative fundamental value\nof the underlying claim, as when systemic effects are undervalued and lead to wrongly\npriced risks, or when coordination failures induce “firesale” liquidations at prices below\nfundamental values. The occurrence of such mispricing relies on the inability of any\nmarket participant to recognize and act on the deviation of price from fundamental value.\nIt is exactly the ability to identify and exploit such deviations, however, that financial\ninnovation has tended to enhance.\nSo which of these two views do I align myself with? I think it is useful to bring a healthy\nskepticism to the table about the extent of inherent market failures in financial markets.\nFirst, I would point out that work some 20 years ago by my co-panelist Rob Townsend\n(together with Edward C. Prescott) made clear that information imperfections – moral\nhazard, asymmetric information, and the like – do not constitute market failures. 7 Rather,\nthe financial instruments and contracts we actually observe, and the rich variety of\ncontractual features they display, should be understood as the market’s adaptation to\ninformation limits. And the logic that says markets can allocate risk optimally subject to\ninformational constraints is essentially identical to the logic that says markets are\nefficient when there is perfect information.\nSecond, I think that the notion of “systemic risk” as an externality in the classical sense is\nfundamentally flawed. If I take on a credit-risk exposure to a counterparty who has\nmaterial exposure to another counterparty, then surely that should figure in my risk\nassessment. And similarly with that counterparty’s exposure to others, and so on. Now, it\nmight be quite costly to know everything one would like to know about one’s\ncounterparties’ counterparties. But as I’ve just argued, limits to information do not imply\na market failure.\nSkepticism regarding market failures does not imply a Panglossian stance, however.\nActual markets are complex, and are evolving in ways that are difficult to predict.\nMeasuring and assessing risk in such an environment is an intellectually challenging\nendeavor. Moreover, not all market participants will acquire sophistication and\nproficiency with new products and practices at the same pace. As a result, mistakes\n6\n7\n\nDiamond and Dybvig (1983)\nPrescott and Townsend (1984)\n\n6\n\n\finevitably will be made, some of which could result in high-profile losses to some market\nparticipants – indeed we see these with some regularity, whether in households, business\nfirms or financial institutions. The occurrence of such mistakes does not represent a form\nof market failure, but rather is an integral part of the innovation process. While market\nparticipants should certainly be encouraged to ensure that their own risk-measurement\nand risk-management practices keep pace with market developments as much as possible\n– and supervisors should certainly help in this regard with regulated financial institutions\n– reducing the probability of such mistakes to zero is unlikely to be optimal and could\nwell inhibit beneficial innovation.\n\nSo What Should Regulators Do?\nThe picture that I have painted here today leads me to a few general principles about the\nrole of supervision and regulation in the face of financial innovation.\nFirst, we must always remain mindful that reducing constraints and freeing up institutions\nto pursue new products and processes can have tremendous benefits. In part, these\nbenefits stem from removing constraints to innovation, and I’ve devoted some time today\nto the hypothesis that the fruits of financial innovation can be seen at the macroeconomic\nlevel in the form of reduced real volatility. But reducing regulatory constraints can also\nmore directly improve the allocation of credit and risk. Recent research has used the\nvarying times at which states deregulated their banking industries to find that state-level\nderegulation was associated with improvements in income-smoothing for people within\nthe state. 8\nSecond, to effectively carry out their role of monitoring risks in financial institutions, it is\nessential for regulators to keep pace with changes and advances in the marketplace. If\nsupervisors are to assess the adequacy of banks’ risk-management practices, they must\nhave a thorough understanding of emerging instruments and practices. This task is all the\nmore challenging if innovations originate outside of the regulated banking sector.\nThird, it is possible for regulation itself to be a driver of innovation. The advent of the\none-year, “364-day” credit facility was prompted by the 1988 Basel capital rules. This\nimposed a higher capital charge on credit lines with maturities of one year or more –\nhence, a facility lasting a day less than a year. Similarly, concentration limits on loan\nportfolios spurred the development of the secondary loan market, and the prohibition of\ninterest on corporate deposits spurred the development of “sweep accounts.” While it\nmay often be the case that innovations designed to “bypass” regulations ultimately lead to\nwider benefits for the market, this motivation generally makes innovation less likely to\nenhance efficiency.\nFinally, when innovation occurs outside of the banking industry, regulators’ main\nconcern should be with the interactions between the regulated and unregulated sectors.\nFor example, supervisors and institutions have focused heavily in recent years on\n8\n\nDemyanyk et al, J. Finance, forthcoming\n\n7\n\n\fstrengthening counterparty risk management practices and the settlement infrastructures\nundergirding important new financial markets. As I noted earlier, supervising this\nboundary requires that regulators broadly understand the activities of the unregulated\nsector, but perhaps even more important, it also requires regulators to understand how\ninnovations change the ways in which exposures can flow back into the banking sector.\nThese observations point to a regulatory approach that avoids being overly proscriptive,\nbut that attempts to ensure that regulated institutions’ practices for measuring and\nmanaging risks are appropriate for the changing environment. Regulators should avoid\nextending constraints motivated by safety-net considerations to entities that do not\nreceive safety-net support. And regulators should scrupulously avoid any actions or\npractices that would contribute to the perception that there is a probability of safety net\nsupport being extended into sectors that are now governed chiefly by market discipline.\nIn summary, I believe there is a strong case that financial innovation in the U.S. has\nbrought real, tangible benefits for macroeconomic performance and growth, and I am\ndrawn to the hypothesis that financial innovation can bring similar benefits to economies\nat different stages in the growth process. At the same time, some observers have\nexpressed concerns that this wave of innovation also has resulted in concentrations of risk\nthat add to financial market fragility. But at least as persuasive is the notion that the same\nadvances that have made it easier for market participants to evaluate and exchange\nvarious risks have also made it possible for markets to respond more resiliently to\ndisruptions by allowing market allocations to change more flexibly in response to\nchanging market circumstances. As a consequence, I believe regulators serve their\nmission best, not by second-guessing observed risk allocations, but by assuring that\nindividual institutions with access to a public sector safety net conduct their businesses\nusing risk measurement and management practices that keep pace with the ever-changing\nmarket.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\nAthreya, K., 2004. “Shame as it Ever Was: Stigma and Personal Bankruptcy,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly, 90 (Spring), 1-19.\nBernanke, B., 2004. “The Great Moderation,” speech to the Eastern Economic\nAssociation in Washington D.C., Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2004/20040220/default.htm\nDemyanyk, Y., C.

            "content": "Monetary Policy Tactics and Strategy\nGreater Baltimore Committee\nBaltimore, Maryland\nOctober 30, 2006\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\nThank you for that kind introduction, Don. It is a pleasure to be with this esteemed group\ntoday. This morning, I’d like to talk about monetary policy, but before I do, I need to\nnote that, as always, the views I express are my own, and do not necessarily coincide\nwith the views of my colleagues within the Federal Reserve. I’d like to talk about\nmonetary policy from two different perspectives: tactics and strategy. These obviously\nare two pertinent aspects of any sustained planning or decision-making endeavor,\nwhether it involves public policy or the private goals of businesses or households. By\ntactics, I mean the decisions we make and the actions we take on a day-to-day, month-tomonth, or, in the case of the Federal Open Market Committee, twice-a-quarter basis. Our\nmost visible tactical decision is our choice of the federal funds rate. You have probably\nnoticed that I have disagreed with many of my colleagues on this tactical choice at recent\nmeetings, and I will say a few words later on about why.\nTactics are in a sense reactive – for us, the choice of appropriate policy actions as\neconomic conditions unfold. Strategy, on the other hand, is the more forward-looking\npart of a decision-making problem: The process by which you establish specific goals\nand objectives, and think through the types of actions – that is, tactical choices – that are\nlikely to be required to move you toward your goal. A strategy doesn’t pin down all of\nyour actions in advance. Rather, a strategy guides your thinking about how to make\ntactical choices in response to incoming information in a way that is consistent with\nachievement of your long-run goals.\nTactics\nIn the first part of my remarks this morning, I would like to review the tactical situation\nfacing U.S. monetary policymakers. To set the stage, let me start with the broader\ncontext. The U.S. economy currently is in a period of transition. In the three years\nleading up to the second quarter, real gross domestic product – our broadest measure of\ntotal economic activity – grew at a 3.75 percent annual rate. That’s a very healthy growth\nrate to sustain over a number of years, and it significantly cut into the underutilization of\nlabor resources that emerged during the recession earlier in this decade. Over 5 million\nnew jobs were created over this period and the unemployment rate fell by a full 1.5\npercentage points. Labor market conditions are fairly firm now, and the economy is\ntransitioning to a period of growth at a rate consistent with job creation roughly matching\nthe growth in the number of workers over time. Although there is some uncertainty about\nexactly how fast that is, it is probably somewhere around 3 percent per year, and it would\nprobably involve creating roughly 100,000 jobs per month.\n\n\fIt would not be unusual for the transition to trend growth to be a little bumpy, however.\nThat occurred back in 1995, for example. Growth in the first half of that year dipped\nbelow 1 percent at an annual rate before returning to a healthy pace that was sustained for\nthe next five years. And this time around there is an obvious reason to expect growth to\ndrop below average for a time, namely, the end of the housing boom. I’ll offer a couple\nof observations about the boom itself before I talk about its aftermath.\nFirst, the recent housing boom was very large by historical standards; a couple of\nnumbers will help illustrate. In 2005 almost 2 million new homes were built in the U.S.,\nwhich is about 50 percent more than the average number built each year in the 1990s.\nAnd last year the average price of a home sold in the U.S. rose 13 percent; versus an\naverage increase of less than 3 percent per year back in the 1990s.\nSecond, it’s important to remember that the recent housing market boom was driven by\nfundamental factors that were – and still are – quite favorable. Population continues to\nexpand; for example, last year the number of households increased by one percent\nnationwide. Income is growing – so far this year, inflation-adjusted disposable income\nper person has increased at a 2.3 percent annual rate. Household net worth is 53 trillion\ndollars, which represents over five-and-a-half years of disposable personal income. The\ntax treatment of housing remains highly favorable. And finally, mortgage interest rates\nwere extremely low for many years, and even now are quite reasonable by historical\nstandards.\nThis multi-year surge in housing investment was bound to come to an end, as the demand\nfor upgrades and first homes became satiated. In addition, the rise in mortgage interest\nrates since 2004 has helped dampen demand. In fact, it seems likely that much of the\nincrease in interest rates was anticipated, and thus probably gave an extra boost to\ndemand in 2005 as consumers took advantage of what they saw then as the waning days\nof lower mortgage rates. A return to more normal housing market conditions is well\nunder way. New home sales are down about 20 percent from last year’s peak, and\nhousing starts have fallen by a similar magnitude. The rate of price appreciation has\nfallen substantially as well, to the point that average prices were lower in September than\nthey were a year earlier, although data on average sale prices are distorted by changes in\nthe composition of sales.\nSome further retrenchment seems likely in the months ahead, as housing market activity\nreturns to a more sustainable level in which volume, inventories and time-on-market are\ncloser to historical averages. This adjustment naturally involves a fair amount of\nuncertainty for market participants. Both buyers and sellers are probably more unsure\nthan usual right now about where prices need to settle in order to clear markets. In the\nmeantime, they are collectively engaged in a time-consuming process of discovering the\nprices at which expectations and plans of buyers and sellers are mutually consistent. But\nwhile there is substantial uncertainty about where the bottoming out will occur, I don’t\nthink a catastrophic collapse in housing activity is likely, since the fundamental\ndeterminants of housing demand that I listed earlier remain favorable – prospects for\npopulation and real income growth look good, net worth remains high, and after-tax\n\n2\n\n\fmortgage interest rates are still historically low. In fact, tentative signs are emerging that\nhousing markets may be stabilizing, although because housing data are notoriously\nchoppy, one should treat month-to-month numbers with more than the usual amount of\ncare right now.\nOutside of housing, the rest of the economy is in reasonably good health. Business\ncapital spending, for example, has been quite a bright spot in recent years. Since early\n2003, business fixed investment has grown at over a 6.5 percent annual rate, and since the\nbeginning of this year has grown at an 8.8 percent rate. This more than offset the 10\npercent contraction in residential investment over the same time period. The fundamental\nunderpinnings of near-term investment demand are encouraging as well. Profitability is\nhigh, capacity utilization has been steadily rising, and many firms see strong demand for\ntheir products. So I expect capital spending to continue to be a source of strength over\nthe next several quarters.\nMany economic analysts are concerned about the potential fallout of a weakening\nhousing market on consumer spending. Could falling housing prices cause consumers to\nrein in spending? It’s important to begin with fundamentals. While fluctuations in\nhousehold wealth are capable of affecting spending at the margin, consumers’ spending\nbehavior is predominantly determined by their current and future income prospects. And\nthose prospects are looking pretty good right now. With the unemployment rate at 4.6\npercent, the labor market is looking fairly tight. Despite large increases in gasoline prices\nearlier this year, inflation-adjusted incomes have been rising, as I noted earlier. And now\nthat we’ve seen some relief at the gas pump, it would not be surprising to see a modest\npickup in real income growth in the next couple of months. The deceleration and fall in\nhousing prices certainly has cut into household net worth to some extent, and consumer\nspending did decelerate at the beginning of this year. But so far, such wealth effects have\nbeen relatively limited – consumer spending rose a healthy 3.1 percent in the third\nquarter.\nTaking all these considerations into account, I would look for consumer spending to\ncontinue to expand at a reasonably good pace even if housing prices come in weaker than\nexpected.\nThe labor market is another widely-cited arena for potentially adverse spillover effects\nfrom the housing market. We have seen employment in the residential construction\nsector fall this year as residential building activity has declined. Fortunately, however,\nnonresidential construction is on an upswing – over the four quarters ending in\nSeptember, investment in nonresidential structures rose over 13 percent in real terms.\nThis has allowed many home construction workers to simply change construction jobs\nrather than become unemployed. Indeed, although in September residential construction\nemployment had fallen by 54,000 since peaking in February, nonresidential construction\nemployment was up by 95,000.\nSo the outlook for overall spending looks reasonably good: consumer spending is on\ntrack, and business investment is robust. The downturn in housing activity has and will\n\n3\n\n\fsubtract from headline GDP growth, but it is not likely to cancel out these sources of\nstrength.\nIn contrast, the outlook for inflation is discomforting. Over the last two years, there have\nbeen several episodes in which energy prices have surged and pushed up the overall\ninflation rate. More troubling is the fact that we have seen significant increases in “core\ninflation” – the measure of inflation that strips out food and energy prices. According to\nour preferred index, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, core inflation\nran close to 3 percent this past spring.\nWhile core PCE inflation has settled down to around 2.25 percent, that is a rate that\nwould be unacceptable on a sustained basis. Here is where tactics have to be driven by\nstrategy. The Federal Reserve’s strategic goal, as a central bank, is price stability. We\nare the only institution that can achieve this, and attaining and maintaining price stability\nis the best contribution we can make to maximizing economic growth.\nI and several other members of the FOMC have expressed the view that our price\nstability objective is equivalent to a core PCE inflation rate in a band between 1 and 2\npercent, that is, a band centered around 1.5 percent. You might think that price stability\nshould mean inflation equal to zero, that is, prices not changing over time, on average,\nbut there are known upward biases in our available price indexes, and targeting a band\nabove zero is a way of taking those biases into account.\nCore inflation has been above this 1 to 2 percent band for over two years now, since April\n2004, and is running at 2.5 percent so far this year. The longer inflation remains\nelevated, the more difficult it will be to bring it back down. As people observe actual\ncore inflation between 2.25 and 2.5 percent, and as they observe the FOMC’s tactical\nreactions to those numbers, they form expectations regarding future inflation and those\nexpectations become the basis for price setting in product and labor markets. (By the\nway, it was for his contributions to economic research on exactly this phenomenon that\nProfessor Edmund Phelps was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics several weeks ago.\nSome of his cited work emphasized the extent to which the public’s expectations will\nshift over time as they observe policymakers actual tactical choices.) The strategic issue\nhere is that if the Fed allows inflation to remain above target for too long, inflation\nexpectations could become tightly centered around the higher rate.\nThis danger is what prompted me to vote at recent FOMC meetings for tactics aimed at\nbringing inflation down more rapidly, and in a way that convinces the public of our\nstrategic intent to keep inflation low and stable. Against this risk, one must weigh the\nrisk that a further increase in the federal funds rate might exacerbate the housing-related\nslowdown. My assessment at recent meetings has been that the economy is resilient\nenough right now to withstand further policy tightening.\n\n4\n\n\fStrategy\nThere is another way for the public to learn about our intent, however, beyond simply\nobserving our tactical choices. We can try to communicate more directly with the public\nabout our monetary policy strategy. Households, businesses and financial market\nparticipants form their expectations about future inflation from several sources: past\ninflation experience, their understanding of the economic outlook, their observation of\nthe Fed’s monetary policy actions, and their beliefs about the Fed’s inflation strategy. A\nkey component of monetary policy strategy is our long-term goal for inflation – what the\nFed would like to see as an average rate of inflation over long periods of time. While it is\ndifficult to perfectly control inflation quarter to quarter, the Fed can pin down long-run\naverage inflation very well.\nInflation targeting has been adopted by many other central banks: the European Central\nBank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Sweden and New Zealand, for\nexample. There are many aspects of inflation targeting as it has been implemented\nabroad – inflation reports, consultations with Finance Ministers, supporting legislation,\nand so on. But the core feature of inflation targeting everywhere is communicating an\nexplicit numerical inflation objective. So I think it makes sense to talk about inflation\ntargets in the context of the broader subject of “communications” – how we as a central\nbank communicate about monetary policy.\nI’d like to start by suggesting that we should not think of “conducting monetary policy”\nand “communicating about monetary policy” as two different things. It is certainly\ntempting to think of setting a target for a short-term interest rate and issuing policy\nstatements as two separate acts that raise two separate sets of considerations. But modern\nmonetary economics and common sense both tell us that the two are inseparable. People\nwill always try to figure out what the central bank is going to do with its policy\ninstrument in the future, no matter how much or how little the central bank actually says\nabout these things. If the central bank says nothing, it still implicitly communicates via\nits actions, because people will always try to infer the central bank’s future conduct from\ntheir current and past actions. In fact, modern monetary economics teaches that there is a\nvery real sense in which “monetary policy is all about communication.”\nThe logic behind this statement is not complex or arcane. First, money is intrinsically\nuseless; it has value only for what it can purchase in the future. People accept money in\nexchange for valuable resources only because they expect others to accept it in exchange\nin the future. Therefore, the current value of money depends on the value people expect\nmoney to have in the future. So expected future inflation can give rise to inflation\npressures today.\nA corollary to this principle is that controlling current inflation requires controlling\npeople’s expectations for future inflation. This is the sense in which monetary policy is\nall about communications, because anything we do to shape people’s perceptions and\nexpectations amounts to communications, whether we’re communicating by words or by\n\n5\n\n\fdeeds. The central implication here is the importance of managing and stabilizing the\npublic’s inflation expectations.\nThe history of the 1970s provides a vivid illustration. The Federal Reserve allowed\ninflation to rise during economic expansions and following oil price shocks.\nExpectations regarding future inflation subsequently rose as well, as the public observed\nour tolerance for rising inflation. This provided a further impetus to inflation, as those\nexpectations influenced wage bargains, and price-setting by firms. A large part of the\nbattle to reduce inflation in the 1980s and ’90s was a battle to dampen the “inflation\npsychology” that had taken hold, that is, a battle to convince the public that we would\nachieve and maintain price stability. Over the course of those decades, we and other\ncentral bankers around the world learned another important lesson relating to\ncommunications: Namely, that words and subsequent deeds must ultimately be\nconsistent.\nThe economic term for this principle is “time consistency,” which simply means that your\ntactical choices have to be consistent with people’s expectations of those choices over\ntime. (By the way, the 2004 Nobel Prize in economics honored Professors Finn Kydland\nand Ed Prescott for their pioneering work applying exactly this principle to, among other\nthings, monetary policy.) The more common term for this principle is “credibility,” and a\npopular slang expression is “walking the talk.” The 1970s again provide a vivid\nillustration: All throughout the 1970s, the Fed said it was against inflation, but our\nactions spoke differently and people came to believe our actions rather than our words.\nIn the early 1980s, the battle to reduce inflation required costly policy actions to convince\npeople of our intentions. It took time and effort to establish our credibility.\nWhat does this mean for inflation targeting? If we adopt an inflation target, we will have\nto be sure that we back up our commitment with appropriate monetary policy actions.\nOtherwise, our target would just be viewed as “cheap talk.” One way to appreciate the\npotential value of an explicit inflation target is to consider how it might have helped us\ncope with inflation dynamics over the last few years. On several occasions, usually in\nresponse to energy price shocks, questions have arisen about where inflation was headed,\nthat is, about what inflation rate we were willing to tolerate. After Hurricane Katrina, for\nexample, when retail gasoline prices rose above $3 a gallon, there was widespread\nspeculation that the Fed would pause in order to protect growth rather than protect price\nstability. Measures of inflation expectations rose noticeably as a result. That speculation\nwas off-base, though. Forceful public statements by Committee members tamped down\nthose expectations, but core inflation did bump up for a time as firms were able to pass on\nenergy price increases to buyers who may have been anticipating a broader upswing in\ninflation.\nA similar episode occurred this past spring in response to another round of energy price\nincreases. Inflation expectations rose, and were subsequently tamped down by\nCommittee member communications, but not before another bulge in core inflation\nemerged, a bulge that has now only partly subsided. I take both these episodes as miniinflation-scares. In both cases, and others as well in recent years, I believe some financial\n\n6\n\n\fmarket volatility can fairly be attributed to public uncertainty about our intentions for\ninflation.\nIf we had had a credible inflation target in place, I believe that market reactions most\nlikely would have been different. People would have known that we intended to return\ncore inflation to our target. Maintaining the credibility of a target, however, would\nimpose constraints on our tactical choices. If core inflation drifts substantially above\ntarget, I believe that the Committee would feel compelled to explain how long it was\nlikely to take for inflation to return to target and to comment on the policy actions that\nwould likely be required to get there. Moreover, if we see evidence that markets do not\nview our target as credible, we may feel compelled to take further policy actions to\nenhance our credibility.\nThere are differences of opinion among economists about short-run inflation dynamics,\nand about how fast the central bank should seek to return inflation to target. But there is\nvirtual unanimity that the central bank can bring about any average inflation it likes over\nthe horizon of a decade or more. Moreover, it is important to recognize that this is not\nthe case with regard to real economic quantities such as output growth or the\nunemployment rate. The central bank can influence the path of output and employment\nover short horizons, but in the long-run, real economic variables are determined by the\nfundamental forces of productivity growth, population growth, labor force participation\ndecisions, savings behavior, and the like. There is virtual unanimity that these are\nultimately beyond the control of the central bank, and so to set an explicit objective for\ngrowth or employment would be a mistake.\nI have talked about monetary policy tactics and strategy, and have touched on the\ninterplay between the two. Tactical policy decisions should be guided by strategic\nobjectives; this is an obvious and widely applicable principle. But in the case of\nmonetary policy, the public’s expectations regarding future tactical decisions play a\ncrucial role in determining current outcomes, because inflation expectations play such a\ncrucial role in determining current inflation. Without having credibly and explicitly\ncommunicated our strategic goals, tactical decision-making is more challenging than it\nneeds to be. Policymakers are in that case forced to resort to policy actions – that is,\nfunds rate changes – to influence the public’s expectations. Accordingly, one factor\ncontributing to my voting decisions at the last few FOMC meetings was a sense that\ninflation expectations were somewhat higher than would be consistent with my definition\nof price stability. As communications tools go, however, funds rate changes are\nrelatively blunt. I believe, therefore, and I hope to have convinced you, that an explicit\nnumerical objective for inflation would improve the effectiveness of both the strategy and\ntactics of monetary policy.\n\n7\n\n\f",

            "content": "The Evolution of Consumer Finance\nConference of State Bank Supervisors\nNorfolk, Virginia\nMay 18, 2006\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nAt the outset this morning I would like to congratulate you: 2005 marked the first year in\nthe history of the federal deposit insurance program in which there were no failures of\nFDIC-insured institutions. While the banking industry clearly has benefited from a\nrelatively healthy macroeconomic environment, I think the lack of bank failures last year\nis strong evidence that supervisory agencies — both state and federal — have been doing\nan outstanding job. In fact, one could argue that we have done too good a job, since, as\nour recently retired Fed Chairman was fond of observing, the optimal number of bank\nfailures is certainly not zero, the point being that risk-taking is an essential part of\nbanking, and even if our banking system as a general matter is taking only prudent, wellmanaged risks, there may still be some failures from time to time. Furthermore, risk is an\ninherent part of innovation, and when banks are trying new things, some will succeed and\nsome will not. But innovation is vital to the continued growth and progress of the\nindustry and its ability to provide the public with ever more useful and efficient financial\nservices over time. I would like to note, as usual, that the views expressed are my own\nand are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe theme of innovation and its relationship to risk permeates contemporary banking and\nfinance. We certainly see it in the growing use of interest rate and credit derivatives for\nrisk management. While such tools can assist organizations in limiting their exposures to\nrisk, they can also, if used imprudently, be a source of increased risk. Although the term\n“financial innovation” typically conjures up images of what we might call “high finance,”\ninnovation has also been arguably the most important driver for the evolution of the\nmarket for consumer credit, the subject of my talk to you this morning. Because much of\nthe transformation of consumer credit markets in recent decades amounts to the\ndevelopment of new and more varied loan products for a growing set of consumers with\nmore variable pricing.\nMany recent innovations in consumer credit products have garnered a fair amount of\nattention both in the popular press and in supervisory and legislative arenas. Rather than\naddress any of the specifics surrounding these issues, I would like take two steps back\nand look at these innovations from a broader perspective. Over the last two decades, we\nhave witnessed what can arguably be called a revolution in retail consumer finance.\nPerhaps the hallmark of this revolution has been the dramatic expansion of unsecured\nlending through the proliferation of credit cards. This growth has not been limited to\nunsecured credit, but also includes innovative mortgage and home equity lending.\nThe wave of innovation that has driven these trends has brought widespread change to the\nfinancial services industry. While this expansion of credit has been broadly beneficial to a\nwide array of consumers, it has also brought with it a growth in the number and\n\n\ffrequency of consumer defaults and bankruptcies, a trend that has contributed to a\ngrowing concern in some quarters that American households have “lost control” of their\nfinances to a dizzying array of new products and options and that lenders are taking on\nnew risks for which they may not be adequately prepared.\nMy main purpose today is to discuss the nature of innovation in lending, particularly at\nthe retail end. As regulators, it is important for us to understand that innovation is an\ninherently risky activity, whether we are talking about a large, sophisticated institution\nthat “invents” new products or processes, or a smaller community bank that innovates by\nputting new products or processes to use. As supervisors, it is important for us to\nunderstand that innovation in financial products is likely to be a feature of the banking\nlandscape for many years to come. Supervisory practice and philosophy should view\nfinancial innovation as a relatively permanent feature of the banking industry, rather than\ntreat each burst of innovation as an episodic, one-off occurrence. Thus, as a general\nprinciple, supervisors place a great deal of emphasis on the ability of bankers to measure,\nmonitor and manage their risk profiles over time and make informed risk acceptance\ndecisions, since risk is intrinsic to the banking business. Supervisory guidance regarding\ninnovative consumer finance products should recognize their potential benefits to a wide\narray of households in addition to their risk management implications.\n***\nThe expansion of consumer credit in the U. S. over the last decade and a half has been\ntruly astonishing. This expansion occurred across a number of product lines. Probably\nmost prominent has been the expansion of credit card lending. Home mortgage lending,\nincluding home equity credit, has also seen robust growth. Much new mortgage lending\nrecently has taken the form of so-called “non-traditional mortgages,” such as “interestonly” mortgages that allow the borrower to defer principal payments for the first few\nyears, or “option ARMs” that provide the borrower with several flexible payment\noptions.\nAn especially prominent feature of the secular expansion of consumer credit has been the\ngrowth in lending to lower-income consumers, many of whom had in the past been\nunable to obtain credit on as favorable terms from the financial sector. Indeed, many had\nbeen unable to obtain credit except from fringe lenders such as pawnbrokers, payday\nlenders, or through informal arrangements with friends and family. Some borrowers that\ntake out non-traditional mortgages would not have qualified for traditional mortgage\nproducts otherwise, or would not have qualified for loans as large. The growth in retail\ncredit, thus, has brought expanded social benefits to a wide array of consumers.\nI would argue that this broad expansion of consumer credit has been driven by advances\nin information and communication technologies, which have reduced the cost of\nobtaining, evaluating and monitoring consumer account information. At a basic level, this\ndramatically increased the productivity of the back-office functions associated with all\nphases of the banking business. Payments processing and the associated book-keeping\ntasks became much cheaper. The result was a general decline in the intermediation costs\nthat lenders ultimately must recover on top of their funding costs. Competition forced\n2\n\n\flenders to pass on these cost savings to borrowers in the form of lower lending rates.\nMore consumers could afford to borrow, and the market expanded.\nThe application of information technology to the lending process itself has been evident\nin a number of ways, from the automation of underwriting to the use of credit scoring.\nLenders have been able to access and utilize an expanded array of information about\npotential borrowers. These advances did not change the fundamental nature of\nunderwriting, however; they just made it more effective. Underwriting is about making\ndistinctions between people in order to decide whether to lend, and if so, how much to\ncharge. When lenders were limited to reviewing paper loan applications and oldfashioned credit reports, they could sort potential borrowers into only a few broad\ncategories. New technologies allowed lenders to bring more and more consumer-specific\ninformation to bear on lending and pricing decisions, and thus make finer distinctions\nbetween consumers. The result was that the lending decision and loan terms could be\nmore closely tailored to individual borrowers. Lenders were able to offer lower interest\nrates to less-risky customers, and were able to pluck out the creditworthy from among the\ngroup of customers that formerly were unable to qualify for credit at all.\nBeyond the direct impact of new technologies on underwriting, innovations also\ncontributed to the spread of loan securitization, by making it easier for investors to assess\nthe risk characteristics of the underlying loans. Securitization separates loan origination\nfrom holding loans on a balance sheet, thereby allowing originating institutions to\neconomize on funding and capital costs. And the development of quantitative methods\nfor the pricing of options — combining the massive computing power that came online in\nthe late 1980s with the models that finance theorists pioneered in the mid-1970s —\nopened the door for banks and other financial intermediaries to properly price the put\nfeature inherent in a long-term mortgage, and the option value of loan commitments such\nas home equity lines of credit and credit cards.\nThe technology-driven expansion of retail credit is evident in the growth of household\ndebt and in the proliferation of entirely new credit products. For example, many nontraditional mortgage products, particularly those offered to less-creditworthy borrowers,\nwould not have been economically feasible without the new, more advanced pricing\nmodels and underwriting techniques. Likewise, home equity lines of credit became more\nwidely available in part because of the lower cost of accurately assessing\ncreditworthiness.\nThese developments have also had important consequences for the structure of retail\nlending markets and for the activities of community banks. Much of the innovation I have\nbeen describing involves realizing economies from standardization and from the\napplication of technologies with substantial economies of scale. One implication has been\nthe increased concentration of some consumer lending activity at relatively large lenders.\nThis appears to be particularly true in the case of credit cards. On the other hand, the\nspread of securitization, especially in home lending, allows smaller institutions to remain\nin the market as originators of credits that then get securitized. On the whole, however,\ntechnological advances in lending based on quantitative underwriting seem to have\nfavored larger institutions. Consequently, these changes have tended to move community\nbanks toward lending based on less quantitative and more judgmental underwriting\n3\n\n\ftechniques where they appear to have a comparative advantage — exploiting the fact that\nquantitative measures of creditworthiness will always be to some extent incomplete, and\nthat other information available to local lenders can be difficult to commoditize. Thus,\nloans where it’s hard to quantify risk assessment, as in “character lending” and\ncommercial real estate, have become increasingly important to community banks.\nThis is also a recurring theme — the idea that technological advances in banking enhance\neconomies of scale and therefore result in more concentrated market shares. I think that\nit’s possible to make too much of this idea, since it is often possible for the benefits of\nscale to be brought to mid-sized and even smaller institutions through the provision of\nservices by third parties. Still, the consequences of innovation for the structure of the\nindustry are important to bear in mind, and the fact that banks of different sizes might\nimplement technology in different ways — some doing it in-house and some acquiring it\nfrom third parties — creates another dimension of change — organizational change — of\nwhich supervisors must be aware.\nThe usual presumption regarding innovations that successfully penetrate markets — from\nhigh-speed Internet to high-definition TV — is that they are broadly beneficial to\nconsumers, and I believe this to be true of retail financial market innovations as well. The\nexpansion of retail credit has allowed consumers greater flexibility in managing their\nhousehold finances, responding to fluctuations in household financial conditions, and\naccumulating durable goods. At the same time, the expansion of retail credit has brought\nan increase in what one might call “bad outcomes” — households that face high debt\nburdens, have trouble meeting payment commitments, and perhaps even default and\nresort to bankruptcy. The popular media regularly recount horror stories of unsuspecting\nconsumers who find themselves in dire straits following an encounter with the retail\ncredit industry. Consumer advocates have publicized accounts of abusive practices by\nunscrupulous lenders and have charged regulators with lax enforcement of existing\nconsumer protections. It appears that a significant constituency now favors tighter\nlegislative and regulatory constraints on retail credit providers of all types, from banks to\npayday lenders. And new credit market products and practices have given rise to\nsupervisory concerns about the associated risks.\nThe rising incidence of credit problems and the resulting sentiment for new or tighter\nregulation are natural byproducts, I would argue, of the wave of innovation in financial\nproducts and services. A credit expansion naturally brings with it an increase in the\nincidence of “bad outcomes.” As credit becomes available to a broader array of\nborrowers, there is an inevitable increase in the number and even the rate of\ndelinquencies, defaults and bankruptcies. Moreover, the new borrowers being drawn in to\ncredit markets are likely to be, on average, less financially savvy and more vulnerable to\nthe unscrupulous as they struggle to learn about unfamiliar credit products. The popular\nfocus on cases of fraud and financial distress often drives the politics of consumer\nfinance. The very nature of innovation in consumer credit markets thus gives rise to\ncompelling stories that are powerful motivators for attempts to regulate or restrain new\npractices.\nProposed restraints on retail lending often are intended to protect consumers from their\nown poor judgment, which makes them vulnerable to abusive lending practices. In fact,\n4\n\n\fin many historical episodes of expanding credit, the desire to regulate has been\naccompanied by a popular belief that growing debt is a sign of decaying values and thrift.\nOne historian has referred to this persistent belief as the “myth of lost economic virtue.”\nBelief in this myth can easily hide from view the positive economic role of credit in\nhousehold financial management and the benefits that come from expanded access to\ncredit.\nIncreases in the number or frequency of bad credit outcomes could also expose some\nbanks to increased losses. Of course part of the reason for a credit expansion is\nimprovements in the ability of lenders to measure, price for, monitor and absorb such\nlosses, so the mere increase in losses after the fact should not, in itself, be cause for\nconcern, especially if they are expected losses that are priced and reserved for. As long as\na lender’s entry into a new product line is appropriately managed, increased loss rates are\nin a sense a measure of the extent to which access to credit has been provided to new\nborrowers. But just as new financial products expose inexperienced borrowers to the\npossibility of mistaken credit market choices, so too may lenders bring different levels of\nexperience to the adoption of new financial products. These banks, like the new\nconsumer borrowers, will inevitably have varied experiences in their new ventures —\nsome will be more successful than others. But the learning that comes along with the trial\nand error inherent in these diverse experiences is a vital part of the innovation process.\nBecause innovation and progress don’t just come from people inventing new products;\nthey also come from people learning how to manage new processes.\nThis last observation may have implications for how regulators think about banks’\nventures into new activities — whether in consumer finance or any other line of business.\nExaminers are naturally going to pay close attention to the risks associated with new\nactivities, as well they should. But we also have to recognize the value of the learning\nthat is inherent in the process of financial innovation, as in any other innovative\nendeavor. As always, we need to be mindful of benefits as well as risks when evaluating\nbanks’ activities, and be careful not to stifle worthwhile financial innovations. Seeking\nsuch a balance suggests that robust risk practices should include sound processes for\napproving new product offerings.\nPerhaps a more important implication of retail credit expansion for banks and their\nsupervisors stems from the fact that standardization and automation have moved much of\nthis lending — or the credit exposure, in the case of home loan securitization — off the\nbooks of community bank organizations either to large banks or to securities markets in\nthe case of home loan securitization. I mentioned earlier that this seems to have driven\nmany community banks toward lending based on softer, less quantitative risk assessment\n— commercial real estate, for example. Could this broad movement have made\ncommunity bank lending inherently riskier, or harder to monitor and assess? If so, we\nwould have reason to ensure that the banks moving in this direction understand and are\nprepared to manage the risks they take on. The proposed guidance on commercial real\nestate lending issued by the federal financial agencies this past January seeks to do just\nthat. As always, however, regulators need to be mindful of the extent to which observed\ntrends in bank lending may be driven by productive innovation rather than risk\nmanagement myopia.\n5\n\n\fMuch of the popular response to consumer credit expansion and its byproducts has been\nless about prudential supervision, however, and more about consumer protection. Many\nproposals amount to calls for lending restrictions or the outright prohibition of some\nlending practices. This strikes me as a dangerous approach. In the long run, it would tend\nto slow innovation and constrain the availability of financial products to a broad range of\nconsumers in order to protect the relatively few who use a credit product inappropriately\nor unadvisedly. It would be analogous to limiting homeowners insurance on the grounds\nthat many homeowners never file claims in excess of their premium payments and thus\nend up regretting their purchase of insurance.\nSince the rise in undesirable borrowing outcomes is related to the increased participation\nof inexperienced and uninformed borrowers as the credit market expands, a more\npromising approach would seem to be to improve the knowledge and expertise of\nborrowers. One method to address this problem is through careful and more thoughtful\ndesign of lender disclosures. The supervisory community ought to encourage disclosure\nstatements written for real consumers, rather than lawyers, as now seems to be the case.\nMore broadly, moving from strict rules-based consumer protection regulations towards\nmore principles-based disclosure expectations might allow for more effective customer\ncommunications in the face of complex and ever-changing products.\nMore broadly, everyone in the financial services industry should understand their interest\nin enhancing consumers’ financial literacy. We train our young people in how to use\nautomobiles, after all, a product whose early market penetration drew in less savvy users.\nIn my opinion, we could do a better of job of training people in how to use financial\nproducts.\nOn a supervisory level, we would not want our response to the spread of new lending\nproducts to squelch innovations that are useful to consumers. So while we need to ensure\nthat banks understand sufficiently well the risk characteristics of new lending products\nthey deploy and that banks at the forefront of innovation have particularly robust risk\nmanagement practices, any guidance we provide on such products should recognize that\ninnovations that meet a market test are generally beneficial, and that the learning\ngenerated by early experience with new products often results in significant product\nimprovements over time. Balancing these considerations is the challenge.\n\nJohn Weinberg and Jennifer Zara provided valuable assistance in preparing this speech.\n\n6\n\n\f",

            "content": "The Economic Outlook\nEconomic Roundtable of the Ohio Valley\nParkersburg, West Virginia\nApril 4, 2006\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nIt is a pleasure to speak on the economic outlook this morning, in part due to this\ndistinguished Ohio Valley audience, and in part because the outlook is so encouraging.\nGrowth is proceeding on a solid pace this year, and inflation is low and stable. Moreover,\nour economy has withstood several substantial shocks over the last several years, and yet\nhas remained on course. So, I think we have abundant reason to be grateful for a quite\npositive economic outlook. Before I begin reviewing that outlook, however, I would like\nto note, as usual, that the views expressed are my own and are not necessarily those of\nmy colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nIt has now become uncontroversial to say that the outlook for overall economic activity is\nquite healthy. But six months ago, you may recall that many pundits were decidedly less\noptimistic. In the wake of the destruction caused by two hurricanes, energy prices had\nsurged. From the end of 2004 to the peak last fall, crude oil prices rose 56 percent,\nwholesale natural gas prices rose 129 percent, and retail gasoline prices rose 70 percent.\nTo some, it seemed obvious that the high energy prices would lead to a significant and\npersistent reduction in consumer spending, which would bring overall economic activity\nto the edge of recession. That didn’t happen. It is true that the growth rate of real GDP\nin the fourth quarter fell by about 2 percentage points from its trend over the previous two\nyears, but a closer look reveals that transitory factors played a large role there. Other data\nhave remained robust, and the consensus forecast is now that real growth in the first half\nof this year will be at about a 4 percent rate.\nLet’s take a closer look at some of the recent data that support this healthy outlook.\nStarting with the national labor market, payroll employment has grown rapidly, adding\nalmost a million new jobs in the last four months, through February. This is more than\ndouble the rate that would simply keep pace with population growth. As you might\nexpect, this has driven the overall unemployment rate down under 5 percent. Another\nindicator of a strong demand for labor is wage growth, which has been steadily increasing\nlately. Over the same four months, average hourly earnings have risen at a 3.5 percent\nannual rate, markedly above the 3 percent growth we had seen in the previous 12 months.\nThe combination of rising employment and rising wage gains has supported substantial\nincome growth – over the last four months for which we have data, real personal income\nhas risen at a healthy 5.4 percent annual rate. And that, in turn, helps explain the\nresilience of consumer spending. The conventional view of economists has long been that\nconsumer spending is governed predominantly by a household’s assessment of their own\n\n\ffuture real income streams. Thus, despite rising energy prices and surveys last fall that\nsuggested sagging consumer confidence, inflation-adjusted consumer spending increased\nat a booming 8.0 percent annual rate over the holiday season, and now runs at about 3.2\npercent ahead of a year ago.\nLooking ahead, to assess the outlook for consumers’ spending, you begin with their\nincome prospects. Expectations are that the overall labor market will continue to be\nstrong: continued job growth, a moderate unemployment rate, and further real wage gains\nshould lead to healthy advances in incomes and, thus, overall consumer spending.\nBefore turning away from households, I’d like to touch on residential housing activity.\nAs I’m sure you know, the housing market has had an amazing run in recent years. To\ncite one measure, new housing starts rose from 1.57 million units in 2000 to 2.07 million\nunits in 2005, a remarkable 5.7 percent average annual rate of increase. And that’s just\nthe number of housing units; on top of that, the size and quality of the average new home\nhas been steadily increasing. Another indicator of strong demand was rising prices for\nexisting homes. For the nation as a whole, the price of a typical single-family home rose\n55 percent over the same time period.\nYou won’t hear me use the B-word to describe this remarkable activity. Instead, I\nbelieve fundamental factors can fully explain the expansion we’ve seen in the demand for\nhousing, particularly rising incomes, rising population, favorable tax treatment, and very\nlow interest rates. At the present time, mortgage interest rates are not as favorable as they\nwere a few years ago, and so it is not surprising that we are seeing some signs of a\ntapering off of residential activity in many markets. For example, there were 1.28 million\nnew single-family home sales last year, but so far this year the sales rate has averaged\n1.14 million. I see this not as a precipitous decline, but rather as a return to more normal\nconditions in many markets. This return to normalcy is especially pronounced in the\ninformal evidence we receive. The multiple first-day bids and final sales at above-asking\nprices that were observed in many markets have become increasingly rare. Also, the\namount of time that a home remains on the market has risen back up to more typical\nlevels. Looking ahead, it seems reasonable to expect the housing market to remain\nstrong, even as some further tapering off in sales and production takes place.\nThe key point I would like to emphasize is that the housing phenomenon was not a\nmysterious, independent boost to the economy, driven by some sort of animal spirits, but\ninstead was a rational response by households to the economic fundamentals, especially\nvery low real interest rates. Thus, going forward, the adjustment of the housing market to\nevolving fundamentals will continue to fit comfortably within the standard economic\nframework. My assessment is that plausible rates of moderation in housing activity will\nnot pose a problem for overall activity this year or next. Moreover, I don’t see\ndiminished housing price appreciation as a major problem for consumer spending, since\nagain, the primary determinant of spending is income, and we see solid and improving\nprospects for real incomes for the nation as a whole.\n\n2\n\n\fTurning to firms, the fundamentals for business investment appear to be quite sound.\nCapital formation, particularly investment in information and communications\ntechnology, played an instrumental role in the widely noted surge in productivity growth\nthat took place in the late 1990s. The unique fundamental driving force then was the\nrapid and sustained fall in the relative price of new computing equipment and associated\nproducts. This investment boom resulted in a growing capital stock, and as a result rising\nproductivity growth. Indeed, productivity growth had only averaged 1.38 percent per\nyear for over two decades, but from 1995 to 2000 averaged 2.52 percent per year. That\nmay sound like a small difference, but remember that over time, productivity growth is\nthe foundation of rising standards of living, and that compounding over many years can\ntransform small differences in growth rates into substantial differences in incomes. Thus\nif productivity growth remained at 1.38 percent, it would take around 50 years for\naverage incomes to double. But with productivity growth at 2.52 percent, the doubling\ntime is cut to almost 28 years.\nLooking at more recent numbers, productivity growth since 2000 has averaged 3.3\npercent per year, which incidentally would double average incomes in less than 21 years.\nThis is an astonishing performance over a time period with significantly lower rates of\ncapital formation than in the late 1990s. Thus, recent productivity gains appear to owe\nsomewhat more to the re-organization of business processes than to the application of\nadditional capital. But as business investment continues to grow, productivity growth is\nlikely to be driven more by capital formation. We should therefore pay special attention\nto current prospects for investment spending.\nIn my view, the fundamentals for investment are encouraging. In the high-tech area, we\nare still seeing declining relative prices for many products. Business sales are strong.\nNew orders for capital equipment have been on a pronounced uptrend for 2 ½ years. The\ncost of capital remains favorable. Capacity utilization in manufacturing has recovered\nfrom the recession and any capital overhang is largely behind us. And business\nprofitability is unusually high. Putting these all together, I expect investment spending to\nbe quite robust this year. Falling relative prices should continue to support technology\nupgrades that enhance efficiency for many firms. In addition, rising capacity utilization\nrates suggest that many firms will need to add capacity to keep up with demand growth.\nAnd if I am correct, this capital spending should be enough to support overall demand in\nthe economy, even as the housing market cools down.\nThis is a good time to review the bidding. It looks like we’re on track for continued\nexpansion, with real GDP growing at about a 3 ½ percent annual rate this year.\nConsumer spending should grow in line with GDP and will be supported by job growth\nand real wage gains. Residential investment will flatten or slow, but business capital\nspending should remain robust. And that capital spending will support productivity\ngrowth going forward, which in turn will support the future income growth that keeps\nhousehold spending healthy. And while there are risks to this forecast, as there are with\nany forecast, I do not see any single scenario that is compelling enough to alter the\ncentral tendency of this outlook.\n\n3\n\n\fLet’s turn now to the inflation picture, where again things are looking better now than\nmany had expected six months ago. Back then, the energy price surge had led some\nobservers to expect to see those prices pass through to a broad range of prices of goods\nand services, much like what happened in the 1970s. But that hasn’t happened. Core\ninflation has been low and relatively steady in the last several years. Our preferred\ninflation measure, the price index for core personal consumption expenditures, has risen\n1.8 percent over the last 12 months. Despite rising energy prices, core inflation actually\nfell slightly last year, since the core price index had risen 2.2 percent in 2004. Similarly,\nwe are not seeing any sign of rising inflation in the most recent data. Over the last two\nmonths, for example, the core index has increased at a 1.8 percent annual rate as well. To\nput that number in perspective, it lies close to the 1 ½ percent figure that I and several\nothers have proposed as an announced numerical objective for inflation.\nWhy haven’t high energy prices boosted other prices as much as many had feared?\nProbably because those fears are based on looking back at the 1970s and seeing that\nsimilar energy price increases had been followed by broader increases in overall inflation.\nI would argue that any analogy with the 1970s is badly flawed. Back then, monetary\npolicy failed to respond effectively to rising inflationary pressures and the public’s\nexpectations of future inflation had consequently become unanchored. Thus, at that time,\nhigher energy prices became a signal for firms to raise prices and for workers to demand\nhigher wages in order not to fall behind a prospective inflationary surge.\nToday, however, the Fed places its highest priority on keeping inflation low, and our\nability and willingness to follow through on our announced intentions appears to be\nwidely understood. Thus, longer-term expectations of inflation have remained moderate\neven as energy prices have moved up over the last couple of years. Looking ahead, shortterm movements in the inflation rate can be hard to predict. But what is important is to\nstabilize inflation over medium- and longer-term horizons. And here the indicators about\nwhat the public expects look fairly good. Both survey data and the market prices of\ninflation-protected Treasury securities tell us that the public expects inflation to continue\nto be contained. I am confident that we at the Fed have the knowledge and the will to\nvalidate those expectations.\n\n4\n\n\f",

            "content": "Central Bank Credit in the Theory of Money and Payments\nThe Economics of Payments II Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York\nMarch 29, 2006\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nI’m honored to have the opportunity to speak at this conference, although I must admit\nthat I find the conference’s title a bit puzzling. I can certainly think of more than two\nconferences on payment economics. Why, the Richmond Fed alone has sponsored two;\none in 2000 and one way back in 1987.\nBut provenance aside, Jamie and Will and everyone else at the New York and Atlanta\nReserve Banks who have contributed to organizing and staging these two conferences\ndeserve our grateful commendations. Indeed, I’m quite heartened by the proliferation of\ngatherings like this, at which economic theory, econometric evidence and lessons from\nhistory are all brought to bear on questions surrounding payments systems. These\nconferences have been vital to the maturation of payment economics – the study of the\nmechanics of market exchange – as a distinct field of inquiry. Payment economics is no\nnarrow technical specialty, either: it builds on monetary theory, since use in payments\ndefines monetary instruments. It also draws on banking theory, based on the observation\nthat virtually all institutions that we usually think of as banks are significantly involved in\npayments intermediation.\nI want to talk this morning about the role of central bank credit in payments\narrangements. There is a voluminous practitioner literature that touches on this subject.\nMuch of it focuses on some of the terms on which credit is provided, and some recent\ndiscussion centers on the relative advantages of collateralization versus overdraft fees in\nmanaging the risks that arise from the provision of intraday central bank credit. I want to\noffer some thoughts on these issues, but my main purpose today is to explore what\npayment economics has to say about the role of central bank credit in the payments\nsystem.\nOne theme I will emphasize is that payments system policy – specifically, the terms on\nwhich daylight credit is offered – ought to be analyzed within the broader context of the\narray of central bank policies surrounding the provision of deposit accounts. This\nviewpoint naturally connects daylight credit policy to the lender of last resort function as\nwell as the operational mechanics of setting the overnight interbank interest rate. This\nviewpoint leads me quite naturally to a modest proposal for improving payments system\npolicy and the operations of monetary policy. I should emphasize at the outset that my\npolicy proposal is offered up in the spirit of academic inquiry, with the aim of stimulating\ndiscussion that will enhance our understanding of how best to achieve our policy goals. I\nshould also emphasize that the thoughts I’ll be sharing with you this morning are my\nown, and do not necessarily represent the views of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fCentral Banks in the Payment System\nCentral banks play a variety of roles in the payment system. The most fundamental, I\nwould argue, is providing banks with deposits and a means of transferring them to make\ninterbank payments. Modern central banks provide electronic transfer systems, but\nsystems based on paper or face-to-face payment orders go back centuries. Indeed,\nprototype central banks – that is, public sector institutions providing transferable deposits\nto banks for use in settlement – are documented in the early 1400s in the northern\nMediterranean (van Dillen, 1964, and Mueller, 1997). I recommend to you a recent\nAtlanta Fed working paper by Stephen Quinn and Will Roberds that provides an\nexcellent description and analysis of the 17th century Bank of Amsterdam, a prominent\nand well-documented example of this type of institution (Quinn and Roberds 2005).\nAdvances in the theory of payments have emphasized the role of communication and\nrecord-keeping in conveying information about the participants in an economic\ntransaction. The economic function of a payment instrument is to communicate reliably\n(that is, in an incentive compatible way) about the buyer’s past transactions (Townsend,\n1989, and Kocherlakota, 1998). Banks, from this perspective, are fundamentally\nspecialized institutions for issuing widely accepted payment instruments, in contrast to\ntheir traditionally emphasized role as balance-sheet intermediaries. Indeed, the provision\nof payments services, I believe, better defines banking than balance-sheet intermediation,\nwhich has been the traditional focus of banking economics, but which many other\nnonbanking institutions engage in as well.\nIssuing, clearing and settling payment instruments are essentially communication and\nrecord-keeping activities. The central role of communication technologies in payment\narrangements points, in modern settings, to the importance of economies of scale,\ncommon costs and joint production. These conditions can give rise to “network effects”\nin which much of the benefits and costs are shared among multiple participants. Private\norganizations that deal effectively with such technologies can be described as clubs, and\nthe theory of clubs teaches us that terms of membership are just as important as unit\nservice prices in inducing efficient participation in the presence of network effects.\nEfficient communication arrangements often take the form of networks in which many\npaths connect through a central node. A clearinghouse can be viewed as a natural club\narrangement for such centralized settlement activities. A central bank then represents a\nnationalized central settlement node for interbank payments. Contemporary legal\nrestrictions more or less compel most banks to settle through the central bank. Some\neconomists have argued that such nationalization was efficiency-enhancing (Goodhart,\n1988). For club goods, however, there is often a range of allocations consistent with\nefficiency – that is, with Pareto optimality. The formation of central banks may represent\nthe pursuit of a politically favored allocation of the net benefits of clearinghouse\narrangements. For example, research into the Federal Reserve’s entry into check\ncollection suggests that it was less about cost-efficiency than it was about shifting the\ncost of collecting checks drawn on country banks.\n\n2\n\n\fIf the fundamental core of central banking consists of interbank deposit services, then the\nfundamental core of central bank policy consists of all of the terms and conditions under\nwhich those deposit services are offered. These include the obvious pricing terms, such as\nthe nominal rate paid on deposits (zero at your Federal Reserve Bank) and the fee\ncharged for transferring funds. It also includes legal restrictions, such as reserve\nrequirements, that impose constraints on deposit holdings. The determination of the\nquantity of deposit liabilities supplied is also a component of central bank policy. Under\ncurrent U.S. arrangements, the New York Fed’s trading desk conducts daily open market\noperations so as to supply an amount of deposits expected to result in an interest rate on\novernight interbank loans equal to the target rate set by the Federal Open Market\nCommittee. Thus the phrase “central bank policy” should be construed here to include the\nmonetary policy operational regime, since, as I’ll argue below, it affects banks’ payment\nsystem choices. This connection between the Fed’s daylight credit arrangements and the\nbroader monetary regime implies that attempts to optimize each separately may not\ndeliver the best policies.\nCentral Bank Credit in the Payment System\nCentral banks have traditionally viewed the provision of credit to the banking system as\nan essential tool for achieving their goals. The lender-of-last-resort function is a widely\naccepted role for central banks to play in responding to emergency liquidity needs.\nBagehot’s prescription – to lend freely but only at a high rate on good collateral to\nsolvent institutions – is one of the most well-known maxims in central banking, although\nsome of these distinctions can be tricky to apply in practice.\nIt is important to recognize, however, that central bank lending involves two distinct\nactions. The first is an increase in the deposit account liabilities of the central bank. The\nsecond is the acquisition of a private liability. In Bagehot’s time, acquiring private\nliabilities was the main method of altering the aggregate supply of central bank deposit\nliabilities, and so the lender-of-last-resort policy he prescribed was the natural way to\nprovide for an elastic supply of deposits when demand for those deposits spiked. The\nfounding of the Federal Reserve System was motivated by a similar desire to prevent\ninterest rate spikes when the demand for reserves surged. The advent of open market\noperations in liquid government securities, however, made it less obvious that acquiring\nprivate liabilities was the best way to manage the supply of central bank deposits. Most\ncentral banks now treat open market operations aimed at pegging overnight interbank\ninterest rates as distinct from lending to individual banking institutions. In fact, pegging\ninterest rates automatically sterilizes the effect of such lending on aggregate deposit\nsupply. Discount window lending now represents a form of fiscal policy – a public sector\nloan to a private entity. It is no longer necessary to the provision of an elastic supply of\nreserves.\nThe lender-of-last-resort function typically involves overnight credit. Many central banks\nprovide intraday credit in the course of operating interbank payment systems that provide\npayment finality. Of course, daylight credit that is not extinguished by the end of the\n\n3\n\n\fprocessing day becomes overnight central bank credit of some form or another. Central\nbanks have taken different approaches to the provision of daylight credit. The Swiss used\nto just say no; now they lend via intraday repurchase agreements. Most central banks\nprovide daylight credit on fairly liberal terms. Many insist that such credit be fully\ncollateralized. The Fed currently allows daylight credit to be uncollateralized, but charges\na fee equivalent to 36 basis points at an annual rate on daylight credit above a certain\nthreshold.\nPayments Theory\nWhat does economics have to say about the role of central bank credit in the payments\nsystem? The nature of the problem provides some guidance, I believe, regarding the\nmethodology one needs to bring to bear. To evaluate the role of central bank credit, one\nneeds to assess the costs and benefits of alternative policy regimes governing the\nprovision of that credit. To do that, one needs to understand how bank behavior will\nchange when one changes central bank credit policy. In other words, how will deposit\nbalances and the timing and magnitude of payment flows differ from one regime to\nanother? Empirical analysis of payments systems data can provide some assistance here\nby providing an understanding of the underlying patterns of payment flows among banks.\nBut such analyses invariably run into the “Lucas Critique” – that is, that estimated\nrelationships from the status quo regime may shift dramatically in response to a change in\nregime. To the extent that one is evaluating an alternative regime that differs substantially\nfrom current policy, one must identify the “structural” determinants of bank behavior that\nare invariant across regimes. Thus, evaluating alternative payment policy regimes calls\nfor a theoretical framework, although observations from history or across countries might\nalso provide some insights. The analysis of a system’s likely response to a major shift in\npolicy requires a plausible model that incorporates the effects of central bank policy on\nequilibrium private sector behavior.\nWhat should we look for in models of payment activity? One important principle is\nembodied in William Baxter’s (1983) Dictum—that the issuance, use, clearing and\nsettlement of a payment instrument is a service of joint benefit to the buyer and the seller\nand that service is provided jointly by all parties to clearing and settlement. As a result, a\nsound economic evaluation of alternative payment policies requires assessing the effect\nof those alternatives on the well-being of and costs incurred by all of the parties involved.\nModels that omit the parties for whom banks are clearing and settling payments – the\n“end-users” – will fail to satisfy Baxter’s Dictum, and will be potentially misleading.\nAs I mentioned earlier, payments arrangements are communications networks, and these\noften take the form of club goods. Private agents that find themselves in such\nenvironments will tend to create multilateral institutions to efficiently cope with their\ninterdependencies. A good payments model should recognize that payment instruments\nand institutions are not exogenous, but are determined by the nature of the information\nand other frictions facing traders in the model environment. This endogeneity of payment\nbehavior is what makes the application of carefully specified models essential for\nthinking about the consequences of significant changes in central bank policies.\n\n4\n\n\fViewing instruments and institutions as endogenous adaptations to the structure of the\neconomy has important methodological implications. First, whenever possible, models of\npayment behavior should be fully articulated general equilibrium models, specified, in\nthe words of an old but useful slogan, at the level of preferences, endowments and\ntechnologies. This is essential for drawing welfare conclusions about alternative policies.\nSecond, the endogeneity of institutions places mechanism design at the heart of payments\ntheory, as is true for modern monetary theory. Under a mechanism design approach,\npayment instruments are seen as messages that embody contingent contracts, and one can\nmodel the information and risk allocation characteristics in a way that takes into account\nthe limitations imposed by real-world payment technologies – for example, the costliness\nand falsifiability of communication, verification and authentication.\nThe Freeman Model\nScott Freeman (1996) developed a model that meets these criteria and has proven useful\nfor studying the role of central bank credit in settlement arrangements. In the\nenvironment of the Freeman Model, both fiat money and private liabilities serve as means\nof payment. Moreover, each period many agents meet at a central location, some bearing\nprivate payment instruments that they want to exchange for money, and others bearing\nmoney with which they will redeem their debt. The (exogenous) timing of agents’\narrivals and departures are such that early in the meeting there is an imbalance between\nagents bearing debt they wish to redeem for money and agents with money to offer for\ndebt. Without central bank intervention, the debt sells at a discount early in the period, an\ninefficiency relative to frictionless settlement. In this model, the central bank can\npurchase debt for newly minted money and later retire that money by presenting the debt\nto issuers for payment.\nThe Freeman Model was developed to study the central bank’s ability to accommodate a\ntemporary bulge in the demand for money in connection with settlement in a way that\ndoes not create inflation. Freeman makes reference to Milton Friedman and Anna\nSchwartz’s (1963) discussion of seasonal movements in money demand in the U.S.\nduring the 19th century. But the series of central bank transactions described above can\nbe interpreted as a short-term or even intraday loan from the central bank to the issuer of\nthe debts. Under this interpretation, Ruilin Zhou (2000) has shown that the optimal terms\nfor the central bank transaction are equivalent to daylight credit at a zero interest rate.\nOne important observation on the Freeman model is due to Ed Green (1997). By\nconstructing a mechanism by which a coalition of private agents can achieve the same\noutcome as central bank intervention in the Freeman Model, Green showed that central\nbank credit was not essential for achieving an optimal allocation. In fact, the coalition\ndescribed by Green’s Theorem resembles the private clearinghouses which stood at the\napex of the U.S. clearing and settlement systems before the creation of the Federal\nReserve. This result highlights the lesson that the need for (perhaps quite complicated)\nmultilateral coordination does not by itself create a need for public sector involvement in\na payments system. This lesson is buttressed by the observation that many private net\n\n5\n\n\fsettlement arrangements exist alongside central bank gross settlement systems. As I noted\nearlier, this reasoning suggests that the question of the central bank role in payments is\nless about efficiency and more about the distribution of costs and benefits.\nAnother important observation on the Freeman Model involves its finding that the\noptimal interest rate on intraday central bank credit is equal to zero. A key feature of his\nenvironment that helps deliver this result is the absence of intraday discounting. An\ninterest rate is the intertemporal price of consumption, and in the Freeman model,\nconsumption is discounted only period-to-period, not within the settlement period. This\namounts to saying that there is no within period (intraday) opportunity cost of\nconsumption or money, an assumption that may or may not be a good approximation to\nthe operation of large value payments systems. Whether it makes sense to posit that all\ndiscounting takes place overnight is an important open research question, especially when\nthe overnight period lasts just 2 ½ hours, as it does for Fedwire.\nIt is worth noting that the motivation for daylight credit in the Freeman Model is\nunrelated to any risk of so-called “gridlock.” People describe gridlock as occurring when\nbanks strategically delay payments within the day, thereby increasing the system’s\nprocessing burden late in the day. The option to delay payment is not available in the\nFreeman Model. In more general settings, one important question regarding the potential\nfor gridlock is the extent to which repeated interaction can constrain the incentive for\nstrategic misbehavior. It is also worth considering whether gridlock could itself be a\nconsequence of the status quo policy regime.\nYet another noteworthy feature of the Freeman Model is that the central bank’s extension\nof daylight credit is risk-free. From this perspective, one might view a daylight overdraft\nfee as compensation for risk. Ideally, one would want to set this fee in Pigovian fashion\nso as to eliminate banks’ incentives to overuse daylight credit. One might think that\nsetting the fee at a level that compensates the central bank for its credit-risk exposure\nwould do the trick, but this would ignore the role of the deposit insurance fund. A central\nbank’s claim on a failing bank’s collateral simply reduces the liquidation value of the\ninstitution and thereby increases the cost to the deposit insurance fund. Moreover, central\nbank lending can allow the chartering agency to delay closure and facilitate the exit of\nuninsured creditors, further shifting losses from private counterparties to the public sector\nand exacerbating moral hazard. Either way, Federal Reserve risk exposure is the wrong\nmetric against which to benchmark overdraft fees. It is essential, in my view, to evaluate\nthe risks associated with central bank credit from the comprehensive perspective of the\nconsolidated fiscal balance sheet rather than from a purely central bank point of view.\nWhile it is widely recognized that credit risk is an element of the benefit-cost calculus\nsurrounding daylight credit, assessment of this risk is fraught with difficulty. When\nfinancial conditions are generally strong, the risk of actual loss due to daylight credit\nexposure is likely to be small, and even a small benefit in the form of a smoother\nfunctioning payment system might appear to make the provision of central bank credit\nworthwhile. Daylight credit is often particularly useful during a severe operational\ndisruption, as illustrated by the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\n6\n\n\f(Lacker, 2004) While some banks delayed payments out of concerns about incoming\nfunds, the availability of daylight credit built confidence that payments would flow.\n(McAndrews, 2002) On September 11, the general condition of the banking system was\nquite strong. Should a major operational disruption occur when some financial\ninstitutions are generally more fragile, then an expansion of central bank credit could\ninvolve a substantial increase in exposure.\nOperational disruptions aside, weak banking institutions can create broader moral hazard\nproblems regarding daylight credit. Large banks build sophisticated payment processing\nsystems assuming the availability of automatic daylight credit. Reconfiguring a bank’s\noperations to cope with a denial of daylight credit can be very costly and highly visible to\ncounterparties. This makes it difficult for the Federal Reserve to withdraw daylight credit\nin the case of weak or failing institutions, and this in turn can substantially weaken\nmarket and supervisory discipline.\nReserves versus Payments Credit\nThe Freeman Model has been cited as support for minimal daylight overdraft fees, but I\nwould like to explore an alternative central bank policy regime that involves no daylight\ncredit at all. Under this regime, the Fed would automatically “sweep” the overnight\nexcess reserve balances of banks into reverse repurchase agreements. Specifically, at the\nclose of Fedwire (6:30 p.m.) we would sell them U.S. Treasury securities in exchange for\nall of their excess reserve balance. At the opening of Fedwire on “the following day”\n(actually 9:00 p.m. the same night) the transaction would be reversed; we would buy back\nthe securities and credit their account for the purchase amount, plus interest. Upon\ninitiation of the service, the Fed would conduct a large one-time open market purchase of\nsecurities during the day to start the program up with abundant daylight reserves.\nIf the interest rate were set close to or at the target fed funds rate, this scheme would\nallow us to curtail daylight credit without imposing much cost on banks. For every dollar\nof daylight credit we withdraw, we could supply an additional dollar of daylight reserves\nvia the initial open market purchase. In the limit, we could withdraw all access to\ndaylight credit and increase the aggregate supply of daylight reserves by the maximum\namount of daylight credit usage. In principle, any pattern of intraday payments that is\nfeasible under current policy would still be feasible; no change in the timing of payments\nwould be necessary.\nThe obvious cost to a bank of substituting overnight balances for daylight credit is the\nforegone interest on overnight balances. A Fed sweeps service would virtually eliminate\nthe opportunity cost of holding large daylight balances if the interest rate was set at the\novernight federal funds target rate. This illustrates the extent to which the demand for\ndaylight credit can be viewed as driven by the tax on Fed deposits due to the lack of\ninterest on reserves. Banks could hold large overnight balances now if they so desired,\nbut they prefer to use daylight credit and hold quite minimal balances beyond those\nneeded to meet reserve requirements.\n\n7\n\n\fNote that this policy is equivalent to the optimal policy recommended by the Freeman\nModel of intraday purchases of securities that are reversed at the end of the day. The\nsweeps service would withdraw substantial balances at the end of the settlement day and\nthen inject them back in at the beginning of the next day. But the sweeps plan I described\nwould not be feasible in the Freeman Model, because different agents participate in the\nsettlement meeting each period. Thus, the Freeman Model does not provide opportunities\nto substitute overnight balances for daylight credit. This illustrates the source of the\nFreeman Model’s crisp prediction regarding daylight credit interest rates: the market for\ndaylight credit is sharply segmented from overnight asset markets. This suggests that to\nfully understand the economics of daylight central bank credit we need models that allow\nfor nontrivial substitution between overnight balances and daylight credit.\nIn the Freeman Model, the central bank acquires the private payment liabilities that give\nrise to the daylight demand for money, while the sweeps proposal is agnostic on the debt\nused in the overnight reverse repurchase agreements, although U.S. Treasury securities\nare the natural candidate given the existing Fed book-entry securities service. Of course,\nprivate payment liabilities are the only debt in the Freeman Model, so no meaningful\nquestion arises there, but this points to what might be the most essential difference\nbetween various central bank daylight credit policy regimes: namely, the nature of the\nfinancial claims the central bank acquires. Under current Fed policy, the Federal Reserve\nBanks take unsecured claims when they provide daylight credit, although operating\ncirculars create a lien on any bank collateral that happens to be pledged for use in\novernight borrowing, so perhaps it is best to describe Fed daylight credit as partially\nsecured. Central banks that require full collateralization of daylight overdrafts often allow\na range of assets to serve as collateral – similar to the Fed’s policies for discount window\ncollateral. It is beyond my scope here, but the question of the appropriate collateral for\ncentral bank credit exposure is an open question that involves deeper issues surrounding\nthe financial safety net and related moral hazard considerations. But note that the sweeps\nservice I have described is nearly equivalent to collateralized daylight credit, if the\neligible collateral and repurchase transactions are limited to the same set of assets.\nAside on simplifying monetary policy implementation\nOne side benefit of the sweeps service I have described is that it would allow us to\nsimplify monetary policy operations. At present, New York Fed staff essentially\nestimates the banking system’s demand for excess reserves each day at the funds rate\ntarget and they supply that amount through open market operations. In the process, they\nmust estimate a variety of “technical” influences on the reserves market – changes in\nTreasury balances, for example. The New York Fed staff generally intervenes only once\neach day, however, usually in the morning. Unanticipated disturbances to reserve supply\nor demand can occur after they have intervened, and these can drive the market federal\nfunds rate away from the target. Although it is unclear whether there are significant\nwelfare costs of intraday fed funds rate volatility, substantial resources are devoted to\nassembling data and estimating reserve factors.\n\n8\n\n\fWith a sweep service in place paying interest at the target rate, monetary policy\noperations could in principle be substantially simplified by supplying, via open market\npurchases, more reserves than the banking system wishes to hold. No bank would lend\novernight funds in the market at less than the rate on our sweep service. And a bank in\nneed of borrowed funds could always find a willing lender at a risk-adjusted spread over\nthe sweep rate. The market funds rate thus would not rise above the sweep rate, except to\nreflect borrower-specific risk. The New York Fed staff would merely need to provide an\namount of reserves that will be sufficient to oversupply the system with reserves and\nmeet daylight settlement needs. But they would not need to estimate daily reserves\npositions as precisely as they do now, because a “miss” would rarely affect the funds rate.\nIt’s easy to think of interesting questions about how one would implement an idea like\nthis. For instance, because of some peculiar accounting rules, banks’ overnight reverse\nrepurchase holdings “uses balance sheet” and could require costly additions to capital for\nparticipating banks. If so, then even a rate equal to the target rate would not necessarily\nfully eliminate the opportunity cost of excess reserves. This and other interesting\nquestions merit careful further analysis. But the proposal demonstrates my theme that\ncentral payment credit should be understood whenever possible in the context of the\nbroader set of monetary arrangements in place. This, by the way, is a point that is made\nvery cleanly by the Freeman model.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by emphasizing what I think are two key lessons from the theory of\npayments. First, understanding payments arrangements and the appropriate role of the\ncentral bank requires a clear understanding of private arrangements and private incentives\nin settings where the services (like payment clearing and settlement) involve multilateral\nbenefits and shared costs. That is, models of payment behavior and analyses of payment\npolicy should respect Baxter’s Dictum to evaluate effects on all parties to a payment\narrangement. The Freeman Model, and other models derived from modern monetary\ntheory are typically very diligent in this regard. Even so, it is hard in such models to\nidentify imperfections that a central bank or other public entity is uniquely suited to\nresolve. As demonstrated by Green’s Theorem, pairing Baxter’s Dictum with a\nmechanism design approach makes clear the strong incentives that private agents have to\nfind efficient arrangements, and this is the second lesson. The network nature of\npayments systems should not be taken to imply the existence of market failures when\nvoluntary, multilateral arrangements are capable of incorporating all of the affected\nparties.\n\n9\n\n\fReferences\nVan Dillen, J.G., 1964.

            "content": "Transition and Continuity at the Federal Reserve in 2006\nAcordia/Royal & SunAlliance Distinguished Lecture Series\nWest Virginia University\nMorgantown, West Virginia\nFebruary 14, 2006\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nI would like to talk to you tonight about the evolution in the way the Federal Reserve\ngoes about conducting monetary policy. As my title suggests, one theme is that a\ntransition is taking place. Of course, the most striking transition at the Federal Reserve\nthis year is the change in leadership. On January 31, Federal Reserve Board Chairman\nAlan Greenspan served his last day in office and chaired his last meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee. His successor, Ben Bernanke, took over the following day, and\ntomorrow morning, he delivers his first testimony to Congress as chairman.\nMuch has been written and said recently about this changing of the guard. It is quite\nnatural in such circumstances for commentators to contrast an influential leader and his\nsuccessor and to look for likely differences in philosophy and practice. But in my\nopinion, too much has been made of their differences. Thus, the second theme of my talk:\ncontinuity. In remarks upon the announcement of his nomination, Bernanke very\ndeliberately emphasized the stability of monetary policy. He stated that his “first priority\nwill be to maintain continuity with the policies and policy strategies established during\nthe Greenspan years.” But I won’t ask you to take his word for it. Tonight, I hope to\nconvince you that a careful student of the Federal Reserve should have good reason to\nbelieve that the practice of monetary policy will continue to evolve gradually. I will argue\nthat a certain economic logic has influenced the way policy and practice evolved during\nthe Greenspan years, and that that logic will continue to influence the evolution of policy\nduring the Bernanke years. In particular, the stability of the public’s understanding of and\nexpectations about the future conduct of monetary policy have been central to Chairman\nGreenspan’s success. As a consequence, the Federal Reserve has found it useful to\nsteadily make the conduct of monetary policy more transparent. This logic is likely to\ncontinue to hold sway, and thus the Fed is likely to continue to emphasize credibility and\nenhanced transparency.\nLet me be clear, however. Understanding the economic logic of the evolution of\nmonetary policy over the last several decades should take nothing away from the\nsignificant achievements of Alan Greenspan. He served as Fed chairman for more than\n18-and-a-half years and his record during that time was exemplary. Under his leadership,\nthe Federal Reserve brought inflation down to historically low levels, which contributed\nto a period of extended economic expansion interrupted by only two brief and mild\nrecessions. Indeed, the term “The Great Moderation” has been given to the phenomenal\nimprovement in macroeconomic performance during the period following the mid-1980s,\n\n\fjust before Greenspan took over. In essence, he successfully completed the task begun by\nhis predecessor, Paul Volcker, of re-establishing the expectation of price stability that had\nbeen lost in the inflationary decade of the 1970s.\nWe are fortunate to have in Ben Bernanke a new chairman who has experience in\npolicymaking and has made important contributions to our understanding of monetary\neconomics. He is well-versed in both the economic logic of monetary policy and the\nresearch devoted to dissecting the great monetary policy mistakes of the 1930s and\n1970s. He is therefore eminently qualified to continue to lead Fed policymaking along the\npath laid out by his predecessors. And his public comments thus far, particularly in his\nconfirmation hearings, suggest that we can expect the type of continuity in Fed\npolicymaking that I’ll be talking about this evening.\nI should say at the outset that, as always, my remarks reflect my own views and not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\n***\nMany observers, myself included, have argued that one of the hallmarks of the Greenspan\nlegacy is adherence to a systematic approach to policymaking. 1 The value of a systematic\napproach to monetary policy goes beyond the usefulness of minimizing unexpected\ndeviations from what the public anticipates. The purpose of monetary policy, after all, is\nto stabilize the value of money, and the value people place on money today depends\ncritically on what value people expect money to have in the near future, which depends in\nturn on what value people expect money to have a bit further into the future, and so on.\nThe future conduct of monetary policy is thus a fundamental determinant of the value of\nmoney. Therefore, the key to stabilizing the value of money is getting people to\nunderstand the systematic conduct of monetary policy.\nBut saying that Greenspan introduced systematic policymaking is not quite right – and\nnot quite enough. After all, monetary policy during the inflationary 1970s was just as\nsystematic. An econometrician could estimate a statistical relationship between\nmacroeconomic variables and the Fed’s policy actions in the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed,\nmany econometricians have estimated such relationships, and they tend to fit pretty well.\nBut those relationships generally differ from what you get when you estimate\nrelationships for the Volcker or Greenspan years. The question, then, is just what\nsystematic relationship the Fed follows.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s monetary policy typically allowed inflation to rise noticeably\nduring economic expansions. As the economy recovered from a recession and growth\npicked up, the Fed kept interest rates from rising as much as they should. In fact, at times,\nthe Fed failed to raise nominal interest rates by as much as inflation was increasing. This\ncaused real (that is, inflation-adjusted) interest rates to fall and, thus, provided further\nmonetary stimulus at precisely the wrong time. The acceleration of inflation ultimately\nprovoked a sharp tightening in policy, which often exacerbated or even caused an ensuing\nrecession. Policymakers’ fear of even further deepening the slump led them to ease policy\n\n2\n\n\fbefore inflation had fully subsided. So inflation was essentially ratcheting upward\nthroughout the period before 1980.\nAn important part of the economic instability of the 1970s can be attributed to the fact\nthat the public’s inflation expectations became untethered. For a long time before, indeed\nfor centuries, inflation expectations had been anchored by commodity standards – that is,\nby arrangements that tied the value of money to the value of one or more precious metals\nlike gold or silver. Under a commodity standard, inflation wasn’t eliminated, since\nchanges in the supply and demand conditions for the commodity to which money was\nlinked could change the value of money. But over the long run, the real value of a\ncommodity like gold is determined by the cost of extraction, and this tended to be fairly\nstable. Thus, commodity standards provided people with confidence that movements in\nthe value of money would not be persistent and that inflation would ultimately settle back\ndown to low levels.\nThe 20th century saw a gradual but steady departure from the gold standard, culminating\nin the closing of the U.S. “gold window” in 1971. It is not surprising that expectational\nstability would have been lost around the same time. When inflation was observed to rise\nin the 1970s, the public saw no obvious mechanism in place for bringing it back down,\nand so higher inflation became built into people’s long-run expectations. The story of the\nVolcker-Greenspan era, then, is the story of how expectational stability was restored –\nthe story of how the Fed regained the public’s confidence that it would and could keep\ninflation low and stable.\nThe emergence of persistent inflation expectations on the part of the public during the\n1970s was one factor that contributed to important developments in the discipline of\nmacroeconomics. Before the 1970s, the consensus framework for understanding the\neffects of monetary policy treated the public’s expectations about future inflation as a\nfixed parameter, unaffected by the actual current conduct of monetary policy. That\nframework contributed to the policy errors of that period by encouraging policymakers to\ndiscount the possibility that public expectation would shift over time in response to the\nactual conduct of policy.\nEconomists already had begun to think more carefully about how the public’s\nexpectations are formed, and in the 1970s, they had begun to study models in which the\npublic’s expectations were tied very tightly to how policy would actually be conducted.\nThe experience of the 1970s confirmed the importance of this link by teaching us,\nessentially, that you can’t fool all the people all the time. People learn from what they\nsee, and it was unreasonable to assume that people would continue to expect inflation to\nsettle down to low levels when they kept seeing inflation continue to ratchet up. The\nmodels developed in the 1970s provided a compelling diagnosis of the deterioration in\ninflation we witnessed that decade: monetary policy had a systematic inflationary bias,\nand the public had come to understand that and behave accordingly. Those models also\nprovided the Fed with a prescription: systematically adhere to, and convince the public\nwe would systematically adhere to, a non-inflationary monetary policy.\n\n3\n\n\fThat prescription is easier written than followed, however. Merely announcing an\nintention to bring inflation down is not sufficient. After all, the Federal Reserve had been\npublicly advocating lower inflation throughout the 1970s. We needed a way to\nconvincingly demonstrate our commitment to bringing inflation down. The Fed began\nthis process in October 1979, under Chairman Paul Volcker, by allowing interest rates to\nrise sharply and withstanding a deep recession while inflation ratcheted down. Thereafter,\nthe Fed often had to raise the fed funds rate in response to signs of rising inflation, or in\nresponse to inflation scares – that is, signs from the bond market that inflation\nexpectations were rising. Over time, however, inflation has stabilized at a low level and\ninflation scares have become much less frequent as the public has learned that the Fed\nwould respond systematically in a way designed to keep inflation low and steady.\nThe conduct of monetary policy in the last two decades has brought us to a very favorable\nplace. Inflation is low and stable, and the public appears to be fairly confident that\ninflation will remain persistently low and stable. This is the Greenspan legacy, and it is\nnow our responsibility, under the leadership of the new chairman, to preserve that\ncredibility.\nThe challenge of fulfilling that responsibility in the period ahead will be analytically\ndemanding. For how does one conduct monetary policy when inflation is low and stable?\nHere we can draw on our understanding from a class of models that researchers have\ndeveloped and studied in the last decade or two. While this research program is still in\nprogress and important open questions remain, a few clear principles have emerged. First,\nholding interest rates steady until inflation or deflation pressures are actually visible is\nclearly inappropriate. Instead, policy should be conducted recognizing that real interest\nrates should be expected to fluctuate with economic conditions. A real interest rate is the\nrelative price of current resources in terms of future resources. It represents the real\namount of goods and services one must sacrifice in the future (in addition to the\nrepayment of principal) to obtain real goods and services today. As I have emphasized\nelsewhere, real interest rates should be expected to fluctuate over time in response to\nvariations in the relative pressure on current versus future resources. 2 When current\nresource demand is less than it will be in the near future – as was the case from 2001\nthrough the beginning of 2004 – then real interest rates need to be low to reflect the\nrelative lack of pressure on current resources. When that relative pressure on current\nresources rises, as has been happening over the last two years, then real interest rates\nneed to rise. In such circumstances, if the Fed sets and keeps the funds rate too low, the\ninevitable result will be rising inflation.\nThe behavior of the Fed thus has evolved in a way that is consistent with the evolution of\nour understanding of the macroeconomy and of how inflation, growth, and interest rates\ninteract over time. Alan Greenspan’s leadership was vital to this evolution. He\nunderstood the importance of stabilizing the public’s expectations regarding future\nmonetary policy. He proved highly skilled at sensing the evolution of those expectations,\nand at influencing them through the practice of monetary policy. And his focus on the\nFed’s credibility dovetailed with advances in economic research both inside and outside\nthe Federal Reserve. It’s fitting, then, that leadership of the Fed should now pass to Ben\n\n4\n\n\fBernanke who, in addition to his previous experience on the FOMC, has made quite\nimportant contributions to research on monetary policy during his academic career.\n***\nThe importance of expectations and how policy effectiveness hinges on expectations is\none of the most significant contributions of macroeconomic research in recent decades.\nGiven this importance, one might wonder whether a central bank can influence\nexpectations through means other than its own rate-setting behavior. In particular, what\nrole can or should communication by the Federal Reserve play in shaping the public’s\nexpectations?\nBy itself, communication is not a particularly powerful tool for influencing people’s\nbeliefs. To be effective, communication needs to be backed up by and consistent with the\nactual policy behavior. Otherwise, listeners tend to discount what the policymaker says in\nfavor of how the policymaker behaves. Thus the popular aphorism: “Actions speak\nlouder than words.” Words can matter, however, if the public believes that the\npolicymaker will feel compelled to live up to them. A central banker who pledges to keep\ninflation low but then persistently lets it rise runs the risk of not being believed the next\ntime around. This risk strongly discourages making empty promises. Thus, a clear central\nbank commitment to a policy objective can influence the public’s expectations.\nOne widely noticed feature of the Greenspan legacy is the dramatic increase in\ntransparency during his tenure. This is especially apparent in the Fed’s communications\nregarding policy actions. Before 1994, the FOMC released only a difficult-to-interpret\ndocument called the “directive” regarding the supply of bank reserves to the market, and\nthen only after the following meeting, when it had been superseded. Faced with this\n“radio silence,” an industry of Fed-watchers developed to try to infer policy decisions\nfrom market movements after a meeting.\nIn a series of steps beginning in 1994, the FOMC began to expand the amount of\ninformation released to the public immediately following a meeting. First, the intended\ntarget for the federal funds rate was released immediately following the meeting. This\nwas then supplemented by a “balance of risks assessment,” which was often described as\nindicating the “tilt” in policy – that is, whether an increase or a decrease in the funds rate\nwas relatively more likely at coming meetings. Over time, the statements gradually\nincluded more discussion of current and prospective economic conditions. Finally, in\n2005, the FOMC began releasing the full minutes three weeks following the meeting,\nrather than after the subsequent meeting, as had been the practice.\nBack in 2003, the FOMC began issuing statements that sent fairly explicit signals about\nthe likely path for the funds rate. Early in 2003, core inflation had drifted down to 1\npercent. The statement released following the May meeting that year made reference to\n“an unwelcome further fall in inflation.” This was something of a watershed in Fed\nhistory – the first time in our modern experience that inflation threatened to fall too low.\nThe language labeling a further fall in inflation as “unwelcome” conveyed the\n\n5\n\n\fCommittee’s intention to keep core inflation above 1 percent. At the next meeting in late\nJune, the FOMC lowered the fed funds rate to 1 percent and repeated the “unwelcome”\nreference. After the August meeting, the statement said that “policy accommodation can\nbe maintained for a considerable period.” This too was a watershed – explicit\ncommunication about the likely future path of the policy instrument. Since then the\nCommittee has continued to communicate about the likely near-term policy path, using\nphrases like “can be patient” and “a pace that is likely to be measured.”\nThis series of moves toward greater and more timely communication form a natural\nprogression. For decades, the Fed has articulated its desire for low and stable inflation. In\nthe 1990s, the FOMC went beyond general goals and began disclosing current policy\nactions and their rationale, thus providing information on how past policy actions had\nbeen affected by current and prospective economic conditions. The balance of risks\nstatement broke new ground by communicating, though somewhat elliptically, about the\nlikely near-term policy direction. The forward-looking language used since 2003 has in\nturn provided richer insights into the policy actions that the Committee believes it would\nhave to take to achieve its goals.\nI can understand why this progression took as long as it did. Starting from a status quo in\nwhich the Fed provided very little up-to-the-minute information on its policy, small\ninitial steps were probably warranted. Too abrupt a change may have temporarily created\nuncertainty in the markets about the meaning of the information coming out of the Fed,\nalthough clearly, over time, market participants would learn how to interpret Fed\nstatements. If that uncertainty fed into market volatility, even as a transitory matter while\nmarkets learned about the new format, then transparency skeptics might have been able to\nuse that volatility as an argument against sharing information with the public.\nI think it is important to be clear about what the Committee communicates when it\ncomments on the near-term policy direction. Central banks set interest rates in response\nto incoming economic data. What ultimately drives that data is the evolution of economic\nfundamentals – that is, the evolution of technologies and external factors like world\ncommodity prices. So the current policy rate should be thought of as a function (though\nprobably a fairly complicated one) of the fundamentals – that’s what systematic policy\nmeans. When the FOMC communicates about the likely future path of policy rates, as it\ndid from mid-2003 on, it is communicating about two separate things at once – first, how\nfundamentals are likely to evolve, and second, how policy is likely to react to those\nfundamentals. I believe there are important roles for both, but that it is important to\ndistinguish between the two.\nThe striking feature of the period since mid-2003 has been that the likely evolution of\neconomic fundamentals and the likely policy reaction have combined to make the likely\npath of our policy instrument, the fed funds rate, relatively clear. Beginning in early\n2004, for example, it was clear that short-term interest rates were going to have to rise\nsteadily as the economy recovered and made the transition to a sustained growth path.\nHaving now moved much closer to such a growth path, however, it may be much less\n\n6\n\n\fcommon for the FOMC to find itself willing and able to forecast an extended string of\nrate changes.\nBut if the federal funds rate path becomes less predictable than it has been over the last\n14 FOMC meetings, does that mean that the Committee must retreat to saying little\nbeyond announcing its rate decisions when they are made? In my opinion, no. My sense\nis that there will still be room for forward-looking communications that entail more\nconditional statements about how policy is likely to react to evolving economic\nfundamentals, in contrast to the less conditional statements common since 2003. I opened\nmy remarks tonight by noting the importance of systematic public expectations regarding\nmonetary policy. Building better public understanding of how policy systematically\nresponds to evolving economic conditions is the key to enhancing our credibility and\nimproving the effectiveness of monetary policy.\nBeyond moving to more conditional forward-looking language, I think there is probably\nmore that can be done to build systematic public understanding. An important component\nof that understanding is the public’s sense of our long-run intentions for inflation. Several\nFOMC members, myself included, have indicated the level or range of inflation that they\nwould like to see prevail over the long run, but the Committee itself has not formally\nadopted such a goal or target for inflation. Providing quantitative guidance to the public\nabout the Committee’s long-run inflation intentions would have the benefit of reducing\nuncertainty about future monetary policy, and more securely anchoring long-run inflation\nexpectations.\nIn his nomination hearings last November, Chairman Bernanke acknowledged that he has\nsupported the idea of a quantitative inflation objective in academic writings and in\nspeeches as a member of the Board of Governors. But he assured the senators that, if\nconfirmed, he would “take no precipitate steps” in this direction, and he indicated that the\nidea “requires further study … as well as extensive discussion and consultation.” He went\non to say that he would act only if a “consensus” develops that doing so would further\nenhance our ability to achieve our mandated objectives. I have already expressed my own\nsupport for such a formal quantitative statement as a means of providing an anchor for\nlong-term inflation expectations, 3 and I look forward to further study and discussion of\nthe issue under Chairman Bernanke’s leadership.\nI suspect that the next frontier in Fed communications will involve the framework we use\nfor policy analysis. After we have had some practice at communicating our past actions\nand how we are likely to respond in the future, it will be time to communicate more about\nwhy we will respond the way we will respond. Admittedly, this will be a tougher nut to\ncrack, if only because of the genuine scientific uncertainty that typically surrounds\neconomic inferences. But to the extent that a reasonably firm consensus can be obtained\non some basic principles, I believe that it would aid public understanding for us to find\nways to communicate them. Public understanding of the economic reasoning underlying\nour policy choices would help prevent drawing the wrong lessons from history.\n\n7\n\n\fFor example, the initial response of market participants to the spike in energy prices that\nfollowed Hurricane Katrina suggested that people considered it possible or even likely\nthat the FOMC would pause in its sequence of rate hikes, and that we would be willing to\ntolerate an acceleration in broader measures of inflation in response to the energy price\nincreases. In the popular media, this expectation was tied to the experience with energy\nprice shocks in the 1970s. But as I’ve already emphasized, the systematic part of policy\nin the 1970s was very different from what it became in the Greenspan years. Such\nmisunderstandings can create challenges for policymakers. If the public comes to expect\nrising inflation, based on an outdated view of how policy responds to an economic shock,\nthen the task of preventing a rise in inflation is made more difficult.\nI commented earlier about the nature of monetary policy when inflation is low and stable.\nI emphasized that real, inflation-adjusted interest rates should be expected to fluctuate in\nsuch circumstances, even in the absence of visible fluctuations in inflation pressures.\nWith inflation low and steady, changes in real interest rates require changes in the\nnominal overnight policy rate that the Fed directly controls. Communicating that fact will\nhelp the public understand that policy needs to respond to changing real economic\nconditions. Moreover, focusing on real interest rates draws attention to how and why\npolicy must respond; real interest rates must fluctuate to accommodate changes in the\nrelative pressure on current versus future resources. Widespread understanding of this\nwould have aided the market response to Katrina; the storm impaired the supply of\ncurrent resources relative to the future, and so, if anything real interest rates had to rise,\nnot fall.\n***\nTo sum up, then, Chairman Greenspan’s success was predicated on establishing\ncredibility – that is, widespread public confidence that the future conduct of monetary\npolicy would keep inflation low and stable. Building that confidence through actions\nalone was insufficient, and the Greenspan Fed began to expand communications, first\nabout current policy actions, then about likely prospective actions. To maintain and build\ncredibility, we are likely to continue to look for ways to enhance communications in the\nyears ahead. Our efforts in this direction will be informed both by a rich history of\nexperience with monetary policy and by a growing body of knowledge gained from\nviewing that history through the lens of economic logic.\nOn a personal note, I have known Ben Bernanke professionally since shortly after the\npublication of his influential 1983 paper on money and credit in the Great Depression. He\nis an outstanding monetary economist but also an imminently sensible monetary policy\npractitioner. I am looking forward with enthusiasm to serving in the Bernanke Fed.\nLooking back, I count it an extraordinary honor and privilege to have served under\nChairman Greenspan since mid-2004.\n\n8\n\n\f1\n\nSee, for example, Janet Yellen, “2006: A Year of Transition at the Federal Reserve,” Jan. 19, 2006, or\nJeffrey Lacker, “Interest Rate Policy After Greenspan,” Winthrop University, Oct. 20, 2005.\n2\nJeffrey Lacker, “Interest Rate Policy After Greenspan,” Winthrop University, Oct. 20, 2005.\n3\nJeffrey Lacker, “Inflation Targeting and the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” University of Richmond,\nMarch 1, 2005.\n\n9\n\n\f",

            "content": "The Economic Outlook for 2006\nRisk Management Association, Richmond Chapter\nRichmond, Virginia\nJanuary 20, 2006\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the economic outlook for 2006 and\nbeyond. It is a pleasure, in part, because the economic outlook is fairly encouraging.\nGrowth is on a solid footing, despite this year’s run-up in energy prices and the\ndisruptions of a devastating hurricane season. And after a brief pause this fall,\nemployment is expanding again at a healthy pace, consumer spending continues to grow\nbriskly, and business investment spending is robust. Granted, housing activity seems to\nbe softening, and at least some potential price level pressures remain, so it may be too\nsoon to break out the champagne. But inflation expectations remain contained, and we at\nthe Fed are well-positioned to resist inflation pressures, should they emerge.\nSo all in all, it is quite a good outlook.\nIn my remarks today, I would like to review the economic outlook in a bit more detail,\nand then talk about monetary policy. As always, my remarks reflect my own views, and\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\nThe really striking feature of the current outlook is the extent to which economic activity\nin general and consumer spending in particular has rebounded from the shock of last\nyear’s hurricane season. In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, fears were\nwidespread that consumers might pull back sharply on spending, both in response to\nsharply higher retail gasoline prices and out of a general sense of heightened anxiety\nabout potential fallout from the storm damage.\nSurvey measures of consumer confidence, which plummeted in September, seemed to\nbolster this view. But the effect of the storms on consumer outlays have turned out to be\nfar more limited than expected, exemplifying the oft-cited resilience of the U.S.\neconomy. Apart from auto sales, which slid following expiration of the summer’s\n“employee discount” promotions, retail sales have held up fairly well and overall\nconsumer spending has continued to advance. And on the whole, holiday spending came\nin stronger than many feared in the immediate aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\nI would argue that this episode illustrates quite well how consumption expenditures are\ngoverned predominantly by households’ assessment of their own future income\nprospects, rather than by any general economic nervousness, despite how they respond to\ntelephone pollsters. With healthy income growth ahead and a reasonably strong overall\njob market, the outlook for consumer spending looks good.\n\n\fHousing market activity has been very strong over the last several years, and the\nhistorically low level of inflation-adjusted mortgage interest rates explains much of that\nstrength. The fall in interest rates that began early in 2001 stimulated spending in interestsensitive sectors like housing and durable goods and partially offset the then-emerging\nweakness in business investment spending. As the latter has recovered in the last two\nyears, and real interest rates have had to rise as a consequence, a gradual “handoff” from\nhousing investment has been expected.\nThat handoff has yet to occur; the ratio of business to residential investment outlays fell\nfrom around 2.75 in 2000 to about 1.75 last year, and has been fairly constant since then.\nInstead, the combination of low inflation-adjusted interest rates and sustained real income\ngains have continued to provide a strong stimulus to housing demand.\nIn recent months, we have received widespread anecdotal reports of what one informant\nof ours called “a return to normalcy” in several housing markets in our District. The\nmultiple first-day bids and final sales at above-asking prices that were observed in some\nmarkets seem to have become less common. And in some markets, the amount of time a\nhome stays on the market has returned to more typical levels.\nAt the same time, the aggregate measures of housing activity have so far shown only\nlimited pull-back from their peaks and remain at historically high levels. The fact that\nhousing market activity typically declines in the last few months of each year is making it\ndifficult to collate quantitative and qualitative evidence and assess seasonally adjusted\nhousing market trends. Still, mortgage rates are likely to stay somewhat above their\nrecent lows in the coming year, so I would expect housing price appreciation to flatten\nout next year and aggregate residential investment to stop growing or perhaps even\ndecline.\nThe fundamentals for business investment in equipment and software look quite sound.\nBusiness output is expanding steadily and real funding costs are relatively low, both\nbecause inflation-adjusted, risk-free rates have been low and because corporate risk\nspreads are relatively narrow.\nEvidently, there has been a sufficient flow of opportunities to deploy new capital\nprofitably. Business investment in equipment and software has grown at over 11 percent\nin real terms since the first quarter of 2003, and it appears poised to grow at rates almost\nthat strong next year. Capital formation, particularly investment in information and\ncommunications technology (ICT), played an instrumental role in the widely noted surge\nin productivity growth that took place in the late 1990s. The fundamental driving force\nwas the sustained and rapid fall in the relative prices of these technologies.\nAlthough initial productivity growth figures for that period were revised downward in\nsubsequent data releases, our best estimates now are that productivity accelerated\nsignificantly in the mid-1990s from the relatively stagnant pace of 1.5 percent seen over\nthe previous 20 years to 2.6 percent over the second half of the 1990s.\n\n2\n\n\fProductivity has grown at surprisingly strong rates since then – 3.4 percent since the end\nof 2000 – despite significantly lower rates of capital formation. Productivity growth in\nthe first half of this decade thus must be mainly attributable to gains in what economists\ncall “total factor productivity” – that is, output growth in excess of all input growth\nthrough reorganization of the use of those inputs. At the risk of oversimplification, one\ncould say that firms increased productivity in the 1990s by providing workers with better\ntechnology, but in this decade by restructuring business processes to better exploit the\ntechnology they had.\nOne interpretation of these two episodes is that ICT investment outlays yield both an\ninitial productivity gain (which our standard methods attribute to capital deepening) and\nthen further productivity gains down the road as business processes are steadily\noptimized for the new infrastructure.\nOne implication of this perspective on recent productivity trends is that the current\nexpansion in business investment is laying a foundation for future growth in total factor\nproductivity, and thus provides at least some grounds for optimism that productivity\ngrowth might come in at 2.5 percent or higher, rather than the long-run trend rate of 2.25\npercent.\nUnfortunately, empirical evidence on this is limited, and as always, forecasting\nproductivity growth should be done with humility, given economists’ notably poor track\nrecord in this area.\nGains in labor productivity, whether due to capital deepening or improved business\nprocesses, ultimately pass through to real incomes. As a result, total real personal income\nhas grown recently: over 2 percent per year since the rebound in employment in mid2003, despite significant energy price increases. If productivity growth continues at or\nabove trend, as seems likely, then we should see healthy growth in real income next year,\nanticipation of which should continue to support consumption growth in 2006.\nLabor markets have recovered from the recession of 2001. Although employment was\nstagnant for a time following the downturn, hiring picked up in 2003. Of course,\nHurricane Katrina disrupted labor markets by forcing the displacement of close to a\nmillion people from the Gulf Coast region. That separated a substantial number of\nworkers from their employers, and damaged a substantial portion of the capital stock in\nthe affected areas. As a result, U.S. employment growth was noticeably depressed in\nSeptember and October, although quantitative estimates of the storms’ effects are\nimprecise.\nPayroll expansion has averaged over 200,000 jobs per month since October, however,\nmore than enough to keep up with the growth in working-age population.\nThe overall outlook therefore is for a healthy expansion next year. Real GDP should\ngrow at about 3.5 percent. Household spending should grow at about the same rate in real\nterms. Business investment should expand substantially faster than overall output and\n\n3\n\n\fresidential investment should expand more slowly, perhaps even falling in real terms.\nAnd I expect employment to track the growth in the working-age population in 2006.\nThis is a fairly balanced picture, but naturally there is some uncertainty attached to it.\nEconomic fundamentals could depart from their anticipated trajectories in any number of\nways that could leave a mark on U.S. economic aggregates.\nFor example, spot oil prices – or other commodity prices for that matter – could well turn\nout either above or below the path embodied in futures prices. Many global commodity\nmarkets have been affected by the unanticipated surge in worldwide demand over the last\nseveral of years; those for which supply elasticities are low have experienced significant\nprice run-ups. Commodity price surprises in either direction could alter aggregate supply\nconditions and either add or subtract from output growth.\nOn the demand side, there is some uncertainty regarding the rate at which housing\nactivity is at all likely to cool in the coming year. Although I do not think that a sharp fall\nin housing investment is likely, a range of forecasts from flat to moderately declining\nseem reasonable.\nAnd while continued growth in the share of output devoted to business investment seems\nhighly probable, it is difficult to foresee with any certainty the scale of investment that\nbusinesses will find profitable to undertake, so spending growth in this category could\nwell deviate from expectations.\nIn contrast, growth in household spending is easier to forecast, because both economic\ntheory and empirical evidence indicate that consumption growth is tied closely to income\ngrowth over time. The range of likely outcomes for real consumption growth is\ncorrespondingly more narrow.\nDifferences between how economic fundamentals are expected to unfold and how they\nactually unfold can have important implications for real interest rates and thus for\nmonetary policy.\nAs I have emphasized elsewhere, a real interest rate is a relative price – the price of\ncurrent resources relative to the future resources one either forgoes by borrowing or\nobtains by investing. Real interest rates need to respond to changes in the relative\npressure on current versus future resources.\nUnpredicted movements in economic fundamentals, to the extent that they affect the\nrelative pressure on current and future resources, thus will have implications for policy\nrates, even in situations in which inflation and inflation expectations are low and wellcontained.\nCore inflation has been low and relatively steady in the last several years. The inflation\nmeasure that is widely preferred on methodological grounds, the price index for core\npersonal consumption expenditures, has averaged 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending\n\n4\n\n\fin November. That is within the 1-to-2 percent range that I and others have proposed as\nan announced target.\nEven before Katrina, overall inflation, including food and energy prices, was elevated\ndue to the run-up in energy prices in the spring and summer. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita\nseverely disrupted energy production in the Gulf and led to sharp increases in refining\nmargins and prices for gasoline and natural gas. U.S. natural gas production and\npetroleum refining are still down 5 percent since Katrina, and crude oil production is\ndown 10 percent.\nImmediately following Hurricane Katrina, as the magnitude of the effects on Gulf Coast\nenergy production became clear, many observers came to fear that the resulting sharp\nincrease in energy prices might lead to a broader increase in inflation, and perhaps even\nrecessionary forces. These observers appeared to be reasoning by analogy to the 1970s,\nbut I believe that analogy is seriously mistaken.\nInflation expectations were unanchored in the 1970s, the credibility of the Federal\nReserve was low, and people expected the Fed to allow energy price shocks to feed\nthrough to overall inflation. The Fed often accommodated that expectation by preventing\nshort-term real interest rates from rising. In fact, at times we kept nominal rates from\nrising as fast as inflation and thus provided further monetary stimulus. The Fed was then\nforced to raise rates dramatically to bring inflation back down, and in the process induced\nan economic contraction, exacerbating the real effects of the oil price shocks.\nThus, the proper lesson from the 1970s is not that energy price shocks induce major\nrecessions or cause widespread inflation; it is that monetary policy that reacts to energy\nprice shocks by accommodating the rise in inflation can induce major recessions.\nMonetary policy should to respond to energy shocks by remaining focused on price\nstability. That way, the economy can respond to energy price shocks the way it should –\nthe relative price of energy increases, but core inflation remains anchored. In the\nimmediate aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, monetary policymakers naturally\nhave focused on the risk that the attendant energy price increases would “pass through” to\nan acceleration in core inflation. While the lack of an upsurge in the core PCE inflation\nfigures since September is somewhat encouraging, I think it is too soon to declare that\n“pass-through risk” is entirely behind us. This assessment is consistent with the statement\nreleased by the FOMC following its December meeting, which noted that, “…elevated\nenergy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.”\nTo my mind, any energy price pass-through to core inflation that is more than\nmarginal and transitory would be unwelcome.\nThus far, market participants appear to believe that core inflation will remain contained.\nSurvey measures of expected inflation rose sharply in September when retail gasoline\nprices reached their peak, but have come back down since. Measures of expected\n\n5\n\n\finflation derived from market prices of inflation protected U.S. Treasury securities drifted\nup a bit this fall, but they too have returned to mid-summer levels.\nTo maintain credibility for price stability, it is essential that monetary policy should\nrespond vigorously to any visible erosion in inflation expectations.\nMany of you may have noticed that in the statement released following the last FOMC\nmeeting, the term “accommodation” was dropped, or, in the words of one of my\ncolleagues, “given an honorable discharge.” Many observers are taking this as a sign that\nthe Committee may be coming close to completing the current sequence of tightening\nmoves that began in June of 2004.\nI discussed earlier that in an era of low and stable inflation, real interest rate movements\nwill predominantly reflect the relative pressure on current versus future resources.\nRecessions, in modern industrialized economies, are associated with transitory declines in\nthe demand for current goods and services. Since demand ultimately will recover, real\ninterest rates need to fall in recessions to reflect the abundance of current relative to\nfuture resources. Thus, the FOMC engineered a reduction in real interest rates in 2001\nthat lasted until mid-2004, when a steady recovery in demand became evident. Since\nthen, the economy has been on a transitional trajectory toward a path characterized by\nsustained and balanced expansion with relatively full utilization of resources. Along this\ntransition, real interest rates have been rising toward a range consistent with the sustained\ngrowth path to which the economy has been headed.\nIt deserves emphasis, however, that sustained growth is not likely to be perfectly smooth\nand predictable. Unpredicted variations in economic fundamentals can and will affect\neconomic conditions, even if they are not so large as to induce a recessionary break in\ngrowth.\nAnd as I emphasized earlier, if those variations have implications for the relative pressure\non current versus future resources, they will have implications for real interest rates as\nwell. The long expansions of the 1980s and 1990s were both cases in which interest rates\nfluctuated as the economy experienced sustained growth.\nThus, whenever the current sequence of tightening moves reaches completion, short-term\ninterest rates should not be expected to remain constant for an extended period of time.\nInstead, they will likely move from time to time during the expansion ahead.\nPolicymakers will need to be alert for movements in economic fundamentals that shift the\nrelative pressure on current versus future resources in ways that require changes in real\ninterest rates, even if inflation pressures subside.\n\n6\n\n\f",

            "content": "The Economic Outlook\nTowson University Economic Outlook Conference 2006\nTowson, Maryland\nJanuary 18, 2006\nJeffrey M. Lacker\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the economic outlook for 2006 and\nbeyond. It is a pleasure, in part, because the economic outlook is fairly encouraging.\nGrowth is on a solid footing, despite this year’s run-up in energy prices and the\ndisruptions of a devastating hurricane season. And after a brief pause this fall,\nemployment is expanding again at a healthy pace, consumer spending continues to grow\nbriskly, and business investment spending is robust. Granted, housing activity seems to\nbe softening, and at least some potential price level pressures remain, so it may be too\nsoon to break out the champagne. But inflation expectations remain contained, and we at\nthe Fed are well-positioned to resist inflation pressures, should they emerge.\nSo all in all, it is quite a good outlook.\nIn my remarks today, I would like to review the economic outlook in a bit more detail,\nand then talk about monetary policy. As always, my remarks reflect my own views, and\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\nThe really striking feature of the current outlook is the extent to which economic activity\nin general and consumer spending in particular has rebounded from the shock of last\nyear’s hurricane season. In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, fears were\nwidespread that consumers might pull back sharply on spending, both in response to\nsharply higher retail gasoline prices and out of a general sense of heightened anxiety\nabout potential fallout from the storm damage.\nSurvey measures of consumer confidence, which plummeted in September, seemed to\nbolster this view. But the effect of the storms on consumer outlays have turned out to be\nfar more limited than expected, exemplifying the oft-cited resilience of the U.S.\neconomy. Apart from auto sales, which slid following expiration of the summer’s\n“employee discount” promotions, retail sales have held up fairly well and overall\nconsumer spending has continued to advance. And on the whole, holiday spending came\nin stronger than many feared in the immediate aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\nI would argue that this episode illustrates quite well how consumption expenditures are\ngoverned predominantly by households’ assessment of their own future income\nprospects, rather than by any general economic nervousness, despite how they respond to\ntelephone pollsters. With healthy income growth ahead and a reasonably strong overall\njob market, the outlook for consumer spending looks good.\n\n1\n\n\fHousing market activity has been very strong over the last several years, and the\nhistorically low level of inflation-adjusted mortgage interest rates explains much of that\nstrength. The fall in interest rates that began early in 2001 stimulated spending in interestsensitive sectors like housing and durable goods and partially offset the then-emerging\nweakness in business investment spending. As the latter has recovered in the last two\nyears, and real interest rates have had to rise as a consequence, a gradual “handoff” from\nhousing investment has been expected.\nThat handoff has yet to occur; the ratio of business to residential investment outlays fell\nfrom around 2.75 in 2000 to about 1.75 last year, and has been fairly constant since then.\nInstead, the combination of low inflation-adjusted interest rates and sustained real income\ngains have continued to provide a strong stimulus to housing demand.\nIn recent months, we have received widespread anecdotal reports of what one informant\nof ours called “a return to normalcy” in several housing markets in our District. The\nmultiple first-day bids and final sales at above-asking prices that were observed in some\nmarkets seem to have become less common. And in some markets, the amount of time a\nhome stays on the market has returned to more typical levels.\nAt the same time, the aggregate measures of housing activity have so far shown only\nlimited pull-back from their peaks and remain at historically high levels. The fact that\nhousing market activity typically declines in the last few months of each year is making it\ndifficult to collate quantitative and qualitative evidence and assess seasonally adjusted\nhousing market trends. Still, mortgage rates are likely to stay somewhat above their\nrecent lows in the coming year, so I would expect housing price appreciation to flatten\nout next year and aggregate residential investment to stop growing or perhaps even\ndecline.\nThe fundamentals for business investment in equipment and software look quite sound.\nBusiness output is expanding steadily and real funding costs are relatively low, both\nbecause inflation-adjusted, risk-free rates have been low and because corporate risk\nspreads are relatively narrow.\nEvidently, there has been a sufficient flow of opportunities to deploy new capital\nprofitably. Business investment in equipment and software has grown at over 11 percent\nin real terms since the first quarter of 2003, and it appears poised to grow at rates almost\nthat strong next year. Capital formation, particularly investment in information and\ncommunications technology (ICT), played an instrumental role in the widely noted surge\nin productivity growth that took place in the late 1990s. The fundamental driving force\nwas the sustained and rapid fall in the relative prices of these technologies.\nAlthough initial productivity growth figures for that period were revised downward in\nsubsequent data releases, our best estimates now are that productivity accelerated\nsignificantly in the mid-1990s from the relatively stagnant pace of 1.5 percent seen over\nthe previous 20 years to 2.6 percent over the second half of the 1990s.\n\n2\n\n\fProductivity has grown at surprisingly strong rates since then — 3.4 percent since the end\nof 2000 — despite significantly lower rates of capital formation. Productivity growth in\nthe first half of this decade thus must be mainly attributable to gains in what economists\ncall “total factor productivity” — that is, output growth in excess of all input growth\nthrough reorganization of the use of those inputs. At the risk of oversimplification, one\ncould say that firms increased productivity in the 1990s by providing workers with better\ntechnology, but in this decade by restructuring business processes to better exploit the\ntechnology they had.\nOne interpretation of these two episodes is that ICT investment outlays yield both an\ninitial productivity gain (which our standard methods attribute to capital deepening) and\nthen further productivity gains down the road as business processes are steadily\noptimized for the new infrastructure.\nOne implication of this perspective on recent productivity trends is that the current\nexpansion in business investment is laying a foundation for future growth in total factor\nproductivity, and thus provides at least some grounds for optimism that productivity\ngrowth might come in at 2.5 percent or higher, rather than the long-run trend rate of 2.25\npercent.\nUnfortunately, empirical evidence on this is limited, and as always, forecasting\nproductivity growth should be done with humility, given economists’ notably poor track\nrecord in this area.\nGains in labor productivity, whether due to capital deepening or improved business\nprocesses, ultimately pass through to real incomes. As a result, total real personal income\nhas grown recently: over 2 percent per year since the rebound in employment in mid2003, despite significant energy price increases. If productivity growth continues at or\nabove trend, as seems likely, then we should see healthy growth in real income next year,\nanticipation of which should continue to support consumption growth in 2006.\nLabor markets have recovered from the recession of 2001. Although employment was\nstagnant for a time following the downturn, hiring picked up in 2003. Of course,\nHurricane Katrina disrupted labor markets by forcing the displacement of close to a\nmillion people from the Gulf Coast region.
