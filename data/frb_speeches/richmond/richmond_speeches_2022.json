First, COVID-19 still impacts our growth, but it has\nlargely become a supply side and in�ationary challenge. Second, government\nsupport helped bridge our economy through the initial shock, but we may also be\nseeing other e�ects. Third, our supply chains were too lean to support the wide\nswings in demand. Fourth, power has shifted to labor as demand has exceeded\nsupply. Finally, the word transitory did not serve its intended purpose, as in�ation\nhas lasted longer than many expected.\n• These lessons help shape my outlook for 2022. While there are many unknowns\nahead, I expect increases in household balance sheets to sustain demand for quite\nsome time. It may take a year or longer to get to the other side of supply chain\npressures, but they will eventually catch up. Labor will remain short. Prices will cause\nconsumers to adjust as savings erode, and wages will bring people o� the sidelines.\n• But what will happen to the path for in�ation? I am closely watching the prices for\ngoods versus services. Will they continue on their historic paths or will present\nadjustments persist? How these two sectors net out will matter as the Fed continues\nto work to meet its stable price mandate.\n• In terms of policy, we have started the process of normalization, but the timing and\npace of any future rate moves will depend on the answer to my question on\nin�ation.\n\nThanks for having me here. The last time I was with you in person was two years ago. At the\ntime, the question was how long our historically long 10-year upturn could last. I remember\nsaying that expansions don’t die of old age — they die of a heart attack. I guess my point\n\n\fwas right, but for sure I had the wrong disease.\nIt’s hard to believe we’ve now been dealing with this pandemic for two years. From an\neconomist’s point of view, we had the deepest but also the shortest recession in memory.\nSo now, technically, we are in the midst of a 20-month recovery. And not just any recovery.\nThis one is historic.\nToday, I thought I might look back and then look forward. We’ve learned a lot that will help\ninform where the economy goes from here. These thoughts represent, of course, my views\nonly and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. So, what did\nwe learn in 2021? I took �ve lessons.\n\nIn 2020, the pandemic drove uncertainty and lockdowns, which in turn meant job loss and\nspending that was depressed and de�ationary at �rst and then rotated to goods over\nservices. In 2021, vaccines largely freed demand from COVID-19’s control (except for a few\nsectors like business travel). Despite the delta variant, consumer spending more than fully\nrecovered, and we saw the highest number of job openings on record.\nBut the COVID-19 economic threat — much like the virus — has evolved. You can see that\nwith the omicron variant. Cases have spiked. But, as the virus starts to become perceived as\nmore endemic than pandemic, U.S. communities are no longer closing down. Demand,\nespecially for goods, remains healthy. But uncertainty around health, child care and inperson schooling suppresses labor force participation. Outbreaks internationally disrupt\nglobal supply chains. So COVID-19 has now largely become a supply side and in�ationary\nchallenge. We saw that with air travel over the holidays. People want to �y. We just can’t\n�nd enough �ight crews.\n\nHistoric levels of government support helped bridge workers, small businesses, and heavily\nimpacted industries to the other side of the initial economic shock. It fueled this strong\nrecovery. GDP is now 1.4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2019 and will likely soon even\nsurpass the pre-COVID-19 trend line.\nBut these actions had consequences. Stimulus created strong demand, especially for\ngoods, which are up 16 percent. That demand broke supply chains. Workers were slow to\nreturn to the labor force, perhaps supported by these transfer payments. And of course,\nwe’ve seen a considerable increase in the national debt.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, productivity meant lean operations, global supply chains, just-intime inventories and �exible labor models.\nCOVID-19 exposed those strategies. As demand ebbed then spiked, manufacturers lost\ncontrol. Input shortages, transportation challenges and labor constraints proliferated. We\n\n\fall understood when auto manufacturers shut down in the context of lockdowns, but who\nexpected they would have to shut down again last year due to a lack of chips?\n\nWe’ve been living for decades in a world of excess workers, driven by the baby boom,\nimproved health, women in the workforce, immigration and o�shoring. These kept wages\nand bene�ts, and e�ectively cost-driven in�ation, down.\nBut in 2021, the tables turned. Labor is now painfully short. Workforce participation has\nstayed remarkably stagnant since the spring at around 1.5 percentage points below the\npre-pandemic level. 3.6 million fewer people are working. We see fewer retirees returning\nto work, more parents leaving the workforce and countless workers reassessing their lives.\nQuits are at record highs. As a result, employers are raising wages, improving working\nconditions, broadening their search e�orts and becoming more �exible. 2021 saw the\nhighest wage growth since before the Great Recession, peaking at 4.7 percent in\nSeptember, according to the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker.\n\nFor much of 2021, we used the word “transitory” to describe in�ation. It tried to capture the\nidea that rising prices were connected to COVID-19 forces that should eventually dissipate,\nsuch as supply bottlenecks.\nBut as the chair said in his recent testimony, the word didn’t serve its purpose. Webster’s\nhas two de�nitions for transitory: “of brief duration” and “not persistent.” Most of us\ninterpreted it as the former, even if we meant the latter. And elevated in�ation has clearly\nlasted longer than most of us expected. On a 12-month basis, core PCE in�ation is at the\nhighest level in over 30 years.\n\nI feel obliged to start with a caveat: Forecasting isn’t easy. I’m told economic forecasters\nwere created to make weather forecasters look good. For example, in the summer of 2021,\nI thought participation would rebound strongly in the fall as schools reopened and\nenhanced unemployment bene�ts ceased. I didn’t foresee the longer-term workforce\nchallenges we face. As a result, I underestimated in�ation.\nAnd 2022 is no clearer. The path and impact of current and future COVID-19 variants is\nunknown. Congress is still debating legislation that may or may not enhance workforce\nparticipation. Consumer sentiment is weak at a time when consumer spending is strong.\nThe yield curve has been sending signals that are hard to interpret. The noise on in�ation is\nelevated, yet market indicators of in�ation compensation appear largely una�ected.\n\n\fHousehold balance sheets are �ush. Household net worth was $32 trillion higher in the\nthird quarter of 2021 than in the same period in 2019 (up 28 percent). This was driven, of\ncourse, by investment and real estate appreciation. Pandemic lifestyle changes combined\nwith government transfers created excess savings and made households more liquid as\nwell. In September, low-income families had 70 percent more cash on hand than prepandemic (albeit only $1,000), and high-income families had about 40 percent more,\naccording to JPMorgan Chase. Recent data shows those savings are starting to be spent\ndown.\nIn addition, businesses are reporting record pro�ts and strong balance sheets. Inventories\nare low and will need to be replenished. States are seeing sizable surpluses. All these will\nsustain demand for quite some time.\n\nI’m hoping to see some progress in the �rst quarter. Seasonal demand reductions should\ngive manufacturers breathing room, and some sectors will be digesting the impact of\nstockpiling last fall. But Omicron is of course a wild card here.\nAnd it will take a year or longer to get fully to the other side. Constrained labor will continue\nto hinder supply. Capacity building takes business con�dence and time. The median\nrespondent in The CFO Survey forecasts that supply constraints should last another 10-12\nmonths.\n\nThe trends have been clear for a while: Fertility is down, immigration has slowed and our\nworkforce is aging. In the last upturn, participation didn’t drop as much as predicted. But\nthe pandemic has introduced even more forces, such as unstable child and elder care and\nan expansion of the social safety net.\nWhat we may �nd is that the aberration isn’t what we see today but what we saw in the last\nupturn. Labor will likely struggle to meet coming demand. Companies are trading one\nanother’s workers, and this auction will continue until employers reduce their need for\nworkers through automation or other productivity investments. Those will take time.\n\nFor the most part, we are not seeing price levels a�ect quantity demanded the way you\nmight imagine. Retailers have prioritized availability over price. Employers are paying higher\nwages without reducing jobs. Consumers, fueled by strong savings and higher wages,\nhaven’t yet chosen to begin trading down. Labor force participation isn’t moving.\nBut price levels will eventually have an impact. Walmart merchandisers won’t abandon\neveryday low prices. Consumer savings will erode, driving them to price shop. Employers\nwill pursue lower labor strategies. Higher wages will eventually bring people o� the\nsidelines.\n\n\fOnce current in�ation pressures ease, will we return to the 1.9 percent core PCE in�ation of\nthe last 30 years? The 3.0 percent of the past two years? Or the 5.3 percent annualized\nin�ation of the last nine months? Are memories short or long?\nGiven my view on 2022, the data I’m tracking most closely are the prices for goods versus\nservices. For perspective, taking 24-month di�erences to avoid pandemic base e�ects,\nannualized CPI services in�ation has been 2.8 percent, roughly in line with the prior �ve\nyears. In contrast, annualized goods in�ation has been 6.3 percent, signi�cantly higher than\nthe prior �ve-year drop of -0.2 percent per year.\nAs supply chain pressures wane, I expect goods in�ation to reduce. But will the factors that\nhave kept goods prices in line historically (like e-commerce, retailer purchasing power, and\nglobalization) continue to have the same e�ect or not? Will supply chain redesign push\ncosts and prices up instead?\nAnd as labor shortages continue, I expect them to pressure the price of services, where\nwages are a more meaningful share of costs. But how much can and will be passed on to\ncustomers?\nHow these two sectors net out will matter as the Fed continues to work to meet its stable\nprice mandate.\nWhich brings us to policy. With the labor market tight and in�ation elevated, we have\nstarted the process of normalization. We started tapering asset purchases in November\nand then accelerated that process at our last meeting in December. At current pace, we will\nbe done in mid-March. At that time, we will be free to begin normalizing rates, should\ncircumstances support that. The timing and pace of any rate moves will depend on the\nanswer to my in�ation question. The closer that in�ation comes back to target levels, the\neasier it will be to normalize rates at a measured pace. But were in�ation to remain\nelevated and broad-based, we would need to take on normalization more aggressively, as\nwe have successfully done in the past.\nWith that said, I warned you forecasting is hard. So, I am interested in what you are seeing\nin the market and am open to your input and questions.\nThis is the change in seasonally adjusted total nonfarm employment from February 2020 to\nDecember 2021.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nInvesting in Rural America\n\nSince joining the Richmond Fed in 2018, I have visited small towns all across our District,\nfrom the coasts to the mountains. Some of these communities are thriving—perhaps\nthey’ve been able to capitalize on natural endowments, or they’ve partnered with\nneighboring towns, or they’ve found a creative source of funding. But other communities\nare struggling. They’ve lost employers, residents, or both; their infrastructure is in poor\nrepair; or they’re isolated, geographically and digitally, from necessities like banking or\nhealth care.\nAt the Richmond Fed, we’re committed to learning from the towns that are making it work\nso that we can help those that are facing challenges. That’s the goal of our third annual\nInvesting in Rural America conference, which brings together community leaders and local\n\n\fand national experts in rural development. This year’s event takes place on March 30 in\nGreensboro, N.C., and features a virtual attendance option as well. The conference is one of\nthe many ways—along with Rural America Week, our Community Conversations, and our\nongoing research—that we learn about and share promising strategies for improving\neconomic outcomes in smaller towns.\nWe’re in a unique moment. While COVID-19 continues to exacerbate the challenges many\ncommunities face, small towns also have unprecedented opportunities to invest in their\nfuture. Multiple pandemic relief bills, combined with the recent Infrastructure Investment\nand Jobs Act, have made billions of dollars available for investments in broadband,\ntransportation, health care, climate resilience, and more. But many towns don’t have the\nhuman or technical capacity they need to apply for grants or distribute funding, which is\nwhy building that capacity will be the subject of our afternoon plenary at the upcoming\nconference.\nPhysical infrastructure is crucial, but it’s not the only place we need to invest if we want\nsmaller communities to realize their potential. We must also invest in their workforce.\nCommunity colleges have a key role to play. They are the �rst college experience for many\nlow-income students. They provide the skills people need to land good jobs and can\nconnect students to employers, or they can help students prepare for a four-year degree.\nThey also o�er certi�cate programs that can deliver new skills in a relatively short period of\ntime. Unfortunately, community college enrollment has been declining slowly for years, and\nthe pandemic exacerbated these declines, especially for students of color. I fear that a\ngeneration of workers is passing on the opportunity to build their skills. So I’m looking\nforward to our conversation at the conference with community college leaders from our\nDistrict about how we can support these institutions and the people they serve.\nAnother key area for investment is early care and education. It’s well known that early\neducation is critical for children—and the pandemic has underscored how critical it is for\nparents, especially mothers, to be able to participate in the workforce. Even beyond\npandemic-related issues, child care centers face a challenging cost structure, which can\nmake them especially di�cult to open and operate in smaller towns. Nearly 60 percent of\nrural communities meet the de�nition of a “child care desert.” Adults in rural areas are\nmore likely to work during non-standard hours, which can make it hard to �nd care that\nmeets their needs. And even where child care is available, it’s often una�ordable for\nfamilies. That’s why strengthening our early care system will be the subject of another of\nour panels, with child care experts from throughout the region.\nWe’ll also address housing. High-quality housing that’s a�ordable for lower- and middleincome workers is in short supply in rural areas, for a variety of reasons. These include\nolder housing stock, less multifamily development, and the increasing cost of construction,\namong other factors. Communities end up stuck in a vicious cycle: People don’t move to\nrural areas because they can’t �nd housing, but developers don’t want to invest without\npotential buyers and renters. This in turn can in�uence employers’ location decisions,\n\n\fbecause they aren’t going to set up shop without a workforce to draw from. We’ll hear from\nrural leaders about how nonpro�ts, lenders and community organizations can lead to the\ndevelopment of quality, a�ordable housing for the rural workforce.\nFinally, we’ll talk about how we can support aspiring entrepreneurs and small business\nowners in rural areas. It’s true that most small businesses don’t grow into the next Google\nor Amazon—but it’s also true that a business doesn’t have to be one of these “unicorns” to\nbene�t a community.\nOverall, more sole proprietorships and small businesses in an area are associated with\nmore job growth and better overall economic health and resiliency. Prior to the pandemic,\nstartup rates had been declining for decades—but we’ve seen an encouraging burst of\nstartup activity recently. I’m optimistic that communities will be able to take advantage of\nthis moment to help build thriving entrepreneurial networks.\nWe hope you’ll be able to join us on March 30, either in person or online, for rich\ndiscussions about investing in our small towns—for their sake, and for the economic health\nof our country as a whole.\nCenter for American Progress, “America’s Child Care Deserts in 2018,” Dec. 6, 2018.\n\nSmall Town and Rural Communities\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nIn�ation has become the focus of conversation. But in its shadow — and partially pulling\nthe strings — is tightness in the labor market. Employers continue to struggle to bring in\nnew workers and keep existing ones. Job openings far outnumber individuals looking for\nwork. Absenteeism is elevated due to COVID-19. Jobs are still down by nearly three million.\nImmigration remains far below its pre-COVID-19 trend. As a result of this tightness, wages\nare up 4.5 percent, the highest year-over-year growth in over 20 years.\nDiscussion about this labor shortage has focused on demographics. We have written about\nthe surge in retirees and how child care challenges have pushed mothers out of the labor\nforce. But it is also useful to look at the dynamics by sector. I hear very di�erent stories in\nthree distinct segments of the economy: low-paying personal services, in-demand skilled\ntrades and remote-friendly professionals.\nThe low-paying personal services segment was heavily disrupted by the pandemic. In\naccommodation and food services, for example, employment fell by nearly 50 percent\nbetween February and April 2020, and the workforce is still 1.5 million short of prepandemic levels. This segment has seen the fastest wage growth and highest quits rates.\nWages for accommodation and food services, for example, grew 9.3 percent year-overyear. Their quits rate hit record highs.\nThis pressure doesn’t seem to be a demand issue, as revenue for many of these services\nremains short of pre-pandemic levels. The story here is labor supply. Workers have left the\nsegment — perhaps because it now seems less stable, perhaps because of concern about\nCOVID-19, perhaps because of working conditions (including the need to wear masks), or\nperhaps because of child care responsibilities.\nImportantly, these workers see better alternatives. Many have entered industries that grew\nduring the pandemic, such as transportation and warehousing (up more than 500,000\njobs). Others have taken advantage of a hot labor market to take entry-level positions now\no�ering much higher pay. Others are leveraging their excess savings to be choosier about\n\n\fwhen they rejoin the workforce.\nAs demand returns in this segment, employers are investing in higher wages, enhanced\nsearch e�orts, and productivity and automation initiatives to bring supply and demand\nback into balance. I suspect they will also need to think about working conditions that\nmatch the needs of those labor market segments who could be attracted from the\nsidelines, like students, parents and retirees. Topics like scheduling, child care, job design\nand screening criteria are being considered by innovative employers.\nThe issues in skilled trades (think nursing, trucking and manufacturing, for example) are\ndi�erent. These sectors typically require credentials or licenses and were already facing\ntight labor markets prior to the pandemic. Labor supply is quite inelastic in the short run,\nand these sectors have been unable to keep up with pandemic levels of demand.\nWages and quits in these industries aren’t as elevated as in low-paying services, but they\ntoo have escalated against their historic norms. Wages in manufacturing, for example, grew\n4.1 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021, nearly a percentage point higher\nthan the fastest growth the industry had seen in any quarter since the Great Recession. Its\nquits rate remains near the industry’s record high hit in September.\nThe story in many skilled trades is increased demand. Trucking and construction are\nbooming. And, despite supply chain challenges, industrial production in manufacturing has\nalready surpassed where it was pre-pandemic. Perhaps the growth in manufacturing and\ntrucking isn’t too surprising given that — at its recent peak — consumer spending on goods\nwas 20 percent higher than pre-pandemic. Labor demand re�ects that recovery. If\nmanufacturers could �ll every open position, they’d be 200,000 jobs above where they\nwould have been had they done the same in February 2020.\nSkilled trades have a pipeline problem, and it may be getting worse. Community colleges,\nwhich play a central role in preparing workers for these jobs, have seen enrollment decline\nover the past two years. The decline may well be explained by increased wages raising the\nopportunity cost of education, but it puts the economy further away from building the\nnecessary pipeline of workers for these sectors.\nEmployers and localities will need to take ownership of their education, training and\ncredentialing pipelines. Employers can provide their own training, or can partner with\ncommunity colleges to provide equipment, instructors and apprenticeship opportunities.\nStates can simplify their licensing requirements and debottleneck their credentialing\nprocesses. They can also work to expand the pipeline by providing more holistic funding to\nstudents pursuing noncredit programs.\nThe remote-friendly professional segment has seen less trauma. Layo�s were rarer in the\npandemic. Demand stayed robust. Work got done. Financial activities, information, and\nprofessional and technical services have all seen employment recover since February 2020,\nwith the latter adding more than half a million jobs.\nThis segment has also been tight, though perhaps somewhat less than its late ‘90s peak.\n\n\fFor example, the most elevated quits rates for information and �nancial activities during\nthe pandemic were still more than half a percentage point below their record high rates in\n2001.\nThe story here is what may be to come. Now that we are nearing the end of the pandemic,\nwe hear widespread stories of professionals reassessing their careers. Many are su�ering\nfrom burnout: workers experiencing “loyalty punishment” as their workloads increased\nwhen colleagues left. Employers will also need to navigate emerging mismatches, especially\non work preferences. During COVID-19, employee preferences evolved, on remote work\nand even on where they chose to live. As I’ve written, it’s not yet clear which model of work\nwill optimize business performance and talent retention. But, regardless, it is likely a\nnumber of workers will �nd themselves mismatched against their employer’s intended\noperating model and emboldened to explore alternatives by the strong labor market. So,\nwe may well see further pressure in this segment, requiring employers to change the\nnarrative to meet the needs of a workforce that has become more demanding.\nWhether it be a lack of supply, an abundance of demand, or a new set of worker demands,\nemployers feel the pressure and are now innovating to try to address the unique workforce\nissues that a�ect their particular industry. We are monitoring their e�orts closely, in hopes\nthat a return to balance will in turn reduce pressure on in�ation.\nWage data throughout this essay refers to the Employment Cost Index.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\n\fSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nMaryland Bankers Association\nFirst Friday Economic Outlook Forum\n\n• It’s time to begin to normalize rates. The worst of the pandemic is behind us, and we\nare 22 months into the fastest recovery in our memory.\n• The economy is no longer in need of aggressive Fed support. Instead, we need to put\nourselves in a position to contain in�ation. It’s our job to do so — the Fed’s mandate\nrequires us to promote stable prices.\n• Some worry that raising rates to control in�ation necessarily drives the economy into\na recession. And with the surge in energy prices since the Ukraine invasion, some\neven raise the topic of stag�ation — a word from the 70s. The rate path we\nannounced this week shouldn’t drive economic decline. We are still far from the level\nof rates that constrains the economy.\n• Prior to our meeting, there was much debate about whether the Fed should move\nfaster. We have moved at a 50-basis point clip in the past, and we certainly could do\nso again if we start to believe that is necessary to prevent in�ation expectations from\nunanchoring. But setting the right pace for rate increases is a balancing act — we\nnormalize rates to contain in�ation, but if we overcorrect, we can negatively impact\nemployment, which is the other part of our dual mandate.\n\nThanks for having me today. It’s great to be back in front of this group, and — while I regret\nthat we had to reschedule from January — the timing might actually be better, as the world\nhas gotten even more complicated, and the Fed has been in the news this week. So, today, I\nwant to talk about the economy, but particularly about the topic that put the Fed in the\nnews: interest rates. I caution these are my views alone and not necessarily those of any of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve\n\n\fSystem.\nYou all likely saw that at this week’s FOMC meeting, the Fed decided to raise interest rates\n25 basis points. In our statement, we said that we anticipate that “ongoing increases in the\ntarget range will be appropriate” in order to return in�ation to our 2 percent objective. The\nmedian member of the FOMC forecasted 7 rate hikes this year and 3-4 next year, moving\nrates modestly over most estimates of the neutral rate. In his press conference, the chair\nsaid we would start to reduce the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting, and that\ncould be as early as May.\nIt’s time to begin to normalize rates. The worst of the pandemic is behind us, and we are 22\nmonths into the fastest recovery in our memory. By the end of this quarter, GDP will likely\nexceed not only its pre-pandemic level, but perhaps also its pre-pandemic trend line.\nConsumer spending is strong, business investment is healthy and the housing market is\nhot. Underlying demand looks to remain robust, fueled by healthy business and personal\nbalance sheets, the need to replenish low inventories and state governments that are �ush\nwith cash. We may see more variants — possibly the one rising today in Western Europe —\nbut we are learning to live with COVID-19.\nWe now are facing a di�erent challenge: in�ation. As demand for goods exploded in the\nmidst of the pandemic, supply chains struggled to keep up. Labor markets also became\nquite tight. Unemployment has dropped to 3.8 percent. In addition, the pool of those\nlooking for a job has shrunk: Two million fewer workers are in the workforce, and\nimmigration remains well below its pre-COVID-19 trend. Consequently, wages are up:\nAverage hourly earnings have risen 5.1 percent. And price in�ation is elevated, with core\nPCE at 5.2 percent — the highest since April 1983. At �rst, these conditions seemed\ntemporary, but they have persisted and broadened — making in�ation the headline of the\nday and causing more and more �rms to consider raising their own prices.\nAll of this means the economy is no longer in need of aggressive Fed support. Instead, we\nneed to put ourselves in a position to contain in�ation. It’s our job to do so — the Fed’s\nmandate requires us to promote stable prices.\nYou might ask how raising rates contains in�ation. The answer varies over di�erent time\nhorizons.\nShort-term changes in in�ation tend to be driven by factors outside of the Fed’s control.\nThink about the aftermath of a hurricane. Lumber prices increase temporarily as demand\nspikes for materials to make necessary repairs. An interest rate move wouldn’t a�ect that\ndynamic. Nor should it try to: These price movements should reverse themselves with no\nassistance from us. Well, we are still working through the destructive impact caused by the\npandemic and now geopolitics. In�ation continues to be impacted by supply chain\nshortages, low labor force participation and the ebb and �ow of the virus — most recently\ncausing lockdowns in Shenzhen, China. And Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has a�ected prices\nof commodities like energy, aluminum, wheat and nickel.\n\n\fIn the medium and long term, on the other hand, the Fed’s rate moves certainly do\nin�uence in�ation. Milton Friedman’s famous analysis showed that monetary policy\noperates with a lag, which he called “long and variable.”\nOne part of how we in�uence in�ation is quite tangible. Against a backdrop of stable\nin�ation expectations, we raise rates and that reduces demand and eventually prices.\nDeposit rates increase, thereby creating more incentive to save rather than spend. The\ndollar appreciates, lessening demand for exports and lowering the price of imports.\nBorrowing rates rise, reducing capital investment and consumer spending. That’s\nparticularly true in interest-sensitive sectors like housing, auto and consumer durables. You\nare already seeing mortgage rates go up, for example.\nAnother part is less tangible and occurs through a psychological e�ect over the longer\nterm. Individuals and �rms build expectations about future in�ation. Firms then make their\npricing and compensation decisions — and individuals make their purchase and\nemployment decisions — in the context of those expectations. If the Fed does its part to\ncontrol in�ation, expectations and price and wage increases stay stable and anchored. If\nnot, they don’t, as you might argue has been happening in Turkey.\nHappily, so far, U.S. expectations seem to have stayed stable. Long-term market measures\nof in�ation compensation, derived from the TIPS indices, remain in line with our 2 percent\ntarget despite short-term in�ation and in�ation expectations at multidecade highs.\nSimilarly, the Michigan Survey of 5-10-year in�ation expectations has only increased\nmodestly. Both are at levels comparable to 2013 and 2014.\nSome worry that raising rates to control in�ation necessarily drives the economy into a\nrecession. And with the surge in energy prices since the Ukraine invasion, some even raise\nthe foottopic of stag�ation — a word from the 70s. The rate path we announced this week\nshouldn’t drive economic decline. We are still far from the level of rates that constrains the\neconomy; for my colleagues on the FOMC, this would be somewhere above their long-term\nprojections for the neutral rate, which ranges from 2-3 percent. This week’s move still\nleaves us a good 9-10 rate increases away from that point. So, instead of thinking about the\nupcoming cycle of rate increases as foreshadowing a coming recession, think of it as an\nindication that the extraordinary support of the pandemic era is unwinding. We are\nreducing that support gradually so that we can get back to a more normal position as the\neconomic situation evolves. At that time, we can decide if we need to put the brakes on the\neconomy or not.\nPrior to our meeting, there was much debate about whether the Fed should move faster.\nWe have moved at a 50-basis point clip in the past, and we certainly could do so again if we\nstart to believe that is necessary to prevent in�ation expectations from unanchoring. But\nsetting the right pace for rate increases is a balancing act — we normalize rates to contain\nin�ation, but if we overcorrect, we can negatively impact employment, which is the other\npart of our dual mandate. And we have some time to get to a neutral position. In�ation and\nemployment are still being heavily in�uenced by pandemic-era supply and participation\n\n\fpressures — and more recently, the war on Ukraine — and it will take a while for us to\nunderstand and meet the dynamics of the post-pandemic economy.\nBen Bernanke once said that monetary policy is a collaborative endeavor: Clear\ncommunication and steady movement guide markets in ways that reinforce our messaging.\nIn contrast, market surprises sometimes lead to tightened �nancial conditions that can\ncause the real economy to pull back more than we intend. So, it’s worth noting that the\nbond market seems to already be taking our direction. As we have signaled a rate change\nover the last few months, market rates have moved signi�cantly. The two-year treasury\nyield has gone from 0.28 in September (as of Sept. 30 close) to 1.95 (as of March 16 close)\ntoday. The �ve-year has moved from 0.98 (as of Sept. 30 close) to 2.18 (as of March 16\nclose). So, while we could move faster, we are already having more impact than you might\nthink.\nWhile the proven and more important tool is rates, our balance sheet moves can work in\nthe background to reinforce this rate path. As a reminder, we began purchasing treasuries\nand mortgage-backed securities to stabilize �nancial markets in March 2020, and then\ncontinued them to support the economy through the pandemic. Our balance sheet is now\nabout 9 trillion in assets, up from 4.2 trillion pre-pandemic. As we start to normalize rates, it\nis appropriate to start to normalize the balance sheet as well, and we will begin to do that\nsoon. There is a reasonable amount of debate in the literature and in the �nancial markets\nabout the impact of balance sheet reduction. For me, it’s pretty simple: Our purchases\nreduced rates in a modest fashion; our reductions should have a symmetric e�ect and\nincrease medium-term rates modestly, thereby supporting our desired rate trajectory.\nTo close, I want to talk about what I’ll be keeping an eye on in the coming months: demand,\nsupply and pricing. While I think all three of these areas should normalize, there are still\nunanswered questions. Demand should calm as rates increase, excess savings are spent,\nand we work through the current oil price shocks, but how much, how quickly, and in what\nmix of goods and services? Supply should recover as COVID-19 recedes, supply chains are\nremediated and workers rejoin the workforce. But how long will this take, and how much\nupside does the labor force have? And in�ation should move toward target as pandemic\nand geopolitical pressures ease and policy normalizes. But how fast will that happen, and\nwhat will be the impact of this period on in�ation expectations? These answers will dictate\nthe pace with which we use our tools; put another way, they will provide us with ongoing\nfeedback about how to adjust policy in order to keep in�ation expectations anchored and\nkeep in�ation on a medium-term path back to our 2 percent target.\nI hope this was a useful way for you to understand how to think about policy and how we\nuse our tools — and now I am open to questions.\nThis re�ects the di�erence in total nonfarm payroll employment between February 2020 and\nFebruary 2022.

And\neverywhere — across every issue — I hear one critical need that constrains how\nmuch change a community can make: money.\n• Multiple rounds of federal stimulus means that billions of dollars are being made\navailable for small towns across the country, on top of those available through\nprivate grant-makers.\n• This is a game-changing amount of money. But wherever I go, local leaders say it will\nbe very di�cult to access. Why is that? I hear three key barriers. First, grants are\ncomplicated. Second, they often require organizations to raise money. Third, there’s\na bias towards experience.\n• Communities need help building their capacity, and they need it now. They need help\n�nding and training leadership. They need help writing grant applications that meet\nfunder speci�cations. They need help acquiring match funding. They need help\ndistributing and administering funds e�ectively. And they need help assessing\nimpact.\n\nThanks for joining us today. This the fourth time we have brought rural practitioners\ntogether and our third attempt to do so in North Carolina. I’m so pleased that COVID-19 has\n�nally decided to cooperate. On the bright side, the pandemic taught us virtual could work\nand massively extend our reach. So, welcome to all of you joining us online.\nAt the Richmond Fed, we are committed to understanding the unique challenges faced by\nthe many small towns across our district. The data is clear. On average, small towns have\n\n\flower employment rates, less educational attainment and worse health outcomes than\nbigger cities. These communities are too often distanced from quality jobs, transportation,\nchild care and anchor institutions. This isolation can be deepened by a lack of adequate\nbroadband to stay connected. And we all know that COVID-19 exacerbated these issues —\nwhich we discussed at last year’s conference.\nI don’t need to linger on the challenges. The practitioners in this room know them better\nthan anyone. Every month, I visit small towns and hear directly from business and\ncommunity leaders about what’s working, what’s not working and what they need. And\neverywhere — across every issue — I hear one critical need that constrains how much\nchange a community can make: money.\nBut we are in a unique moment. Multiple rounds of federal stimulus (combined with\nhealthy state and local government balance sheets) means that billions of dollars are being\nmade available for small towns across the country, on top of those available through\nprivate grant-makers.\nBut getting access to all this funding is hard. And not without reason: We want\ngovernments to be careful with our tax dollars. Funders only want to invest if they can be\nconvinced they will see impact. But the constraints they place on accessing funding don’t\nalways align with local capacity, needs and opportunities.\nToday, I want to talk about some of the funding that is available, the barriers small towns\nface in accessing this funding and what those of us who want to make a di�erence can do\nto reduce these barriers.\nLet’s start with the funding itself. At the federal level, the opportunities are breathtaking.\nThere are grants to support environmentally impacted communities, to rebuild food supply\nchains, to build infrastructure, to connect communities technologically, to �nance\ninnovation, to provide access to quality health care in places without local hospitals or\nproviders and to fund pandemic recovery.\nTaken together, the available funds have the potential to move the needle on some key\nrural challenges. Look at\nOur research has suggested that it could cost roughly\n$80 billion to get ubiquitous broadband coverage across the country. If we take the money\ndedicated to broadband before the pandemic, the additional funds available through\npandemic relief bills, plus the allocations within the infrastructure bill, there is nearly 50\npercent more than that appropriated. If I did my math right, that’s more than enough to\nclose the gap.\nHow about\nAlmost $20 billion has already been distributed to providers in\nrural or small metropolitan areas. And there’s more to come from additional grants\ndesigned to strengthen rural community health by focusing on quality and access.\nOn\nthe American Rescue Plan Act allocated funds for COVID-19-related\ntransit within rural areas and to support bus travel within these areas. For example, the\nRural Formula Program provides capital, planning and operating assistance to support\n\n\fpublic transportation. Plus, there's money to support the completion of the Appalachian\nDevelopment Highway System.\nThis is a game-changing amount of money. But wherever I go, local leaders say it will be\nvery di�cult to access. Why is that? I hear three key barriers.\nThey require intensive research and documentation.\nApplications are often dozens — or even hundreds — of pages long, requiring sophisticated\ndata interpretation, technical writing and dozens of attachments. And the administrative\nrequirements can feel burdensome. Many organizations don’t have the necessary time or\nexpertise, particularly for grants that require unique data. For example, ARC POWER grants\nhelp coal-impacted communities. But we heard from one recipient that organizations\nshould set aside a whole month for the application process. And ARC is regarded by\ngrantees as one of the more �exible federal agencies — Economic Development\nAdministration (EDA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other agency grant\nprograms are often more restrictive and more complicated. Grant processes can be\ncomplicated for the agency making the grant too, which all too often �nds itself\nundersta�ed.\nMany grants require matching\nfunds that small communities can’t raise. For example, the Rural Surface Transportation\nGrant Program requires a 20 percent match. Sometimes funders will allow applicants to\nwaive match requirements, but that waiver can still lead to a lower application score.\nAdditionally, you usually can't match federal grants with other federal funds — even from\nanother agency. This means you need private funders or local governments that are ready\nto step up and provide time-sensitive match commitments, which often isn't possible in\nresource-constrained rural communities. Because of this, some low-resource communities\neither self-select out of applying for grants, or they signi�cantly downgrade the size of their\nprojects.\nGrantors quite naturally prefer to invest with\nsomeone they have con�dence has the capacity to deliver. So, they favor organizations with\na proven track record or with a leader they already know, which can leave less experienced\norganizations and under-resourced regions out of the running. It is possible, or even likely,\nthat the lion's share of federal funds will �ow to the institutions and organizations that are\nalready established and well-resourced.\nCommunities need help building their capacity, and they need it now. They need help\n�nding and training leadership. They need help writing grant applications that meet funder\nspeci�cations. They need help acquiring match funding. They need help distributing and\nadministering funds e�ectively. And they need help assessing impact.\nSo, let’s help them. The stimulus money is coming, so let’s leverage states, localities,\nfoundations and local organizations to get the money where it is most needed. I’m struck\nby the experience we all just had with rent relief and the varying degrees of success\n\n\fcommunities had in delivering that money to its intended recipients. As I have tried to think\nabout it, I see three tangible, practical opportunities, and you might see even more.\nThis could be done by hiring or funding experienced,\nproven grant writers directly. There is subject matter expertise out there, and foundations\ncan play a meaningful role helping to connect experts to small towns with opportunities.\nAlternatively, this could be done by providing targeted advice. For example, Generation\nWest Virginia and the Benedum Foundation work together to provide communities with\ngrant writing support and other forms of technical assistance to coach them through the\ncomplicated process of planning for and accessing broadband funding.\nThis could be a great role for states. If match funding is\nthe barrier, create a pool which goes to communities and local organizations that earn the\nmatch. Localities with excess funds coming out of the pandemic could step up too. This\nwould increase the number of grants applied for and productively leverage local money\nwith federal money. And anything a state can do to adequately resource the distribution of\nfunds would be of value too.\nI am intrigued by the idea of “rural development hubs,” as\nde�ned by the Aspen Community Strategies Group. These regional organizations build local\ncapacity. They foster creative development strategies and build connections between\nstates, funders and localities. They are close to their communities’ needs and wants. They\nserve as conveners, coordinators and intermediaries for grassroots e�orts, allowing\ncollections of projects and organizations to come together and pursue funding and\nstrategies that are only possible through collaboration.\nBut hubs take time to build, and they’re hard to start from scratch. Regional collaboration is\ndi�cult, as communities struggle to balance collaboration and competition for scarce\nresources. And some of the challenges to building hubs are similar to the challenges in\naccessing grant funding: They’re costly to launch and to scale.\nTo build local capacity for the long run, organizations need targeted support in the near\nterm. For example, funding from Rural LISC — a national organization — allowed the\nGarrett County Community Action Committee to expand to serve adjoining counties.\nFunders can also seed promising new approaches. The West Virginia Community\nDevelopment hub, which Stephanie Tyree will tell you more about today, often heard\ncomplaints that there was “nothing going on” in West Virginia. They created the Cultivate\nWest Virginia program, which distributes small-scale investments over a short time period\nto build momentum in communities. Teams of volunteers work alongside a coach to\nidentify needed projects, often leading to a broader shared vision. With this foundation, the\ncommunities can then collaborate on a larger scale. They start with small projects, like\ncreating a new welcome sign, and eventually, they are redeveloping their historic school\nthat’s been out of use for 30 years.\nCapacity building isn’t limited to local communities. Regionally, the Central Appalachian\n\n\fNetwork provides space for like-minded organizations to coordinate projects across state\nlines and to participate in regional sector development strategies, accessing federal funding\nfor large-scale initiatives related to local and regional food systems, clean energy\ndevelopment, waste reduction and workforce development. They help grow organizational\ncapacity through peer learning, mentorship and shared resources. New platforms like\nInvest Appalachia o�er a pathway for grant-funded projects and enterprises to transition\ntoward �nancial self-su�ciency, partnering with other �nancial intermediaries like\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to provide a blend of capital that\nincludes credit enhancements and �exible �nancing. And, while I know it isn’t rural, I was\nimpressed when I was in Petersburg, Virginia, last month to learn about an industryfocused regional cluster, which is attracting funding to build infrastructure that supports\nthe growth of that town and its pharmaceutical industry.\nHelping communities write grants, creating pools of match funding and supporting hubs to\nhelp build local capacity aren’t the only ways we can help small towns access this historic\nopportunity for funding. Perhaps there are better ideas than these, which I of course\nwelcome and hope we can surface today. Getting money to communities that need it isn’t\neasy. But this is a unique moment.\nThanks, and enjoy the conference.\nThank you to Abigail Crockett and Chantel Gerardo for assistance preparing these remarks. I\nwould also like to thank Andrew Crosson, Chris Estes, Jen Giovannitti, Emma Pepper, Bonita\nRobertson-Hardy, Jorge Rodriguez-Stanley, Charles Rutheiser, Stephanie Tyree and Duane\nYoder for their feedback.\n\nSmall Town and Rural Communities\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\n\fEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nMoney Marketeers of New York University\n\n• When the Fed determines how to contain in�ation, the conditions matter.\n• Before the pandemic, we had a period with \"the wind at our back\" when it came to\ncontaining in�ation. A number of disin�ationary factors a�ected the real economy\nand the Fed's success depended on us recognizing them, understanding their impact\nand adjusting.\n• The pandemic has been quite a storm; bringing, it seems, one short-term in�ationary\ngust after another. Initially, we thought in�ation would be short-lived. Now, with\nin�ation persisting and broadening, we have moved to start to normalize our\nmonetary policy stance.\n• What direction the winds will be blowing going forward remains an open question.\nThere are reasons to think we may face more headwinds, requiring us to navigate in\nthe context of more medium-term in�ationary pressure. If that's the case, we may\nneed to note the conditions and adjust.\n\nThis speech was delivered remotely.\nThanks for having me today. It’s great to be back in front of this group. Today, I want to take\na step back and look beyond today’s headlines. I caution these views are mine alone and\nnot necessarily those of any of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe direction of the wind matters. Jim Croce once famously said you don’t spit into the\nwind. The Irish blessing asks that the wind always be at your back. But maybe Virginia\ncountry singer and sausage entrepreneur Jimmy Dean said it best: We can’t change the\ndirection of the wind, but we can adjust our sails. If you’re a sailor like my daughter or even\n\n\fa golfer like me, that notion is pretty familiar. You adjust your game based on the\nconditions you face.\nI think this analogy extends to the question of how the Fed contains in�ation. The\nconditions matter. We take note, and we adjust our course.\nTo give my Fed predecessors due credit, a lot of work has gone into anchoring in�ation\nexpectations over the last generation. As a result, our economy has seen healthy growth\nand an era of remarkably low and stable in�ation.\nDuring this period, a number of disin�ationary factors a�ected the real economy. This\n“series of fortunate events” (if I can borrow from the children’s books) could be described\nas putting “the wind at our back” when it came to containing in�ation. But our success\ndepended on us recognizing those factors and adjusting. The best known such story is\nprobably in the late ‘90s, when the Fed deferred interest rate increases, recognizing that\ntechnology-enabled productivity would limit in�ationary pressure in that period.\nBut there are several other examples of disin�ationary forces:\nGlobalization, especially the rise of India and China, gave producers access to ever-greater\nproportions of lower-cost labor and consumers ever-increasing access to lower-cost\nproducts.\nTechnology enabled innovation. No one could have predicted the explosive growth of ecommerce, which lowered the barrier to price comparisons and cut costs for retailers. Or\nhow fracking provided additional supplies of natural gas and then oil once thought to be\ndepleting.\nThe “e�ective” labor force grew strongly, both in numbers (the baby-boom generation, high\nlevels of immigration and o�shore labor pools as mentioned earlier) and in participation\n(women in the workplace, higher educational attainment improving employability and\nbetter health enabling longer careers).\nProfessional purchasing organizations emerged and grew in retailers (e.g., Walmart) and\nmanufacturers (e.g., automobiles), exerting continual year-over-year pressure on costs, and\nconsequently prices.\nAnd the federal government in the era between the early ‘90s and the Great Recession ran\nrelatively low de�cits, meaning lower in�ationary �scal impulses.\nThese forces particularly in�uenced pricing for goods. Goods in�ation for the 20 years\nending in 2019 were low at 0.4 percent per year, while services grew at 2.6 percent a year,\nleaving core in�ation near target at 1.7 percent.\nWe recognized those disin�ationary tailwinds and — as we learned their impact — adjusted\npolicy. In the context of anchored in�ation expectations, perhaps that is why we kept\nin�ation near target for so long while running what was then conventionally viewed as\naccommodative policy. With wind at our back, a lighter touch on the rudder was all it took.\n\n\fIt’s hard to remember today, but just 15 months ago, 12-month core PCE was only 1.5\npercent. But it’s quite clear, the wind conditions have shifted, at least for now. The\npandemic has been quite a storm; bringing, it seems, one short-term in�ationary shock\nafter another.\nWe saw the pandemic shift demand to goods as it simultaneously suppressed supply of\nlabor both here and abroad. We saw sizable �scal stimulus escalate demand more broadly,\nwhile excess savings perhaps reduced labor supply. We saw new variants slow our labor\nmarket recovery further. We saw a long series of atypical events — a severe winter storm in\nTexas, a �re at a chip plant in Japan, a ship lodged in the Suez Canal, a backlog in Long\nBeach — sti�e the supply chain. And, of course, most recently we’ve seen commodity price\nshocks coming out of the con�ict in Ukraine and new lockdowns in China.\nWhere have these winds taken us?\nDemand is strong and looks to remain robust, fueled by healthy business and personal\nbalance sheets, the need to replenish low inventories and state governments that are �ush\nwith cash. We may see more variants, such as the one rising in Western Europe, but we are\nlearning to live with COVID-19. Supply is tight. As demand for goods exploded in the midst\nof the pandemic, supply chains have struggled to keep up, and now to catch up.\nLabor markets are also quite tight. Unemployment has dropped to 3.6 percent. In addition,\nthe pool of available labor has shrunk: 1.6 million fewer workers are in the workforce, and\nimmigration remains well below its pre-COVID-19 trend.\nAs a result, wages are up: Average hourly earnings have risen 5.6 percent. And price\nin�ation is elevated, with core PCE at 5.4 percent — the highest since April 1983. Over the\npast year, goods in�ation has been almost 10 percent, while services in�ation has been 4.6\npercent.\nThese shocks have required us, once again, to recognize changes and adjust our course.\nInitially, we thought in�ation would be short-lived, as it seemed largely driven by temporary\nfactors like chips in cars. But the fog of the pandemic made visibility di�cult.\nNow, with in�ation persisting and broadening, we see clearly that it is time to normalize our\nmonetary policy stance. At our last meeting, the Fed decided to raise interest rates 25 basis\npoints, and the median Federal Open Market Committee member forecasted seven rate\nincreases this year and three to four next year. These forecasts project in�ation to be\ncontained as pandemic pressures ease and rates move just past the median estimate of\nneutral.\nHow far we will need to raise rates in fact won’t be clear until we get closer to our\ndestination, but rest assured we will do what we must to address this recent bout of abovetarget in�ation. And this commitment does not necessarily require a hard landing. In fact, it\nmight help avoid one by convincing individuals and �rms that the Fed is committed to our\ntarget, thereby cementing in�ation expectations.\n\n\fAn interesting question for me is: Once these speci�c pandemic-era wind gusts fade, what\ndirection will the winds be blowing going forward?\nThere are a few reasons to think we may face more headwinds when it comes to containing\nin�ation going forward. That is, we may need to navigate in the context of more mediumterm in�ationary pressure than we have experienced during the Great Moderation.\nOver the last few years, we’ve seen tari�s, the pandemic, and the Ukrainian con�ict lay bare\nthe vulnerabilities associated with o�shoring and a globally complex supply chain. Moving\nforward, we are likely to see some deglobalization, as countries rethink their trading\nrelationships and �rms redesign their supply chains to prioritize resiliency, not just\ne�ciency. These changes would suggest higher costs and less ability for intermediaries to\ndrive year-over-year e�ciencies.\nWe may also see labor transition from being long to short. O�shore labor may prove less\navailable. At the same time, our population is aging. Birth rates are declining. We missed\nout on millions of immigrants during the pandemic. Reduced labor force growth can limit\ngrowth in the broader economy. And unless we can �nd a way to reduce labor demand\n(e.g., through automation) or increase participation (as Japan has done with older workers),\na tighter labor market could also pressure wages, and in turn, prices.\nFiscal policy may also be shifting in a way that contributes to the headwinds. Government\nde�cits are still running at historic levels, and entitlement spending will grow further as the\npopulation ages. Defense spending may grow as well. The coming investment in climate\ntransition risks elevating energy costs in the interim.\nFinally, the Great Moderation was marked by a relatively stable external environment. Who\nknows what the future holds.\nIf we �nd ourselves facing this “series of unfortunate events,” we will recognize headwinds\nthat become persistent and adjust how we navigate. Our goal — 2 percent target in�ation\n— wouldn’t change, nor would our longer-run ability to meet that goal, but the appropriate\npath to achieve it could.\nShould the prevailing winds shift, we would be more likely to face periods with real forces\nimparting near-term in�ationary pressure. These pressures could make “looking through”\nshort-term shocks more di�cult. As a consequence, our e�orts to stabilize in�ation\nexpectations could require periods where we tighten monetary policy more than has been\nour recent pattern. You might think of this as leaning against the wind. Doing so would be\nconsistent with our �exible average in�ation targeting framework.\nCommunicating e�ectively could also prove more challenging. In�ationary pressure puts\nconstantly on the table the potential for a trade-o� between employment and in�ation, our\ndual mandate goals. In contrast, the last 10 years have seen little con�ict between our goals\nin making policy, and so the Fed’s decisions have been relatively easier to explain. We will\nneed to be crystal clear that a growing economy requires stable prices, and that we will\nremain committed to addressing in�ationary gusts.\n\n\fWe don’t need to make any of these judgments now. It is notoriously di�cult to pinpoint\nshifts in the weather, and the old joke is that economic forecasting was invented to make\nweather forecasters look good. Innovations happen, and it’s of course possible that\ntechnology will again create tailwinds we haven’t anticipated. Without perfect foresight, the\nbest short-term path for us is to move rapidly to the neutral range and then test whether\npandemic-era in�ation pressures are easing, and how persistent in�ation has become.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nCecil County Chamber of Commerce\nElkton, Md.\n\n• Since the mid-'90s, in�ation has been low and stable. But no one is forgetting\nin�ation today. At �rst, in�ationary pressures seemed temporary, driven by\npandemic reopening or supply chain challenges like chips in cars. But the in�ationary\nnews just keeps coming.\n• All of this has depressed consumer sentiment, and business sentiment has fallen\ntoo. So, we need to get in�ation under control.\n• I see in�ation coming down on two paths. A number of these pandemic-era\npressures will eventually settle. At the same time, interest rates will impact demand\nand expectations. And, as we act, we send messages to consumers and �rms that\nwill manage their expectations for future in�ation. All this will take a little time, but\nmake no mistake, we are on the case.\n\nIt’s great to be with you in person today — and thank you to Debbie and Sharon for inviting\nme and that nice introduction. I want to spend today talking about in�ation. These are my\nviews alone and not those of any of my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nI grew up in the ‘60s and ‘70s — an era when in�ation emerged and then became\nomnipresent and painful. A wage and price freeze left supermarket shelves bare. Twin oil\ncrises led to panic at the pump. President Ford issued Whip In�ation Now buttons. You\ncouldn’t go anywhere without hearing the Bee Gees — it was a tough time. By the mid-‘70s,\ncore Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) in�ation reached 10.2 percent — nearly\ntwice as high as what it is today.\n\n\fBut in the early ‘80s, the Fed under Paul Volcker actually did whip in�ation. Of course,\nthings got bad before they got better — it was the ultimate hard landing: Unemployment\nreached nearly 11 percent in 1982. The economy fell into not one, but two recessions. But\nsince the mid-‘90s, in�ation has been low and stable. And the Fed learned a hard lesson:\nthe role in�ation targeting plays in delivering anchored in�ation expectations, thereby\ncreating a healthy foundation for the economy.\nI have a theory that memory matters. Recessions happen every 8-10 years because that’s\nhow long it takes for a leadership team to rotate, believe they know better and then repeat\nthe errors of their predecessors. Real estate lenders overreach every 15-20 years (1970s,\n1990s, 2000s) as credit o�cers turn over and memories fade. The Roaring ‘20s, the Go-Go\n‘60s and the internet bubble of the early 2000s perhaps demonstrated that market\nmemories only last 30-40 years. And after 30 years of price stability, maybe the same thing\nhappened with in�ation. Prior to the pandemic, the focus was on how to move in�ation\nup, not down. The Phillips curve came into question. Virtually no professional forecaster\npredicted the high, persistent in�ation we’ve been experiencing.\nWell, no one is forgetting in�ation today. The most recent Consumer Price Index is 8.5\npercent. The headline PCE, our preferred metric, is 6.6 percent. Core PCE is at 5.2 percent.\nDemand is strong and looks to remain robust, fueled by healthy business and personal\nbalance sheets, the need to replenish low inventories and state governments that are �ush\nwith cash. Supply chains have been overwhelmed, and suppliers are struggling to bring\nthem back into balance. Labor markets are also tight: Unemployment has dropped to 3.6\npercent. In addition, the pool of available labor has shrunk: 1.2 million fewer workers are in\nthe workforce, and immigration remains well below its pre-COVID-19 trend. As a result,\nprice pressures are everywhere. In�ation is high, persistent and broad-based.\nAt �rst, in�ationary pressures seemed temporary, driven by pandemic reopening or supply\nchain challenges like chips in cars. But the in�ationary news just keeps coming, whether it is\na severe winter storm in Texas, a �re at a chip plant in Japan, a ship lodged in the Suez\nCanal or a backlog in Long Beach. And, of course, most recently, we’ve seen commodity\nprice shocks coming out of the con�ict in Ukraine and new lockdowns in China. These have\nmade in�ation the headline of the day — as of May 1, the Wall Street Journal has had an\nin�ation story on its front page 25 times this year. And on social media, a widely shared\npost jokes that in 2020 we couldn’t leave the house because of COVID-19; now, we can’t\nleave because of skyrocketing gas prices.\nAll of this has depressed consumer sentiment. In the most recent Michigan Survey, the\noverall index of consumer sentiment (April - 65.2) was at levels last seen in the aftermath of\nthe Great Recession and is below where it was at the height of pandemic lockdowns. That is\nremarkable given the strength of the economy and the job market. But sentiment is being\ndriven heavily by in�ation. Respondents expect the year-ahead in�ation rate to remain high\nat 5.4 percent. The last two months have had the highest expectations since 1981. Thirtyeight percent say they’re in a worse �nancial position than they were a year ago. Buying\n\n\fconditions for purchasing a car, a house or an appliance are at their lowest levels since the\nearly ‘80s.\nBusiness sentiment has fallen too. In the Richmond Fed’s most recent CFO Survey\n(conducted in partnership with Duke and the Atlanta Fed), optimism about the U.S.\neconomy dropped nearly 6 points from the fourth quarter of 2021. CFOs cited cost\npressures and in�ation as their top concerns. When looking at small-business owners,\noptimism is even lower. In March, owners who expect better business conditions over the\nnext six months dropped to the lowest level in the survey’s history. Like the CFOs we\nsurveyed, in�ation was their top business problem.\nWe now remember that people thoroughly dislike in�ation. Workers who feel they have\nearned their wage gains feel arbitrarily pinched at the gas pump. Homeowners like their\nsale price but can’t believe their purchase price. Businesses work to capture value through\npricing but feel they’re being taken advantage of by suppliers. They feel powerless in the\nface of cost increases that tax their revenues, earnings and appreciation they have worked\nto achieve.\nWhy do people hate in�ation? Well, no one likes to deal with change, and we haven’t had to\nthink about in�ation for over a generation. And no one remembers the ‘70s fondly. In�ation\ncreates uncertainty — as prices rise unevenly across sectors and over time, it becomes\nunclear when is the right time to spend versus save and where to invest. In�ation is also\ninherently redistributive — in the ‘70s, those who owned a house with a cheap mortgage\nbene�tted; those on �xed incomes didn’t. Those who had wages indexed to in�ation did\nbetter than those who didn’t. And in�ation adds to your workload. It takes e�ort to shop\naround for better prices. Businesses have to handle complaints from unhappy customers,\nnegotiate with insistent suppliers and address any resulting margin pressure. Finally,\nRobert Shiller taught us that people feel in�ation erodes their standard of living by\ndiminishing their buying power, whether it raises their nominal income or not. Higher\nprices mean you can buy less.\nThe pain of in�ation tends to hit low- and �xed-income populations the most. Low-income\nhouseholds dedicate a higher percentage of their wages to consumption than those with\nhigher incomes. There are estimates that the average U.S. household will have to spend\nover $5,000 more this year compared to last year for the same consumption basket, and\nthat impacts those who have a tighter monthly budget.\nTo be clear, not everyone loses with in�ation. We have sectors where nominal wages are up\nwell in excess of in�ation, like leisure and hospitality. We have a lot of homeowners whose\nhouses are worth much more than they could have imagined. And a number of �rms\nreported record pro�ts last year. But it doesn’t matter — everyone hates in�ation.\nSo, we need to get in�ation under control. Congress has given us this mandate. And it’s\ntime.\nWe can’t do much about short-term price surges. Think of it like the aftermath of a\n\n\fhurricane. Lumber prices increase temporarily as demand spikes for materials to make\nnecessary repairs. Raising rates wouldn’t lower lumber prices when people need to rebuild\ntheir homes. Instead, when supply catches up to demand, these price movements reverse\nthemselves.\nBut in the medium term, our moves matter. So, we have begun a tightening process. We\nraised interest rates 25 basis points in March and then another 50 basis points in May. We\nalso announced our plans to reduce our balance sheet, starting on June 1. During his press\nconference, Chair Powell noted that additional 50 basis point increases could be on the\ntable in coming meetings as we work to normalize rates.\nWe will do what we need to do to contain in�ation. But how exactly will our rate moves do\nthat? I see in�ation coming down on two paths. A number of these pandemic-era pressures\nwill eventually settle. Chips will �nally get into cars, and car prices will come down. Labor\nforce participation will continue to rise as COVID-19 eases. Ports will open up as consumers\nrotate back from goods to services. At the same time, interest rates will impact demand\nand expectations. Borrowing rates have already risen, and that will a�ect investment levels\nand spending on interest-sensitive items like houses and cars. And, as we act, we send\nmessages to consumers and �rms that will manage their expectations for future in�ation.\nAll of this will take a little time, but make no mistake, we are on the case.\nYou might ask if this path requires a Volcker-like recession. Not necessarily. At 83 basis\npoints, we are still far from the level of interest rates that constrains the economy; for my\ncolleagues on the FOMC, this neutral rate is in the range of 2-3 percent. And before the\nGreat Recession, the economy handled rates even higher than that. Once we get in the\nrange of the neutral rate, we can then determine whether in�ation remains at a level that\nrequires us to put the brakes on the economy or not.\nIn�ation is high. It has real costs to both individuals and businesses. By contrast, getting\nin�ation closer to the target rate creates the certainty that enables growth and supports\nmaximum employment. That’s why we care, and that’s why we are tackling it.\nThis re�ects the di�erence in total nonfarm payroll employment between February 2020 and\nApril 2022.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nBefore the pandemic, the o�ce was a core feature of modern life. It was prominent in the\nskyscraper architecture of downtowns, and in the professional attire sections of\ndepartment stores. And it dominated popular culture, not only in the namesake TV show\n\"The O�ce,\" but in the countless shows and movies centered around the workplace, from\n\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" to \"The Devil Wears Prada.\"\nWe have now had a two-year experiment with a di�erent, home-based model. As we\nemerge from the pandemic era, some are abandoning o�ces altogether. Others are trying\nto make a full return to pre-pandemic normal. Many of us are in the middle, trying to de�ne\nand operate a new hybrid model that embraces the �exibility of remote work while\nreintroducing the features we missed from in-person work.\nIt will take time for the markets to decide on the winning stance for each sector. But now\nthat the pandemic has shown we can operate remotely, I've little doubt we will see\nemployers o�er increased �exibility. Employees value it, and recruiters are �nding it an\nimportant lever (several examples were in the most recent Beige Book). It is pairing workers\nand companies that otherwise wouldn't have considered each other (whether due to\ngeography, family duties or health). Increased �exibility could allow for better matches and\nimproved lifestyles. It could pull more workers into the workforce and help businesses\nincrease productivity through improved hiring pools and reduced real estate needs.\nBut �exibility won't be costless. O�ces evolved into the dominant model for good reasons,\nand companies are rightfully hesitant to lose those bene�ts. Originally, the bene�t was\ne�ciency and productivity — centralization of operations and administrative work. But,\nover time, it became clear that o�ces provide much more.\nO�ces help spark ideas. We often hear economists talk about agglomeration economies —\nthe bene�ts from clustering companies and workers together — in relation to cities. We see\nthose same e�ects in the o�ce context. Proximity facilitates the exchange of ideas among\nworkers, which fosters collaboration, innovation and productivity.\n\n\fThat innovation is a product of the interaction we see in o�ces. Unplanned lunches in the\ncafeteria and quick walks to get co�ee can build organically over time into friendships and\nsometimes, even deeper relationships. Small talk at the beginning of meetings or water\ncooler conversations can evolve into mentor relationships. Relationships build loyalty\namong employees, and in turn, to the institution itself.\nThose interactions provide information to management and sta�. After two years of online\nmeetings, it may be hard to remember just how much insight we gain from nonverbal cues.\nO�ces help managers and co-workers observe behaviors otherwise hard to track, such as\nvalues, development needs, level of e�ort or emotional well-being. They also help\nemployees with the unspoken rules of the workplace. It's much easier to know how open\nyour co-workers are to questions and feedback if you see whether their o�ce doors are\nliterally open to you. O�ces also expose employees to parts of the organization beyond\ntheir own teams, providing visibility into potential career options.\nAll these combine with the physical space to create the organization's identity. The o�ce\nenvironment can help employees feel connected. The space — and how people move in it\n— re�ects the company. Is the space set up for individual or group work? Does leadership\njoin for lunch? Is it laid-back or fairly formal? Beyond establishing the vibe, as my kids might\nsay, the o�ce is a visible reminder that employees are part of something larger, fostering\ncommitment. Note the investments made in Silicon Valley to design iconic workspaces.\nThese bene�ts seem intangible, but their loss could impact business outcomes. Fewer\nserendipitous encounters could reduce innovation. Lower exposure to best practices could\nlessen productivity. Less identi�cation with the institution (as well as less fear of showing\nup to work with suspiciously formal attire) could lead to increased turnover. Poorer\nrelationships could hamper career development.\nWe should expect innovative companies to develop ways to reduce these potential losses.\nThey will be intentional about both the tools and practices that enhance their time apart,\nand the time they spend together.\nMost of the attention right now seems to be on the \"new\" part of hybrid — how can we\nbest manage technology and the days out of the o�ce? Zoom was a revelation two years\nago. But now, in the hybrid era, we are seeing investments in full immersion team rooms,\nand best practice hybrid meeting protocols in an e�ort to make in-person and remote\nexperiences more comparable. In time, we may even see organizations �nd a method for\nonline team building that's a little less painful than virtual happy hours. To me,\ntechnological enablement of personal connectivity is the hardest solution to picture, but I'm\nmindful not to prejudge: After all, my kids are much more connected to their high school\nfriends via social media than my friends and I managed to be with letters and calls.\nCompanies also need to intentionally reinvent the o�ce environment. The in-person\nroutine in a successful hybrid stance is unlikely to look the same as what works for a full inperson stance.\n\n\fDuring my time as a consultant in the mid-80s, I saw what a di�erence a small amount of\nintentionality can make. Our work model was 100 percent at our clients. We built great\nteam and client relationships but not enough of a relationship with our �rm. Individuals'\nlink to the �rm was easily severed when a tempting o�er came along. Attrition was skyhigh. In response, we started to require consultants to come to the o�ce on Fridays.\nImportantly, we invested in programming to maximize the value of that time. We saw\nconnections strengthen and engagement levels soar. Attrition fell.\nThe truth is that the mentorship, relationship and engagement aspects of the o�ce\nenvironment have largely been incidental o�shoots of time together. With less time in the\no�ce overall, and less overlap of those days, companies will need to become more\nintentional. This will require conscious programming, as the Richmond Fed's research\ndepartment has launched with its \"Core Week\" concept which groups a series of\nconferences, seminars and research collaborations to create meaningful connections.\nMany organizations are similarly experimenting with more formal mentorship and\nsponsorship programs.\nEnabling more connectivity may require rethinking spending. Some companies are\nreconsidering their physical footprint and lowering real estate costs as a consequence.\nThey should be thinking about redeploying some of those savings into connectivity spend,\nincluding meals and social events in the o�ce, and occasions to bring people together\noutside the workplace. In a world of less day-to-day personal contact, these investments\ncan enhance mutual trust and relationships.\nThere's a lot which we will miss about the old o�ce, just like we miss its TV namesake. But\n�exibility is here to stay. And if we are honest with ourselves, we know we aren't optimizing\nthe hybrid environment today. To make it meet its full potential, we need to leverage the\npower of technology while innovating to recreate the bene�ts which the o�ce once\nprovided.\nThat will require real intentionality.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nProduction and Investment\n\n\fReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

But the Fed has the tools to contain in�ation over the mediumterm, and we are committed to returning in�ation to our target.\n• The elevated concern about a recession is understandable. But the challenge in\npredicting a recession tomorrow is the strength of the aggregate data today.\n• A slowdown from our current situation must be kept in perspective. We are out of\nbalance today. Returning to normal doesn’t have to require a calamitous decline in\nactivity.\n• The Fed has the credibility with households, businesses and markets required to\nreturn in�ation back to normal levels. There is of course recession risk along the way,\nbut there’s also the prospect of the economy returning closer to normal.\n\nI like giving speeches. The economy matters to everyone. When I speak, I get to share what\nthe Fed is learning and doing, in what I hope is plain English. But my favorite part of every\nspeech is when it ends. Of course, I hope that won’t be your favorite part today.\nI like ending a speech because that’s when I get to hear from you. Through your comments\nand questions, I learn how you’re experiencing the economy and what’s top of mind. Before\nthe pandemic, the most popular question was when our lengthy expansion would end.\nThen, of course it was the impact of COVID-19. Once stimulus passed, it became the de�cit.\nLast year, audiences moved on to the de�nition of “transitory” and the value of\ncryptocurrencies. And so far this year, it’s been all about rate increases.\nSo, what am I hearing today? Two questions. The �rst would have been hard to imagine just\n\n\ftwo years ago: “Will in�ation go back down to normal levels?” Remember it had lagged our\ntwo percent target ever since the Great Recession. The second goes full circle, asking again,\n“Are we headed into a recession?”\nToday, I want to try to tackle those questions. I caution that these are my thoughts and not\nthose of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. I also feel obliged to repeat the joke\nthat economic forecasters were created to make weather forecasters look good. After all,\nwhen I answered recession questions three years ago, I certainly didn’t talk about a\npandemic shock.\nSo, �rst: “Will in�ation return to normal?” That answer is simple: yes. In�ation is too high.\nBut the Fed has the tools to contain in�ation over the medium-term, and we are committed\nto returning in�ation to our target. You’ve likely seen that over our last three meetings we\nhave raised rates 150 basis points, started shrinking our balance sheet and signaled there\nare more rate increases to come. We are meeting the test we face and have made clear we\nwill do what it takes.\nBut that commitment, which hopefully you welcome, directly leads to the second question:\n“Are we headed into a recession?” I would caution that no one canceled the business cycle,\nso one can never fully rule out a recession — it’s just a question of timing. But I get why the\nconcern might be elevated today.\nFirst, consumer and business sentiment are quite negative. In the most recent Michigan\nSurvey, consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level on record. In addition, the percentage of\nsmall business owners who expect better conditions over the next six months dropped to\nthe lowest level in that survey’s history in May. Both surveys show in�ation driving this\npessimism. Typically, sentiment this low is associated with a weakening in consumer\nspending and business investment.\nAt the same time, �scal support from the pandemic is waning, and — as I mentioned —\nin�ation is moving the Fed to increase rates. Higher rates tend to slow the economy by\nincreasing borrowing costs and disincentivizing spending and investment. Historically, eight\nof the last 11 Fed tightening cycles have been followed by some sort of a recession.\nThat change in policy may well be making markets skittish. That’s understandable: The Fed\nhasn’t moved this quickly in over 20 years. And forecasters are predicting that our current\nrate increase cycle will go higher than its predecessor’s relatively low 2.4 percent 2019 peak.\nNow, the stock market is not the economy. But if markets were to crater, that could slow\nthe economy by leading individuals and �rms to pull back their spending and investment.\nThose who look more closely for signals may be pointing to �ashing lights coming from the\n2-10 yield curve, a closely watched recession predictor that inverted brie�y in March and\nagain in mid-June. When short-term interest rates are higher than long-term ones, markets\nsee risk on the horizon. The 2-10 yield curve has predicted eight of the last seven\nrecessions. I should note that Fed research suggests it’s the short end of the yield curve\nthat is a cleaner signal — and that end remains steep.\n\n\fAnother frequently cited signal has been the dramatic recent increase in oil prices, which\nhas occurred in advance of most of our past recessions.\nThere’s also a fear about what else may come our way. We’ve already seen multiple supply\nside challenges, including pandemic-era shortages, the war in Ukraine and the lockdowns in\nChina. Each has fanned the �ames of in�ation and raised questions about future demand.\nWho knows what is to come next?\nSo, I understand why some are forecasting a recession. And risk managers like you need to\nconsider this risk in your scenario planning. But the challenge in predicting a recession for\ntomorrow is the strength of the aggregate data today.\nConsumer spending is about two-thirds of the economy, and it remains quite healthy,\nsupported by strong personal balance sheets, excess savings accrued during the pandemic\nand freedom from COVID-19 restrictions. Just try to book a trip this summer. We are seeing\nspending pivot from goods to services (a�ecting some retailers), and early signs of stress\nfor those with lower incomes — but not enough to a�ect the overall numbers. The negative\n�rst quarter GDP was driven by one-time reversals in inventories and net exports and\nshould rebound this quarter. The unemployment rate is historically low at 3.6 percent, and\nthere are still 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person. While rates are rising\nexpeditiously, they have not yet reached the level which constrains the economy. I have\nnoted pullbacks in auto and home sales, but — with prices still rising — attribute both\nmostly to continuing supply shortages.\nAnd household and bank balance sheets look healthy. Households and �nancial institutions\ndeleveraged after the Great Recession. By the start of the pandemic, households had\nreturned to debt levels last seen in 2001, and many used stimulus funds to pay debt down\neven further. You can see the di�erent dynamics in play by looking at the housing market. If\nthe phrase of the day before the Great Recession was “subprime mortgages,” today it’s\n“cash o�er.” We are in a very di�erent place.\nSo, data on today’s economy still looks relatively healthy. Tomorrow is of course unclear.\nOur path forward depends on three signi�cant uncertainties. First, how long will it take the\npandemic’s impact on spending, labor supply and supply chains to normalize? Second, how\nhigh does the Fed need to raise rates to calm demand, bring in�ation down and keep\nin�ation expectations anchored? And third, what other outside forces will push demand\nand/or in�ation up or down?\nBarring an unanticipated event, I see rising rates stabilizing any drift in in�ation\nexpectations and in so doing, increasing real interest rates and quieting demand.\nCompanies will slow down their hiring. Revenge spending will settle. Savings will be held a\nlittle tighter. At the same time, supply chains will ease; you have to believe chips will get\nback into cars at some point. That means in�ation should come down over time — but it\nwill take time.\nThis moderation of demand could happen without crossing the line into the technical\n\n\fde�nition of a recession. But my dad was a depression child, and he taught me not to\nexpect the best case and run the risk of being disappointed. Instead, I always have my mind\naround the downside, and welcome it if I’m positively surprised. Perhaps many of you in\nrisk management think the same way. A recession downside would of course be unwanted,\nbut not all recessions are equal. We’ve been scarred by our memories of the Great\nRecession and the Volcker recession, but it’s worth remembering that most other\nrecessions aren’t that long or that deep.\nAnd a slowdown from our current situation must be kept in perspective: We are out of\nbalance today because stimulus-supported excess demand overwhelmed supply\nconstrained by the pandemic and global commodity shocks. Returning to normal means\nproducts on shelves, restaurants fully sta�ed and cars at auto dealers. It doesn’t have to\nrequire a calamitous decline in activity. As for �nancial markets, they are hardly the whole\neconomy, but even they could bene�t from rea�rmation that trees don’t grow to the sky\nand a reminder that valuations are always worth a fresh look.\nMost importantly, moderating demand has a higher purpose squarely in our mandate:\ncontaining in�ation. If there is any lesson that’s been relearned in the last year, it is that\neveryone hates in�ation. Workers who feel they have earned wage gains feel arbitrarily\npinched at the gas pump. Homeowners like their sale price but can’t believe their purchase\nprice. Businesses work to capture value through pricing but feel they’re being taken\nadvantage of by suppliers.\nWhy do they hate in�ation? In�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it\nbecomes unclear when to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It\ntakes work to shop around for better prices and for �rms to handle complaints from\nunhappy customers and negotiate with insistent suppliers. And in�ation seems unfair. In\nthe ‘70s, those who owned a house with a cheap mortgage bene�ted; those on �xed\nincomes did not.\nThe Fed is on a path to return in�ation back to normal levels.

There is of course recession risk along the\nway, but there’s also the prospect of the economy returning closer to normal.\nAnd now for the part I like the best.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nShenandoah Valley Partnership\nBlue Ridge Community College\nWeyers Cave, Va.\n\n• The pre-pandemic decade was an unusually stable one in economic terms. COVID\ndisrupted that stability. And similar to a post-war period, we are seeing the economy\nnow struggle to return to normal.\n• At �rst, in�ationary pressures seemed temporary. But in�ation has persisted, risen\nand become broader based. It’s the Fed’s responsibility to act to reduce in�ation and\nstabilize expectations, and we are.\n• The Fed’s tools work over time, so I expect in�ation to come down, but not\nimmediately, not suddenly, and not predictably. I see in�ation coming down in three\nlanes: demand should �atten, supply chains should heal and commodities should\nsettle. The pace of normalization is uncertain, which is understandably unsettling\nand leads to worries about a recession.\n• We are out of balance today because stimulus-supported excess demand\noverwhelmed constrained supply. Returning to normal does not require a calamitous\ndecline in activity.\n• Moderating demand has a higher purpose squarely in our mandate: containing\nin�ation. We have been reminded this year: in�ation is painful and people hate it.\n\nThanks for that nice introduction. It’s great to be back and to have the opportunity to trade\nviews on what’s happening in the economy. I’ll start with my thoughts, but caution they are\nmine alone and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. And I\nlook forward to your questions at the end.\n\n\fI should start with some context. The pre-pandemic decade was an unusually stable one in\neconomic terms. GDP grew consistently between 1.5 and 3 percent a year. We added jobs\nin every month after 2010. Core in�ation stayed in the narrow range of 1 to 2 percent.\nCOVID-19 of course has changed all that. I like analogies, and one relevant to today’s\nsituation is the aftermath of war. War upends economies: The government invests\nmassively; labor leaves the workplace, sadly some permanently; manufacturing plants are\nrecon�gured to produce weapons; consumers shift their spending to support the e�ort.\nAnd when a war ends, economies struggle to return to normal. There’s often a �scal\nhangover. Soldiers need retraining. Plants need to restart, with supply chains fragile. And,\namid all this adjustment, euphoric consumers spend freely.\nAs a result, at the end of a war, in�ation typically spikes. After both world wars, in�ation\nrose above 20 percent. And most of us remember well the postwar Vietnam ’70s\n(recognizing there were multiple sources of that in�ation).\nWith apologies to those who’ve experienced the horror of an actual war, look at the\naftermath of the “war on COVID.” Six trillion dollars of �scal stimulus has hit the economy.\nWorkers have stayed home, with participation still well below pre-pandemic levels. Many\nhave died. Businesses have struggled with meeting demand as supply chains proved\nvulnerable to the virus and consumer spending shifted in a locked down world. Postvaccine, euphoric consumers have been revenge spending. All of that has been\nexacerbated by an actual war – in Ukraine – that has driven up commodity prices. As a\nresult, we are again faced with postwar-like in�ation. The CPI is at a 40-year high of 9.1\npercent. The Fed’s preferred metric, PCE, is 6.8 percent headline, and 4.8 percent core.\nAt �rst, these in�ationary pressures seemed temporary, driven by pandemic reopening or\nsupply chain challenges like semiconductor chips. But in�ation has persisted, risen and\nbecome ever broader based. So the Fed’s responsibility is to act to reduce in�ation and\nstabilize expectations, and we are. You’ve likely seen that over our last four meetings we\nhave raised rates 225 basis points, started shrinking our balance sheet and signaled there\nare more rate increases to come. We are committed to returning in�ation to our 2 percent\ntarget and have made clear we will do what it takes.\nThe Fed’s tools work over time. So I expect in�ation to come down but not immediately, not\nsuddenly and not predictably. Some sectors are in oversupply; others still have cost\nincreases they are passing on. After a decade of stability has been replaced by extreme\nvolatility, I’d expect in�ation to bounce around on its way back to our target. These\nsigni�cant shock waves will take time to dampen.\nI see in�ation coming down in three lanes.\nFirst, demand should �atten, reducing pricing pressure. Fiscal stimulus has waned, and\nexcess savings are being spent down. The Fed has a lot of in�uence here. Higher rates\nshould slow the economy by increasing borrowing costs and disincentivizing spending and\ninvestment. We are starting to see some precautionary softening in business investment\n\n\fand slowing in interest-sensitive sectors like housing. Real consumer spending grew only\n0.1 percent in June.\nSecond, pandemic supply chain challenges should heal as pandemic pressures ease and\ncompanies adjust. Manufacturers will get chips into cars at some point and – when they do\n– those prices should start to normalize. On the margin, weakening demand could help by\ngiving businesses space to catch up on hiring and inventories. We’ve seen some early\nsignals of this healing, with freight costs decelerating, large retailers announcing that they\nare now more than fully stocked and employers having more hiring success, but it will still\ntake time for these pressures to fully abate.\nAnd �nally, there’s the commodities lane, items like oil and wheat. Global events are driving\nthis part of in�ation, and the Fed has little in�uence here. But we are seeing over the last\ntwo months, the dollar strengthening and gasoline and even the broader range of\ncommodities dropping from peak pricing levels. Hopefully commodities will continue to\nnormalize and not be victim to further events (like a natural gas shut-o� in Europe).\nThese three lanes are hard to forecast, so the pace of normalization is uncertain. As a\nresult, our commitment to bring in�ation to target, which hopefully you welcome, leads to\nworries about a recession. That’s especially true now that we have seen two consecutive\nquarters with negative (albeit noisy) estimates of GDP growth. Recession fears are a little\ninconsistent with an economy adding almost 400,000 jobs a month and with\nunemployment near its historic low at 3.6 percent. But I understand the concerns.\nFirst, in�ation has made consumer and business sentiment quite negative. In the most\nrecent Michigan Survey, consumer sentiment was near its record low. The percentage of\nsmall business owners who expect better conditions over the next six months dropped to\nthe lowest level in that survey’s history in June. Typically, sentiment this low is associated\nwith a weakening like the one we are seeing in consumer spending and business\ninvestment. Some call that “talking ourselves into a recession.”\nAt the same time – as I mentioned – in�ation is moving the Fed to increase rates.\nHistorically, eight of the last 11 Fed tightening cycles have been followed by some sort of a\nrecession.\nThat change in policy may well be making markets skittish. That’s understandable: The Fed\nhasn’t moved this quickly in over 20 years. Markets had a rough �rst half of the year, and\nmarket trauma sometimes can cause investors and businesses to pull back.\nThose who look more closely for signals point to �ashing lights coming from the 2-10 yield\ncurve, a closely watched recession predictor that has now inverted. When short-term\ninterest rates are higher than long-term ones, markets see risk on the horizon. The 2-10\nyield curve has predicted eight of the last seven recessions.\nAnother frequently cited signal has been the dramatic recent increase in oil prices, which\nhas occurred in advance of most of our past recessions.\n\n\fThere’s also a fear about what else may come our way. We’ve already seen multiple supply\nside challenges, including pandemic-era shortages, the war in Ukraine and the lockdowns in\nChina. Each has fanned the �ames of in�ation and raised questions about future demand.\nWho knows what is coming next?\nSo there is a path to getting in�ation under control. But a recession could happen in the\nprocess. If one does, we need to keep it in perspective: No one canceled the business cycle.\nWe are out of balance today because stimulus-supported excess demand overwhelmed\nsupply constrained by the pandemic and global commodity shocks. Returning to normal\nmeans products on shelves, restaurants fully sta�ed and cars at auto dealers. It doesn’t\nhave to require a calamitous decline in activity. Indeed, lower prices may create room for\nconsumers to spend again. As for �nancial markets, they are not the economy. And\nbaselines matter. Equities are down this year but still signi�cantly up from pre-pandemic\nlevels. We might soon have the same conversation about houses were prices to slip after\ntwo years of extraordinary gains.\nMost importantly, moderating demand has a higher purpose squarely in our mandate:\ncontaining in�ation. If there is any lesson that’s been relearned in the last year, it is that\nin�ation is painful, and everyone hates it.\nWhy do we hate in�ation so much? In�ation creates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it\nbecomes unclear when to spend, when to save or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It\ntakes work to shop around for better prices and for �rms to handle complaints from\nunhappy customers and negotiate with insistent suppliers. And in�ation seems unfair. In\nthe ’70s, those who owned a house with a cheap mortgage bene�ted; those on �xed\nincomes did not. Workers who feel they have earned wage gains feel arbitrarily pinched at\nthe gas pump. Homeowners like their sale price but can’t believe their purchase price.\nBusinesses work to capture value through pricing but feel they’re being taken advantage of\nby suppliers.\nStabilizing expectations by getting in�ation to target creates the certainty that enables\ngrowth and supports maximum employment. In�ation got under control after World War I,\nsetting up the Roaring ‘20s. It got under control after World War II, setting up the prosperity\nof the ‘50s and ‘60s. It lingered for far too long after the Vietnam War – a period we don’t\nwant to repeat. So the Fed is committed to getting in�ation under control. We may or may\nnot get help from global events and supply chains, but we have the tools, and we have the\ncredibility with households, businesses and markets required to deliver that outcome over\ntime and we will.\nAnd with that, I’d welcome your questions and insights.\n\n\fIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nIt's that time of year again. I don't mean the sudden crispness in the air nor the return of\nfootball season. It's back-to-school time, and once again we are talking about challenges in\nK-12 sta�ng.\nThis scramble for teachers and sta� coincides with the recent news that the overall U.S.\neconomy has recovered 100 percent of the jobs lost during the pandemic. It's a reminder\nthat the jobs recovery has been unequal across sectors, leaving segments of our economy\nbehind.\nThe economy is not just missing K-12 sta�. It is short nurses, child care workers and elder\ncare providers, too — all jobs that are essential in supporting the development and\nparticipation of workers in our economy.\nTaking a historic lens, these occupations were some of the pathways most readily available\nto women before they began entering the workforce in larger numbers. Take nursing, for\nexample. In 1950, almost 100 percent of nurses were women. In public education, over 60\npercent of the 1950 workforce was female. Today, these remain majority woman careers.\nAlmost 90 percent of nurses are still women, and local public education is over 70 percent\nwomen. Child care and elder care sta�ng is over 80 percent women. Some have observed\nthat the history of the labor supply for these critical jobs has left their compensation\nmisaligned with the societal value they create.\nWhy are these jobs lagging the overall economic recovery today? Blame the pandemic for\nexacerbating existing challenges and introducing new ones:\nEven prior to the pandemic, these roles were demanding.\nCaregivers and educators are constantly on their feet. They have to be agile, patient and\nempathetic as they deal with unique needs from individuals who often don't want to be\nthere in the �rst place. They endure a high-stakes environment, with lives, well-beings and\nfutures on the line.\n\n\fThe pandemic turned the heat up further. Workers had to implement and enforce everevolving safety regulations. And they did so while putting their own health at risk, while\nothers worked from home. The stress continued once lockdowns lifted, as those they cared\nfor su�ered their own health issues, children returned with learning loss and behavioral\nissues, and families expressed varying views of appropriate protocols.\nAnd, of course, increased turnover and hiring challenges meant all the burden — old and\nnew — strained those who remained.\nAt the start of the pandemic, average hourly earnings\nfor workers at child care facilities were just $16.27. At nursing and residential care facilities,\nthat number was $19.39. Compare those to the economy's overall average earnings of\n$28.56.\nDuring the pandemic, wages went up across the board — including for these roles. But\ncompetition has remained �erce. Take child care. Wages improved in that sector — up\nalmost $3 to $19.09 — but not as much as wages increased elsewhere. A child care worker\ncould leave the sector for warehousing and storage and see average hourly earnings\nincrease another $3. So, this harder work got relatively less well paid.\nEven in jobs with higher relative wages, pandemic disruptions shaped new incentives. We\n�rst saw an increase in traveling nurses as COVID-19 hit di�erent areas of the country on a\nrolling timeline. But the increased use and compensation of travel nurses has incentivized\nmore to look at traveling as a higher wage alternative to the traditional career path.\nPrior to 2020, many of these jobs could have been thought of as\nmore secure than other occupations. They are the original essential workers. But in 2020,\nwhen nonurgent care was postponed, hospitals furloughed sta�. When lockdowns were\nput in place, day care centers shut down. Schools remained virtually open but suddenly\nrequired a whole new set of skills.\nAt the same time, other jobs became more attractive. They grew. Their compensation\nincreased. Work from home opportunities blossomed. Workers took note. The traditionally\nlow quits rate for health care and social assistance and for state and local education hit\nseries highs in 2021 and 2022.\n\nSome of these positions can't reprice easily. Local governments face constrained budgets\nand often need support from multiple stakeholders to adjust K-12 pay. The child care\nsector su�ers from razor-thin margins. Health care and elder care capacity depend on\nfunding decisions from Medicare and Medicaid.\nAdditionally, in�exibility is built into these roles. Most of these positions are in person and\nwork set hours. With the tight labor market o�ering an increase in hybrid jobs, it may be\nhard for employers to overcome the allure of less commuting and fewer challenging\ninterpersonal interactions.\n\n\fAcross these occupations, employers often need certi�ed and trained workers, and the\npipeline is not always wide enough to accommodate their needs. For example, there are\nlimits on how many nurses can be trained at a time, and their training takes exactly that —\ntime.\nThese obstacles aren't keeping communities and employers from trying. Some states are\nintroducing legislation to raise the minimum salary for teachers or child care workers.\nSome school districts are o�ering a�ordable housing options for educators and sta�. And\nhospitals and elder care facilities are exploring new incentives like signing bonuses, �exible\nscheduling and tuition reimbursement.\nWhether it's due to the demanding nature of these jobs, their in�exible wages or the notion\nthat the grass may be greener in other sectors, it's clear that there are real obstacles to the\nrecovery of these critical occupations. Perhaps the normalization of the economy will lessen\nemployers' stress by reducing the attractiveness of alternative careers. But we will have to\ndo some learning of our own this back-to-school season. Will supply and demand naturally\ncome back into balance? Will employer creativity on the work environment and bene�ts\nmake these �elds more attractive? Or will more funding — be it from governments,\nconsumers or others — be made available to reprice these jobs? Given the importance of\nthese jobs to the economy today and tomorrow, we need a path forward.\nData on nurses is drawn from the 1950 U.S. Census occupation data and the 2019 American\nCommunity Survey (ACS) 1-Year data. Public school data is drawn from the 1950 U.S. Census\nindustry data and 2019 Current Employment Statistics data. Child care and elder care data is\ndrawn from the 1950 U.S. Census industry data and 2020 ACS 5-Year data.\nThe nursing and residential care facilities sector includes but is not limited to nursing care\nfacilities and community care facilities for the elderly.

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nPrince William Chamber of Commerce\nPotomac Science Center - GMU\nWoodbridge, Va.\n\n• We are grappling with high, broad-based and persistent in�ation. It is worth asking:\nwhat happened?\n• It’s part COVID and supply imbalances. It’s part �scal. And it’s part monetary.\nMovements in any of these factors could have quieted in�ation somewhat. But I’m\nnot convinced any one of them is the whole story. For me, it’s the accumulation of so\nmany in�ationary pressures at once that likely tells the tale.\n• The question is how long this can last. Persistence is the essence of in�ation.\nBusiness leaders still see it as an episode, not a regime change. The water in the river\nmay be high but it hasn’t yet breached the dam the Fed built to keep in�ation\nexpectations in line with our 2 percent target.\n• In�ation should come down. But I don’t expect its drop to be immediate nor\npredictable. We’ve been through multiple shocks, and signi�cant shocks simply take\ntime to dampen.\n• The Fed has the tools to bring in�ation down and will persist until it does.\n\nThanks for having me. Today, I want to talk about the economy, but I also want to take a\nstep back and re�ect on how we got here and where we might be headed. These views are\nmine alone and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI think you all know where the economy is today. We’ve seen a historically strong recovery\nfrom the short but deep 2020 recession. GDP surpassed its pre-pandemic level in the �rst\n\n\fquarter of 2021. Employment did so in August of this year, and the unemployment rate has\nbasically come back to its low pre-COVID levels. While there is a lot of talk about a\nrecession, the strength of the labor market suggests that is still premature.\nBut, despite the good news that the worst of the virus seems behind us, we have not yet\nreturned to normal. Supply chains remain strained as �rms struggle to meet ever-shifting\nlevels of demand with unstable production capacity. Employers are short workers, partly\ndue to lower immigration and excess retirements. The war in Ukraine and widespread\ndrought conditions are a�ecting commodity supply.\nAnd, of course, for the �rst time in a generation, we are grappling with high, broad-based\nand persistent in�ation. The Consumer Price Index is at 8.3 percent. The Fed’s preferred\nmetric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, is 6.2 percent headline and 4.9\npercent core. Both are near 40-year highs.\n\nThe resurgence of in�ation is particularly noteworthy. Before the pandemic, we had\ndecades of remarkably low and stable in�ation. I give my Fed predecessors credit for that –\na lot of work went into reducing in�ation and stabilizing in�ation expectations.\nSo, it is worth asking: What happened? How did we end up in an in�ationary environment\nmost wouldn’t have imagined just three years ago? I thought I’d share my views, but I look\nforward to hearing yours as well.\nSupply Shocks\nI start with the main story of the past few years: COVID-19. The pandemic (and the\nresponses to it) unleashed a series of physical and human supply shocks that have pushed\nprices and wages up and lasted far longer than anyone anticipated.\nOn the physical side, lockdowns shifted spending from services to goods, especially those\nrelated to time at home. Then, reopening with a successful vaccine unleashed demand.\nManufacturers were unable to keep up; they struggled to forecast and to operate their\ncomplex supply chains. Transportation networks became overwhelmed. Houses were in\nshort supply. The services sector was plagued with supply shortages too: They couldn’t �nd\nenough chicken wings, popcorn buckets or replacement car parts.\nBoth the goods and services sectors also dealt with labor supply shocks. At �rst, the issue\nwas sick or quarantined workers. But the direct health impact was not the only problem.\nImmigration dropped. Child care and elder care responsibilities ballooned. Retirements\nwere pulled forward. Health fears stuck around. So, even once COVID protocols lifted, many\nbusinesses couldn’t operate at pre-pandemic capacity. Restaurant service is still an issue.\nAnd today, employers are struggling with productivity as they try to train new workers.\nBoth shocks have been surprisingly persistent. I thought as soon as vaccines were available,\nschools reopened and enhanced unemployment ended, people would return to the labor\nmarket. I thought chips would be in cars by now.\n\n\fI should probably also mention non-pandemic supply shocks, as there have been quite a\nfew. There was the severe winter storm in Texas, the �re at a chip plant in Japan, the ship\nlodged in the Suez Canal, the bird �u outbreak and then, in case things were feeling too\ncalm, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In normal times, each might have had only a �eeting\nimpact on in�ation. But during COVID, each piled on more price pressure.\nSo, supply shocks are clearly part of the story. But, as I’ll discuss further in a moment, the\nchallenges went beyond supply. For goods like durables, apparel and pet supplies, demand\nremains much higher than pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, in�ation has broadened\nbeyond supply chain-a�ected sectors; it now seems to be hitting virtually every single one.\nFor most of us, COVID seems e�ectively over and a number of these supply shocks have\npassed. If supply was the issue, why hasn’t in�ation settled by now?\nFiscal Fuel\nThat brings us to �scal policy. Six trillion dollars of stimulus was passed, fueling demand\nand limiting labor supply. Six trillion is a lot of money. It supported programs like stimulus\nchecks and eviction pauses. It supercharged demand, particularly from the segments of our\neconomy with the highest marginal propensity to consume. The PPP helped keep\nbusinesses a�oat, but it also sustained worker demand that might otherwise have dropped.\nAll these programs hit the economy at a time when the supply of labor and goods was\nconstrained.\nSome would additionally argue that ever-expanding �scal de�cits, on the watch of both\npolitical parties, are driving in�ation as well. Signi�cant de�cits run the risk of unanchoring\nin�ation expectations. If people believe government has lost its will to control spending,\nthey could conclude that it has no option but to in�ate its way out of its debt burden.\nSo, current and expected �scal spending is also part of the story. But while overall demand\nhas recovered, it is not elevated in total. Much of the stimulus hasn’t been spent. Americans\nstill have an estimated $1.5 trillion in excess savings, state and local governments still have\nbillions to tap and the infrastructure package will take years to roll out. So, it is hard to pin\nin�ation entirely on stimulus-fueled demand.\nMoreover, in�ation is global today. Other countries that did not pursue the same level of\n�scal response are still dealing with decades-high in�ation. The notable exception is the\nplace with one of the most prominent historic debt burdens: Japan.\nMoney, Money, Money\nWe need then to explore monetary policy and ask whether we would be witnessing this\nin�ation if the Fed had taken a di�erent approach. You won’t be surprised that I’ve spent a\nlot of time considering this question.\nSome point to the dramatic increase in the money supply. Since the start of the pandemic,\nin the context of government de�cits and asset purchases, M2 grew 40 percent. Milton\nFriedman famously said that (in the medium term), “In�ation is always and everywhere a\n\n\fmonetary phenomenon.” What other proof could we need?\nPaul Volcker started targeting the money supply in late 1979 but shifted to targeting\ninterest rates as a better policy just three years later. Financial innovation, among other\nforces, has made money velocity less stable and weakened the relationship between\nmoney supply, GDP growth and in�ation. We can see the velocity issue during COVID: M2\nvelocity fell approximately 25 percent in 2020 — not my de�nition of stability.\nIn the last recovery, when M2 increased nearly 46 percent between 2010 and 2015, we saw\n�ve-year in�ation fall from 2.2 percent to 1.4 percent. If money supply were the driving\nforce today, we would need to understand why it wasn’t back then.\nOthers argue the Fed was too expansionary for too long — that we were caught o� guard\nafter the prior decade of stubbornly low in�ation.\nWe believed in�ation was temporary, driven by the supply and demand factors discussed\nearlier. History taught us not to overreact to short-lived supply shocks — it usually doesn’t\nmake sense to constrain the economy to �ght a shock that will go away on its own. But\nin�ation didn’t fade as we had expected.\nTo be sure, we have learned something for future supply shocks. With perfect hindsight, it\nwould have made sense to have ended asset purchases and raised rates earlier. But sick\nworkers would still have had to stay home. Car manufacturers would still have been short\nchips. Russian oil and Ukrainian wheat supplies would still have been disrupted.\nIn theory, if monetary policy had been di�erent enough, perhaps it could have made a\ndi�erence. But how much faster would we have had to move to be in a demonstrably\ndi�erent place? Remember that in February 2021, 12-month in�ation was still at 1.7\npercent (PCE), nearly 8.8 million fewer people were employed than in February 2020 and\nunemployment was at 6.2 percent.\nHere, I think it is worth emphasizing another Friedman insight: Monetary policy works with\n“long and variable lags.” Our impact is more on the medium to long term than on the short\nterm. So, I take some solace from the fact that medium- and long-term in�ation\nexpectations remain relatively stable as we have now fully engaged in tightening.\nSo, those who are exhausted by in�ation can point �ngers in lots of directions. It’s part\nCOVID and supply imbalances. It’s part �scal. And it’s part monetary. Movements in any of\nthese factors could have quieted in�ation somewhat. But I’m not convinced any one of\nthem is the whole story. For me, it’s the accumulation of so many in�ationary pressures at\nonce that likely tells the tale. In football terms, we �ooded the zone.\n\nBefore I joined the Fed, I spent 30 years in business. At the Fed, I try to spend my time “on\nthe ground,” understanding how businesses and individuals experience the economy. So, I\nlook at all of this with a real economy lens.\n\n\fOver the past 40 years, in�ation stayed so low and so stable that price and wage increases\nbecame an all-but-abandoned lever. Price-setters lost con�dence they could pass costs on\nto customers; they focused on reducing their own costs instead. Firms employed\nsophisticated purchasing professionals to �ght suppliers hard on cost increases. Workers\ngrew to expect annual increases in a low and narrow range. In that era of price and wage\nstability, consumers, quite rationally, were inattentive to in�ation.\nNow we have seen these intense in�ation pressures accumulate and persist. Perhaps\nmagni�ed in an environment where news travels ever faster, they have moved short-term\nexpectations higher. Massive industry-wide cost pressures pushed suppliers to take the risk\nof passing cost increases on to customers. Supply shortages gave them con�dence they\ncould weather potential customer attrition. Purchasers, focused on resiliency rather than\ne�ciency, stopped objecting as much. Investors rewarded companies that passed price\nincreases on and penalized those more reticent. Consumers, funded by stimulus, mostly\naccepted price increases. Workers gained con�dence in this very tight labor market and\nnegotiated for �exibility or wage increases. Employers desperately adjusted to do what it\ntook to retain and recruit.\nIn short, businesses constrained by a generation of limited pricing power seized the\nopportunity that arose. Workers emboldened by unprecedented labor market tightness did\nthe same. We all started paying attention.\nThe question is how long this can last. Persistence is the essence of in�ation. When I talk to\nbusiness leaders, they still view their increased pricing power as temporary. They see it as\nan episode, not a regime change. To support that, with stimulus being drawn down, you\nhear more and more stories of consumers trading down or doing without. With recession\ntalk widespread, you hear of labor pressures easing (e.g., recent announcements on return\nto o�ce). Long-term market measures of in�ation compensation, derived from TIPS\nindices, remain in line with our 2 percent target despite short-term in�ation and in�ation\nexpectations at multidecade highs. The water in the river may be high, but it hasn’t yet\nbreached the dam the Fed built to keep in�ation expectations in line with our 2 percent\ntarget.\n\nWhat does this all mean for where in�ation is headed? First, note that no matter what\ntheory you have on in�ation, you are seeing promising signs.\nCOVID seems to be moving into the rearview mirror. Supply shocks are easing. An index\nmeasuring supply chain pressure from the New York Fed has fallen to its lowest level since\nJanuary 2021. Freight costs have decreased. Some large retailers have announced they are\noverstocked. Housing seems to be settling. Employers are having more hiring success;\nmore than 3.5 million jobs have been created since the start of the year. And over the last\nfew months, we’ve seen a broad range of commodities drop from peak pricing levels.\nInternational developments could further weaken commodity demand.\n\n\fFiscal stimulus has waned. The projected de�cit is expected to fall from 12.4 percent of GDP\nin 2021 to 3.9 percent this year (and 3.7 percent next year), according to the Congressional\nBudget O�ce. And we are seeing the extra savings amassed by consumers being spent\ndown. The personal saving rate has remained below pre-pandemic levels for over six\nmonths.\nFor those who still monitor the money supply, it has stayed nearly �at this year, increasing\njust over 1 percent.\nAnd the Fed is moving expeditiously. You’ve likely seen that we have raised rates 300 basis\npoints, started shrinking our balance sheet aggressively and signaled there are more rate\nincreases to come. The transmission of these changes, especially in interest-sensitive\nsectors, has been rapid. Look at mortgage rates, which in mid-September had more than\ndoubled from a year prior.\nSo, in�ation should come down. But I don’t expect its drop to be immediate nor\npredictable. We’ve been through multiple shocks, as I’ve discussed, and signi�cant shocks\nsimply take time to dampen. On the business side, I still hear �rms facing wage pressure,\nespecially for merit pay in the face of this year’s cost-of-living pressures. And while margins\nremain healthy overall, I've heard from many businesses still working to recover costs not\nyet passed through. On the consumer side, while lower-income consumers are facing\nstress, higher-income ones seem to be continuing revenge spending.\nOur rate and balance sheet moves take time to bring in�ation down. But the Fed will persist\nuntil they do. One of the key lessons from the ‘70s was not to declare victory prematurely.\nPerhaps we will get help from supply chain and energy market normalization. But we have\nthe tools to bring in�ation down, even if those disruptions continue. As we do, we should\nlearn even more about the drivers of this episode and how we can avoid any recurrence.\nBianchi, Francesco, and Leonardo Melosi. \"In�ation as a Fiscal Limit.\" Federal Reserve Bank\nof Chicago Working Paper No. 2022-37, August 2022.\nWhile in�ation in Japan has recently reached new highs, it is still relatively low compared to\nglobal levels.\nThis refers to the percentage change in the consumption velocity of M2 from February 2020\nto April 2020.\n\n\fIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\nTechnology Enabled Disruption Conference\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAtlanta, Ga.\n\n• The economy has seen a number of disin�ationary innovations in recent years.\nThese innovations put “the wind at our back” when it came to containing in�ation.\n• But we've been through quite a storm over the last two years, and it is appropriate to\nask whether anything has changed and if the wind has shifted in a more in�ationary\ndirection.\n• We’ve seen vulnerabilities associated with a globally complex supply chain,\ninvestments in renewable energy, and changing demographics that may shift labor\nfrom being abundant to being scarce, all of which could result in rising cost\npressures.\n• It’s possible that we could return to pre-pandemic wind conditions, but what if we\nare in a new era – one in which we face in�ationary headwinds?\n• Our goal, 2 percent target in�ation, wouldn’t change, nor would our longer-run ability\nto meet that goal, but the appropriate path to achieve it could.\n\nThanks to all of you for joining us in Atlanta today. We started this conference four years\nago, the year I joined the Fed after a 30-year business career. It’s hard to remember today,\nbut a core topic for the Fed back then was why in�ation had remained below our 2 percent\ntarget for so long. Along with Rob Kaplan and others, I thought real economic innovations\nwere playing an important role, which you could particularly see in over 20 years of goods\ndisin�ation. Today, as we are emerging from the pandemic with broad-based and high\nin�ation, I want to talk a bit about how I am updating my thinking on the relationship\nbetween technological innovation, the economy and monetary policy moving forward. As\n\n\falways, the views here are my own and not those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem or on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe economy has seen a number of disin�ationary innovations in recent years. Ecommerce grew signi�cantly over the last decade, lowering barriers to price comparisons\nand cutting costs for retailers. Fracking provided greater access to natural gas and oil,\nreducing energy prices. The procurement discipline became professionalized and\npressured suppliers to o�er ever-lower prices to �rms, thereby reducing costs to\nconsumers. Employers gained market power and used that to limit wage growth, as studied\nin the manufacturing sector by Richmond Fed economists. Automation reduced labor cost\npressures by increasing workforce productivity. And the rise of global supply chains\nenabled �rms to o�shore materials and services, lowering the cost of both products and\nlabor.\nWhether you loved these developments or hated them, these innovations – for any given\npolicy stance – put “the wind at our back” when it came to containing in�ation. But we've\nbeen through quite a storm over the last two years, and it is appropriate to ask whether\nanything has changed. Have the winds shifted in a more in�ationary direction, and if so,\nwhat are the implications?\nMuch has changed. Tari�s, the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed the\nvulnerabilities of globally complex supply chains. If countries and companies rethink their\ntrading relationships, we are likely to see higher costs and eventually higher prices.\nSimilarly, we may well see �rms reorient their procurement strategies to prioritize\nresiliency, not just e�ciency, resulting in higher ongoing cost pressures as well.\nInvestments in renewable energy and energy security could elevate costs too – at least\nduring the transition.\nAnd changing demographics, including lower birth rates, an aging population and\ndecreased immigration, may shift labor from being abundant to being scarce. While not\ntechnological in nature, these changes could give more power to workers to command\nhigher wages. We are also seeing labor productivity challenges as �rms struggle to �ll open\njobs and �nd their new hires require more training and support.\nAll that said, I don’t want to declare a long-term shift in the prevailing winds when we still\ndon’t know exactly how the pandemic era will play out. Some changes may reverse in time\n— countries and companies notoriously have short memories. And never count\ndisin�ationary forces out. The pandemic accelerated e-commerce, so maybe its\nenablement of price shopping will spread even faster. New technologies can always come\nalong in the way that fracking did. Pressure on labor could accelerate investments in\nproductivity, furthering technologies such as arti�cial intelligence and robotics. Remote\nwork — one of the themes of this conference — could increase the potential supply of\nlabor for certain jobs and thereby reduce wages. And as businesses con�gure to enable\nmore remote work, they might actually increase their openness to more o�shoring. Or\n\n\fperhaps government policies will deliver increased labor participation, as Japan has done to\nincrease the participation rates of older workers.\nSo, it is of course possible that we could return to pre-pandemic wind conditions. But what\nif we are in a new era — one in which we face in�ationary headwinds? What would that\ndisruption mean for our ability to meet our in�ation mandate? Our goal, 2 percent target\nin�ation, wouldn’t change, nor would our longer-run ability to meet that goal, but the\nappropriate path to achieve it could.\nWe would be more likely to face periods with real forces imparting near-term in�ationary\npressures. Consequently, history may be less of a precedent for appropriate policy. These\npressures could make “looking through” short-term shocks more di�cult. They could make\ngradual rate increase paths less e�ective. They could make market functioning\ninterventions somewhat trickier. As a result, our e�orts to stabilize in�ation expectations\ncould require periods where we tighten monetary policy more than has been our recent\npattern. You might think of this as leaning against the wind. Doing so would be consistent\nwith our �exible average in�ation targeting framework.\nCommunicating e�ectively could also prove more challenging. Over the last 10 years, our\nin�ation and employment goals have not been in con�ict while making policy. As such, the\nFed’s decisions have been relatively easy to explain. But in�ationary pressure could revive\nthe traditional Phillips curve trade-o� between employment and in�ation. We will need to\nbe crystal clear that a growing economy and maximum employment require stable prices\nand that we will remain committed to addressing in�ationary gusts.\nWe don’t need to make any of these judgments now. It is notoriously di�cult to pinpoint\nshifts in the weather, and the old joke is that economic forecasting was invented to make\nweather forecasters look good. The same could likely be said about predicting the next big\nthing in technology.\nTechnological innovations pop up every day and, in time, may well impact us in ways we\nhaven’t yet anticipated. That’s why the Richmond Fed continues to sponsor this conference\nand to dig into the impacts of technology-enabled disruption on the broader economy. To\nborrow from the conference theme, today is a great opportunity to learn from the\npandemic and evaluate the path ahead. Thanks for having me and enjoy the conference.\nChen Yeh, Claudia Macaluso, and Brad Hershbein, \"Monopsony in the US Labor Market,\" July\n2022.\n\n\fProduction and Investment\n\nIn�ation\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2022\n\n2022 Virginia Economic Summit and Forum on International Trade\nGreater Richmond Convention Center\nRichmond, Va.\n\n• Our economy has operated with a growing labor force for decades. This excess labor\nworld kept wages and bene�ts, and e�ectively cost-push in�ation, down.\n• That’s certainly not the world we �nd ourselves in now. And labor supply looks like it\nwill remain constrained.\n• Fewer workers would constrain our growth and pressure in�ation until businesses\nand governments can deliver productivity enhancements and/or structure incentives\nto bring more workers into the workforce.\n• Increasingly, I fear we are moving to an environment where labor is short, not long.\nThat situation can be managed, as other countries have proven, but it requires real\nintentionality.\n\nThe following text was prepared prior to the BLS Employment Situation release on December 2,\n2022.\nThanks for that nice introduction. As you know, the Fed’s dual mandate is to promote stable\nprices and maximum employment. Over the last year, that �rst goal – stable prices – has\nbeen front and center. But this is an economic development conference, so it seems right\nfor me to focus on the second part of the mandate today and talk about how we get our\neconomy to its full employment potential. I should note these views are mine alone and not\nnecessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s start with the workforce before COVID. It seemed amazingly healthy. We added jobs\nevery month after 2010. In the months before the pandemic, the unemployment rate hit\n\n\f50-year lows. And despite projections that demographics were working against us, labor\nforce participation kept improving as the strong labor market pulled people o� the\nsidelines.\nThen COVID hit. In a two-month span, we lost nearly 22 million jobs -- the deepest drop on\nrecord. The unemployment rate hit 14.7 percent in April 2020. Participation fell over three\npercentage points, to levels last seen in the early 1970s.\nBut the economy bounced back, supported by historic levels of �scal and monetary\nstimulus. Unemployment dropped and is now basically at pre-pandemic levels. Yet\nparticipation was slow to return. At �rst, that seemed to be due to sickness and\nquarantining, child care responsibilities, and enhanced unemployment bene�ts. But even\nonce the economy and schools reopened, vaccines rolled out, bene�ts ceased, and wages\nincreased signi�cantly, participation remained stubbornly below its pre-COVID levels.\nThe result has been unprecedented labor market tightness. Job openings have hit record\nhighs. Businesses have struggled to hold on to or �nd enough workers, especially in\nindustries with lower pay and less attractive jobs. This issue is particularly pronounced in\nskilled trades, like nursing or welding or truck driving. In November 2021, the quits rate\nreached a new record. In March, we reached two open jobs for every unemployed person.\nWe are not far from that high today.\nThis labor shortage has helped feed in�ation. The Personal Consumption Expenditures\nPrice Index is at 6.0 percent headline and 5.0 percent core, near 40-year highs.\nThe Fed has taken aggressive action to bring in�ation under control, raising the fed funds\nrate steeply to just under 4 percent and making clear our intent to do more. Even so, we\nhave seen labor demand continue to run ahead of supply.\nWe added 261,000 jobs in October, over two times the breakeven level of workforce\ngrowth. The unemployment rate was still at a historically low 3.7 percent. Despite recent\nnews from the tech sector, layo�s remain muted as businesses seem reluctant to shed\nworkers they have fought hard to hire. Wages in nominal terms were up over 14 percent\nfrom their pre-pandemic level and up 4.7 percent year over year. In the decade prior to the\npandemic, their growth averaged 2.4 percent. And participation? Participation hasn’t moved\nmeaningfully since the beginning of this year and last month moved to 62.2, well short of\nthe 63.4 percent of February 2020.\n\nOur economy has operated with a growing labor force for decades. We bene�tted from the\nbaby boom, from women more fully entering the workforce, from increased educational\nattainment making more people ready for more jobs, from better health allowing workers\nto work longer, and from historically high levels of immigration. All of these were\nsupplemented by access to ever growing pools of o�shore, low-cost labor.\n\n\fBusinesses adapted, as you might expect. They chose to hire from outside rather than grow\ntheir own; for example, the huge and attractive bank training programs of my era were\nlargely eliminated in the ’90s when banks realized the market had surplus bankers. Firms\ngot more comfortable with higher attrition sta�ng models, reoriented toward part-time\nwork and outsourcing, and became more willing to do layo�s rather than commit to job\nsecurity. They reduced retirement and health care bene�ts.\nThis excess labor world kept wages and bene�ts, and e�ectively cost-push in�ation, down.\nLabor share of income dropped. This was good for businesses and good for investors. It\nwas less good for the existing workforce.\nNow, there were many predictions over the last 10 years that as baby boomers aged, we\nwould see participation reverse its positive trend. But, as I said earlier, in the recent\nhistorically long upturn, we saw participation overperform. Perhaps the sheer duration of\nthat upturn brought hesitant people on the margin back to work. Or maybe the Great\nRecession forced near-retirees to work longer. Or perhaps the rise of certi�cate programs\nbetter connected workers to the workforce. And don’t forget the growth of the gig\neconomy. Regardless, the net was – despite some complaints at the end – labor was fully\navailable. Wage growth was relatively modest.\nThat’s certainly not the world we �nd ourselves in now.\nIt’s possible that labor force participation will recover — in time — to our pre-pandemic\nnormal. But what if it doesn’t? What if the aberration isn’t today but instead the abovetrend participation at the end of the last upturn? There are many reasons to think that\nmight be the case.\nThe growth of the working-age population is relatively straightforward to forecast, and\npredictions aren’t good. Fertility rates are down, and that trend would take a generation to\nreverse. My generation, the baby boomers, are aging out of the workforce, and the many\nretirements we saw during the pandemic are unlikely to come back. As of October, we were\nstill down about 1.4 million older workers. Immigration policy also looks unlikely to\nmaterially change any time soon. As of October, we were missing about half a million\nprime-age immigrants versus our 10-year pre-COVID trend. O�shoring has been\ncomplicated by increasing wages in developing countries and heightened awareness of the\nrisk of being dependent on foreign labor sources.\nAnd participation is clearly challenged too. COVID has had to have had some impact,\nespecially given the added pressure of child care and elder care. This seems most\npronounced for working class women, who may no longer be able to make the math work\nto stay in the labor force, and for the many recent retirees taking care of their parents,\nspouses or grandkids.\nSo, labor supply looks like it will remain constrained. And the Fed’s e�orts to bring demand\nback into balance won’t be easy when Americans still have about $1.3 trillion more in\nsavings than they did pre-pandemic and �scal stimulus continues -- for example, the\n\n\foutlays coming from the infrastructure package.\n\nFewer workers would constrain our growth and pressure in�ation until businesses and\ngovernments can deliver productivity enhancements and/or structure incentives to bring\nmore workers into the workforce.\nAs I travel my district, I hear many initiatives already underway to bring people o� the\nsidelines. I’ve talked to a steel company that invested in full-time recruiters and a tool\ndistributor that started its own soft-skills training program. I’ve talked to a poultry provider\nthat has widened the pro�les of who they are open to hiring, dropping drug tests and\nbackground checks. Employers are reconsidering working conditions, revising schedules\nand redesigning jobs to better match worker preferences. They are investing in\npartnerships with community colleges to better attract and develop skilled trades.\nParticularly intriguing have been initiatives to provide child care or housing support for\nemployees, taking a more active role in tackling barriers to work. I’m reminded of what\nused to happen in company towns the last time labor was this short in the early ’50s, when\nemployers attracted workers by investing in the broader environment, including housing\nand amenities.\nBut not all responses will be good for workers. I talked to a fast-food brand that described\nhow automation and robotics could reduce store sta�ng by half. Employers who pay more\nwill demand higher productivity or raise prices, thereby lessening demand and eventually\njobs. You are seeing lower service standards already, e.g., hotels lessening their cleaning\nprotocols or restaurants taking your order via QR code. We may see an increase in\no�shoring to markets without geopolitical pressures. All of these are particularly\nthreatening to the last people into the workforce who might �nd entry is more of a\nmountain to climb with entry-level jobs increasingly scarce.\nGovernments and nonpro�ts will want to think through how they approach this as well.\nConstrained longer-term economic growth isn’t good for our tax base, our competitiveness\nor our workers in the longer run. They should be exploring policies that work the supply\nside by encouraging workforce participation and preparation.\nCanada’s prime-age women’s participation grew over �ve points in the 20 years before the\npandemic, while the U.S. rate dropped nearly a full point. Research from the San Francisco\nFed points to parental leave policies in the two countries as a key di�erentiator. The same\nresearch highlights �exible work arrangements as a driver of increased women’s\nparticipation in other industrialized countries. And the two countries tax second earners\nmuch di�erently as well.\nSimilarly, between 2000 and 2019, the employment-to-population ratio for Japanese adults\nages 60 to 64 increased 19.3 percentage points to 70.3 percent. For context, the U.S. ratio\nwas 56 percent. Japan (where population is, to be fair, healthier) has pursued several\npolicies to increase employment of older workers, including subsidies and pushback\n\n\fagainst mandatory retirement ages. It has �elded a training program for employers on how\nto make jobs friendlier for older workers.\nThese ideas are worth exploring in the U.S. Additionally, it is worth exploring increased legal\nimmigration, bringing those with skills, work ethic and entrepreneurship into our\nworkforce. On participation, there could be signi�cant leverage in further investment in\neducation, job training, licensing capacity and rehabilitation, as well as in reimagining the\nchild and elder care industries and in exploring bene�t and tax policy changes that could\nincent further workforce participation.\nTo sum it up, COVID has caused businesses, governments and – yes – even economists to\nreassess their assumptions on the labor market. Increasingly, I fear we are moving to an\nenvironment where labor is short, not long. That situation can be managed, as other\ncountries have proven, but it requires real intentionality. With that, I welcome your\nquestions and comments.\n\nEmployment and Labor Markets\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",
