The U.S. economy could run out of fuel. We could experience\nunexpected turbulence. In�ation could level o� at a cruising altitude higher than our\n2 percent target. And the landing could be delayed as the U.S. economy continues to\ndefy expectations.\n• Is in�ation continuing its descent and is the broader economy continuing to �y\nsmoothly? Conviction on both questions will determine the pace and timing of any\nchanges in rates. There’s no autopilot. The data that come in this year will matter.\n\nThanks for that nice introduction. I really enjoy kicking o� the new year with an audience\nlike this. It gives me an excuse to re�ect on the prior year and a reason to lay out my\nperspective on the year ahead. So, that’s what I’ll try to do today. I caution these are my\nthoughts alone and not those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. I look forward\nto your questions and input.\nYou know the big picture. In�ation spiked coming out of the pandemic, and if there is one\nthing we’ve relearned in the last few years, it is that everybody hates in�ation. High in�ation\ncreates uncertainty. As prices rise unevenly, it becomes unclear when to spend, when to\nsave or where to invest. In�ation is exhausting. It takes e�ort to shop around for better\nprices or to handle complaints from unhappy customers. And in�ation feels unfair — the\nwage increase you earned feels arbitrarily taken away at the gas pump.\nThe Fed is the agency charged with keeping in�ation in line, so we stepped in aggressively.\n\n\fWe raised the federal funds rate over 5 percentage points in an 18-month period. We\nshrunk our balance sheet by over a trillion dollars. And we made crystal clear our resolve to\ndo what’s necessary to return in�ation to our 2 percent target.\nWe’re making real progress. Twelve-month PCE in�ation is down to 2.6 percent. Core is at\n3.2 percent. Six-month core in�ation is even lower, now just below our target at 1.9\npercent. Contrary to most predictions, the economy has remained healthy as in�ation has\nfallen. And that’s despite a number of shocks that could have proved destabilizing, like the\nbank turmoil in March or the escalation of the Gaza con�ict in October. GDP growth in 2023\nis estimated to be around 2.5 percent. The unemployment rate remains at a historically low\n3.7 percent. Frankly, if early last year you had o�ered me 2.6 percent in�ation and 3.7\npercent unemployment by year end, I would have taken it.\nFor sure, we got some help. Consumer demand has remained resilient, buoyed by excess\nsavings, strong employment, high asset prices and continued elevated demand for\nexperiences post-lockdown. Business investment has been supported by an AI-fueled data\ncenter boom and bills such as the CHIPS Act. The painful post-pandemic labor shortage\nmade employers reluctant to let workers go. And the supply side recovered nicely. Supply\nchain challenges eased. Domestic oil production rebounded. Prime-age labor force\nparticipation rose. And immigration stepped back up.\nNow, everyone is talking about the potential for a soft landing, where in�ation completes its\njourney back to normal levels while the economy stays healthy. And you can see the case\nfor that. Demand, employment and in�ation all surged but now seem to be on a path back\ntoward normal. GDP growth, which was 5.8 percent in 2021, is now estimated to be 2.5\npercent, closing in on its trend rate of just under 2 percent. Three-month average job\ngrowth, which hit 708,000 in 2021, is now 204,000, moving toward its breakeven pace of\nroughly 100,000. And in�ation, which was 7.1 percent in June 2022, is now at 2.6 percent,\ncoming into range of our 2 percent target.\n\nThe airport is on the horizon. But landing a plane isn’t easy, especially when the outlook is\nfoggy, and headwinds and tailwinds can a�ect your course. It’s easy to oversteer and do too\nmuch or understeer and do too little. I see four big �ight risks.\nFirst, the U.S. economy could run out of fuel. Last year, we raised rates to put the brakes on\nthe economy, but we didn’t end up losing as much altitude as we might have thought.\nCredit conditions tightened but didn’t make the economy stall.\nHowever, it’s easy to imagine the net impact of all this tightening will eventually hit the\neconomy harder than it has to date. As an example, I saw data suggesting that corporate\ninterest payments as a percent of revenue and household interest payments as a percent\nof disposable personal income have both now only gotten back to 2019 levels. These\nbene�ts from pandemic-era re�nancing and debt repayment won’t last long at current\ninterest rates. If consumers and businesses pull back, they could push the economy into a\n\n\fhard landing.\nSecond, we could experience unexpected turbulence. By nature, we can’t predict most shocks,\nwhen they hit or how hard. The economy is always vulnerable to geopolitical events, a\ncyber shutdown, unanticipated spillovers from troubled sectors or banks pulling back in\nforce. Such shocks could bring in�ation down but at a potentially large cost.\nThird, we could be approaching the wrong airport. The in�ation numbers have come down,\nbut much of the drop has been the partial reversal of pandemic-era goods price increases\nas the economy has normalized. Shelter and services in�ation remain higher than historical\nlevels, presenting a risk that in�ation levels o� at a cruising altitude higher than our 2\npercent target. As I talk to businesses, I still hear too many planning above-normal price\nincreases. After decades without pricing power, businesses, especially those facing margin\npressure, won’t want to back down from raising prices until their customers or competitors\nforce their hands. If that’s the case, I fear more will have to happen on the demand side,\nwhether organically or through Fed action, to convince price-setters that the in�ation era is\nover.\nYou may wonder whether a di�erent destination — say 3 percent in�ation — would be\nacceptable. The answer is no. Credibility is the Fed’s key asset. Changing the target before\nreaching it risks that credibility. You can’t expect people to keep boarding planes if they\ncan’t trust where the planes are going.\nFinally, the landing could be delayed. The U.S. economy continues to defy expectations.\nConsumer spending accounts for over 68 percent of the economy, and it is hard to make a\ncase for a pullback so long as equity values are high and the labor market remains as tight\nas it is. Longer-term rates have dropped recently, which could stimulate demand in\ninterest-sensitive sectors like housing. While you might think this would be a �rst-class\nproblem, strong demand isn’t the solution to above-target in�ation. That’s why the\npotential for additional rate hikes remains on the table.\nSo, a soft landing is increasingly conceivable but in no way inevitable.\nIf we do see the economy weaken, it’s worth remembering that not all slowdowns are\ncreated equal. We’ve been scarred by our memories of the Great Recession and the Volcker\nRecession, but they were particularly long and deep.\nAs the airlines folks might say, this time there’s foam on the runway.\nA slowdown could bring less dislocation in the labor market. Businesses tell me that hiring\nhas become easier, but no one is eager to let go the front-line workers they fought so hard\nto �nd. Latent demand might mean a slowdown would have less of an impact on spending,\nas customers who had to put o� purchases due to price and supply constraints �nally have\nthe opportunity to buy. And a slowdown wouldn’t catch anyone by surprise, as businesses\nhave been planning for a downturn for nearly two years. They slowed hiring, streamlined\ncosts, managed inventory levels, and deferred investment. Banks cut back on marginal\ncredit. If a slowdown does come, the economy should �nd itself less vulnerable.\n\n\fThe FOMC’s December meeting got a lot of attention. We acknowledged the progress on\nin�ation and explicitly rea�rmed our willingness to hike if necessary. We also submitted\nour quarterly forecasts, which showed that FOMC participants expect in�ation to settle\nwithout additional hikes. In that context — in which our forecasts are right and in�ation\ndoes in fact continue to settle — most of us forecasted rate normalization to begin\nsometime this year. But the range of estimates was pretty wide, from no cuts to as many as\nsix.\nI would caution you to focus less on the rate path and more on the �ight path — is in�ation\ncontinuing its descent and is the broader economy continuing to �y smoothly? Conviction\non both questions will determine the pace and timing of any changes in rates.\nTo close, I will note that there’s no autopilot. And the data that come in this year will matter.\nSo, I can’t give more guidance from the �ight deck. Forecasting is di�cult, and conditions\nare ever evolving. As they do, so too will our approach. So, buckle up. That’s the proper\nsafety protocol even if you expect a soft landing.\nThanks, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nBusiness Cycles\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home / News / Speeches / Thomas I Barkin / 2024\n\nThe Economic Club of New York\nThe University Club\nNew York, N.Y.\n\n• Contrary to most forecasts (including mine), the progress on in�ation has come while\nthe economy has remained healthy.\n• I spend a lot of my time talking to businesses across the Fifth District. With the\nexception of interest-sensitive sectors like banking and real estate, the tone has\nshifted decisively away from talking about a recession.\n• You might ask: Why not “declare victory”? While demand, employment and in�ation\nare all on a good path, there is no certainty where they are headed.\n• Looking forward, I am hopeful but still looking for more conviction that the slowing of\nin�ation is broadening and sustainable.\n• Given robust demand and a historically strong labor market, we have time to build\nthat con�dence before we begin the process of toggling rates down.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here today. I thought I would speak\nabout the economy and where we may be headed. I caution you these are my thoughts\nalone and not necessarily those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nThe recent data have been remarkable. Twelve-month PCE in�ation is at 2.6 percent. Core\nis down to 2.9 percent. Six-month and even seven-month core in�ation are even lower, just\nbelow our target at 1.9 percent. The 12-month numbers will almost assuredly get even\nbetter over the next �ve months, as we cycle over last year’s in�ationary winter and spring.\nAt the same time, contrary to most forecasts (including mine), the progress on in�ation has\n\n\fcome while the economy has remained healthy. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7\npercent. On Friday, we added another 353,000 jobs. And GDP growth in the last quarter of\n2023 was an impressive 3.3 percent. If you had told me a year ago we would end 2023 with\n2.6 percent in�ation and 3.7 percent unemployment, I would have taken it.\nAs you may know, I don’t like to depend solely on published data. I spend a lot of my time\ntalking to businesses across the Fifth District. And there, too, I’m hearing good news. With\nthe exception of interest-sensitive sectors like banking and real estate, the tone has shifted\ndecisively away from talking about a recession. They may not be hiring as much, but they’re\nnot �ring either. And while price-setters continue to try, they seem more and more\nconvinced that price increases will be smaller, less frequent, and less likely to stick. I take a\nlot of signal from the major consumer products manufacturers. In their most recent\nearnings reports, I was happy to see their realized price increases have �nally moderated,\nfrom double digits a year ago to low single digits today.\nSo now the phrase “soft landing” enters every conversation, suggesting a scenario where\nin�ation returns to our 2 percent target while the economy stays healthy. That could well\nhappen. If so, it would defy almost all predictions of what would happen when the Fed\nraised interest rates so quickly to �ght in�ation. And it would be even more surprising given\nthe challenges we faced last year, from the banking turmoil in the spring to the con�icts in\nUkraine and the Middle East.\nOne can explain why in�ation is settling quickly without much disruption. The extraordinary\nlevels of post-pandemic spending have been normalizing. The painful post-COVID-19 supply\nchain shortages have been largely resolved. The rebound in prime-age labor force\nparticipation and immigration have helped alleviate labor market pressures. And most\nmeasures of in�ation expectations have stayed impressively stable, suggesting that\nbusinesses and consumers have found the Fed and our in�ation target credible. In other\nwords, they likely understood the in�ation surge was temporary, and that with the help of\nFed action, it is now behind us.\nYou might ask: Why not “declare victory” and move rates back quickly to neutral levels? Let’s\nbe clear that nothing would make me happier than a return to the pre-pandemic economy.\nBut there are two reasons for caution.\nFirst, the plane has not landed yet. For the nerds among us, I like the visual of an un�nished\nnegative parabola, with the top being the peak of the pandemic recovery. Annual GDP\ngrowth, which was around 2 percent pre-pandemic, hit 5.8 percent in 2021 and is now\ndown to 2.5 percent in 2023, closing in on its trend growth rate around 2 percent. Threemonth average job growth, which was 214,000 before COVID-19, hit 727,000 in 2021 and is\nnow 289,000, still above the replacement rate of about 100,000. And in�ation, which was\njust under 2 percent before the pandemic, rose to 7.1 percent in June 2022 and is now at\n2.6 percent, on its way back to our 2 percent target. While demand, employment and\nin�ation are all on a good path, there is no certainty where they are headed. A demand\npessimist could point to monetary policy lags, credit tightening, the narrowness of job\n\n\fgains, and the potential for geopolitical shocks and worry about a downturn. An in�ation\npessimist could point to continued strong wage growth and the recent drop in interest\nrates as fueling reacceleration.\nThe Fed is committed to returning in�ation all the way to 2 percent. As I think about that\ncommitment, I can’t help but look to lessons from the past. History tells many stories of\nin�ation head-fakes. For example, at the end of the Volcker era, in�ation seemed to settle\nin mid-1986. The Fed reduced rates. But in�ation then escalated again the following year,\ncausing the Fed to reverse course. I would love to avoid that roller coaster if we can.\nMy second reason for caution is more fundamental. There is an old saying that no one\nreturns from battle unchanged. And, while our wars on COVID-19 and in�ation can’t\ncompare to the horrors of actual war, I’m still wondering how these experiences may have\nchanged our economy. Disruptive events can have lasting consequences; for example, GDP\nnever returned to the pre-crisis trend after the Great Recession.\n\nWhat changes worry me?\nThe labor market certainly has changed. With labor force participation down, employment\nremains more than 4 percent under its pre-COVID-19 trend. My generation, the baby\nboomers, is aging out of the workforce, and its participation has dropped as well. The\nmarket was tight before the pandemic and remains even tighter today. As evidence, wage\ngrowth — as measured by the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker — is still running at 5.0\npercent versus 3.7 percent pre-pandemic. This pressure on wages, and potentially prices, is\nlikely to persist.\nThe housing market has also changed. We lack housing supply — a topic I detailed in a\nspeech late last year. We underconstructed for a generation, and the shortage of skilled\ntrades workers and recent increase in construction costs haven’t helped. We also saw\ndemand increase. With interest rates low and work shifting partly to home, people looked\nfor new places to live. After all, nothing makes you more aware of the �aws of your current\nresidence (or roommate) than spending every waking moment at home. Institutional\ninvestors added to demand, as did second-home purchasers. Housing prices shot up\nacross the board. The market has since cooled somewhat, but with limited supply, prices\nremain high. If housing supply continues to be short, that could mean further pressure on\nprices and rents in coming years.\nAnother change could be deglobalization. COVID-19 laid bare the vulnerabilities associated\nwith globally complex supply chains. Businesses and consumers became painfully aware\nthat a series of unfortunate events — a severe winter storm, a �re at an overseas plant, or\na blocked shipping lane — could snowball into snarled supply chains, goods shortages, and\na spike in costs. We are seeing countries rethink their trading relationships and �rms\nredesigning their supply chains to prioritize resiliency, not just e�ciency. These changes\nwould suggest higher costs and less ability for intermediaries to drive year-over-year\n\n\fe�ciencies. These forces could well put renewed pressure on goods prices.\nLooking forward, I am hopeful but still looking for more conviction that the slowing of\nin�ation is broadening and sustainable. Much of the in�ation drop thus far has come from\nthe partial reversal of pandemic-era goods price increases. Shelter and other services\nin�ation remain higher than historical levels. Now, the Fed is not in the game of picking the\ncorrect makeup of in�ation; our target doesn’t specify how the price of individual items\nshould change, just that the price index overall should increase by 2 percent over time. But\nthe factors I discussed could hinder the continued de�ation in goods and maintain\npressure on shelter and services prices. A recent rebound in consumer sentiment,\ncontinued willingness of consumers to dip into savings, and loosening of �nancial\nconditions could also introduce risk to the in�ation outlook. One could dismiss all these\npressures as exerting only a �eeting impact on in�ation in an otherwise stable\nenvironment, but I fear they could still in�uence expectations, unsettled by the recent\nin�ationary experience. The New York Fed’s in�ation uncertainty measure remains much\nhigher than pre-pandemic levels.\nSo, it’s possible that we will return to the pre-pandemic economy pretty seamlessly. It is\nalso possible that the landing might be somewhat bumpier, with continued in�ation\npressure or demand challenges that we will need to counteract.\nThat’s why I think it is smart for us to take our time. You likely have seen in last week’s\nmeeting that we acknowledged that risks to employment and in�ation are moving into\nbetter balance and stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to cut rates until we\ngain greater con�dence that in�ation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. No one wants\nin�ation to reemerge. And given robust demand and a historically strong labor market, we\nhave time to build that con�dence before we begin the process of toggling rates down.\nThanks.

I thought I would speak\nabout the economy and where it may be headed, and then look forward to your questions\nand input. I caution you these are my thoughts alone and not necessarily those of anyone\nelse on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fContrary to most forecasts, including my own, the economy �nished 2023 strong. Twelvemonth PCE in�ation came down all the way to 2.6 percent. At the same time, despite higher\ninterest rates, global con�icts and banking turmoil, the economy remained healthy, with\nGDP at 3.4 percent and unemployment near historic lows at 3.7 percent. If you had told me\na year or two ago that we would end 2023 with a robust economy and in�ation in the 2s, I\nwould have been pretty happy.\nBut early 2024 data has been a little less encouraging. The �rst two months of PCE in�ation\nhave come in higher, at a 4.3 percent annual rate. And consumer spending, which is nearly\n70 percent of GDP, has come in softer, at 1.3 percent annualized growth over the �rst two\nmonths. There are reasons to underweight some of the recent data, including seasonal\nadjustments and winter weather, but it does raise the question of whether we are seeing a\nreal shift in the economic outlook, or merely a bump along the way.\nWhen trying to interpret uncertain data, I �nd there is one sure�re place to �nd perspective\n— and that’s a Peanuts comic strip. As greeting card buyers know, there really is a Peanuts\nmessage for every occasion. I remember one in which Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus are\nlooking at the clouds — the same clouds — and seeing completely di�erent things. Linus\nsees the pro�le of a painter, a map of a Central American country, and a scene from the\nBible. Charlie Brown sees a “horsie” and a “ducky.”\nThat’s where we are. We are all looking at the same data, but it is easy to come away with\ndi�erent conclusions. So, I thought today I could walk through di�erent ways to look at the\nnumbers, and then give my own perspective. I’ll do my best to channel the sophistication of\nLinus, but you may still see me as Charlie Brown.\nSome of you may be optimists and see the proverbial “soft landing” in the clouds, where\nin�ation returns to our 2 percent target while the economy remains healthy. You might be\nencouraged by the progress seen over the last year. The extraordinary levels of postpandemic spending have been normalizing. The painful post-COVID-19 supply chain\nshortages have been largely resolved. The rebound in prime-age labor force participation\nand recent high levels of immigration have helped alleviate labor market pressures, as have\nproductivity increases perhaps from automation and arti�cial intelligence. Most measures\nof in�ation expectations have stayed impressively stable, suggesting that businesses and\nconsumers have found the Fed’s action and our in�ation target credible. Or you might\nsimply look at the data with a longer lens and gain comfort from 12-month in�ation at 2.5\npercent while three-month job gains remain at a robust 265,000.\nAlternatively, you might see more daunting shapes in the clouds.\nYou might be a demand pessimist. Monetary policy works with a lag, and you might take\nsignal from the recent increase in consumer delinquencies and the challenges in\ncommercial real estate. You might worry about weakness in other interest-sensitive sectors\nas well, like banking, residential real estate, manufacturing and home improvement. You\nmight note that nearly three-quarters of last year’s job gains came from just three sectors\n\n\f— health care and social assistance, leisure and hospitality, and government — and worry\nthat the labor market might be nearing a turning point. Or perhaps the risk of geopolitical\nshocks keeps you up at night.\nAlternatively, you might be an in�ation pessimist. You might point to continued strong\nwage growth in a tight labor market. The Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker is still at 5\npercent, above the February 2020 level of 3.7 percent. You might note consumers’\ncontinued willingness to spend, driven presumably by their healthy personal balance\nsheets: the saving rate is down to 3.6 percent versus 7.7 percent pre-pandemic, and that\nspending is potentially supporting higher prices. Or maybe you notice shifting macro forces,\nwhich arguably have turned in�ationary, from deglobalization, to limited housing supply, to\ndemographics, to energy transition (to the recent weather-driven escalation in cocoa\nprices).\nLastly, you might be a Fed pessimist. You might fear the Fed will keep rates too high for too\nlong or normalize too quickly and allow in�ation to linger. Our job isn’t easy, and history\nteaches that most tightening cycles end poorly, though often heavily in�uenced by an\noutside event like the pandemic or the 1990 Gulf War.\nWhat do I see?\nOn demand, the historic strength of today’s labor market makes a strong case that we are\nnot in a recession today, but I have to believe all this tightening will eventually slow the\neconomy further. After all, corporate interest payments as a percent of corporate revenues\nand personal interest payments as a percent of disposable personal income have only now\n�nally gotten back in the range of 2019 levels, suggesting the full impact of higher rates is\nyet to come.\nIf the economy does cool, it doesn’t need to be as painful as the Great Recession. A\nslowdown this time could bring less dislocation in the labor market. Employers who have\nfought hard to recover from labor shortages tell me they are hesitant to lay people o� and\nrun the risk of being short again. And a slowdown shouldn’t catch businesses by surprise,\nas they’ve been planning for a downturn for two years. They’ve already slowed hiring,\nstreamlined costs, managed inventories, and deferred investment. Banks have cut back on\nmarginal credit. If a slowdown does come, the economy should �nd itself less vulnerable.\nOn in�ation, while I do hear price-setters increasingly convinced that the era of signi�cant\npricing power is behind them, the in�ationary experience of the last two years has surely\ngiven them more courage to use price as a lever. So, I’m still looking for the slowing in\nreported in�ation to sustain and broaden. Before the pandemic, 26 percent of the PCE\nbasket had increases greater than 3 percent year-over-year. Today, that has more than\ndoubled to 54 percent. Much of the in�ation drop thus far has come from the partial\nreversal of pandemic-era price increases on certain goods; in�ation in both shelter and\nservices remains higher than historical levels. Now, the Fed is not in the game of picking the\ncorrect makeup of in�ation. Our target metric is simply the overall price index. But the risk\n\n\fis that as price decreases on goods normalize, continued shelter and services in�ation will\nleave that overall index higher than our target.\nDespite my concerns about demand and in�ation, perhaps it is no surprise that I’m a Fed\noptimist, which is di�erent than believing we are infallible. I am optimistic that keeping\nrates somewhat restrictive can bring in�ation back to our target. While I don’t see the\neconomy overheating, the Fed knows how to respond if it does. And, if the economy slows,\nthe Fed has enough �repower to support it as necessary.\nIn the interim, I think it is smart for the Fed to take our time. At our last meeting, the Fed\nacknowledged that risks to employment and in�ation are moving into better balance and\nstated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to cut rates until we gain greater\ncon�dence that in�ation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent target. No one wants\nin�ation to reemerge. And given a strong labor market, we have time for the clouds to clear\nbefore beginning the process of toggling rates down.\nThanks.

And given a strong labor market, we have time to gain\nthat con�dence.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here today. I thought I would speak\nabout the economy and where it may be headed, and then I look forward to your questions\nand input. I caution you these are my thoughts alone and not necessarily those of anyone\nelse on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nContrary to most forecasts, including my own, the economy �nished 2023 in a good place.\nHeadline in�ation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price\nindex, dropped all the way to 2.6 percent by year-end. For the �nal seven months of the\nyear, annualized core PCE came in just under our 2 percent target. At the same time,\ndespite higher interest rates, global con�icts, and banking turmoil, economic growth was\nhealthy at 3.4 percent, and unemployment remained near historic lows.\nBut early 2024 in�ation data has been disappointing to those who thought that the in�ation\n\n\f�ght was behind us. In the last three months, quarter-over-quarter core PCE in�ation rose\nto 3.7 percent annualized. Headline rose to 3.4 percent. That number, fortunately, is\nnowhere near the 7.1 percent headline in�ation we saw in June 2022 but does remind us\nthat the job is not yet done.\nDemand remains robust. While the headline �rst quarter GDP number came in lower at 1.6\npercent, it was held down by the volatile categories of imports and inventories. Private\ndomestic �nal purchases, a better underlying measure, came in strong, growing at 3.1\npercent. The labor market, too, has remained remarkably resilient. We’ve created 246,000\njobs per month on average in 2024, and the unemployment rate remains low at 3.9\npercent. In fact, unemployment has come in below 4 percent for 27 consecutive months\nnow — the �rst time that has happened since the late ’60s.\nData matter for policy, and with this data whiplash over the last few months, it is natural to\nwonder whether we are experiencing a real shift in the economic outlook, or merely one of\nthe bumps we said we expected along the way. Should we take more signal from the past\nthree months, or the prior seven?\nAs I have traveled my district, I hear lots of views on where we are. I thought I might share\nthe four I hear the most, then o�er my own view. I look forward to your questions at the\nend and hope you’ll o�er your own additions to this list!\nFirst, I still talk to lots of optimists. Encouraged by the progress made over the last year,\nthey expect the economy to stay healthy and in�ation to continue its decline to 2 percent,\neven if slowly. After all, the extraordinary levels of post-pandemic spending have been\nnormalizing. The painful post-COVID-19 supply chain shortages have been largely resolved.\nThe labor market feels far less tight: the rebound in prime-age labor force participation and\nrecent high levels of immigration have helped alleviate labor market pressures, as have\nproductivity increases perhaps arising from automation and arti�cial intelligence. Most\nmeasures of in�ation expectations have stayed impressively stable, suggesting that\nbusinesses and consumers have found the Fed’s actions and our in�ation target credible.\nOptimists point to 12-month core in�ation continuing to decline, down 10 basis points from\nthe beginning of the year to 2.8 percent, and ask, “Why not celebrate declining in�ation and\na healthy economy?”\nNow, of course, not everyone is an optimist. I speak to three types of pessimists: demand\npessimists, in�ation pessimists, and Fed pessimists.\nDespite the strength of today’s economy, demand pessimists believe the real impact of\nmonetary policy and credit tightening is still to come. They worry about the recent\nincreases in consumer delinquencies and the challenges in commercial real estate. They\nsee weakness in other interest-sensitive sectors as well, like banking, residential real estate,\nmanufacturing, and home improvement. They note that nearly three-quarters of last year's\njob gains and over 60 percent of this year’s came from just three sectors — health care and\nsocial assistance, leisure and hospitality, and government — and are concerned that job\n\n\fgrowth may soon begin to fade. And recent events in the Middle East are a reminder not to\nignore the risk of geopolitical shocks.\nIn contrast, in�ation pessimists focus on the strength in the economy, and its potential to\npressure prices. They point to continued strong wage growth in a challenging labor market,\nespecially for skilled trades like construction or nursing. The Atlanta Fed Wage Growth\nTracker is still at 4.7 percent, above the February 2020 level of 3.7 percent. They note\nconsumers’ continued willingness to spend, driven presumably by healthy personal balance\nsheets. The saving rate is down to 3.2 percent versus 7.7 percent pre-pandemic. Many\nmention other forces that have arguably turned in�ationary, from deglobalization to limited\nhousing supply to demographics to energy transition.\nFinally, I also hear from Fed pessimists. They fear the Fed will keep rates too high for too\nlong or normalize too quickly and allow in�ation to linger. Our job isn't easy, and history\nteaches that most tightening cycles end poorly, though often heavily in�uenced by an\noutside event like the pandemic or the 1990 Gulf War.\nWhat do I see?\nOn demand, the historic strength of today’s labor market makes clear we are not in a\nrecession today, but I have to believe all of this tightening will eventually slow the economy\nfurther. With consumers and businesses alike sheltered from higher interest rates thanks\nto pandemic-era debt paydowns and re�nancing, their aggregate interest burden is not yet\nhistorically elevated. To me, that suggests the full impact of higher rates is yet to come.\nIf the economy does cool, it doesn't need to be as painful as the Great Recession. A\nslowdown this time could bring less dislocation in the labor market. Employers who have\nfought hard to recover from labor shortages tell me they are hesitant to lay people o� and\nrun the risk of being short again. And a slowdown shouldn't catch businesses by surprise,\nas they’ve been planning for a downturn for over two years. They've already slowed hiring,\nstreamlined costs, managed inventories, and deferred investment. Banks have cut back on\nmarginal credit. In short, the economy should be less vulnerable.\nOn in�ation, while I do hear price-setters increasingly convinced that the era of signi�cant\npricing power is behind them, the in�ationary experience of the last two years has surely\ngiven them more courage to use price as a lever. Before the pandemic, 26 percent of the\nPCE basket had increases greater than 3 percent year-over-year. Today, that has more than\ndoubled to 58 percent.\nHere's what I’m hearing: For a generation, in the context of low and stable prices, powerful\nretailers, global low-cost supply, and e-commerce-enabled comparison shopping, pricesetters came to believe they had virtually no chance to successfully increase prices. But,\nduring the pandemic’s supply chain cost and availability challenges, price-setters concluded\nthey had no choice but to try to pass on these costs. When they did, they found no\nconsequences. Customers paid. Volumes were hardly impacted.\nNow? While the era of no consequences is over, we certainly aren’t back to the pre-pandemic\n\n\fno chance world. Businesses are still looking to push prices if they can, even if it takes\ngetting creative in segmenting their customer base and product o�erings. Their mentality\nis: There’s no crime in trying — no crime in trying to recover margins, protect margins, or\nenhance margins. And they simply are more con�dent using price as a lever, and I\nanticipate they will only back down when customer elasticity again sends a strong message\nthat price-setters have no chance.\nArguably that signal has registered in goods like apparel and furniture. Most of the in�ation\ndrop thus far has come from the partial reversal of pandemic-era goods price increases,\nbut in�ation in both shelter and services still remains higher than historical levels. Now, the\nFed is not in the game of picking the correct makeup of in�ation. But the risk is that as we\nget less help from the goods sector, continued shelter and services in�ation will leave the\noverall index higher than our target. That’s what we’ve seen so far this year.\nDespite my concerns about demand and in�ation, perhaps it is no surprise that I'm a Fed\noptimist. I am optimistic that today’s restrictive level of rates can take the edge o� demand\nin order to bring in�ation back to our target. While I don't see the economy overheating,\nthe Fed knows how to respond if it does. And if the economy slows more signi�cantly, the\nFed has enough �repower to support it as necessary.\nIn the interim, the recent data whiplash has only con�rmed the value of the Fed being\ndeliberate. The economy is moving toward better balance, but no one wants in�ation to\nreemerge. We have said we want to gain greater con�dence that in�ation is moving\nsustainably toward our 2 percent target. And given a strong labor market, we have time to\ngain that con�dence.\nThanks.

Even in that\ncontext, I don’t think it is controversial to say that the last few years have proven\nparticularly challenging for forecasts.\n• The U.S. economy, particularly its consumer, has been much more resilient to rate\nincreases than most expected. Most anticipated we would be cutting rates by now,\nbut that has not yet been the case.\n• I do believe there are still lags playing out — and that all this tightening will\neventually slow the economy further.\n• I’m open to the idea that r-star has shifted up somewhat. It is too soon to tell, but\nthere’s one way to �nd out: proceed deliberately while keeping a close eye on the\nreal economy. That’s what I am doing.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction and for having me here today. It has been over two\nyears since central banks around the globe began our e�orts to rein in in�ation. I thought\ntoday I could spend some time looking back at what’s happened in the United States during\nthat period, and then look forward to what might lie ahead. Let me caution that these are\nmy thoughts alone and not necessarily those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nBy the �rst quarter of 2022, the Fed’s preferred in�ation measure — the personal\nconsumption expenditures price index (PCE) — had climbed to 6.6 percent, more than\ntriple our 2 percent in�ation target. Demand was surging, too. Nominal personal\n\n\fconsumption growth was nearly 12 percent in that quarter, over three times the average\ngrowth seen in the prior decade. The Fed needed to take aggressive action, and we did. In\nMarch 2022, we kicked o� our steepest tightening cycle in decades, raising the federal\nfunds rate over 500 basis points in under 18 months. In parallel, we have also reduced our\nbalance sheet by over $1.7 trillion.\nTo most observers, the implications of our aggressive actions were straightforward. High\nrates would bring down in�ation, but with unavoidable side e�ects: a pullback in demand\nand an increase in unemployment. You can see those expectations in the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters from the fourth quarter of 2022. The median respondent\nexpected the economy to slow considerably; GDP growth in 2023 was expected to be 0.7\npercent — well below trend — and unemployment was expected to rise above 4 percent.\nThe median forecasted that in�ation would come down quickly to 2.9 percent by the end of\n2023 and to near target (2.3 percent) by the end of 2024. Based on the November 2022 fed\nfunds futures curve, markets forecasted that rates would peak at 4.89 and be down to 4.11\nby the second quarter of 2024.\nIt’s fair to say most of those expectations have not played out. We didn’t end 2023 with\nsluggish economic growth. Quite the contrary: GDP grew 3.4 percent annualized in the\nfourth quarter of 2023, well above trend. Private domestic �nal purchases suggest this\nyear’s �rst quarter growth has continued to be robust. The unemployment rate remains\nlow at 4 percent. It has now been at or below 4 percent for 30 consecutive months, the\nlongest streak since the ’60s. In�ation came down as expected in 2023 to 2.8 percent by the\nfourth quarter, but surprised high in the �rst quarter of 2024, running at a 3.4 percent\nannualized rate. And, as you well know, the fed funds rate rose to 5.33 percent and, in the\ncontext of stubborn in�ation, has not yet begun to come down.\nSo, let’s talk about what happened. Why were forecasts o�? Well, we should start by\nacknowledging that it is notoriously di�cult to predict where the economy is headed. The\nold joke is that economic forecasting was invented to make weather forecasters look good.\nEven in that context, I don’t think it is controversial to say that the last few years have\nproven particularly challenging. In the aftermath of the pandemic, many of the economy’s\nregularities did not play out as expected.\nI’ll walk through four areas today — economic activity, labor, in�ation and rates — and\ndiscuss what the regularities suggested would occur, what we saw, and the factors that\ncould explain the divergence between the two.\nStarting with economic activity: Soon after the Fed began hiking, recession indicators began\n�ashing. The yield curve inverted in the summer of 2022, a warning sign that has preceded\nthe last eight recessions. It has stayed inverted now for two years. The Conference Board’s\nindex of U.S. leading indicators began to signal recession in 2022 and continued to do so\nuntil this year. But no recession has materialized. Don’t get me wrong: Some sectors, such\nas banking, commercial real estate and housing development will tell you that they\n\n\fcertainly have experienced a recession. But overall, despite higher rates, banking turmoil\nand geopolitical challenges, the U.S. economy has not seen a broader slowdown. Why have\nthese traditional signals missed the mark?\nSome question the signals themselves. Was the yield curve forecasting a slowdown, or was\nit simply forecasting that success over in�ation would allow us to reduce rates? Do the\nleading indicators, �rst identi�ed two generations ago, continue to accurately represent\ntoday’s services-intensive economy?\nOthers look beyond the signals to the unique nature of this consumer-led recovery.\nConsumers make up nearly 70 percent of U.S. GDP and their strength, to put it simply, has\nbeen remarkable. At �rst, the story was the excess savings accumulated early in the\npandemic; consumers spent less during lockdowns and brought in more via federal\nstimulus checks. But even as those funds have been drawn down, consumers have\ncontinued to spend. How can they a�ord to? Asset values are up. The S&P 500 index is up\nnearly 70 percent over the end of 2019. Home values are up nearly 50 percent over the\nsame time period. Real wages have increased, especially for entry-level workers.\nUnemployment is low. In short, feeling wealthier and more stable, consumers seem to be\ncomfortable spending more and saving less. The saving rate is now 3.6 percent, less than\nhalf of what it was pre-pandemic.\nBut it isn’t just consumers. The rise of AI has spurred investment in data centers. Fiscal\nspending, via investments in infrastructure and in our semiconductor industry, is helping\nsustain construction demand. After years of underinvestment in homebuilding following\nthe Great Recession, high post-pandemic housing demand has supported new home\nconstruction, especially as existing housing stock froze due to locked-in low mortgage rates.\nRelatedly, consumers and businesses alike have been sheltered from rising interest rates\nthanks to pandemic-era re�nancing and debt paydowns.\nSo, the U.S. economy, particularly its consumer, has been much more resilient to rate\nincreases than most expected and is likely to stay so as long as valuations remain elevated,\nand unemployment remains low.\nThat brings us to the labor market. The expectation was that workers would pay a price for\nthe Fed’s steep rate path. Yet, here we are, still adding 248,000 jobs per month on average\nthis year. The pessimistic forecasts aligned with what economists call the Beveridge Curve,\na downward sloping curve that depicts the relationship between open positions and the\nunemployment rate. As policy constrained labor demand (and thus caused open positions\nto decline), unemployment was expected to rise.\nYet, two years into our tightening cycle, open positions have dropped signi�cantly for over a\nyear, and unemployment has barely budged. Why might the Beveridge Curve have turned\nvertical? Part of the explanation is what is often called “labor hoarding.” Having just spent\ntwo years desperately trying to �nd and retain workers, �rms have thus far been reluctant\n\n\fto let workers go.\nIn addition, sectors that had lagged behind in the pandemic recovery had a lot of catch-up\nto do. Even as demand faded in some sectors, three sectors — leisure and hospitality,\ngovernment, and health care and social assistance — took up the slack. Nearly threequarters of last year’s job gains and about two-thirds of this year’s have come from just\nthose three sectors.\nNet, the labor market got so far behind during the pandemic, that it has taken a lot of labor\ndemand reduction just to return it to “tight.” Skilled trades like nursing, construction and\nmanufacturing remain in short supply. I recently visited a county in my district that\nsupports over 17,000 workers. About a year ago, one of its largest manufacturers\nannounced a sudden closure, laying o� over 1,000 workers. It seemed like a potential\ncalamity. Yet a year later, the unemployment rate there is stable and low at 3.1 percent.\nThe regional labor market is just that tight.\nIn�ation, of course, has been our intense focus. The expectation — in the context of our\naggressive rate moves, forecasts of slow growth, and the stability of long-term in�ation\nexpectations — was for in�ation to fall relatively quickly back toward our target. In reality, it\nhasn’t been a smooth path down. By the end of 2023, we were well on our way to target. At\nthe beginning of this year, our progress took a step back. And now, in the most recent\nmonths, progress seems to have resumed. Why is in�ation proving so stubborn?\nIf you consider the surprise strength in demand and in the labor market, it is actually quite\nnotable that in�ation has come down as much as it has. We have the supply side to thank.\nSupply chain issues have largely been resolved, enabling a partial reversal of pandemic-era\ngoods price increases. A boost in domestic energy production has helped keep energy costs\nin line. Increases in immigration and a surge in prime-age labor force participation have\nhelped alleviate labor market pressures. And we may well also be seeing a move up in\nproductivity, driven perhaps by automation or even AI.\nBut we still have work to do. Before the pandemic, only 26 percent of the PCE basket had\nannual increases over three percent. In the most recent data, that number has more than\ndoubled, to 58 percent.\nPart of my role as a Federal Reserve Bank president is to talk to businesses in my region to\ngather economic insights. What I hear in those conversations is that the behavior of a\nnumber of price-setters has changed. For a generation, in the context of low and stable\nprices, powerful retailers, global low-cost supply, and e-commerce-enabled comparison\nshopping, many price-setters came to believe they had virtually no chance to successfully\nincrease prices. But, during the pandemic’s supply chain cost and availability challenges,\nmost concluded they had no choice but to try to pass on these costs. When they did, they\nfound no consequences. Customers paid. Volumes were hardly impacted.\nNow? While the era of no consequences is over, we certainly aren’t all the way back to the\n\n\fpre-pandemic no chance world. I talk to many businesses still looking to push prices if they\ncan, even if it takes getting creative in segmenting their customer base and product\no�erings. Their mentality is: There’s no crime in trying — no crime in trying to recover\nmargins, protect margins or enhance margins. And they simply are more con�dent using\nprice as a lever. I anticipate these price-setters will only back down when customer\nelasticity �nally sends a strong message that they once again have no chance.\nOne could argue that message has been sent in most goods sectors, and that’s why\nin�ation for goods has returned to pre-pandemic norms. But services and shelter still have\na way to go.\nI’ll close by discussing rates. Most anticipated we would be cutting rates by now, either\nbecause we returned in�ation to target, or perhaps because the economy took a turn for\nthe worse. Yet, in contrast to the European Central Bank, that has not yet been the case.\nMonetary policy famously works with “long and variable lags.” One possibility is that those\nlags have simply been longer than expected, thanks to many of the factors I discussed\nearlier — labor hoarding, excess savings, delayed exposure to interest rate hikes, newfound\npricing power and the like.\nAnother explanation is that our rate hikes aren’t constraining the economy as much as we\nthink. Some economists point to r-star, the neutral real rate of interest, and wonder\nwhether it hasn’t shifted to a higher level. They might point to the recent apparent pickup in\nproductivity growth, the waning of the Chinese export surplus (and related decline in global\nsavings) or ballooning federal de�cits as reasons behind such a shift. The Lubik-Matthes\nmodel, produced by the Richmond Fed, falls in this camp, and has seen r-star increase from\nclose to zero in the 2010s to a touch above 2 percent now, suggesting a long-run policy rate\nclose to 4 percent. Such a rise in the rate would, of course, mean policy is not as restrictive\nas one might have thought.\nAs for me, I do believe there are still lags playing out — and that all this tightening will\neventually slow the economy further. At the same time, given the remarkable strength we\nare seeing in the economy, I’m open to the idea that r-star has shifted up somewhat. It is\ntoo soon to tell, but there’s one way to �nd out: Proceed deliberately while keeping a close\neye on the real economy. And that’s what I am doing.\nSo, to close, what can we learn from this experience? First, the pandemic was unique.\nLockdowns, extraordinary levels of stimulus, a reopening surge in spending, supply chain\noutages, aggressive monetary policy, and the like all contributed to a novel environment\nthat our economic models weren’t ready to handle. Second, regularities — like the yield and\nBeveridge Curve indicators — can send false signals; they’re not fate written in stone. And\n�nally, agility is key. Forecasts, as we emphasize with each release of the Summary of\nEconomic Projections, are made with the information available in that moment.

This cut\ncame largely because of the progress we’ve made on in�ation.\n• At times, in the past, the FOMC has made such a signi�cant rate cut in response to a\ntroubled economy. Happily, that is not the case today.\n• I see our September decision as a recalibration to a somewhat less restrictive stance.\n• Victory means di�erent things to di�erent people, and — while we have made real\nprogress — there remains signi�cant uncertainty on both in�ation and employment.\n• As we decide how fast to move and how far to go during this rate reduction cycle, we\nare just going to need to be attentive and learn as we go.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. I thought today I might talk about how I see the\neconomy and where it may be headed. I’ll then turn it over to you, and I look forward to\nyour questions and comments. I should caution that these are my thoughts alone and not\nnecessarily those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nAs you’ve likely seen, the FOMC cut the fed funds rate 50 basis points at our September\nmeeting. This cut came largely because of the progress we’ve made on in�ation. Twelvemonth headline PCE in�ation is now 2.2 percent, well down from its peak of 7.1 percent in\nJune 2022. Core is at 2.7 percent. Near-term in�ation expectations are back in line with our\n2 percent target. If we look at the most recent data, the in�ation picture is even better:\nThree-month core in�ation is only slightly above target at 2.1 percent. Importantly, the\n\n\fdecline in in�ation appears to be broad-based, not just limited to goods as we had seen\npreviously.\nConsumers are driving this drop. Frustrated by high prices, they have become increasingly\nprice conscious. They’re still spending, but they’re choosing: trading down from beef to\nchicken, from sit-down restaurants to fast casual, from brand names to private label.\nThey’re waiting for promotions: opting for the $5 value meal at McDonald’s or jumping on\ndiscounts at Target. This is how it is supposed to work! The old saying is that the solution to\nhigh prices is high prices. And that’s what we are �nally seeing. Their choices are pressuring\nprice-setters to �nally moderate price increases.\nAt times, in the past, the FOMC has made such a signi�cant rate cut in response to a\ntroubled economy. Happily, that is not the case today. As in�ation has moderated,\neconomic activity has remained robust. GDP came in at 3 percent in the second quarter, a\nmore than healthy growth rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent\nof GDP, has risen at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent in the last two months, supported by\nlow unemployment, higher real wages and high valuations. Thanks in part to this strong\nspending, the U.S. economy has returned to its pre-pandemic GDP trend, a feat that we\nnever achieved after the Great Recession and that most other advanced economies can’t\nclaim.\nThe labor market has remained in good shape as well. We’ve added an average of 116,000\njobs over the last three months. Unemployment has ticked up but remains low at 4.2\npercent, near most estimates of its natural rate. Given how overheated the labor market\nwas just a few years ago, some normalization was to be expected.\nWhy did the FOMC reduce rates so signi�cantly if we are not seeing a troubled economy or\nweak labor market? I see our September decision as a recalibration to a somewhat less\nrestrictive stance. After over a year at a 5.3 percent fed funds rate, headline in�ation had\ncome down closer to target while unemployment was near its natural rate. The number\nthat now seemed out of sync was the fed funds rate, which no longer needed to be as\nrestrictive given the progress that’s been made. Going forward, the median member of the\nFOMC forecasted another 50 basis points in cuts this year, assuming the data come in as\nexpected. This dial back in restraint just takes a little bit of the edge o�.\nI assume many of you were happy to see us start to bring rates down. But please\nremember that our focus has never been on the rates themselves but on in�ation. High\nrates are merely a tool to get in�ation under control, and I’ve been glad to see that we have\ndone so with limited collateral damage to date.\nDoes this cut signal that we are declaring victory? Let me start with some history. “Let’s\ndeclare victory and go home” is a pretty cynical phrase traced back to the 1960s, when Sen.\nGeorge Aiken proposed that the United States should call Vietnam a win and begin to deescalate, regardless of the realities on the ground. As an aside, it’s never good to adopt a\nstrategy from the Vietnam era.\n\n\fSo, I’m not yet con�dent nor cynical enough to declare victory. I’ll walk through three\nreasons:\nFirst, victory means di�erent things to di�erent people. I talk to many people for whom\nvictory would be returning to 2021 interest rates or to pre-pandemic price levels. Both\nwould be challenging absent a signi�cant recession, which I venture to say would not be a\nwin. Some de�ne victory as a stock market that continually moves up, but of course, we\ncan’t and don’t seek to control the stock market. And you may yearn for the stability of the\n2010s, when GDP and employment grew consistently and in�ation barely moved. That\ndecade, however, was unique in recent history. So declaring victory seems bound to\ndisappoint.\nSecond, there is still work to do on in�ation. While down from its high, in�ation remains\nabove our 2 percent target. I don’t expect 12-month core in�ation to drop much further\nuntil 2025, as we are still lapping low in�ation numbers from late last year.\nForecasting in�ation going forward is challenging. On the positive side, we may continue to\nget help from supply-side factors like immigration, increased labor force participation and\nproductivity, as well as from global factors like disin�ation coming from China and\nincreased energy production. Last I saw, per-barrel oil prices were down in the $70s. On the\nother hand, I just got my homeowner’s insurance renewal, and it reminded me that\nin�ationary pressures have not fully disappeared. Recent union actions or a pullback in\nlabor supply could drive higher wages. Health care cost trends could raise premiums\nfurther. Deglobalization could increase import prices. The con�ict in the Middle East could\nworsen.\nI am paying particular attention to the potential impact of our recent rate move on pricing\nfor houses and cars. Buyers will welcome lower rates, but there is a risk that demand is\nstimulated in excess of available supply. Remember, it takes time to get new houses built\nand move cars onto lots. Locked-in homeowners may well start to list their homes as\nmortgage rates drop, but these sellers will also be buyers, increasing demand while they\nare adding to supply.\nSo it remains di�cult to say that the in�ation battle has yet been won.\nA third reason not to declare victory is risk to the labor market. The levels, as I mentioned,\nlook healthy, but the trends bear watching. Job gains are being continually revised down,\nand those sectors (like health care) that have been catching up from pandemic shortages\nare moderating their growth. In fact, the hiring rate has dropped down to 2013 levels. But\nwhile employers aren’t hiring, they also aren’t �ring: The layo� rate is near 25-year lows and\ninitial claims remain muted. Cautious employers are allowing head count to drift\ndownward, but largely through attrition. I hear very few employers planning layo�s (and\nlayo�s do take planning).\nThis low hiring-low �ring environment is unlikely to persist, but again I could make a case\nthat it could evolve in either direction. Of course, a cycle of layo�s could start given pro�t\n\n\fpressures and the excess sta�ng many have chosen to keep after their pandemic-era\nshortages. But demand remains healthy and lower rates could add momentum. Those\nemployers running lean could well �nd themselves short again, particularly if labor force\ngrowth starts to slow. At some point you have to hire to serve your customers.\nYou might notice that I’m wearing a suit, not a “mission accomplished” bomber jacket. It’s\nnot that I’m particularly humble (or formal). I’m just realistic. Victory means di�erent things\nto di�erent people, and — while we have made real progress — there remains signi�cant\nuncertainty on both in�ation and employment. And while we are working hard to deliver\nfor the U.S. economy, we almost certainly won’t get it perfect. Perfection would be a high\nbar when we operate in an environment fraught with uncertainty, under a mandate\nrequiring trade-o�s, with a primary tool — the federal funds rate — that works with long\nand variable lags and without a �nish line. So as we decide how fast to move and how far to\ngo during this rate reduction cycle, we are just going to need to be attentive and learn as\nwe go. I’m hoping to start that process with your questions and comments today.\n\nBusiness Cycles\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nIn�ation\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nReceive an email noti�cation when News is posted online:\nBy submitting this form you agree to the\n\nEmail Address\n\nSubscribe\n\n\f(804) 697-8956\n(804) 332-0207 (mobile)\n\n© 1997-2024 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\n\f",
