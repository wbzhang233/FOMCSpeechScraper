            "content": "Reflections on 40 Years at the Central Bank\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJanuary 18, 2023\nThe Exchequer Club of Washington, D.C.\nWashington, D.C.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for the invitation to speak today.\nIn a few days, I will be stepping down from my post as president of the Kansas City Fed,\nhaving reached mandatory retirement, concluding a Fed career of more than 40 years. It has been\nan honor to serve the nation’s central bank and to represent a region that includes all or part of\nseven states: Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico\nThere is much to appreciate about working for the Federal Reserve, certainly including its\ndedicated workforce. These talented people who say yes to working at the Federal Reserve on\nbehalf of the public feel the weight of the institution’s mission and its impact on every American.\nAnd, during times of crisis, they are prepared to step up in extraordinary ways.\nBecause the Federal Reserve’s actions affect people’s financial and economic situations,\nit is often in the headlines, including criticism, scrutiny and second guessing. One point of\ncriticism has been the Fed’s structure, with 12 independent regional district banks\ncomplementing the Board of Governors in Washington. Some view the Fed’s decentralized\nstructure as an outdated, reflecting a time when transportation and technology were far less\ndeveloped. Others argue accountability would be enhanced by altering the authorities of the\nregional Reserve Banks in favor of more central authority with the Federal Reserve Board.\nCurrent ideas about changing the Fed include reducing the number of regional Reserve Banks\nfrom 12 to 5, making Fed presidents political appointees, and requiring congressional access to\nReserve Bank records, including confidential supervisory information and sensitive personnel\ninformation. The tug-of-war, targeting reform of the central bank’s regional structure,\ngovernance, and authority, is not a new one. It has been in play since the Federal Reserve’s\nfounding.\nIn my comments this afternoon, I’ll talk about the Federal Reserve from the perspective\nof a career central banker in the nation’s heartland, focusing on issues related to policy\ndeliberations, community banking, and the nation’s payment systems. Through this lens, I’ve\nwitnessed the ways the Federal Reserve’s structure has figured prominently in securing the\npublic’s trust as it carries out its mandated objectives.\nTrust and Confidence\nOne of the most unique and important aspects of the Federal Reserve’s decentralized\nstructure is the participation of the American public in the ongoing operations of the 12 Reserve\n1\n\n\fBanks. The Tenth Federal Reserve District extends from the plains of the Midwest to the Rocky\nMountains. Energy, agriculture, transportation and logistics are dominant economic drivers. You\ncan drive hours through parts of the Tenth District and never see an office tower. (I apologize for\nbragging, but I love our wide-open spaces.)\nBy virtue of its design as part of a federated system, the public is able to engage directly\nwith the Kansas City Fed and its branch offices by serving on our boards of directors and\nadvisory groups. The governance of the regional Reserve Banks involves individuals from each\nDistrict who oversee the Banks’ operations and provide economic insights that inform monetary\npolicy deliberations.\nOur boardrooms are places where a labor leader and manufacturer; banker and non-profit\nexecutive; tribal leader and energy CEO, sit side by side. For a Fed policymaker, these\ndiscussions are obviously valuable. Not only do our directors provide fiduciary oversight and\nimportant insights on economic and financial conditions, but they create a level of engagement\nand understanding that would not otherwise exist. These are thoughtful discussions that may\nencompass topics ranging from the nuances of monetary policy to how economic conditions may\nbe affecting nonprofit donations or certain segments of the workforce. My colleagues and I often\nreference what we’ve learned from these interactions as part of FOMC deliberations or in our\nspeeches where they can provide important real-world examples of the economy.\nA few weeks ago, I attended year-end board meetings at each of our Kansas City District\noffices. During those meetings, we also recognized the directors who were concluding their\nterms of Fed service. At these meetings in Kansas City, Denver, Oklahoma City and Omaha, I\nlistened to these individuals describe their experiences of being invited inside our organization to\ngovern and to offer their insights and advice. Over the course of their terms, they’ve learned\nwhat we do, and why. They know that we check politics at the door and that our motive is to\nlisten and learn, so that we can understand and do our work on behalf of the public we serve.\nVery often, they tell us that this service has introduced them to people and perspectives that they\nwould otherwise not have experienced. For me, these were strong reminders of the central bank’s\ndeep connections with a variety of Americans.\nThe structure of the Fed was no accident.\nCongress had already established two central banks that were unable to secure the\npublic’s trust, and their charters were not renewed. What went wrong? The First and Second\n2\n\n\fBanks of the United States were isolated in what was then the national power center of\nPhiladelphia, and with governance structures that did not reflect the system of checks and\nbalances found in other important national institutions. Congress was keenly aware of these\napparent shortcomings as it considered a third attempt to form a central bank. This time, the\ndesign moved away from a highly centralized institution with concentrated authority in favor of a\ndecentralized system that would share authority across the nation. 1\nThe Federal Reserve System reflects a blended structure of public oversight by the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors over 12 quasi-privately chartered regional Reserve Banks.\nThese regional Reserve Banks and their affiliated branches have the obligation and the\nopportunity to meaningfully engage with the American public within each of their designated\nDistricts.\nWhen creating the first central bank of the United States, Alexander Hamilton was\nparticularly concerned that a more politically controlled bank would prove to be an enticing tool\nfor manipulation by interests who would favor short-term political gain over long-term national\nstability. 2 Decades later, the Federal Reserve’s governance and structure proved effective as the\nFOMC under the leadership of Chair Paul Volcker responded to high inflation. It is hard to\nimagine a scenario where a more politically controlled central bank would have been willing to\ntake the very difficult and painful measures that ultimately proved necessary to restore economic\nand price stability for the nation. 3 Today, the U.S. is again experiencing high inflation and the\nFederal Reserve is aggressively tightening monetary policy. And, once again, the benefits of\ncentral bank independence are apparent.\nThe Fed’s system of checks and balances includes the FOMC structure that has been in\nplace since the mid-1930s. Only five Reserve Bank presidents are voting members of the FOMC\nat any one time, leaving the seven publicly appointed Fed Governors in a majority position. This\narrangement promotes a diversity of views and healthy debate about policy options. In fact, an\nobserver wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between voters and nonvoters in any of the\ndiscussions because everyone participates equally in the meeting until the vote is taken.\nTodd, Timothy.

Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.\n2011.\n1\n\n3\n\n\fJust as monetary policy deliberations reflect the value of a decentralized central bank, the\nregional structure plays a key role in the Federal Reserve’s bank supervision and payments work.\nCommunity Banking\nThe characteristics of the financial system have changed significantly over the past 40\nyears. Banking consolidation and concentration has resulted in a handful of Globally\nSystemically Important Banks—referred to as GSIBs; a small number of mid-sized banks; and,\nfewer, although still thousands of, small banks. 4 Another notable change in the landscape is that\nnonbank financial services providers have increasingly captured a large share of the retail\nbanking business.\nThere are no GSIBs headquartered in the Tenth Federal Reserve District. Instead, there\nare hundreds of regional and community banks. Across the region, households, small businesses\nand agricultural producers rely heavily on local banking firms to supply credit and deposit\nservices. The business models, economic conditions and banking needs of a farmer in rural\nKansas or Nebraska differ significantly from those of a hotel owner in Jackson, Wyoming, a real\nestate developer in Denver, an entrepreneur in New Mexico, a nonprofit in Missouri or an\noilfield services company in Oklahoma City.\nAs a supervisor of these banks, the Federal Reserve’s understanding of these unique\ncustomer needs and local economic conditions benefits enormously from its regional structure\nand engagement. Regional Reserve Banks also work closely with state banking regulators to\nfulfill supervisory mandates.\nCommunity bankers serve on regional Reserve Bank boards and advisory councils to\ninform our understanding of local economies, the financial services landscape, and concerns of\nconsumers and communities across the country. Through this engagement, we also gain insights\nto the challenges facing these institutions as they provide access to credit in their communities.\nMuch as the profiles and business models of banks differ, so do the risks presented to the\nfinancial system. Too often, our banking regulations have lacked the nuance to fully account for\nthe differences in risk posed by small and regional banks compared to their larger peers and non-\n\nHanauer, Matt.

As a result, the compliance costs and burden affecting small\nbanks can be outsized relative to the benefits to financial stability and fair access to credit.\nFinding the right calibration in today’s supervisory framework will be necessary to\nensure that community banks do not bear a disproportionate regulatory burden and can remain\ncompetitive as they meet the credit needs of the communities they serve. As I’ve noted in other\nremarks, opportunities exist to further develop risk-focused approaches to supervision, to better\ntailor capital requirements, and to provide clearer guidance around innovation and alternative\nbusiness models. These steps might better balance the costs of regulation with its benefits.\nUnfortunately, I am not optimistic that the legislative aims of ending too big to fail will\nserve to bring more stability and prosperity to communities that depend on small banks. The\nnation’s largest banks continue to grow larger while holding less capital. 5 At the same time,\nconsolidation among smaller banks is likely to continue, as regulatory burden persists in a\ncompetitive landscape of unregulated providers offering a variety of banking services. These\ntrends are not likely to be benign for small businesses and communities across the country.\nThe Payment System\nFinally, the regional Reserve Banks have long played an important role in supporting the\nvarious ways Americans pay for goods and services. As Congress undertook the task of\ndesigning a central bank for the United States in 1913, it was clear that lawmakers intended for\nthe new institution to assist in improving the performance of the nation’s payment system. The\nday before the Federal Reserve Act was signed, Representative Carter Glass of Virginia\ncompared the flow of payments in the economy to “highways of commerce.” He used the\nmetaphor to illustrate how the Federal Reserve, through a number of regional Reserve Banks\nlocated across the country would provide currency to fuel the economy and serve as the hub of a\nnational clearing network for checks. 6\nSince then, the nation’s payments system has evolved dramatically. Electronic payments\nhave flourished, and households and businesses have grown accustomed to paying for things\nusing mobile phone apps, as well as credit and debit cards. While the marketplace responded\nPellerin, Sabrina. “Bank Capital Analysis Semiannual Update.” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City. 2014.\n5\n\n5\n\n\fwith new ways to meet this customer demand, the “highways” on which these payments travel\nhad not been updated, meaning it can take as much as a few days to get access to your money.\nIn 2019, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors approved the development of a new\nservice to modernize the nation’s payment infrastructure. Known as FedNow, this service will\nenable payments to be made instantly and available anytime, including holidays and weekends.\nAs they have historically, the regional Reserve Banks will operate the FedNow service,\npromoting the payment system’s accessibility, safety and efficiency. By making funds available\nimmediately, consumers can pay utility bills and rent, split the tab at a restaurant or rent\npayments with roommates, and small business owners will be able to pay their suppliers.\nImmediate access to funds could be particularly important for those on fixed incomes or living\npaycheck to paycheck.\nImportantly, the Federal Reserve’s role will ensure equitable access to banks of all sizes\nnationwide by operating a real-time service for faster payments alongside the existing privatesector system. Public commenters have noted the importance of safety in faster payments,\nhighlighting the Federal Reserve's record of resiliency, especially during periods of stress. This\nnew retail payment infrastructure will support competition, decrease market concentration, and\nprovide a neutral platform for innovation.\nConsistent with its public mission, the launch of the FedNow service later this year\nrecognizes that everyone deserves the same ability to make and receive payments immediately\nand securely, and that every bank deserves the same opportunity to offer that service to its\ncommunity. FedNow will give banks of every size in every community across the country the\nopportunity to provide real-time payments to their customers. 7\nConclusion\nThrough the compromises and choices made in designing the Federal Reserve System,\nCongress created a durable and credible public institution. Alongside the Federal Reserve Board\nof Governors, comprised of public officials nominated by the president and confirmed by the\nSenate, regional Reserve Banks were distributed across a dozen geographic Districts to carry out\n\nBrainard, Lael. “Delivering Fast Payments for All.” Speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Town\nHall, Kansas City, Mo. Aug. 5, 2019.\n7\n\n6\n\n\fthe System’s operational functions, to be responsive to regional economic and financial\nconditions, and to participate in monetary policy deliberations.\nFederal Reserve officials are asked to make decisions in the long-run best interest of the\nAmerican public. Sometimes those decisions can be unpopular. As innovation and structural\nchange reshape the economic landscape, all of us who work at the Fed understand that our policy\ndecisions must take into consideration long-run public benefit and stability. Every decision and\naction must take into account potential unintended consequences. This is a powerful argument\nfor central bank independence.\nAcross the regional Federal Reserve Bank offices that help policymakers traverse a vast\ngeography, and in the meeting rooms at the Federal Reserve Board here in Washington, the\nAmerican public has the opportunity to interact every day with the central bank in ways that can\nbuild trust.\nAnd at the end of the day, trust really is our only product.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "Heterogeneity and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nNovember 22, 2022\nDelivered at “Heterogeneity in Macroeconomics: Implications for Monetary Policy”\n25th Annual Conference of the Central Bank of Chile\nSantiago, Chile\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fThank you to Governor Costa and to the organizers for the invitation to participate in this\nconference about heterogeneity and macroeconomics. The consideration of differences across\nindividuals, industries, and geographies within an economy is particularly relevant for\npolicymakers today as central banks around the world confront high inflation and tighten policy.\nAs the depth of research at this conference suggests, the study of heterogeneity and\nmacroeconomics is a rich and active field. Models incorporating heterogeneity are necessarily\ncomplex, but as this conference has highlighted, progress has been made in recent years. That\nsaid, and perhaps as a consequence of the complexity of the models, the importance of\nheterogeneity can often appear to be overlooked in macroeconomics. In my experience as a\ncentral banker, regardless of the state of the academic literature, it has long played an important\nrole in policymaking and continues to do so today.\nFrom the perspective of the United States, one could argue that the structure of the\nFederal Reserve System itself is recognition of the importance of heterogeneity. In establishing\n12 distinct regional banks, the Federal Reserve Act recognized that it was important to monitor a\ndiversity of conditions across the nation and to ensure that a range of communities were\nconnected to the central bank. Monetary policy can affect industries and populations differently,\nand for a country like the United States, which has a history of skepticism surrounding\ncentralized authority, it is critical for diverse regions of the country to have a voice in the making\nof policy.\nThe benefits of a central bank that is engaged with diverse stakeholders are also evident\nin the Federal Reserve’s focus on local and targeted outreach and engagement with communities\nacross the country. For example, at the Kansas City Fed we hold regular symposiums,\nroundtables, and advisory group meetings with representatives from diverse industries,\ngeographies, and cultural and economic backgrounds. Perhaps most well-known have been our\nFed Listens events where the Federal Reserve welcomes voices from a wide range of\norganizations — unions, small business owners, residents of low- and moderate-income\ncommunities, Native American leaders, and others — to hear how monetary policy affects them\nand their local communities. In addition, each Reserve Bank is governed by a Board of Directors\nthat is representative of the range of community, business, and labor interests in their region. It is\nat this regional level where the central bank builds trust and enhances communication in ways\n\n1\n\n\fthat resonate across a range of audiences. In this regard, heterogeneity is central to the way the\nFederal Reserve operates.\nI will focus today on two additional aspects of heterogeneity and monetary policy. First,\nhow it affects the conduct of monetary policy, as distributional differences obscured by\naggregate measures can be important for how we interpret the data and inform policy decisions.\nAnd second, how the conduct of monetary policy can affect heterogeneity, as monetary policy\ncan have distributional consequences by affecting different segments of the population with\nvarying intensity.\n\nThe Importance of Looking Within Aggregates\nStarting with the importance of heterogeneity in the conduct of monetary policy, let me\noffer a very real and current example from the United States’ experience. During the pandemic,\nthe United States adopted an extraordinary fiscal stimulus, roughly $6 trillion, a large proportion\nof which consisted of direct transfers to households and businesses. Relative to previous\nprograms, the pandemic stimulus was distributed widely across the economy and, consequently,\nled to a sharp improvement in household balance sheets, with households estimated to have\naccumulated roughly $2.3 trillion in excess savings relative to pre-pandemic levels.1\nAs the Fed tightens monetary policy with the aim of closing the imbalance between\ndemand and supply that has pushed up inflation, the dynamics of these excess savings and the\ndistribution of these savings will be key factors shaping the outlook for output, inflation, and\ninterest rates. Higher savings provide an important buffer to households that can ease the\nadjustment to economic disruptions. However, high savings could also provide a further impetus\nto consumption as the central bank attempts to slow the pace of demand growth. Higher savings\ncould lessen a precautionary pullback in consumption, and it could well take a higher interest\nrate for some time to convince households to hold onto their savings rather than spend them\ndown and add to inflationary pressure.\nHow savings affects the outlook is going to be importantly affected by the distribution of\nthese excess savings across households. Heterogeneity is going to matter. If these savings are\nconcentrated in the upper brackets of the wealth distribution, a group that tends to spend a\n\n1\n\nAditya Aladangady, David Cho, Laura Feiveson and Eugenio Pinto. “Excess Savings during the COVID-19\nPandemic.” FEDS Notes. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Oct. 21, 2022.\n\n2\n\n\fsmaller share of their wealth and income, higher savings might provide little additional\nmomentum to consumption. However, if savings are spread more evenly across the population,\nincluding households with a higher propensity to spend out of wealth, then the effect on the\npersistence of consumption is likely to be larger.\nCurrently, available data suggests that savings remain elevated across the wealth\ndistribution. However, recent evidence also suggests that lower-income households are running\ndown their buffers quickly. This is to say that monitoring the distribution of savings is likely to\nbe important as we think about the course of the economy and the path of policy.\nWhile high savings are likely to provide momentum to consumption and require higher\ninterest rates, the fact that households are wealthier, less financially constrained, and better\ninsured is a positive development. Even so, bringing down inflation will require incentivizing\nsavings over consumption. The short-run pain from monetary contraction is lowest when demand\nmoderation is progressive across the income distribution. Moderating demand growth by\nencouraging high-income households to save more with higher interest rates would certainly be\npreferable to crashing the consumption of lower-income households.\nAcknowledging heterogeneity can also improve our understanding of the forces\ncontributing to elevated inflation. Overall wage growth remains strong, reflecting what by many\nmeasures has been a historically tight labor market. With inflation recently rotating from goods\nto services prices, as supply chain disruptions ease and the labor market remains tight,\nunderstanding wage growth is likely to be important for understanding the overall path of\ninflation.\nNominal wage growth for the median worker is tracking at 6 percent according to the\nAtlanta Fed’s Wage Tracker, but this aggregate number masks an important difference between\njob stayers and job movers. The median worker who switches jobs sees 7.3 percent wage growth,\nwhich is substantially higher than those who stay put at their current job. Furthermore, the rate at\nwhich people switch jobs has increased significantly, especially for prime-age workers, whose\naverage tenure at their current job fell by about three months from 2020 to 2022. With labor\nmarkets historically tight, a calmer labor market with fewer quits and less churn could lower job\nswitching and reduce inflationary pressures by lowering nominal wage growth.\nAdditionally, the first half of 2022 saw a substantial reduction in average labor\nproductivity. If weaker labor markets force people to stay put longer, then they may become\n3\n\n\fmore proficient, and labor productivity growth may provide some inflationary relief in the near\nterm. In addition, many of my District contacts report problems with low worker engagement,\nwhich is a drag on productivity. If workers who no longer see their current job as replaceable\nbecome more engaged, they may also become more productive.\n\nThe Distributional Effects of Monetary Policy\nTurning to the differential effects of monetary policy on heterogeneous groups, we\nshould understand that our policies affect different groups in different ways. Central bankers are\nlargely constrained to using blunt tools, limiting the ability to fine-tune monetary policy. Still,\nthere are potential distributional consequences of central bank policies.\nFor example, in the United States, even after some recent declines, house prices in the\nremain 25 percent above their pre-pandemic trend. This is partly, though certainly not wholly,\ndue to the magnitude and duration of quantitative easing implemented by the Fed from 2020\nthrough 2022, especially the purchase of $1.4 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. Though the\ngoal of these purchases was not to explicitly support house prices, it likely had such an effect.\nHow are the benefits of supporting house prices distributed? People who already own houses,\nwho tend to be wealthier and older, certainly gain. However, their gain may be at the expense of\nothers who cannot get their foot in the door when prices are extremely high, even if rates are also\nlow. Loan-to-income and loan-to-value limits on mortgages are more likely to bind for people\nwithout large down payments, such as young people at the beginning of their careers, and others\nwith relatively low incomes.\nTo close, heterogeneity matters for monetary policy, both in how we interpret the data\nand think about the outlook, as well as in the effect that our policy actions have on the economy.\nAcknowledging that policy can affect diverse groups differently is an important piece of building\nand maintaining central bank credibility. While it is tempting to simplify our analysis through\naggregate measures, we should always be aware of the importance of individuals in setting the\ncourse for the economy and in bearing the consequences of policy decisions.\n\n4\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nNovember 10, 2022\nDelivered at “Energy and the Economy: The New Energy Landscape,” a conference hosted by the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas\nHouston, Texas\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for attending the seventh annual Energy Conference, hosted by the Kansas\nCity and Dallas Federal Reserve Banks.\nEnergy is often in the spotlight given its central role in the economy, but the events of\nthis past year have only further reinforced the importance of energy to our region, the economy,\nand the backdrop for conducting monetary policy. Today I will offer an outlook for the U.S.\neconomy and my views on monetary policy. I’ll set the stage for those perspectives by looking\nfirst at the impact of developments in energy markets.\nEnergy Prices on the Rise\nEnergy prices have been on a wild ride this year. Brent crude oil ran up above $120 a\nbarrel mid-year before falling back to $95 a barrel. Even at the lower level, it is more than 10\npercent higher than the price a year ago and far above the roughly $60 a barrel average price that\nheld over the five years prior to the pandemic. The moves in natural gas prices have been even\nmore dramatic, with domestic natural gas prices doubling through the middle of this year, before\nretreating to a level below where they were last October (and even briefly falling below zero at\none trading hub in recent weeks). However, like oil, natural gas prices remain far above prepandemic averages.\nSimilar to higher prices in the broader economy, the increase in energy prices primarily\nreflects a fundamental imbalance between supply and demand. Resurgent demand following the\nfading of pandemic lockdowns has run into a constrained supply side. Somewhat surprisingly,\nthe oil and gas extraction and petroleum products industries have shown the least recovery of any\nsector in the U.S. economy, both producing at about 60 percent of pre-pandemic levels. This is\neven worse than the supply-chain addled motor vehicle dealer sector, where output is running at\nabout 70 percent of pre-pandemic levels. The imbalance between supply and demand in the oil\nand gas sectors has unsurprisingly pushed up prices.\nOf course, the increase in prices is not solely due to lagging production in the United\nStates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upended the entire global system of energy trade, not\njust for oil, but for almost every form of energy. Russia accounts for more than 10 percent of\nglobal oil exports, close to 20 percent of global natural gas exports, and about 15 percent of\nglobal coal exports—with Europe being its primary market. This heavy reliance pushed\nEuropean natural gas prices to historic highs, and the economic consequences of the energy\n1\n\n\fsupply shock are likely be sizeable for European economies. In addition to the disruption of\ntrade, sanctions are likely to dent global production. The International Energy Agency estimates\na potential loss of 2 percent of world oil supply as sanctions hit Russian production.\nHowever, it is important to note that energy prices were on an upward trend before\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine. For example, the anemic response of the U.S. oil and gas sector to\nhigher prices reflects years of relatively low investment due partly to a shift in investment\ntowards other sources of energy, as well as increased capital discipline following the industry’s\npoor returns during previous boom-bust cycles.\nEnergy Prices and Outlook\nHow will developments in energy markets affect the outlook for growth and inflation?\nRetail gasoline prices reached all-time highs earlier this year, and although prices at the pump\nhave come down, gas prices continue to boost year-over-year inflation. In addition, the price of\ngasoline is perhaps the most salient price in the economy, and fluctuations in gas prices can play\nan outsized role in shaping consumers’ inflation expectations. Currently, longer-term inflation\nexpectations appear to be anchored, but if expectations were to shift, inflation could become\nmore persistent and difficult to control. Highlighting this risk, research by my staff shows that an\nincrease in salient prices, such as gasoline, can have an amplified effect on near-term inflation\nexpectations in an already high-inflation environment.1 Energy prices can also affect inflation as\nan input cost to other industries, like airfares and transportation costs.\nWhat about the implications of higher energy prices for U.S. growth? Higher oil prices\nforce households to spend a larger share of their income on gasoline, lowering their spending on\nother goods and services. Although it is a drag for everyone, it is a larger headwind for lowerincome households that spend a higher share of income on energy. Overall, the negative effect of\nhigher energy prices on consumption can be partly offset by a positive effect on capital\ninvestment in the energy sector. For example, U.S. oil investment boosted total business\ninvestment growth by about 1 percentage point from 2010 to 2014, when growth-oriented oil\ncompanies kept increasing their capacity as oil prices surged. In this cycle, the response of\n\nNida Cakir Melek, Francis M. Dillion, and A. Lee Smith. “Can Higher Gasoline Prices Set Off an Inflationary\nSpiral?” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Economic Review. Forthcoming.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fenergy investment to higher prices has been lackluster, offering less of an offset to the negative\nconsumption effects.\nThe more severe impact of the energy shock on Europe, particularly the disruption of\nnatural gas shipments, will likely also have spillover effects for the U.S. economy. Natural gas is\nan important energy source in Europe, and the effects of a shortage could be particularly notable\nfor Germany’s gas-intensive chemicals, paper, and metals production sectors. Complex global\nsupply chains can propagate and amplify such disruptions, a lesson learned during the pandemic.\nThe Outlook for Inflation and the Economy\nThis energy shock hits during a time of already heightened economic uncertainty.\nAlthough growth has slowed notably this year, the labor market remains tight, and inflation has\nbeen high and persistent. Prices, as measured by the CPI, increased 7.7 percent over the 12\nmonths ending in October, down from, but still uncomfortably close to, the 9 percent 40-year\nhigh recorded in June. While lower energy prices have pulled down overall inflation in recent\nmonths, inflation (excluding energy prices) ran at 6.3 percent in October and has been stuck\nstubbornly at about that level throughout 2022.\nA notable development in recent months has been the rotation of price pressures from\ngoods to services. Goods inflation led the increase in inflation in 2021 and through the beginning\nof this year, as consumers stuck at home upgraded their living spaces and pushed demand for\ndurable goods up against an impaired supply side, snarled by production disruptions and\nlogistical jams. More recently, the combination of easing in supply chain disruptions, slowing\nglobal growth, and higher interest rates have contributed to a deceleration in core goods prices.\nIn contrast, services prices have firmed, with monthly increases that continue to be\namong the largest in decades. In addition, the rise in services prices has been broad-based.\nWhereas goods demand has slowed, and the Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Index has signaled\ncontraction for the first time since 2020, services activity in the District continues to expand,\ncontributing to a tight labor market\nOne compounding factor in the tightness of labor markets and the rise in prices has been\nthe recent poor performance of labor productivity. Output per hour declined at the fastest pace on\nrecord in the first half of the year. While many factors could be behind this decline, including\nchanges in the composition of employment, at this point it is uncertain how persistent this\n3\n\n\fdisappointing productivity growth will be. We asked our District survey contacts about what\nfactors might be behind the declines in labor productivity. The results point to labor mismatch as\nan important factor, with about a third of our contacts reporting a less-qualified workforce\ncompared to pre-pandemic. In addition, the majority of firms reported increased spending and\nresources devoted to employee training.\nThere have been some early indicators that the labor market might be cooling, with\nreported vacancies trending down even as month-to-month changes remain volatile. The rate at\nwhich workers are quitting jobs is also declining, suggesting that workers are becoming a bit less\nconfident that if they leave a job, they’ll easily find a new one. Wage pressures will eventually\nrespond to a cooling labor market, but with a lag. Analysis from my staff suggests that wage\ngrowth crests and starts to fall about a year after the Kansas City Labor Market Conditions\nIndicators (LMCI) activity indicator peaks. Even with the indicator turning down in October, we\nmay still have some time before we see a sustained cooling of wage growth.\nProlonged high inflation could eventually lead to a shift in inflation expectations, a\ndevelopment that would make inflation more persistent and even harder to address, a lesson\nlearned at some cost during the Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s. However, most indicators\nsuggest that even as near-term inflation expectations have risen sharply, expectations are for\ninflation to return to near the Fed’s 2 percent objective in the medium term. Notably, while every\nparticipant in the most recent Survey of Professional Forecasters marked up their expectations\nfor 2022 inflation (and some substantially so), their forecasts of longer-term inflation\nexpectations have scarcely budged.\nWith inflation still elevated and likely to be persistent, monetary policy clearly has more\nwork to do. Earlier hopes that improving supply chains and easing production disruptions would\nsignificantly reduce inflation are fading. As price pressures have rotated from goods to services,\nthe impetus for inflation has moved from tight product markets to tight labor markets. The lower\nresponsiveness of services consumption (and prices) to interest rate increases highlights the\nchallenging dynamics the Federal Reserve faces as it acts to restore price stability.\nOutlook for Monetary Policy\nOver the past year, the Federal Reserve has aggressively tightened monetary policy. The\npolicy rate has increased 375 basis points, the fastest pace since the Fed began to explicitly target\n4\n\n\finterest rates. After more than doubling the size of its balance sheet during the pandemic, the Fed\nis now allowing up to $95 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature every\nmonth, shrinking its asset holdings and putting further upward pressure on interest rates. More\nbroadly, tighter monetary policy has fed through to tighter financial conditions. And tighter\nfinancial conditions are showing through to the real economy as demand eases, especially in\ninterest rate sensitive sectors, such as housing and durable goods.\nStill, imbalances in the economy and the labor market persist, and inflation pressures\nhave yet to let up, suggesting monetary policy and financial conditions must continue to tighten.\nWith the direction of policy clear, the key questions are how far and how quickly will interest\nrates have to rise?\nWhile it is tempting to speculate on how high rates might need to go, the degree of\ntightening necessary will only be determined by observing the dynamics of the economy and\ninflation and cannot be predetermined by theory or pre-pandemic benchmarks. For example, the\nsensitivity of the economy to interest rates can shift for any number of reasons, and judging\nsufficiently restrictive policy could well mean seeing the economy and inflation begin to respond\nin convincing ways. Some have argued that a minimum standard for a restrictive policy is a\npositive inflation-adjusted, or real, rate of interest. Currently, survey evidence indicates that\nconsumers expect inflation to run at about 5 percent over the next year, above the current 3¾ to 4\npercent target range for the policy interest rate, suggesting that the real interest rate remains\nnegative. This measure would point to considerably higher rates than current levels.\nOne factor complicating the determination of how high rates will have to go is the large\nstock of liquid savings on household balance sheets. During the pandemic, fiscal policy\ntransferred a tremendous amount of balance sheet capacity from the government to households\nand business. The government’s borrowing was the private sector’s saving. How households\ntreat this accumulation of saving will be important for shaping the outlook for output, inflation,\nand interest rates. It could very well require a higher interest rate for some time to convince\nhouseholds to hold onto this saving rather than to spend it down and add to the inflationary\nimpulse.\nWith inflation and a tight economy suggesting further increases in interest rates are\nnecessary, at what pace should rates be increased? With a firm commitment to return inflation to\ntarget, the pace of hikes is less important than the strength and communication of this\n5\n\n\fcommitment. I continue to see several advantages for a steady and deliberate approach to raising\nthe policy rate.\nA more measured approached to rate increases may be particularly useful as\npolicymakers judge the economy’s response to higher rates. Already, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s policy actions have led to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. The yield on\nthe 10-year Treasury bond has increased 260 basis points since January, the fastest increase in\nalmost 40 years. Mortgage rates have more than doubled. The dollar has appreciated 10 percent\nagainst a wide range of currencies, and stock market indices have declined by about 20 precent.\nThese are big moves in financial markets, seen previously in only the most extraordinary times.\nThe speed at which rates have increased has likely contributed to the marked increase in\npolicy rate uncertainty, if only by widening the range of possible action. Uncertainty around the\npolicy rate is currently very high, in part reflecting an unsettled outlook, but also importantly,\nuncertainty over the central bank’s reaction function. I expect some of the increase in uncertainty\ncan be attributed to an aggressive front-loading strategy of policy tightening. As the tightening\ncycle continues, now is a particularly important time to avoid unduly contributing to financial\nmarket volatility, especially as volatility stresses market liquidity with the potential to complicate\nbalance sheet run-off plans.\nRestoring price stability is essential to the nation’s long-run economic growth prospects.\nWithout question, monetary policy must respond decisively to high inflation to avoid embedding\nexpectations of future inflation. In my view, a steadfast commitment to returning inflation to the\nCommittee’s target is important. So is the pace of rate increases. Navigating the path ahead in\nthis time of uncertainty and volatility will require attention to both.\n\n6\n\n\f"

            "content": "Constraints on the Economy and Policy\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nSeptember 9, 2022\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nRemarks delivered virtually\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fTwo weeks ago, the Kansas City Fed hosted its annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy\nSymposium. The theme of this year’s program focused on, “Reassessing Constraints on the\nEconomy and Policy.”\nAn elaboration of constraints has been a valuable contribution of the field of economics.\nOpportunity costs, comparative advantage, and the Phillips Curve are all defined around the\nexistence of constraints and limits.\nHowever, over the past quarter-century the economic conversation has been dominated\nby concerns over insufficient demand, and supply constraints faded into the background.\nSupporting this shift, recent recessions—up until the pandemic—have largely been attributed to\nfinancial disruptions related to demand being supported by unsustainable asset allocations. This\nis different from the supply shocks and inflationary dynamics that had driven earlier post-war\nrecessions.\nThe economic recovery following the pandemic shock has brought supply considerations\nback to center stage. Bottlenecks and shortages related to pandemic disruptions have limited\nsupply and driven up prices. More generally, strong demand, supported by a historic level of\nfiscal and monetary accommodation, has pushed on the capacity limits of the economy. With\ndemand no longer insufficient, supply constraints have become a key factor in the outlook for\neconomic activity.\nThe policy response to the pandemic raises additional questions about constraints. The\nextraordinary fiscal and monetary response to the pandemic appeared to redraw the boundaries\nof policy. Innovative and expansive fiscal programs pushed debt-to-GDP ratios to new highs as\ncentral bank balance sheets expanded rapidly with little discussion of constraints.\nAgainst this backdrop, I’ll spend a few minutes on the current outlook for the economy\nand for policy. On the economy, I will argue that the constraints revealed by the pandemic are\nlikely to be with us for some time, perpetuating imbalances, contributing to inflation, and\nrequiring a sustained policy response. I will also argue that constraints continue to bind policy,\nwith a focus on the balance sheet and efforts to significantly reduce it from its current elevated\nlevel.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Economic Outlook\nHigh inflation is certainly a sign that constraints are binding the economy. Prices,\nmeasured on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), increased 6.3 percent in the 12 months\nending in July, down from June’s 40-year high, but still far above the FOMC’s 2 percent\nobjective. Energy prices have played an outsized role in inflation over the past year. Oil prices\nrose with the war in Ukraine but fell back over the summer as recession fears grew. Food prices\nhave also contributed to the rise in inflation. In part, this is related to the run up in agricultural\ncommodity prices connected to the war in Ukraine, but it is also a result of stressed growing\nconditions in many regions around the world, including in the western portion of the Kansas City\nFed’s region.\nHowever, it is not just food and energy prices driving inflation. Excluding food and\nenergy, core PCE prices have risen 4.6 percent over the past 12 months, also near a 40-year high.\nThe rise in inflation has been very broad-based, with almost every category of consumption\nrecording an increase in prices and about one-third of categories showing increases far above\ntrend.\nThe widespread nature of inflation suggests that a tight economy is driving price\npressures rather than solely individual supply disruptions and shocks. Two main factors appear to\nbe contributing to this tightness. First, as the economy reopened throughout 2021, demand\nsurged, underpinned by a tremendous amount of fiscal and monetary policy support. The federal\ngovernment has provided roughly $6 trillion of fiscal stimulus since the start of the pandemic.\nMonetary policy was also very accommodative, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero\nand added over $4 trillion to its balance sheet. While consumption growth has moderated this\nyear, the level of demand remains strong, particularly for goods. For example, the consumption\nof durable goods continues to run about 20 percent above its pre-pandemic trend.\nA second factor boosting inflation has been the inability of the supply side of the\neconomy to keep up with the strength of demand. At first, the lack of supply seemed to largely\nreflect temporary disruptions related to the closing and reopening the economy. However, now it\nseems increasingly apparent that there has been persistent damage to the supply side of the\neconomy as a result of the pandemic.\n\n2\n\n\fConstraints on the Economy\nThree factors coming out of the pandemic seem likely to present a continued drag on\neconomic supply: continuing damage to global supply chains, the quick destruction of capacity\nin the service sector, and long-lasting damage to workforce engagement and labor force\nparticipation. I will quickly review these issues.\nThe shock of the pandemic shutdowns and the sudden shift to goods consumption\ncontinues to reverberate through the global economy, with shortages and logistical snarls still\nplaguing many industries. The war in Ukraine, disruptions to European energy supply, and\ndrought conditions across the globe that have disrupted both agriculture and inland transportation\nas rivers run dry have only contributed further to these supply disruptions. There has been some\ndiscussion that recent shocks could elicit permanent changes in production processes. As the\nefficiency of just-in-time production and global networks gives way to the accumulation of\nunproductive inventories and a preference for resiliency over efficiency, the damage to global\nproductivity could prove permanent.\nA second supply factor contributing to the tightness of the economy, particularly in the\nservice sector, has been the quick destruction of capacity in a number of industries. Services\ninflation has picked up to 4.6 percent, the fastest pace in decades, even as services consumption\nremains 4 percent below its pre-pandemic trend. Elevated inflation suggests the sector is at\ncapacity, although relative to pre-pandemic levels there would still appear to be considerable\nslack. One concrete example of a relatively persistent reduction in capacity appears to be playing\nout in the airline industry. Airfares have climbed 15 percent above pre-pandemic levels as strong\ndemand has run up on a system that has yet to fully recover.\nLabor markets are a third factor shaping the outlook for the supply side of the economy.\nWhile employment growth has been robust, and the unemployment rate has fallen to near record\nlows, workforce engagement continues to lag. The labor force participation rate remains one\npercentage point below pre-pandemic levels, representing roughly 2 million missing workers.\nThe decline in participation is now concentrated among those older than 55 and likely reflects\nearly retirements and health concerns, decisions which can be sticky and difficult to reverse. In\ncontrast, the pandemic-induced decline in participation among prime age women, likely\nreflecting disruptions to dependent care, has now completely reversed, with participation by\nprime age women near an all-time high in July.\n3\n\n\fAn additional factor holding back the ability of supply to ease inflation pressures has\nbeen the abysmal recent performance of productivity. Labor productivity, as measured by output\nper hour, declined almost 6 percent at an annual rate in the first half of the year. It was the largest\ntwo-quarter decline on record.1 The sharp falloff in measured productivity is not surprising when\nwe consider that the economy added 3 million new workers in the first half of the year even as\nthe level of output (as defined by GDP) declined 1 percent at an annual rate. Looking back over\nhistory, GDP has almost never declined for two quarters even as the recorded number of hours\nworked has increased. 2\nMonetary Policy Considerations\nTo repeat a phrase that has become common through the pandemic, we are in\nunprecedented times. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy cannot, of course, reverse the\nsupply shocks or loosen the constraints that have boosted inflation. It can, however, moderate the\npace of demand growth to narrow imbalances in the economy and reduce price pressures. By\nraising interest rates, the Federal Reserve can help manage demand growth, in part by\nincentivizing saving over consumption and also through the effect on asset prices and financial\nmarket conditions.\nBy taking deliberate policy actions, the Federal Reserve can also prevent high inflation\nfrom becoming embedded in price- and wage-setting behavior. For many workers, recent wage\nincreases have not kept pace with price inflation. Declining real, or inflation-adjusted, wages are\nnot sustainable and could lead workers and businesses to build high inflation into wage contracts,\nto the long-term detriment of the labor market. Instead, experience has shown that low and stable\ninflation is most conducive to promoting sustainable growth and to maintaining a strong labor\nmarket that benefits households, workers, and businesses.\nSince March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has increased the policy rate\nby 225 basis points, and, beginning this month, has accelerated the process of shrinking the Fed’s\nbalance sheet. In response to these actions, and with expectations of further rate hikes, broader\nfinancial conditions have tightened, including mortgage and other borrowing rates. However,\nIn a paper presented at this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium (Fernald and Li, 2022), the authors argue that the\nrecent decline in productivity reflects a return to the lackluster pre-pandemic trend.\n2\nOf course, it is possible that the data has been mismeasured, and a number of commentators have noted that\nalternative measures of economic output, such as Gross Domestic Income, paint a more upbeat picture than GDP.\n1\n\n4\n\n\fwith the policy rate still relatively low, the balance sheet still near $9 trillion, and imbalances in\nthe economy still holding up inflation, the case for continuing to remove policy accommodation\nremains clear-cut. The key questions are by how much and how quickly.\nOn the question of how much further tightening is required, I believe only careful\nobservation of the economy will provide the answer. As unsatisfying as it might be, weighing in\non the peak policy rate is likely just speculation at this point. The often-discussed neutral rate of\ninterest, or the tipping point between accommodative and restrictive policy, is an unobserved and\npotentially unstable benchmark, potentially undermining its value as either a guide for policy or\npublic communication. Whether any level of the interest rate is accommodative or restrictive will\ndepend on the interest sensitivity of the economy, which could vary for any number of reasons.\nFor example, as spending shifted away from services toward relatively interest-sensitive housing\nand durable goods during the pandemic, the economy may have become more susceptible to\nhigher interest rates. However, the significant accumulation of liquid savings during the\npandemic could work in the opposite direction, dampening the effects of higher interest rates on\nspending and ultimately inflation.\nWe will have to determine the course of our policy through observation rather than\nreference to theoretical models or pre-pandemic trends. Given the likely lags in the passthrough\nof tighter monetary policy to real economic conditions, this argues for steadiness and\npurposefulness over speed.\nThe path of policy is also likely to influence plans to shrink the Federal Reserve’s\nelevated balance sheet. The economy is in unfamiliar territory, with a combination of high\ninflation and tight labor markets not seen in decades. Markets are understandably volatile as they\ngrapple with the many unknowns surrounding the outlook for the economy. Limiting the extent\nto which uncertainty about the pace of interest rate adjustments contributes to this volatility\ncould be important as balance sheet runoff hits its stride. Certainly, relative to the last time\nbalance sheet reduction was initiated in 2017, market conditions are considerably more unsettled.\nTo the extent that the strains in the Treasury market can be attributed in part to heightened\nuncertainty about the path of policy rates, a steady path of rate increases and predictably\nadjusting this path to incoming data could improve market functioning and facilitate balance\nsheet runoff.\n\n5\n\n\fSuccessfully shrinking the balance sheet will lessen the Federal Reserve’s footprint in\nfinancial markets. In particular, the large balance sheet is distorting the price of duration and\nartificially flattening the yield curve in a way that could promote a reach for yield by investors\nwith potential implications for financial stability.\nDespite plans announced last May to significantly reduce the size of the balance sheet,\nthe potential exists that there is an asymmetry that allows for relatively easy increases in the\nbalance sheet but makes subsequent decreases more difficult. In a paper presented at this year’s\nJackson Hole Symposium, the authors argue that financial markets can become dependent on the\nincreased liquidity added to the system as the balance sheet expands. 3 After markets have\nadapted and allocated the massive increase in liquidity from asset purchases, subsequently\nreducing the balance sheet can be difficult. As a result, large reductions in liquidity, especially\nabsent a signal on longer-run objectives for the balance sheet, can result in volatility, like we\nwitnessed in September 2019. One implication is that a clear signal to financial markets that an\nexpanded balance sheet is temporary and not meant to be permanent could dampen volatility and\nease the drawdown in liquidity in the longer run.\nThis is an important argument as the Federal Reserve considers the ultimate size of its\nbalance sheet. Having committed to operating in an ample reserves regime, what constitutes\n“ample” can evolve over time and will be dependent on the decisions of financial market\nparticipants. A persistently large balance sheet can lead banks to adjust their business models\naround a high level of central bank liquidity, which then raises the amount of reserves required to\nmaintain the ample regime.\nAvoiding this threat will require clear signaling of resolve to shrink the balance sheet and\nremove liquidity. Given a clear signal, markets are less likely to become “liquidity dependent”\nand adjust their behavior in anticipation of declining reserve balances. There may be benefits to\nannouncing the desired reserve levels as the balance sheet shrinks, giving banks time to prepare\nto operate with significantly fewer reserves.\n\nAcharya, Chauhan, Rajan, and Steffen (2022). “Liquidity Dependence: Why Shrinking Central Bank Balance\nSheets is an Uphill Task.”\n3\n\n6\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nAugust 4, 2022\nKansas Bankers Association Annual Conference\nColorado Springs, Colo.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for inviting me to join you for this year’s conference. Doug Wareham and his\nteam are key partners with the Kansas City Fed as we deliver on the Federal Reserve’s core\nmissions for monetary policy, supervision and regulation, and payment services.\nThe role of the banking industry in the U.S. economy has been central to my work at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for more than 40 years. From my first assignment as an\nexaminer in 1982 to my current position as the Bank’s president and CEO and member of the\nFederal Open Market Committee, I have witnessed dramatic changes to the financial system and\nthe broader economic landscape. And despite this tremendous change, it remains as true today as\nit did in 1982 that access to credit and other reliable financial services is essential to the success\nof local communities, households and small businesses.\nWith that overarching theme, my remarks today will focus on some key developments\nthat I view as shaping the current and future community bank landscape. For example, my own\nFederal Reserve district, which covers the heart of the Midwest, parts of the Rocky Mountains,\nand the Southwest, has over the last few decades, gradually urbanized as people moved from\nsmall towns to larger, more urban centers, a trend that parallels much of the rest of the country.1\nThis population shift occurred as the District’s economy became less concentrated in energy and\nagriculture, and moved towards service sectors and away from manufacturing. 2\nIn the face of these changes, community banks have remained a vital source of banking\nservices for consumers and small businesses, including being a key provider of reliable capital.\n\nRappaport, Jordan, “The Faster Growth of Larger, Less Crowded Locations”, Economic Review, Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, 2018, Fourth Quarter.\n2 See for example, Wilkerson, Chad R. and Megan D. Williams, “The Tenth District’s Defining Industries: How Are\nThey Changing”, Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Third Quarter 2007, 59-81.; Wilkerson,\nChad and Megan Williams, “The Transformation of Manufacturing Across Federal Reserve Districts: Success for the\nGreat Plains?”, Economic Review, Second Quarter, 2012, 111-139.; Felix, Alison, “The Growing Importance of the\nServices Sector”, Rocky Mountain Economist, March 29, 2019.\n1\n\n1\n\n\fWhen I talk to business leaders from the region, I often hear stories of how community banks\nhelp support local entrepreneurs and small business owners. 3 I also hear stories of the challenges\ncommunities face when locally based banks disappear. One business owner in our region noted\nthat after her community’s locally owned banks were acquired, she turned to lines of credit from\none of the nation’s largest banks with favorable terms. In the midst of a product expansion,\nhowever, the national economy turned down and the line of credit was quickly withdrawn. The\nexperience stood in sharp contrast to the reliable access to credit and long-term relationships with\na community bank that her business had enjoyed across previous business cycles.\n\nA Forty-Year Perspective on Community Banking\nBy far, the most significant change to the community banking landscape over the past\nfour decades has been the declining number of banks and increased concentration in the banking\nsector. In 1985, just three years after I began my career with the Kansas City Fed, there were\nabout 15,000 community banks in the United States. Today, that number is less than 5,000. 4\nSimilarly, the number of banks in my seven-state region has declined by more than 70 percent\nover that same period. 5\nMost of the decline in the number of banks has been due to mergers and acquisitions.6\nAlthough community banks still represent the vast majority of bank charters, they now account\nfor only about 13 percent of bank assets nationally as the nation’s largest banks have\n\nSee Skodack, Debra. “Enduring Relevance: In an Evolving Landscape, Community Banks Remain Vital to\nCustomers and the Economy”, Ten Magazine, Fall 2021.\n4 Jacewitz, Stefan, “The Increasing Brick-and-Mortar Efficiency of Community Banks”, Economic Review, Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, Second quarter, 2022, 19-35.\n5 Source: Call Reports.\n6 Jagtiani, Julapa. \"Understanding the Effects of the Merger Boom on Community Banks.\" Economic Review-Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City 93.2 (2008): 29.\n3\n\n2\n\n\fsignificantly expanded their market share of assets and deposits. 7 With a relatively rural\ngeography, the Kansas City Fed’s region still features hundreds of community banks, holding\nmore than 60 percent of total banking assets and representing 99 percent of banks. 8\nAs the banking system has consolidated, its role in the financial system also has shifted.\nFor example, banks have become a less important source of corporate credit. The share of\nbusiness loans held by banks has declined from nearly 40 percent in 1985 to less than 25 percent\ntoday, as businesses are now more reliant on publicly issued debt and loans from non-banks. The\ndecline in the number of banks may partly explain their reduced role in business lending, but it is\nnot the whole story. Other factors from outside the financial sector have also contributed to these\ndynamics, including the country’s changing demographics, increasing reliance on technology,\nand landmark regulatory changes.9\nDemographic shifts over the last four decades have significantly changed the composition\nof the U.S. population. Since 1980, the number of Americans 65 and older has more than\ndoubled, and the United States has become more racially and ethnically diverse. The Hispanic\npopulation has tripled, and the U.S. population of those of Asian descent has grown five-fold,\nlargely through immigration.\nThese demographic shifts have changed the communities that small banks serve. Nonmetro counties, where large numbers of community banks operate, have seen both slower\npopulation growth and an aging customer base. These counties are also more racially and\n\nHanauer, Matt, Brent Lytle, Chris Summers, and Stephanie Ziadeh, “Community Banks’ Ongoing Role in the U.S.\nEconomy”, Economic Review, Second Quarter, 2021, 37-81.\n8 Source: Call Reports.\n9 Sengupta, Rajdeep, and Jacob Dice. \"Did Local Factors Contribute to the Decline in Bank Branches?\" Economic\nReview-Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 104.3 (2019): 43-3.\n7\n\n3\n\n\fethnically diverse today than they were decades ago, and community banks have had to adapt\nand adopt new strategies for attracting customers and employees.\nIn addition to demographic changes, technological advancements over the last 40 years\nhave been striking. In the financial services sector, these advancements have disaggregated many\ntraditional banking services. Product origination, delivery methods, and customer interactions\nwith financial institutions have all changed dramatically. Banks are also increasingly automating\nprocesses that have historically required human interaction. Although these changes have\nexpedited account management and allowed banks to leverage more advanced modeling to\nmanage risks, they may also have contributed to larger banks’ economies of scale. Perhaps most\nsignificantly, internet and mobile banking has allowed banks to reach customers across the\nglobe, diminishing the necessity of geographic proximity.\nTechnology has also fostered competition from the broader financial services sector with\nnew entrants promising greater speed, convenience, and flexibility in delivering financial\nservices to households and businesses. More recently, lending and payments platforms have\nmoved outside of the banking industry altogether. Household names in the technology sector\nsuch as Amazon, Facebook, Square, and PayPal, along with a wave of fintech startups, continue\nto pursue cutting-edge financial services.\nThese technological innovations reflect customers’ changing preferences for value and\nconvenience. In particular, the demand for fast and mobile payments continues to grow, and\nservices providing these features are being adopted at a very rapid pace.\nAlong with payment innovations, non-bank lenders, especially fintechs, have made\nsignificant inroads into loan markets. Business lending by fintechs has grown very rapidly in\nrecent years. This shift could reflect changes in customers’ expectations or a considered decision\n\n4\n\n\fby banks to avoid certain risky assets. Nonetheless, the trend does suggest a move toward\ntransactional lending forms and away from relationship-based lending. If these trends accelerate,\nlenders that rely heavily on technological solutions using “big-data” to reach borrowers could\nchallenge community banks’ “soft information” advantage and market share.\nFinally, regulation has been an important factor shaping the evolution of banking. Across\nthe spectrum of regulatory changes, three aspects of regulation have factored prominently:\ngeographic deregulation, the deregulation of non-banking activities, and regulation in response to\ncrises.\nGeographic deregulation began slowly in the late 1970s before picking up rapidly in the\n1980s. Ultimately, what started as localized efforts to remove barriers to entry for banks resulted\nin federal legislation that allowed banks to operate and branch nationwide. 10 As a result, bank\nconsolidation picked up considerably starting in the 1980s, mostly reflected in mergers of\nsmaller banks as intra- and interstate restrictions were relaxed. However, geographic\nderegulation also enabled the largest banks to begin operating nationwide and to compete\nglobally. As market share of the largest banks increased in key loan markets, many community\nbanks looked to mergers for scale or saw their balance sheets become more concentrated as some\nbusiness lines moved to larger competitors. 11\nThrough the 1990s, as banking consolidated, the largest banks also began to engage in\nwhat were traditionally considered non-banking activities, predominately securities dealing and\nunderwriting. While these activities had been prohibited at banks for close to 70 years under the\nGlass-Steagall Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 permitted a wider array of activities at\n\nRice, Tara and Phillip E. Strahan. “Does Credit Competition Affect Small-Firm Finance?”, The Journal of Finance,\n65(3), 2010, 861-889.\n11 Regehr, Kristen, and Rajdeep Sengupta. \"Sectoral Loan Concentration and Bank Performance (2001-2014).\"\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Working Paper 16-13 (2016).\n10\n\n5\n\n\fbank holding companies. In response, bank holding companies began engaging in investment\nbanking while also maintaining access to important safety net advantages, such as deposit\ninsurance and access to Federal Reserve services.\nThe deregulation of banks’ activities and geographic operation produced two very\ndifferent commercial banking models. Today, thousands of small community banks continue to\noperate in traditional business lines. At the same time, a handful of large banking organizations\nnow operate at such scale and are so intertwined with the financial system that their failure poses\nsystemic risks to the global economy. As revealed during the Global Financial Crisis, large banks\nhave enjoyed some benefits from being “too big to fail.”\nAfter the financial crisis, however, the regulatory environment changed, as it often has\nfollowing financial and economic crises. Regulators sought to learn from the earlier agricultural\nbank and Savings and Loan crises of the 1980s, as well as the Global Financial Crisis of 20072009, and took steps to ensure a safer banking system after each crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act of\n2010, for example, made important inroads into addressing “too big to fail” advantages—though\nhow successful it was remains to be seen.\nThe regulatory responses to these crises have generally taken a one-size-fits-all approach.\nRegulations can be blunt instruments, failing to effectively account for the incentives and risk\nprofiles associated with the relationship lending model of many smaller banks. As a result,\ncommunity banks can bear a disproportionate burden as they implement costly compliance\nprocesses without commensurate benefits to safety and soundness or fair access to credit.\n\n6\n\n\fThe Importance of Community Banks\nEven as new nonbank entrants become embedded in the financial services sector, the\nbanking system continues to hold a unique role in our economy. Banks remain the primary\nfinancial firms for providing liquidity when needed, ensuring payments are readily transferable,\nand facilitating monetary policy implementation.\nFor their part, community banks continue to leverage relationship lending, with a focus\non local lending and deposit-taking. Credit decisions are based on qualitative as well as\nquantitative aspects of a borrower’s credit profile. In particular, smaller banks provide a critical\nsource of financing for small businesses. Despite holding a fraction of the nation’s banking\nassets, community banks underwrite a sizeable 40 percent of lending to small businesses. The\nstrength of the relationship between community banks and small businesses was highlighted\nduring the implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program. At a time when COVID-19\nlockdowns threatened the viability of many small businesses, community banks ensured that\npandemic relief funds quickly reached this segment of our economy, ultimately holding 37\npercent of all outstanding PPP loans serviced by banks. 12\nBeyond lending to local businesses and households, smaller banks often serve key\nleadership roles in their communities. These bankers sit on the boards of local schools, hospitals,\nand other civic organizations, not only meeting the credit needs of their local communities, but\nthey are also an integral part of them.\nGiven the importance of these attributes to local economies, the implications of an\nevolving financial services landscape for access to credit in rural markets, for small business, and\nfor the overall health of Main Street should be carefully considered. Both regulators and banks\nMarsh, W. Blake and Padma Sharma, “PPP Raised Community Bank Revenue but Lowered Profitability”,\nEconomic Bulletin, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, December 2020.\n12\n\n7\n\n\fwill be influential in ensuring these critical financial services can continue to meet the needs of\nthousands of communities, safely and efficiently.\n\nA Message to Regulators\nHaving been handed thousands and thousands of pages of legislation intended to secure\nthe financial stability of our nation’s financial system, it’s a tall order to ask bank regulators to\nminimize regulatory and supervisory burden while promoting competition and maintaining the\nsafety and soundness of the banking system. It is made more difficult when the business models\nof banks vary from small, traditional banks to global systemically important banks. Still, in the\ninterest of meeting the range of business needs served by these institutions, I see opportunities\nfor further calibrating the supervisory framework, taking into account the business model of\nsmall banks in three key areas: advancing risk-focused approaches to supervision, appropriately\ntailoring capital requirements, and providing clearer guidance around innovation and alternative\nbusiness models.\nOver the past four decades, the volume and complexity of the data collected from\ncommunity banks has increased substantially. This data has supported both policy development\nand supervision. Unfortunately, the time spent on the examination of an individual community\nbank has not meaningfully declined as a result of this data collection. In fact, according to the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors, the most recent Community Bank Sentiment Index\nshowed that community banker sentiment toward regulatory burden is at a multi-year low and\nmore negative than any other component. 13 Moreover, a large majority—81 percent of\nrespondents—expect regulatory burden will be worse in the future. 14\n13\n14\n\nConference of State Bank Supervisors, “Community Bank Sentiment Index”, second quarter of 2022.\nIbid.\n\n8\n\n\fUnder the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA),\nregulations can be questioned for their continued effectiveness and burden. This provides an\navenue to reshape the supervisory framework in way that preserves its focus on safety and\nsoundness and fair access to credit while recognizing today’s banking landscape requires a far\nmore tailored approach.\nAmong these regulations, capital requirements play a particularly important role in the\nstability of our financial system. Here, too, ensuring that these requirements are capturing the full\nrange of risks and avoiding unintended advantages will be necessary. The financial crisis of\n2007-2008, as well as the market upheavals of March 2020, demonstrated that extreme events\ncan and do happen. Most importantly, bank failures, particularly large bank failures, are costly.\nCapital requirements should reflect these heavy social costs.\nCurrently, the nation’s largest banks hold less capital than community banks. While small\nbanks in the United States hold a Tier 1 leverage ratio of nearly 10 percent, global systemically\nimportant banks hold just under 7 percent.15 Imbalanced capital requirements, combined with\nperceived market advantages, can result in disproportionate gains for large banks and their\nshareholders. As a result, large banks may capture market share, thereby encouraging community\nbanks to consolidate to compete. More work is needed in my view to tailor capital requirements\nacross bank size and business models.\nFinally, as the financial services landscape continues to evolve, regulators play an\nimportant role in providing clear expectations and timely guidance to regulated entities. The\nability of smaller banks to compete and innovate as they respond to market dynamics and\n\nPellerin, Sabrina, “Bank Capital Analysis Semiannual Update,” Bank Capital Analysis, Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City, May 2022.\n15\n\n9\n\n\fcustomer preferences will depend on such guidance, especially to evaluate investments in\ntechnology and various fintech and vendor partnerships.\n\nA Message to Bankers\nA more-tailored approach to regulation does not of course solve for every challenge\nconfronting community banks, as bankers well understand. The strategies these banks pursue\nhave long been the key determinant of their success and survival in meeting their communities’\nneeds. Those strategies increasingly hinge on adopting new technology to meet the demands of a\nmobile and connected customer base and to attract talent. By doing so, bankers can lower costs,\nreach new customer segments—including underbanked populations—and drive new business\ngrowth.\nInvestments in technology can help banks meet their customers’ changing needs, gain\noperational efficiencies, improve access to an evolving payments system, and better connect\nlocal customers to the broader economy. Adoption of instant payments settlement services, for\nexample, offers the ability to provide new services that meet customer preferences for speed.\nAlongside private sector services, the Federal Reserve’s implementation next year of a new retail\npayment rail known as FedNow will allow banks of all sizes to meet household and business\ndemand for real-time payments.\nDeploying contemporary technology also can help to attract and retain a workforce with\ndiverse skillsets. This talent can, in turn, help banks identify what is needed to compete in a\nconnected, fast-paced world, and importantly, provide critical leadership succession.\n\n10\n\n\fConclusion\nThe economic vitality of thousands of communities and rural geographies depends on\nreliable access to credit and other financial services. Over the past 40 years, much has changed in\nthe delivery of those services, driven by demographics, technological innovation, and regulation.\nOver this time, community banks have continued to play an instrumental role in meeting the\nneeds of rural places and their communities. With the right mix of strategy and innovation, and a\nwell-calibrated regulatory approach, the community bank model can continue to be a trusted\ncornerstone of the U.S. financial system for thousands of households and small businesses who\nlook to them for essential credit needs and services.\n\n11\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMay 23, 2022\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Agricultural Symposium\nKansas City, Mo.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fGood evening. We’re pleased to host this year’s symposium to talk about a sector of the\neconomy that is particularly important to the region we serve. I very much appreciate your\nparticipation and look forward to our discussion.\nThis year’s topic takes a close look at labor market dynamics in the agricultural sector.\nAs the title “Help Wanted in Agriculture” suggests, the availability of workers is a central\nconcern among producers. This is true not only in agriculture but across the wider economy. In\nmy remarks this evening, I’ll talk about these labor market challenges in the context of broader\neconomic conditions and will offer an outlook for the economy and for monetary policy.\nI should acknowledge at the outset that a centerpiece of any observations about the\neconomy is high inflation. After decades of low and stable prices in the United States, inflation\nhas emerged as a central challenge in the economy. Prices are moving up, and more rapidly than\nat any point in the recent past. Over the year ending in April, the consumer price index (CPI)\nrose 8.3 percent, near the fastest pace in 40 years. Steep increases in energy and food prices are\nreflected in this number, partly attributable to disrupted commodity markets following Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine. But that is not the full story. Excluding food and energy, prices increased\n6.2 percent over the last year, also near a 40-year high.\nWhen inflation first started to pick up in early 2021, a few standout categories of goods\nseemed to be driving the increase. Prices for cars (new, used, and rented) played a\ndisproportionate role in boosting the overall inflation rate, even as many other categories of\nconsumption showed little price pressure. In fact, inflation at that time was historically dispersed.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, categories of goods and services accounting for about 20 percent of\nspending recorded inflation rates significantly higher than their previous trends. An even greater\nshare, about 25 percent, were showing rates of inflation significantly below trend. However, by\nthe end of 2021, price pressures had broadened significantly, with almost 50 percent of\nexpenditures recording inflation significantly above previous trends, while the proportion of\ngoods and services with exceptionally weak inflation had collapsed to zero.\nThe inflation we are now experiencing is obviously both too high and too broad to\ndismiss. It has become a top priority for the Federal Reserve to return inflation to its 2 percent\nobjective.\n\n1\n\n\fHow did we get here?\nThe factors behind the recent increase in prices are fairly straightforward: When demand\nfor goods and services exceeds the economy’s ability to supply those goods and services, prices\nrise. The nature of this demand and supply imbalance, however, poses some challenging issues\nfor policymakers.\nAs the economy reopened throughout 2021, demand surged, supported by a tremendous\namount of policy stimulus. The federal government has provided about $6 trillion of fiscal\nstimulus since the start of the pandemic. Monetary policy was also very accommodative, as the\nFederal Reserve cut interest rates to zero and added over $4 trillion to its balance sheet.\nTogether, fiscal and monetary policy provided a massive boost to the economy, encouraging\nconsumers to spend.\nAnd spend they did, particularly on goods. Additional time at home during the pandemic\napparently allowed households to identify needs they might not have previously known they had,\nand demand for kitchen appliances, entertainment systems, and exercise equipment skyrocketed.\nAlthough purchases of durable goods have eased after jumping in the first half of last year, they\nremain about 10 percent above pre-pandemic trends.\nThe fast recovery of the labor market has also encouraged spending. The economy added\na record number of jobs in 2021. In the first four months of this year, a further 2 million jobs\nwere added, about equal to the total number of jobs created in each full year of the 2010s. More\npeople working increases incomes and supports higher spending.\nWith the amount of stimulus injected into the economy, the strength of demand is not\nparticularly surprising. Although the surge in consumption was certainly not a given recalling\nhow uncertain the course of the pandemic remained throughout 2021. What is more surprising,\nfrom my perspective, is the underperformance of the supply side of the economy. Even as\ninflation suggests that the economy is operating far above capacity, practically bursting at the\nseams, the level of real GDP remains 2½ percent below its pre-pandemic trend, a shortfall equal\nto a typical year’s worth of growth.\nThe emergence of supply constraints has put the economy in somewhat unfamiliar\nterritory. In the two decades prior to the pandemic, it was widely thought that the primary factor\nholding back economic growth was weak demand. Underlying this belief was the relative benign\nnature of inflation over this period, even in the face of historically low global interest rates and\n2\n\n\flow unemployment. An apparently low neutral rate of interest, a level known to economists as rstar, suggested that monetary policy had to work pretty hard just to keep demand in the vicinity\nof the economy’s available supply.\nNow supply constraints dominate the economic narrative. What changed? One possibility\nis that nothing has changed. Perhaps the pre-pandemic economy was closer to full capacity than\nwe realized. However, another possibility is that the pandemic has resulted in persistent, perhaps\neven permanent, damage to the productive capacity of the economy. This damage could be\nmanifested along a number of dimensions. I’ll highlight three: persistent damage to global supply\nchains, the quick destruction of capacity in the services sector, and long-lasting damage to\nworkforce engagement and labor force participation.\nPersistent disruptions to supply chains\nThe initial shock of the global shutdown in March 2020 tangled the carefully coordinated\nmovement of shipping containers, the lifeblood of global commerce, and disrupted global\nproduction networks. Although progress has been made and the line of ships waiting off the\nshore of Long Beach has diminished, disruptions have migrated to other parts of the supply\nchain. For example, warehouse space has become scarce in many markets.\nProduction and capacity have also been affected. The semiconductor shortage and its\nimpact on the automobile sector are well known, but other industries have also been hit by\nshutdowns. For example, in 2020, following a sharp fall-off in demand for diesel and gasoline, a\nnumber of refineries in the United States permanently shut down, lowering domestic refining\ncapacity by 5 percent. This loss of capacity has contributed to the run up in fuel prices this year\nas remaining capacity is running flat out.\nMore broadly, the war in Ukraine has disrupted the supply and transportation of many\ncommodities, pushing up prices for energy and food across the world. The international price of\ncrude oil has increased 40 percent since the beginning of the year, as sanctions threaten the flow\nof oil from Russia, the world’s third largest producer and a major exporter. Likewise, the price of\nnatural gas, another key Russian export, has climbed around the world, putting upward pressure\non prices for the whole constellation of goods and services for which natural gas is a key input,\nfrom electricity to fertilizer.\n\n3\n\n\fSimilar to energy markets, the prices of many agricultural commodities also surged with\nthe war in Ukraine and have remained very high. The price of wheat, for example, is about\ndouble what it was a year ago, but the prices of other major commodities are also considerably\nhigher than last year and much higher than before the pandemic. While the increase in prices has\nsupported incomes in the farm sector, I have heard many contacts in our region describe their\nangst about rising input costs, or potentially even the availability of some key inputs, such as\nfertilizer. Alongside strong incomes, the price of farmland in many parts of the country has also\nset new records, which may be positive for those who own land, but has begun to raise costs\nsubstantially for those who rent from one year to the next.\nAcross the spectrum of these supply constraints is growing concern about the persistence\nof these issues. As the efficiency of just-in-time production and global networks gives way to the\naccumulation of unproductive inventories and a preference for resiliency over efficiency, the\ndamage could prove permanent. These effects are compounded by a war that has had a dramatic\nimpact on global commodity markets and offers few signs of near-term resolution.\nThe quick destruction of capacity in the service sector\nA second factor pointing to supply-side damage can be found in the service sector of the\neconomy. Transportation and production bottlenecks have been particularly important for\nexplaining the upward movement in goods prices, but recently services prices have also been\npicking up. The 12-month change in services prices (excluding energy) reached 4.9 percent in\nApril, the fastest pace in over 30 years. In April alone, services prices increased 0.7 percent, also\na 30-year high. This jump is particularly notable because service price inflation is normally\nstable month-to-month. Over the past three decades, for example, 70 percent of the time the\nmonthly changes in services prices have hovered between 0.2 or 0.3 percent.\nThe increase in services price inflation is occurring despite continued weakness in the\nsector. Consumption of services only returned to pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of this\nyear, and, if we were to extend the pre-pandemic trend growth rate, services consumption is 4\npercent below where it might have been. Given apparent slack in the services sector, why are\nprices moving up so strongly? It could be that excess capacity in the services sector disappeared\nmuch more quickly than we might have anticipated, so that even with subpar output the sector is\n\n4\n\n\fnot actually operating with much slack. Lack of labor supply is clearly part of the story (and one\nI’ll discuss later) but this sector saw capacity destruction early on.\nThe pandemic recession was different from most recessions in that demand for services\nwas hit particularly hard while demand for goods skyrocketed. Typically, the consumption of\ngoods falls more steeply than services with downward pressure on prices as slack opens up in the\neconomy. What we may be seeing in the current services-led recession is a much quicker\nadjustment of available capacity than in a typical recession. Lower fixed costs in the services\nindustry may have allowed firms to quickly eliminate excess capacity in reaction to a steep fall in\ndemand.\nTo provide a concrete example, let’s look at the market for haircuts. The real\nconsumption of haircuts has decreased by over one-third relative to pre-pandemic levels, a\ndecline likely initially attributable to social distancing and then later to the relaxed grooming\nstandards associated with working from home.\nGiven a traditional understanding of the economy, with fixed costs to adjusting capacity,\nthis sharp falloff in demand for haircuts should have resulted in a tremendous amount of slack in\nthe hairdressing industry and downward pressure on prices. However, the price of haircuts has\nnot declined, but rather recorded some of the largest increases in decades. Post-pandemic, haircut\ninflation has been running at about a 5 percent pace, the fastest pace in 40 years and about twice\nthe pre-pandemic average.\nWhy would prices rise with this sharp drop in demand? It appears that the industry\nreacted quickly to the fall in demand and cut capacity. Employment in the industry is down 15\npercent from pre-pandemic levels and has shown little movement in recent months. Interestingly,\nthere has been a large increase in the number of establishments, both barber shops and beauty\nsalons, but only locations with less than 5 employees. The number of larger establishments with\nmore than 5 employees has fallen off sharply.\nA similar, more publicized, dynamic has played out in the air travel industry. After\nplunging in the initial months of the pandemic, air travel has bounced back but remains almost\n10 percent below pre-pandemic levels. However, airfares have increased robustly over the past\nyear and are now close to 15 percent higher than their pre-pandemic level. The industry quickly\ncut capacity after air travel plummeted in the spring of 2020 and increasing capacity with the\nrevival of demand has been difficult.\n5\n\n\fContinuing labor market frictions\nThe inability of the service sector to quickly add capacity is intrinsically related to the\nthird factor holding back the supply side of the economy: continued frictions in the labor market.\nBy many metrics, the labor market appears to be unusually tight. The unemployment rate, at 3.6\npercent, is close to a historic low. The number of posted job vacancies is the highest on record,\nas is the pace at which workers are quitting their jobs, an indicator of a hot labor market as\nworkers are more likely to quit when alternative opportunities are abundant. Speaking to contacts\nin the region, hiring and retaining workers is an acute challenge. Yet, notwithstanding the\napparent tightness of the labor market, employment remains over 1 million workers short of prepandemic levels and considerably further below the pre-pandemic trend. What explains this gap?\nI will highlight two dynamics weighing on the labor force: lagging labor force participation and a\nsignificant step down in the pace of immigration.\nIn April, the percentage of the working age population participating in the labor force\nwas 1.2 percentage points lower than before the pandemic. Controlling for population growth\nand aging, this implies a gap of about 2 million workers relative to pre-pandemic levels. 1 Earlier\nin the recovery, prime age women made up a disproportionate number of the missing workers,\npossibly due to disruptions to childcare arrangements. More recently, prime age participation has\nrebounded to close to pre-pandemic levels, such that the largest contributors to the current gap in\nparticipation are workers older than 65. Participation for the 65-plus age group fell off sharply\nwith the pandemic and has not shown much recovery, perhaps as fears of illness lessened the\ndesire to work and this was a feasible option as rising asset values boosted retirement wealth.\nAnother factor contributing to the tight labor market has likely been a significant fall off\nin the number of immigrants. This issue is often highlighted by our regional contacts in the\nagricultural sector and other parts of the economy. Immigration started to move down in 2016\nand then fell off sharply during the pandemic. If immigration had continued at its earlier trend\nfor the previous five years, estimates suggest there would be an additional 3 million immigrants,\nmany of whom would have joined the workforce.2\n\nSee Tuzemen, “How Many Workers are Truly ‘Missing’ from the Labor Force?” Economic Bulletin, May 6, 2022.\nSee Cohen and Shampine, “Immigration Shortfall May be a Headwind for Labor Supply” Economic Bulletin, May\n11, 2022.\n1\n2\n\n6\n\n\fWhere do we go from here?\nWith these thorny supply side issues affecting the economy, what role does monetary\npolicy play? Certainly, monetary policy cannot fix supply shocks. But monetary policy does play\nan important role in addressing the imbalances between supply and demand. With inflation high,\nmonetary policy must act to dampen the pace of demand growth, bringing demand into\nalignment with supply and relieving pressure on prices.\nOn the supply side, for example, faster increases in production, perhaps as supply chains\ncontinue to untangle or as a greater number of workers return to the labor force, could relieve\npressure on prices as monetary policy tightens. Conversely, even further disruptions to\nproduction, from continued lockdowns in China or further fallout from the Ukraine war, could\nadd to inflation pressures and require a stronger monetary policy response.\nOn the demand side, if, as appears increasingly likely, the war proves a major drag on\nglobal growth, or if Covid lockdowns substantially dent growth in China, then lower demand\nmight take some of the heat out of inflation. However, an important wildcard in the outlook for\ndemand is the trillions of dollars of excess savings sitting in household bank accounts. These\nsavings represented a reassuring buffer early on. Now with demand hot and persistent supply\nconstraints, an abundance of liquid checking deposits could potentially make the Federal\nReserve’s job of cooling demand more challenging.\nConsiderations for the path of policy\nWith inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment rate near record lows, the stance\nof monetary policy has belatedly shifted to the removal of accommodation. A series of interest\nrate increases combined with significant reductions in asset holdings are underway. However,\nwith real inflation-adjusted interest rates still deeply negative and the balance sheet twice its prepandemic size, questions about the path of policy are prevalent. I will provide some context on\nhow I am thinking about these questions.\nThe responsiveness of the economy to changes in the interest rate can be difficult to\npredict in part because it is likely to vary over time. For example, with consumption skewed\ntowards durable goods, which tend to be more interest-sensitive than other components of\nspending, it is possible that higher rates will have a more pronounced impact on demand and\n7\n\n\finflation than observed in the past. On the other hand, high levels of liquidity in the economy and\nhealthy household balance sheets might make consumption less reactive to higher interest rates.\nFed policymakers have emphasized a commitment to act expeditiously to restore price\nstability, and I expect that further rate increases could put the federal funds rate in the\nneighborhood of 2 percent by August, a significant pace of change in policy settings. Balance\nsheet reduction plans will also be underway as a tightening mechanism, with financial markets\nfar more unsettled currently than in 2017, when the Fed last initiated a rundown in the size of its\nbalance sheet. Communicating about our policy path to avoid introducing any further uncertainty\ncan ensure progress in significantly reducing the size of the balance sheet and lessening the\ncentral bank’s footprint in financial markets. Evidence that inflation is clearly decelerating will\ninform judgments about further tightening.\nThe central bank’s job is to prevent persistent imbalances from feeding into inflation and\nunmooring inflation expectations. By influencing interest rates, the Federal Reserve primarily\naffects the demand side of the imbalance. The evolution of its efforts alongside other factors will\naffect the course of monetary policy, requiring continuous and careful monitoring.\n\n8\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMarch 30, 2022\nThe Economic Club of New York\nRemarks delivered virtually\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fMy thanks to the Economic Club of New York for the invitation to speak. I look forward\nto today’s conversation.\nThe economy is emerging from the shadow of the pandemic. Public health restrictions are\nbeing lifted, workers are commuting again, and things are beginning to return to normal, even if\nthere is a good chance that “normal” isn’t quite the same normal that we left behind. Over the\npast two years, there was an unprecedented use of the word “unprecedented” to describe the\neconomy. And understandably so. We had a record decline in jobs, then a record rebound. A\nhistoric drop in output followed by a historic gain. All supported by a previously unimagined\nlevel of fiscal and monetary policy support. That it was an “unprecedented” time in the nation’s\neconomy is no exaggeration.\nNow as many of us return to our offices after a two-year hiatus and dust off our desks, the\neconomy faces yet another challenge: high inflation. Instead of calling it unprecedented,\nhowever, I often hear people suggest that the current economy has an uncomfortable\nresemblance to that of the 1970s with inflation now running at a pace not seen since that era.\nWithout elaborating on what I view as important differences between now and the 1970s, the\nfocus on high inflation is undebatable.\nFor policymakers, understanding the nature of today’s inflation dynamics is essential.\nHow will the extraordinary shock of the pandemic play out relative to the dynamics that have\nshaped economies over time, and what lessons can be drawn from past inflationary periods?\nBoth aspects are relevant in my view to how the economy is likely to evolve, particularly as it\nrelates to inflation.\nIn my remarks this afternoon, I will offer my views on the factors I see shaping the\noutlook for economic activity and inflation, and how those factors inform my thinking about the\nappropriate path for monetary policy.\n\nThe Outlook for Demand, Supply, and Inflation\nConsumers continue to spend, and the underlying fundamentals for consumption are\npositive. Retail sales adjusted for inflation increased 9 percent over the 12 months ending in\nFebruary, far above the average 2½ percent pace observed in the decade prior to the pandemic.\nThis burst of consumption has been particularly apparent for long-lasting durable goods as the\n1\n\n\fpandemic scrambled typical spending patterns away from services, such as gyms, restaurants,\nand movie theaters, and towards goods, such as treadmills, kitchen appliances, and home\nentertainment systems. Although there is good reason to think spending patterns will eventually\nreturn to pre-pandemic trends, the demand for goods has shown only modest signs of abating so\nfar, and spending on many services remains depressed.\nOverall consumption has been supported by strong income growth. Since the beginning\nof 2020, personal income has increased at a faster rate than in any two-year period in the past 15\nyears, first as the result of stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits and then with\nthe rapid recovery in the labor market with employment increasing and wages rising. Households\nnow hold over $2 trillion in additional savings relative to pre-pandemic trends, positioning them\nwith the capacity to spend.\nThis robust demand has outpaced the available supply of goods and services, especially\nas pandemic-related disruptions continue to weigh on product and labor markets, and\ngeopolitical conflict has further impeded the supply of many commodities.\nProduction bottlenecks and shortages originated in the rapid closing and subsequent slow\nreopening of the economy during the pandemic. The range of disruptions across factories and\nacross countries has jumbled global supply chains, as have disruptions to transportation\nnetworks. Signs of improvement are slowly emerging. The New York Fed’s index of global\nsupply chain pressures fell notably in January and February, and inventories rose faster at the end\nof 2021 than any time since 2015, suggesting that companies are finding ways to work around\nthese constraints.\nA lack of labor also has been an important supply constraint. Contacts in my region\ncontinue to express concern about labor shortages. These reports align with the data, reflecting\nthe ratio of job openings per unemployed person near all-time highs and workers quitting jobs at\na record pace. The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.8 percent in\nFebruary while wage gains have been picking up in recent months.\nStill, many workers remain on the sidelines. In February, the labor force participation rate\nremained 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic level. Taking into account the trend decline\nin participation as the population ages, this amounts to a shortage of roughly 2 million workers.\nUnderstanding what is keeping these workers out of the labor market, and how persistent these\n\n2\n\n\ffactors are, will be important for determining how quickly the economy will grow, as well as the\nsplit between output growth and higher inflation.\nWhy have workers left the labor market? The pandemic likely remains a key\nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly. In February, 1.2 million people reported\nnot being in the labor force because of Covid. Throughout the pandemic, issues in childcare\navailability have stood out as a key constraint on labor force participation. And here things are\nnot yet back to normal. Employment in daycare facilities, a proxy for capacity, has only slowly\nrecovered and remains 11 percent below pre-pandemic levels. However, it is not only childcare.\nEmployment in nursing and residential care facilities has declined some 12 percent since the\nbeginning of 2020, and it has shown almost no recovery to date. This substantial shift in family\ncare responsibilities towards households may take some time to resolve.\nAnother contributor to lower labor force participation has been a large increase in the\nproportion of the population that reports being retired. While these workers are generally not\nattributing their lack of workforce participation to Covid, I would not underplay the role that the\npandemic could have in elevating the retirement rate. Looking at detailed data, it appears much\nof the increase in the reported retired population does not reflect workers moving from\nemployment to retirement but rather a sharp slowdown in the number of retirees returning to\nwork. 1 In normal times, there is a regular flow of retired individuals who move back into\nemployment, in some cases out of personal interest or in other cases out of necessity. During the\npandemic it appears as though more retirees decided to stay retired, perhaps related to pandemic\nconcerns or as buoyant equity and housing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs and\nfinancial security. A change associated with either reason could bring some fraction of these\nworkers back over time.\nThese supply constraints in the face of strong demand are pushing up inflation to a 40year high. CPI inflation was nearly 8 percent in February, with core inflation, stripping out food\nand energy prices, at 6.4 percent. Initially, the run-up in inflation was primarily associated with a\nfew specific goods, particularly cars (new, used, and rented). This led to assumptions that such\nprice pressures would dissipate. But rather than being short-lived, inflation has broadened its\nreach. Currently, inflation for almost half of a typical consumer’s purchase bundle is far above a\nfive-year average. Consumer sentiment has plummeted as a result.\n1\n\nWhat Has Driven the Recent Increase in Retirements? - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (kansascityfed.org)\n\n3\n\n\fThe outlook for inflation will be affected in several ways. Supply constraints can be\nexpected to ease as workers re-enter the labor force and transportation and production networks\nuntangle, taking some pressure off inflation. The timeline for seeing this relief is highly\nuncertain. Demand growth is also expected to cool, as fiscal policy becomes less expansionary\nand monetary policy accommodation is removed to stabilize prices. That process is just getting\nunderway.\nAt present, global dynamics pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. Although the\npandemic has fortunately taken a backseat in the U.S., effects continue to be felt in other parts of\nthe world with the capacity to disrupt. The U.K. and Europe are witnessing rising case counts as\nan even newer variant takes hold. A particularly saliant risk is the continued threat of lockdowns\nin China as that country’s zero-Covid strategy runs up against ever more transmissible variants.\nShutdowns, of course, will aggravate already disrupted global supply chains, likely boosting\nprices, even as the lockdowns could weigh on China’s demand and global growth.\nAdditionally, the conflict in Ukraine presents a variety of risks to the outlook, both on the\nsupply and the demand side. Prices have moved up sharply for a number of commodities, both as\nUkrainian production has been affected and as sanctions limit Russian exports. Given Russia’s\nimportance in global energy production, we have seen a sharp rise in oil and natural gas prices.\nThe conflict has further boosted inflation, and it threatens to extend or worsen supply chain\ndisruptions.\nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy\nAgainst this backdrop of high inflation, last week, the FOMC began adjusting the stance\nof policy. The Committee raised the policy rate by 25 basis points and signaled that it will soon\nbegin the process of running down the Fed’s balance sheet.\nGiven the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment\nrate near record lows, it is clear that removing accommodation is required. How much and how\naggressively accommodation should be removed is far more uncertain.\nReal interest rates—that is, the interest rate adjusted for the pace of inflation—remain\nhighly negative, encouraging borrowing and consumption. In addition, the balance sheet now\nstands at a record $9 trillion. By holding a substantial share of U.S. Treasury debt as well as\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS), these asset holdings are putting significant downward\n4\n\n\fpressure on longer-run interest rates, by some estimates lowering the yield on the 10-year\nTreasury by 150 basis points. 2 All in all, monetary policy is likely as accommodative as it has\never been at a time when inflation is well above the Fed’s target and labor markets are tight.\n\nConsiderations in the Removal of Accommodation\nWith the current stance of monetary policy out of sync with the state of the economy,\npolicymakers face a challenging set of global and domestic dynamics as they begin the process\nof removing accommodation. My own thinking about the approach to removing accommodation\nis influenced by several considerations.\nThe first takes into account continued risks to the outlook associated with further\npandemic-related disruptions in Europe and Asia as well as spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine\nconflict. While much of the economic fallout so far has been directed towards further disruptions\nto supply, both of these risks have implications for demand as well as supply. Assessing the\nbalance in real time will be difficult. Recognizing these risks is not an argument for stalling the\nremoval of accommodation, but it does suggest a steady, deliberate approach for the path of\npolicy could provide space to monitor developments as they unfold.\nAnother consideration for policymakers is judging how responsive economic activity is\nto the level of the interest rate. This responsiveness is likely to change over time and with the\nstate of the economy. For example, with consumption skewed towards durable goods, which tend\nto be more interest-sensitive than other components of spending, it is possible that higher rates\nwill have a more pronounced impact on the economy than observed in the past. On the other\nhand, high levels of liquidity in the economy and healthy household balance sheets might make\nconsumption more resilient to higher interest rates, requiring a steeper path of rate increases to\nslow demand growth and bring inflation down. A steady, deliberate approach to removing\naccommodation will allow policymakers to observe where this equilibrium might be.\nFinally, the interaction of higher policy rates with a large balance sheet will need to be\nconsidered. Raising short-term rates while the balance sheet continues to depress longer-term\nyields will contribute to a flattening and inversion of the yield curve. Already, as markets have\nanticipated a rapid increase in short-term rates, the spread between the yield on the 2-year and\nThe summary of estimates reported in Swanson (2021) imply that the Federal Reserve’s $6.9 trillion holdings of\nfederal agency and longer-term Treasury debt is depressing the 10-year Treasury yield by roughly 150 basis points.\n2\n\n5\n\n\f10-year Treasury bond turned negative yesterday. While many factors influence longer-term\nyields, including the growth outlook, foreign demand for Treasuries, and the quantity and\nmaturity of Treasury debt issuance, the Fed’s asset holdings also play a role. These purchases\naimed to depress long-term rates, and the roll-off of these assets is likely to put some upward\npressure on those rates, possibly steepening the yield curve.\nMy concern about an inverted yield curve does not reflect its intensely debated value as a\npredictor of recession. Rather, my view is that an inverted curve has implications for financial\nstability with incentives for reach-for-yield behavior. An inverted yield curve also pressures\ntraditional bank lending models that rely on net interest margins, or the spread between\nborrowing short and lending long. Community banks in particular rely on net interest margins to\nmaintain their profitability, with rural areas especially dependent on community banks.\nAs the FOMC begins the process of removing accommodation, not only will the policy\nrate need to rise, but the balance sheet will need to decline significantly. Negative real rates and a\nlarge balance sheet have distortive effects. For example, by owning roughly one-quarter of the\nMBS market along with a significant portfolio of longer-term Treasuries, our presence in\nfinancial markets muddies price signals, encourages excessive risk-taking, and can foster\nfinancial instability. Asset prices remain historically high and remain vulnerable to economic and\npolicy uncertainty.\nGiven the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment\nrate near record lows, moving expeditiously to a neutral stance of policy is appropriate. At the\nsame time, the factors I noted earlier, including monitoring risks, the responsiveness of activity\nto interest rate changes, and yield curve developments will be important guides to that pace in\nmy view.\nThe degree to which fading disruptions contribute to an easing of inflation and the lags of\npolicy actions will be relevant for what happens after more-neutral policy settings are\naccomplished. If at that point inflation shows signs of remaining elevated, more restrictive policy\nmay be required to meet our price stability objective and to reinforce an anchoring of inflation\nexpectations.\n\n6\n\n\fConcluding Thoughts\nThe start of a tightening cycle is always fraught with challenges. The public’s focus\nquickly pivots from asking “When will they start?” to “When will they stop?”\nThe previous tightening cycle initiated in December 2015 proved to be a difficult\ntransition. Although the initial rate increase was almost fully expected, it soon became apparent\nthat “expected” was not the same as “understood.” And it proved challenging to articulate a\ncompelling narrative for the path of policy throughout 2016.\nOf course, today’s policy landscape is quite different. The rationale for removing\naccommodation is not difficult when inflation is high, demand is strong, and the labor market is\nhot. Under those conditions, a soft landing is possible but not guaranteed. While an outlook of\neasing supply constraints and moderating demand growth is consistent with inflation stepping\ndown even as the labor market remains strong, less favorable outcomes are certainly possible. In\nthe event high inflation persists while demand turns down, and the labor market falters,\npolicymaker resolve could be tested.\nIf the assumption of temporary pandemic effects on supply and demand proves to be\noverstated, and the imbalance between strong demand and lagging supply persists, the potential\nto dislodge inflation expectations and price-setting dynamics will further complicate\npolicymakers’ task. Here the comparison to the 1970s is apparent, when persistently high\ninflation over several years led to the unanchoring of inflation expectations that then became\nembedded in price and wage setting behavior. Unlike that period, however, Fed policymakers\ntoday have emphasized a commitment to act expeditiously to restore price stability.\nStill, the landscape we face is murky. Uncertainty and risks seem likely to accompany\neach step on the path to policy normalization, demanding equal doses of flexibility and resolve.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJanuary 31, 2022\nThe Economic Club of Indiana\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThanks to the Economic Club of Indiana for inviting me to speak today. I’m pleased to be\nhere in person, something I no longer take for granted after the experience of the past two years,\nto share my thoughts on the economy during this extraordinary time.\nThe global pandemic hit the U.S. in full force two years ago and although its effects are\nstill with us, the U.S. economy rebounded quickly. Looking back, 2021 saw several notable\neconomic developments, including the largest increase in employment on record as well as the\nmost significant pick-up in inflation in decades. The effects of a global pandemic and the\nextraordinary policy response that followed, both fiscal and monetary, drove those outcomes and\nwill likely continue to set the course for the economy this year.\nI’ll talk about three key dimensions that will influence economic activity in the coming\nyear: the outlook for demand, the outlook for supply, and the outlook for monetary policy.\n\nThe Outlook for Demand\nThe outlook for demand is a positive one. Spending was robust at the end of last year,\nwith retail sales in the fourth quarter almost 20 percent higher than the same period in 2020, the\nlargest annual increase on record. With the new year, the sharp rise in Covid cases linked to the\nOmicron variant has muddled the picture somewhat. Real GDP increased a solid 6.9 percent in\nfourth quarter, but the surge in new cases has led many forecasters to revise down their\nprojections for the beginning of the year, even though there is a generally held view that\neconomic activity, and spending in particular, has become more resilient to spikes in the virus.\nMy own expectation is that the strength of the underlying fundamentals will continue to\nsupport solid consumption growth. Notably, household income continues to increase rapidly.\nNominal labor compensation has grown roughly 10 percent over the past year amid increases in\n\n1\n\n\femployment and wages. With a record 6.5 million people added to payrolls last year, more\npeople working means more income and more spending in the economy. This is particularly true\nfor the wage gains going to lower-income workers, a group that has traditionally spent a\nrelatively large share of their paychecks.\nDemand growth is also likely to be supported by healthier household balance sheets.\nSignificant fiscal transfers, along with subdued spending early in the pandemic, allowed many to\naccumulate savings and pay down debt. Households now have over $2 trillion in additional\nsavings relative to pre-pandemic trends, and buoyant asset markets, with both equity and house\nprices near record highs, have also boosted wealth. While it is possible that households could\ndecide to maintain a higher level of saving and liquidity following the volatility of the pandemic,\nmany have the capacity to spend.\nAnother factor supporting demand growth is a robust outlook for state and local\ngovernment spending. With sizeable transfers from the federal government, state budget\nbalances reached record highs in fiscal year 2021. And while fiscal policy at the federal level is\nlikely to turn contractionary as spending and transfers fall back from elevated pandemic levels,\nstate and local spending is expected to expand close to 10 percent in the current fiscal year, the\nlargest increase in 15 years.\nAlthough I expect overall spending to hold up, the persistence of the virus is likely to\nfurther delay a normalization of the skewed pattern of consumption we have observed over the\npast two years. Throughout the pandemic, consumers have favored the purchase of goods,\nparticularly durable goods. For example, additional time at home launched a wave of residential\nremodeling and upgrading with demand for furniture and appliances. It also inspired purchases\nof home exercise equipment and bicycle sales. Although durable goods consumption has fallen\n\n2\n\n\ffrom its peak, the level remains 10 percent higher than its pre-pandemic trend, and there are\nindicators it might be even higher if supply constraints weren’t limiting purchases. This is\nparticularly true for automobiles, where depleted inventories are likely weighing on sales.\nIn contrast to goods, spending on services remains considerably below trend, as\nconsumers continue to avoid in-person recreation, including live performances and movies, and\nhave cut back on visits to doctors and dentists. The same is true with business travel still\ndisrupted; hotels and air transportation remain depressed (though it might be hard to tell from the\nmiddle seat of an overbooked flight).\n\nThe Outlook for Supply\nTurning to the outlook for the supply of goods and services, 2021 saw supply lag demand\nfor many categories of consumption, particularly goods. The result was higher prices. With\noverall demand expected to remain strong, a key question for the outlook is whether supply will\nbe able to keep up, particularly as the ongoing public health concerns related to the pandemic\nthreaten to delay a rotation of consumption from an overheated goods sector to a relatively slack\nservices sector. Whether or not supply is able rise to the occasion in part will be determined by\nthe persistence of pandemic-related disruptions that have weighed on both product and labor\nmarkets.\nOne set of factors constraining supply relates to production bottlenecks and shortages,\nmany originating in the rapid closing and subsequent slow reopening of the economy in 2020.\nThe range of disruptions across factories and across countries has jumbled global supply\nnetworks, as have disruptions to transportation networks, including the carefully choreographed\nmovement of shipping containers around the world temporarily collapsing in disarray. Slowly,\n\n3\n\n\fthese disruptions are being dealt with, and there are indications that the worst has passed as\nshipping rates have peaked and port backlogs are being cleared. Imports and inventories both\nincreased sharply in the fourth quarter, suggesting that supply is on the mend. Reports of supplier\ndelivery delays declined in December even as they remain at historically elevated levels. Still,\nglobal supply networks continue to face risks, particularly those going through China where a\nzero-Covid policy and strict lockdowns are running up against the highly transmissible Omicron\nvariant.\nA lack of labor also has been an important constraint on supply. Speaking to contacts in\nmy region, reports of acute labor shortages are prevalent. These reports align with the data,\nreflecting the ratio of job openings per unemployed person near all-time highs and workers\nquitting jobs at a record pace. The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate falling\nbelow 4.0 percent in December and wage growth picking up solidly.\nThis tight labor market reflects the strength of demand but also constraints on the supply\nof labor. In December, the labor force participation rate remained 1.5 percentage points below its\npre-pandemic level and has shown little movement in recent months. Taking into account the\ntrend decline in labor force participation as the population ages, this amounts to a shortage of\nroughly 3.5 million workers. Understanding what is keeping these workers out of the labor\nmarket, and how persistent these factors are, will be important for determining how quickly the\neconomy will grow, as well as the split between output growth and higher inflation.\nSo why have workers left the labor market? The pandemic likely remains a key\nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly. In December, more than a million\nworkers reported not being in the labor force because of Covid, mostly prime-age workers and\ndisproportionately women. Throughout the pandemic, issues in childcare availability surfaced as\n\n4\n\n\fa key constraint on labor force participation, a concern that is only likely to be prolonged by the\nrecent surge in the virus and renewed school closures. Employment in daycare facilities remains\n10 percent below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that capacity still has some way to recover.\nHowever, it is not only children. Employment in nursing and residential care facilities has\ndeclined 12 percent relative to the start of 2020, suggesting that there has been a substantial shift\nin family care responsibilities towards households during the pandemic.\nAnother contributor to lower labor force participation has been a large increase in the\nproportion of the population that reports being retired. While these workers are largely not\nattributing their lack of workforce participation to the pandemic, I would not dismiss its role in\nelevating the retirement rate. Looking at detailed data, it appears much of the increase in the\nreported retired population does not reflect workers moving from employment to retirement but\nrather a sharp slowdown in the number of retirees returning to work. In normal times, there is a\nregular flow of retired individuals who move back into employment, in some cases out of\npersonal interest or in other cases out of necessity. Today, it appears as though more retirees are\ndeciding to stay retired, perhaps because of concern over illness or as buoyant equity and\nhousing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs and financial security. If concern over illness\nis a prime motivating factor, some fraction of these workers may decide to return to the\nworkforce as the pandemic fades.\nOf course, the pandemic has yet to fade, and the latest Omicron variant has the potential\nto prolong supply disruptions and to delay a further recovery in labor markets. We are already\nseeing some signs of its impact on the health of the workforce with absenteeism disrupting\nbusiness activity and production. This dynamic has been particularly apparent in the airline\nindustry, as a lack of employees led to the cancellation of flights and disrupted travel. It will also\n\n5\n\n\flikely weigh on labor force participation as potential workers remain on the sidelines waiting for\nthe situation to improve.\nThe ongoing influence of the virus has obviously added uncertainty to the outlook.\nHowever, I don’t expect it has changed the overall picture of strong demand continuing to push\nup on constrained supply.\n\nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy\nWhat does this outlook imply for the path of monetary policy? Monetary policy plays an\nimportant role in shaping the balance of demand and supply by either encouraging or moderating\nthe growth of demand. When demand looks to overwhelm supply, economic stability and longrun growth prospects are best served by a less accommodative monetary policy that moderates\nthe pace of demand growth. By smoothing out demand growth to allow supply time to catch up,\nmonetary policy can support the strong and steady expansion of economic activity.\nMonetary policy is currently providing a historic amount of accommodation to the\neconomy. With the policy rate near zero and inflation elevated, real interest rates, or interest rates\nadjusted for inflation, are near record lows. In addition to the low policy rate, the Fed has\nincreased significantly the size of its balance sheet, purchasing large amounts of Treasuries and\nmortgage-backed securities and more than doubling its asset holdings to nearly $9 trillion. By\nremoving securities from the market, these purchases apply notable downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates and lower borrowing costs. Asset valuations also respond as investors\nseek returns in alternative and perhaps riskier investments.\nWith inflation running at close to a 40-year high, considerable momentum in demand\ngrowth, and abundant signs and reports of labor market tightness, the current very\n\n6\n\n\faccommodative stance of monetary policy is out of sync with the economic outlook. At last\nweek’s meeting, the FOMC acknowledged the need to shift its policy settings with interest rate\nincreases and significant reductions in asset holdings on the horizon.\nRemoving accommodation is easily justified, but it is unavoidably complicated by the use\nof multiple policy instruments, as it was during the last normalization cycle less than a decade\nago. To guide this process, the FOMC released a set of general principles for reducing the size of\nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. These principles keep the federal funds rate as the primary\ntool of policy adjustments with planned significant reductions in the balance sheet to begin after\nthe policy rate had increased. The principles also reaffirm the Committee’s ample reserves\noperating regime and an intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long-run, moving\naway from holding mortgage-backed securities to minimize possible distortions in credit\nallocation.\nThese principles establish important guideposts as the Federal Reserve begins to dial\nback its policy settings. However, they are just a start, and a number of important and difficult\ndecisions remain. In particular, I expect it will be important to consider the interaction between\nreductions in the size of the balance sheet and increases in the policy rate. What we do on the\nbalance sheet will likely affect the path of policy rates and vice versa. For example, more\naggressive action on the balance sheet could allow for a shallower path for the policy rate.\nAlternatively, combining a relatively steep path of rate increases with relatively modest\nreductions in the balance sheet could flatten the yield curve and distort incentives for private\nsector intermediation, especially for community banks, or risk greater economic and financial\nfragility by prompting reach-for-yield behavior from long-duration investors.\n\n7\n\n\fIn the previous normalization cycle, the FOMC delayed adjusting the size of the balance\nsheet until the normalization of the funds rate was “well under way.” The rationale for this\ntiming was predicated on the novelty of balance sheet normalization and the desire for space to\noffset any unexpected turbulence. This rationale seems less compelling now and, from my\nperspective, discounts the yield curve implications of moving the funds rate higher while\nmaintaining a large balance sheet. All in all, it could be appropriate to move earlier on the\nbalance sheet relative to the last tightening cycle.\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, the principles state an intention to\nmaintain securities holdings in an amount needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and\neffectively in an ample reserves regime. I expect that this will be an amount that will be difficult\nto identify with any precision, particularly as the banking sector’s demand for reserves is likely\nto evolve over time, perhaps in ways that is hard to predict. While it might be tempting to err on\nthe side of caution, the potential costs associated with an excessively large balance sheet should\nnot be ignored.\nI would describe those costs in three aspects. One is the distortive effects of the size of\nthe Fed’s balance sheet on the financial system. A large Fed presence in markets can displace\nprivate activity, even in a market as large and liquid as that for U.S. Treasuries and certainly\nwhere the central bank holds roughly 1/4 of the MBS market. This presence can distort price\nsignals, currently most evident in the pricing of duration. By holding long duration assets, the\nFed’s balance sheet is depressing the price of duration, by lowering longer-term yields by as\nmuch as 1.5 percentage points according to some rules-of-thumb, incentivizing reach-for-yield\nbehavior and increasing fragility within the financial system. 1 As we purchased assets, our goal\nThe summary of estimates reported in Swanson (2021) imply that the Federal Reserve’s $6.9 trillion holdings of\nfederal agency and longer-term Treasury debt is depressing the 10-year Treasury yield by roughly 150 basis points.\n1\n\n8\n\n\fwas in part to artificially depress term premia, pushing down long-run rates and supporting\neconomic activity. In normalizing our balance sheet, we should aim to eliminate this\ndistortion.\nSecond, and related, maintaining a large balance sheet reduces available policy space in\nthe inevitable next downturn. With the zero lower bound likely to bind for short-term rates, the\ntrend decline in long-term rates has also decreased the amount of policy space we have at the\nlonger end of the curve. Just as increases in the policy rate provide us with space to cut shortterm rates, decreasing the size of our balance sheet, and increasing term premia, could provide\nspace to push down long-run yields in the next downturn. 2\nFinally, a large balance sheet has the potential to intertwine fiscal and monetary policy in\nthe public’s eyes and could unintentionally pose risks to the Fed’s independence and authority. 3\nIn a rising rate environment, this risk could become more apparent as interest paid on the large\nstock of reserve liabilities grows.\nWith these costs in mind, we are likely to face a different set of challenges and\nconsequential decisions than we did with our previous experience with balance sheet\nadjustments. In following through on these principles for reducing our asset holdings, the\ndifferences are notable, considering the current balance sheet is historically large relative to the\nsize of the economy, and the economy itself is in a far different place. In 2015, inflation was well\nbelow 1 percent; the unemployment rate was 5 percent; and the economy was growing just under\n2 percent annually. The balance sheet was half the size it is today. The starting point for policy\n\nMonetary Policy is one of many factors affecting long-term interest rates, including international developments,\nthe growth outlook, and the quantity and maturity of federal debt issuance.\n3 See “The Importance of Central Bank Independence,” remarks delivered virtually at the Conference on “Central\nBank Independence, Mandates and Policies,” hosted by the Economics and Business School, Universidad de Chile,\nOctober 21, 2021.\n2\n\n9\n\n\fadjustments in 2022 stands in stark contrast to the 2015 experience with high inflation, tight\nlabor markets, a robust demand outlook, and elevated asset valuations.\nEven as the pandemic continues to influence economic activity, monetary policy is\ntransitioning away from its current crisis stance towards a more neutral posture in the interest of\nmeeting its long-run objectives. Policymakers will need to grapple with the appropriate pace and\nsize of adjustments across multiple policy tools in the context of a changing and challenging\nenvironment. That transition could be a bumpy one, with the prospect of asset valuation\nadjustments and the recalibration of supply and demand towards a new equilibrium.\n\n10\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJanuary 11, 2022\nThe Central Exchange\nRemarks delivered virtually\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you, Ann. It’s a pleasure to begin this New Year with the Central Exchange. This\nis an important organization for women in Kansas City who contribute actively to our\ncommunity in so many different ways, and it provides an important forum to share ideas,\nexperiences and opportunities. The Kansas City Fed supports these goals, and I’m pleased that\nwomen play an important role on the Boards of Directors of our four offices, on our executive\nmanagement team, and across all aspects of our public mission. In fact, several members of our\nleadership team are members of the Central Exchange, and I know their involvement has\nbenefited them personally and professionally.\nIt’s also an honor to begin the New Year by continuing the tradition of sharing my\noutlook for the economy here at the Central Exchange, something I first did in January 2012\nshortly after I became president of the Kansas City Fed. It was a time of recovery in the U.S.\neconomy after a terrible financial crisis and Federal Reserve policymakers were deliberating on\nhow and when to unwind an extraordinary monetary policy response.\nA decade later, the U.S. economy again finds itself recovering from an unprecedented\nshock with Federal Reserve policymakers contemplating how and when to unwind an\nunprecedented monetary policy response. To be clear, the challenges we face today are quite\ndifferent in many respects even as the uncertainty that accompanies policymaking choices has\nfamiliar refrains.\nLooking back, 2021 saw several notable economic developments, including the largest\nincrease in employment on record as well as the most significant pick-up in inflation in decades.\nThe effects of a global pandemic and the extraordinary policy response that followed, both fiscal\nand monetary, drove those outcomes and will likely continue to set the course for the economy\nthis year.\n\n1\n\n\fIn my remarks this morning, I’ll talk about three key dimensions that will influence\neconomic activity in the coming year: the outlook for demand, the outlook for supply, and the\noutlook for monetary policy.\n\nThe Outlook for Demand\nThe outlook for demand is a positive one. Spending was robust going into the holiday\nseason, with November retail sales edging up following a large jump in October. Recent\nindicators point to continued strong demand even as the sharp rise in Covid cases linked to the\nOmicron variant threatens to muddle the picture somewhat. With newly reported cases now at\nall-time highs, many forecasters are revising down their projections for the beginning of the year,\nthough there is a generally held view that economic activity, and spending in particular, has\nbecome more resilient to spikes in the virus.\nMy own expectation is that the strength of the underlying fundamentals will continue to\nsupport solid consumption growth. Notably, household income continues to increase rapidly.\nNominal labor compensation has grown roughly 10 percent over the past year amid increases in\nemployment and wages. With a record 6.5 million people added to payrolls last year, more\npeople working means more income and more spending in the economy. This is particularly true\nfor the wage gains going to lower-income workers, a group that has traditionally spent a\nrelatively large share of their paychecks.\nDemand growth is also likely to be supported by healthier household balance sheets.\nSignificant fiscal transfers, along with subdued spending early in the pandemic, allowed many to\naccumulate savings and pay down debt. Households now have over $2 trillion in additional\nsavings relative to pre-pandemic trends, and buoyant asset markets, with both equity and house\n\n2\n\n\fprices near record highs, have also boosted wealth. While it is possible that households could\ndecide to maintain a higher level of saving and liquidity following the volatility of the pandemic,\nmany have the capacity to spend.\nAnother factor supporting demand growth is a robust outlook for state and local\ngovernment spending. With sizeable transfers from the federal government, state budget\nbalances reached record highs in fiscal year 2021. And while fiscal policy at the federal level is\nlikely to turn contractionary as spending and transfers fall back from elevated pandemic levels,\nstate and local spending is expected to expand close to 10 percent in the current fiscal year, the\nlargest increase in 15 years.\nAlthough I expect overall spending to hold up, the surge in the virus is likely to further\ndelay a normalization of the skewed pattern of consumption we have observed over the past two\nyears. Throughout the pandemic, consumers have favored the purchase of goods, particularly\ndurable goods. For example, additional time at home launched a wave of residential remodeling\nand upgrading with demand for furniture and appliances. It also inspired purchases of home\nexercise equipment and bicycle sales. Although durable goods consumption has fallen from its\npeak, the level remains 10 percent higher than its pre-pandemic trend, and there are indicators it\nmight be even higher if supply constraints weren’t limiting purchases. This is particularly true\nfor automobiles, where depleted inventories are likely weighing on sales.\nIn contrast to goods, spending on services remains considerably below trend, as\nconsumers continue to avoid in-person recreation, including live performances and movies, and\nhave cut back on visits to doctors and dentists. The same is true with business travel still\ndisrupted, hotels and air transportation remain depressed (though it might be hard to tell from the\nmiddle seat of an overbooked flight).\n\n3\n\n\fThe Outlook for Supply\nTurning to the outlook for the supply of goods and services, 2021 saw supply lag demand\nfor many categories of consumption, particularly goods. The result was higher prices. With\noverall demand expected to remain strong, a key question for the outlook is whether supply will\nbe able to keep up, particularly as the Omicron variant threatens to delay a rotation of\nconsumption from an overheated goods sector to a relatively slack services sector. Whether or\nnot supply is able rise to the occasion in part will be determined by the persistence of pandemicrelated disruptions that have weighed on both product and labor markets.\nOne set of factors constraining supply relates to production bottlenecks and shortages,\nmany originating in the rapid closing and subsequent slow reopening of the economy during the\npandemic. The range of disruptions across factories and across countries has jumbled global\nsupply networks, as have disruptions to transportation networks, including the carefully\nchoreographed movement of shipping containers around the world temporarily collapsing in\ndisarray. Slowly, these disruptions are being dealt with, and there are indications that the worst\nhas passed as shipping rates have peaked and port backlogs are being cleared. Reports of supplier\ndelivery delays declined in December even as they remain at historically elevated levels.\nA lack of labor also has been an important constraint on supply. Speaking to contacts in\nmy region, I hear consistent reports of labor shortages. These reports align with the data,\nreflecting the ratio of job openings per unemployed person near all-time highs and workers\nquitting jobs at a record pace. The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate falling\nto 3.9 percent in December and wage growth picking up solidly. The strength of the labor market\n\n4\n\n\fis even more apparent within some parts of our region, with the unemployment rate in Nebraska\ndropping to 1.8 percent, a record low for any state.\nThis tight labor market reflects the strength of demand but also constraints on the supply\nof labor. In December, the labor force participation rate remained 1.5 percentage points below its\npre-pandemic level and has shown little movement in recent months. Taking into account the\ntrend decline in labor force participation as the population ages, this amounts to a shortage of\nroughly 3.5 million workers. Understanding what is keeping these workers out of the labor\nmarket, and how persistent these factors are, will be important for determining how quickly the\neconomy will grow, as well as the split between output growth and higher inflation.\nSo why have workers left the labor market? The pandemic likely remains a key\nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly. In December, 1.1 million persons\nreported not being in the labor force because of Covid, mostly prime-age workers and\ndisproportionately women. Throughout the pandemic, issues in childcare availability have stood\nout as a key constraint on labor force participation, a concern that is only likely to be prolonged\nby the recent surge in the virus and renewed school closures. Employment in daycare facilities\nremains 10 percent below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that capacity still has some way to\nrecover. However, it is not only children. Employment in nursing and residential care facilities\nhas declined 12 percent relative to the start of 2020, suggesting that there has been a substantial\nshift in family care responsibilities towards households during the pandemic.\nAnother contributor to lower labor force participation has been a large increase in the\nproportion of the population that reports being retired. While these workers are largely not\nattributing their lack of workforce participation to Covid, I would not underplay the role that the\npandemic could have in elevating the retirement rate. Looking at detailed data, it appears much\n\n5\n\n\fof the increase in the reported retired population does not reflect workers moving from\nemployment to retirement but rather a sharp slowdown in the number of retirees returning to\nwork. In normal times, there is a regular flow of retired individuals who move back into\nemployment, in some cases out of personal interest or in other cases out of necessity. During the\npandemic it appears as though more retirees are deciding to stay retired, perhaps because of\nconcern over illness or as buoyant equity and housing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs\nand financial security. If concern over illness is a prime motivating factor, some fraction of these\nworkers are likely to return as the pandemic fades.\nOf course, the pandemic has yet to fade, and the latest Omicron variant has the potential\nto prolong supply disruptions and to delay a further recovery in labor markets. We are already\nseeing some signs of its impact on the health of the workforce with disruption to business\nactivity and production. This dynamic surfaced in the airline industry over the holidays, as a lack\nof employees led to the cancellation of flights and disrupted travel. The surge in the virus will\nalso likely weigh on labor force participation as potential workers remain on the sidelines\nwaiting for the situation to improve. While this new variant has added uncertainty to the outlook,\nI don’t believe it has changed the overall picture of strong demand continuing to push up on\nconstrained supply.\n\nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy\nWhat does this outlook imply for the path of monetary policy? Monetary policy plays an\nimportant role in shaping the balance of demand and supply by either encouraging or moderating\nthe growth of demand. When demand looks to overwhelm supply, economic stability and long-\n\n6\n\n\frun growth prospects are best served by a less accommodative monetary policy that moderates\nthe pace of demand growth. By smoothing out demand growth to allow supply time to catch up,\nmonetary policy can support the strong and steady expansion of economic activity.\nBy many metrics monetary policy is currently providing a historic amount of\naccommodation to the economy. With the policy rate near zero and inflation elevated, real\ninterest rates, or interest rates adjusted for inflation, are near record lows. In addition to the low\npolicy rate, the Fed has increased significantly the size of its balance sheet, purchasing large\namounts of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities and more than doubling its asset holdings\nto over $8.5 trillion. By removing securities from the market, these purchases apply notable\ndownward pressure on longer-term interest rates while pushing investors to look for alternative\nand perhaps riskier investments.\nWith inflation running at close to a 40-year high, considerable momentum in demand\ngrowth, and abundant signs and reports of labor market tightness, the current very\naccommodative stance of monetary policy is out of sync with the economic outlook. Even after\naccounting for the FOMC’s decision at its December meeting to accelerate the timeline for\nending asset purchases, the balance sheet will grow further until March.\nRemoving accommodation will unavoidably be complicated by the use of multiple policy\ninstruments – short term rates and large-scale asset purchases – as it was during the last\nnormalization cycle a decade ago. As policymakers chart a course for withdrawing this\naccommodation, it will be important in my view to consider the interaction between the ultimate\nsize of the balance sheet and the longer-run normal funds rate. All else equal, maintaining a large\nbalance sheet could imply a higher short-term interest rate to offset the stimulative effect of the\nbalance sheet’s continued downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. An approach of\n\n7\n\n\fraising rates while maintaining an outsized balance sheet could flatten the yield curve and distort\nincentives for private sector intermediation, especially for community banks, or risk greater\neconomic and financial fragility by prompting reach-for-yield behavior from long-duration\ninvestors. For that reason, my own preference would be to opt for running down the balance\nsheet earlier rather than later as we plot a path for removing monetary accommodation.\nIn the previous normalization cycle, the FOMC delayed adjusting the size of the balance\nsheet until the normalization of the funds rate was “well under way.” The rationale for this\ntiming was predicated on the novelty of balance sheet normalization and the desire for space to\noffset any unexpected turbulence. This rationale seems less compelling now and, from my\nperspective, discounts the yield curve implications of moving the funds rate higher while\nmaintaining a large balance sheet. All in all, I believe that it will be appropriate to move earlier\non the balance sheet relative to the last tightening cycle.\nEven as the pandemic continues to influence economic activity, the time has come to\ntransition monetary policy away from its current crisis stance towards a more normal posture in\nthe interest of long-run stability. With robust demand, high inflation, and a tight labor market,\npolicymakers will need to grapple with the appropriate speed and magnitude of adjustments\nacross multiple policy tools as they work to achieve their long-run objectives for employment\nand price stability. That transition could be a bumpy one, with the prospect of asset valuation\nadjustments and the recalibration of supply and demand towards a new equilibrium.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "Higher Prices: Supply Bottlenecks, Robust Demand, or Both? Lessons from Energy Markets for\nthe Broader Economy\n\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nNovember 5, 2021\nDelivered virtually at “Energy and the Economy: Opportunities and Challenges of the\nEnergy Transition”\nA conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for attending this year’s Energy Conference, hosted jointly by the Kansas City\nand Dallas Federal Reserve Banks. A lot has happened since we convened last November,\nincluding the widespread distribution of vaccines and a further reopening of the economy. The\nvirus continues its disruptive presence, though to lesser degree. For the economy, the key\ndevelopment has been a seemingly abrupt transition from a world of demand shortfalls to one of\nsupply constraints. Surging demand over the course of 2021, supported by aggressive fiscal\npolicy and accommodative monetary policy, has pushed on a supply side that continues to suffer\npandemic-related disruptions.\nThe combination of resurgent demand and constrained supply has pushed up prices, both\nin energy markets and in the broader economy. The price of oil has doubled over the past year,\nwith WTI increasing from about $40 a barrel to over $80 a barrel, while domestic natural gas\nprices have risen almost 150 percent. Aggregate inflation also has picked up significantly, rising\nto 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, the fastest pace in over 30 years and\nconsiderably higher than the 1.1 percent rate recorded last November. While higher energy\nprices have contributed to this increase, when its impact is excluded, inflation still remains\nelevated at 3.7 percent.\nWith increasing prices dominating headlines, the central question confronting economic\nforecasters and policymakers at the Fed is just how long this elevated inflation will persist. The\nanswer to this question depends fundamentally on how long the current tightness in the economy\ncontinues, and, in turn, the outlook for both supply and demand. While movements in energy\nprices are frequently attributed to supply developments, the importance of supply for broader\nprice movements had been increasingly called into question prior to the pandemic. A long period\nof lackluster demand growth following the 2008 financial crisis accompanied by muted inflation\nhad taken some emphasis off the role of supply constraints in determining the level of inflation.\nJust prior to the pandemic, the importance of the relationship between supply and inflation had\nreached a low point. After decades of viewing the relationship between the unemployment rate\nand inflation (summarized by the Phillips Curve) as a central constraint on how hot the economy\ncould run without sparking inflation, many questioned the continued relevance of this constraint.\nToday, I would like to briefly touch on the price dynamics in both energy markets and\nthe overall economy before considering what lessons the energy market might provide for the\n\n1\n\n\fconsideration of price dynamics in the overall economy, and then end with some thoughts on the\noutlook for monetary policy.\nRecent Developments\nAcross a variety of energy commodities, developments in both supply and demand have\nled to rapid price increases. For oil, a reopening economy has pushed up demand, with global oil\nconsumption rapidly returning to pre-pandemic levels, significantly lifting crude prices. Despite\nhigher prices, U.S. oil producers appear wary to ramp up production on the heels of the collapse\nin prices early in the pandemic. OPEC has also shown restraint, sticking to previously agreed\nproduction quotas, even as prices have climbed. The price moves for natural gas have been even\nmore dramatic, especially in Europe, where low inventories coming off an especially cold winter\nlast year and weak renewable production during the summer coupled with resurgent demand—in\npart as climate considerations shifted electrical generation away from coal—have led to surging\nprices.\nLikewise, we see the interaction of demand and supply dynamics creating price pressures\nin the broader economy. Fiscal transfers in the United States have supported incomes and\nspending. This has been particularly true for goods, as the pandemic led consumers to rotate\nconsumption from in-person services towards purchases for their homes. Strong demand has led\nto a remarkable increase in prices for durable goods, which rose over 7 percent in the previous 12\nmonths following 25 years of consistent price declines.\nSupply disruptions have also contributed to the rise in prices. Notably, shortages of\nsemiconductors have constrained output in a number of industries, including automobiles.\nSnarled global supply chains have pushed up shipping costs and disrupted the production of a\nwide variety of goods. Supplier delivery times have slowed dramatically, not only for\nmanufacturers but also for service providers, in part as shipping times from Asia to the West\nCoast have doubled, and transit costs have skyrocketed. The number of ships waiting to unload\nat Long Beach has become a commonly cited economic indicator. Inventories have been\ndepleted, with the retail inventory-to-sales ratio running 30 percent below its historic average and\nat all-time lows.\nThere are also widespread reports that a lack of available labor is curtailing production in\nmany industries, contributing to kinks in the supply chain and pushing up prices. A number of\n2\n\n\findicators point towards a tight labor market. Reported unfilled job openings are at record levels,\nwhile the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, a typical sign of a tight labor market, is at\nan all-time high. Wage growth has also accelerated, particularly for lower-income hourly\nworkers.\nIt is important to note that the tightness in the labor market could prove temporary as a\nsizable number of people, about 5 million, remain out of work relative to before the pandemic.\nThese workers are roughly split between those reporting being unemployed and those who report\nno longer being in the labor force. Non-college educated women with children represent a large\nportion of those that have dropped out of the labor force, suggesting that disruptions to childcare\nremain a barrier to work for many. In particular, daycare capacity appears to have fallen 10\npercent relative to pre-pandemic levels. A full recovery of the labor market appears unlikely until\nchildcare normalizes.\nLessons from Energy Markets for the Broader Economy\nWith the broad economy running into supply constraints to an extent that we have not\nwitnessed for some time, judging the outlook can be particularly challenging. Looking to the\nexperience of energy markets, where supply developments have long been an important\ncomponent of price fluctuations, we see several lessons that may inform today’s experience.\nOne lesson from the history of oil price movements is that it can be very difficult to\ndisentangle the role of supply versus demand. Prices are determined by the intersection of supply\nand demand, and the price impact of any particular supply disruption will depend importantly on\nthe underlying strength of demand. The sharp fall in oil prices in 2014 occurred against the\nbackdrop of both a rapid increase in supply associated with the growth of U.S. shale oil\nproduction and relatively weak growth in oil demand as the global economy continued its slow\nrecovery from the financial crisis. These two factors interacted to cut the price of WTI in half,\nfrom over $100 a barrel to around $50 a barrel, over the second half of 2014.\nAnother lesson from oil markets is that precautionary motives are an important\ndeterminant of current demand and prices. News of an actual or perceived supply shortfall can\nlead to a desire to increase stockpiles, amplifying the price increase from any given supply\ndisruption. For example, the OPEC shocks of the 1970s led to an increase in demand for oil\ninventories (and full gas tanks) which then helped maintain higher prices. Similarly, in the\n3\n\n\fbroader economy I am hearing anecdotes of firms responding to today’s supply challenges by\nover-ordering and accumulating precautionary inventories of the necessary inputs to production,\nincluding semiconductors and steel. As firms attempt to shore up their supply chains and move\naway from a just-in-time production model, the incentive to carry higher inventories could\nfurther support prices across a broad variety of goods.\nLessons for Monetary Policy\nThis history of energy price movements has informed the conduct of monetary policy. In\nparticular, energy price shocks have played a key role in developing the thinking around how\nmonetary policy should respond to elevated inflation, particularly inflation that appears to arise\nfrom supply developments. The oil price shocks in the 1970s, the run up in oil prices in the mid2000s, and the collapse in prices in 2014 all provide context for how monetary policy should\nrespond to inflation developments with an important supply component. In particular, experience\nwith energy prices has largely formed the basis for arguments that monetary policy should not\nreact to increases in overall inflation driven primarily by supply developments. I would\ncharacterize these arguments along two related lines. First, monetary policy should look through\ntemporary increases in inflation. Second, monetary policy should not respond aggressively to\nincreases in inflation resulting from a shift in relative prices.\nAlong the first dimension, given that it takes some time for changes in the stance of\nmonetary policy to affect inflation, it is often argued that policymakers should look through\ntemporary changes in inflation. It is this argument that led to the creation and widespread usage\nof measures of core inflation that exclude energy and food prices. Given the frequency of\ntemporary shocks to energy and commodity price inflation that are often attributed to supply,\ncore inflation is likely to offer a better measure of underlying or trend inflation and thus is\nthought to provide an important guide to monetary policy. This argument was prevalent in 2014\nand 2015 when a sharp decline in oil prices pulled down overall inflation, and the Federal\nReserve at the time argued that policy should look through this decline on the assumption that\nthe dip was temporary.\n\n4\n\n\fSecond, there is a large literature suggesting that monetary policy should not respond\naggressively to changes in relative prices. 1 The logic is that relative prices serve as important\nsignals that help to reallocate economic resources to sectors that are relatively tight from sectors\nthat have excess slack. Of course, this reallocation could be achieved with offsetting changes in\nprices, an increase in prices in the tight sectors and a decrease in prices in slack sectors, which, in\ntheory, could leave overall inflation about unchanged. However, in reality, firms in slack sectors\nhave often found that cutting prices, and particularly wages, is difficult. Thus, with incomplete\nadjustment in slack sectors, relative price changes often end up pushing up overall inflation.\nTheory suggests it is better for policymakers to accept this increase in inflation, which should be\ntemporary, than to tighten policy and restrict overall activity in an effort to force offsetting price\ndeclines in shrinking sectors. This argument was frequently made in the mid-2000s as oil prices\nrose steadily and lifted overall inflation, due to perceived shifts in supply and demand in the oil\nsector. Even as higher oil prices contributed to higher overall inflation, it was argued that\npolicymakers should look through this temporary increase in inflation rather than force\nadjustments on other sectors of the economy.\nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy\nHow might these lessons apply today? The timeframe for resolving bottlenecks and the\nscope of categories reflecting price pressures make the answer to this question less than\nstraightforward.\nDisruptions that initially appeared to be temporary bottlenecks driving up prices now\nlook as if they may be more long-lasting, with widespread reports suggesting that supply chains\nwill not recover until well into 2022. Additionally, while in the spring the increase in prices was\nbeing driven by select categories of goods and services, more recently the increase in prices has\nbecome generalized, and is apparent across a broad swath of the economy. Through May, both\nthe percent of consumer expenditures showing large increases in prices and the percent of\nexpenditures showing large decreases in prices were historically elevated. However, in recent\nmonths, prices that had been depressed by the pandemic, including hotel accommodations and\nairfares, have rebounded, even as prices for goods that have seen price spikes—for example used\nIncluding a paper presented at this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium. Monetary Policy in Times of Structural\nReallocation (kansascityfed.org)\n1\n\n5\n\n\fcars, appliances, and furniture—remain elevated. As a consequence, currently 50 percent of an\naverage household’s expenditure basket is now experiencing unusually higher prices.\nAs supply chains heal and demand eases, there is reason to expect inflation will\neventually moderate, but it is also clear that the risk of a prolonged period of elevated inflation\nhas increased. The argument for patience in the face of these inflation pressures has diminished.\nThis week, the Federal Reserve started the process of normalizing the stance of monetary\npolicy by announcing its intention to end asset purchases. The Committee plans to decrease the\npace at which it is purchasing Treasury securities by $10 billion a month and agency mortgagebacked securities by $5 billion a month, laying out a trajectory for ending these purchases by the\nmiddle of next year.\nIt is important to note that while the pace of asset purchases is slowing, the cumulative\neffect of these purchases is arguably the more substantive force acting on the economy. Since\nMarch of last year, the Federal Reserve has purchased more than $4 trillion of securities, pushing\nour total asset holdings to $8.5 trillion dollars. These asset holdings are depressing longer-term\ninterest rates most relevant for households and businesses and thereby are providing a significant\namount of accommodation. And, importantly, this accommodation will persist even when\ntapering is complete.\nAs the adjustment of asset purchases gets underway, the focus of attention will naturally\nshift to the path of the policy rate. Since last December, the Committee has stated that it expects\nto keep the policy rate near zero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with\nmaximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed\n2 percent for some time.\nTaken together, monetary policy remains highly accommodative in an economy where\ninflation is elevated and labor markets have yet to fully recover. With both supply and demand\nfactors clearly at play, the choices for policymakers will be complicated as uncertainty remains\nhigh for how temporary or persistent these frictions will prove to be.\nIn most circumstances, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives for maximum\nemployment and stable prices are in alignment, so that the Fed’s policy actions support both\nobjectives simultaneously. There are however times when the objectives can appear to be in\nconflict. And now might be one of those times with inflation running well ahead of its longer-run\naverage and labor markets appearing to have further room to recover. While the current\n6\n\n\feconomic alignment certainly adds complexity for policymakers, ending asset purchases is an\nimportant first step along the path to policy normalization as we balance our long-run objectives\nand seek to promote sustainable growth and financial stability.\n\n7\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 21, 2021\nDelivered virtually at the Conference on Central Bank Independence, Mandates and Policies\nHosted by Economics and Business School, Universidad de Chile\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for the opportunity to join you and to take part in this conference on central\nbank independence. History has shown that insulating central banks from the inevitable pressure\nof political dynamics is an important aspect of achieving economic stability for a country’s\ncitizens, even as domestic priorities support a variety of different institutional frameworks and\nstructures.\nIn my remarks today, I’ll focus on central banking in the United States, beginning with\nsome historical context on the Federal Reserve’s governance structure and institutional mandate.\nI will also describe the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s approach to achieving its mandate,\nincluding some thoughts on the role of financial stability considerations in the setting of\nmonetary policy.1\nThe Governance Structure of the Federal Reserve\nAt the time of the Federal Reserve’s founding, the United States had already witnessed\ntwo unsuccessful attempts at establishing a central bank, the First Bank of the United States and\nits successor, the Second Bank of the United States. There was intense political debate around\nthe creation of these two banks, as many Americans were skeptical about creating such a\npowerful and centralized institution. As a result, neither was able to outlast their initial 20-year\ncharter.\nIn the early 1900s, after a series of financial crises, a third effort was launched to\nestablish a central bank. Two overarching themes emerged during the deliberations of structure\nand governance: On one side were those who supported a decentralized structure under the\ncontrol of the private sector; on the other side were those who believed that the system should be\nhighly centralized under government control.\nEventually, Congress accepted a compromise proposal from President Woodrow Wilson\nto create a central bank with a combined public and private structure with those roles filled\nrespectively by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 12 regional\nFederal Reserve Banks. In this design, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the\nmonetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve, consists of 12 voting members: seven\nmembers of the Board of Governors and five Reserve Bank presidents. This unique\npublic/private structure is designed to provide a full representation of national interests in the\n1\n\nI thank Kansas City Fed Research and Policy Officer Huixin Bi for her assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n\fformulation of monetary policy, and it is my view that the Federal Reserve has been well served\nby the diversity of views inherent to its unique structure.\nThe Independence of the Federal Reserve\nI also believe that the Federal Reserve can best achieve its mandates as an independent\nagency that makes decisions based on the best available evidence and analysis, free of political\ninterference. That is, Congress sets the monetary policy goals for the Federal Reserve, but also\nprovides the central bank independence in achieving those goals. A careful reading of Federal\nReserve history, however, will find episodes when the independence of the Federal Reserve was\nundermined and that these were often periods when government spending was elevated.\nPressure on the Federal Reserve to implement policy supportive of government spending\ndates back to the early years of the central bank. During the First and Second World Wars, the\nFederal Reserve assumed a subservient role to the Treasury, and viewed its primary duty as “the\nfinancing of military requirements and of production for war purposes.”2 The Treasury made\ndecisions on debt management and the interest rate it would pay to investors, and then the\nFederal Reserve would absorb any public debt that was not purchased by investors at the fixed\nrate. After World War II, the Federal Reserve became increasingly uncomfortable with this\narrangement as inflation started to rise while interest rates remained fixed at a very low level.\nEventually, the Federal Reserve’s resistance to continually supporting government\nspending led to a formal accord with the Treasury in 1951. The Accord eliminated the obligation\nof the Federal Reserve to monetize the debt of the Treasury at a fixed rate. It did not however\neliminate political pressures on the Federal Reserve to hold rates low. The list of events includes\nsuch high-profile instances as pressure from President Lyndon Johnson to hold rates low as a\nmeans of supporting his proposals during the Vietnam War and to calls for Federal Reserve\nChairman Paul Volcker’s resignation during the Federal Reserve System’s successful, but\npainful, battle against high inflation in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, the Treasury-Fed Accord\nbecame essential to the independence of central banking and how monetary policy is pursued by\nthe Federal Reserve today.\n\n2\n\nSee “The Federal Reserve System: Its purposes and functions” (1947).\n\n2\n\n\fThe Mandate of the Federal Reserve\nThe Federal Reserve operates under a directive from the U.S. Congress that is widely\nknown as the Fed’s dual mandate: to foster economic conditions that achieve stable prices and a\nmaximum level of sustainable employment. The mandate, however, has evolved considerably\nduring the past century.\nAt its founding in 1913, the Federal Reserve’s central purpose was to “furnish an elastic\ncurrency” and “to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States.” 3 In the\n1940s, with the Great Depression in mind and the U.S. economy transitioning out of the\nproduction of wartime goods, Congress passed the Employment Act of 1946, which called for\nfederal government policy to “promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing\npower.” 4\nBy the 1970s, reports of sustained inflation and high unemployment led to the enactment\nof the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977. It explicitly set price stability as a national policy\ngoal and directed the Federal Reserve to “maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit\naggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential to increase production, so as to\npromote the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest\nrates.” 5\nIn general, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate for maximum employment and price\nstability is complementary. A strong commitment to price stability reduces fluctuations in\neconomic activity and helps achieve maximum employment and sustainable economic growth in\nthe long run. Occasionally, there are times when the goals are not complementary. For example,\nthe economy saw both high inflation and high unemployment in the 1970s. Not surprisingly, the\nFed came under intense political pressure during this period as it weighed the balance between\nits inflation and employment mandates.\nThe Recent Federal Reserve’s Framework Review\nAs economic conditions have changed over time, the conduct of monetary policy also has\nchanged. Most recently, in August 2020 the Federal Reserve concluded a monetary policy\n\nSee “Federal Reserve Act: Public Law 63-43, 63rd Congress, H.R. 7837.”\nSee “Employment Act of 1946.”\n5 See “Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.”\n3\n4\n\n3\n\n\fframework review that was launched prior to the pandemic. The purpose of the review was to reassess how to conduct monetary policy and achieve its dual mandate in a low interest rate\nenvironment.\nIn recent years, interest rates have fallen to historically low levels, not just in the United\nStates, but around the world. These lower rates, at least partially, reflect structural changes to the\neconomy, including higher savings by households and businesses in an aging society. Low\ninterest rates can pose a constraint on a central bank’s ability to stabilize the economy during an\neconomic downturn.\nIn addition, the link between the pace of economic activity and inflation appears to have\nweakened. In the years leading up to the pandemic, inflation remained persistently low even as\nthe unemployment rate neared record lows. This led some to be concerned that persistently low\ninflation could lead households and businesses to shift down their inflation expectations,\npotentially setting inflation on a downward spiral and further constraining policy space for the\nFederal Reserve.\nIn response to those changes, the Federal Reserve revised its monetary policy framework\nlast year along two important dimensions. First, in the absence of signs of sustained upward\npressure on inflation, the FOMC will not tighten its policy stance in response to low\nunemployment rates alone. Second, the Committee will aim to target an inflation rate that\naverages 2 percent over time. That is, in the case of inflation falling persistently below 2 percent,\nthe FOMC will allow inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for a period of time.\nIt is important to note that even with these revisions, monetary policy is conducted by\nway of a “framework” rather than a “rule.” This is important because the structure of the\neconomy evolves over time in ways that can be difficult to anticipate. The flexibility of the\nframework allows the FOMC to adapt to new circumstances and strengthen its credibility.\nThis is certainly true now, as the United States economy recovers from an unprecedented\nshock. With extraordinary fiscal support, as well as potential structural changes to the economy\nand labor markets stemming from the pandemic, economic dynamics could evolve quite\ndifferently now than in the past. The Fed is likely to best maintain its credibility by remaining\nnimble and attentive to economic conditions as we seek to achieve our dual mandate.\n\n4\n\n\fFinancial stability\nEssential to the conduct of monetary policy and the achievement of the Federal Reserve’s\nmandated objectives is a stable financial system. Prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve,\nU.S. banking panics were a frequent occurrence. To the founders of the Federal Reserve, the\nparamount goal was to create a monetary system that could respond effectively to stresses in the\nbanking system and serve as lender of last resort in a banking crisis.\nToday, financial stability isn’t in the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate, unlike the\nexplicit mandate provided to the Central Bank of Chile. However, even without a mandate, it is\nwell understood that financial system risks can impede the attainment of the FOMC’s objectives\nfor inflation and employment. A prolonged low-rate environment can increase risk appetites and\nraise asset values. Incorporating financial stability concerns into monetary policy deliberations\ncan help to build a more resilient system and to better achieve mandated goals.\nIdentifying financial system risks is clearly important; and difficult, given the constant\nevolution of the financial system and associated vulnerabilities. Technological change and\nfinancial innovation introduce new risks that require monitoring. From stablecoins to the risks\nassociated with climate change, judging the vulnerabilities that can derail financial stability\nrequires flexibility and nimbleness on the part of central banks. Equally important is\nunderstanding what tools exist to address financial stability concerns. Monetary policy settings\nare not well suited, in my view, to be the primary tool for maintaining financial stability,\nalthough the stance of monetary policy clearly has implications for financial stability. And while\nmacroprudential approaches are desirable in theory, deploying macroprudential policy in a\ntimely and potent manner, at least in the United States’ experience, has been challenging.\nConclusion\nEven as economies and financial systems evolve, the case for central bank independence\nis likely to remain strong. Domestic considerations and priorities will undoubtedly dictate the\ncontext and parameters of independence, but the benefits of separating decisions regarding the\nstance of monetary policy from political considerations are likely to serve the long-term interests\nof governments and their citizens.\n\n5\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 21, 2021\nDelivered virtually at the Federal Reserve’s Community Development Research Seminar:\n“Toward an Inclusive Recovery: Understanding and Empowering Women’s Economic\nParticipation”\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fI would like to thank all the speakers and participants for today’s lively discussion at this\nlatest installment of the Federal Reserve’s Community Development Research Seminar. The\nfocus on women’s labor force engagement is particularly important as the economy recovers, not\nonly for women but also for the economy as a whole. And so, I’d like to close today’s program\nwith a few thoughts on current labor market dynamics for women.1\nUnlike prior downturns, the pandemic has weighed more heavily on women than men.\nWomen with less education, especially minorities, lost disproportionately more jobs and exited\nthe labor force at higher rates during the pandemic recession. Mothers of young children have\ntaken a harder hit than fathers, which stands in contrast with the experience during the Great\nRecession, when participation paths for mothers and fathers were similar. 2 Lack of affordable\nchildcare options and lack of flexibility with work hours seem to be delaying a return to the labor\nforce for many women, especially minorities.\nWhen the economy reopened in the summer of 2020 there was a jump in the participation\nrate for prime-age workers – both men and women, but since then there has been little\nimprovement, with the rate remaining almost 1.5 percentage points below its pre-pandemic level.\nBut the largest and most persistent decline in participation has been among women, and in\nparticular women without a college degree. Compared to the start of the pandemic, there are\naround 1.6 million fewer prime-age workers in the labor force, including 1.2 million fewer\nwomen without a bachelor’s degree. Among these women, Hispanic women, who had the lowest\nparticipation rate before the pandemic, are furthest from a full recovery, with a labor force\nparticipation rate 8 percent below the pre-pandemic level.\nWhere did these women go? One likely explanation is that school and day care closures\nduring the pandemic created challenges for many parents, but especially for those with young\nchildren. A lack of access to childcare, the demands of home and virtual schooling, and health\nconcerns have kept many women with young children (age 13 and younger) out of the labor\nforce. A substantial body of research shows that, on average, working women shoulder more\nchildcare responsibilities at home even when they have a spouse present. So, when children had\nI thank Kansas City Fed Senior Economist Didem Tuzemen for her assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLofton, Olivia, Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau, and Lily Seitelman. “Parental Participation in a Pandemic Labor Market.”\nEconomic Letter. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. April 2021.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\fto stay at home because of school and day care closures, mothers often had to pick up the\nadditional childcare responsibilities.\nThe presence of young children has played an important role in the decline in noncollege-educated women’s participation in the labor force. At the onset of the pandemic, noncollege-educated mothers experienced a large drop in participation. Although participation in this\ngroup improved through the summer of last year, it fell again with the start of the 2020 school\nyear. Currently, only about 64 percent of these mothers of young children are participating in the\nlabor force, which is almost 6 percent below the pre-pandemic level. In contrast, the participation\nrate of non-college-educated women without young children declined less during the downturn\nand recovered more afterwards.\nParticipation rates remain especially depressed among Black and Hispanic non-collegeeducated women with young children, likely related to difficulties in accessing affordable\nchildcare. Enrollment in childcare programs dropped substantially when the pandemic hit in\n2020. Low enrollment and continuing health risks caused many childcare providers to shut down\ntheir businesses, especially those in low- and middle-income areas. As the economy reopened\nand the job market started to recover, anecdotal evidence suggests that many of these mothers\nfound themselves struggling to find affordable childcare programs in their communities.\nTemporary school closures and online schooling have also made it harder for mothers with\nschool-age children to return to work. The current low levels of participation among these\nwomen suggest that many mothers may not be able to sustainably return to work until children\nare consistently back in school and access to affordable childcare programs becomes available.\nThe pandemic has also taken a toll on college-educated prime-age women, with\nparticipation among this group remaining almost a percentage point below its pre-pandemic\nlevel. While the majority of pandemic-related job losses have been in occupations where\nworking from home was not possible, it was also true that work-from-home or “teleworkable”\njobs were not pandemic-proof. College-educated women experienced larger employment losses\nand slower recoveries in these teleworkable jobs than their male counterparts. 3 Moreover, recent\nsurvey evidence suggests that among those who were able to keep their jobs during the\npandemic, employees are feeling increasingly burnt out. This seems to partly reflect a feeling\n3\n\nTüzemen, Didem, and Thao Tran. “Were Teleworkable Jobs Pandemic Proof?” Economic Bulletin. Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City. Sept. 30, 2020.\n\n2\n\n\fthat they need to be available to work longer hours in a flexible work arrangement, with burnout\nseeming to escalate faster among women than among men.4,5 It is concerning that after the\nprogress of recent years more women in corporate America seem to be considering downshifting\ntheir careers or leaving the workforce. Not surprisingly, childcare responsibilities seem to be the\nmain reason why some mothers, especially those with young children, have thought about\ndownshifting or leaving work.\nThese dynamics have important implications for both women and for the economy as a\nwhole. Today’s headlines are filled with references to labor shortages and a lack of available\nworkers. With women showing the largest declines in participation relative to before the crisis,\nprogress on labor shortages will certainly depend on bringing women back into the labor force.\nAt this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium, an important paper by Bart Hobijn and Ayşegül Şahin\ndocumented that a recovery in labor force participation often lags an improvement in the\nunemployment rate. 6 This was apparent in the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, as it took\na prolonged period of a relatively hot labor market to bring many workers into the labor force.\nSimilarly, it may require a hot labor market to draw women back following the pandemic.\nAt the individual level, even temporary absences from the labor market can have\npersistent effects on one’s career trajectory and earnings potential. Today’s depressed labor force\nparticipation could also affect tomorrow’s progress on gender equality in the work force. We are\nalready seeing how the pandemic has changed the way we work, with hybrid work environments\nbecoming the new norm for many college-educated workers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that\ngiven the choice of working from home and returning to the office, women may be less likely to\nreturn to the office than men. Depending on how the workplace evolves, this development could\nexacerbate existing gender inequality in representation and career opportunities.\nPreventing this dynamic will be an important consideration for employers as we\ntransition to new ways of working. And I am hopeful that the insights from today’s seminar will\nhelp to create a more equitable economic environment that offers the tools, resources, and\nopportunities women need to thrive.\n\n4\n\nWomen in the Workplace 2021.

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nSeptember 24, 2021\nAmerican Enterprise Institute\nRemarks delivered virtually\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you, Steve, for the invitation to participate in this forum. I look forward to this\nmorning’s conversation with your panelists.\nWhen the pandemic took hold and widespread shutdowns were adopted in the spring of\n2020, it was immediately apparent that the hit to economic activity would be enormous. Less\ncertain was how long the shock would persist. Many workplaces sent staff home with the\nassumption that things would return to normal within a few weeks. Now a year-and-a-half later,\nnormal remains on the horizon. With the 2020 recession being both the deepest and shortest on\nrecord, the economy has bounced back sharply, while the return to normal continues to be the\nkey dynamic shaping the economic outlook.\nIn discussing the shocks to which the economy is now adjusting, I would include both the\nclosures and disruptions associated with the pandemic as well as the enormous fiscal and\nmonetary policy response that followed. The pandemic shock disrupted the pattern of\nconsumption by favoring goods over services. It also disrupted production, introducing frictions\nin labor markets and scrambling global supply chains. The policy response led to a spike in\nhousehold savings—as fiscal deficits funded transfer payments—and to a doubling of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet.\nIn many cases, these shocks—the pandemic and the policy reaction—were offsetting as\nevidenced by the rapid recovery of output and employment. However, in other cases, the\npandemic and the policy response conspired to push the economy away from its equilibrium,\ndisrupting long-run trends. For example, the ratio of goods consumption to services consumption\nis now far above its long-run historical trend. Similarly, the household saving rate jumped to an\nall-time high early in the pandemic, and, although it has come down, remains considerably above\nits average in recent decades. In both these examples, as well as others, it is reasonable to expect\nthat historical patterns will reemerge, with consequences for demand, employment, and prices.\nAs both the pandemic and the policy response fade, the pull toward normal will shape the\noutlook.\nThat said, while I am comfortable suggesting that the economy has not returned to\nnormal, I would not be comfortable suggesting that I know what normal will end up looking like.\n“Normal” is likely to be elusive for some time. The pandemic was a tremendous disruption that\nhas affected every aspect of how and where people work, where they live, and what activities\nthey engage in. Some of the changes coming out of the pandemic will persist and alter the\n1\n\n\fstructure of the economy. Of course, separating transitory from persistent is one of the central\nchallenges of economic policymaking.\nIt might seem odd to be discussing a return to normal when the Delta variant has pushed\nnew infections uncomfortably close to all-time highs. However, my sense is that,\nnotwithstanding the tragic human toll, the primary effect of the Delta variant will be to prolong\nthe return to normal, rather than upend the process altogether.\nIn the remainder of my time, I would like to discuss some of the key normalization\ndynamics I will be watching in the economy. Overall, I view these dynamics as supporting a\ncontinued strong recovery and further gains in employment, while simultaneously relieving some\n(though not all) of the price pressures that have elevated inflation in recent months. I will then\nturn to the outlook for monetary policy, including some thoughts on what policy normalization\nmight look like, and how the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) might\nshape that process.\nThe Economic Outlook\nOne dynamic likely to shape the outlook is the reemergence of long-standing patterns of\nconsumption, particularly spending on goods relative to services. With the onset of the\npandemic, restrictions and consumer caution led to sharp declines in the consumption of contactintensive services, such as hotel accommodations, concerts, and restaurants, even as homebound\nconsumers ramped up spending on goods. Though services remain a far larger component of\nconsumption than goods, their relative share has declined. For example, in the second quarter,\nconsumers purchased $1.80 of services for every $1 of goods, far less than the $2.20 they spent\non average in the years leading up to the pandemic. Over time as the pandemic’s grip wanes, I\nexpect old patterns to reemerge as audiences return to theaters, conferencegoers resume travel,\nand the Jackson Hole Symposium returns to Jackson Hole, for example. This return to normal\nwill pivot consumption back towards services and away from goods.\nThe rotation towards services consumption will be important for further improvements in\nthe labor market. Service sector jobs, primarily in leisure and hospitality and health, represent the\noverwhelming majority of the over 5 million jobs that have yet to return following the dramatic\nloss of jobs in March and April of last year. I expect a return of services consumption to lead to\nfurther strong job gains, with the caveat that the Delta variant could delay this rebound.\n2\n\n\fA pivot towards services will also take some pressure off the red-hot goods market.\nStrong demand for durable goods, exacerbated by supply chain difficulties, has been an\nimportant contributor to the overall rise in inflation. Over the past year, durable goods prices\nhave increased 7 percent, the first sustained break in an over 20-year trend of declining prices.\nAutomobiles, both new and used, have been an important part of this increase, but the prices for\nother goods, such as household appliances and recreational equipment have also moved up\nsharply. As consumption rotates from goods to services, some of the pressure should ease for\noverstretched goods demand, even as services growth continues to support the overall recovery\nin the economy.\nAlthough I expect an easing in the demand for goods, and a loosening of bottlenecks, to\nrelieve some of the pressure on prices, the data offer a note of caution. In particular, recent\nmonths have seen a rebound in previously depressed services prices even as goods prices remain\nelevated. For example, prices for hotel accommodations in the index of personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) are now 9 percent above pre-pandemic levels, even as spending on hotel\nrooms remains 16 percent below where it was prior to the pandemic. Earlier this year, PCE\ninflation was recording record levels of dispersion across categories of consumption. For\nexample, in February, categories representing 16 percent of PCE expenditures were reporting\ninflation far in excess of average, mostly goods, whereas 26 percent of expenditures recorded\nextraordinarily low inflation, mostly services. 1 By June, the percent of expenditures with wellbelow average inflation had fallen to 5 percent, while 51 percent of expenditures recorded price\nincreases far above recent trend. This is to say, that a shift in demand towards services could help\nease inflation pressures, but that a sustained step down in inflation is likely to also require a\nstabilization in services prices.\nWhy are prices for some services increasing rapidly even as demand remains weak?\nSpeaking to contacts in my district, a common explanation is the lack of available labor. Without\nworkers, supply is curtailed and prices rise. The labor shortage has developed as over 5 million\nfewer people are employed relative to before the pandemic. In large part, the current tightness of\nlabor markets reflects a dramatic decline in labor force participation that developed at the start of\nthe pandemic and has shown little improvement since. Despite the persistence of the decline in\nlabor force participation, I believe the pandemic shock remains behind a large part of the decline,\n1\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco | PCE Inflation Dispersion (frbsf.org)\n\n3\n\n\fwith a high likelihood of workers returning as pandemic-induced frictions, including concern\nover the safety of returning to work as well as disruptions to childcare arrangements, continue to\nease.\nThe pandemic shock has led many women to leave the labor force, disproportionately\nwomen of color without college degrees. 2 The absence of these workers from the labor force is\ncontributing to labor shortages in some services industries. Difficulty in obtaining child-care\nlikely explains some of the decline in participation. Tellingly, employment in daycare centers\nremains 10 percent below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that capacity in this important\nindustry remains impaired. As the pandemic fades, a normalization of childcare could bring these\nworkers back into the workforce, supporting growth, increasing employment, and alleviating\nsome of the labor shortages that could be contributing to price increases.\nAnother dynamic contributing to the fall in labor force participation has been an increase\nin the proportion of the population reporting being retired. Interestingly, research by staff at the\nKansas City Fed has shown that the rise in reported retirement does not reflect an increase in the\ntransition of workers into retirement, but rather a sharp decrease in the typical flow of retirees\nback into the workforce.3 Before the pandemic, every month a substantial number of retirees\nreported returning to work. It is possible increased health concerns during the pandemic\ndisrupted this flow. Here again, as the pandemic fades, it might be reasonable for this flow to\nonce again reemerge, adding workers to the labor force and further alleviating worker shortages.\nAll in all, my expectation is that a return to historical patterns of consumption, with a\nrenewed emphasis on services, and a recovery in labor force participation, with the return of\nchildcare and decreased health concerns, will contribute to an outlook for continued growth,\nless-binding constraints, and moderating inflation.\nThere are risks around this outlook, including the continued presence of the pandemic.\nImportantly, the effects of the upsurge in new cases could be as pronounced for supply as for\ndemand, prolonging the tightness of the economy and maintaining upward pressure on prices.\nRenewed concern over the virus could impede the recovery in services consumption such that\ndemand remains directed towards sectors of the economy that are near capacity and away from\n\nWomen without a College Degree, Especially Minority Mothers, Face a Steeper Road to Recovery\n(kansascityfed.org)\n3 What Has Driven the Recent Increase in Retirements? - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (kansascityfed.org)\n2\n\n4\n\n\fthose sectors that have available slack. The surge in the virus could also delay the normalization\nof the labor market, particularly if schooling and childcare are once again disrupted.\nAside from the economic threats associated with the pandemic, the high level of\nhousehold savings contributes an additional element of uncertainty to the outlook. Estimates\nsuggest that the stockpile of household savings has increased by close to $2.5 trillion. Of course,\nhealthy household balance sheets are positive for the economy, and, if the savings are spent out\nover time, this spending could support steady economic growth for some time. However, if\nhouseholds instead choose to spend rapidly, a rush of demand could keep the economy at\ncapacity, reinforcing bottlenecks and putting continued upward pressure on prices. Households\nhave a lot of firepower, and if and how quickly they choose to spend will be an important factor\nin how tight the economy remains. Of course, whether consumers choose to spend or save is a\ndecision directly impacted by monetary policy, so the speed at which any excess household\nsaving is spent down is not independent of our policy decisions.\nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy\nSince last December, the Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near\nzero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and\ninflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The\nFOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until\nsubstantial further progress has been made towards these employment and inflation goals.\nIn my view, the criteria for substantial further progress have been met, with inflation\nrunning well above our target and the unemployment rate at 5.2 percent, down 1½ percentage\npoints relative to December. Under these conditions, the rationale for continuing to add to our\nasset holdings each month has waned, and signaling that we will soon consider bringing our asset\npurchases to an end is appropriate.\nWhile recent public focus has been on the timeline for tapering asset purchases, the\ncumulative effect of these purchases is arguably the more substantive force acting on the\neconomy. Since March of last year, the Federal Reserve has purchased more than $4 trillion of\nsecurities, pushing our total asset holdings to nearly $8.5 trillion dollars. These asset holdings are\ndepressing longer-term interest rates most relevant for households and businesses and thereby are\n\n5\n\n\fproviding a significant amount of accommodation. And, importantly, this accommodation will\npersist even when tapering is complete.\nAs the adjustment of our asset purchases gets underway, the focus of attention will\nnaturally shift to the path of the policy rate. The ongoing effects of these asset purchases,\nalongside the presence of both upside and downside risks, will complicate the task of judging the\nachievement of criteria for raising rates. One might argue that today’s inflation dynamics are\nlikely to keep inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time and align with the\nCommittee’s threshold criteria. On the other hand, the criteria for judging maximum employment\nare murkier.\nWhile it is clear that we remain far from the historic low levels of unemployment\nachieved pre-pandemic, it is less clear to me that such a benchmark will be the best guidepost in\nthe current expansion. As I discussed, the pandemic introduced a number of frictions into the\nlabor market. Barring further intensification of the virus, I would expect these frictions to fade,\npromoting strong job gains and a relatively fast approach to maximum employment. However, I\nam open to the possibility that the pandemic has resulted in a number of structural changes in the\nlabor market. These changes could affect the assessment of maximum employment in ways that\nare not yet clear.\nPolicy Normalization\nBeyond interpreting the evolving economic landscape, policymakers also must consider\nthe implications of the multiple policy tools at play as we contemplate removing policy\naccommodation. While the shift from extraordinary policy accommodation to policy\nnormalization remains some way off, the linkages between balance sheet policies and the path\nfor policy rates will be factors in future policy deliberations. All else equal, maintaining a larger\n“normal” balance sheet should imply a higher “normal” terminal policy rate, as higher policy\nrates are needed to offset the stimulative effect of the balance sheet’s continued downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates.\nGiven the likely trade-offs between the policy rate and the size and composition of the\nbalance sheet as policy shifts towards equilibrium, several factors could affect policymakers’\ndecisions. For example, one question that might be considered is where along the yield curve\nwould we prefer the most policy space: at the long-end or at the short-end? If the zero lower\n6\n\n\fbound is thought to be a costly constraint on policy, there might be an advantage in pushing\ntowards a higher neutral policy rate, arguing for maintaining a relatively large balance sheet\nweighted towards longer-maturity assets. The accommodation provided by our balance sheet in\nthis case will have to be offset by higher policy rates, which in turn would provide us with more\nspace to cut rates in a downturn.\nWe might also want to consider the rationale for a smaller balance sheet, or at least\nshifting toward one with shorter-maturity assets, with a lower neutral policy rate. One rationale\nmight be a desire to decrease our footprint in financial markets. Another is that we might be\nconcerned about the slope of the yield curve. Raising rates while maintaining a large, longmaturity balance sheet is a recipe for inverting the yield curve, with potential negative effects for\ntraditional banking models. Commentators often discount the effect of an inverted yield curve on\nbanks, arguing that net interest margins are only weakly correlated with bank profitability. While\nthis might be true for the largest banks, it is not true for small banks. An inverted yield curve is a\nparticular headwind for community banks, promoting further consolidation in the sector and\nundermining the critical role that community banks provide in terms of local access to credit and\neconomic development.\nAs the economy recovers from this pandemic shock, its path is likely to confound our\nassumptions about what a return to normal might look like. The same is true for the monetary\npolicy normalization process. Both point to a long and difficult process ahead as the economy\nheals and the stance of monetary policy responds.\n\n7\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nAugust 11, 2021\n18 th Annual Economic Measurement Seminar\nNational Association for Business Economics\nRemarks delivered virtually\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for inviting me to participate in this year’s Economic Measurement Seminar.\nAs you well know, measurement and data are central to monetary policy making. Data are the\nvocabulary that policymakers use to build the narratives that are essential for making sense of the\neconomy and for explaining policy decisions. Data alone cannot tell the story, but the story\ncertainly depends on data. Consequently, the same data can often underpin widely divergent\neconomic narratives. As a policymaker, those narratives are shaped not only by an assessment of\nthe data, but also by experiences. Wisdom and the humility to adjust a narrative is essential,\nespecially when the data make the story increasingly difficult to tell.\nToday I would like to look at the data and narratives as they relate to a particular question\nwith important implications for monetary policy: Is the economy tight or slack? The strength of\ndemand and the ability of supply to meet that demand have been significantly impacted by the\npandemic and the related policy response. As I talk to contacts in the Kansas City Fed’s region, I\noften hear anecdotes that suggest an economy that has run into constraints, including reports of\nthe difficulty in finding workers and of having to pay much higher prices for materials and\ntransportation. These stories are confirmed by the data, with a record number of unfilled job\nopenings and sharply higher prices for many commodities. At the same time, almost 6 million\nfewer individuals are working now relative to before the pandemic. This suggests that there\nremains considerable slack in the labor market.\nSo, is the economy tight or slack? Prices are telling in making this assessment. An\neconomy operating near or at its productive capacity is likely to display higher prices. On the\nother hand, slack implies under-utilized resources, such that higher demand can be met without\nincreased prices.\nIn my remarks today, I’ll explore some of the factors that are currently contributing to a\ntight economy, which is lifting inflation. While there is good reason to think that many of the\nfactors boosting demand and restraining supply will fade over time, the extraordinary events of\nthe global pandemic make this unfolding narrative a complex one, not the least as the course of\nthe virus remains uncertain. Importantly, policymakers must consider not only near-term but also\nlong-run implications of their policy choices and be prepared to adjust as the economy evolves.\n\n1\n\n\fA tight economy\nYou don’t have to look hard to spot signs of an economy that has run into constraints.\nBusiness surveys are reporting a record number of job openings. In addition, workers are quitting\njobs at a record pace, typically a sign of a hot labor market when alternative opportunities are\nplentiful. Not surprisingly, many firms are reporting raising wages or expecting that they will be\nraising wages soon.\nStrong demand and limited supply are also apparent in depleted inventories. The\ninventory-to-sales ratio for retailers is at a record low and far below historical norms. The rundown in inventories has been particularly notable in the automotive sector, where the days’\nsupply of available vehicles for sale, at just under 30 days, is less than half its typical level.\nTight supply and high demand are behind the recent increase in price inflation. Prices, as\nmeasured by the consumer price index (CPI), increased 5.4 percent over the 12 months ending in\nJuly, matching June’s increase and remaining at the fastest pace of increase in over a decade. To\nbe sure, some of the increase in prices simply reflects a reversal of price declines recorded earlier\nin the pandemic, particularly for service categories like airfares and hotels. But the normalization\nof some prices is not the whole story. Other prices have moved far above pre-pandemic levels.\nThe sharp increase in car prices has been widely reported, not just as it relates to new cars but\nalso used cars and even rental cars. Indeed, durable goods more generally have experienced large\nincreases in prices, sometimes at the fastest pace in decades. Outside of consumer prices, there’s\nalso been a sharp rise in commodity prices and transportation costs.\nBased on this evidence, the economy shows clear signs of tightness. An important\nquestion is: Will this tightness persist with implications for the path of monetary policy?\nThe evolution of factors contributing to a tight economy\nWhether the economy is temporarily tight or more persistently tight will depend on the\nevolution of the dynamics affecting both supply and demand. Currently, demand is exceptionally\nstrong, boosted by expansive fiscal policy and low interest rates. It is also unbalanced, favoring\nthe consumption of a subset of goods. Supply is constrained by frictions in the labor market and\nproduction bottlenecks resulting from kinks in global supply chains.\nThere is reason to believe that some of the drivers boosting demand and constraining\nsupply will fade over time. In particular, I anticipate four factors that could introduce slack into\n2\n\n\fwhat is now a tight economy. After discussing these factors, I will turn to a few of the risks\naround this outlook, including the possibility of economic disruptions related to the Delta\nvariant.\nFirst, notwithstanding the upswing in the virus, I expect to see the continued rotation of\nconsumption from goods to services. More than a year ago, many consumers were forced to\navoid contact-intensive services, such as hotel accommodations, concerts, and amusement parks,\nas well as visits to doctors, dentists, and hair stylists. Stuck at home, consumers rotated their\nconsumption towards goods, often ordered online. This led to a very uneven pattern of demand.\nAt the end of the first quarter of this year, services consumption was 5 percent below prepandemic levels, while the consumption of durable goods was a remarkable 34 percent higher on\nthe same basis.\nThis unexpected shift in demand towards a subset of consumption goods has been behind\nsome of the observed tightness in the economy. For example, purchases of household appliances\nin the second quarter, including refrigerators and washing machines, were running 12 percent\nabove the level at the start of 2020, in part as the pandemic set off a wave of home remodeling.\nReports of long delivery delays proliferated as demand ran up against supply constraints. Not\nsurprisingly, prices for major household appliances have surged, increasing 14 percent in the 12\nmonths to June.\nWith the advent of widespread vaccination and a lessening of pandemic disruptions\nthrough the spring, services consumption has picked up, and goods consumption has stepped\ndown. Still, services consumption remains depressed relative to previous levels, suggesting\nfurther room to grow. As consumption rotates from goods to services, some of the pressure\nshould ease for overstretched goods demand, perhaps allowing inventories to rebuild, even as\nservices growth continues to support the overall recovery in the economy.\nA second factor is the likelihood that the growth of overall demand will moderate as\ngovernment supports fade. The tremendous amount of fiscal stimulus provided to the economy\nsince the start of the pandemic, on the order of $6 trillion, has been essential in supporting\neconomic activity. However, much of this stimulus has already been distributed, with the last\nchecks to households going out at the end of March and the Paycheck Protection Program for\nsmall businesses closing to new applicants at the end of June. Thus, the peak boost to growth\nfrom fiscal policy has likely passed. Some estimates show that fiscal policy, after adding almost\n3\n\n\f4 percentage points to growth last year, will subtract about 2 percentage points from growth over\nthe next few years. 1 Additional spending bills under consideration could blunt this drag, but\nseem unlikely to fully offset it.\nA third factor focuses on supply-side considerations contributing to near-term tightness in\nthe economy. As it relates to labor supply, temporary factors related to the pandemic are likely\ncontributing to the current tightness in the labor market, importantly reflected in a still-depressed\nlevel of labor force participation. Disruptions to schooling and daycare led many workers with\nsmall children, primarily non-college educated women, to drop out of the labor force. Enhanced\nunemployment benefits could also be playing a role, as potential workers sit on the sidelines and\nassess their options.\nAs schools reopen, and enhanced unemployment benefits end, these constraints on labor\nsupply should ease. Already we are seeing promising signs that the labor market is healing. The\nJuly jobs report, released last week, showed the unemployment rate dropping to 5.4 percent as\nthe economy added close to 1 million jobs. The labor force participation rate, however, remained\nalmost 1½ percentage points below its pre-pandemic level, suggesting further room for recovery.\nFinally, supply constraints go well beyond labor markets. A number of materials and\ninputs to production have also experienced bottlenecks, notably semiconductors and steel, but\nother aspects of production have been affected as well. In part, these shortages reflect the\ndifficulties of restarting or reorienting production after a year of sharp shifts in demand. The\nbottlenecks have also arisen from domino effects related to the tight logistical networks that were\nin place before the pandemic. With a flexible, dynamic economy, firms can be expected to\novercome most of these bottlenecks through the rest of the year.\nThis narrative for why the current supply and demand constraints might be expected to\nease over time strikes me as a reasonable baseline. My own expectation is that growth will step\ndown but remain robust; that the labor market will continue to recover at a rapid pace; and that\ninflation will moderate. But this narrative would be incomplete without acknowledging the risks\naround these assumptions.\nOne key risk is the lingering presence of the pandemic. The upsurge in Covid cases\nrelated to the Delta variant threatens renewed restrictions on activity or increased caution on the\npart of consumers and could delay the recovery across many dimensions. Importantly, the effects\n1\n\nSee, for example, the Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure (brookings.edu)\n\n4\n\n\fcould be as pronounced on the supply side as the demand side, prolonging the tightness of the\neconomy and maintaining upward pressure on prices. Renewed concern over the virus could\nimpede the recovery in services consumption such that demand remains directed towards sectors\nof the economy that are near capacity and away from those sectors that have available slack. The\nsurge in the virus could also delay the normalization of the labor market, particularly if schooling\nand childcare is once again disrupted. The spread of the variant has been particularly disruptive\nin Asia, where vaccination rates remain quite low. Given Asia’s large imprint in global value\nchains, disruptions in the manufacturing sector there can spill over quickly to other parts of the\nworld, further exacerbating production bottlenecks and shortages, and inflation pressure.\nAside from the economic threats associated with the Delta variant, the assumption that\ndemand will moderate may prove otherwise given the high level of household savings. In\nparticular, a considerable portion of the stimulus transfers to households have been saved, with\nestimates suggesting that the stockpile of household saving has increased by close to $2.5\ntrillion. Of course, healthy household balance sheets are positive for the economy, and to the\ndegree that the saving is spent out over time, this could support strong and steady growth for\nsome time. However, if households instead choose to spend rapidly, a burst of demand could\nkeep the economy at capacity, reinforcing bottlenecks and putting continued upward pressure on\nprices. Households have a lot of firepower, and if and how quickly they choose to spend will be\nan important factor in how tight the economy remains.\nThe outlook for monetary policy\nWhat does this mean for monetary policy and the Federal Open Market Committee’s\nlong-run objectives for the economy? How should policymakers account for today’s “tight”\ndemand and supply dynamics in their decisions about the path of asset purchases and interest\nrates?\nSince last December, the Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near\nzero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and\ninflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The\nFOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until\nsubstantial further progress has been made towards these employment and inflation goals.\n\n5\n\n\fWithout question, the combination of fiscal and monetary policy supports at the onset of\nthe pandemic bridged the economy’s transition from a deep contraction to a robust rebound.\nNow, with the recovery underway, a transition from extraordinary monetary policy\naccommodation to more neutral settings must follow. Today’s tight economy as I described\nearlier certainly does not call for a tight monetary policy, but it does signal that the time has\ncome to dial back the settings. With year-over-year inflation running well over the Committee’s\ntarget and steady progress in monthly employment gains, the FOMC’s long-run objectives for\nprice stability and employment are in focus.\nWhile recognizing that special factors account for much of the current spike in inflation,\nthe expectation of continued strong demand, a recovering labor market, and firm inflation\nexpectations are consistent, in my view, with the Committee’s guidance regarding substantial\nfurther progress toward its objectives. I support bringing asset purchases to an end under these\nconditions.\nAs this adjustment gets underway, public attention will naturally turn to timing for\nadjusting the policy rate, though it is important to note the timing of the tapering of asset\npurchases is not mechanically connected to the timing of any policy rate adjustment. With both\nupside and downside risks in play, and multiple policy tools in use, judging the achievement of\ncriteria for raising rates is more complicated. One might argue that today’s inflation dynamics\nare likely to keep inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time and align with the\nCommittee’s threshold criteria. On the other hand, the criteria for judging maximum employment\nare murkier.\nWhile it is clear that we remain far from the historic low levels of unemployment\nachieved pre-pandemic, it is less clear to me that such a benchmark will be the best guidepost in\nthe current expansion. The pandemic introduced a number of frictions into the labor market,\nmany of which are likely to evolve over time. Barring further intensification of the virus, I would\nexpect these frictions to fade, promoting strong job gains and a relatively fast approach to\nmaximum employment. However, the experiences of the past year may well have resulted in a\nnumber of structural changes to the labor market, including how, when, and where people work.\nThese changes could affect the assessment of maximum employment in ways that are not yet\nclear.\n\n6\n\n\fAs witnessed during the last expansion, it can take some time to draw individuals back\ninto the labor market. This is not an argument for keeping rates unchanged but ensuring\naccommodation adjusts as the economy expands, avoiding imbalances and instability that can\nderail such gains.\nNeedless to say, the road ahead to policy normalization is likely to be a long and bumpy\none as we navigate inflation and labor market dynamics in the post-pandemic economy.\nConsidering the financial stability landscape also will be key to the achievement of our goals.\nAlong the way, a careful assessment of the data will be essential in shaping the narratives that\nguide policy decisions, balancing nimbleness and patience and steering clear of policy errors.\n\n7\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMay 26, 2021\nOklahoma Bankers Association Annual Conference\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fI appreciate the opportunity to attend your annual meeting in person and to extend my\nbest wishes to Roger Beverage as he retires. It has been my pleasure to work with Roger over the\nyears, and his leadership to the banking industry will be missed.\nFor more than one year now, our nation has been confronted by a pandemic that has\ntaken a heavy toll. In addition to substantial loss of life and illness, our economy was also\nchallenged in ways that were without comparison in recent history. Now, thanks to the efforts of\nscience and healthcare, it appears we are on a path to return to normalcy.\nIn my remarks today, I will offer some thoughts on the economic outlook, as well as the\noutlook for banking. 1\nThe outlook\nSince the pandemic upended the global economy a little over a year ago, we have made\nconsiderable progress along the path to economic recovery. By many measures, the gaps that\nopened up in early 2020 have narrowed. Real gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest\nmeasure of the nation’s economic output, increased at a robust 6½ percent annual rate in the first\nquarter, and will likely surpass its pre-pandemic level this quarter. The unemployment rate, at\njust over 6 percent in April, has improved considerably from its nearly 15 percent peak a year\nago.\nThat progress alone is reason to be optimistic. Even so, we remain more than 8 million\njobs shy relative to pre-pandemic levels. While this shortfall partly reflects the still-elevated\nunemployment rate, another factor has been a decline in labor force participation with many\npotential workers sitting on the sidelines.\nAs we look ahead, I anticipate strong employment growth in the coming months,\nparticularly in contact-intensive industries such as hospitality and live entertainment, where the\nrebound in jobs has so far been incomplete. The outlook is also supported by an extraordinary\namount of policy stimulus, both fiscal and monetary. Fiscal transfers have led to a considerable\nimprovement in household balance sheets, with an accumulation of savings far in excess of\nnormal levels. In fact, the outlook is so strong that the discussion has quickly shifted from\ndemand shortfalls to supply constraints.\nI thank Nick Baker, Stefan Jacewitz, Blake Marsh, and Rajdeep Sengupta of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\fInflation over the 12 months ending in April, as measured by the consumer price index\n(CPI), increased to 4.2 percent, the fastest pace in over a decade and up considerably from the\n1.4 percent pace recorded at the start of the year. What the current pace of inflation means for the\ninflation outlook for the medium term is less than clear. Many factors that have boosted current\ninflation seem likely to fade over time. All the same, I am not inclined to dismiss today’s pricing\nsignals or to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for\ninflation. The past few decades saw inflation play a relatively minor role in the day-to-day\ndecision-making of businesses and consumers. Maintaining this state of affairs as we seek to\nachieve our objectives for maximum employment and price stability will be important.\nAs the pace and strength of the recovery unfolds, monetary policy settings remain highly\naccommodative and will remain so for some time in line with the FOMC’s forward guidance.\nThe Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near zero until the labor market\nhas reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and\nis on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also expects to maintain its\npurchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until substantial further progress has\nbeen made towards these employment and inflation goals.\nJudging the appropriate timing for policy adjustments is always challenging. The\neconomy is an incredibly complex set of relationships, many of which have been disrupted by\nthe pandemic with uncertain long-term consequences. This is true for how we consume, how we\nproduce, and how we work. As the economy works its way towards a new equilibrium,\npolicymakers will be well served to take a flexible approach to monetary policy decisions, in my\nview. In this regard, the Federal Reserve’s revised framework for monetary policy, adopted last\nAugust, provides a “framework,” rather than a “rule.” The FOMC has in the past avoided strict\nadherence to monetary policy rules, so it is unsurprising that the revised framework is not a\nprecise prescription for policy action even as it repositions the Federal Reserve’s approach to\nachieving its congressional mandates for employment and inflation.\nThe structure of the economy changes over time, and it will be important to adapt to new\ncircumstances rather than adhere to a rigid formulation of policy reactions. With a tremendous\namount of fiscal stimulus flowing through the economy, the landscape could unfold quite\ndifferently than the one that shaped the thinking around the revised monetary policy framework.\nThat suggests remaining nimble and attentive to these dynamics will be important as we seek to\n2\n\n\fachieve our policy objectives in the context of sustainable economic growth and the well-being\nof the American public.\nThe role of banks in the recovery\nThe banking industry has of course also played a key role in the recovery to date. Banks\nwere vital in keeping the economy going in the early days of the pandemic. As investors fled to\nthe safety of cash and other liquid assets, financial markets witnessed a liquidity squeeze that\nwas particularly acute in short-term funding markets. Banks were well situated to withstand this\nliquidity squeeze. 2 Crucially, their resilience reflected strong liquidity and capital positions and\nmassive economic support from the government. As a result, banks were not only able to\nprovision for anticipated losses from the pandemic, but also to continue lending during the early\ndays of the pandemic. Banks provided around $270 billion in withdrawals on existing lines of\ncredit to businesses in the first quarter of 2020 to cover anticipated revenue shortfalls. 3\nWhile the initial pandemic policy response of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve\naddressed the liquidity squeeze in March 2020, subsequent policy actions have pivoted from\ncontaining a potential financial crisis to addressing the challenges of supplying new credit to the\nbusinesses and households hardest hit by the pandemic. Banks have been a critical conduit for\nthese policy measures. Most notably, banks disbursed funds to small businesses that were hard\nhit by the pandemic through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). As of May 2, 2021, over\n5,000 lenders have approved close to 11 million loans under the PPP, totaling $780 billion in\nfunds to eligible small and medium-sized businesses. 4 Regional and community banks have been\nparticularly active participants in the program. PPP loans make up more than a quarter of\noutstanding C&I loans at regional banks and around 40 percent at community banks—\nsignificantly more than large banking organizations (LBOs). This is a massive program, and its\nability to reach critical corners of the economy has depended on the strength of the relationships\nthat community and regional banks built over years of work with small, local businesses in their\ncommunities.\n\nRajdeep Sengupta and Fei Xue, 2020. \"The Global Pandemic and Run on Shadow Banks,\" Economic Bulletin,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 11, 2020.\n3\nThe data reported are end-of-quarter changes in unused commitments for banks between Q4:2019 and Q1:2020.\nAnecdotal evidence would suggest that most of the draws occurred late in the first quarter of 2020.\n4\nhttps://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-data\n2\n\n3\n\n\fThe sheer size of the economic policy response to the pandemic, however, has created\ncertain challenges for banks. Bank deposits have increased dramatically. At the same time, fiscal\ntransfers have weighed on loan demand. While small businesses have obtained much-needed\nfunding through the PPP program, most large corporate firms have been able to take advantage\nof easing credit conditions in bond financing. Federal aid packages have helped households\nrepay debt, boost savings and improve credit scores—complementing a decade-long cycle of\ndeleveraging by households from the peak of the 2008 financial crisis. As a result of this rapid\nand broad turnaround in credit conditions, demand for more credit, especially for bank loans, has\nbeen reduced. Facing low loan demand, banks have used much of their increased deposit funding\nto acquire low-yielding, liquid securities, which has weighed on overall bank profitability.\nAs the recovery from the pandemic continues, loan demand is likely to increase, and\nbanks will find new lending opportunities. Indeed, demand for auto lending, for example, has\npicked up recently. However, total loan growth—and particularly business lending growth\noutside the PPP program—remains tepid despite bank standards easing as economic uncertainty\nhas abated. Pressure to raise profitability could increase.\nImplications for risk-taking and bank capital\nEven if loan volumes do pick up appreciably, profitability is likely to remain a concern.\nWith interest rates expected to remain low for some time, profitability measures, such as net\ninterest margins, will continue to be compressed. The pressure to boost profitability can result in\nturning to other, possibly riskier, alternatives to bolster returns.\nThe link between profitability and risk-taking is not always clear cut, but the search for\nhigher returns can understandably have negative consequences for the banking system and the\neconomy more broadly. Some research argues that when a bank’s incentives are well aligned,\npreserving value can limit risk-taking. 5 Such incentives may come under pressure in today’s\nenvironment where lower profitability might encourage risk-taking, whether by increasing\n\nDemsetz, Rebecca, Mark R. Saidenberg, and Philip E. Strahan, 1996, “Banks with Something to Lose: The\nDisciplinary Role of the Franchise Value,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, 2(2), 114; among others.\n5\n\n4\n\n\fduration in asset portfolios, by loosening underwriting standards to compete for loans, or by\nexpanding into new or riskier lines of business.\nDespite loan demand uncertainties, bank earnings during the first quarter of this year\nhave been positive, benefitting in large part from the release of loan loss reserves, particularly for\nlarger banks. Banks also have become more reliant on non-interest income sources. However,\nrecent events around Archegos Capital and Greensill Capital are reminders of the impact of\nidiosyncratic losses and the ongoing value of risk management and strong capital. Both opaque,\ncomplex transactions or those with seemingly well-understood risks can lead to unexpected\nlosses.\nRegulatory reforms enhanced capital rules in response to the 2008 financial crisis, in part\nto protect against risks that are not well understood. These rules strengthened requirements for\nthe amount and quality of capital in systemically significant banks and undoubtedly contributed\nto stability in the banking industry as the global pandemic unfolded. Our largest banks, those\nlabeled GSIBs (global systemically important banks) entered the pandemic with capital levels\nwell above those leading into the last crisis. However, in terms of leverage ratios, community\nand regional banks continue to hold even more capital than GSIBs. 6\nThe fundamentals of strong capital and robust risk management will remain important as\nthe economic recovery advances and banks resume dividend payments and share repurchases.\nResisting an excessive focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term interests will be\nkey. 7 The full effect of the pandemic on bank portfolios is still unknown, and with so much\nuncertain, there are benefits to a longer-term view of capital.\nA shifting financial sector landscape\nEven as the banking industry manages through the aftermath of the pandemic, banks also\nare responding to strategic shifts in the broader financial sector landscape. The nation’s banking\nsystem across all sizes—large, small, and regional—has historically been the driver of financial\nservices for consumers and businesses. However, technology and innovation also have a long\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s semi-annual updates on Bank Capital Analysis (BCA) judges capital\nstrength across the banking industry. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate Tier 1 leverage ratios for global\nsystemically important banks (GSIBs) was 7.5 compared to 9.1 for RBOs and 10.0 for CBOs.\n7\nFor definitions of short-termism, see Sheila Bair, “Lessons of the Financial Crisis: The Dangers of ShortTermism,” Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance & Financial Regulation, Monday, July 4, 2011, or\nhttps://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/issues/short-termism.\n6\n\n5\n\n\fhistory of joining forces to disrupt existing conventions. Similar to the proliferation of nonbank\nlenders, we now see this dynamic playing out in today’s financial system as it relates to\nfacilitating payments. In essence, the unbundling of traditional banking services poses new\nquestions for a legal and regulatory framework that has positioned the banking system to support\nmonetary policy transmission, financial stability and consumer protections.\nThe ability to send money with the speed and convenience of an email is appealing and\nunderstandably gaining rapid adoption. Indeed, we’ve witnessed over the past year an increased\nadoption of digital payments. Yet we can’t overlook that despite efforts to make payments faster,\nless costly, and broadly accessible, nonbank entrants into financial services operate largely\noutside our existing institutional and regulatory frameworks. In some cases, novel charters at the\nstate and federal level have emerged to conduct these activities with new forms of money and\ncustomized regulatory frameworks.\nTo what extent our existing legal and regulatory frameworks will need to evolve is\nunclear. The characteristics associated with commercial banks have generally assumed access to\nthe public safety net of federal deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve’s discount window\nwith a state/federal regulatory framework and direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payments\nrails. 8 State and federal regulators collectively should consider how these fintechs and payment\nplatforms fit into the banking system.\nToday’s accelerating pace of technological change has implications for our financial\nsystem. But what hasn’t changed are the Federal Reserve’s priorities for the payment system:\nsafety, accessibility and efficiency. It is through this lens that the Federal Reserve remains\ncommitted to its goal to deliver its first new payment service in over 40 years, the FedNow\nService. The FedNow Service is a high priority for the Federal Reserve and will lay a foundation\nfor the future of payments that can be used as a springboard for innovation and yield important\neconomic benefits for the public. We are taking a phased approach in developing the FedNow\nService so we can bring initial releases to market as quickly as possible, while providing\nflexibility to add key features in future releases. We continue to collaborate with the industry and\nhave established a FedNow Community for those interested in helping evolve the development\n\nOn May 5, 2021, the Federal Reserve Board invited comment on proposed guidelines to evaluate requests for\naccounts and payments services at Federal Reserve Banks:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210505a.htm.\n\n8\n\n6\n\n\fof the FedNow Service. If you aren’t already a member and would like to join, you can visit the\nFRBservices.org website 9 for more information.\nNew entrants and new business models will continue to disrupt and reshape the financial\nservices industry. Bank strategies for the future are taking a fresh look at providing payments\nservices, including innovation through new services, such as FedNow, or new partnerships with\nfintechs and other financial services providers. Your customers’ changing needs and preferences\nwill be key to the strategies you pursue, as they have been for decades.\n\n9\n\nhttps://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow/community/index.html\n\n7\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMay 24, 2021\nDelivered virtually at “The Roots of Agricultural Productivity,”\nThe Kansas City Fed’s 2021 Agricultural Symposium\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for participating in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Agricultural\nSymposium. Now in its 11th year, the symposium offers an opportunity for academics,\npolicymakers, lenders and practitioners to gather and discuss important topics related to\nagricultural economics. We are proud to sponsor this look at a sector so vital to our region, the\nnation and the global economy and to engage with you in this virtual format.\nThis year’s theme focuses on agricultural productivity growth. Producers and consumers\nof agricultural products alike benefit from productivity growth, and it has particular relevance\nnow as strong increases in demand for agricultural products coincide with a run-up in crop\nprices. Over the long run, productivity growth is a key determinant in whether increased demand\nwill be met by higher supply or if prices will have to rise to dampen the strength of demand.\nThe importance of productivity growth extends well beyond agriculture, of course. It\nplays an essential role in the long-run pace of economic growth, as well as the living standards\nand incomes of households. Productivity growth also lies at the intersection of demand growth\nand price inflation—a relationship that is attracting quite a bit of attention these days. In my\nremarks this afternoon, I’ll talk about the role of productivity growth as a consideration for the\nnation’s economic outlook, and consequently, the outlook for monetary policy.\nThe economic outlook\nSince the pandemic upended the global economy a little over a year ago, we have made\nconsiderable progress along the path to economic recovery. By many measures, the gaps that\nopened up in early 2020 have narrowed. Real gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest\nmeasure of the nation’s economic output, increased at a robust 6½ percent annual rate in the first\nquarter, and will likely surpass its pre-pandemic level this quarter. The unemployment rate, at\njust over 6 percent in April, has improved considerably from its nearly 15 percent peak a year\nago.\nThat progress alone is reason to be optimistic. Even so, we remain more than 8 million\njobs shy relative to pre-pandemic levels. While this shortfall partly reflects the still-elevated\nunemployment rate, another factor has been a decline in labor force participation with many\npotential workers sitting on the sidelines.\nAs we look ahead, I anticipate strong employment growth in the coming months,\nparticularly in contact-intensive industries such as hospitality and live entertainment, where the\n1\n\n\frebound in jobs has so far been incomplete. The outlook is also supported by an extraordinary\namount of policy stimulus, both fiscal and monetary. Fiscal transfers have led to a considerable\nimprovement in household balance sheets, with an accumulation of savings far in excess of\nnormal levels. In fact, the outlook is so strong that the discussion has quickly shifted from\ndemand shortfalls to supply constraints.\nKey questions for the outlook\nIn gauging the economy’s progress, I see three big, and somewhat sequential, questions\nthat policymakers will grapple with over coming months. First, how actively will consumers\nspend down the excess savings that many households accumulated during the pandemic?\nSecond, will limited supply and bottlenecks constrain this urge to spend, or will production,\npossibly supported by productivity growth, be able to keep up with a rush in demand? And third,\nif strong demand runs up against production constraints, will the effect be a temporary increase\nin prices and inflation, or a more persistent change in price-setting behavior of businesses?\nStarting with the outlook for household spending, healthy balance sheets suggest that\nhouseholds have the capacity to spend. If and how quickly households spend down their excess\nsavings will likely be an important determinant of the pace of growth over the next few years.\nWhile households could draw down their savings quickly, several factors suggest that people\nmay want to hang on to at least a portion of their accumulated savings. Households are now\npainfully aware of new economic risks that might not have been a consideration a little over a\nyear ago. With this recent experience of an economic shutdown, they may wish to keep higher\namounts of liquid assets relative to the past. Also, since the fiscal transfers have largely been\ntemporary, consumers might not want to materially change their spending decisions in response\nto only a short-lived increase in income.\nOn the second question, will supply constraints impede growth? We are certainly hearing\nanecdotal evidence to this effect, with labor, materials and transportation services reported as\nbeing in short supply. For labor, this shortage reflects the still-depressed level of labor force\nparticipation that I discussed earlier. How quickly supply can grow to meet higher demand will\nlikely, at least in part, depend on the factors that are behind the decline in labor force\nparticipation. Some of the fall is likely due to the pandemic, either through restrictions on\nactivity, lack of childcare, enhanced unemployment benefits, or fear of contagion. As the\n2\n\n\fpandemic fades and time passes, these factors will reverse, and labor constraints should ease.\nHowever, it is also possible that some of the decline in participation reflects a growing\ndetachment from work for some, especially after the disruptions of the last year. This might be\nparticularly true for workers that were near retirement. In this case, it will likely take a period of\nstrong growth to draw these workers back in.\nWith respect to the widespread materials and transportation shortages, some may resolve\nduring the remainder of the year, but others are likely to persist beyond that. For example, the\nshift in demand from services to goods during the pandemic has led to a surge in imports,\nbacking up traffic at U.S. ports. The resulting longer shipping times have led to a global shortage\nof intermodal containers that many in the agricultural industry have likely experienced. A shift in\nconsumption patterns back to services may help alleviate these delays, but it’s not yet clear when\nthat may occur. For manufacturers, surging demand for commodity computer chips has run up\nagainst global capacity constraints, which require long lead times to expand.\nProductivity growth has the potential to play a role in meeting any incipient rush in\ndemand. By allowing higher output with the same inputs, productivity can loosen the capacity\nand labor constraints that could stifle demand and weigh on economic growth.\nPredicting the evolution of productivity, however, can be difficult. Measured by output\nper hour of work, productivity jumped during the pandemic, averaging close to 4 percent at an\nannual rate over the past year, more than triple the average pace over the last decade. However,\nmuch of this acceleration seems likely to reverse as restaurants reopen and hotels return to full\ncapacity given their relatively low measured productivity.\nBut it is also possible that certain adaptations made during the pandemic, as well as\nbehavioral changes on the part of consumers, could lead to a persistent increase in worker\nproductivity. For example, over the past year, restaurants saw their customers shift towards\ncurbside pickup or home delivery options. By adapting to this shift, restaurants were able to\nproduce a similar product with less labor input. Similarly, the pandemic has led organizations to\nrethink the role of business travel in their operations. Travel is an expensive input for many\nbusinesses, and a shift towards far cheaper digital interactions could lead to significant cost\nsavings and increased productivity. On the other hand, one could argue that hosting a conference\nlike this on Zoom is a poor substitute for in-person engagement and could perhaps even depress\nproductivity. This is all to say, that a lot remains to be sorted out regarding the pandemic’s effect\n3\n\n\fon productivity. More generally, tight labor markets often incentivize productivity-enhancing\ninnovation. For example, you see this at retail stores, where self-checkout has become\nincreasingly common.\nTurning to the third question, how will the dynamics of a strong economy and supply\nconstraints affect inflation? Inflation over the 12 months ending in April, as measured by the\nconsumer price index (CPI), increased to 4.2 percent, the fastest pace in over a decade and up\nconsiderably from the 1.4 percent pace recorded at the start of the year. What the current pace of\ninflation means for the inflation outlook for the medium term is less than clear. Many factors that\nhave boosted current inflation seem likely to fade over time. For example, the average price of a\ngallon of gasoline fell to $1.87 last April as demand fell sharply and inventories accumulated\nrapidly. Remarkably, these factors actually pushed the spot price of oil below zero for a moment\nlast year. This April, as demand has recovered with a reopening economy, the average price per\ngallon hit $2.96, an almost 60 percent increase from a year earlier, but about equal to the average\nprice over the previous 10 years. This normalization in the price of gasoline contributed almost a\npercentage point to the overall rate of inflation in April.\nGasoline of course is not the only price bouncing back as the economy reopens. Some\nservices that suffered large price declines early in the pandemic, including air travel and hotel\naccommodations, saw prices jump in April, even as they remain considerably below prepandemic levels. As these sectors recover, there is certainly scope for further strong increases,\nalthough I would expect as these prices recover, the pace of increase will slow.\nA normalization of prices depressed by the pandemic doesn’t tell the whole story though.\nOther sectors have seen prices jump far above pre-pandemic levels as supply constraints have\ndeveloped against a backdrop of robust demand. This is particularly true for automobiles, where\nproduction disruptions have contributed to higher new car prices, with even larger spillovers to\nused car and rental car prices. In fact, as many recent travelers have experienced, rental car\nprices have increased more than 80 percent over the last year in the CPI data. Such bottlenecks\nseem likely to clear over time and stabilize prices.\nExpecting these price pressures to ease, however, does not ignore the potential for more\npersistent inflation pressures. Over the long-term, the outlook for inflation is influenced by\ndemand that is sufficiently strong across a wide range of goods and services that it pushes the\noverall economy up against its productive capacity. In the near-term, it can be difficult to\n4\n\n\fdistinguish between a string of seemingly idiosyncratic bottlenecks and a broader-based lack of\ncapacity. In the end, the persistence of any step up in inflation will ultimately depend on the\npricing behavior of firms and workers, which in turn will be importantly affected by expectations\nfor future inflation.\nMeasures of inflation expectations, both from surveys and financial markets, have moved\nup as the economy has reopened and strong fiscal stimulus has boosted growth. These and other\nindicators of pricing behavior will provide important signals about the longer-run trajectory for\ninflation. Prior to the pandemic, the economy had experienced a long period during which\ninflation pressures remained muted even as the economy appeared to be running near capacity.\nThe apparent lesson from this period was that the inflation process had changed relative to earlier\ndecades, a shift that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) acknowledged in the adoption\nof its new monetary policy framework last year. Although providing the context for the revised\nframework, the cause of this shift in inflation dynamics remains relatively obscure. As such, an\noverarching takeaway from this period might be that the inflation process can change, and that\nchanges can be relatively persistent.\nWhile it is clear that several temporary factors are boosting inflation now, I am not\ninclined to dismiss today’s pricing signals or to be overly reliant on historical relationships and\ndynamics in judging the outlook for inflation. The past few decades saw inflation play a\nrelatively minor role in the day-to-day decision-making of businesses and consumers.\nMaintaining this state of affairs as we seek to achieve our objectives for maximum employment\nand price stability will be important.\nThe outlook for monetary policy\nAs the pace and strength of the recovery unfolds, monetary policy settings remain highly\naccommodative and will remain so for some time in line with the FOMC’s forward guidance.\nThe Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near zero until the labor market\nhas reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and\nis on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also expects to maintain its\npurchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until substantial further progress has\nbeen made towards these employment and inflation goals.\n\n5\n\n\fJudging the appropriate timing for policy adjustments is always challenging. The\neconomy is an incredibly complex set of relationships, many of which have been disrupted by\nthe pandemic with uncertain long-term consequences. This is true for how we consume, how we\nproduce, and how we work. As the economy works its way towards a new equilibrium,\npolicymakers will be well served to take a flexible approach to monetary policy decisions, in my\nview. In this regard, the Federal Reserve’s revised framework for monetary policy, adopted last\nAugust, provides a “framework,” rather than a “rule.” The FOMC has in the past avoided strict\nadherence to monetary policy rules, so it is unsurprising that the revised framework is not a\nprecise prescription for policy action even as it repositions the Federal Reserve’s approach to\nachieving its congressional mandates for employment and inflation.\nThe structure of the economy changes over time, and it will be important to adapt to new\ncircumstances rather than adhere to a rigid formulation of policy reactions. With a tremendous\namount of fiscal stimulus flowing through the economy, the landscape could unfold quite\ndifferently than the one that shaped the thinking around the revised monetary policy framework.\nThat suggests remaining nimble and attentive to these dynamics will be important as we seek to\nachieve our policy objectives in the context of sustainable economic growth and the well-being\nof the American public.\n\n6\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nApril 13, 2021\nRacism and the Economy: Focus on the Economics Profession\nAn Online Series Hosted by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks\n\n\fHello and welcome to today’s Racism and the Economy series, presented by the 12\nregional Federal Reserve Banks. I’m Esther George, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City.\nThis landmark series focuses on inequality in our society and examines ways in which\nstructural racism manifests in our economy. Today’s event is the fifth in this series, and it is\nfocused on the economics profession. The discussion will consider racism and the pipeline into\nthe field of economics, racism and the practice of economics, and promoting inclusivity and\neffecting change.\nThe economics profession has widely acknowledged that it has a problem with diversity\nin its ranks. Last year, the American Economic Association hosted a panel titled, “How Can\nEconomics Solve Its Race Problem?” During the session, panelists cited “poor leadership,\ninstitutional dysfunctions, discouragement from specializing in the study of race, and a toxic\nprofessional culture.” 1 Such issues would be a problem in any profession, but it is a particular\nproblem in economics, where the field informs policy judgments with wide-ranging effects on\nthe American public’s well-being.\nThe Federal Reserve System is a large employer of economists in the United States and\nplays a unique role in shaping the field. Economists contribute to all aspects of our mission\nincluding monetary policy, supervision and regulation, and payments. In service to that mission,\nwe have a strong interest in shifting our workforce and the economics profession as a whole\ntowards racial inclusion. Addressing today’s economic dynamics is a complex task. It will serve\nus well to invite new perspectives and new questions about old issues to challenge dominant\nparadigms, groupthink, and blind spots. And as a public institution, the Federal Reserve’s\ncredibility depends on the expression of diversity of thought, background, and race. With so\nmuch influence over the economy and people’s day-to-day lives, the entire population must see\nthemselves reflected in the Fed.\nAs one of the regional Reserve Bank presidents, my own perspectives on race and the\neconomics profession are shaped not as a member of the economics profession but as a central\nbanker and policymaker whose views rely on input from those trained as economists. I am a\nstrong proponent of a system specifically designed to elicit a geographically diverse set of views\n1\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/01/07/793855832/economics-still-has-a-diversity-problem\n\n1\n\n\fon the state of the economy and the proper stance of monetary policy. It has been my experience\nworking within this decentralized System for nearly 40 years that policymaking is improved\nwhen diverse views are represented and assumptions are questioned. With that backdrop, I’ll\noffer a few of my own thoughts on how I view my role, as a policymaker and an employer, in\nmaking diversity a reality.\nFirst, it begins with me—not because I can solve every problem in every place, but\nwhatever I can do, I should do. I am accountable for actions within my sphere of influence, and\nfor the results in my own organization, including its culture, its hiring philosophy, and its public\nengagement.\nInclusivity must be embedded into the values of the institution, to the point of being part\nof its identity. This starts with broad policies and a statement of values, both of which are in\nplace at my Bank and throughout the Federal Reserve System. But progress requires continuous\nadvocacy and monitoring by leaders, including the use of employee surveys, exit interviews, and\ntracking and reporting metrics. Importantly, the value of inclusivity must be part of everyone’s\njob. It is how we do business.\nSecond, inclusivity must be reflected in hiring. This requires looking at the broadest\npossible applicant pool and holding leaders accountable for doing so. For example, the Federal\nReserve’s FedEconJobs.org website casts a wider net for potential applicants. As we hire, we\nmust ensure that the education and experience filters that we use are set to promote inclusivity.\nThe Fed can also play a role in encouraging students, even prior to college, that economics is a\nrelevant and attractive career path. This requires outreach and active engagement often to\novercome general misperceptions about the field that can discourage students from pursuing an\neducation in economics. My colleague at the San Francisco Fed, Mary Daly, has often pointed\nout that how we describe the profession’s aims and the scope of the questions it can help us\nanswer is key.\nFinally, when we are in a position to provide opportunities, it is essential that we pursue\ninclusivity in the allocation of those opportunities. For example, the Kansas City Fed hosts a\nnumber of conferences and events, including the annual Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson\nHole, Wyoming. As we consider the speakers and other participants for such programs, it is our\njob as the organizer to invite diversity, including bringing more women and people of color into\nthe room. Doing so actively expands the diversity of our network of contacts and improves the\n\n2\n\n\fquality of the program. This, in turn, can help expand the diversity of information we collect in\nregular economic intelligence gathering, the diversity of participants on our boards and advisory\ncouncils, and ultimately, a fuller understanding of the economy we seek to promote.\nI look forward to learning from others how to effect the change we need. It is my hope\nthat every economist and indeed every stakeholder in the economics profession will take what\nwe learn and commit to a set of actions that will make diversity in the field of economics a\nreality.\nToday’s program will consist of three panel discussions, followed by a discussion with\nthree of my Federal Reserve Bank president colleagues and closing remarks by Raphael Bostic\nof the Atlanta Fed. I’m honored to join my Federal Reserve colleagues as sponsors of this\nimportant series, as well as the other distinguished panelists for this particular topic.\nI encourage you to continue these conversations beyond today’s virtual experience.\nHundreds of today’s attendees have pledged to be a conversation leader and organize further\ndiscussions within their institutions and throughout their communities on this important topic.\nThese simple actions can bring greater awareness to issues of structural racism in America’s\neconomy, and by doing so, serve as a catalyst for change.\nWith that, I’ll turn it over to Jeanna Smialek from The New York Times, who will\nmoderate our first panel.\n\n3\n\n\f"

            "content": "An Uncertain (Though Optimistic) Outlook for an Uneven Economy\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFebruary 25, 2021\nFarm Journal Top Producer Summit\nRemarks delivered virtually\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for inviting me to participate in today’s program. I appreciate the opportunity\nto speak with you and look forward to our discussion. Agriculture is a particularly important\nsector for the region I serve. Today, I will share my observations on the agricultural economy\nalong with the national economic outlook, concluding with some thoughts on monetary policy.\nAs always, my views are wholly my own.\nThe pandemic continues to set the course for the economy, as it has for almost a year\nnow. As the pandemic unfolded and intensified last spring, contacts across our seven-state region\npainted a very bleak picture for the state of agriculture. The prices of major ag commodities fell\nsharply between February and April. A dramatic decline in travel and gasoline consumption cut\ndemand for U.S. ethanol in half, weighing on corn prices. At meatpacking plants, COVID-19\noutbreaks caused temporary closures at numerous facilities across the country, disrupting supply\nchains and putting producers in a seemingly no-win situation with animals ready to be sold. In\naddition, the closure of restaurants and food service establishments led to an unprecedented shift\nin consumer buying behavior, adding further pressure to an already-stressed food supply chain.\nAs economies around the world gradually began to reopen during the summer months,\nand supply chains began to adapt and recover, economic conditions in agriculture also began to\nimprove. Supported by robust demand from China, corn and soybean prices returned to their prepandemic level as the harvest began. Aided by substantial support from various government\nprograms, we began to hear renewed optimism in the farming community through harvest and\nheading into winter.\nBy the end of the year, businesses connected to agriculture reported a surge in sales\nactivity as crop prices rebounded to their highest mark since 2013. And, while some industries,\nparticularly livestock, remain under pressure due to drought, higher input costs and persistent\n\n1\n\n\funcertainties—to name just a few—the outlook for agriculture in large parts of the country has\nimproved dramatically. For the first time since the agricultural downturn began several years\nago, ag lenders have reported stronger loan repayments and improved liquidity with prospects for\nan increase in land values this year.\nWhile these recent improvements are encouraging, risks to the outlook remain. Many of\nthose risks and uncertainties are tied to the national economic outlook.\nA surge in the virus towards the end of last year left a noticeable impact, slowing\nconsumption and stalling the recovery in the labor market. It is encouraging that this latest wave\nof cases appears to have crested and that the pace of vaccination has accelerated. But it also\nremains clear that we are not out of the woods yet, with the risk that infections could pick up\nonce again, perhaps aided by new variants of the virus. This is just to say that the virus remains\nin the driver’s seat. Economic policy can help mitigate the economic effects of the virus, but it is\nalmost impossible to imagine a full economic recovery until the virus no longer impinges on the\nday-to-day decision making of households and businesses.\nThe continued drag of the virus is most apparent in the labor market, where we remain\nabout 10 million jobs short relative to before the pandemic. About a third of those missing jobs\nare in the high-contact leisure and hospitality sector, and are unlikely to return in strength until\nthe virus fades. While the unemployment rate has continued to edge down, falling to 6.3 percent\nin January from almost 15 percent in April last year, this number likely underestimates the\namount of slack in the labor market. In particular, the labor force participation rate remains about\n2 percentage points below its pre-pandemic level, suggesting many workers, having lost their\njobs, have dropped out of the labor force, or are at least sitting on the sidelines. This is\n\n2\n\n\fparticularly true for women, with disruptions in child care likely leading to many difficult\nchoices and lower participation in the labor market.\nThough we remain short of where we would like to be, the stage is set for a strong\nrecovery once widespread vaccination is achieved. The strength and timing of this bounce back\nis contingent in my view on three uncertain factors: first, the pace and effectiveness of\nvaccination; second, the outlook for further fiscal stimulus; and third, whether and to what\ndegree households run down the savings that they have accumulated so far through the crisis.\nStarting with the first of these factors, once the virus is suppressed, I expect a strong\nrebound in demand for many of the most afflicted sectors, including travel, live entertainment,\nand of particular importance to the agricultural sector, restaurants. In addition, the normalization\nof child care arrangements could allow for the quick return of some currently sidelined workers.\nThe faster and more effective the vaccination program, the greater the prospects for a faster and\nstronger economic recovery.\nTurning to the second factor, fiscal support has been essential for maintaining economic\nactivity through the pandemic. The Paycheck Protection Program has provided significant\nsupport to small businesses, allowing many to avoid the cost and disruption of bankruptcy or\nclosure. Transfer payments to households and enhanced unemployment benefits have supported\nconsumer spending, especially at businesses relatively insulated from the direct effects of the\npandemic. With the economy still in the grip of the pandemic, previously enacted fiscal measures\ncontinue to play an important role in supporting growth. Further fiscal stimulus, as is currently\nbeing discussed, would undoubtedly accelerate growth. However, by exactly how much is\nuncertain. The package being discussed is heavily weighted towards transfer payments, to\n\n3\n\n\fhouseholds and state and local governments. Similar to the previous rounds of fiscal support, a\nsubstantial portion of these transfers could be saved rather than spent immediately.\nWhich brings me to the third factor likely to determine the speed and strength of the\nrecovery: how households, in the aggregate, treat the excess saving that they have accumulated\nduring the pandemic. Partly as a consequence of restrictions on activity, but mostly on account of\nlarge fiscal transfers, the personal saving rate shot up to a record high in the second quarter.\nThough it has since fallen back, the saving rate remains about twice as high as it was prior to the\npandemic. All told, it has been estimated that over the past year households have increased their\nsavings (or paid down their debt) by about $1.5 trillion relative to normal levels. A consequence\nof this accumulation makes aggregate household balance sheets look stronger, even as it masks\nthat many individual households find themselves in a difficult financial position.\nThis improvement in household finances, which is atypical coming out of a recession,\nputs households in a strong position to resume spending once the pandemic is in the rearview\nmirror. This is especially true if the run up in saving reflected an inability to consume due to\npandemic-related restrictions. However, given the shock that the pandemic has delivered to the\neconomy and households, there is some uncertainty as to how quickly or forcefully households\nwill want to run off their saving buffer or resume accumulating debt. If households remain\nrelatively cautious given a new understanding of possible health and economic risks, the\nrecovery will be slower and lengthier.\nGiven the uncertainties around the outlook, monetary policy remains highly\naccommodative, and is set to remain so for some time in line with the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) forward guidance. The Committee has stated that it expects to keep the\npolicy rate near zero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with maximum\n\n4\n\n\femployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent\nfor some time. The FOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgagebacked securities until substantial further progress has been made towards these employment and\ninflation goals.\nBased on this guidance, the FOMC is positioned to be patient as it follows the outlook for\nthe virus and the economy. Certainly, it is too early to discuss pulling back on accommodation\ngiven continue elevated unemployment, below-target inflation, and the uncertainties surrounding\nthe outlook. Likewise, the notable recent rise in longer-term interest rates does not in my view\nwarrant a monetary policy response for several reasons.\nFirst, most of the rise in the ten-year Treasury this year appears to reflect an increase in\nthe real yield, that is the interest rate controlling for inflation compensation. Much of this\nincrease likely reflects growing optimism in the strength of the recovery and could be viewed as\nan encouraging sign of increasing growth expectations. If this is indeed the reason that yields are\nincreasing, they are unlikely to rise to the point of smothering the optimism that led to their\nincrease in the first place, and measures of real yields remain deeply negative and only a touch\noff all-time lows.\nSecond, any additional stimulus could exacerbate the unevenness that has been the\ndefining characteristic of the pandemic downturn. Already, although appropriate, it seems likely\nthat easing of monetary policy over the last year has contributed to the observed unevenness. In\nparticular, interest-sensitive sectors, including housing and durable goods consumption have\ndone quite well during the pandemic, supported by accommodative monetary policy, with many\nof these sectors reporting record years. Less interest-sensitive sectors, including many services,\n\n5\n\n\fhave benefited less, at least directly, from accommodative monetary policy while also suffering\nthe worst of virus-related disruptions.\nIt is unusual for a recession to affect services more adversely than goods-producing\nsectors. In most recessions, interest-sensitive sectors, such as durable goods consumption, are\ngenerally hit harder than non-interest sensitive sectors, such as services, and accommodative\nmonetary policy—by lowering interest rates—works to buffer the unevenness of a typical\nrecession. Given the unique nature of the pandemic shock, things are different this time. The\nshock has hit services spending harder than goods spending, and lower interest rates have likely\ncontributed to unevenness rather than buffered it. In this situation, further monetary stimulus\nseems unlikely to help close gaps in the most virus-afflicted sectors while simultaneously\nrunning the risk of exacerbating imbalances and shortages in interest-sensitive sectors.\nA third reason for patience on the part of policymakers, in my view, is the likelihood of a\nstrong bounce back in activity as vaccination proceeds. Monetary policy tends to influence the\neconomy with a meaningful lag, and therefore further monetary stimulus at this point could\neasily be mistimed.\nWith a patient stance of accommodative monetary policy, the prospect of a strong\nrebound in activity, and signals of higher inflation compensation in the ten-year Treasury yield,\nthere has been considerable speculation about the risk of higher future inflation. Right now, the\ninflation picture is a muddled one.\nLast August, the Federal Reserve announced a revised framework for the conduct of\nmonetary policy. One motivation for the revised framework was a desire to firm up inflation\nexpectations at a level consistent with the Fed’s 2 percent inflation objective. In this regard, the\nCommittee announced that the Fed would seek inflation that averages 2 percent over time, such\n\n6\n\n\fthat periods of inflation persistently below 2 percent would be followed by periods of inflation\nmoderately above 2 percent. By shoring up inflation expectations, the Fed hopes to limit further\nslippage in nominal interest rates and decrease the risk of interest rates hitting zero and\nconstraining monetary policy. In this regard, the recent increase in inflation compensation is a\npromising signal that markets take seriously the Fed’s commitment to stabilize inflation\nexpectations near its 2 percent objective.\nCurrently aggregate PCE inflation remains a bit short of that objective, running at 1.3\npercent over the year ending in December, as the pandemic has hit some prices particularly hard,\nincluding airfares and hotel accommodation. Notwithstanding muted inflation in the aggregate,\nthe components of this measure reveal a particularly muddled inflation picture. While some\nprices are down, other sectors, particularly durable goods, are recording their fastest price\nincreases in decades. In fact, by some measures, the dispersion in inflation across sectors has\nnever been greater, a further indication of the current uneven economy. 1\nOne consequence of such wide dispersion is that any measure of overall inflation\nbecomes less meaningful. Overall inflation is constructed by averaging inflation across\nindividual sectors weighted by their importance in aggregate consumption. While we would like\nfor overall inflation to reveal the trend in prices across the entire economy, a wide dispersion in\ninflation across individual sectors makes overall inflation less informative for that trend. As an\nexample of this, with very disparate inflation it is likely that individual households are currently\nexperiencing very different inflation rates dependent on the distinct set of goods and services that\nthey consume. Certainly some households might be surprised to hear that overall inflation is\n\nFor example, the product of the fraction of expenditures experiencing two-standard deviation declines in inflation\nand the fraction of expenditures experiencing two-standard deviation increases in inflation reached a record high in\nNovember.\n\n1\n\n7\n\n\fsubdued given the particular basket of goods and services that they are consuming. More\ngenerally, it is also worth recognizing that overall inflation could firm up quickly postvaccination as demand for hard-hit sectors recovers.\nMonitoring these price signals and progress on employment will remain essential even as\nthe FOMC takes a patient approach to monetary policy. Once the fog of the uncertainties\ncurrently obscuring the outlook clears, those policy settings will necessarily be reconsidered.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "Real Estate: A Vital Sector Poised for Change\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFebruary 16, 2021\nUniversity of Missouri-Kansas City Real Estate Symposium\nKansas City, Mo.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fI appreciate the opportunity to participate in this year’s UMKC real estate forum, and I\nlook forward to our discussion. The real estate sector is a vital part of our economy. For a\npolicymaker, following developments in real estate is essential. As of year-end 2019, it\naccounted for a quarter of household assets and 40 percent of business assets. The construction\nindustry alone employs more than 5 percent of the nation’s workforce, and housing is the\nsecond-largest component of personal consumption, topped only by healthcare. As such,\nfluctuations in the value of real estate can affect household consumption, business activity and\nthe health and stability of our financial system.\nThe pandemic has disrupted all aspects of the economy, including real estate. The sharp\ndrop in activity last spring, as consumers pulled back and restrictions impeded business,\ncoincided with a jump in the unemployment rate from 50-year lows to levels not seen since the\nGreat Depression. Since then, the economy has bounced back, supported by a tremendous\namount of fiscal support and very accommodative monetary policy. But the recovery so far has\nbeen both incomplete and uneven, as close to 10 million jobs have yet to return, and some\nsectors struggle even as others have reported record years. As I will discuss, this unevenness has\nalso been apparent within real estate, as the residential sector has boomed even as non-residential\nhas lagged.\nAs vaccination progresses and the virus is brought under control, we could see a further\nrobust recovery in economic activity, likely by the second half of this year. That said, even as we\nrecover, it seems clear that we are not going back to where we started. The pandemic will likely\nresult in, or at least accelerate, structural changes in the economy, and, as you are well aware,\nreal estate seems poised to be on the forefront of these changes.\n\n1\n\n\fIn my remarks today, I will review how real estate markets have weathered the pandemic\nso far. I’ll also note some of the long-term structural challenges confronting the sector, closing\nwith a review of the implications for real estate finance and the health and stability of the\nfinancial system more generally. As always, all of my views are wholly my own.\n\nNear-term developments\nAs discussed earlier, one of the defining features of our current economy is its\nunevenness, a feature that carries over to the real estate sector. On the positive side, single-family\nhousing is booming. Existing sales, prices, and starts all rose sharply during the second half of\n2020 and look poised to remain strong for some time. In the Kansas City metropolitan area,\npermits for new single-family homes in the fourth quarter of 2020 were up by 33 percent from\none year earlier, somewhat higher than national increase of 25 percent. Housing has been\nsupported by record-low mortgage rates and an apparent increased demand for living space, as\nhouseholds adjust to pandemic restrictions and many people work from home.\nFor multifamily housing, the picture is more mixed. Compared to a year earlier, rents in\nthe fourth quarter were down sharply in the center of many large metropolitan areas, pulling\ndown average apartment rents by about 4 percent on a national basis. But in many medium and\nsmaller metropolitan areas, especially in suburban locations, rents have held firm and even\nincreased. In the Kansas City metropolitan area, apartment rents have fallen modestly in the city\nproper but have increased in almost all suburban markets. Vacancies have varied similarly: up\nconsiderably in the center of many large metropolitan areas but holding firm and even declining\nelsewhere. However, vacancy rates may be misleadingly low, held down by the eviction\n\n2\n\n\fmoratorium. The Census Bureau estimates that more than one in six renters—more than three\ntimes the typical rate—were behind on rent at the end of January. 1\nConditions for non-residential real estate have varied as well. Despite an uptick in\nvacancies, office rents were about unchanged over the year. More concerning, however, are hotel\nand retail properties. Tenants in these sectors have experienced declining demand as the\npandemic led to a sharp drop in travel, reduced dining out, and a large shift in shopping from inperson to online. As a result, hotel occupancy has dropped and retail vacancies have jumped,\npushing rents down.\n\nThe longer-term real outlook\nLooking further out, I think it is likely that the pandemic will cause, or at least hasten,\nsome significant structural changes in real estate. One development that has attracted\nconsiderable attention is the rise of remote work. Many companies have discovered that they can\nperform well, with employees remaining highly productive, in a remote stance. As a result, a\nmajority of surveyed executives expressed a willingness to allow their office employees to work\nremotely some of the time once the health crisis has passed. 2 However, most executives who\nfavor the option to work remotely also stress the importance of regularly working on-site in order\nto foster collaboration and to build company culture. Most surveyed office employees also\nexpressed a desire to work remotely some of the time after the virus fades as a concern, with a\nsizeable minority saying they would like to do so all of the time. 3\n\nParrott, Jim and Mark Zandi. 2021. “Averting an Eviction Crisis.” Moody’s Analytics.\nPwC. 2021. “It’s Time to Reimagine Where and How Work Will Get Done: PwC’s U.S. Remote Work Survey,\nJanuary 12, 2021.” PwC, January 12.\n3\nPwC. 2021. “It’s Time to Reimagine Where and How Work Will Get Done: PwC’s U.S. Remote Work Survey,\nJanuary 12, 2021.” PwC, January 12.\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n\fIn addition to affecting the overall demand for office space, it seems likely that an\nincrease in remote working could significantly affect the geography of economic activity.\nAssuming that employers and employees coalesce to a hybrid model, the most meaningful\nimpact of a rise in remote work could be a reduction in commuting time, which could affect\nwhere workers want to live and where businesses decide to locate. Estimates suggest that if\nemployees in occupations amenable to remote working on average worked from home two days\nper week, the decline in daily commuting volume would cut one-way travel time on many\nhighway segments by 20 percent or more. 4 Saved time would likely be greatest in large\nmetropolitan areas, where traffic congestion has been worst and travel times highest.\nLess frequent commutes and faster speeds would likely make many workers willing to\nlive further away from their place of employment, and could increase the desirability of living in\nthe outlying suburbs of metropolitan areas, where large tracts of lightly-settled land are available\nfor development. The current boom in single-family construction likely rests in part on this\nincreased willingness to live farther from work, with households anticipating increased remote\nworking following the end of the pandemic.\nTurning to the location of workplaces, less frequent commutes and faster speeds may lead\nsome companies to shift their offices from suburban locations to central ones. In particular, less\ncommuting would diminish some of the current advantages of suburban offices. Fewer\ncommutes lessen the advantage of locating closer to residential neighborhoods. Fewer workers\ncoming in on any given day also lessens the advantage of plentiful parking at suburban\nworkplaces.\n\nRappaport, Jordan. 2021. “Hybrid Officing Will Shift Where People and Businesses Decide to Locate.” Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, Economic Bulletin, February 3.\n4\n\n4\n\n\fThe cost advantage of suburban compared to downtown offices may also diminish. To\nthe extent that an individual company cuts back on leased office space, rent would become a\nsmaller share of its total business expenses. Moreover, as many companies cut back on leased\noffice space, the corresponding decrease in total demand would put downward pressure on office\nrents regardless of location, also cutting down on rent as a share of total business expenses. The\ndecrease in office rents as a share of business expenses lessens the incentive to avoid locations\nwith premium rents, such as downtowns.\nOf course, we are in the early stages of seeing how these trends play out, and much\nremains uncertain. However, from a broader perspective any significant change in the location of\neconomic activity, regardless of its specific form, has the potential to significantly affect the\nvaluations of residential and commercial real estate. These revaluations, in turn, have important\nfinancial stability implications, to which I turn next.\n\nImplication for financial stability\nOver the past several decades we have learned that the financial stability implications of\nreal estate can hardly be understated. Most recently, many accounts trace the roots of the 2008\nfinancial crisis to excesses in residential real estate financing. In addition, the lessons from\ndisruptions to commercial real estate financing in the aftermath of the financial crisis are equally\nimportant today. While the strains on real estate finance currently appear contained, this relative\nhealth has been importantly supported by the extraordinary policy response to the pandemic. If\nsupport fades ahead of a sustained recovery, stresses could become more prominent, especially\nagainst a backdrop of disruptive structural change.\n\n5\n\n\fGoing into the pandemic, the residential market was in a much better place than it had\nbeen prior to the financial crisis, in part due to regulatory changes adopted after that crisis.\nStrengthened underwriting standards contributed to a decline in the share of non-prime mortgage\nbalances and, overall, households had been deleveraging for most of the last decade. As a result,\nthe U.S. household debt service ratio—debt service payments as a share of personal disposable\nincome—had declined considerably. At the same time, household net-worth increased, driven\nlargely by stock market and real estate gains. The way housing is financed has also changed,\nwith non-banks increasing origination share, while the largest banks and private label\nsecuritization pulled back.\nThe onset of COVID-19 led to an immediate slowdown in origination activity as the\npandemic temporarily dampened real estate showings, interior appraisals, and in-person closings.\nHowever, a sharp decline in mortgage rates, following the Fed’s forceful monetary policy\nresponse to the pandemic, has helped revive the market, increasing demand for both purchases\nand refinancing.\nWhile origination activity has bounced back to record levels, other parts of the residential\nmortgage market may require careful monitoring. In particular, delinquencies remain low due to\nthe extraordinary policy measures undertaken during the pandemic. For example, the CARES\nAct passed last spring included temporary payment forbearance on federally backed mortgages.\nThe share of mortgages in forbearance peaked at 8.8 percent in June 2020 but has since\nmoderated to 5.2 percent in January 2021; the unpaid principal balance on these mortgages is\nestimated to be $548 billion. 5 The uptake in forbearance temporarily reduces transition rates into\ndelinquency but creates the potential for a future wave of foreclosures when borrowers exit\nBased on observations using Black Knight’s McDash Flash data. Monthly reports available at\nhttps://www.blackknightinc.com/data-reports/\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\fforbearance. Currently, mortgage debt levels relative to home valuations are not elevated and the\nestimated share of households with negative equity is low. These considerations not only dampen\ndefault rates but also reduce losses for lenders if borrowers were to default, thereby lowering\nrisks of spillovers to broader financial markets.\nThe pandemic has also highlighted vulnerabilities associated with non-depository\nmortgage companies—in short, nonbanks that originate and service mortgages. As I mentioned\nearlier, nonbanks have more than doubled their market share over the previous decade and\ncurrently originate over 60 percent of new mortgages. Nonbanks typically rely on short-term\nfunding and are subject to making servicing advances on delinquent borrowers. Therefore,\nsignificant increases in nonpayment can impose capital and liquidity strains for these nonbanks,\nwhich happened in the early days of the pandemic. Measures enacted by federal agencies to\nlessen the burden of advances on loan forbearances and a quick policy-aided rebound in\norigination activity helped relieve the strains on nonbanks. Nevertheless, the viability of nonbank\nmortgage originators and servicers is critical for providing mortgage credit access, especially in\nunderserved communities where nonbanks have a significant presence.\nStrains in the commercial real estate market could also pose significant threats to\nfinancial stability. Past experience shows that severe downturns in the commercial property\nmarket can destabilize the banking system, and regulators have taken numerous steps to address\nthese risks. In particular, commercial real estate concentrations at smaller banks declined below\nthe levels seen prior to the 2008 financial crisis and capital levels increased significantly. Still,\nbalance sheet holdings have increased the past few years with commercial real estate loans\nmaking up more than one-quarter of all assets held at smaller community banks at the end of\n2019.\n\n7\n\n\fTo date, however, credit performance has held up reasonably well. So far, delinquency\nrates on bank loans secured by commercial properties have recorded modest increases and are\nsignificantly lower than what was anticipated by bankers, regulators and market analysts in the\nearly days of the pandemic. Both direct and indirect measures have helped to support the flow of\ncredit. For example, direct measures such as regulatory encouragement for banks to work\nconstructively with borrowers and the expansion of the Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility (TALF\n2020) to include certain commercial mortgage backed-securities (CMBS) provided support for\nportfolio and securitized commercial real estate lending.\nAdditionally, the extraordinary measures taken by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury\nhelped both lenders and borrowers in this market. On the borrower side, enhanced\nunemployment insurance as well as funds made available to businesses through the Main Street\nLending facility and the Paycheck Protection Program aided commercial property tenants to keep\nrental payments flowing. On the lender side, these extraordinary measures provided capital and\nliquidity support to banks and other lenders to help them voluntarily offer forbearance to\ndistressed borrowers and to supply additional credit to this market. As such, forbearance has\nbeen a significant contributor to improved metrics of CRE loan performance. Still, market\nanalysts predict that a significant volume of commercial loans currently in modification\nprograms may ultimately default. 6\nGiven this backdrop, a worrying scenario is that the economic impact of the pandemic\noutlasts the policy support programs currently in place. Should that occur, many renters and\nbusinesses could find themselves unable to meet their obligations, forcing banks to realize losses\non existing loans and weighing on credit growth and broader economic activity.\nStovall, Nathan. 2021, “Deferrals plunge, credit migration minimal heading into ominous winter.” S&P Global\nMarket Intelligence, Research & Analysis. January 5.\n6\n\n8\n\n\fConclusion\nDevelopments in real estate have important implications for the broad economic\nrecovery, both in terms of growth and employment, as well as for financial stability. Just as with\nthe aggregate economy, the effect of the pandemic on real estate has been uneven as the boom in\nsingle-family residential housing has been accompanied by higher vacancy rates in most\nsegments of commercial real estate. While it is important to acknowledge the role of policy in\nsupporting the real estate market, it is also important to be aware of the forthcoming challenges\nwhen this support is withdrawn, especially against the backdrop of longer-term structural\nchanges to the outlook.\n\n9\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJanuary 12, 2021\nCentral Exchange\nKansas City, Mo.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for inviting me to participate in your event today. I appreciate the opportunity\nto speak with you about my outlook for the nation’s economy and look forward to our\ndiscussion. As we turn the calendar to a new year, the opportunity to reflect on the past and to\nlook ahead to the future is a time-honored tradition. Today I will do a little of both.\nLast year was one for the record books. The year had both the largest decline in quarterly\nGDP on record as well as the largest increase. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low before\nclimbing to levels not seen since the Great Depression. The equity market set record highs, while\nthe price of oil dropped below zero for the first time ever, if only for a moment. The year saw the\nlargest fiscal policy reaction and the most rapid increase in government debt, even as the yield on\ngovernment securities fell to new lows. The Federal Reserve, for its part, broke new ground in\npolicy accommodation, while expanding its balance sheet to record size. Suffice to say, 2020\nwas not a typical year.\nI am hopeful, as I believe many of us are, that 2021 will mark the beginning of a return to\nsomething more like normal. Just two weeks in, we are off to a rocky start. However, I am\ngenerally optimistic that the year will be one of continued economic recovery, though not\nwithout bumps and potholes, particularly in the first part of the year as the virus continues to\nexact a terrible human and economic toll.\nIn my remarks today, I will offer my outlook for the economy, noting my growing\nconfidence in the recovery, notwithstanding near-term turbulence. Underlying this outlook are\nmy expectations about a path to resolving the pandemic, renewed fiscal support and the\ncontinued accommodative stance of monetary policy. Even as the economy recovers, the events\nof the last year are likely to leave an imprint on the economic outlook for years to come. There is\nno going back to where we started, and I’ll highlight my own thoughts on some of the longer-\n\n1\n\n\fterm consequences of the pandemic. Finally, I will turn to what this all means for the path of\nmonetary policy.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nStarting with the outlook, economic activity appears to have stalled at the end of last\nyear. Consumer spending edged down broadly, not just in the contact-intensive service sectors\nmost sensitive to the path of the virus, but also for durable goods, which have been quite strong\nup to now. The widespread nature of this pullback suggests that fading fiscal support along with\nuncertainty about the timing of any new government transfers likely weighed on activity, as did\nthe resurgence of the virus across the country.\nWith the virus still impeding the resumption of many activities, employment growth also\nhas stalled, with the economy shedding 140,000 jobs in December. Given that we ended the year\nstill 10 million jobs short relative to before the pandemic, there remains quite a large gap to\nclose. About a third of the jobs that have yet to come back are in the high-contact leisure and\nhospitality industry, making it likely that the pace of employment growth will remain lackluster\nuntil widespread vaccination is achieved and the virus diminishes as an everyday concern.\nOverall, much of the optimism for eventual recovery this year is tied to a successful and\nwidespread vaccination program. One of the most substantial risks to the outlook is a significant\ndelay or disruption in the administration of the vaccine. Already, a slower-than-expected roll out\nhas led many analysts to push back their estimates for when the United States might achieve\nbroad-based immunity. It is difficult to imagine a sustained and robust recovery until the virus no\nlonger interferes with the public’s day-to-day decision-making.\n\n2\n\n\fThat said, there is reason to be optimistic about the economy’s growth prospects postvaccination. One signal has come from equity markets, which have responded favorably to\npositive vaccine news. Sectors that have been particularly hard hit by the virus, including air\ntravel and leisure and hospitality, have seen some of the largest price gains, suggesting that\ninvestors, at least, are optimistic that demand could bounce back strongly for these stilldepressed services. Inventories are another dynamic that could support strong growth later this\nyear. Businesses, and particularly retail establishments, ran down their inventories during the\nearly stages of the pandemic, unsure of future sales prospects. A sustained recovery in demand\ncould prompt businesses to restock, boosting production and growth, even if perhaps also\nstraining some supply chains.\nThe additional fiscal support passed at the end of last year also sets the stage for a strong\nrecovery. A renewed Paycheck Protection Program offers the prospect of sustaining small\nbusinesses until demand picks up, avoiding the significant cost and disruption of bankruptcy or\nclosure. Transfer payments in the CARES Act had boosted aggregate personal income to an alltime high in the spring, even as wage income fell off steeply, providing a key support to\nconsumption and the economy. In recent months, personal income had been trending down, as\nthe payments faded and wage income has yet to fully recover. The new fiscal package, with\nenhanced unemployment benefits and household stimulus payments, should once again push up\npersonal income, maintaining support for spending and growth.\nAs with the earlier government transfers, there is a high likelihood that a large portion of\nthe renewed fiscal support will end up being saved by households rather than spent. In April, the\npersonal saving rate shot up to a record 34 percent, as transfer payments boosted income and\nCovid restrictions and concerns limited consumption. Although the saving rate has come down\n\n3\n\n\fsince, it remains almost twice as high as the average prior to the pandemic. Of course, fiscal\nsupport that is saved has less of an immediate impact on growth than that which is spent, but it\nalso is true that transfers that strengthen household balance sheets can prevent a pullback in\nspending that might otherwise occur as households demand higher precautionary buffers in an\nuncertain environment. Also, once concern for the virus ebbs, relatively healthy household\nbalance sheets should allow for a quick rebound in demand and a resumption of activity. To the\nextent such dynamics prevail, the economy might avoid the experience of the Global Financial\nCrisis, when even after the recession ended there was a prolonged period of household\ndeleveraging that contributed to a lackluster pace of growth for years.\n\nLong-Term Implications of the Pandemic\nWhen thinking about the long-term consequences of 2020, I find it helpful to group the\npotential factors into three broad categories. First, despite the best efforts of policymakers, there\nare likely to be scars from the crisis that will take time to heal. Businesses and workers have\nsuffered a tremendous disruption, and while there is some optimism for a quick bounce-back, it\nwould not be unexpected for some of the negative effects to persist. Second, the crisis will leave\na lasting impact on business and public sector balance sheets, with governments taking on\nnotably more debt, central bank balance sheets swelling around the world, and corporate\nborrowing soaring, even as household balance sheets, in the aggregate, have improved. Third, the\ncrisis will likely have a lasting effect on the structure of the economy, both by changing the way\nthat people work as well as what and how they consume.\nStarting with the first of these three broad categories, there could be economic scarring\nthat eventually heals, but only after some time. For example, as mentioned earlier, 10 million\n\n4\n\n\ffewer individuals are working now relative to before the pandemic. Given the notable decline in\nlabor force participation over the same period, it would appear that about half of those workers\nthat lost jobs dropped out of the labor force altogether. Traditionally, it has taken some time to\nbring individuals back into the labor force, and it has often taken a fairly hot labor market to do\nso.\nAn additional dynamic with this crisis has been the disproportionate decline in labor\nforce participation among woman. In particular, about half of the decline in women’s\nparticipation is attributable to caregiving, likely reflecting disruptions in child care. While this\ncould suggest a quicker bounce-back once the virus is checked and normal child care options\nreturn, it is important to note that even after returning to the job, these workers could suffer\ninterruptions in human capital development and career progression, with unfortunate long-term\neffects.\nTurning to the second broad category, 2020 has scrambled balance sheets across the\neconomy. While household balance sheets are generally in good shape, this has come at the\nexpense of government finances. The federal government increased its liabilities to fund\ntransfers that, in many cases, have turned into household assets. Again, it must be noted that the\nrelative strength of household balance sheets is in the aggregate. Certainly, the pandemic has led\nto significant economic hardship for many, as a large number of households struggle to pay bills\nand purchase necessities. One of the defining features of the pandemic has been the unevenness\nof its economic impact. There has been substantial variation in how different industries,\nprofessions and geographies have been affected, with some sectors reporting record activity even\nas others have seen demand collapse.\n\n5\n\n\fOn the business side, non-financial corporations have further increased borrowing from\nalready elevated levels, in part to cover pandemic-related holes in revenue but also, for larger\ncorporations, to take advantage of near-zero interest rates and favorable borrowing conditions.\nThese shifts in balance sheets can have long-run impacts. For example, the large increase in\ngovernment debt could limit a fiscal policy response during some future crisis. Higher levels of\nbusiness debt could threaten financial stability, increasing the fragility of the financial system to\nprospective shocks.\nFinally, looking at the third broad category, the pandemic has likely unleashed, or at least\naccelerated, structural and technological changes that will continue to play out over years or even\ndecades. These include a shift to remote work, as well as online retail and entertainment. While\nthese changes could ultimately result in increased economic productivity, there will likely be\nnear- and medium-term disruptions as resources shift between sectors. These changes also\nincrease the risks around the value of capital in certain sectors—for example, commercial and\nretail real estate—which could in turn raise important financial stability considerations.\n\nMonetary Policy\nAn exceptionally uncertain economic outlook, with the chance of both downside and\nupside surprises, creates a complicated and difficult environment for monetary policy. While the\nvaccine promises an eventual end to the virus’s hold on the economy, there remains a substantial\ngap to be bridged before we get there. With the most recent fiscal package, the economy could\nget the necessary momentum to bridge this gap and prevent standard recessionary dynamics from\ntaking hold before we reach the safety of widespread vaccination.\n\n6\n\n\fMonetary policy is also playing an important role in supporting the economy, as it has\nsince the start of the pandemic. In March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut its\npolicy interest rate to near zero and launched an aggressive balance sheet expansion program,\npurchasing large quantities of Treasuries and Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). While these\npurchases were initially directed towards smoothing market functioning, the expansion of the\nFed’s balance sheet also supports accommodative financial conditions, to the benefit of the\noverall economy. In September, the FOMC provided forward guidance, consistent with the Fed’s\nnew monetary policy framework, that interest rates would remain near zero until the labor\nmarket reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation had both risen to 2\npercent and was on track to exceed 2 percent for some time. In December, the Committee further\nextended its forward guidance to cover its asset purchases, stating that it will continue to increase\nits holding of Treasuries and MBS by at least the current pace until substantial further progress\nhas been made on its employment and inflation goals. Overall, the outlook is for monetary policy\nto remain accommodative for some time.\nClearly, in the current environment where the economy continues to heal, an\naccommodative policy stance is appropriate. It is too soon to speculate about the timing of any\nchange in this stance. The Committee has agreed that further substantial progress in achieving\nhigh employment and average inflation at its 2 percent target is necessary before making\nadjustments. This wait-and-see approach will guide the trajectory of monetary policy. As the\ndata come in, and the economy evolves, the public and markets should be able to adjust their\nexpectations regarding the policy path. This feature of forward guidance is especially useful now\ngiven the heightened uncertainty around the outlook, stemming in large part from the path of the\n\n7\n\n\fvirus. In the near-term, the risks are predominately negative, but once the pandemic is behind us,\nthere is considerable scope for a snapback in activity.\nHowever, as the economy recovers and the Committee judges progress toward its\nmandate for employment and inflation, policymakers will necessarily wrestle with judgments\nabout the appropriate stance of its policy settings. With longer-term implications of the pandemic\nnoted earlier unfolding over time, these deliberations are likely to be challenging. For example,\nhow long-lasting will the effects of the pandemic on the labor market be? Should we expect\nemployment to return to its lows of early 2020? Or will changes in the structure of the economy\nand labor markets shift employment’s long-run equilibrium?\nWill inflation continue to fall short of central bankers’ desired 2 percent long-run\naverage, or will other dynamics take hold and shift inflation impulses? For example, although\naggregate inflation, as measured by the PCE index, remains muted, a few hard-hit services prices\nhave played a disproportionate role in depressing the aggregate index. To the extent that a postvaccine bounce-back boosts demand and prices in these sectors, including airfares and hotel\naccommodation, inflation could move up quickly. Other large contributors to the decline in\ninflation are a bit idiosyncratic, including owner-occupied housing and financial services. In\ncontrast to these sectors, price inflation for many other categories of consumption (particularly\ngoods) has moved up, sometimes quite sharply. Such a scenario does not suggest higher inflation\nis a near-term threat, but rather that inflation could approach the Committee’s average inflation\nobjective more quickly than some might expect.\nFinally, will highly accommodative monetary policy seed imbalances in the economy that\nincrease the fragility of the economy to the next inevitable shock? Will other mechanisms\neffectively mitigate and balance any destabilizing elements of a low-for-long rate environment?\n\n8\n\n\fAs we close the chapter on 2020, the New Year ushers in its own mix of optimism and\nchallenges. The experience of the pandemic will undoubtedly leave its mark even as our nation’s\neconomy shows its resilience and recovers. Ultimately, the wisdom to understand this unfolding\nlandscape and to respond with appropriate policy adjustments will set the course for achieving\nour objectives for financial stability, sustainable long-run growth, employment and inflation.\n\n9\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nDecember 11, 2020\nDelivered during panel discussion on “Transparency in Bank Supervision”\nat “Bank Supervision: Past, Present and Future,” an online conference hosted by\nThe Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Harvard University and\nthe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fI appreciate the opportunity to share my views and take part in this discussion. Having\nspent a significant portion of my Fed career associated with the business of bank supervision, I\napproach this topic from the perspective of a practitioner.\nI joined the Kansas City Fed in 1982 as a bank examiner. Since then, I’ve observed\nhundreds of banks fail across the country for a variety of reasons. Yet, I can’t recall a single one\nsuccumbing to that fate that was well capitalized, well managed, and well supervised. Of course,\nconsiderable research has been devoted to the issue of bank capital and the dynamics of\ngovernance. Considerably less scholarship has focused on what it means to be “well supervised,”\nand so I look forward to the deliberations of this conference in advancing our thinking on that\ndimension.\nMore than two decades ago, the Federal Reserve released a study on improving public\ndisclosure in banking. 1 The report focused on market discipline and transparency as a response\nto a changing banking landscape. The evolution of the financial system had contributed to\ngrowing complexity in financial instruments and services, as well as increasing the scale and\nscope of the nation’s largest banks. At that time, market discipline was viewed as a preferred\nalternative to large-scale expansion of supervision and regulation as a means of limiting\nexcessive risk-taking by large, complex financial institutions. Proposed changes focused on\nregulatory reporting and a wider scope of disclosures by large banks.\nImproving public access to information on banking organizations could have many\nbenefits, including enhancing market discipline, promoting effective management, and enforcing\nsupervisory accountability. However, the public benefits of transparency must necessarily be\n\nFederal Reserve System. 2000. \"Improving Public Disclosure in Banking (Staff Study 172).\" Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System. March.\n1\n\n1\n\n\fbalanced with the need for confidentiality. This does not mean that more transparency guarantees\ngreater stability or that there are rigid disclosure standards that can be easily applied across all\ncircumstances. Recalibrating the existing boundaries of CSI must be approached through the lens\nof the public’s interest in a fair, stable and sound financial system. Importantly, the value of\ntransparency is not in the volume of information disclosed, but rather in the clarity it provides in\npromoting responsible, effective management of the supervised entities.\nTo that end, several questions are worth considering. How do the traditional protections\nafforded to CSI and other supervisory practices contribute to financial stability? Are there ways\nin which greater transparency might strengthen both risk management and supervisory\naccountability? Do the answers to these two questions change during times of crisis or systemic\nstress? Should there be some additional consideration based on the institution’s size, risk profile\nor systemic importance?\nBefore continuing, I will remind you that my views are wholly my own.\n\nWhat’s the Big Secret?\nBroadly speaking, the rationale for CSI is a sound one in my view. Two reasons are\ncommonly given as the foundation for protecting CSI: 2\n•\n\nFirst, some degree of confidentiality is desirable to ensure the security of financial\ninstitutions and to protect against unintended and adverse effects that might result\nfrom the disclosure of certain types of sensitive supervisory information. This\ncould include customer data, proprietary market intelligence, or even candid\n\nDepartment of Justice. 2020. \"Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act.\" United States\nDepartment of Justice.\n2\n\n2\n\n\fsupervisory assessments, such as control weaknesses in critical operating\ninfrastructure, the public exposure of which might compromise banks’ safety.\n•\n\nSecond, confidentiality can help foster a relationship of trust between supervisors\nand the institutions, enabling frank dialogue and creating an environment in which\nbank management may be more likely to cooperate with examiners.\n\nIn my experience, both of these are desirable features of effective supervision.\nSupervisors’ detailed access to bank activities and their analysis of proprietary and internal\ninformation place them in a unique position to assess risk exposures that may not be available\nfrom other independent sources.\n\nWhere Might More Disclosure Add Value?\nMight we foster a more stable financial system through greater transparency and market\ndiscipline, and if so, how? I believe the answer is a qualified yes. Greater disclosure can create\nincentives for more responsible risk management and contribute to a strong and trusted banking\nsystem. There are of course trade-offs, and we should carefully consider how much detail is\nnecessary to promote the outcomes we seek.\nWhen considering transparency, drawing distinctions between institutions based on their\nsize, complexity and risk profile should be a consideration. For example, during the financial\ncrisis, stress testing the nation’s largest banks was introduced as a way to enhance public\nconfidence in the nation’s financial system. The announcement of the Supervisory Capital\nAssessment Program (SCAP) results in 2009 provided information to the public regarding the\nscale of potential losses that the largest banks might incur if the economy were to continue to\n\n3\n\n\fdeteriorate. 3 Continued disclosure of firm-specific information regarding capital adequacy\nthrough the annual CCAR and DFAST exercises has been viewed as valuable in supporting\npublic confidence in the banking sector and stronger capital planning practices. Should we go\neven further? Given these firms’ systemic importance, and the history of government support\nprovided in prior financial crises, one might argue that more transparency might be beneficial\nand even justified. Increased transparency is likely to be most effective in providing market\ndiscipline for the largest banks, who have an active and attentive investor base to monitor their\nactivities and risk-taking. 4\nOn the other hand, for smaller banks where the capital is closely held or not widely\ntraded it might be more problematic to apply the same standard of transparency without risking\nharm to the institutions themselves and to the communities, and people, they serve. For example,\ndisclosing certain types of information might reveal potentially sensitive details about a smaller\ninstitution’s customers. And given many of these institutions’ size and governance structures,\ndisclosure might not result in the same positive effects possible in the case of larger institutions.\nAn individual smaller institution is unlikely to pose risk to financial stability, so without a\nsystematic way to disclose relevant information, the value of disclosure may be limited.\nA second consideration is the degree of detail included in disclosure and the types of\ninformation disclosed. The Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors has recently sought to increase\naccountability and transparency in aggregate through the publication of the Financial Stability\nReport and the Supervision and Regulation Report. 5 These reports offer the public greater insight\ninto the Federal Reserve’s approach to supervision, including observations on trends and broad\n\nBoard of Governors. 2009. \"The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: Overview of Results.\" May 7.\nGeorge, Esther. 2013. \"Effective Supervision: Balancing New and Traditional Approaches.\" Paris, November 22.\n5\nBoard of Governors. n.d. \"Financial Stability Report\" and \"Supervision and Regulation Report.\" Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, Publications.\n3\n4\n\n4\n\n\fthemes in supervision for both large and small institutions, and views on systemic risks. While\nthese reports include neither detailed nor firm-specific information, there may be opportunities\nfor greater transparency in sharing aggregated information about supervisory themes and trends.\nConsidering the type of information to be disclosed is important given that CSI is broadly\ndefined and includes information contained in exam reports, ratings, sensitive customer\ninformation, or proprietary business information, among others. 6 One aspect of this confidential\ninformation that frequently surfaces as a candidate for disclosure is key or material findings from\nexaminations.\nTypically, supervisors disclose material matters at the point of seeking corrective action,\nsuch as those included in formal enforcement actions. However, absent risks to financial\nstability, requiring banking organizations to disclose material findings could be useful. This\nwould also necessitate a careful consideration of the process by which such disclosure might\noccur and what, if any, standards might govern it. For example, would disclosure of supervisory\ncriticisms be best shared categorically by risk area, or verbatim?\nFinally, approaches for disclosure must contemplate how markets could react in times of\ncrisis or systemic stress. As already noted, the disclosure of stress testing results for larger\ninstitutions during the 2008 financial crisis played an important stabilizing role in reassuring the\npublic. However, no two crises are exactly alike, and it is difficult to know beforehand precisely\nwhat kind of information might help restore confidence in the financial system during the next\ncrisis. For example, in the late 1980s, Citi was the first bank to make a large provision against its\n\nFor the Board of Governors’ definition of CSI, see the Rules Regarding the Availability of Information, 12 C.F.R.\n§ 261, which describe the Board’s procedures for protecting confidential information as per the Freedom of\nInformation Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(8).\n6\n\n5\n\n\fLatin American exposures, and many thought the market would react negatively. 7 Instead, the\nnews had a positive effect, as markets wondered whether big banks were reserving enough or\nhad the capacity to do so.\n\nConclusion\nSupervisors and the industry need to weigh the implications of greater transparency for\nboth stability and better management of risk. Incorporating some degree of supervisory\ndiscretion rather than prescriptive statements or standards will likely be necessary.\nI look forward to the discussion and research coming out of this conference to guide our\nthinking on this important issue.\n\nSachs, Jeffery D. 1989. \"New Approaches to the Latin American Debt Crisis.\" Princeton University, International\nEconomics Section, Studies in International Economics, Essays in International Finance, No. 174.

It’s a pleasure to host this year’s conference with President Kaplan and\nhis team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Combined, our two Federal Reserve districts\nserve an area of the central United States that accounts for almost half of the nation’s energy\nproduction. This includes around 60 percent of its oil and gas production, as well as nearly 60\npercent of the electricity generated by wind power. Obviously, energy plays an important role in\nour regional economies and employs a substantial number of workers, but it is also a central\ncomponent of national economic activity with implications for monetary policy.\nMy remarks today will focus on this interaction of the energy sector and monetary policy.\nEnergy plays a key role in determining the environment in which monetary policy operates. It is\na direct component of economic output through production, employment and investment in the\nsector. Energy also creates indirect spillovers to other industries, government finances and\nconsumers. At the same time, monetary policy, through its effect on interest rates and asset\nprices, has implications for the energy sector, primarily by shaping aggregate demand, but also\nthrough its impact on commodity prices and perhaps the structure of the industry.\n\nEnergy Production: Booms and Busts\nI will start with some observations on energy’s role in shaping the economy. Given the\ndiscussion earlier today, and the expertise represented in the forum, I will only briefly touch on\nthe direct contribution of energy production to overall output, focusing primarily on tracing its\nindirect effects through other economic sectors. This is certainly not any indication of the lack of\nimportance of direct effects. Booms and busts in the oil sector have led to large swings in\nemployment and investment, particularly for regional economies that rely on the sector. Still, oil,\ngas and coal production accounts for roughly half a million jobs, or less than 1 percent of\n\n1\n\n\fnational employment and around 1 percent of domestic output. While the sector itself is not that\nlarge in those terms, the jobs tend to pay high wages, and movements in employment affect\nspending and consumption within many communities.\nEnergy extraction also has a direct effect on aggregate output through capital investment.\nIn particular, following the 2014 collapse in oil prices, energy investment took 2 percentage\npoints off overall business fixed investment growth in 2015 and 2016, contributing to the overall\nweakness of investment over this period.\nAmong the biggest shifts affecting the energy sector today is the growth of renewable\nenergy. Renewables now account for almost 20 percent of electricity generation, in part as the\ncost of solar power and wind power has fallen 85 and 70 percent, respectively, over the last\ndecade. 1 As renewables continue to reshape the energy industry, there are likely to be shifts in\nemployment, investment and output, with notable effects on regional economies.\nWhile much has been said about the difficulty in dealing with the short-term fluctuations\nin renewable power generation, employment and investment have been relatively smooth, with\nshifts more likely in response to lower costs and government incentives than to volatile demand.\nWith renewables continuing to gain market share, it may be that energy diminishes as a source of\nmacroeconomic volatility. Certainly, U.S. energy prices and output are likely to become more\ninsulated from global developments, the source of many energy sector shocks over the years.\nWithout the geopolitics, energy could well become more boring, which is maybe not such a bad\nthing.\nHowever, the direct effects of the energy sector likely capture only a small portion of the\noverall impact on economic output and growth. Energy is interwoven with all aspects of activity,\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.lazard.com/media/451419/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-140.pdf\n2\n\n\fand developments in energy spill over widely. Given that the channels linking energy to the\noverall economy are incredibly complex and wide-ranging, I’ll focus on four sectors —\nmanufacturing, agriculture, government finances and consumers—which I believe illustrate the\nbroader point: that an understanding of energy developments is essential for understanding\neconomic developments more generally, and therefore give context for monetary policy. In\nhighlighting these sectors, I will consider both cyclical movements, for example, the fall in oil\ndemand and prices related to the coronavirus, and longer-term structural developments often\ndriven by technological factors, such as fracking, the falling price of renewables, or the advent of\nelectric vehicles. Admittedly, separating cyclical and structural effects can sometimes be\ndifficult.\n\nManufacturing: Natural Gas and U.S. Comparative Advantage\nI’ll start with manufacturing. Energy is an important input into manufacturing, and\nfluctuations in the price and availability of energy have important spillovers for the sector. I will\nhighlight one aspect of this: how the decline in the price of natural gas relative to oil has boosted\nthe comparative advantage of U.S. manufacturing over the past decade, and how an increase in\nthe relative price of natural gas could unwind that advantage.\nAs technological advances led to a sharp increase in U.S. natural gas production starting\nin 2006, the higher supply pushed down the price of natural gas relative to the alternatives and\nled industries to substitute towards natural gas and away from other energy sources. This was\ntrue for utilities, as has been well reported, but also manufacturers. 2 The decline in the relative\n\nIn 2006, natural gas accounted for 28% of U.S. manufacturing energy usage. By 2018, it was 37%. Usage of natural\ngas liquids also rose from 11% to 15%. This mainly replaced coal and fuel oil (EIA, 2020:\nhttps://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=45156).\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\fprice of natural gas boosts the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing, in part because U.S.\nmanufacturers tend to use natural gas more extensively than their foreign competitors, who are\noften more oil-dependent. For example, oil’s share in manufacturing energy consumption is more\nthan five times higher in Europe than it is in the United States. 3 This difference in energy usage\nis particularly notable in the refinery, petrochemical and plastics industries.\nThis comparative advantage is apparent in performance of U.S. exports. United States\nexports of refined petroleum products, petrochemicals and plastics increased 160 percent over\nthe period from 2006 to 2019, while exports of the same products from Europe rose only 25\npercent. 4 During this period the United States became a leading exporter of gasoline and\npetroleum products and captured market share around the world. Overall, spillovers from low\nnatural gas prices were likely an important support for U.S. exports in recent years and a\ncontributor to the strength of economic growth.\nRecent developments, however, threaten this comparative advantage. This year, oil prices\nhave declined as natural gas prices have increased, in part as falling U.S. oil production has cut\nback on the supply of associated natural gas production. The relative price of Henry Hub natural\ngas to WTI oil fell by almost half over the period from 2006 to 2019, but ticked up by almost a\nthird this year. If such a shift in relative prices were to persist, and futures markets suggest that it\nwill, certain U.S. exports are likely to suffer a decline in competitiveness, and the aggregate\neconomy is likely to face an additional headwind as we continue our recovery.\n\nOil is less than 2 percent of U.S. manufacturers’ energy consumption (EIA), while it comprised 10.2 percent of\nEuropean industry consumption in 2017 (EEA).\n4\nData from WiserTrade, FRBKC calculations.\n3\n\n4\n\n\fAgriculture: Electric Cars Don’t Need Ethanol\nThe agricultural sector is also subject to spillovers from the energy sector, in part because\nagriculture is an energy-intensive industry, but also even more directly through ethanol. Corn\nused for ethanol accounts for more than a third of U.S. corn production. For perspective, the\nacreage devoted to corn destined for ethanol is equivalent to about 50,000 square miles, or 2/3\nthe area of the state of Nebraska. With demand for ethanol largely dependent on the demand for\ngasoline, fluctuations in gasoline consumption have important implications for the farm\neconomy. As the pandemic compressed gasoline demand, there were immediate spillovers to the\nagricultural economy, and demand for ethanol fell off sharply.\nIn addition to the cyclical linkages, longer-term trends in energy usage also have\nramifications for the agricultural sector. As motor vehicles have become more fuel efficient,\ndomestic demand for ethanol has flattened out, even as increased exports have continued to\nsupport production. Looking farther ahead, quick advances in the technology around electric\nvehicles, as well as aggressive government mandates promoting electric vehicles in China and\nelsewhere, pose further challenges to the long-run outlook for ethanol. Somewhat ironically, the\npush toward electric vehicles is likely a significant threat to what is currently one of the largest\nsources of renewable energy in the United States.\n\nGovernment: Finances under Threat\nAs energy-dependent states well understand, the performance of the energy sector also\nsignificantly affects state tax revenues and spending. Although severance taxes only make up\naround 1 percent of state tax revenues nationally, they play an outsized role in many energydependent states. Over the past five years, severance taxes have contributed more than 29 percent\n\n5\n\n\fof all state tax revenues in Wyoming and more than 45 percent of revenues in North Dakota and\nAlaska. Even in slightly more economically diversified states such as Texas, Oklahoma, West\nVirginia and New Mexico, severance taxes have exceeded 7 percent of state tax revenues on\naverage. 5\nFor states that rely on severance taxes, these tax streams are typically the most volatile\ncomponent of revenues and can lead to large swings in tax collections. 6 However, natural\nresource extraction has also been a blessing for many of these states, allowing them to build up\nlarge reserve funds in many cases. 7\nDuring the current crisis, most states have faced substantial budget shortfalls as tax\ncollections have fallen in almost every revenue category and pandemic-related government\nspending has risen. In energy states, sharp drops in severance taxes have exacerbated these\npandemic-related budget shortfalls. Thus, state governments in energy states are struggling.\nLarge reserve funds can help to offset some of the decline in tax revenues, but most of these\nstates will also be forced to make spending cuts over the next couple of years, likely creating a\nfurther headwind to the recovery.\nIn the longer term, many state governments in energy states will continue to look for\nways to not only diversify their economies, but also to diversify their revenue streams. This will\nbe particularly important for states that rely on revenue from commodities that are expected to\nface continued downward pressure over the longer term such as coal and natural gas. As one\nexample, coal lease bonus payments contributed more than $1 billion to school capital\n\nU.S. Census Bureau.

With households dependent on gasoline for transportation, changes in oil\nprices have a direct impact on household budgets. Higher gasoline prices decrease the amount\nthat can be spent on other goods, which can be a drag on consumption and the economy.\nSimilarly, lower gasoline prices boost the resources available to buy other goods and have\nhistorically supported consumption.\nHow important a gasoline price shock is to consumers depends on the share of gasoline in\ntotal expenditures. The lower the share of gasoline in total expenditures, the less important and\nthe less likely that a change in gas prices will have a meaningful effect on overall consumption.\nOver time, the amount of household budgets devoted to gasoline has been falling, from about 4\npercent in the 1980s to only about 2 percent in 2019, suggesting a declining importance of oil\nprice shocks to overall macroeconomic volatility. 9\nThat being said, the declining importance of oil in the aggregate masks considerable\nheterogeneity across the income distribution, with changes in gas prices being notably more\nimportant for low-income households. In the lowest-income quantile, gasoline accounted for\nmore than 8 percent of household income in 2019, more than five times the budget share of the\n\nhttp://eadiv.state.wy.us/creg/GreenCREG_Oct20.pdf\nTotal gasoline consumption increased by about 36% and 25% in the U.S. and the 10th District, respectively, from\nthe 1980s to 2018 (last annual data point for states).\n8\n9\n\n7\n\n\fhighest-income households. However, even for these lowest-income households, gasoline\naccounts for a smaller share in spending now than in the past.\nThe COVID-19 shock could further loosen the grip of gasoline prices on consumers’\nbudgets and reduce the already lowered sensitivity of consumption to changes in the price at the\npump. The pandemic dampened demand for gasoline as the volume of commuting fell off\nsharply with the rise in unemployment and increase in the number of employees working from\nhome. Gasoline sales in April were off by a third of their pre-pandemic level. While mobility has\nincreased with the lifting of stay-at-home restrictions, gasoline remains well below normal\nlevels. 10 One thing that seems unlikely to ever bounce back fully is the amount of commuting.\nWith many workplaces offering, or likely to offer, increased workplace flexibility, not only is\ngasoline demand likely to be lower, but it is also likely to be more elastic. More elastic demand\n(with the caveat that not all jobs are tele-workable) should lower the volatility of overall\nconsumption in response to gasoline price shocks.\nPutting it all together, developments in the energy sector have widespread effects across\nthe economy, both transmitting and amplifying near-term cyclical shifts, but also leading to\nlonger-term structural trends. Energy shapes the context for economic growth and inflation, in\nboth the near-term and long-run, arguing for monetary policymakers to keep a close eye on\nenergy dynamics.\n\nMonetary Policy’s Influence on the Energy Sector\nI will close with some thoughts on the influence of monetary policy on the energy sector.\nTo the extent that direct and indirect spillovers affect the economic outlook, and thus monetary\n\n10\n\nEIA and Affinity Solutions.\n8\n\n\fpolicy settings, it is worth considering how monetary policy, and particularly the prospect of\nlow-for-long interest rates, might affect the energy sector. There is a long literature that suggests,\nall else equal, that low interest rates should boost the price of storable commodities, such as oil,\npartly by incentivizing greater demand, but also by decreasing the incentive to produce. 11\nConverting oil reserves into currency and other assets is less appealing when the return on\nalternative assets is low. In addition, there is a literature that suggests that low rates should lead\nto less-volatile prices. Interest rates are an important cost of holding inventory, so low rates\nshould lower inventory costs and incentivize larger buffers that can then mitigate unexpected\nshifts in supply and demand. 12 Of course there are many other factors affecting oil prices besides\ninterest rates, so low oil prices and continued price volatility can certainly coincide with low-forlong rates.\nAgain relying on “all else equal,” low rates should incentivize investment in the energy\nsector, and generally, by decreasing the cost of capital. This could be particularly true in the\nrenewables sector, which has long-lived capital investment with high initial costs similar to\nutilities more generally. However, low interest rates can work not only by promoting new\nadditions to the capital stock, but also through the acquisition of pre-existing capital—that is by\nencouraging mergers and acquisitions. In an industry with uncertain near-term and long-term\ndemand, it might not be surprising to see low rates engender a greater response in M&A activity\nand consolidation as opposed to increased capital expenditure.\n\nSee Jeffery Frankel \"The Effect of Monetary Policy on Real Commodity Prices\", Chapter 7 in Asset Prices and\nMonetary Policy, John Campbell, ed.

            "content": "The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 8, 2020\nDelivered via video to the Kansas Economic Outlook Conference\nWichita State University\nWichita, Kansas\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives\n\n\fThank you for the opportunity to participate in this year’s Kansas Economic Outlook\nConference. In my remarks today, I’ll offer my thoughts on the U.S. economic outlook and the\ncurrent stance of monetary policy. I will also describe recent revisions to the Federal Reserve’s\napproach to setting monetary policy and how I see those changes influencing future policy\nchoices.\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe recovery from the second quarter’s historic fall off in economic activity has been\nmore rapid than expected by me, by financial markets, and by many of our business contacts.\nRetail sales have bounced back to pre-pandemic levels and the labor market has made up\nconsiderable ground, with half of the 22 million jobs that disappeared in March and April having\nreturned.\nTwo factors have been particularly important in driving the recovery. First, the rebound\nin activity reflects an evolution in the mechanisms for responding to the virus, as broadly\nimplemented lockdowns shift towards more targeted restrictions and to an increased willingness\nby the public to engage in certain activities. Second, policy support, both fiscal and monetary,\nhas played an essential role. It is particularly notable that even as wages and salaries fell a record\namount in the second quarter, personal income, which includes transfer payments from the\ngovernment, grew at the fastest pace in U.S. history and reached a new record high.\nMonetary policy has also played an important part in buffering the effects of the crisis.\nThe Fed responded quickly and aggressively, cutting its benchmark interest rate to near zero,\npurchasing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at an unprecedented scale,\nand establishing a number of new credit facilities to promote the flow of credit.\nWhile the recovery has so far been more pronounced than many expected, its gains have\nnot been evenly distributed, due in part to the unequal toll the pandemic has taken across sectors\nof the economy. Some sectors, such as restaurants, and many other services consumed outside\nthe home, have shown only a partial recovery, with some, such as movie theaters, still virtually\nshut down. Other sectors, including many durable consumption goods, have more than\nrecovered, with home improvements, personal computers, and bicycles all showing considerable\n\n1\n\n\fstrength. Low interest rates have undoubtedly boosted the purchase of durable goods and\nunderpinned the continued strength of the housing market.\nThe unevenness of the recovery is evident in the labor market as well. After peaking at\n14.7 percent in April, the unemployment rate fell back to 7.9 percent in September; we are\nmoving in the right direction, even if we still have a way to go. However, the sharp loss in jobs\nhas been concentrated almost entirely in service-providing industries, normally a relatively stable\npart of the economy. Particularly hard hit by the initial disruptions were the retail and leisure and\nhospitality industries, though I will note that these sectors have also seen the largest gains in\nsubsequent months. Another aspect of unevenness has been the disproportionate effect of the\ncrisis on women. The unemployment rate for women has moved from being below that of men\ngoing into the crisis to now being above.\nMany of the same dynamics that have been driving the national economy are at play here\nin Kansas. After spiking to almost 12 percent in April, the unemployment rate in Kansas has\nsince fallen back to below 7 percent; better, but still considerably above the less than 3 percent\nrate we saw in March. While most of the lost jobs have been in the services sector,\nmanufacturing has also taken a hit. This is most apparent in the aerospace sector, an important\nindustry here in Wichita, where employment has fallen 20 percent from March with no signs of\nrecovery. Given the global outlook for air travel and the airline industry, this weakness could\npersist for some time.\nThe crisis has also impacted agriculture. While many segments of the agricultural\nindustry in Kansas had already been under pressure before the crisis, the pandemic has\nexacerbated the challenges. The prices of many major agricultural commodities produced in\nKansas are lower today than before the crisis due, in part, to various disruptions connected to the\npandemic. And while government support programs may limit some financial stress this year for\nKansas farmers, headwinds in the sector appear likely to remain, and will also depend\nsignificantly on the course of the pandemic.\nThough I have been encouraged by the pace of recovery, substantial risks to the outlook\nremain, with two deserving particular attention. First is the virus itself. As the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) has noted, the path of the economy will depend significantly on the\ncourse of the virus. A resurgence in the virus and the renewed imposition of control measures\nwould likely throw the recovery off track. Already we have seen this dynamic play itself out to\n2\n\n\fvarious degrees in Europe where cases have spiked again in many countries after falling over the\nsummer. The economy is unlikely to fully recover until the virus no longer interferes with the\npublic’s day-to-day decision-making. That seems ultimately to depend on confidence that the\nvirus can be effectively managed, such as with a vaccine.\nSecond, individuals and small businesses have been able to resume economic activity\nthrough substantial fiscal support. As the virus persists, and the funding provided to date\ndissipates, the recovery could stall. One sector that poses a particular risk is spending by state\nand local governments that have boosted spending on public health measures, while at the same\ntime experiencing significantly lower tax collections. With deteriorating budget positions, state\nand local governments are cutting spending, and have already furloughed and laid off workers,\nleading to over a million fewer jobs in the sector relative to February.\nIn summary, the recovery has been encouragingly fast, but the risks around the outlook\nare substantial. We are not out of the woods yet.\nThe Federal Reserve’s Framework Review and the Outlook for Monetary Policy\nBefore turning to the outlook for monetary policy, I think it is important to provide some\nbackground on the recent revisions to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework. The\nrevisions marked the culmination of a process that was launched in early 2019, when the Federal\nReserve began a review of how to best conduct monetary policy in an economic environment\nthat has undergone some notable changes in recent decades. While the review pre-dated the\npandemic and was targeted at longer-run structural changes in the economy, the pandemic has\namplified many of these changes.\nTwo developments in particular have made the conduct of monetary policy more\nchallenging in recent years. First, interest rates have fallen to levels that once seemed almost\nunthinkable, not just in the United States, but around the world. These lower rates have resulted,\nat least in part, from structural changes that have increased the amount that households and\nbusinesses want to save, while at the same time lowering the amount of desired investment.\nThese changes include sluggish economic growth, coincident with lagging productivity, and an\naging population. Regardless of the cause, lower interest rates reduce the capacity of the Federal\nReserve to stimulate the economy, when necessary, through the traditional method of lowering\nthe policy interest rate.\n3\n\n\fThe second key development is that inflation dynamics have shifted such that the link\nbetween the pace of economic activity and inflation appears to have weakened. For some time,\ninflation has remained persistently low, even when the economy appeared to produce above its\npotential. Policymakers have seen that far lower levels of unemployment have been achieved\nwithout triggering inflationary pressures. This shift in inflation dynamics has prompted the\nFederal Reserve to rethink its monetary policy response.\nIt is intuitive that rising prices are viewed negatively by households unsure of how\nquickly, or even if, their own incomes will be increasing. And certainly, there is a consensus,\nbacked by considerable historical experience, that too high inflation is bad for households and\nthe economy.\nLow inflation on the other hand is generally associated with low interest rates, and low\ninterest rates pose a constraint on the Federal Reserve’s ability to the stabilize the economy.\nFurthermore, low inflation can beget even lower inflation, if households and businesses start to\nanticipate it and shift down their expectations for inflation in the future. Under such conditions,\ncentral bankers worry that inflation expectations and actual inflation could spiral dangerously\ndownward, further constraining monetary policy. Without the space to cut interest rates, the\nFederal Reserve is likely to have to rely more on asset purchases and other non-interest rate\npolicies to address downturns in the economy. Though these policies have been viewed as\neffective, they can come at some cost. In particular, balance sheet policies have implications for\nfinancial imbalances, resource misallocation, and a further expansion of the Fed’s footprint in\nfinancial markets.\nFaced with a changed economy, the Federal Reserve changed its monetary policy\nframework in two significant aspects. First, the Committee clarified that it will accommodate\nlow rates of unemployment. That is to say, policy would not be tightened in response to low\nunemployment in the absence of signs of sustained upward pressure on inflation. Prior to the\npandemic, unemployment reached historically low levels for some time without causing an\nundesirable increase in inflation and it had become increasingly clear that defining a precise\nnumber for maximum employment was likely not appropriate. As a result, the FOMC’s\nframework would not call for preempting inflation by tightening policy on the basis of tight labor\nmarkets alone.\n\n4\n\n\fSecond, while maintaining its 2 percent inflation target in the longer run, the FOMC will\nnow aim to achieve this objective by targeting an inflation rate that averages 2 percent over time.\nThus, following periods when inflation has fallen persistently below 2 percent, the Committee\nwould allow inflation to run above 2 percent for a period of time.\nWhile the change to average inflation targeting may seem quite technical, let me explain\nhow I see this adjustment affecting our policy decisions. My long-held view is that inflation\nrunning a bit under 2 percent or a bit above 2 percent is consistent with a longer-run 2 percent\ninflation objective. Given the volatility of inflation, and the imprecision with which it is\nmeasured, I have generally not been concerned by an inflation rate a few tenths off target on\neither side of 2 percent.\nBy allowing inflation to move above 2 percent for some time, the framework makes clear\nthat the 2 percent target is not a ceiling on inflation. Monetary policy is most effective at steering\ninflation at longer horizons. The 2 percent objective provides the public a guidepost for the longrun. While the new consensus statement elaborates that this 2 percent long-run target is viewed\nthrough the lens of average inflation outcomes, no timetable for averaging was specified,\navoiding a sense of undue precision over inflation outcomes. Instead, I interpret the revised\nconsensus statement as a tolerance — and less as a promise to engineer — for inflation\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time. Moreover, inflation should, in my view, continue to\nbe viewed in the context of broader economic outcomes. Inflation temporarily and moderately\nabove 2 percent is unlikely to warrant a policy response if the economy is otherwise functioning\nwell.\nThe term “average” has attracted a lot of attention among the cottage industry of Fed\nwatchers. From my standpoint, I see little benefit in getting too tied up in a precise mathematical\nformulation of “average.” The challenge of adopting a precise definition of “average” inflation\nhas familiar parallels to the challenges of adopting precise monetary policy rules. There are\nreasons why the FOMC has in the past avoided strict adherence to monetary policy rules, so it is\nunsurprising that the new framework is not a precise prescription for policy actions. The\nstructure of the economy changes over time, as acknowledged by the framework review, and the\nFOMC’s credibility will come from its flexibility in adapting to new circumstances rather than\nadhering to a formula.\n\n5\n\n\fAt its September meeting, the FOMC moved to adjust policy in light of its revised\nframework. In particular, the Committee provided forward guidance that it expects to keep the\npolicy rate near zero until inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2\npercent for some time. I view this guidance as consistent with a message of patience. We are\nsignaling that the committee is unlikely to preemptively tighten policy at the prospect that\ninflation is approaching 2 percent, but rather a willingness to wait until the data confirms its\narrival.\nGiven an unsettled outlook for inflation, it is not yet clear how much patience will be\nrequired. The pandemic has affected prices in a variety of ways, and it will be difficult to assess\nthe underlying pace of inflation until the dust settles. While overall inflation has weakened with\nthe pandemic, the decline largely reflects the weight of a few sectors hard hit by a virus-induced\ncollapse in demand. Many other sectors have seen inflation step up, due to supply disruptions or\nstrong demand. In fact, looking at the change in prices across the individual categories that\ncomprise consumer spending, more categories have recorded higher inflation than lower inflation\nsince the onset of the pandemic. Good news on the virus could quickly boost inflation back to, or\neven above, 2 percent.\nHowever, if the pandemic were to unleash a deeper and more prolonged recession, the\ndrag on prices could be more pronounced. The Committee’s recent interest rate guidance would\nsuggest this would lead to a longer period of accommodative policy.\nWhile the Committee has offered relatively explicit guidance for policy rates, it has so far\nprovided only minimal guidance on another aspect of policy; that is the trajectory of our asset\npurchases, primarily Treasuries and Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), and its intentions\nregarding the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet. Following disruptions in financial\nmarkets in March, the Fed began purchasing large quantities of Treasuries and MBS. These\nactions proved very effective in calming financial markets, even as the pandemic exacted a\ntremendous toll on the real economy.\nWith market functioning having largely returned to pre-pandemic conditions, the\nSeptember policy statement broadened the objective of asset purchases to include fostering\naccommodative financial conditions. It will be important to provide further detailed guidance on\nthe Committee’s intentions regarding these purchases. This is a matter of transparency and\n\n6\n\n\faccountability, but also an important element of ensuring the effectiveness of the purchases. I\nlook forward to discussing these issues with my colleagues.\nEven as the economy continues to recover, the risks that lie ahead cannot be\nunderestimated. The Federal Reserve has been active in its support of the recovery and we will\ncontinue to monitor the economy’s progress closely.\n\n7\n\n\f"

I’ll begin by talking for a few minutes about\nthe Federal Reserve’s response to the crisis and some of the immediate issues we saw in the\nbanking sector early on. I will then turn to the importance of community banks throughout this\nperiod. I’ll also offer some considerations on how the pandemic could shape banking going\nforward, with a particular emphasis on industry concentration. 1\nThe Fed’s Crisis Response\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, and the actions required to contain it, have had a profound\nimpact on the U.S. economy and financial system. As the virus spread throughout the country,\nthe economic outlook deteriorated sharply. In March, businesses began to slow production or\nclose their doors and consumers reduced spending, both as they withdrew from economic\nactivity and to buffer against an impending downturn. These actions, and the continued\nuncertainty around the virus’s projected path, sparked a full-scale economic recession and\nfinancial panic.\nThe Federal Reserve’s unprecedented actions to support the economy during the\npandemic involved a combination of conventional and unconventional monetary tools and\ndiscount window lending. Borrowing from the Financial Crisis playbook, the Federal Reserve\nissued credit to a number of financial actors including primary dealers, commercial banks,\nmoney market funds, and special purpose vehicles holding asset-backed securities in order to\nfacilitate the continued flow of credit into the real economy. In an unprecedented step, the\nFederal Reserve joined with the U.S. Treasury to issue credit to non-financial firms and local\ngovernments. These programs require the Federal Reserve to take on some amount of credit risk,\nand as such they are backed by an equity stake from the U.S. Treasury. In addition, the Federal\nReserve purchased sizable amounts of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to ensure that\ncapital markets continued to remain liquid and open to investors.\n\nI thank Rajdeep Sengupta, Blake Marsh and Nick Baker of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for their\nassistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\fThe Federal Reserve’s actions rely on commercial banks as a conduit to channel funds\ninto the real economy, and we have taken steps to ensure that banks can continue to lend. For\nexample, the U.S. Treasury provided loans to businesses under the Payroll Protection Program\n(PPP) made through partner lending institutions. By taking extraordinary measures to reach out\nto customers and work with existing borrowers, small banks accounted for 40 percent of the\nprogram’s total lending. This surge in lending, however, resulted in reduced balance sheet\ncapacity for participating banks. In response, the Federal Reserve established the PPP liquidity\nfacility, which accepts these loans as collateral in order to free up cash for additional lending. 2\nCapital regulations for certain asset classes and loan types were also eased to facilitate Treasury\nmarket functioning and to blunt the balance sheet impact of business lending.\nOther aspects of the crisis response have also importantly involved banks. The CARES\nAct authorized forbearance programs to ease payment pressures on a number of consumer loan\nproducts. Forbearance allows consumers to delay payment of their loans until employment\nconditions return to more-normal levels and helps banks conserve capital by avoiding\ndelinquencies that become charge-offs down the road. In this aspect, the banking agencies are\ncommitted to working with banks to find acceptable ways to mitigate loan losses throughout the\nremainder of the pandemic. Preserving bank capital and keeping credit flowing throughout the\neconomy is essential.\nThe Early Impact of the Pandemic on the Banking Sector\nDuring the early days of the crisis, businesses turned to banks of all sizes in an effort to\nprotect themselves against rising economic and financial stress. Precautionary draws on existing\nlines of credit increased sharply in March as firms tried to cover expected revenue declines. At\nthe same time, deposits flowed into the banking system as a flight-to-quality ensued and both\nfirms and investors showed a preference for holding cash over other financial assets.\nThe effects of the crisis varied among banks of different sizes and operating models.\nWhile balance sheets grew quickly across the banking universe, large banks experienced the\nmajority of the loan draws and deposit inflows and, therefore, bore the brunt of the immediate\n\nCommunity banks have been important users of the PPPLF with 50 percent of current total take up, or $34 billion,\nas of August 31, 2020.\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\fpandemic-related activity. Smaller banks quickly engaged with borrowers to assess their needs\nand offered payment deferral.\nTo date, few stresses have emerged across banks despite the severe economic contraction.\nThe level of problem assets reported by banks in the second quarter remained at historic lows,\nand capital buffers, despite declining as balance sheets grew, stayed above regulatory minimums.\nThe resilience of the banking system certainly reflects stronger capital and liquidity positions\nbuilt up over the last decade. The response of fiscal and monetary policy to support households\nand businesses, along with actions taken by the banking agencies to offer aspects of supervisory\nand regulatory relief, has undoubtedly muted the impact to banking conditions so far.\nThe economic recovery, however, is far from complete. Strains on household and\ncommercial balance sheets since March have created fragilities that could yet threaten bank\nprofitability and loss-absorbing capacity for some time. Adequate capital is critically important\nfor the safety and soundness of banks, as well as for the continued provisioning of credit that\nkeeps our financial system and our economy functioning during periods of stress. There is\nwidespread consensus among economists and policymakers that bank capital not only serves as a\nbuffer against unexpected losses and insolvency, but also mitigates excessive risk-taking\nincentives. Higher capital levels reduce the probability of failure and crises, and better\ncapitalized banks can hasten a post-crisis recovery.\nThe Pandemic and Community Banks\nCommunity banks continue to be central to the health of local communities and\ncollectively to the health of the nation’s economy. This is particularly true for the access to credit\nrequired for small businesses, which have been hit hard by the pandemic. These businesses\nemployed 60 million people or 47 percent of the private workforce in 2016. 3 As of August, both\nsmall business revenue and employment were down 19 percent since the beginning of the year. 4\nCommunity banks are particularly well-situated to understand the needs of small- to\nmedium-sized businesses where local knowledge and lending relationships exist. These\nrelationships prompted community bankers to reach out and offer assistance to their customers\nearly in the pandemic. It is has also been evident in the launch of the Federal Reserve’s Main\n3\n4\n\nhttps://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142719/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-US.pdf\nhttps://tracktherecovery.org/\n\n3\n\n\fStreet Loan Facility. Among the more than 500 registered lenders, the overwhelming majority\nare community banks. And to date, nearly half of the loans purchased by the facility have been\nextended by community banks. Although there has been some criticism that this program has not\nbeen more widely utilized, it appears that the program is serving its intended purpose, and\nbroader use of this funding may be a function of specific terms and operational needs.\nIn responding to the crisis, community and regional banks have taken prompt action to\nstrengthen balance sheets in light of expected future credit losses. This is evident in the\nbolstering of loan loss reserves in the first two quarters of this year. 5 For many community\nbanks, commercial real estate and agricultural lending are cornerstones of the business model; as\nsuch, concentration risk warrants ongoing attention as strained business revenues and commodity\nprices threaten the ability of some borrowers to repay their obligations. 6 Thus, community\nbankers must remain vigilant.\nAs you well know, the banking landscape has changed significantly over the past three\ndecades. Industry-wide consolidation over this period has increasingly led to the concentration of\nbanking assets in large banking organizations, with the highest concentration of assets within the\neight U.S. banks known as the G-SIBs, or global systemically important banks. At the turn of the\ncentury, U.S. G-SIBs held one-third of total banking assets and generated around 40 percent of\nindustry profits. As of year-end 2019, G-SIBs account for 60 percent of both the banking\nindustry’s assets and its profits. The financial crisis led to a wave of bank failures and mergers\nthat contributed to the ongoing consolidation. Despite the resolution of many failed banks during\nthe crisis (2007-10), unassisted mergers accounted for more of the increased concentration than\nthe resolution of failed banks. 7 While it is always difficult to forecast economic trends,\nconsolidation in the banking industry has continued since the mid-1980s and is likely to continue\nin the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nSecond quarter 2020 data shows substantial provision expense across banks of all sizes.\nRisks also noted in the Federal Reserve’s May 2020 Financial Stability Report:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-may-financial-stability-report-purpose.htm\n7 David C. Wheelock, 2011. \"Banking industry consolidation and market structure: impact of the financial crisis and\nrecession,\" Review, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, vol. 93(Nov), pages 419-438.\n5\n6\n\n4\n\n\fRecent changes to the operating environment in banking are likely to exacerbate this\ntrend of consolidation. Most economists and policymakers believe that because of differences in\nsize, interconnectedness, complexity, and cross-jurisdictional activity, larger banks should hold\nrelatively more capital than their smaller counterparts. And yet, despite the lessons of the\nfinancial crisis and as mentioned previously, critical capital ratios at community banks have been\npersistently higher than that at the largest banks. 8 Community banks entered this extreme shock\nwith leverage capital at a 20-year high and a collective leverage ratio 270 basis points above that\nof the GSIBs. 9 This capital advantage undoubtedly affects the competitive environment for\ncommunity banks. Moreover, recent regulatory changes intended to provide significant capital\nrelief to the largest banks not only raise concerns about financial stability but also could further\nwiden the difference in capital ratios between small and large banks. Capital regulation is\ncreating incentives for banks to grow significantly larger.\nCommunity banks have also noted the challenges they face with persistently low interest\nrates as another important factor in this operating environment. While low-for-long interest rates\nnegatively affect net interest margins for all banks, margin compression puts community banks at\na disadvantage relative to large banks because it is their principal source of income. In contrast,\nlarge banks can rely on alternative sources of (noninterest) income such as trading revenues and\nintermediation fees to offset any decrease in interest margins. From the standpoint of community\nbanks, the large bank model that relies on transactional lending and fee-based income while\nholding relatively less capital becomes increasingly attractive. In short, both regulation and\nmonetary policy appear to be tilting the scales in favor of large banks.\nSome argue that efforts to ease capital requirements are necessary to support the\nprovision of credit to individuals and businesses. I do not find this argument compelling. The\nFederal Reserve’s most recent Senior Loan Officer Lending Survey indicated that no large banks\nconsidered their current or expected capital position a “very important” reason in their\ndetermination of credit standards. 10 Additionally, large banks benefiting from this change have\nmade significant distributions to shareholders since the pandemic began. These large banks\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City publishes a horizontal comparison of capital adequacy among banking\norganizations with different risk profiles: https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/bankingandpayments/bca.\n9\nIbid.\n10\nJuly 2020 Senior Loan Officer Survey: https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos/sloos-202007.htm.\n8\n\n5\n\n\fdistributed more than $50 billion of capital through shareholder dividends and share repurchases\nin the first six months of this year, representing the equivalent of nearly $1 trillion in balance\nsheet capacity. 11\nTo be sure, regulatory relief during this pandemic likely has played a role in ensuring that\nbanks are able to continue to serve as financial intermediaries. But once the crisis has passed,\nmaintaining robust capital levels at the largest banks will be essential to the nation’s economic\nand financial stability and to the long-term health of a diverse banking system.\nThere are of course other factors, beyond regulatory incentives, behind banking\nconsolidation trends. Transformational changes in information technology and payments systems\nalso have been important forces that have yielded significant efficiency gains from consolidation,\nespecially in the early years after branching deregulation in the mid-1990s. This consolidation, of\ncourse, raises concerns. With policies favoring a banking model that relies on transactional\nlending and fee-based incomes, a traditional model of banking that relies on lending relationships\nand local knowledge faces pressure. Numerous studies, including research on the Financial\nCrisis, have shown that, despite the technology and efficiency gains, abandoning the traditional\nmodel has often yielded worse lending outcomes. 12\nExtending broad access to payment systems has long been an objective of the Federal\nReserve. As scale and network effects begin to dominate the landscape for instant payment\nmethods, community and regional banks have expressed a desire to provide access to their\ncustomers. To facilitate access to faster payments, the Federal Reserve will provide a new\npayment service called FedNow, providing public benefits related to the safety, efficiency, and\naccessibility of instant payments, specifically through its ability to reach more than 10,000 of the\ncountry’s diverse depository institutions, including community banks and rural customers. The\npandemic itself has highlighted the need for this capability to expedite payments as the\ngovernment issued Economic Impact Payments to millions of Americans.\n\nDistribution data contained in second quarter financial reports. $1 trillion is an estimate using a 15x multiple\n(5% minimum = 3% SLR minimum + 2% Leverage buffer to avoid distribution limitations).\n12\nSee, for example, Patrick Bolton & Xavier Freixas & Leonardo Gambacorta & Paolo Emilio Mistrulli, 2016.\n\"Relationship and Transaction Lending in a Crisis,\" Review of Financial Studies, Society for Financial Studies, vol.\n29(10), pages 2643-2676.\n11\n\n6\n\n\fConclusion\nThe fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic has been extraordinary, and the\nbanking industry has played an essential role in supporting this response and providing credit to\nhouseholds and business. Community banks in particular have been indispensable in maintaining\naccess to credit for small business and in doing so have served the needs of local communities as\nwell as contributed to the nation’s economic recovery. To be sure, the banking industry must\nnavigate the path to economic recovery, and community banks face the particular challenges of\nindustry concentration and consolidation. Finding ways to address these challenges will shape\nthe diversity of the nation’s banks and the crucial role they play as catalysts of the recovery.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "The Coronavirus Shock: Implications for the Economy and Monetary Policy\n\nRemarks by\nEsther George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJune 25, 2020\nDelivered Virtually to the Economic Club of Kansas City\nKansas City, Mo.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fI would like to thank the Economic Club of Kansas City for the opportunity to meet with\nyou today. In my discussion, I will review the tremendous hit to the economy inflicted by the\ncoronavirus, before highlighting some recent indicators that suggest a recovery is underway,\nincluding across the seven states of the Tenth Federal Reserve District that is served by the\nKansas City Fed. This is a region that spans much of the central plains from western Missouri\nthrough Colorado, Wyoming and northern New Mexico. I will then discuss the extraordinary\npolicy response, both fiscal and monetary, that is underlying this recovery, closing with a\ndiscussion of the economic outlook, and the implications of that outlook for monetary policy.\nThe past few months have been a challenging time for our economy and our nation. The\ncoronavirus pandemic has led to a public health emergency unlike any in modern times.\nMeasures taken to control the virus have delivered an unprecedented shock to economic activity,\nboth nationally and in the Tenth District.\nThe economy entered recession in February, with real output falling 5 percent in the first\nquarter of the year, the most significant decline since late 2008, and a widespread expectation\nthat activity will decline at a record pace in the second quarter. A tremendous number of\nAmericans have lost their jobs since March, pushing the unemployment rate up from one of its\nlowest levels in half a century to the highest readings in the post-war era in just a matter of\nmonths.\nThe coronavirus recession has some unique elements. Modern recessions have typically\nresulted from imbalances within the economy that become unstable over time, either as\neconomic demand exceeds supply leading to a buildup in inflation or as financial imbalances\nunwind after an unsustainable build up. However, the coronavirus shock came from outside the\neconomy. An otherwise healthy economy was more or less put into a medically induced coma to\n\n1\n\n\fprotect the public’s health with policies that allowed only businesses deemed essential to remain\nopen.\nThe nature of the measures taken to combat the coronavirus also have differentiated the\ncurrent recession from past recessions. The need for social distancing has taken a particularly\nheavy toll on the consumption of services. The services sector is often relatively stable in a\ndownturn; this time services are leading the decline.\n\nLABOR MARKET DEVELOPMENTS\nOne consequence of the services-led downturn has been that certain parts of the labor\nmarket have been hit harder than others. Almost two-thirds of the 22 million jobs lost in March\nand April were concentrated in three broad industries: leisure and hospitality, education and\nhealth services, and retail trade. The vast majority of the 8 million layoffs in leisure and\nhospitality was concentrated in highly socially interactive sectors, including accommodations,\nrestaurants and bars. Within education and health services, dentist and physician offices cut\nmany workers, as did daycare providers. While we saw strong job gains in these industries in\nMay, with employment increasing by 2 million jobs, a full recovery is still far off.\nIt is notable that, partly as a consequence of the sectoral distribution of layoffs, different\ndemographic groups, though all suffering large declines in employment, have been affected to\nvarying degrees. The increase in the unemployment rate has been particularly pronounced for\nHispanic workers, increasing from 4.4 percent in February to 17.6 percent in May. AfricanAmerican workers have also seen a large increase in unemployment, from 5.8 percent in\nFebruary to 16.8 percent in May. It is also concerning that, unlike most demographic groups, the\nunemployment rate for African-Americans showed no improvement in May relative to April\n\n2\n\n\feven as the overall economy added millions of jobs. Similar to previous recessions, younger\nworkers also have been especially hard hit by job losses.\nA particular feature of the current recession is that women have suffered disproportionate\njob losses, in contrast to their relative performance in the typical recession. 1 Women held more\njobs in the hardest-hit industries and a majority of these women did not have a college degree.\nConsequently, the unemployment rate of non-college-educated women rose more than fourfold\nfrom 4.5 percent in February to almost 21 percent in April, a far larger increase than experienced\nby men with similar educational background. A similar imbalance was also observed for collegeeducated men and women, though to a slightly lessor degree. Overall, women went from having\nan unemployment rate below their male counterparts in February to a far higher rate after the\ncoronavirus shock.\n\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS\nAlthough every part of the United States experienced dramatic decreases in activity,\nstates in the Tenth District have fared slightly better, likely due to the lower case counts\nexperienced in the region. 2 All the same, more than 21 percent of the Tenth District labor force\nhas filed for unemployment benefits since mid-March, with employment in the leisure and\nhospitality sector recording a dramatic 44 percent decline in the region.\nMore recently, as stay-at-home orders and other restrictions on activity have been lifted\nwe have started to see signs of recovery, both in the Tenth District and nationally. Because there\n\nDidem Tuzemen and Thao Tran. 2020. “Women Take a Bigger Hit in the First Wave of Job Losses due to COVID19.” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Economic Bulletin, April 16.\n2\nFor further detail on the economic effects of the pandemic, see Jason Brown and Alison Felix. 2020. “COVID-19\nStuns U.S. and Tenth District Economies, but Both Show Signs of Stabilization.” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity, Economic Bulletin, June 17.\n1\n\n3\n\n\fis a lag in the official data, economists at the Kansas City Fed and elsewhere have been\nmonitoring more timely, but less traditional, indicators of activity. One of these measures is foot\ntraffic to businesses. Foot traffic in mid-April was down 60 percent relative to early March in\nboth the U.S. and the Tenth District. Traffic began to improve by late April, and has picked up\nslightly faster in the Tenth District, where stay-at-home orders were lifted earlier. As of early\nJune, foot traffic relative to the first week in March was down about 25 percent in the District\nversus 35 percent for the nation as a whole, still depressed but a considerable improvement\nrelative to where we were in April.\n\nTHE FISCAL POLICY RESPONSE\nThe pick-up that we have seen has been importantly supported by some of the swiftest\nand most aggressive fiscal policy actions on record. In March and April, Congress enacted four\nbills related to the current pandemic and economic crisis, providing an estimated $2.9 trillion of\nfiscal support to the economy, including one-time direct payments to households, an expansion\nof unemployment benefits, forgivable loans to small businesses, and support for new Federal\nReserve lending facilities. 3 These fiscal measures are unprecedented not only in terms of their\nsize, but also in terms of how rapidly they were enacted. As a comparison, following the 2008\nfinancial crisis, Congress provided a total of $2.5 trillion of fiscal support to the economy,\nenacted over a two-year span from 2008 to 2010.\nSo far, increased transfer payments from the government, including importantly both\ndirect payments and increased unemployment benefits, have covered the loss of income for many\n\nThe CARES Act allows employers and self-employed people to defer Social Security taxes from March 2020\nthrough December 2021. The CBO estimates that the federal government will reduce revenues over 2020-21, but\nincrease revenues over 2022-23. Including this deferral, while excluding the estimated revenue increases over\n2022-23, brings the total fiscal package to $3.6 trillion.\n3\n\n4\n\n\fhouseholds. As a result, economy-wide disposable income actually increased in April despite a\nsharp fall in wage income. However, the coronavirus is affecting household economic prospects\ndifferently, often depending on how easily jobs can be transitioned to a remote work\nenvironment. Relatively secure and highly paid jobs are most often the easiest jobs to make\nremote, while relatively low-paying jobs are overwhelmingly less amenable to remote delivery.\n\nTHE FEDERAL RESERVE’S POLICY RESPONSE\nThe Federal Reserve has also responded quickly and aggressively to the developing\ncoronavirus crisis. Credit conditions tightened at an unprecedented pace as the pandemic spread\nand states and local jurisdictions began to issue shelter-in-place and quarantine orders. Economic\nstrains apparent in early March developed into a fully-realized financial panic weeks later when\ninvestors fled risky assets resulting in sharp asset price declines, increased debt spreads, and\nnotable deterioration in market liquidity. Commercial banks experienced draws on existing lines\nof credit, shadow banks saw funding runs, and short-term corporate debt issuance stalled as\ninvestors flocked to the safety and liquidity of cash and shorter maturity government securities.\nEven conditions in markets typically considered safe-havens, such as longer-dated Treasuries\nand agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, became strained. 4\nThe severity of the liquidity crisis threatened to exacerbate the economic contraction\nfrom the pandemic, prompting a forceful response from the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC). On March 3, the FOMC reduced its benchmark rate 50 basis points in response to\nburgeoning economic stress before ultimately cutting the target rate to zero a few weeks later due\nto rising financial strains. Credit conditions finally began to ease around March 23 after the\nKarlye Dilts Steadman, 2020. “Measuring Liquidity Risk in Treasury Markets: The G-Spread” Economic Bulletin,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, forthcoming.\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\fFOMC announced purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in\nthe amounts needed to facilitate orderly market functioning, and established new credit facilities\nto promote the flow of credit.\nIn addition to FOMC actions, liquidity facilities administered by the Federal Reserve\nhave helped to further ease financial conditions and improve market functioning. Commercial\nbanks, for example, have been encouraged to borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount\nwindow to maintain the flow of credit in the face of increased demand by businesses. At the\nsame time, the Federal Reserve has established a number of temporary liquidity facilities that\nmake short-term loans against safe collateral to address illiquidity at nonbanks. 5 These\ntemporary facilities are largely guided by the Federal Reserve's 2007-09 crisis-era experience,\nthough their scope has been expanded to include a wider variety of accepted collateral and a\nlarger number of eligible participants. Domestically, these facilities aim to ensure credit remains\navailable to U.S. businesses and local governments. For example, the Federal Reserve has\nintervened directly in the commercial paper market to facilitate the flow of short-term credit to\ncorporations. Globally, the Federal Reserve has established swap lines with other central banks\nso that U.S. dollar funding is widely available abroad.\nThe sudden nature of the coronavirus shock, however, presents unique and unprecedented\nfinancial challenges for businesses and local governments. While the Federal Reserve’s initial\nresponses eased short-term funding stresses, additional actions were required to address longerterm concerns. In a significant departure from the 2007-09 crisis-era policy, the Federal Reserve\njoined the U.S. Treasury, as authorized under the CARES Act, to provide temporary relief to\nlocalities and businesses to offset revenue losses. Examples include programs that lend directly\nRajdeep Sengupta & Fei Xue, 2020. \"The Global Pandemic and Run on Shadow Banks,\" Economic Bulletin, Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, issue May 11, 2, pages 1-5, May.\n5\n\n6\n\n\fto smaller businesses with limited access to external capital markets, programs that provide\nliquidity to financial institutions participating in the Treasury’s Paycheck Protection Program,\nand direct intervention in corporate bond, corporate loan, and local government bond markets. 6\nThese longer-term interventions require the Federal Reserve to take on more credit risk than that\nassumed by short-term liquidity facilities, and, as such, are backed by an equity stake from the\nU.S. Treasury, which will absorb any losses. To the extent that these funds can assist businesses\nand local governments in maintaining their operations, however, they help lay the foundation for\na quicker recovery once the pandemic abates.\nSo far, Federal Reserve actions appear successful. Markets are largely functioning in an\norderly fashion and debt spreads are near pre-pandemic levels for highly rated borrowers.\nMoreover, utilization rates at some liquidity facilities and the discount window have declined,\nwhile market activity has resumed, suggesting that liquidity conditions have improved.\n\nTHE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\nThe improvement in financial conditions should further support a rebound in economic\nactivity backed by fiscal support and a further relaxation of virus-related restrictions, however,\nthere are a number of risks that could hold up the recovery.\nMost important is the course of the virus itself. A renewed upsurge in infections and\nresumed social distancing, either mandatory or voluntary, is likely to be a persistent risk, at least\nuntil a vaccine has been developed or treatment options sufficiently improve.\nPutting aside the direct effects of the virus, there are other elements of the health crisis\nthat are likely to prolong the recovery. One risk is that consumers and businesses react to the new\nHuixin Bi & Jacob Dice & Chaitri Gulati & W. Blake Marsh, 2020. \"Understanding the Recent Rise in Municipal\nBond Yields,\" Economic Bulletin, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 27.\n6\n\n7\n\n\funcertainty introduced by the virus by pulling back on consumption and investment with the goal\nof building precautionary buffers against future disruptions. While rational at the individual\nlevel, such a pullback can hamper growth across the wider economy.\nAnother risk comes from the global economy. Foreign demand for U.S. exports had\nalready been weak for some time before the crisis. Now, with the virus rolling across foreign\neconomies at varying times and intensities, it seems unlikely that we should expect much support\nfrom overseas as our economy picks back up.\nFinally, while fiscal policy is currently providing substantial support for growth, there is\na risk that the impetus from fiscal policy will turn negative before the recovery has been fully\nrealized. The coronavirus pandemic has created serious financial consequences for state and\nlocal governments, which unlike the federal government, must balance their budgets. In the near\nterm, governments are facing liquidity challenges, as many tax deadlines have been postponed,\nleading to massive drops in income tax collections this spring. Also, shelter-in-place orders have\nsharply reduced consumer spending, thereby lowering sales tax collections. At the same time that\nstate revenues are under pressure, the demand for state services, including spending on medical\nsupplies and temporary health facilities, is growing. Although funding from the CARES Act,\nwhich allocated $150 billion in direct aid to state and local governments, including over $11\nbillion for states in the Tenth District, will help states cover some of the costs associated with\nCovid-19 and partially fill budget gaps in the short term, strains are likely to intensify. Indeed,\nmany states are already making difficult decisions about spending cuts as they finalize budgets\nfor the next fiscal year.\nIn the longer term, governments will experience large revenue declines that are likely to\nlead to significant budget cuts for years to come. Likewise, the current crisis is likely to further\n\n8\n\n\fstress the funding of government pension plans, as contributions will likely come under pressure\nand investment returns decline sharply. Even as some economic indicators are starting to\nimprove, evidence from previous recessions suggests that the economic effects of the\ncoronavirus shock on state and local governments may take some time to fully materialize and\nmay persist even as health risks dissipate. 7\n\nOUTLOOK FOR POLICY\nHow does this economic outlook shape my views on the appropriate stance of monetary\npolicy? One thing to note is that determining the correct path for policy is likely to be even more\ndifficult than usual given what I expect to be the continued volatility of the incoming data.\nIndicators are expected to improve in the third quarter even as the level of activity remains\ndepressed. Overall, it might be awhile before the dust settles and we gain insight on whether\nfurther accommodation is necessary or not.\nAs the economy’s reopening progresses, we should get more clarity about the impact of\nthe actions we’ve taken, as well as the impact of fiscal stimulus. I am also realistic that the\nextraordinary uncertainty about the path of the pandemic over the second half of the year and the\neconomic outlook will require a fair amount of patience and wisdom as we navigate the likely\nlong-lasting implications of the coronavirus shock.\n\nSee Alison Felix, 2020. \"COVID-19 Challenges State and Local Government Finances.\" Economic Bulletin, Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, May 13.\n7\n\n9\n\n\f"

            "content": "Perspectives on Balance Sheet and Credit Policies:\nA Tribute to Marvin Goodfriend\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMarch 6, 2020\nThe Shadow Open Market Committee\nNew York, N.Y.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fI appreciate this opportunity to pay tribute to Marvin Goodfriend and his many\ncontributions to the theory and practice of monetary policy. 1 At the Kansas City Fed, we knew\nMarvin as a scholar and a good Federal Reserve colleague. Marvin also was a participant in a\nnumber of our Jackson Hole Economic Symposiums. As a Research Officer at the Richmond\nFed, he attended the first symposium that we held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in 1982, where his\nwork on “Discount Window Borrowing, Monetary Control, and the Post-October 6, 1979\nFederal Reserve Operating Procedures” was widely cited. 2 Thirty-four years later in 2016, as a\nprofessor at Carnegie Mellon, he presented a paper making the case for deeply negative interest\nrates as a policy tool that could breach the zero lower bound on nominal rates. He argued that\n“the zero interest bound encumbrance on monetary policy should be removed so that movements\nin the intertemporal terms of trade can be reflected fully in interest rate policy to sustain price\nstability and full employment with a minimum of inefficient and costly alternative policies\n[emphasis added].” 3\nWilling to challenge conventional views, Marvin expressed concern that “central banks\n[would] be tempted to rely even more heavily on balance sheet policy in lieu of interest rate\npolicy, in effect exerting stimulus by fiscal policy means via distortionary credit allocation, the\nassumption of credit risk and maturity transformation, all taking risks on behalf of taxpayers and\nall moving central banks ever closer to destructive inflationary finance.” He understood the\nassociated heartburn of this view, acknowledging that negative interest rates was an idea that\nwould likely require “some getting used to.” He noted, however, that the public also was initially\n\nI thank Kansas City Fed Vice President and Economist George Kahn for his assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLater published in the Journal of Monetary Economics, September 1983, pp. 343-56.\n3\nMarvin Goodfriend, “The Case for Unencumbering Interest Rate Policy at the Zero Lower Bound,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, 2016, pp. 127-160.\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016goodfriend.pdf?la=en\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n\fresistant to leaving the gold standard, and later to floating the exchange rate, but gradually\naccepted these changes.\nWhile the use of negative interest rates gives me pause as a way to address a future\nencounter with the effective lower bound, I share Marvin’s concerns about the potential side\neffects of balance sheet policies that pose risks to financial stability and threaten the central\nbank’s policy independence.\nAs a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2013, I\nexpressed my concerns about the continuation of the asset purchase program known popularly as\nQE3. By then, financial markets were stable and the economy was growing. These concerns\nabout the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet under those conditions echoed many of Marvin’s\nconcerns. In my view, the possible unintended side effects of the ongoing asset purchases posed\nrisks to economic and financial stability and served to unnecessarily further complicate future\nmonetary policy. 4 Today, however, it is conventional wisdom that the benefits of asset purchases\nhave been clearly established and that their potential costs have proven negligible. History and\nfurther research may ultimately affirm that wisdom, but it remains less than clear to me that the\nlonger-run costs of balance sheet policies have been fully taken into account.\nAs a consequence of large-scale asset purchases, for example, the FOMC had to evaluate\nand reconsider its longstanding operating framework. Given the abundant reserves associated\nwith its balance sheet policies, the FOMC had to consider whether the federal funds rate target\ncould be achieved administratively by setting the interest rate on excess reserves. Indeed, to\nensure effective interest rate control and establish a firm floor on overnight rates, an overnight\n\nEsther George, “Fed Balance Sheet 101,” Remarks to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Forum,\nDenver, Colorado, July 2017. https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/speeches/2017/2017-georgedenver-07-12.pdf\n4\n\n2\n\n\freverse repo facility was created. In addition, as the Fed began to shrink its balance sheet, it\nproved challenging to gauge the minimum reserve balances needed for achieving the federal\nfunds rate target without intervention by the open market desk at the New York Fed. As a result,\nthe desk resumed regularly conducting repo operations and outright purchases of Treasuries to\nbuild a bigger buffer and ensure an ample supply of reserves. These operations have caused some\nconfusion in markets as some participants have seen them—incorrectly, in my view—as a type\nof quantitative easing.\nMore generally, to the extent that large-scale asset purchases succeeded in their aim of\ncreating a wealth effect, they also played some role in contributing to elevated asset valuations.\nThese effects, together with the perception that interest rates will remain at historically low\nlevels for a prolonged period, can lead to a buildup of financial imbalances that ultimately pose\nrisks to the real economy. Experience has shown that these imbalances can develop in sectors\noutside the lens of regulators and, as we witnessed a decade ago, can unwind with little warning.\nAnother concern I share with Marvin is the risk that income from the Fed’s large balance\nsheet combined with our capital surplus could tempt fiscal authorities to view the Fed as a source\nof funding for government programs. I would argue that we have seen a degree of this risk\nunfold. The funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), as required under the\nDodd-Frank Act, is a case in point. Each quarter the Reserve Banks transfer to the CFPB,\nwithout Congressional appropriations, the amount of funds requested by the Director of the\nCFPB to carry out its operations. To date, the Federal Reserve has transferred almost $4.4 billion\nto the CFPB. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Fed to fund the first two years of the\nOffice of Financial Research in support of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).\n\n3\n\n\fYet another example of congressional funding of programs outside the regular\nappropriations process is the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act.” In the\nFAST Act, Congress funded highway construction by reducing the Federal Reserve Bank stock\ndividend rate for member banks with assets of more than $10 billion. The Act also placed a cap\nof $10 billion on the aggregate surplus funds of the Federal Reserve and directed that any excess\nbe transferred to the Treasury general fund. The potential policy implications of modifying\ndividends to member banks, or more generally, the requirement for member banks to purchase\nstock in a regional Federal Reserve Bank, is a concerning development that risks undermining\nthe Federal Reserve’s long-standing institutional design of public and private interests serving\nthe American public. 5\nTo ensure the central bank maintains surplus capital against prospective exposures on a\nbalance sheet inflated by large scale asset purchases, Marvin argued that the central bank must\nhave independent authority to retain its net interest earnings to build surplus capital. Without\nsuch capital, the “carry trade” exposure from the balance sheet would “[jeopardize] the\noperational credibility of monetary policy for price stability.” 6\nFinally, Marvin was adamant that central bank independence was essential for the\ncredibility and effectiveness of monetary policy. In testimony before Congress, Marvin said:\n“Flexibility and decisiveness are essential for effective central banking. Independence\nenables a central bank to react promptly to macroeconomic or financial shocks without\nthe approval of the Treasury or legislature. Central bank initiatives must be regarded as\n\nEsther L. George, “Structure, Governance, Representation: Federal Reserve Member Banks and Federal Reserve\nBank Stock,” July 2016. https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/speeches/2016/structure-governancerepresentation.pdf\n6\nMarvin Goodfriend, “Monetary Policy as a Carry Trade,” IMES Discussion Paper Series No. 2014-E-8, Bank of\nJapan, September 2014.\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/596b/3815fb45d8fd6fd7b7c1b4a2fc6dacb0b04d.pdf?_ga=2.188435944.190354274\n6.1581107605-2138291141.1581107605\n5\n\n4\n\n\flegitimate by the legislature and the public, otherwise such initiatives will lack credibility\nessential for their effectiveness.” 7\nFurthermore, to maintain independence, policymakers must draw a bright line between monetary\nand fiscal policy actions. He said:\n“The problem is to identify the limits of independence on monetary policy and credit\npolicy to preserve a workable, sustainable division of responsibilities between the central\nbank and the fiscal authorities—the legislature and Treasury.” 8\nArguably, this bright line faded in November 2008 when the Federal Reserve announced\nits first round of large-scale asset purchases consisting of $100 billion of agency debt securities\nand $500 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). This program was expanded in\nMarch 2009 with the planned purchase of a total of $1.25 trillion in MBS, $200 billion in agency\ndebt, along with $300 billion in longer-term Treasury securities. Additional “open-ended”\npurchases of MBS were announced under the third round of LSAPs in September 2012. Today\nthe Federal Reserve holds almost $1.4 billion in MBS on its balance sheet, and the FOMC has\nindicated that it currently does not anticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities as part\nof its policy normalization process. These holdings arguably blur the line between monetary\npolicy and credit allocation.\nTo address this important distinction, Marvin proposed that the 1951 Treasury-Federal\nReserve Accord on monetary policy be supplemented with a Treasury-Fed Accord on credit\npolicy. He identified three key principles: First, as a long-run matter, a significant, sustained\ndeparture from a “Treasuries only” asset acquisition policy is incompatible with Fed\n\n7\nMarvin Goodfriend, “The Case for a Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord for Credit Policy,” Testimony before the\nSubcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade of the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of\nRepresentatives, Washington, D.C. March 2014.\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/896e/65a69106282deb5806c03da136c026d42176.pdf\n8\nIbid.\n\n5\n\n\findependence. Second, the Fed should adhere to “Treasuries only” except for occasional,\ntemporary, well-collateralized ordinary last-resort lending to solvent, supervised depository\ninstitutions. And third, Fed credit initiatives beyond ordinary last-resort lending should be\nundertaken only with prior agreement of the fiscal authorities, and only as bridge loans\naccompanied by take-outs arranged and guaranteed in advance by the fiscal authorities.\nThese principles are worth considering as the Federal Reserve contemplates its next\nencounter with the zero lower bound. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing review of its monetary\npolicy strategy, tools, and communications necessarily has surfaced a number of possible\napproaches to address such a future encounter. Among the possibilities are things we have tried\nin the past, such as asset purchases and forward guidance. Other ideas have been more novel,\nsuch as average inflation targeting, yield curve control and, yes, even negative interest rates.\nMarvin may be right that these things, particularly when they are controversial, take some\ngetting used to. But as importantly, he was keenly focused on preserving the central bank’s\nintegrity and independence at the same time. That perspective undoubtedly would serve us well\ntoday.\n\n6\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFebruary 10, 2020\nThe Volcker Alliance Roundtable\nWashington, D.C.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fTechnology and innovation have a long history of joining forces to disrupt existing\nconventions. We certainly see this dynamic playing out in today’s financial system as it relates to\nhow we think about money and its role in facilitating payments. While digital currencies—the\nsubject of this program—have modern features, the public policy questions associated with\nprivately issued currencies are familiar ones in a historical context.\nWell before the Federal Reserve’s creation in 1913, the United States had already been\nthrough multiple periods of what might be considered “financial experimentation.” In the early\n1800s, a time when our nation’s western boundary barely reached the Mississippi River,\nhundreds of commercial banks were issuing their own unique currencies. 1 This era of wildcat\nbanking prevailed for nearly three full decades with banks issuing even more poorly backed and\nsuspect currency. In this period, currency values could fluctuate wildly and created an\nimpediment to commerce for both sides of a transaction; the good or service being purchased as\nwell as the currency used in payment could be vulnerable to negotiation.\nStill, the motivation for creating many of these early private currencies was in response to\ndemand from a population seeking access to a medium of exchange that would improve the flow\nof commerce. In fact, the demand for private money remained in place even after the founding of\nthe Federal Reserve, as national bank notes and Federal Reserve notes co-existed in circulation\nfor several decades. This experience was true in other countries as well.\nToday’s landscape is different in many respects from the wildcat era. But the questions\nfacing policymakers strike me as having similar refrains.\n\nClark M. St. Clair and Hall, D.A. eds. “Documentary History of the Bank of the United States.” Gales and Seaton,\n1832. P. 632. Note that these remarks were made around 1816.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\fIn my remarks this afternoon, I’ll highlight the features of the current payments landscape\nthat drive the private sector’s digital currency solutions. This landscape also is prompting central\nbanks to respond, and in this regard, I’ll talk about the Federal Reserve’s approach.\nThis is a good time to remind you that the views I express here are my own, and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Problems are Digital Currencies Trying to Solve?\nNew privately issued digital currencies seek to bring money into the digital world with\nimprovements in speed and cost, and with the scale and scope to provide broad access. The\nability to send money with the speed and convenience of an email message is appealing and\nunderstandably gaining rapid adoption.\nFirst, let’s discuss speed. The Federal Reserve has heard from the industry for a number\nof years that payments need to be faster. However, one of the reasons processes have not been\nupdated is that the underlying infrastructure is not designed to be instantaneous. As a result, it\ncan take up to a few days for someone to receive funds in a personal account, regardless as to\nwhether the payment was by check, ACH, card, or one of the increasingly popular payment apps.\nThis can be especially problematic for many Americans who are living paycheck-to-paycheck. It\nalso matters to small businesses and their ability to manage cash flow.\nThe cost of payments is another pain point that is potentially amplified by multiple\nintermediaries in a payments transaction. For example, some providers of digital currencies\nhighlight what they view as excessive interchange fees—an issue we at the Kansas City Fed have\nbeen studying for more than 15 years—as a reason that merchants may be interested in adopting\n\n2\n\n\fthis new medium of exchange over current systems. 2 According to a 2019 Nilson Report, U.S.\nmerchants collectively paid fees of $108 billion to accept credit, debit, and prepaid cards in\n2018. 3 The majority of these were interchange fees.\nThe reach of payment capabilities also is an important aspect of today’s landscape.\nGlobalization has led to an increase in cross-border payments. Yet because infrastructure,\ncurrency, standards, laws and regulations are domestic and not international, there are many\nefficiency and coordination challenges with cross-border payments. As a result, the location and\njurisdiction of payment participants matters, and raises the question of whether digital currencies\ncan address these challenges.\nFinally, digital currencies have been touted as better facilitating access to the financial\nsystem for the unbanked population. This is an issue that brings to mind that paper currencies in\nColonial America were developed as something of a proxy for the gold or silver that the British\nlargely kept out of the colonies. Colonists, unable to access the specie used for commerce in\nmuch of the rest of the developed world, began to develop their own rudimentary system. In it\nwere bills that could be redeemed for some amount of another item—for example, the\nContinental Congress issued bills that could be redeemed for Spanish dollars. For colonists, this\nwas one way—although perhaps not the best or most efficient way—of addressing issues of\naccess.\nAccording to the World Bank, 1.7 billion people still do not have access to useful and\naffordable financial products and services. As commerce and payments have become more\n\nSee, for example, Hayashi, F. (2004) “A Puzzle of Card Payment Pricing: Why Are Merchants Still Accepting\nCard Payments?” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Payments System Research Working Paper, WP 04-02. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City hosted an international payments policy conference entitled “Interchange Fees\nin Credit and Debit Card Markets: What Role for Public Authorities?” in 2005.\n3\nNilson Report, Issue 1155, June 2019.\n2\n\n3\n\n\fdigitalized, those who rely solely on physical cash for transactions may run the risk of limiting\nthe transactions they can conduct.\n\nWhat are the Problems Associated with these Innovations?\nEach of these are legitimate problems that digital currencies seem well suited to address.\nYet we can’t overlook that despite efforts to make payments faster, less costly, and broadly\naccessible, today’s privately issued digital currencies operate largely outside our existing\ninstitutional and regulatory frameworks. This raises important questions for policymakers. I\nwould highlight three potential problems related in particular to central bank objectives: the role\nof the banking system, the implications for monetary policy, and the risks to financial stability.\nDigital currencies and other private nonbank financial innovations challenge the notion of\nthe traditional bank business model. Our institutional frameworks have for some time regarded\ncommercial banks as foundational, even special, to our financial system in three particular\naspects. 4 First, no other type of financial company and its funding has access to the public safety\nnet of federal deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve’s discount window. Second, banks are\nregulated and supervised because of this safety net and their key role in the economy. Indeed, the\nseparation of commercial banking from investment banking and commerce was an important part\nof the prudential regulatory structure for many years. Finally, only banks have direct access to\nthe Federal Reserve’s payments rails.\nNonbank financial companies are competing aggressively for these traditional banking\nfunctions. Lending platforms offered by nonbank entities allow households and businesses to\n\nCorrigan, E. Gerald, 1983. “Are Banks Special?” Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 1982 Annual Report.\nAvailable at http://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2012/01/Corrigan-Are-Banks-Special_main-text.pdf.\n\n4\n\n4\n\n\faccess credit, and nonbank payment services are growing rapidly. According to McKinsey data,\nglobal revenue in these services grew to $1.9 trillion in 2018.\nSome federal and state banking authorities have considered the use of special purpose\ncharters as a way to cast a regulatory frame around these new “fintech” activities. In 2018, the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency announced it would issue a fintech charter, only to\nface legal challenges. At the state level, legislation is beginning to accommodate digital currency\nactivities through special purpose depository institutions operating under new regulatory\nregimes. For example, the state of Wyoming has passed legislation that will allow these new\nspecial purpose depository institutions to apply for membership in the Federal Reserve System\nand to gain access to the payment system through a Federal Reserve Bank master account.\nThe adoption of private digital currencies at scale also has implications for monetary\npolicy. Should digital currencies lead to a large share of financial transactions taking place\noutside of the current system, then digital currencies may challenge current operating\nframeworks. For instance, the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy by engaging with a\nlimited number of primary dealers. This centralized framework could be challenged should a\ndecentralized medium of exchange develop which facilitates financial settlement outside of the\nmarkets in which primary dealers operate.\nIn addition, one of the most basic functions of the central bank is to supply liquidity in\ntimes of crisis. However, without a clearly defined set of counterparties, the benefit of this\nfunction could be limited. More generally, the proliferation of digital currencies may challenge\nthe ability of central banks to achieve their longer-run macroeconomic objectives to the extent it\nerodes the ability of monetary policy to influence broad financial conditions confronting\nhouseholds and businesses.\n\n5\n\n\fFinally, the stability of the financial system is foundational to the ability of central banks\nto achieve their objectives. Events that trigger a loss of confidence or incite a classic bank-like\nrun may not find remedies in the existing regulatory and policy toolkit, including the Federal\nReserve’s discount window.\n\nWhat are Central Banks Doing to Address These Problems?\nThe accelerating pace of change has implications for financial systems around the world\nand for the way central banks conduct their business to meet their objectives. To that end, the\nBank for International Settlements (BIS) has organized an Innovation Hub where global central\nbanks can collaborate and experiment. Additionally, more than 50 central banks are engaged in\ndigital currency work, according to the BIS. Countries like Sweden and Uruguay are evaluating\ndigital currency prototypes.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve has no plans to issue a digital currency, we are carefully\nmonitoring and studying global developments. A more immediate priority has been to modernize\nour own payment rails to meet the demand for reliable, real-time payments, as are other central\nbanks around the world.\nWe are currently developing a new retail payment service called FedNow to support\nwidespread adoption of faster payments in the United States. This service will operate alongside\na private sector service to provide real-time, payment-by-payment, settlement of interbank\nobligations through debits and credits to banks’ balances in accounts at the Reserve Banks while\nincorporating clearing functionality, thus allowing for end-to-end faster payments. We expect\nFedNow will be able to address the concerns that we’ve heard from the public about the need for\na real-time payments infrastructure.\n\n6\n\n\fOther central banks also are addressing the desire for speed. The Reserve Bank of\nAustralia developed its Fast Settlement Service, which “enables final and irrevocable settlement\nof individual New Payments Platform transactions in real time.” TARGET Instant Payment\nSettlement, commonly known as TIPS, was developed to reach retail participants in the\nEurozone. Additionally, modernization efforts are underway for countries with existing faster\npayment systems, such as the U.K.\nAs it relates to the costs of today’s payment system, central banks are responding in\ndifferent ways. Some countries allow central banks and other public authorities to directly\nregulate the payments system and often have the authority to regulate certain fees associated with\nmaking a payment. Central banks such as the Federal Reserve operate retail payment systems to\nachieve its objectives for efficiency, accessibility, and safety. Operating alongside the private\nsector in the delivery of retail payment services to some 10,000 financial institutions in the U.S.\nhas been judged by the Government Accountability Office in a 2016 report to promote\ninnovation and competition with benefits to the public. 5\nCentral banks also have begun to coordinate their efforts at an international level. For\nexample, this year’s Financial Stability Board (FSB) work program highlights how the FSB, in\ncoordination with the BIS’s Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure (CPMI), will\ncreate a roadmap for the G-20 to enhance global cross-border payments. As participants of both\nthe FSB and the CPMI, the Federal Reserve will be working with its international counterparts to\naddress some of the pain points with cross-border payments.\n\nSee: “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could\nIncrease Assurance of Cost Accuracy.” U.S. Government Accountability Office. August 30, 2016, at\nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-614 and “The Federal Reserve in the Payments Mechanism.” Federal\nReserve System. January 1998, at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/1998/19980105/19980105.pdf.\n5\n\n7\n\n\fFinally, access to financial services remains an important policy goal. This is an\nimportant consideration for the U.S. as well, although access to technology itself has been noted\nas a barrier with some 45 percent of unbanked households having neither a smartphone nor\ninternet access at home. This means almost half of the unbanked may not be able to use these\nnew payment solutions. Providing a foundational infrastructure such as broadband internet\nservice will be essential for this population. The Federal Reserve has viewed such investments\nfavorably for purposes of the Community Reinvestment Act.\n\nConclusion\nPayments digitalization, new entrants, and new business models will continue to disrupt\nand reshape the financial services industry. As I noted earlier, digital currencies may well have\nthe potential to address pain points in the current payments system. At the same time, however,\nwe should be mindful of lessons from the past.\nRealizing the benefits of these alternative solutions argues for careful consideration of the\nimportant safeguards that have fostered the public’s confidence in, and the safety of, the financial\nsystem. To that end, it is important for central banks and other policymakers to monitor closely\nthese emerging technologies and to assess potential implications to the banking industry, to\nfinancial stability, and to monetary policy, which are essential for securing the public’s trust and\nconfidence.\nI look forward to the insights that will come from this forum.\n\n8\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJanuary 14, 2020\nThe Central Exchange\nKansas City, Missouri\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fThank you and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. I’m pleased to\ncontinue this New Year’s tradition with the Central Exchange of offering my view of the\neconomic outlook for the coming year. 1\nBefore I do that, however, I want to take a few minutes to remember former Federal\nReserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who passed away last month. Certainly, others worked more\nclosely with Chairman Volcker than I did, and a number of wonderful tributes have been offered\nsince his passing. But in starting a new year and reflecting on the challenges facing the Federal\nReserve in 2020 and beyond, I was thinking about how much the nation and our institution in\nparticular owes to him. His leadership and public service also have been important to me\npersonally.\nI came to work for the Kansas City Fed in 1982. I was excited about my new job as a\nbank examiner and pleased with my $10,000 annual salary to help me pay for what at that time\nwas considered an affordable 12 percent fixed-rate mortgage. Paul Volcker was the Fed Chair\nwho signed my examiner credentials. In that role, I would learn that he paid close attention to\nthe health of the financial system, including small banks in this region. He understood well that\nhigh interest rates were taking their toll on the economy and especially in our region where\nagriculture, energy and real estate conditions resulted in hundreds of bank failures. He also\nunderstood that the long-run health of the economy and the public’s well-being depended on\nbreaking the back of high inflation. That took courage to endure short-term—but very real—\nsuffering for long-term benefits.\nAfter I became president of the Kansas City Fed in 2011, Paul Volcker took my calls and\nalways welcomed a visit to New York, willing to share his experience and advice with a new Fed\nI thank Kansas City Fed Vice President and Economist George Kahn and Senior Vice President Diane Raley for\ntheir assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\fpresident like me. He was a source of encouragement and inspiration. And even in New York\nCity, where they are proud of their “no-eye-contact-anonymity,” when you crossed the street\nwith Paul Volcker to go to his favorite restaurant, heads turned.\nHe spoke his mind and his views were well informed. Watch his blunt statements at\ncongressional hearings and other public events. Intellectual honesty, public service, and\nleadership were his hallmarks. And even if you didn’t agree with him, you knew where he stood\nand that his interest was in how best to serve the American public.\nFinally, the Kansas City Fed owes a debt of gratitude to Paul Volcker whose attendance\nwas essential to the 1982 launch of our fledging economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole,\nWyoming. In the years that followed, he remained accessible to us. In 2009, Paul came to\nKansas City, where he was awarded the Truman Medal for Economic Policy. He was willing to\nread our Bank’s proposals and papers and would offer his comments – sometimes criticism,\nsometimes support – but it was always helpful and welcomed insight.\nCertainly, I did not agree with him on every issue, but that is never the point. Leadership,\nintegrity, and service were at the core of his character, and it’s something to aspire to today. It\nwas an honor to have started my career under his leadership as Fed chair and to have engaged\nwith him during his post-Fed years. I am grateful for his mentorship.\nOf course, the economic environment that we face today is quite different than the one\nthat challenged Paul Volcker and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. That is\nperhaps a good segue to sharing my views on the challenges the Federal Reserve faces in 2020 as\nwe consider the economic landscape and our monetary policy settings.\nWhen I spoke to you last January, the economy looked to be in good shape in terms of\ngrowth with low unemployment and low inflation. At that time, the Federal Reserve had raised\n\n2\n\n\fits policy interest rate to a range of 2¼ to 2½ percent—a total of 225 basis points since the end of\n2015. The lengthy expansion seemed poised to continue with historically low unemployment\nand muted inflation, although sentiment began to sour and recession fears mounted in the face of\nslowing global growth and trade policy uncertainty. Given these downside risks, the Federal\nReserve reversed course last July and eased policy three times.\n\nOutlook for 2020\nAs we turn the page to a new year, many of the themes from 2019 seem likely to carry\nover to 2020. In particular, I continue to see the expansion supported by solid growth in\nconsumer spending with continued weakness in manufacturing and business spending. While a\nstrong labor market and rising incomes will support consumer spending, the underlying cause of\nweak business spending—sluggish global growth and ongoing trade tensions—will likely persist\nover the near term. The combination of these factors should lead to slower growth in real\nGDP—our broadest indicator of economic activity—to its longer-run trend of 1¾ to 2 percent.\nWith growth near trend, I would expect the unemployment rate to remain near its current level of\n3.5 percent and inflation to remain benign.\nBecause the consumer is critical to the ongoing expansion, monitoring a number of\nfundamental factors that drive consumer spending will be important this year. The good news is\nthat the consumer is entering the new year with considerable spending momentum. For example,\nhousehold consumption data was stronger than expected in the third quarter with spending on\ndurable and non-durable goods rising at a solid pace. While we don’t yet have official data on\n\n3\n\n\fconsumer spending for December, a report from MasterCard indicates a strong holiday shopping\nseason with record high e-commerce sales. 2\nOne reason to be optimistic that this momentum is sustainable is that residential\ninvestment appears to have responded to lower mortgage rates. Recent data indicate positive\ncontributions from most major housing indicators, as single-family construction and brokers’\ncommissions rebound. Forward-looking measures, such as single-family starts and permits,\ncontinue to move up strongly, suggesting the strength in residential investment growth will likely\ncontribute to growth in the medium term.\nAnother key factor to keep an eye on is the labor market. With the unemployment rate at\n3.5 percent, a robust labor market supported consumer spending in 2019 and should continue to\ndo so in 2020, even as payroll growth continues to slow in line with the economy’s potential.\nThe economy added on average 176,000 jobs per month through December of last year,\ncompared to 223,000 per month in 2018. In addition, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported\nthat the pace of job openings has slowed. 3\nWhile I project consumer spending to remain robust, some moderation from recent strong\ngrowth is to be expected for a number of reasons. First, as I just discussed, employment is likely\nto grow at a slower pace this year than last year. Second, while the consumption of goods has\nremained robust, the consumption of services, which represents a larger share of consumer\nspending, decelerated in the third quarter. Third, real retail sales data have leveled off since\nreaching a peak in August of last year, and imports of consumer goods and autos have slowed.\n\n2\n\nhttps://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/mastercard-spendingpulse-u-s-retail-salesgrew-3-4-percent-this-holiday-season/\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), job openings\ndeclined from 5.2% of total private nonfarm payroll employment plus job openings at the end of November 2018\n(the current cyclical high) to 4.8% of total private employment plus job openings at the end of October 2019.\n3\n\n4\n\n\fThe recent slowing in imports may reflect the effect of tariff increases that were imposed in\nSeptember and have fallen mostly on consumer goods. Finally, consumer spending could\nmoderate based on sentiment about the economic outlook. While confidence measures remain\nnear post-recession highs, expectations for the future bear watching. Based on the Conference\nBoard’s survey of consumer confidence, the differential between consumer expectations for the\nfuture and their assessment of current conditions has widened over the past several years. In the\npast, when confidence in future conditions has fallen relative to confidence in the present\nsituation, consumer spending has tended to slow. That will be something to keep on an eye on\nthis year.\nIn contrast to consumer spending, business spending has been relatively weak for some\ntime. The goods-producing sector, in particular, which includes manufacturing, mining, energy\nproduction and construction, has faced a range of challenges that has limited the pace of its\nexpansion. For example, U.S. tariffs on imports, retaliatory tariffs on our exports abroad, along\nwith weaker global growth and continued uncertainty surrounding trade policy, have created stiff\nheadwinds for manufacturers. Our manufacturing survey for the Kansas City Fed’s region shows\nthat activity has contracted in each of the past six months. In addition, the Institute for Supply\nManagement’s manufacturing survey indicates that national manufacturing activity moved into\ncontractionary territory in August. For the energy sector, oil prices declined 24 percent from\nOctober 2018 to October 2019, contributing to a slowing in drilling activity across most oilproducing regions. More recently, oil prices have rebounded somewhat, which may lead to some\nincrease in production going forward.\nSo on balance, the broad economy continues to grow with high levels of employment and\nlow inflation, while downside risks have lingered and strained key parts of the goods-producing\n\n5\n\n\fsector. This dichotomy presents a challenge for policymakers as we determine the appropriate\nstance for monetary policy under such conditions.\n\nChallenges for Monetary Policy\nLooking back at last year, I viewed monetary policy decisions in light of an economy that\nwas slowing, as expected, toward its trend rate of growth due in large part to the ebbing of fiscal\nstimulus and the shift to higher interest rates. But I also recognized that slower global growth\nabroad and trade policy uncertainty posed downside risks to the outlook. Even so, I did not\nsupport the three outright cuts in the target federal funds rate starting in July because I preferred\nto wait for clearer evidence that the headwinds from global developments were threatening to\nderail the ongoing economic expansion. I supported the decision in December to hold rates\nsteady as a prudent move while we assess a number of factors going into this year.\nWith an economy growing at or above potential, a strong labor market, and low and\nstable inflation, policymakers will need time to judge the proper stance of policy. We will need\nto assess whether the 2019 rate cuts prove to be “insurance cuts” that will need to be reversed if\nheadwinds fade. On the other hand, the 2019 rate cuts may turn out to be a reset to a more\nneutral policy stance, recognizing that the equilibrium federal funds rate may be lower than\npreviously assumed. Finally, it could be the case that downside risks and uncertainties persist in\na way that keeps investment spending weak and spills over to the consumer, altering the modal\noutlook and requiring further policy easing.\nOver the longer run, a key concern is the capacity of monetary policy to address a future\neconomic downturn should it arise. One reason for this concern is that the federal funds rate is\nhistorically low, leaving little policy space to deal with a future recession. In a typical recession,\n\n6\n\n\fthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has reduced the federal funds rate target by 5 to 6\npercentage points. With the funds rate target currently at 1½ to 1¾ percent, the Fed has less than\nhalf the policy space available relative to the past before hitting the zero lower bound on rates.\nThis is not just a concern for U.S. policymakers. Interest rates are at historically low\nlevels in a number of advanced economies, including the euro area, Japan, Canada, and the UK.\nIn fact, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, as well as a number of other central\nbanks, have set their policy rates below zero.\nCentral banks also have expressed concern that inflation has run persistently below their\ntargets. In the United States, both headline and core inflation as measured by the personal\nconsumption expenditure price index have remained muted since the Fed announced its 2 percent\ninflation objective in 2012. The fact that this, too, is a global issue affecting both Japan and the\neuro area, raises the possibility that global structural factors outside the control of policymakers\nare driving inflation dynamics.\nIn the United States, persistently low inflation has been unusual in light of historically\ntight labor markets. This has led policymakers to mark down their estimates of the natural rate\nof unemployment—the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation. These estimates of\nthe natural rate have come down from over 5 percent in 2013 to a median of 4.1 percent in\nDecember 2019. 4 Even with this lowering of estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, the\nactual unemployment rate still remains below the natural rate. In the past, this situation would\nhave typically put upward pressure on inflation. So it raises questions about the accuracy of\nestimates of the natural rate as well as about the relationship between inflation and slack in labor\nmarkets.\nBased on the central tendency of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for the longer-run\nunemployment rate reported in 2013 and the median projection of the SEP reported in December 2019.\n\n4\n\n7\n\n\fThis weakening of the relationship between inflation and labor market slack perplexes\ncentral banks, making it very difficult to credibly achieve their inflation targets by pushing the\nunemployment rate down. Even if such a policy were successful it might entail a further,\nsignificant tightening of the labor market, leading to a misallocation of labor resources and a\nbuildup of financial imbalances.\nGiven these concerns, the Federal Reserve is engaging in a review of its monetary policy\nstrategy, tools, and communications. The review has several parts, including a series of Fed\nListens events around the country designed to help policymakers better understand the\nperspectives of people from diverse backgrounds and with varied interests. The Kansas City Fed\nhosted one such event in October. The Federal Open Market Committee also is devoting time at\na series of its regular meetings to assess lessons learned in the aftermath of the Great Recession\nand to consider how monetary policy can best serve the public, including possible enhancements\nor changes to its monetary policy framework that would help the Federal Reserve meet its\nstatutory objectives for employment and price stability—especially in the event of a future\ndownturn in economic activity. Fed Chair Jay Powell has indicated that the FOMC will publicly\nreport the conclusions of its discussions, likely during the first half of this year.\n\nConclusion\nThe U.S. economy is currently doing well, with real GDP growth near trend,\nunemployment near record lows, and inflation low and stable. While business spending is in a\nsoft spot, household spending has remained robust. Keeping rates on hold for now is appropriate\nin my view as we assess the economy’s response to last year’s rate cuts and monitor incoming\ndata.\n\n8\n\n\fFor the longer run, the Federal Reserve will be reevaluating its monetary policy\nstrategies, tools, and communications to address future downturns in a low interest rate economy.\nWith limited policy space between our current federal funds rate target and the zero lower bound\non nominal interest rates, policymakers are likely to find themselves looking deep into the policy\ntoolkit to fight future recessionary shocks. Clearly explaining the Federal Reserve’s monetary\npolicy strategies and longer-run goals will be essential to the institution’s credibility and to the\npublic’s trust and confidence.\n\n9\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 18, 2019\nEnergy and the Economy: Markets in Transition\nA Joint Conference of the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas\nDenver, Colorado\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fI’m pleased to welcome you to the fourth annual energy conference hosted by the Federal\nReserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas. Energy is a key sector of our regional economies.\nTaken together, our two regions account for more than 50 percent of U.S. oil production and an\neven larger share of the headquarters of U.S. exploration and production companies, including\nseveral right here in Denver.\nThe title and theme of this year’s conference is “Energy and the Economy: Markets in\nTransition.” As the title suggests, there are several notable transitions that we will consider and\ndiscuss today.\nWe will look first at the transitions underway as global oil markets calibrate the dynamics\nof rising U.S. production amid signs of slowing global economic growth. The Kansas City Fed’s\nthird quarter energy survey released last Friday showed that new drilling in our region has\nslowed further and firms anticipate more deterioration in coming months, so we are keeping a\nparticularly watchful eye on the sector at the moment.\nWe will also discuss the energy transition occurring in the U.S. power utility sector\ndriven by abundant, inexpensive natural gas and rapid growth in renewable energy generation.\nWithin the Kansas City Federal Reserve District alone, renewables’ share of electric power\ngeneration capacity has grown from less than 10 percent a decade ago to more than 25 percent in\n2019. At the same time, our region produces more coal — the primary fuel being replaced in\npower generation — than any other Federal Reserve District. So understanding more about how\nthis transition is evolving is vital for understanding economic trends across our region.\nFinally, we will explore transitions in energy finance, with an eye toward the factors that\nare influencing investment and risk management within the oil and gas, and the renewable\nenergy industries. Understanding how transitions in the broader energy sector could affect\n\n2\n\n\ffinancial institutions both large and small across our region is an important aspect of the Federal\nReserve’s role as a bank supervisor and regulator.\nTo help guide us through each of these topics, we have a distinguished set of speakers\nand panelists with considerable expertise and experience from both the private and public\nsectors. I look forward to their comments and your participation in discussing these themes.\nAs energy markets experience transitions, they do so in the context of changing dynamics\nin the broader economy. My remarks today will highlight the challenges that monetary\npolicymakers face in reading and understanding these transitions while determining the\nappropriate setting for policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price\nstability.\nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views and are not\nintended to represent the views of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTHE U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\nLooking across most of our economic measures, the U.S. economy is generally\nperforming well. We are now in the 11th year of the current expansion, and the economy has, by\nmost accounts, achieved full employment and stable prices. The unemployment rate is currently\n3.5 percent, which is the lowest level on record in the past 50 years. And inflation, which\nhistorically has moved higher as the labor market strengthens, has remained low and stable.\nWith respect to the overall growth rate of the economy, 2019 has been a transition year.\nAs expected, the pace of economic growth has decelerated to a level more consistent with the\nlonger-run trend growth rate of the economy following two years of strong growth in 2017 and\n2018. This transition was expected in part due to the tightness of the labor market. When an\neconomy approaches its full-employment level, the lack of available workers, particularly skilled\n3\n\n\fworkers, naturally limits the pace at which business activity can expand. The latest reading from\nthe National Federation of Independent Businesses survey confirms this dynamic. The percent of\nsurvey respondents that cited finding qualified workers as their No. 1 problem hit a 46-year\nrecord high in July.\nThe transition from faster growth last year to a more moderate pace in 2019 also is\nrelated to fiscal policy. The economy received a boost to aggregate demand from stimulus in\n2018 in the form of a tax cut to businesses and households in addition to increased government\nspending. This stimulus produced a transitory boost to growth that was expected to eventually\nfade in 2019 and 2020.\nUnder these conditions, we have seen the pace of growth decelerate from a strong annual\nrate near 3 percent toward a pace of growth closer to 2 percent. Looking forward, I expect\ngrowth to slow a bit further over the medium term as it approaches the economy’s longer-run\ngrowth rate, which I view as just under 2 percent.\nWhile the aggregate economic growth picture has unfolded largely as expected in 2019,\nthere are important developments in play across broad sectors of the economy. A clear\ndichotomy is emerging between the services sector1, which is supported by strong consumption\ngrowth, and the goods-producing sector, which is facing a range of economic crosscurrents.\nAcross both of these sectors, the primary driver for economic growth in the U.S. is the consumer.\nThe strong labor market with high levels of employment and upward pressure on wages has\nprovided the fuel to support solid consumption growth and contribute to a high level of consumer\nconfidence. Strong consumer momentum, which is also supported by an overall personal savings\n\n1\n\nService-providing industries tied closely to the consumer include education and health services, leisure\nand hospitality, information, finance, and wholesale and retail trade.\n\n4\n\n\frate that remains at a stable and relatively high level, has been the key underpinning of my\noutlook for continued economic expansion over the medium term.\nThe goods-producing sector, which includes manufacturing, mining, energy production\nand construction, has, on the other hand, faced a range of challenges that has limited its pace of\nexpansion. For example, an expansion of U.S. tariffs on imports, retaliatory tariffs on our exports\nabroad, along with weaker global growth and continued uncertainty surrounding trade policy\nhave created stiff headwinds for manufacturers. Our manufacturing survey for the region shows\nthat activity has contracted in each of the past three months, and the national ISM survey\nindicates that manufacturing activity for the nation also moved into contractionary territory in\nAugust. For the energy sector, oil prices are down about 20 percent from a year ago, contributing\nto a slowing in drilling activity across most oil-producing regions in the country. And in the\nhousing sector, although forward-looking indicators have improved recently, rising mortgage\nrates in 2018 and the first half of 2019 coupled with rising housing prices contributed to a\ndecline in home sales and six consecutive quarters of declining residential investment.\nSo on balance, while the broad economy continues to grow with high levels of\nemployment and low inflation, downside risks are prominent and have strained key parts of the\ngoods-producing sector. This dichotomy presents a challenge for policymakers as they determine\nthe appropriate stance for monetary policy under such conditions.\n\nDATA DEPENDENCE VERSUS RISK MANAGEMENT\nAs policymakers confront this challenge, policy choices can become more difficult.\nEasing policy may be viewed as a proactive step to ward off weakness in a particular sector in\nthe attempt to prevent that weakness from spreading to broader parts of the economy. Another\n\n5\n\n\fapproach would be to closely monitor the sectoral weakness, but wait until signs emerge of a\nbroader slowdown in activity before taking action. To better illustrate this challenge, I’ll talk\nabout these different approaches to policy setting using two frequently cited descriptions: a datadependent approach and a risk-management approach. I’ll argue that both elements are important\nto monetary policy decisions.\nFederal Reserve policymakers began using the phrase “data dependent” in 2012 to\ndescribe their approach to policy making. The phrase was intended to convey that policymakers\ncould not credibly commit to specific actions at specific dates in the future, but instead, their\nview of the appropriate setting of interest rates would evolve based on new data received. Such\nan approach could be misread as suggesting a “data-dependent” policymaker is solely influenced\nby the most recent data release, basing his or her decision on the arrival of new data rather than a\nmodal outlook for the economy.\n“Data-dependent” policy decisions in my view actually encompass a much broader and\nmulti-faceted process in which the data represent just one element. The foundation for the\ndecision-making process is a collection of information that includes not only incoming data, but\nalso the perspectives from my District contacts. Their anecdotes provide timely information that\nis not likely to appear in the data for several weeks or months given the inherent delays in\nreporting and revision of data statistics.\nWith this information in hand, judgments are required to determine how this broad\ninformation updates the economic outlook for the near and medium term. Given the long and\nvariable lags in the time it takes for monetary policy decisions to transmit to the broader\neconomy, one’s outlook for key variables such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and\ninflation are central to determining the appropriate policy action for today. So when I refer to a\n\n6\n\n\f“data-dependent” approach for policymaking, it is this broader approach that I have in mind\nrather than a short-term reaction to the most recent data point.\nA second commonly cited approach to policymaking is “risk management.” This\napproach is not necessarily distinct from a “data-dependent” approach. Rather than focusing on\none’s view of the data and the mostly likely, or modal, view for the outlook, a risk-management\napproach seeks to assess the range of risks and then determine the policy action that best\npositions the economy to weather those risks.\nIn the current context, while one’s modal outlook for the economy may be consistent\nwith the FOMC’s dual mandate, downside risks may represent alternative scenarios with\nundesirable outcomes for economic growth and stability. One such current risk is associated with\nthe ongoing trade policy uncertainty. Key questions relevant for policymakers as they assess this\nrisk would include: How have developments in trade policy impacted the economy since the start\nof 2018? How will trade policy decisions going forward influence the outlook? What role is\ntrade policy uncertainty having on the decisions of businesses and consumers? Is monetary\npolicy an effective tool to mitigate risks that may emanate from trade policy uncertainty?\nAssessment of the range of risks facing the economy, which expand far beyond trade\npolicy uncertainty, along with judgments of the possible economic implications should any of\nthose risks transpire, may justify policy action as insurance. In such a circumstance, it may be the\ncase that the overall economy is growing at an above-trend rate and the modal outlook is in line\nwith our dual mandate objectives. But the emergence of downside risks could be viewed as\nsufficiently threatening to warrant an adjustment in policy while those risks persist.\nA recent example of this type of situation occurred in 2014 and 2015 when the economy\nfaced several shocks that impacted a few industries at a time while the overall economy was\n\n7\n\n\fexpanding at a solid pace. During this period, the price of oil fell by more than 50 percent, the\ndollar appreciated by approximately 20 percent, and agricultural commodity prices such as corn\nand soybeans fell by more than 25 percent. These shifts in prices contributed to a downturn in the\nenergy, agricultural, and manufacturing sectors and represented downside risks for the broader\neconomy.\nIn this instance, the FOMC did not choose to directly provide additional accommodation\nto the economy, but instead communicated a shift in its view of the appropriate path for policy\ngoing forward. Using the median of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) as a\nreference point, the projection for the appropriate setting of policy at the end of 2016 was\nlowered by nearly a full percentage point from the March 2014 projection to the December 2015\nprojection. This adjustment provided appropriate support for the broader economy at a time\nwhen some sectors were experiencing weakness. And as the impact of those shocks dissipated\nover time, the FOMC then implemented the projected policy adjustments that had been delayed.\nDuring this period, the broader economy continued to expand with real GDP growth remaining\nabove trend and average employment growth in excess of 200,000 new jobs per month.\nOne challenge with this type of risk-management approach to policy setting is that while\nthe benefits of taking out insurance may be clear, the costs are not. One potential cost is that such\nan insurance policy risks overheating the sectors of the economy that are already performing\nwell. This can lead to a misallocation of resources toward those interest rate-sensitive sectors at\nthe expense of sectors that may be better positioned for growth over the longer run. A second\npotential cost stems from the fact that an easing in monetary policy is designed to encourage\nrisk-taking and leverage. In the earlier periods of an economic expansion, risks associated with\nincreasing leverage may be moderate, and as such the cost of extra insurance may be low. But\n\n8\n\n\fthese costs move higher as the economic expansion matures and as levels of corporate debt and\nother vulnerabilities become elevated.\n\nMONETARY POLICY\nTurning to the current monetary policy settings, data dependence and risk management\ncontinue to provide important strategy foundations for policymakers. In 2018, as the economic\nexpansion continued and the unemployment rate moved below most estimates of its long-run\nlevel, the FOMC continued to gradually remove accommodation and the federal funds rate\nmoved closer to estimates of its longer-run level. At the start of 2019 with an outlook for\neconomic growth to decelerate toward its longer-run trend growth rate, downside risks had\nemerged and the Committee announced that it would be patient as it determined what future\nadjustments would be appropriate. Then at its July and September meetings, the Committee\ntwice lowered the federal funds rates, citing implications of global developments for the\neconomic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures.\nI dissented from the recent decisions to ease policy based on my view of the outlook as it\nrelates to the Committee’s objectives for price stability and maximum employment. From a datadependence perspective, the moderation of economic growth in 2019 has been for the most part\nin line with my outlook, in which I expect growth to gradually decline toward its longer-run\ntrend level over the medium term. The combination of record-low unemployment, moderate\ngrowth, and low and stable inflation with an unchanged outlook led me to conclude that an\nunchanged setting for the federal funds target range remained appropriate.\nSupporting an unchanged policy rate in recent meetings does not ignore the downside\nrisks facing our economy. The emergence of those key risks to the outlook as early as the fourth\n\n9\n\n\fquarter of 2018 caused me to moderate my expectation that further rate increases were needed.\nSimilar to the experience from the 2014-15 period that I described earlier, I shifted downward\nmy view of the appropriate path for policy over the next one to two years in light of the\ndownside risks that have emerged over the past year and the implications of those risks for\ncertain sectors of the economy. I view this as an appropriate adjustment that is consistent with\nboth data-dependent and risk-management strategies.\nWhile some may view the cost of a reduction in rates as benign given that inflation\nremains somewhat below our 2 percent longer-run target, I am mindful that rate reductions are\nintended to boost demand and encourage risk-taking and leverage. The ability of the Federal\nReserve to offset any unintended effects related to financial stability at this stage of the business\ncycle seems limited. In the most recent Financial Stability Report issued by the Federal Reserve\nBoard in May, assessments for overall vulnerabilities were mostly sanguine. But the report also\nnoted that “elevated business debt, easy lending standards, and strong risk appetite pose a\nvulnerability… that potentially increases the downside risk to broader economic activity.” As\ncorporate debt continues to rise to high levels with the fastest growth among the riskiest firms,\nthe largest banks also are lowering their loss-absorbing capital levels. I view this combination of\nrisks as potentially costly to employment and growth, especially at this stage of the expansion.\nLooking forward, I will remain attentive to the incoming data for signs that downside\nrisks to the outlook materialize in a way that meaningfully affects broad economic conditions.\nUnder those circumstances, I would be prepared to adjust monetary policy accordingly.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n10\n\n\fConsumers continue to drive momentum for economic expansion in the face of downside\nrisks that over the past year have slowed activity in several key sectors. In these circumstances,\nboth data-dependent and risk-management strategies guide policymakers as they consider\nmonetary policy settings. My own outlook for the economy does not call for a monetary policy\nresponse. While weakness in manufacturing and business investment is evident, it is not clear\nthat monetary policy is the appropriate tool to offset the risks faced by businesses in those sectors\nwhen weighted against the costs that could be associated with such action. Should downside\nrisks spill over into the broader economy in a way that fundamentally affects the consumer and\nshifts the overall outlook, a monetary policy response may be required.\n\n11\n\n\f"

            "content": "Building for the Future: A Public Policy Perspective\n\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 15, 2019\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago Payments Symposium\nChicago, Ill.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fI appreciate the opportunity to join you today and want to thank Ellen Bromagen and the\nChicago Fed team for organizing this important conference. I look forward to the insights that\nwill come from this year’s program and its participants.\nToday’s theme of innovation recognizes that the changing payments landscape is both\nimportant and exciting, as well as unsettling and disruptive. While a real-time payment\ninfrastructure for retail payments is the nation’s most significant modernization in more than 40\nyears, other innovations such as digital currencies enabled by technological advancements\ncontinue to emerge. Determining what role they might play in safely and effectively serving the\nbroader payments needs of U.S. households and businesses will require careful public policy\nresearch and analysis.\nIn the case of faster payments, the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to build and operate\na real-time payment system also followed years of research and analysis, including broad public\nengagement. Beyond their popularity for speed and convenience, faster payments demonstrate\nvalue in yielding real economic benefits. In particular, individuals and businesses could realize\nmore flexibility to manage their money and to make time-sensitive payments whenever needed.\nThese advantages could result in better cash flow management and efficiencies for small\nbusinesses, and enable some individuals to avoid high-cost borrowing and penalties such as\noverdraft or late fees.\nGiven these potential economic benefits, the Federal Reserve determined that upgrades to\nthe payments capabilities of both the Federal Reserve and the private sector were important. To\nfacilitate private-sector advancements, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors approved in\n2017 access to accounts that would allow settlement between and among banks participating in\nprivate-sector payment systems. At the same time, the Federal Reserve began to assess the Faster\n\n1\n\n\fPayments Task Force’s recommendation, asking it to evaluate what role the Reserve Banks\nmight play in providing real-time settlement services. This year, the Board announced its\ndecision to operate a real-time payment service alongside the private sector. It also announced\nthat further efforts to support private sector services through exploring expansion of hours for the\nFedwire Funds Service and the National Settlement Service would follow.\nRecognizing that time to market is important, the Federal Reserve has committed to\nlaunching this new service, known as FedNow, as soon as possible. Work is underway now to\nengage with industry participants on the initial design and features of the service.\nAs financial institutions prepare to connect to this critical infrastructure, some are raising\nquestions about the strategic choices they face. I’d like to address three such questions in my\nremarks today. First, will the private and public options be interoperable to ensure the systems\nwork together seamlessly and ubiquitously? Second, will the pricing scheme be the same for all\nbanks regardless of their size? Third, how soon will the FedNow Service be operational? Before\naddressing each of those questions, I first want to briefly discuss the Federal Reserve’s history as\na payments provider as context.\n\nFROM THE BEGINNING\nAlthough real-time payments represents a significant evolution in our payments system, it\nis not the first time our payments system has been through a significant transition. History shows\nthat the central bank has worked effectively with the private sector and that the nature of this\npartnership has benefitted the system, its participants and the public.\nThe Panic of 1907 was a catalyst in the creation of the Federal Reserve. One of the\nhallmarks of the 1907 financial crisis was a nationwide currency shortage that left businesses\n\n2\n\n\funable to pay workers and settle accounts. Absent a central bank, a few large private institutions\nheld tremendous influence over the financial system. When these institutions were either\nunwilling or unable to provide necessary liquidity, local bankers would band together and issue\nspecial certificates that effectively functioned as a privately-issued currency. Creating a central\nbank was intended in part to address what had been referred to as a “famine of currency,” during\nthis crisis. This new central bank, according to Carter Glass, one of its congressional founders,\nneeded to “tear down these tollgates upon the highways of commerce.”\nEarly on, the Fed developed a nationwide par clearance system for checks that ensured\nthat a recipient of a payment received the full value regardless of location. In the 1950s, when\nrising check volumes and a lack of standardization even in the physical dimensions of checks\nwere proving problematic to banks, the Fed and the American Bankers Association in\npartnership developed the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) system.\nIn the 1970s, the Fed and private sector developed the automated clearinghouse network\n(ACH) to improve efficiency in the handling of many routine and recurring payments, thus\neliminating the need and cost associated with processing paper checks in these instances.\nDuring the 1990s, the Fed recognized that the internet’s growing role in our economy\nwould prompt a similar evolution in payments, which then were still largely made by check. A\nnational commission headed by Alice Rivlin, vice chair of the Fed’s Board of Governors at the\ntime, explored the future of the Fed’s role in retail payment services. Through a public feedback\nprocess, the commission reached two conclusions. First, the Federal Reserve Banks should\ncontinue to serve as an operator for retail payments. Second, the Fed should work collaboratively\n\n3\n\n\fwith the banking industry to improve efficiency and develop strategies for the movement toward\na digital payments environment.1\nIn the immediate aftermath of 9/11, when some banks sought to limit customer\nwithdrawals, the Fed assured the public it was open and ready to meet liquidity needs while\nfinding alternative ground transportation for check transfers. Importantly, the Fed pledged to\nimmediately credit to banks all checks it processed. This promise to honor “float” provided a key\nsource of liquidity.\nIn the months after the 9/11 attacks, the Fed played a key role in promoting greater use of\nelectronic check processing to eliminate significant inefficiencies in the payments system.\nCongress ultimately passed legislation, known as Check 21, to support the nationwide\nachievement of this improvement to our payment system.\nThis historical record shows that having the Federal Reserve as an operator within the\npayments system has yielded public benefits. This record also suggests that participation in realtime settlement services will raise performance and accountability for the FedNow Service and\nothers.\n\nTHE ROAD TO FEDNOW\nFrom the Rivlin Commission to the efficiencies gained through Check 21, the Federal\nReserve, working with the industry, had already taken the first steps on the road that would lead\nto today’s faster payments supported by real-time settlement infrastructure. Over the past six\nyears, there have been a number of collaborative initiatives between the Federal Reserve and\nindustry stakeholders on strategies for improving the payment system.\n\n“The Federal Reserve in the Payments Mechanism.” Federal Reserve System. January\n1998.https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/1998/19980105/19980105.pdf\n1\n\n4\n\n\fAmong these, in 2015, the Federal Reserve convened the Faster Payments Task Force, a\n320-member group comprised of a broad range of industry participants. Its conclusions – that the\nFederal Reserve should develop a 24x7x365 settlement service to support faster payments and\nexplore and assess the need for other Federal Reserve operational role(s) in faster payments –\naligned with both the outcomes of the Rivlin Commission and the Fed’s longstanding role in\npayments. The United States Treasury shared that view, recommending last year that “the\nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payment system, such as through the\ndevelopment of a real-time settlement service, that would also allow for more efficient and\nubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”2\nThroughout its history, access to Fed payment services, such as check, ACH, and funds\ntransfer services, has facilitated the banking system’s ability to deliver its services with\nnationwide reach. In addition, these services have traditionally operated alongside private-sector\nservices, achieving broad public benefits. Giving the industry choices in payments services, this\ncompetition has spurred lower costs, increased efficiencies and better service for users, as noted\nby independent reviews including the Government Accountability Office in 2016.3\n\nQUESTIONS\nWith this historical context, I’ll turn to each of the three questions I noted earlier: 1) will\nthe private and public options be interoperable to ensure the systems work together seamlessly\n\nU.S. Treasury, “A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunity: Nonbank Financials, Fintech, and\nInnovation,” (July 2018) at 156. Available at https://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018-08/A-Financial-System-that2\n\nCreates-Economic-Opportunities---Nonbank-Financials-Fintech-and-Innovation.pdf\n\n“Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase\nAssurance of Cost Accuracy.” U.S. Government Accountability Office. August 30, 2016.\nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-614. https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/679388.pdf\n3\n\n5\n\n\fand ubiquitously? 2) Will the pricing scheme be the same for all banks regardless of their size?\n3) How soon will FedNow be operational?\nThe importance of interoperability was prominent in the desired attributes of a faster\npayment system based on the Faster Payments Task Force’s work. In a market structure with\nmultiple operators of real-time gross settlement services for faster payments, the ability to secure\nnationwide access is advanced when customers of a bank participating in one service are able to\nreach the customers of a bank participating in another service. Similar to the efficiencies gained\nthrough the development of a consistent MICR system with checks in the 1950s, and the\nnationwide reach achieved with existing payment services, common standards and rules for\nseamless processing of real-time payment messages is a desirable feature. But it is one the\nFederal Reserve recognizes may be difficult to achieve, at least early on.\nAcross the existing payments landscape, services with multiple operators have been able\nto achieve the goal of nationwide reach. Although the approaches differ, they have functioned\neffectively.\nOne approach allows the direct exchange of payments between operators, where\npayments originated by a participant of one service could be received by a participant of another\nservice. This situation exists today in the case of the ACH system. The direct exchange of\nmessages between operators would require technical functionality to move the messages and a\nmethod to enable settlement across systems and participants. The level of cooperation between\noperators and complexity increases significantly with this approach. I don’t consider it an\ninsurmountable challenge, but it could take time to achieve, and thus, it may not be an initial\nelement of the FedNow Service.\n\n6\n\n\fAnother approach to achieving nationwide reach is for financial institutions to participate\nin multiple services that are not interoperable, but where at least one service has achieved\nnationwide reach on its own. Such an approach is used today in the funds transfer system. A\nfinancial institution that participates in multiple services can choose which service to use for\ntransactions, depending on any number of factors, such as fees, functionality, and counterparties\na particular service can reach.\nAs we engage with the industry, we are exploring these approaches and other potential\npaths to achieving the ultimate goal of nationwide reach for faster payments. We also recognize\nthat the initial approach may change over time as technology, industry practices, and the\nrelationship between real-time gross settlement services for faster payments evolve. To be sure,\nthe Federal Reserve is committed to exploring with the industry interoperability and other paths\nto achieving ubiquity.\nA second question that has surfaced relates to how the FedNow service will be priced. As\nnoted in the Federal Register Notice, the Board of Governors will announce the FedNow fee\nstructure and fee schedule before the service is launched. This transparency in pricing will take\ninto account prevailing market practices and can be expected to include a combination of peritem fees, charged to sending and potentially to receiving banks, and fixed participation fees.\nAs with existing services, the FedNow Service will be subject to the Monetary Control\nAct which requires that aggregate revenues match costs over the long run and requires the Board\nof Governors to adopt pricing principles specifically to avoid unfair competition with the private\nsector. The Federal Reserve follows a transparent process in describing its schedule of fees for\neach service line in an annual notice to the public.\n\n7\n\n\fBecause the current private sector service initially proposed flat-fee pricing, questions\nhave been raised about whether the Fed will offer the same pricing or a volume-based pricing\nstructure. Implicit in this question is whether one approach is fairer than the other.\nPricing based on volume or bulk is common in many industries. In the context of\npayment services, there are often large fixed costs. When a service has more volume, it is able to\noffer the service at a lower price because the costs are spread out over more transactions. Unlike\nservices provided to a small group of participants with high transaction volumes, Federal\nReserve services are provided to a diverse group of participants that vary in terms of size and\ntransaction volume.\nIn such circumstances, volume-based pricing helps ensure sufficient use of the service to\nspread costs over greater volumes, yielding lower prices for all participants. Because of these\nbenefits, volume-based pricing has been considered an acceptable pricing strategy, as noted in\nthe 2016 GAO review. That said, a pricing structure for the FedNow Service has not yet been\ndetermined.\nFinally, we have received a number of questions about the timing and a desire to see the\nnew service delivered quickly. Recognizing that time to market is an important consideration for\nmany industry participants, the Federal Reserve has committed to launching the new FedNow\nService as soon as we can. Efforts are now underway to gather input from industry participants\non the initial design and features of the service. As these details are finalized, the Board of\nGovernors will publish a final service description.\nWhile the initial availability of the FedNow Service is a top priority for the Federal\nReserve, the achievement of true nationwide reach remains a critical measure of success for\nfaster payments for any service, including the FedNow Service or a private-sector service.\n\n8\n\n\fConnecting more than 10,000 financial institutions to a faster payment service will take some\ntime. For example, by the middle of 2019, banks that had joined the private-sector service\nrepresented less than 1 percent of all U.S. banking institutions.\nIn addition to moving quickly to deliver the service, we will ensure that industry\nparticipants are prepared to connect to the FedNow Service. Ahead of the service’s availability,\nthe Federal Reserve will be working closely with banks and their technology partners to prepare\nfor expeditious onboarding.\nBeyond the questions related to interoperability, pricing and time to market, the safety of\nthe payment system is crucial to the nation’s economic growth and financial stability. The\nFederal Reserve has historically played an important role in promoting the safety of the U.S.\npayment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in times of crisis. As\nprominence of faster payments in the United States grows, the development of the FedNow\nService will allow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support the\nbanking system and the broader economy.\nAs operator of the FedNow Service, the Federal Reserve also will be in a position to\npromote the development and implementation of industry-wide standards, as has been the case in\nother payments systems where the Fed plays an operational role. Given the irrevocable, real-time\nnature of faster payments, the ability to detect and prevent fraud will be a key aspect of ensuring\nsafety of the system.\n\nCONCLUSION\nInnovation brings important benefits to our economy. We are seeing faster payments\nservices grow in popularity. An efficient payment system facilitates and encourages economic\n\n9\n\n\factivity by making it faster, cheaper, and more convenient for individuals and businesses to pay\nfor goods and services. Creating real-time settlement services in the U.S. lays a foundation on\nwhich both banks across the country and the broader payment industry can build modern,\ninnovative, and safe faster payment services.\nThe Federal Reserve has been core to that system for more than a century. In response to\ntoday’s need for real-time settlement services, we are moving quickly to deliver the FedNow\nService. Decisions about interoperability and pricing across multiple providers are yet to come,\nbut the Federal Reserve’s history points to a strong public policy focus on objectives for access,\nequity and safety that will guide the answer to these questions. Importantly, the FedNow Service\nwill support the innovative solutions available to consumers and businesses today, and many\nmore I anticipate are yet to be thought of, although they may only be just around the corner.\n\n10\n\n\f"

            "content": "Price Stability: A Main Street Perspective\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 6, 2019\nNational Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting\nDenver, Colorado\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fThank you and welcome to Denver — one of three branch cities in the Tenth Federal\nReserve District, headquartered in Kansas City. Our Denver Branch serves Colorado, Wyoming,\nand northern New Mexico and provides valuable insight into local and regional economic\nconditions through contacts and relationships fostered by our Branch staff and Board of\nDirectors. The Federal Reserve’s founders knew that the long-term success and credibility of the\ninstitution would rely on its ability to serve the diverse interests, geographies, and industries that\nmake up the U.S. economy. By maintaining close regional relationships throughout our District,\nincluding Colorado, we are able to ensure that a regional perspective can be represented at policy\nmeetings in Washington, D.C.\nIn addition to providing regional economic insights, the Branch engages in the\nsupervision and regulation of financial institutions, provides cash services to these institutions,\nand promotes financial education and community development through a variety of programs.\nOur Denver Branch is located just a few blocks from this location, and we hope that you’ll join\nus for a reception at the Branch tomorrow evening.\nThis afternoon I would like to focus my remarks on how I view the Federal Reserve’s\ninflation objective in relation to its dual mandate for price stability and maximum employment.1\nAs I hear from many academics, financial market participants, and central bankers, there appears\nto be considerable angst over the fact that inflation has fallen persistently below the Fed’s\ninflation objective of 2 percent. It has given rise to increased interest in alternative monetary\npolicy strategies that might better anchor inflation at 2 percent and is one reason why the Federal\nReserve has embarked on an unprecedented public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools,\nand communications.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Kansas City Vice President and Economist George Kahn for his assistance in preparing these\nremarks.\n\n1\n\n\fViewed from the perspective of Main Street, however, stakeholders show little concern\nabout inflation running below the Fed’s target. They see the U.S. economy is currently in a good\nplace. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, inflation is low and stable, and the economy\nis growing near potential. In the midst of the longest business cycle expansion in history,\ninflation running a few tenths of a percent below 2 percent is, in itself, not a compelling\njustification for providing additional monetary policy accommodation.\nIn my comments today, I will focus on three issues related to inflation dynamics,\nparticularly as they relate to the Fed’s price stability mandate. First, what explains low inflation\nin the United States? Second, is low inflation currently a problem? And third, to the extent low\ninflation is a problem, how should the Fed respond?\n\nWhat Explains Low Inflation in the United States?\nTo begin, let me discuss some of the factors that may be contributing to continued low\ninflation in the United States. As the economic expansion enters its 11th year, questions continue\nto linger whether inflation will eventually accelerate in the midst of an ever more mature\nexpansion.2 While the dynamics of inflation during this expansion have surprised many\nobservers, including myself, my current outlook for inflation remains fairly benign.\nThroughout much of this year, lower-than-expected readings on inflation, as measured by\nthe personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, have led 12-month measures of\ninflation to decline relative to last year. PCE inflation currently stands at 1.4 percent as of August\n2019, down from 2.3 percent in August 2018. Core PCE inflation, which strips out the volatile\nfood and energy components from the consumption basket, also moved lower over the past year.\n\n2\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research dates the start of the recovery in June 2009.\n\n2\n\n\fCore PCE inflation declined to 1.8 percent at an annual rate in August 2019 from 2.0 percent in\nAugust 2018.\nInflation moved lower over the past year despite the unemployment rate edging below 4\npercent. This recent behavior of inflation suggests to me that factors other than the domestic\nlabor market may be driving inflation. For example, I see global inflationary trends as an\nimportant factor keeping inflation pressures muted in the United States.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted its numerical, longer-run\nobjective of a 2 percent annual change in the PCE price index in 2012. Since then, this measure\nof U.S. inflation has averaged about 1.4 percent. However, the United States is not alone in terms\nof falling short of its longer-run inflation target. Several other major foreign economies also have\nstruggled to reach their longer-run inflation objectives, including the euro area and Japan.3 More\nbroadly across the globe, inflation declined throughout the last decade. Among nearly 200\ncountries in the IMF’s database of international statistics, the share of countries with inflation\nabove 2 percent has, in recent years, declined to levels last witnessed in the 1960s.4\nWhile there are certainly some specific challenges shaping inflation in each economy,\nincluding where they stand in their own business cycle, these recent patterns suggest some\ncommon forces are likely keeping global inflation trends subdued. First, we’ve witnessed the\nwidespread adoption of inflation targets in advanced and emerging economies. As more central\nbanks pursue policies to keep inflation low, other countries export less inflation globally. This\nfactor may be at work in the United States recently as import price inflation currently remains\n\n3\n\nThe United Kingdom is one advanced economy that has recently experienced above target rates of inflation amid a\nrapid and large depreciation of their currency following the Brexit vote.\n4\nThe International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics database and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity research staff calculations. Of 193 countries and areas, the share with a 3-year moving average of inflation\nabove 2 percent declined from 97 percent at the end of 2008 to 51 percent as of the end of 2018. While the database\ncovers 198 countries and areas, data on inflation is missing for five of them.\n\n3\n\n\flower than during 2004-2007 — a period in which the unemployment rate also reached its\ncyclical low but inflation was running slightly above 2 percent.\nSecond, changes in commodity price dynamics may have significant consequences for\nglobal inflation. Unlike past decades, the advent of nimble U.S. oil production seems likely to\nkeep energy prices in check even amidst oil supply disruptions and shortages. As a result, oil\nprice inflation has been lower in recent years than in the 2004-2007 period, possibly helping\nexplain why the current low unemployment rate is failing to generate as much inflation in the\nUnited States as in past expansions. The global nature of commodity markets suggests that these\ndevelopments are likely to affect inflation outcomes in the United States as well as other\ncountries.\nAnd third, the e-commerce induced disruption to global retail represents a global factor\nwhich may weigh on inflation, although its exact effects are difficult to quantify. Comparing to\nthe 2004-2007 period, the share of U.S. retail sales accounted for by non-store retailers has\ndoubled from around 7 percent to nearly 15 percent. As major retailers compete for global\nmarket share, perhaps at the cost of margins, retail price inflation is likely to remain tame.\nBeyond these longer-term global trends, the rapidly changing trade environment threatens\nthe rise of global supply chains, and I see the persistent effects from the ongoing trade dispute as\ndisinflationary for the United States. In particular, the uneven effects of the changes in trade\npolicy on our trading partners, coupled with the safety and security of the U.S. dollar in an era of\nuncertainty, has generally led to a rise in the foreign-exchange value of the dollar against other\ncurrencies. These forces, along with ongoing geopolitical risks, likely further reinforced the\nstrength in the U.S. dollar over the past year. As a result, I expect that global disinflationary\ntrends, embodied in low import price inflation, will continue to weigh on U.S. inflation.\n\n4\n\n\fIn addition to global factors, domestic factors also are at play. For example, recent\nresearch at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City highlights that, after growing rapidly at\nroughly 7 percent per year over the 1980-2004 period, college tuition prices have slowed\nmarkedly, averaging much closer to 2 percent over the last few years.5 Other staff analysis\nhighlights that inflation for medical care services, a fairly large and important component of the\npersonal consumption expenditure price index, has also been substantially weaker over the last\ndecade.6 These sector-specific factors, such as changes in state appropriations to higher\neducation or changes to the Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors, are important drivers of\nchanges in the inflation rates for these various components. Given that these idiosyncratic,\nsector-specific factors are unlikely to be directly affected by changes in labor market slack, some\ncomponents of inflation may remain muted even if the overall economy is operating at or near\npotential. Such factors are beyond the reach of monetary policy to control.\n\nIs Low Inflation Currently a Problem?\nWhile I have suggested a number of reasons why inflation has been low in the United\nStates, should we be concerned that inflation is running persistently a few tenths of a percent\nbelow the Fed’s objective of 2 percent? My answer to that question is based partly on my\ninteractions with business and community leaders but, in addition, depends on the broader\neconomic circumstances that coincide with low inflation.\nAs I listen to business and community leaders around my region, I hear few complaints\nabout inflation being too low. In fact, I am more likely to hear disbelief when I mention that\n\nBrent Bundick and Emily Pollard, “The Rise and Fall of College Tuition Inflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City Economic Review, First Quarter, 2019.\n6\nPresentation by A. Lee Smith at the BLS Data User’s Conference.\n5\n\n5\n\n\finflation is as low as measured in a number of key sectors. This leads me to the observation that\ninflation as experienced by households and businesses is fundamentally different from inflation\nas viewed by many financial market participants and economists. Households see the prices of\neveryday goods such as food, energy, rents, and health care rising and don’t understand why the\nFed would be concerned that inflation is too low. Their short-run expectations for inflation are\ndriven largely by changes in retail gasoline prices while their longer-run expectations, as\nmeasured by the University of Michigan, have been fairly stable. (Expected changes in prices\nduring the next 5 years have fluctuated between 2.3 and 2.6 percent since April 2016 and are\ncurrently at 2.4 percent.)\nBusinesses see their labor and other input costs rising, and with limited pricing power,\nsee their profit margins squeezed. For them, the product prices they charge are determined by\nstructural factors such as global competition and technological disruption that don’t necessarily\nrespond to monetary policy, while their costs are driven by tight labor and commodity market\nconditions. In the August survey of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of\nIndependent Business, only 1 percent of respondents said inflation was their single most\nimportant problem, compared with 27 percent who said “quality of labor” and 9 percent who said\n“cost of labor.” I would also point out that in the last NABE outlook survey (June 2019), your\noutlook panelists’ median forecast for core PCE price inflation for each quarter of 2020 was 2.0\npercent at an annual rate — right at the Fed’s longer-run objective.\nPhilip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, summed it up well at our\nJackson Hole symposium when he said “…many people in our communities are incredulous that\nwe would be too worried over whether inflation was 1.6 per cent, 2.0 per cent or 2.2 per cent.\nThey ask, ‘haven’t you got something more important to worry about?’”\n\n6\n\n\fBeyond this view of inflation from Main Street, I also keep in mind the Fed’s dual\nmandate. Unlike some central banks, we are tasked not only with achieving price stability, but in\naddition, we have a mandate to achieve maximum employment. In circumstances where the\nunemployment rate is high and inflation is low, as was the case throughout much of the recovery\nfrom the Great Recession, policymakers typically ease policy to bring both variables in line with\ntheir longer-run objectives. Low inflation can be a symptom of economic slack, and\naccommodative policy tends to reduce unemployment and increase inflation. In these\ncircumstances, the direction of policy is clear and policymaker consensus is relatively easy to\nachieve.\nIn other circumstances — such as we have today — with both unemployment and\ninflation low relative to their longer-run objectives, the policy response is not so clear. On one\nhand, easing policy might lift inflation, but at the cost of further tightening an already hot labor\nmarket and perhaps fostering financial imbalances. And given the reduced responsiveness of\ninflation to economic slack, it might take a considerable dose of monetary accommodation to\nnudge inflation upward. On the other hand, tightening policy might limit the overheating of labor\nmarkets, but at the cost of putting further downward pressure on inflation.\nIn these circumstances, where the objectives are not complementary, the FOMC’s\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategies lays out the framework of a\n“balanced approach” in promoting them. In particular, we take into account the magnitude of the\ndeviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are\nprojected to return to mandate-consistent levels.\nNot surprisingly, under this balanced approach, there may be disagreement about a\nnumber of the factors that determine appropriate policy. For example, policymakers may\n\n7\n\n\fdisagree about the amount of slack in labor markets or the relative costs of deviations of inflation\nand unemployment from their objectives. From my perspective, the deviation from our inflation\nobjective is currently small, but given structural changes in inflation dynamics, trying to quickly\nreturn inflation to 2 percent by adjusting interest rates could require aggressive actions that\nwould misallocate resources and create financial imbalances.\nMy dissent at the last two FOMC meetings was based in part on balancing our objectives\nfor price stability and maximum employment. I dissented from the Committee’s decision to\nlower the target range for the federal funds rate in July and September because the moderation of\neconomic growth in 2019 has been in line with my own outlook that calls for a gradual decline to\na trend level over the medium term. With moderate growth, record low unemployment, and a\nbenign inflation outlook, maintaining an unchanged setting for policy would have been\nappropriate, in my view. There are certainly risks to the outlook as the economy faces trade\npolicy uncertainty and weaker global activity. Should incoming data point to a broadly weaker\neconomy, adjusting policy may be appropriate to achieve the Federal Reserve’s mandates for\nmaximum sustainable employment and stable prices.\nBut in the absence of more evidence that the downside risks may be realized, muted\ninflation alone would not warrant a policy response. Rather than focusing too narrowly on\nachieving a precise point target of 2 percent inflation, I find it more realistic to accept that there\nwill be both temporary and persistent fluctuations around this long-run target and, as long as they\ndon’t exceed a reasonable threshold — perhaps as big as 50 or even 100 basis points —they\nshould be tolerated, depending on broader economic conditions. Keeping our sights set on low\nand stable inflation is key, with 2 percent as our North Star and longer-run inflation objective.\n\n8\n\n\fWhen is Low Inflation a Concern and What Can Be Done About It?\nSo when should we be concerned about low inflation and what can be done about it? As\nI’ve suggested, in current circumstances, concern about low inflation seems unnecessary. While I\ndo not see a case for deliberately easing policy to boost inflation, the Fed’s 2 percent inflation\ntarget also should not be viewed as a ceiling. Rather, it seems reasonable to allow modest\nunexpected shocks to inflation — perhaps stemming from import prices — to demonstrate to the\npublic a commitment to achieving our inflation goal on a symmetric basis.\nIn contrast, if conditions change so that the goals of policy are no longer in conflict,\npolicymakers should be prepared to adjust policy as necessary. For example, if weaker global\ndemand and trade policy uncertainty were to materially weaken my modal outlook for growth,\nproviding additional monetary accommodation may be warranted. Such a response to changing\neconomic conditions would support both the economic expansion and help offset further\ndownward pressure on inflation.\nWere a more-severe downturn to hit the economy, policymakers are keenly aware that\nlittle policy space remains with the federal funds rate currently at 1¾ to 2 percent. The prospect\nof such a situation makes the Fed’s reevaluation of its policy strategies and objectives a timely\nundertaking. The review has several parts, including a series of Fed Listens events around the\ncountry designed to help policymakers better understand the perspectives of people from diverse\nbackgrounds and with varied interests. In fact, we’ll host such an event in Kansas City this week.\nA few months ago, the Chicago Fed held a conference that brought together a distinguished\ngroup of academics, financial market experts, and labor leaders to share their perspectives on\nhow the Federal Reserve can best achieve its mandate. Finally, the FOMC, supported by staff\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System, is devoting time at its regular meetings to assess lessons\n\n9\n\n\flearned in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Whether or not we ultimately make any changes\nto our framework, this review is essential in my view to the credibility of our decision-making,\nour commitment to transparency, and our collective learning about the changing landscape. I\nhope the exercise will become a regular feature of the Committee’s policy framework.\n\nConclusion\nIn closing, the U.S. economy is currently in a good place with low inflation, low\nunemployment, and an outlook for continued moderate growth. In these circumstances, I am not\nconcerned that inflation is running a bit below our objective of 2 percent. Persistently muted\ninflation is the result of a confluence of temporary and structural factors that are not particularly\nresponsive to interest rate adjustments. Therefore, a degree of flexibility in how we interpret our\nprice stability mandate seems appropriate. Should conditions change, however, and we find\nourselves again at the zero lower bound, a fundamentally different strategy may be needed. In\nanticipation of that possibility, now is a good time for a thorough review of policy strategies,\ntools, and communications.\n\n10\n\n\f"

            "content": "Robert Owen and the Federal Reserve\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 4, 2019\nEconomic Forum\nTahlequah, Oklahoma\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fI am delighted to join you today.\nI’d like to spend a few moments talking about the Federal Reserve’s important\nconnection to Tahlequah. The history and design of our nation’s central bank is often\nmisunderstood, but is as important today as ever. Tahlequah is an especially appropriate location\nto discuss this history because events that occurred in this area more than a century ago had a\ndirect and significant impact on the Fed’s design.\nAs you may know, sometime before 1880 a gentleman named Robert L. Owen came to\nthe Tahlequah area as a teacher and supervisor of the Cherokee National School System. The\nhistoric Owen School House, now known as the Park Hill/Owen Community Center, near the\nCherokee Heritage Center that bears his name.\nAfter leaving the school, Owen became a lawyer and practiced law not far from here in\nMuskogee where he organized and served as president of the First National Bank for a decade. In\n1907 he was elected one of Oklahoma’s first United States Senators, making him one of the first\ntwo Native Americans to serve in the Senate.\nHe joined the Senate at a time of economic turmoil. Only a few weeks earlier, the nation\nexperienced a financial crisis that would become known as the Panic of 1907. Soon after,\nCongress began discussions about how to improve the nation’s financial system, launching a\nprocess that would lead to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.\nThere, Owen played a key role, serving as the legislation’s Senate sponsor and chair of\nthe Senate Banking Committee.\nOwen’s 10 years in Oklahoma banking contributed importantly to his thinking about the\nrole of a central bank and how it should be designed. Owen was a banker during a particularly\nvolatile time for our nation’s banks and the U.S. economy. The panic of 1893 led to the closing\n1\n\n\fof 500 banks. Owen later talked about how he saw the problems in the banking sector during this\nperiod ripple across the economy, affecting property values, business failures and\nunemployment, which reached 25 percent or higher in some areas of the United States.\nHe later wrote that the panic of 1893 “demonstrated the complete instability of the\nfinancial system of America and the hazards which businessmen had to meet under a grossly\ndefective banking system.”\nHe had spent much time considering how to address these issues and, as fate would have\nit, was ideally suited to shape a solution when the opportunity was presented.\n\nMISSION AREAS\nBefore I talk about the structure, however, it might be helpful to explain the full mission\nof the Federal Reserve.\nAlthough monetary policy is likely the first thing that comes to mind when the Fed is\nmentioned, as the central bank of the United States, the Fed has other responsibilities that focus\non the stability of our nation’s financial system.\nWe are a banking supervisor with regulatory responsibilities that entail not only\nexamining depository institutions for financial fitness, but also ensuring that all customers are\noffered financial services on fair and appropriate terms. Here we focus on such matters as the\nability of borrowers to access the credit that may be necessary to fund an education, establish a\nbusiness or purchase a home.\nWe are a bank for banks and also serve as the government’s bank. This means we not\nonly hold deposits but we are a provider of important services such as those necessary for the\nsmooth functioning of the payments system. This has included the processing of checks along\n\n2\n\n\fwith the use of other payment rails to transfer funds between depository institutions. Recently,\nyou may have seen some headlines about a new Fed initiative for real-time payments, a system\nwhich will expedite the actual flow of funds to match the speed with which consumers pay for\nthings using apps on their phones or other online services. This initiative, which might be\nthought of as a high-tech plumbing network for the financial system, is the most substantial\ninnovation in payments in at least 40 years.\nAnd, of course, there is our role in conducting the nation’s monetary policy, where we\noperate under a directive from the U.S. Congress that is widely known as the Fed’s dual\nmandate: to foster economic conditions that achieve stable prices and a maximum level of\nsustainable employment.\nThe Fed relies on a substantial foundation of research in support of these operations. The\neconomists who study a variety of economic issues include for example, our Oklahoma City\nBranch with particular expertise in the nation’s energy economy. Others are experts in banking,\nfinancial markets and payments.\n\nTHE FOUNDATION OF TODAY’S FED\nAs I list these responsibilities, it is clear that there are many instances where the financial\nsystem has evolved in ways that Owen and the Fed’s other congressional founders could not\nhave predicted.\nFor example, when Congress was debating the Federal Reserve Act, the gold standard\nwas literally the standard for the world’s most important currencies. That began to change\ninternationally during World War I and changed later in the United States. Thus monetary policy,\nas it is administered by the FOMC today under the delegation of Congress, is an area that has\nseen significant change. In addition, technology has increased the pace of commerce around the\n3\n\n\fglobe. Meanwhile, innovation in financial products and services has fostered with it a\ncorresponding expansion of risks.\nIn the same way the authors of the Constitution could not plan for every eventuality, the\nframers of the Federal Reserve Act recognized that they were establishing a framework for a\ncentral bank that would have to evolve if it would be capable of serving the public interest.\nIn terms of structure and governance, there were two main ideas put forward during the\ndeliberations: On one side were those who supported a decentralized structure under the control\nof the private sector; on the other side were those who believed that the system should be highly\ncentralized under government control.\nOwen, however, believed in what might be considered a third option: He was among\nthose who supported the idea of a balanced system where both sides could share in governance.\nWith a background in rural Oklahoma banking, Owen had understandably strong opinions about\nthe potential risks associated with a central bank operating under Wall Street’s direct control. In\na debate on an early proposal that did not advance, Owen voiced his concern about a system that\nwas “concentrated in any one city where a small clique could control” it.\nSuch an arrangement could present a couple of key risks. First, a closely aligned group of\nlike-minded leaders might not have sufficient perspective for gauging risks since they would\nlikely have similar views. For example, a group dominated by an East Coast perspective might\nnot have an appreciation for the full diversity of our banking system and the economy. No one\nhere needs to be told that the banking needs of a Wall Street firm and a Tahlequah entrepreneur\nare very different.\nThanks in part to Robert Owen, we have a central bank structured in a manner that serves\nour nation well. General oversight of the Federal Reserve is through a government-appointed\n\n4\n\n\fBoard of Governors in Washington, D.C. The 12 regional Reserve Banks, meanwhile, are\nindependent corporations that, along with their affiliated Branch offices, operate under the\nleadership of a local board of directors.\nCurrently, two Oklahomans serve on the Board of Directors of the Kansas City Fed’s\nhead office. Rose Washington, who some may know from her work as CEO of the Tulsa\nEconomic Development Corporation, currently serves as chair, while Doug Stussi, with Love’s\nTravel Stops in Oklahoma City, is a director. Meanwhile, Susan Chapman Plumb from here in\nTahlequah is one of seven Oklahomans serving on the Board of our Oklahoma City Branch.\nIn addition to their oversight roles, these directors are especially important to me in my\nrole representing the Tenth Federal Reserve District in FOMC policy deliberations. Along with\nour advisory councils and other local contacts, they are a source of information regarding\nemerging developments in banking and the economy. As intended by Robert Owen, they are the\ncritical link in ensuring that our nation’s central bank is not an isolated institution but one that\nconsiders the broad economic experience of all Americans.\nThis broad representation across the United States provides the regional Reserve Banks\nwith a degree of protection against a risk that was recognized early in U.S. history by Alexander\nHamilton. That is the risk that politicians could try to wield undue and dangerous influence over\nthe central bank.\nRobert Owen, a school teacher from Tahlequah, might not have imagined that the\ninstitution he shaped more than 100 years ago, would have proven so durable amid the economic\nand political challenges it would face. But I think he would be pleased to see that the Fed, by\ndesign, has a system that provides a forum for civil discourse about monetary policy and other\nimportant central bank issues. And in my view, it continues to serve our nation well.\n\n5\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release on delivery\n2:00 p.m. EDT\nSeptember 26, 2019\n\nStatement by\nEsther George\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\non behalf of\nThe Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nTask Force on Financial Technology\nof the\nCommittee on Financial Services\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nSeptember 26, 2019\n\n\fChair Lynch, Ranking Member Hill and members of the Task Force on Financial\nTechnology, thank you for this opportunity.\nChair Powell has asked me to speak to you today in my role as the Federal Reserve Bank\nleader responsible for the Federal Reserve’s payments improvement initiative since its beginning\nand as chair of the Financial Services Policy Committee (FSPC). The FSPC oversees the\nprovision of payment services to depository institutions and the United States Treasury by the 12\nFederal Reserve Banks. I am pleased to offer my statement for the record as well as an in depth\nstatement on the role of the Federal Reserve in faster payments and the recently announced\nproposal by the Federal Reserve to support faster payments.\nOver the past decade, cell phones and other online capabilities have made it more\nconvenient to send and receive payments. Although these mobile apps appear to provide for an\nimmediate transaction, the underlying infrastructure is not designed to immediately move money\nbetween banks, creating notable delays between the initiation of a retail payment and its receipt.\nTo support the demand for real-time payments in the United States and to address this\ngap, last month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors (Board) announced that the Federal\nReserve Banks would develop a new service called the FedNow Service.\nSince its founding more than a century ago, the Federal Reserve has provided payment\nand settlement services as part of its core function of promoting an accessible, safe and efficient\npayment system for the nation. Today, the Federal Reserve is continuing this important\noperational role and preparing to support the modernization of our nation’s payment system with\ncapabilities that allow payments to move quickly through a safe and efficient foundation, on top\nof which innovation and competition can flourish.\nThis decision was made only after three established criteria were met.\n\n\f2\n\nThe first of these criteria is that it is a service that other providers alone cannot be\nexpected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope and equity.\nOf notable importance related to this criterion is the Federal Reserve’s ability to connect\nto more than 10,000 financial institutions. Through these connections, the Federal Reserve’s\nexisting payment services allow banks of every size to serve the needs of thousands of\ncommunities across the United States with competitive, fair and transparent access. Providing\nthis degree of comprehensive nationwide reach is something that we believe will present\nsignificant challenges to other providers in the current market landscape. Coming from a region\nof the country with a significant number of small community banks serving rural areas of the\ncentral United States, I can tell you the Board’s decision to provide this new service has been\nwell received.\nThe second criterion is that there will be a clear public benefit, including promoting the\nintegrity of the payments system and reducing payments system risk.\nThe Federal Reserve must continue to play an important role in promoting the safety of\nthe U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response to\nfinancial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other crises. The FedNow Service will\nallow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking\nsystem, as well as promote the development and implementation of industry-wide fraudmitigation standards. Development of the service will also enhance safety of the U.S. payment\nsystem by promoting resiliency through redundancy.\nThe final criterion is that the Federal Reserve be able to fully recover its cost over the\nlong run. The U.S. payments infrastructure today includes alternative payment choices and\nproviders. Today, the Federal Reserve and The Clearing House operate competing and\n\n\f3\n\ninteroperable services, which bring important benefits for resiliency and competition. In all of\nour services, we have been able to meet the requirements of the Monetary Control Act for cost\nrecovery that ensures competitive fairness while fulfilling our public policy goals. In this regard,\neven as we develop the FedNow Service, the Federal Reserve will continue to explore ways to\nsupport the market’s existing private-sector real-time payment service including through\nexpanded Fedwire Funds Service and National Settlement Service hours as described in the\nrecent Federal Register notice.\nAs was explained in a 2016 GAO study, the Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has\nlong been judged as effective in promoting accessibility, safety, and efficiency for the nation’s\npayment system and its customers.1, 2 Last summer, the U.S. Treasury recommended that “the\nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payments system, such as through the\ndevelopment of a real-time settlement service, that would also allow for more efficient and\nubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”3 We are engaging now with stakeholders\nfor their input on features of the FedNow Service through the Federal Register notice issued last\nmonth.\nFinally, I found it gratifying after the Federal Reserve started the conversation about\nfaster payments in the U.S. and led four years of stakeholder engagement that culminated in the\noverwhelming majority of 400 comments from industry, consumer, and small business\nexpressing support for the Federal Reserve’s role as a faster payments provider.\n\n“Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase\nAssurance of Cost Accuracy.” U.S. Government Accountability Office.

I am happy to respond to your questions.\n\n\fFaster Payments and the U.S. Payment System\nThe U.S. payment system faces a critical juncture in its evolution. Services to conduct\nfaster payments, which are available via smart phones apps or on our computers, have begun to\nemerge along with the growth of digital commerce. Faster payments allow individuals and\nbusinesses to send and receive payments within seconds, any time of day, on any day of the year,\nsuch that the receiver can use the funds almost instantly. The round-the-clock, real-time nature\nof faster payments offers convenience that is not available with many traditional ways of making\npayments. In addition, faster payments can yield real economic benefits for individuals and\nbusinesses by providing them with more flexibility to manage their money and allowing them to\nmake time-sensitive payments whenever needed.\nYet with many of the faster payment services available today, the underlying\ninfrastructure is not designed to immediately move money between banks, creating notable\ndelays between the initiation of a retail payment and its receipt. These shortcomings limit the\ndegree to which the potential benefits of faster payment services may be widely enjoyed across\nour economy in a safe manner. Further expansion of the interbank infrastructure is needed to\nserve as the foundation for the development of faster payment services that are safe, efficient,\nand broadly accessible to the American public.\nLast month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors (Board) announced that the\nFederal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) would develop a new service called the FedNowSM\nService to support widespread adoption of faster payments in the United States. The FedNow\nService will provide the necessary infrastructure, alongside similar services provided by the\nprivate sector, to connect banks across the country, allowing them to offer innovative faster\npayment services to their customers.\n\n\f-2Since its founding, the Federal Reserve has played a key operational role in the nation’s\npayment system by providing interbank payment infrastructure that is available to banks across\nthe country, regardless of size or location. This critical role, given by Congress, stems from the\nFederal Reserve’s unique ability, as the nation’s central bank, to provide interbank settlement\nwithout introducing liquidity or credit risks. In today’s payment infrastructure, whether in check\nprocessing, automated clearinghouse (ACH) services, or funds transfers, you will see a\nFederal Reserve service operating in healthy competition with and in support of similar services\nprovided by the private sector, all for the benefit of the American public.\nThe importance of this role has been recognized broadly, with an independent review by\nthe U.S. Government Accountability Office concluding that the Federal Reserve’s provision of\npayment services has benefited the U.S. payment system and its users.1 It is important to point\nout, however, that Congress did not grant plenary regulatory or supervisory authority over the\nU.S. payment system to the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve does not have regulatory\nauthority over the pricing set by a private-sector system or to require a private-sector system to\nextend the service to banks of all sizes. In some other countries, central banks have been\nassigned the responsibility for regulating payment systems. In the United States, this is not the\ncase. Thus, the Federal Reserve has historically helped to promote the accessibility, safety, and\nefficiency of the nation’s payment system and advance innovations through its operational role\nas provider of payment and settlement services.\n\nSee U.S. Government Accountability Office, GAO-16-614, “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers\nBenefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase Assurance of Cost Accuracy” (2016). Available at\nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-614.\n1\n\n\f-3Path to Present\nLeading up to the recent FedNow Service decision and announcement in August, the\nFederal Reserve took several actions to facilitate the advancement of faster payments in the\nUnited States. In 2013, the Federal Reserve began a collaborative initiative with industry\nstakeholders to foster improvements to the nation’s payment system. As part of this initiative,\nthe Federal Reserve convened in 2015 the Faster Payments Task Force (FPTF), comprising a\nwide range of industry stakeholders, to identify and evaluate alternative approaches for\nimplementing safe and ubiquitous faster payment capabilities in the United States.\nThe FPTF published in 2017 a set of consensus recommendations focused on actions to\nsupport improvements to the nation’s payment system.2 Among the FPTF’s recommendations\nwere requests for the Federal Reserve (1) to develop a 24x7x365 settlement service to support\nfaster payments and (2) to explore and assess the need for other Federal Reserve operational\nrole(s) in faster payments. Subsequently, the U.S. Department of the Treasury recommended\nthat “the Federal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payments system, such as\nthrough the development of a real-time settlement service, that would also allow for more\nefficient and ubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”3\n\nThese recommendations were intended to help achieve the FPTF’s vision of ubiquitous faster payment capabilities\nin the United States that would allow any end user (that is, an individual or business) to safely, efficiently, and\nseamlessly send a faster payment to any other end user, no matter which banks or payment services they use. See\nFaster Payments Task Force, “Final Report Part Two: A Call to Action,” (July 2017). Available at\nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/faster-payments-task-force-final-report-part-two.pdf.\n2\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury also noted that “[i]n particular, smaller financial institutions, like community\nbanks and credit unions, should also have the ability to access the most-innovative technologies and payment\nservices. While Treasury believes that a payment system led by the private sector has the potential to be at the\nforefront of innovation and allow for the most advanced payment system in the world, back-end Federal Reserve\npayment services must also be appropriately enhanced to enable innovations.” U.S. Treasury, “A Financial System\nThat Creates Economic Opportunity: Nonbank Financials, Fintech, and Innovation,” (July 2018) at 156. Available\nat https://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018-07/A-Financial-System-that-Creates-Economic-Opportunities--Nonbank-Financi.pdf.\n3\n\n\f-4The Federal Reserve also has directly supported the development of private-sector realtime gross settlement (RTGS) services for faster payments. The Board approved in 2017 final\nguidelines for evaluating requests for joint accounts at the Reserve Banks intended to facilitate\nsettlement between and among banks participating in private-sector payment systems for faster\npayments.4 The impetus for allowing broader use of joint accounts was to support these privatesector arrangements.\nIn November 2018, the Board published a Federal Register notice (2018 Notice)\nrequesting comment on two potential actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve\nconsistent with the FPTF recommendations: (1) a service for 24x7x365 real-time interbank\nsettlement of faster payments; and (2) a liquidity management tool that would enable transfers\nbetween accounts held at Reserve Banks on a 24x7x365 basis to support services for real-time\ninterbank settlement of faster payments.\nThe Board explained that a Federal Reserve RTGS service for faster payments, alongside\nprivate-sector RTGS services, would provide the infrastructure needed to achieve ubiquitous,\nsafe, and efficient faster payments in the United States. Other parties, such as banks, payment\nprocessors, and providers of payment services, could utilize this platform as a basis for\ninnovation to meet the specific needs of the businesses and households they serve. The Board\nfurther explained that a liquidity management tool, in turn, could help alleviate liquidity\nmanagement issues for banks engaged in RTGS-based faster payments, notably those utilizing\nsettlement services offered by the private sector. In particular, such a tool would enable\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Guidelines for Evaluating Joint Account Requests,” (Issued\n2017). Available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/joint_requests.htm. In 2016, Federal Reserve\nstaff received a request from a private-sector service provider to open a new joint account for that organization’s\nproposed faster payment system. The use of a joint account at a Reserve Bank to support settlement mitigates\ncertain risks by reproducing, as closely as possible, the risk-free nature of settlement in central bank money.\n4\n\n\f-5movement of funds between accounts at the Reserve Banks during hours when traditional\npayment and settlement services are currently not open to allow liquidity to be moved, when\nneeded, to an account or accounts used to support real-time settlement of faster payments. The\n2018 Notice proposed that the tool could be provided by expanding operating hours of current\nFederal Reserve services or through a new service.\nIn the 2018 Notice, the Board requested comment on the appropriateness of real-time\ngross settlement as the strategic foundation for faster payments in the United States and the\npublic benefits, implications, and challenges of the Federal Reserve taking either, both, or neither\nof the potential actions.\nConsideration of Comments and Policy Assessment\nThe Board received over 400 comment letters representing over 800 entities in response\nto the 2018 Notice. Comments were submitted by a wide variety of stakeholders in the U.S.\npayment system, including community banks, individuals, consumer organizations, merchants,\nservice providers, private-sector operators, fintech companies, trade organizations, and other\ninterested parties.5 Consistent with the diversity of the payment industry, commenters\nrepresented a broad range of viewpoints.\nAlmost all commenters addressed the question of whether the Federal Reserve should\ndevelop a real-time interbank settlement service for faster payments. The vast majority of these\ncommenters, representing nearly every stakeholder segment, supported the Federal Reserve\n\n5\n\nOverall, banks were the largest group of respondents, with community banks (small and midsize banks)\ncomprising approximately 60 percent of the total comments—the largest specific segment—and representing\ninstitutions from 34 states.\n\n\f-6taking this action. In contrast, large banks, some trade organizations, and private-sector\noperators were generally not supportive of the Federal Reserve developing such a service.6\nIn reaching its decision to offer the FedNow Service, the Board was informed by these\npublic comments and the history of the U.S. payment system, in which the Federal Reserve has\nplayed a role since its inception. In addition, any decision by the Board to offer a new payment\nservice is subject to the factors set out in longstanding Federal Reserve policy, and the pricing of\nReserve Bank services is subject to the requirements of the Monetary Control Act of 1980.7\nSpecifically, in considering new services, the Board assesses three criteria: whether the service is\none that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness,\nscope, and equity; whether the service will yield a clear public benefit; and whether the\nFederal Reserve will achieve full cost recovery over the long run.8\nOther Providers Criterion\nThrough this assessment, the Board has concluded that other providers alone cannot be\nexpected to provide an RTGS infrastructure for faster payments with reasonable effectiveness,\nscope, and equity. So far, only one private-sector RTGS service for faster payments has been\nestablished in the United States. Due to coordination challenges and the high fixed costs\nnecessary to develop a new payment and settlement service, this service is expected to remain\nthe sole private-sector RTGS service for faster payments in the United States. The ability of a\n\n6\n\nApproximately half of the commenters discussed the liquidity management tool, with almost all supporting the\nFederal Reserve offering such a tool.\n7\nIn 1984, the Board established criteria for the consideration of new or enhanced Federal Reserve payment services\nin its policy The Federal Reserve in the Payment System. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “The\nFederal Reserve in the Payments System,” (Issued 1984; revised 1990). Available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/pfs_frpaysys.htm.\n8\nIn addition, the Board performs a competitive impact analysis when considering an operational or legal change to a\nReserve Bank service or price that would have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other providers\nof services to compete with the Reserve Banks.\n\n\f-7sole private-sector provider to extend access to a few thousand banks, let alone the more than\n10,000 diverse banks necessary to achieve true nationwide scope, would be costly and timeconsuming given that the existing service has limited relationships with and connections to these\ninstitutions.\nIn addition, the Board concluded that the private-sector operator alone cannot be\nexpected to provide the service with reasonable effectiveness, as viewed through the lenses of\nsafety and efficiency. From a safety perspective, a sole provider may serve as a single point of\nfailure in the market for RTGS-based faster payments. From an efficiency perspective, a market\nwith only a single operator may cause challenges related to competition, innovation, and market\nfragmentation. According to established economic theory and experience from other markets, a\nsingle service provider not facing competition can yield undesirable outcomes, such as higher\nprices or lower service quality. Such undesirable outcomes could limit adoption of faster\npayments by end users, which could in turn curtail efficiency benefits to the broader economy.\nPublic Benefits Criterion\nThe Board also determined that the FedNow Service will yield a clear public benefit.\nSince its inception, an underlying public policy rationale for the Federal Reserve’s involvement\nin the payment system has been to provide services in a safe and efficient manner to banks\nnationwide. Because of this long-standing policy commitment, the Federal Reserve has\nhistorically extended access to banks of all sizes, including smaller banks in rural and remote\nareas of the country. The Federal Reserve’s relationships with and connections to thousands of\nbanks across the country provide a solid foundation for the FedNow Service to facilitate those\nbanks gaining access to an RTGS infrastructure for faster payments, which would benefit small\nand midsize banks and the communities they serve.\n\n\f-8In a payment system with multiple operators, banks would have a choice whether to join\na single service or multiple services. An RTGS infrastructure could, therefore, achieve\nnationwide reach in two main ways, either through interoperability via direct exchange of\npayments between operators, such as in the U.S. ACH system, or through at least one service\nconnecting to virtually all banks, such as in the funds transfer system.\nThe FedNow Service would promote payment system safety in multiple ways. As noted\nby commenters, the Federal Reserve has historically played an important role in promoting the\nsafety of the U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response\nto financial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other crises. As the prominence of\nfaster payments in the United States grows, the development of the FedNow Service would allow\nthe Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking system and\nthe broader economy in times of crisis. In addition, as the operator of the service, the\nFederal Reserve would be in a position to promote the development and implementation of\nindustry-wide fraud-mitigation standards, which commenters highlighted are especially\nimportant for real-time payments. The development of the service could also enhance the safety\nof the U.S. payment system by promoting resiliency through redundancy.\nFinally, the FedNow Service could provide efficiency benefits by serving as a platform\nfor innovation and the development of end-user services by the private sector. In addition, an\nRTGS infrastructure with nationwide reach would make the development of new faster payment\nservices based on real-time settlement more attractive, increasing innovation and competition in\nthe market for end-user faster payment services. Such competition could yield efficiency\nbenefits by leading to lower prices and higher service quality.\n\n\f-9Cost Recovery Criterion\nThe Board expects that the FedNow Service will achieve full recovery of costs over\nthe long run. The MCA requirement to require cost recovery “over the long run” is not\nassociated with a specific timeframe. Beginning in 1995, the Board adopted a convention\nof evaluating long-run cost recovery for existing services using a rolling 10-year period. At\nthat time, Federal Reserve services were in mature states, characterized by widespread\nadoption by banks of all sizes throughout the country, with relatively stable volumes and\ncosts. At other times, notably as the ACH service was evolving, the Board considered long\nrun over an extended time period in order to encourage the adoption of electronic payments\nfor the benefit of the economy.9\nGiven the time frame necessary to create a broad network of banks connecting to the\nservice, the Board determined that a longer time frame for cost recovery is consistent with\nthe intent of the MCA to encourage the adoption of new services that have the potential to\nbring widespread economic benefits to the country.\nExpanded Hours for Existing Services\nThe second proposed action in the 2018 Notice entailed the exploration of the expansion\nof operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service, which is our existing funds transfer service,\nand National Settlement Service (NSS) hours, which is our service that supports private-sector\nnet settlement arrangements, potentially up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity management,\nnotably for users of private-sector RTGS services.\n\n9\n\nACH began as a Federal Reserve service in the 1970s, prior to the passage of the MCA. In 1981, when the pricing\nprinciples were first applied to ACH, the Board recognized that the ACH service was still evolving and allowed fees\nto be set based on mature volume costs rather than current costs for a number of years and only at the end of that\ntime began marking 10-year cost recovery. The Board concluded that doing so would result in a more efficient\npayment mechanism and was consistent with the MCA. See 46 FR 1343 (January 6, 1981).\n\n\f- 10 As described in the 2018 Notice, RTGS-based faster payment services require banks to\nhave sufficient liquidity positioned in a specified account to perform interbank settlement at any\ntime, on any day. Without sufficient liquidity so available to conduct settlement, a faster\npayment cannot be completed in an RTGS-based service where, by design, interbank settlement\noccurs before final funds can be made available to the receiver. At present, the Federal Reserve\ndoes not provide a service that would provide a means to position additional liquidity in the\nspecified account outside standard business hours. In light of these considerations, in its 2018\nNotice the Board proposed developing a liquidity management tool that could help address these\nneeds by facilitating transfers to and from other accounts held by participants at Federal Reserve\nBanks.\nIn response to the 2018 Notice, several large banks and other commenters indicated that\nthe proposed tool could help with managing liquidity in the recently established private-sector\nRTGS service for faster payments. The private-sector RTGS service is supported by funds in a\njoint account at a Reserve Bank, and the proposed liquidity management tool would enable\nmovement of funds between a joint account and banks’ reserve accounts during hours when\nexisting services are not currently open. Commenters suggested that the Federal Reserve should\nprovide this tool through expansion of operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service.\nCommenters also noted that expanded Fedwire Funds Service hours, and relatedly, NSS\nhours, could provide benefits for a variety of payment activities beyond those related to faster\npayments. Payment activity supported by expanded hours could include additional settlement\nwindows for the ACH service and wholesale payment activity in global markets. Because of the\nsystemic importance of the Fedwire Funds Service, in particular, additional risk, operational, and\n\n\f- 11 policy analysis is required for this action, and the draft notice indicates the Federal Reserve’s\nintention to engage actively with the industry to conduct this analysis.\nThe FedNow Service\nAs explained in the August announcement, the FedNow Service would conduct real-time,\npayment-by-payment, settlement of interbank obligations through debits and credits to banks’\nbalances in accounts at the Reserve Banks. Real-time settlement in accounts at the Reserve\nBanks means that settlement occurs without liquidity or credit risks, which enhances the safety\nof these payments. The FedNow Service would incorporate clearing functionality, allowing\nbanks, in the process of settling each payment, to exchange information needed to make debits\nand credits to the accounts of their customers. The service’s functionality would support banks’\n(or their agents’) provision of end-to-end faster payments to their customers.\nUltimately, the FedNow Service will provide, alongside similar private-sector services,\ncore infrastructure to promote ubiquitous, safe, and efficient faster payments in the United States.\nIn fact, for all payment systems in our country, no single private-sector provider has ever\nachieved nationwide reach on its own. With the FedNow Service, banks will now have a choice\nin providers or could choose to use both a Federal Reserve and private-sector service for back-up\npurposes, as some do today for check, ACH, and wire services.\nThe Federal Reserve recognizes that time-to-market is an important consideration\nexpressed by many commenters in response to the 2018 Notice. Our objective is to implement\nthe service as soon as practicably possible. However, the achievement of true nationwide reach\nover the long term, as opposed to initial availability of a service, is the most important measure\nof success for faster payments.\n\n\f- 12 At the same time as the Board published its decision regarding the new service, the Board\nrequested public comment on how the FedNow Service might be designed to most effectively\nsupport the full set of payment system stakeholders and the functioning of the broader U.S.\npayment system. In the same notice, the Board also announced its intention to explore the\nexpansion of Fedwire Funds Service and NSS hours, up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity\nmanagement in private-sector real-time gross settlement services for faster payments and to\nsupport a wide range of payment activities, beyond those related to faster payments.\nThe Board’s important decision to approve a new payment service comes over 40 years\nafter the last service, ACH, was approved for implementation back in the 1970s. The decision to\nestablish ACH came at a pivotal moment when the industry was overwhelmed by the volume of\npaper checks, and the new technology at that time allowed for what is essentially an electronic\nversion of paper checks. Remarkable new technology enables the Federal Reserve to support the\nfinancial sector in offering an ever-growing array of options 24x7x365 in a safe and efficient\nmanner. Providing such payment services is very much consistent with our historical role in the\npayment system, one that has helped banks to meet the needs of business and households in a\ngrowing economy for over a century.\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EDT\nSeptember 25, 2019\n\nStatement by\nEsther George\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\non behalf of\nThe Federal Reserve System\nbefore the\nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\nUnited States Senate\n\nSeptember 25, 2019\n\n\fChairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the Committee, thank you for\nthis opportunity.\nChair Powell has asked me to speak to you today in my role as the Federal Reserve Bank\nleader responsible for the Federal Reserve’s payments improvement initiative since its beginning\nand as chair of the Financial Services Policy Committee (FSPC). The FSPC oversees the\nprovision of payment services to depository institutions and the United States Treasury by the 12\nFederal Reserve Banks. I am pleased to offer my statement for the record as well as an in depth\nstatement on the role of the Federal Reserve in faster payments and the recently announced\nproposal by the Federal Reserve to support faster payments.\nOver the past decade, cell phones and other online capabilities have made it more\nconvenient to send and receive payments. Although these mobile apps appear to provide for an\nimmediate transaction, the underlying infrastructure is not designed to immediately move money\nbetween banks, creating notable delays between the initiation of a retail payment and its receipt.\nTo support the demand for real-time payments in the United States and to address this\ngap, last month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors (Board) announced that the Federal\nReserve Banks would develop a new service called the FedNow Service.\nSince its founding more than a century ago, the Federal Reserve has provided payment\nand settlement services as part of its core function of promoting an accessible, safe and efficient\npayment system for the nation. Today, the Federal Reserve is continuing this important\noperational role and preparing to support the modernization of our nation’s payment system with\ncapabilities that allow payments to move quickly through a safe and efficient foundation, on top\nof which innovation and competition can flourish.\nThis decision was made only after three established criteria were met.\n\n\f2\n\nThe first of these criteria is that it is a service that other providers alone cannot be\nexpected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope and equity.\nOf notable importance related to this criterion is the Federal Reserve’s ability to connect\nto more than 10,000 financial institutions. Through these connections, the Federal Reserve’s\nexisting payment services allow banks of every size to serve the needs of thousands of\ncommunities across the United States with competitive, fair and transparent access. Providing\nthis degree of comprehensive nationwide reach is something that we believe will present\nsignificant challenges to other providers in the current market landscape. Coming from a region\nof the country with a significant number of small community banks serving rural areas of the\ncentral United States, I can tell you the Board’s decision to provide this new service has been\nwell received.\nThe second criterion is that there will be a clear public benefit, including promoting the\nintegrity of the payments system and reducing payments system risk.\nThe Federal Reserve must continue to play an important role in promoting the safety of\nthe U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response to\nfinancial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other crises. The FedNow Service will\nallow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking\nsystem, as well as promote the development and implementation of industry-wide fraudmitigation standards. Development of the service will also enhance safety of the U.S. payment\nsystem by promoting resiliency through redundancy.\nThe final criterion is that the Federal Reserve be able to fully recover its cost over the\nlong run. The U.S. payments infrastructure today includes alternative payment choices and\nproviders. Today, the Federal Reserve and The Clearing House operate competing and\n\n\f3\n\ninteroperable services, which bring important benefits for resiliency and competition. In all of\nour services, we have been able to meet the requirements of the Monetary Control Act for cost\nrecovery that ensures competitive fairness while fulfilling our public policy goals. In this regard,\neven as we develop the FedNow Service, the Federal Reserve will continue to explore ways to\nsupport the market’s existing private-sector real-time payment service including through\nexpanded Fedwire Funds Service and National Settlement Service hours as described in the\nrecent Federal Register notice.\nAs was explained in a 2016 GAO study, the Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has\nlong been judged as effective in promoting accessibility, safety, and efficiency for the nation’s\npayment system and its customers.1, 2 Last summer, the U.S. Treasury recommended that “the\nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payments system, such as through the\ndevelopment of a real-time settlement service, that would also allow for more efficient and\nubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”3 We are engaging now with stakeholders\nfor their input on features of the FedNow Service through the Federal Register notice issued last\nmonth.\nFinally, I found it gratifying after the Federal Reserve started the conversation about\nfaster payments in the U.S. and led four years of stakeholder engagement that culminated in the\noverwhelming majority of 400 comments from industry, consumer, and small business\nexpressing support for the Federal Reserve’s role as a faster payments provider.\n\n“Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase\nAssurance of Cost Accuracy.” U.S. Government Accountability Office.

I am happy to respond to your questions.\n\n\fFaster Payments and the U.S. Payment System\nThe U.S. payment system faces a critical juncture in its evolution. Services to conduct\nfaster payments, which are available via smart phones apps or on our computers, have begun to\nemerge along with the growth of digital commerce. Faster payments allow individuals and\nbusinesses to send and receive payments within seconds, any time of day, on any day of the year,\nsuch that the receiver can use the funds almost instantly. The round-the-clock, real-time nature\nof faster payments offers convenience that is not available with many traditional ways of making\npayments. In addition, faster payments can yield real economic benefits for individuals and\nbusinesses by providing them with more flexibility to manage their money and allowing them to\nmake time-sensitive payments whenever needed.\nYet with many of the faster payment services available today, the underlying\ninfrastructure is not designed to immediately move money between banks, creating notable\ndelays between the initiation of a retail payment and its receipt. These shortcomings limit the\ndegree to which the potential benefits of faster payment services may be widely enjoyed across\nour economy in a safe manner. Further expansion of the interbank infrastructure is needed to\nserve as the foundation for the development of faster payment services that are safe, efficient,\nand broadly accessible to the American public.\nLast month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors (Board) announced that the\nFederal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) would develop a new service called the FedNowSM\nService to support widespread adoption of faster payments in the United States. The FedNow\nService will provide the necessary infrastructure, alongside similar services provided by the\nprivate sector, to connect banks across the country, allowing them to offer innovative faster\npayment services to their customers.\n\n\f-2Since its founding, the Federal Reserve has played a key operational role in the nation’s\npayment system by providing interbank payment infrastructure that is available to banks across\nthe country, regardless of size or location. This critical role, given by Congress, stems from the\nFederal Reserve’s unique ability, as the nation’s central bank, to provide interbank settlement\nwithout introducing liquidity or credit risks. In today’s payment infrastructure, whether in check\nprocessing, automated clearinghouse (ACH) services, or funds transfers, you will see a\nFederal Reserve service operating in healthy competition with and in support of similar services\nprovided by the private sector, all for the benefit of the American public.\nThe importance of this role has been recognized broadly, with an independent review by\nthe U.S. Government Accountability Office concluding that the Federal Reserve’s provision of\npayment services has benefited the U.S. payment system and its users.1 It is important to point\nout, however, that Congress did not grant plenary regulatory or supervisory authority over the\nU.S. payment system to the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve does not have regulatory\nauthority over the pricing set by a private-sector system or to require a private-sector system to\nextend the service to banks of all sizes. In some other countries, central banks have been\nassigned the responsibility for regulating payment systems. In the United States, this is not the\ncase. Thus, the Federal Reserve has historically helped to promote the accessibility, safety, and\nefficiency of the nation’s payment system and advance innovations through its operational role\nas provider of payment and settlement services.\n\nSee U.S. Government Accountability Office, GAO-16-614, “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers\nBenefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase Assurance of Cost Accuracy” (2016). Available at\nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-614.\n1\n\n\f-3Path to Present\nLeading up to the recent FedNow Service decision and announcement in August, the\nFederal Reserve took several actions to facilitate the advancement of faster payments in the\nUnited States. In 2013, the Federal Reserve began a collaborative initiative with industry\nstakeholders to foster improvements to the nation’s payment system. As part of this initiative,\nthe Federal Reserve convened in 2015 the Faster Payments Task Force (FPTF), comprising a\nwide range of industry stakeholders, to identify and evaluate alternative approaches for\nimplementing safe and ubiquitous faster payment capabilities in the United States.\nThe FPTF published in 2017 a set of consensus recommendations focused on actions to\nsupport improvements to the nation’s payment system.2 Among the FPTF’s recommendations\nwere requests for the Federal Reserve (1) to develop a 24x7x365 settlement service to support\nfaster payments and (2) to explore and assess the need for other Federal Reserve operational\nrole(s) in faster payments. Subsequently, the U.S. Department of the Treasury recommended\nthat “the Federal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payments system, such as\nthrough the development of a real-time settlement service, that would also allow for more\nefficient and ubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”3\n\nThese recommendations were intended to help achieve the FPTF’s vision of ubiquitous faster payment capabilities\nin the United States that would allow any end user (that is, an individual or business) to safely, efficiently, and\nseamlessly send a faster payment to any other end user, no matter which banks or payment services they use. See\nFaster Payments Task Force, “Final Report Part Two: A Call to Action,” (July 2017). Available at\nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/faster-payments-task-force-final-report-part-two.pdf.\n2\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury also noted that “[i]n particular, smaller financial institutions, like community\nbanks and credit unions, should also have the ability to access the most-innovative technologies and payment\nservices. While Treasury believes that a payment system led by the private sector has the potential to be at the\nforefront of innovation and allow for the most advanced payment system in the world, back-end Federal Reserve\npayment services must also be appropriately enhanced to enable innovations.” U.S. Treasury, “A Financial System\nThat Creates Economic Opportunity: Nonbank Financials, Fintech, and Innovation,” (July 2018) at 156. Available\nat https://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018-07/A-Financial-System-that-Creates-Economic-Opportunities--Nonbank-Financi.pdf.\n3\n\n\f-4The Federal Reserve also has directly supported the development of private-sector realtime gross settlement (RTGS) services for faster payments. The Board approved in 2017 final\nguidelines for evaluating requests for joint accounts at the Reserve Banks intended to facilitate\nsettlement between and among banks participating in private-sector payment systems for faster\npayments.4 The impetus for allowing broader use of joint accounts was to support these privatesector arrangements.\nIn November 2018, the Board published a Federal Register notice (2018 Notice)\nrequesting comment on two potential actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve\nconsistent with the FPTF recommendations: (1) a service for 24x7x365 real-time interbank\nsettlement of faster payments; and (2) a liquidity management tool that would enable transfers\nbetween accounts held at Reserve Banks on a 24x7x365 basis to support services for real-time\ninterbank settlement of faster payments.\nThe Board explained that a Federal Reserve RTGS service for faster payments, alongside\nprivate-sector RTGS services, would provide the infrastructure needed to achieve ubiquitous,\nsafe, and efficient faster payments in the United States. Other parties, such as banks, payment\nprocessors, and providers of payment services, could utilize this platform as a basis for\ninnovation to meet the specific needs of the businesses and households they serve. The Board\nfurther explained that a liquidity management tool, in turn, could help alleviate liquidity\nmanagement issues for banks engaged in RTGS-based faster payments, notably those utilizing\nsettlement services offered by the private sector. In particular, such a tool would enable\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Guidelines for Evaluating Joint Account Requests,” (Issued\n2017). Available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/joint_requests.htm. In 2016, Federal Reserve\nstaff received a request from a private-sector service provider to open a new joint account for that organization’s\nproposed faster payment system. The use of a joint account at a Reserve Bank to support settlement mitigates\ncertain risks by reproducing, as closely as possible, the risk-free nature of settlement in central bank money.\n4\n\n\f-5movement of funds between accounts at the Reserve Banks during hours when traditional\npayment and settlement services are currently not open to allow liquidity to be moved, when\nneeded, to an account or accounts used to support real-time settlement of faster payments. The\n2018 Notice proposed that the tool could be provided by expanding operating hours of current\nFederal Reserve services or through a new service.\nIn the 2018 Notice, the Board requested comment on the appropriateness of real-time\ngross settlement as the strategic foundation for faster payments in the United States and the\npublic benefits, implications, and challenges of the Federal Reserve taking either, both, or neither\nof the potential actions.\nConsideration of Comments and Policy Assessment\nThe Board received over 400 comment letters representing over 800 entities in response\nto the 2018 Notice. Comments were submitted by a wide variety of stakeholders in the U.S.\npayment system, including community banks, individuals, consumer organizations, merchants,\nservice providers, private-sector operators, fintech companies, trade organizations, and other\ninterested parties.5 Consistent with the diversity of the payment industry, commenters\nrepresented a broad range of viewpoints.\nAlmost all commenters addressed the question of whether the Federal Reserve should\ndevelop a real-time interbank settlement service for faster payments. The vast majority of these\ncommenters, representing nearly every stakeholder segment, supported the Federal Reserve\n\n5\n\nOverall, banks were the largest group of respondents, with community banks (small and midsize banks)\ncomprising approximately 60 percent of the total comments—the largest specific segment—and representing\ninstitutions from 34 states.\n\n\f-6taking this action. In contrast, large banks, some trade organizations, and private-sector\noperators were generally not supportive of the Federal Reserve developing such a service.6\nIn reaching its decision to offer the FedNow Service, the Board was informed by these\npublic comments and the history of the U.S. payment system, in which the Federal Reserve has\nplayed a role since its inception. In addition, any decision by the Board to offer a new payment\nservice is subject to the factors set out in longstanding Federal Reserve policy, and the pricing of\nReserve Bank services is subject to the requirements of the Monetary Control Act of 1980.7\nSpecifically, in considering new services, the Board assesses three criteria: whether the service is\none that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness,\nscope, and equity; whether the service will yield a clear public benefit; and whether the\nFederal Reserve will achieve full cost recovery over the long run.8\nOther Providers Criterion\nThrough this assessment, the Board has concluded that other providers alone cannot be\nexpected to provide an RTGS infrastructure for faster payments with reasonable effectiveness,\nscope, and equity. So far, only one private-sector RTGS service for faster payments has been\nestablished in the United States. Due to coordination challenges and the high fixed costs\nnecessary to develop a new payment and settlement service, this service is expected to remain\nthe sole private-sector RTGS service for faster payments in the United States. The ability of a\n\n6\n\nApproximately half of the commenters discussed the liquidity management tool, with almost all supporting the\nFederal Reserve offering such a tool.\n7\nIn 1984, the Board established criteria for the consideration of new or enhanced Federal Reserve payment services\nin its policy The Federal Reserve in the Payment System. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “The\nFederal Reserve in the Payments System,” (Issued 1984; revised 1990). Available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/pfs_frpaysys.htm.\n8\nIn addition, the Board performs a competitive impact analysis when considering an operational or legal change to a\nReserve Bank service or price that would have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other providers\nof services to compete with the Reserve Banks.\n\n\f-7sole private-sector provider to extend access to a few thousand banks, let alone the more than\n10,000 diverse banks necessary to achieve true nationwide scope, would be costly and timeconsuming given that the existing service has limited relationships with and connections to these\ninstitutions.\nIn addition, the Board concluded that the private-sector operator alone cannot be\nexpected to provide the service with reasonable effectiveness, as viewed through the lenses of\nsafety and efficiency. From a safety perspective, a sole provider may serve as a single point of\nfailure in the market for RTGS-based faster payments. From an efficiency perspective, a market\nwith only a single operator may cause challenges related to competition, innovation, and market\nfragmentation. According to established economic theory and experience from other markets, a\nsingle service provider not facing competition can yield undesirable outcomes, such as higher\nprices or lower service quality. Such undesirable outcomes could limit adoption of faster\npayments by end users, which could in turn curtail efficiency benefits to the broader economy.\nPublic Benefits Criterion\nThe Board also determined that the FedNow Service will yield a clear public benefit.\nSince its inception, an underlying public policy rationale for the Federal Reserve’s involvement\nin the payment system has been to provide services in a safe and efficient manner to banks\nnationwide. Because of this long-standing policy commitment, the Federal Reserve has\nhistorically extended access to banks of all sizes, including smaller banks in rural and remote\nareas of the country. The Federal Reserve’s relationships with and connections to thousands of\nbanks across the country provide a solid foundation for the FedNow Service to facilitate those\nbanks gaining access to an RTGS infrastructure for faster payments, which would benefit small\nand midsize banks and the communities they serve.\n\n\f-8In a payment system with multiple operators, banks would have a choice whether to join\na single service or multiple services. An RTGS infrastructure could, therefore, achieve\nnationwide reach in two main ways, either through interoperability via direct exchange of\npayments between operators, such as in the U.S. ACH system, or through at least one service\nconnecting to virtually all banks, such as in the funds transfer system.\nThe FedNow Service would promote payment system safety in multiple ways. As noted\nby commenters, the Federal Reserve has historically played an important role in promoting the\nsafety of the U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response\nto financial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other crises. As the prominence of\nfaster payments in the United States grows, the development of the FedNow Service would allow\nthe Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking system and\nthe broader economy in times of crisis. In addition, as the operator of the service, the\nFederal Reserve would be in a position to promote the development and implementation of\nindustry-wide fraud-mitigation standards, which commenters highlighted are especially\nimportant for real-time payments. The development of the service could also enhance the safety\nof the U.S. payment system by promoting resiliency through redundancy.\nFinally, the FedNow Service could provide efficiency benefits by serving as a platform\nfor innovation and the development of end-user services by the private sector. In addition, an\nRTGS infrastructure with nationwide reach would make the development of new faster payment\nservices based on real-time settlement more attractive, increasing innovation and competition in\nthe market for end-user faster payment services. Such competition could yield efficiency\nbenefits by leading to lower prices and higher service quality.\n\n\f-9Cost Recovery Criterion\nThe Board expects that the FedNow Service will achieve full recovery of costs over\nthe long run. The MCA requirement to require cost recovery “over the long run” is not\nassociated with a specific timeframe. Beginning in 1995, the Board adopted a convention\nof evaluating long-run cost recovery for existing services using a rolling 10-year period. At\nthat time, Federal Reserve services were in mature states, characterized by widespread\nadoption by banks of all sizes throughout the country, with relatively stable volumes and\ncosts. At other times, notably as the ACH service was evolving, the Board considered long\nrun over an extended time period in order to encourage the adoption of electronic payments\nfor the benefit of the economy.9\nGiven the time frame necessary to create a broad network of banks connecting to the\nservice, the Board determined that a longer time frame for cost recovery is consistent with\nthe intent of the MCA to encourage the adoption of new services that have the potential to\nbring widespread economic benefits to the country.\nExpanded Hours for Existing Services\nThe second proposed action in the 2018 Notice entailed the exploration of the expansion\nof operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service, which is our existing funds transfer service,\nand National Settlement Service (NSS) hours, which is our service that supports private-sector\nnet settlement arrangements, potentially up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity management,\nnotably for users of private-sector RTGS services.\n\n9\n\nACH began as a Federal Reserve service in the 1970s, prior to the passage of the MCA. In 1981, when the pricing\nprinciples were first applied to ACH, the Board recognized that the ACH service was still evolving and allowed fees\nto be set based on mature volume costs rather than current costs for a number of years and only at the end of that\ntime began marking 10-year cost recovery. The Board concluded that doing so would result in a more efficient\npayment mechanism and was consistent with the MCA. See 46 FR 1343 (January 6, 1981).\n\n\f- 10 As described in the 2018 Notice, RTGS-based faster payment services require banks to\nhave sufficient liquidity positioned in a specified account to perform interbank settlement at any\ntime, on any day. Without sufficient liquidity so available to conduct settlement, a faster\npayment cannot be completed in an RTGS-based service where, by design, interbank settlement\noccurs before final funds can be made available to the receiver. At present, the Federal Reserve\ndoes not provide a service that would provide a means to position additional liquidity in the\nspecified account outside standard business hours. In light of these considerations, in its 2018\nNotice the Board proposed developing a liquidity management tool that could help address these\nneeds by facilitating transfers to and from other accounts held by participants at Federal Reserve\nBanks.\nIn response to the 2018 Notice, several large banks and other commenters indicated that\nthe proposed tool could help with managing liquidity in the recently established private-sector\nRTGS service for faster payments. The private-sector RTGS service is supported by funds in a\njoint account at a Reserve Bank, and the proposed liquidity management tool would enable\nmovement of funds between a joint account and banks’ reserve accounts during hours when\nexisting services are not currently open. Commenters suggested that the Federal Reserve should\nprovide this tool through expansion of operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service.\nCommenters also noted that expanded Fedwire Funds Service hours, and relatedly, NSS\nhours, could provide benefits for a variety of payment activities beyond those related to faster\npayments. Payment activity supported by expanded hours could include additional settlement\nwindows for the ACH service and wholesale payment activity in global markets. Because of the\nsystemic importance of the Fedwire Funds Service, in particular, additional risk, operational, and\n\n\f- 11 policy analysis is required for this action, and the draft notice indicates the Federal Reserve’s\nintention to engage actively with the industry to conduct this analysis.\nThe FedNow Service\nAs explained in the August announcement, the FedNow Service would conduct real-time,\npayment-by-payment, settlement of interbank obligations through debits and credits to banks’\nbalances in accounts at the Reserve Banks. Real-time settlement in accounts at the Reserve\nBanks means that settlement occurs without liquidity or credit risks, which enhances the safety\nof these payments. The FedNow Service would incorporate clearing functionality, allowing\nbanks, in the process of settling each payment, to exchange information needed to make debits\nand credits to the accounts of their customers. The service’s functionality would support banks’\n(or their agents’) provision of end-to-end faster payments to their customers.\nUltimately, the FedNow Service will provide, alongside similar private-sector services,\ncore infrastructure to promote ubiquitous, safe, and efficient faster payments in the United States.\nIn fact, for all payment systems in our country, no single private-sector provider has ever\nachieved nationwide reach on its own. With the FedNow Service, banks will now have a choice\nin providers or could choose to use both a Federal Reserve and private-sector service for back-up\npurposes, as some do today for check, ACH, and wire services.\nThe Federal Reserve recognizes that time-to-market is an important consideration\nexpressed by many commenters in response to the 2018 Notice. Our objective is to implement\nthe service as soon as practicably possible. However, the achievement of true nationwide reach\nover the long term, as opposed to initial availability of a service, is the most important measure\nof success for faster payments.\n\n\f- 12 At the same time as the Board published its decision regarding the new service, the Board\nrequested public comment on how the FedNow Service might be designed to most effectively\nsupport the full set of payment system stakeholders and the functioning of the broader U.S.\npayment system. In the same notice, the Board also announced its intention to explore the\nexpansion of Fedwire Funds Service and NSS hours, up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity\nmanagement in private-sector real-time gross settlement services for faster payments and to\nsupport a wide range of payment activities, beyond those related to faster payments.\nThe Board’s important decision to approve a new payment service comes over 40 years\nafter the last service, ACH, was approved for implementation back in the 1970s. The decision to\nestablish ACH came at a pivotal moment when the industry was overwhelmed by the volume of\npaper checks, and the new technology at that time allowed for what is essentially an electronic\nversion of paper checks. Remarkable new technology enables the Federal Reserve to support the\nfinancial sector in offering an ever-growing array of options 24x7x365 in a safe and efficient\nmanner. Providing such payment services is very much consistent with our historical role in the\npayment system, one that has helped banks to meet the needs of business and households in a\ngrowing economy for over a century.\n\n\f"

            "content": "Opening Remarks by Esther L. George\nAt the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium,\n“Challenges for Monetary Policy”\nAugust 22, 2019\n\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to beautiful Jackson Hole, Wyoming and to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s economic symposium titled “Challenges\nfor Monetary Policy.”\n\nI am pleased to be joined by Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, as well as\nmany of my current and former colleagues from the Federal Reserve; and by other\ncentral bankers, academics, and policymakers from around the globe.\nThis year marks the 43rd economic symposium, and with its long history comes an\nassociation with many distinguished individuals. Sadly, we lost two such\nindividuals this year, both of whom were significant contributors to the discussion\nin Jackson Hole. And because of that, I want to take a moment to remember Alan\nKrueger and Marty Feldstein for their important contributions and for their\nfriendship.\n\nAlan Krueger joined us at several symposiums both as chair of the Council of\nEconomic Advisers and as a professor at Princeton University. He was always a\ngracious and thoughtful participant. Those who were with us here last year will\nrecall that Alan was the featured luncheon speaker and offered keen insights on\nchanges in worker bargaining power and implications for monetary policy.\n\n\fMarty and Kate Feldstein attended many symposiums here, and Marty was on the\nprogram some 18 times. His influential contributions to the economics profession\nand to public service will long be remembered. He was a wonderful mentor and\nwe are grateful for his advice and input over the years as we considered topics and\nspeakers for this program.\n\nAlan Krueger and Marty Feldstein were exceptional in many ways, and both of\nthem will be greatly missed.\nAs we considered the topic for this year’s symposium, we were mindful that a\ndecade beyond the global financial crisis, central bankers face a range of\nchallenges as they pursue their mandates. Differences in economic conditions\nacross countries have contributed to a divergence in policy paths with implications\nfor exchange rates, trade, and ultimately economic activity. The buildup and\neventual unwinding of balance sheet policies have implications for capital markets\nand financial flows between countries. And as central banks have looked to\nnormalize policy settings, the prospect of lower neutral rates of interest has\nemerged across the globe. While charting a course to pursue their mandates under\nthese circumstances, central banks also must take into account the influences of\ncommodity and financial markets.\nWithout question, it’s a complex ecosystem in which central bankers seek an\nequilibrium. And our setting here in the Grand Teton National Park is perhaps the\nideal place to contemplate such challenges given the very complex natural\necosystem that exists here.\n\n\fYou will find that the national park is home to a variety of species – elk, moose,\nbison, and grizzly bears to name a few. These animals co-exist in an equilibrium\nthat provides mutual benefits when they respect each other’s territory. As the park\nrangers will tell you, some of these animals establish large territories referred to as\nhome ranges. When the home ranges of different animals overlap, or one animal\nintrudes on another’s territory, things get a little more interesting. That said, the\npark rangers assure me that such encounters or even aggression are generally\nresolved without bloodshed, typically with retreat of the intruder.\n\nWe also know that natural ecosystems are quite sensitive to change and restoring\nthe equilibrium after a disruption can prove challenging. Earlier this week, I\nattended a talk hosted here at the Jackson Lake Lodge that also may provide\nlessons for the ecosystem in which central bankers operate. In this talk, the speaker\nreviewed the history of Grizzly bears in Yellowstone. He explained that, as the\nrailroad was constructed across Wyoming in the 1800s, hotels began to spring up\nto provide accommodations for travelers.\n\nAfter serving meals, the hotel kitchens would toss out the scraps a short distance\nfrom the kitchen door, which as you might imagine, eventually attracted the grizzly\nbears. As it turned out, the tourists quite enjoyed watching the bears feed and at\nfirst, it seemed harmless, even beneficial – but there were unintended\nconsequences. The bears began to prefer this new source of food to the detriment\nof their health and the safety of the tourists. Eventually, the park service put a stop\nto this practice with a difficult transition to a new equilibrium – getting the\ngrizzlies to return to their natural diet. And to preserve the restored equilibrium,\nyou will find today clearly posted across the national park a very familiar sign: Do\nnot feed the bears.\n\n\fWhether or not central bankers can actually draw any lessons from this natural\necosystem, I highly recommend while you’re here that you do not feed the bears\nand avoid encounters with them while hiking in their territory.\nAgain, thank you for coming, and I look forward to the presentations and\ndiscussions of the excellent papers prepared for this year’s program and the\ninsights from all of you on the challenges for monetary policy.\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJuly 12, 2019\nLooking Back and Looking Forward: How Do We Preserve Monetary and Financial Stability?\nThe Central Bank of Iceland\nReykjavik, Iceland\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fGood afternoon. I want to thank the organizers and, in particular, Már and the Central\nBank of Iceland for inviting me to participate in this program. It is timely to consider the lessons\nlooking back and to continue to do the hard work of implementing needed change to secure and\npreserve monetary and financial stability. Preserving that stability is especially important today\nas central banks work within more limited policy space and, to varying degrees, under challenges\nto independence.\nThis month marks the tenth year of expansion of the U.S. economy, now the longest\neconomic expansion in its history. This long period of expansion has been one of generally\nmoderate growth, but also a period during which the stance of monetary policy remained\naccommodative for many years, only recently approaching what appears to be a neutral level.\nThe unemployment rate, currently at 3.7 percent, remains below most assessments of its long-run\nnatural level and stands in stark contrast to its peak of 10 percent nearly a decade ago. Inflation\nhas remained low and relatively stable throughout this period even as labor markets tightened,\nwages moved higher and domestic demand grew. After years of accommodative policy, the U.S.\neconomy appears to be performing reasonably well notwithstanding the emerging downside risks\ncoming from slower global growth and trade policy uncertainty. Even as the U.S. economy has\nachieved a degree of stability, the prolonged low rate environment accompanied by\nunconventional policy has increased risk appetites and influenced asset values. And signs of\nfinancial imbalances are growing, while capital in the nation’s largest banking organizations is\nnot.\nSecuring economic and financial stability for the long-run health of the macroeconomy\nrequires balancing monetary policy calibration with an understanding of potential vulnerabilities\nin the financial system. This remains a focus in the United States. My comments today will look\n\n1\n\n\fat the nature of current financial vulnerabilities and the challenges I see associated with\nresponding to those vulnerabilities at this stage of the expansion.\n\nThe Expanded Regulatory Toolkit\nFollowing the 2008-09 financial crisis, massive regulatory change came from legislation\nknown as the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and revamped supervisory approaches and keener attention\nto financial stability. Among improvements in U.S. bank regulatory policy and the tools\nimplemented to evaluate and promote financial stability, the supervisory stress tests have been a\nkey innovation for assessing the level of capital in the banking system. This analytical exercise\nprovides a quantitative and comprehensive process for evaluating the sufficiency of an individual\nbank’s capital, as well as aggregate levels of capital in the system, to offset losses that stem from\na simulated stress environment. In addition to stress testing, regulatory capital requirements for\nthe largest banks have been strengthened through more rigorous risk-weighting approaches and\nincreased leverage capital requirements. To address cyclical concerns about financial stability\nrisk, the Federal Reserve now has the authority to impose a countercyclical capital buffer\n(CCyB) requirement on the largest banks. On the other hand, its authorities related to its role as\nlender of last resort were constrained.\nRegulatory changes for the largest banks also have improved their liquidity cushions.\nThese firms now hold a larger amount of high-quality liquid assets and must routinely\ndemonstrate their ability to meet short-term liquidity demands. Efforts are underway to develop\nrequirements to address longer-term liquidity risk.\nIn addition, U.S. regulators implemented structural reforms in derivatives markets,\nincluding promotion of central clearing and swap execution facilities, margin requirements,\n\n2\n\n\fimproved reporting, and bank capital rules for derivatives. Money market mutual fund\nregulations were implemented to reduce run risk in these funds. Finally, the Financial Stability\nOversight Council was formed along with the Office of Financial Research.\nTaken together, these changes undoubtedly have improved the overall health and\nresiliency of the U.S. financial system. Whether these steps will prove robust to a future shock\nhowever has yet to be tested.\n\nIdentifying Vulnerabilities\nIdentifying vulnerabilities has taken on renewed focus. To that end, the Federal Reserve\npublishes its assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the economy twice each year. The\nframework used by the Fed looks at vulnerabilities across four dimensions: 1) asset valuations;\n2) household and business debt; 3) leverage in the financial sector; and 4) funding risks.\nThe most recent financial stability report highlights a variety of risks and vulnerabilities.\nAmong them, for example, corporate leverage in the United States has grown rapidly and is at a\nrecord level. The amount of outstanding debt among the corporate sector in the United States has\ngrown to an unprecedented amount during the long expansionary period. Non-financial\ncorporations now have approximately $6 trillion in outstanding debt, roughly twice the amount\nof debt outstanding at the beginning of the expansion. Much of the growth in corporate debt\noutstanding is due to borrowing by firms that were already highly leveraged.\nThe ratings for many of these corporate bonds are at the margin of investment grade and\nare at risk of being downgraded if economic conditions were to deteriorate. In addition, the\nstandards for leveraged corporate loans have declined steadily in recent years as loan structures\nand covenants have weakened.\n\n3\n\n\fWith much of the recent growth in leveraged borrowing funded by non-bank lenders,\nvulnerabilities that originate outside the banking sector could pose substantial challenges for both\nthe macroeconomy and U.S. banks during times of financial stress. Close links between the\ntraditional banking sector and the so-called shadow banking sector are evident, but not wellunderstood. However, disruptions in the corporate debt markets are likely to flow through these\nlinks and raise demands for short-term funding from banks during a period of market stress. A\ndecline in investor demand for corporate debt could also create loan syndicate pipeline risk and\ndownward pressure on values that would have adverse impacts on banks. More broadly, a\ndisruption in corporate debt markets could cause broader spillover effects on other assets classes,\nwhere values are currently elevated, adversely impacting overall bank health and the\nmacroeconomy. For this reason, a focus on the stability of the banking system is essential.\nIdentifying risks is clearly important. Equally important is understanding what tools are\nat our disposal to address such concerns. In the case of the United States, this is very much a\nwork in progress.\nIn my view, monetary policy settings are not well suited to react, notwithstanding the\neffect it may have in influencing the conditions around risk and investor’s reach for yield. And, it\nseems to me, macroprudential approaches are desirable in theory but face considerable challenge\naround the age-old issues of being delivered timely and potently, at least in the United States’\nexperience. Other countries have different macroprudential loan-to-value measures to use.\nWithin the Federal Reserve, a number of my colleagues and I participated in a tabletop\nexercise a few years ago. The exercise was designed to assess the efficacy of certain\nmacroprudential tools in responding to a hypothetical financial crisis. In the exercise, we\nexamined the use of capital-based, liquidity-based, and credit-based tools, along with stress\n\n4\n\n\ftesting and supervisory guidance in mitigating the effects of an overheating of the financial\nmarkets. What we discovered in conducting the exercise was that the effectiveness of the tools\nvaried because of realities like implementation lags and/or limited scope. Clearly, this particular\nexercise is not conclusive in all scenarios, but it cautions against becoming overly confident in\nrelying on macroprudential tools to address growing financial imbalances.1\nI’d like to mention two potential macroprudential approaches in play: the CCyB and\nstress testing.\nThe CCyB, as I noted earlier, is a new authority granted the Federal Reserve postfinancial crisis. Based on the framework approved by the Federal Reserve Board in 2016, the\nCCyB is designed to be implemented while economic growth is healthy, bank profitability is\nrising and financial stability risks are “contained, but above normal.”\nBased on the Federal Reserve Board’s assessment, the CCyB has not been deployed and\nremains at zero, concluding that financial risk is not meaningfully above normal.\nA second tool, stress testing, has been considered. The supervisory stress tests have been\nviewed as a more dynamic method for evaluating capital against vulnerabilities. Stress tests are\nforward looking, and by choosing adverse scenarios carefully, the tests can be used to measure\nexposure to specific risks, such as those associated with real estate or rapidly growing corporate\nleverage. While the stress testing exercise has been a useful tool to gauge bank capitalization and\npromote safety and soundness, the underlying assumptions are subject to certain limitations. All\nmodel results have some degree of uncertainty, especially when the current vulnerabilities, such\nas in leveraged corporate debt, represent uncharted territory. Stress test results need to be\ninterpreted carefully and used among other indicators of resiliency.\n\nTobias Adrian, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “Macro-prudential Policy: A Case Study\nfrom a Tabletop Exercise,” FRBNY Economic Policy Review, February 2017.\n1\n\n5\n\n\fSome have argued that stress tests are counter-cyclical in that more stringent scenarios\ncreated during good times encourage (even require) banks to build capital during periods of\neconomic growth, thereby preparing for future downturns. I find little evidence that stress tests\nhave done this. The latest results of the Federal Reserve stress tests that were released last month\nconcluded all have sufficient capital and all were permitted to proceed with capital distribution\nand stock buybacks. Despite continued economic growth, actual capital ratios on a consolidated\nbasis for the largest banking organizations have not increased in recent years.2 Instead,\nSupplementary Leverage Ratios (SLRs) have declined in recent years. In addition, recent\nresearch has shown that the stress tests have not required banks to build capital.3 After\ndistributions and stock buybacks, the losses (declines in capital) in stress scenarios have been\nsmaller over the last few years. Banks only need to add capital (or reduce capital distributions)\nwhen losses push projected capital ratios below required minimums. These results suggest that\nstress tests cannot be relied upon to make banks build capital as we progress through the\neconomic cycle. The prospect of the stress tests not having the desired counter-cyclical outcomes\nshould have the attention of bank regulators and supervisors against a backdrop of increasing\nvulnerabilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the larger “advanced approaches” banking organizations, the average Tier 1 leverage ratio declined from 9.0\npercent at December 2016 to 8.7 percent at December 2017 to 8.5 percent at December 2018.\n3\nBerrospide, Jose, Andrew Cohen, Ronel Elul, David Hou, Aytek Malkhozov, Marc Rodriguez, and Robert Sarama\n(2019). \"Cyclicality and the Severity of the U.S. Supervisory Stress Test: 2014 to 2018,\" FEDS Notes. Washington:\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 7, 2019, https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2393.\n2\n\n6\n\n\fLooking back, the lessons of the financial crisis should remain in front of us. They were\ncostly to learn.\nEven as we work to develop the most effective macroprudential tools, we must take to\nheart the important lesson of bank capital as the single most important element in our framework\nfor financial stability. It serves as a buffer. Whether or not our judgments about the size or scope\nor timing of risk is properly judged, higher capitalized banks have been shown to lend through\nthe cycle at a higher rate than those with lower capital and are much less likely to fail.\nIf we are to secure economic financial stability for the future, building stronger capital is\nessential.\n\n7\n\n\f"

It is an honor to join with these\nexperts who bring insight to both the challenges and opportunities we are going to face with an\naging population.\nCertainly, demographic trends are reshaping the U.S. labor force, and it is leading\neconomists and policymakers to rethink the key macroeconomic parameters that drive our\ndecision making. Monetary policymakers, like myself, have had to reassess their views about\nthe economy’s longer-run growth potential, the natural rate of unemployment, and how we think\nabout interest rates.\nLike melting glaciers, the changes in global demographic trends are often difficult to see\nin the near term, but over time they will reshape the landscape. Looking over the past quarter\ncentury at the U.S. economy, structural changes have only gradually reduced the economy’s\npotential growth rate, its natural rate of interest, and unemployment, but they must be considered\nin the context of how we respond to business cycle fluctuations and potentially underlying\ninflation.\nI’d like to make three brief observations about these demographic trends affecting the\nlabor force’s composition, the job market, and the housing market. Then I will briefly describe\nsome of the challenges monetary policymakers face as they confront these trends.\n\nLong-Term Trends in the Composition of the U.S. Labor Force\nFirst, the age of the labor force in the United States has changed significantly over the\npast 25 years. The share of older individuals (age 55 and up) in the labor force has continued to\n\n1\n\n\fincrease. Twenty-five years ago, older individuals made up roughly 10 percent of the workforce;\ntoday, that share has more than doubled to over 20 percent. At the same time, the shares of\nprime-age (age 25 to 54) and young individuals (age 16 to 24) in the labor force have declined.\nThese demographic factors, particularly the increasing share of the older so-called baby-boom\ngeneration that are retiring, continue to put downward pressure on labor force participation.\nStarting in the last recession, we saw that labor force participation rates declined steadily.\nOver the past five years, the participation rate has stabilized as market conditions have improved\nand boosted participation enough to offset some of the downward pull from an aging population.\nOne of the important implications of these long-term demographic changes relevant for\npolicymakers is related to what is known as the trend unemployment rate. The unemployment\nrate tells you something about the health of the labor market today, but where it stands in relation\nto what we think of as a natural rate – or a trend unemployment rate – is far more informative for\npolicymakers. Research by my own staff at the Kansas City Fed shows that the changes in the\nage and skill composition of the labor force have systematically lowered the trend\nunemployment rate over the past 25 years.1\nAs these estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have declined, the scope for\nmonetary policy to foster lower rates of unemployment without generating inflationary pressures\nhas increased. Of course uncertainty about exactly where those natural rates of unemployment\nmight currently lie requires us to be cautious, examine a wide range of information and\ncontinually update the parameters we use as new data arrive.\n\n1\n\nTüzemen, Didem. \"Job polarization and the natural rate of unemployment in the United\nStates.\" Economics Letters, 175 (2019): 97-100.\n\n2\n\n\fJob Polarization\nMy second observation is that this shift in the composition of the labor force to older\nworkers has coincided with dramatic changes in skills demanded by employers. This change,\ndue to technological advancements, has resulted in a phenomenon known as job polarization.\nMore specifically, job opportunities have shifted away from middle-skill occupations that lead to\na middle-class standard of living and toward high- and low-skill occupations.\nSkills demanded in the labor market are rapidly changing, and technological\nadvancement has rendered the skills of many less-educated workers obsolete. As we’ve\nwitnessed in the U.S., this lack of job opportunity, in turn, may lead to depression and illness\namong displaced workers, and these health conditions may become further barriers to their\nemployment. Equipping workers with the new skills employers are demanding in the face of\nrapid technological advancements continues to be a key issue for labor force participation and\npolicymakers.\n\nDemographic Forces and the Housing Outlook\nFinally, my third observation relates to how these demographic forces are interacting\nwith, and influencing the outlook for, key sectors of the U.S. economy. In the housing sector, for\nexample, a combination of forces has resulted in high levels of housing prices and rents. These\nhigh prices disproportionately impact younger adults, and as a consequence younger adults are\ndelaying forming their own households. For example, the share of adults in their late twenties\nthrough late thirties living with their parents has increased steadily. This delayed household\nformation is also likely contributing to young adults delaying marriage and having children.\n\n3\n\n\fLooking forward, downsizing by baby boomers could significantly increase demand for\nnew multifamily construction, especially in metropolitan suburbs. This downsizing, together\nwith the mortality associated with age, would be expected to free up existing single-family\nhomes for re-occupancy. Younger households who move into these homes from rental units will\nin turn free up multifamily units for newly forming households.\nWith housing being a key fulcrum of monetary policy and a sector we know can be prone\nto boom and bust cycles, these developments will require careful monitoring.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nThis brings me to the implications of demographic change and other key structural\neconomic relationships for monetary policy. We have already seen this play out at the Federal\nOpen Market Committee in terms of revisiting our estimates of economic parameters. For\nexample, according to the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections, popularly\nreferred to as the “dot plot,” the median projection for the long-run growth rate of real GDP has\ncome down, the median projection for the long-run unemployment rate has also fallen\ndramatically and the median projection for the long-run interest rates has come down notably.\nUnderstanding of course that considerable uncertainty remains around these estimates,\npolicymakers must remain attuned to changes in macroeconomic trends such as aging\ndemographics if we are to achieve our objectives for the economy.\n\n4\n\n\f"

            "content": "Is Low Inflation a Problem for the United States?\n\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMay 14, 2019\nEconomic Club of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, Minn.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you. I’m delighted to be here.\nMy remarks today will focus on a question that garners a great deal of attention for those\nwho follow Fed policy. It is a question about whether the current level of inflation is too low. Of\ncourse, understanding the drivers of inflation dynamics is an essential part of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee’s (FOMC) work.\nAs central banks have done in other countries, the Federal Reserve announced last\nNovember its plans to review its monetary policy strategy, tools and communications practices.\nThis review strikes me as appropriate given the changes that occur over time in our economy, but\nit may be especially important now in a low interest rate environment. I look forward to the ideas\nthat may come forward as part of this review, even as I offer a few preliminary thoughts of my\nown today on the Federal Reserve’s price stability mandate, and the FOMC’s inflation objective\nand policy strategies. Before I do that, I’ll begin with my views on the economic outlook for the\nnation and monetary policy settings.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nLast year, the U.S. economy enjoyed robust growth boosted by accommodative monetary\nand fiscal policies. As the stimulus from these policies wanes, and with slower foreign growth, I\nexpect to see a slower pace of growth – somewhere in the neighborhood of the economy’s\nlonger-run trend of roughly 2 percent.\nAs you know, real gross domestic product (GDP) – our broadest, if not the timeliest,\nmeasure of economic activity – came in at a stronger-than-expected annual growth rate of 3.2\npercent in the first quarter. However, beneath this robust headline number, real final sales to\ndomestic purchasers grew at a more modest 1.3 percent rate – a clear slowing from its pace in\n\n1\n\n\frecent years. In contrast, inventory investment and net exports contributed a combined 1.7\npercentage points to overall growth. Inventories and net exports are volatile and difficult to\npredict. Based on this underlying data, I would expect to see less contribution from these sectors\nin coming quarters and a greater contribution from domestic final sales.\nMy outlook for continued but somewhat more moderate growth is tied to expectations\nthat job gains, wage increases and consumer confidence will remain supportive of consumer\nspending. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 263,000 in April after increasing\n189,000 in March. Over the last three months, job gains have averaged 169,000 per month, well\nabove the estimated number required to keep the unemployment rate steady. As a result, we\nhave seen a further decline in the unemployment rate to 3.6 percent in April, the lowest rate since\nDecember 1969.\nAs the job market has tightened, labor compensation has steadily accelerated. Average\nhourly earnings have climbed from an annual growth rate of roughly 2½ percent in 2017 to 3\npercent last year, and 3.3 percent in the first quarter of this year. With low rates of inflation,\nworkers are beginning to see significant gains in real wages. Although consumer confidence was\nbuffeted early in the year by the government shutdown and financial market volatility, it bounced\nback in the spring and remains near its post-recession high. I am also encouraged to see a\nrelatively high personal saving rate (6.5 percent in March 2019), which suggests consumers have\nthe wherewithal to maintain spending in the event of a temporary adverse shock.\nAnother reason I expect the economy to maintain its forward momentum in 2019 is that\nbusiness spending has picked up following the sharp slowdown in 2015-16. While I don’t expect\nto see the same robust growth of business fixed investment that we saw last year, I do expect to\nsee it make a positive contribution to overall growth. The waning of the fiscal stimulus, higher\n\n2\n\n\finterest rates, and lower oil prices will all contribute to a slower pace of activity. Still, business\noptimism remains high, and the outlook for sales and profits over the medium term remains\nsolid.\nAs always, there are risks to the outlook, and this generally positive outlook has several\nprominent downside risks. Over the medium term, I see the biggest risks coming from trade\npolicy uncertainty and slower growth abroad, particularly in China, the euro area, and the United\nKingdom. To the extent slower foreign growth and waning fiscal and monetary stimulus\nrepresent a stronger headwind than I am building into my baseline forecast, we could see\nsomewhat slower growth. Right now the data are noisy, and we need more time and evidence to\njudge whether this risk materializes.\nFinally, the current outlook for inflation appears to be benign and, in my view, broadly\nconsistent with our price stability mandate. While inflation has declined over the course of this\nyear, last year at this time it was near 2 percent. On a month-to-month basis, movements in\ninflation are typically dominated by transitory factors such as changes in energy and import\nprices. More fundamentally, to the extent beneficial supply side developments such as increased\nproductivity growth may be pushing inflation down, they promote higher real wages and,\nultimately, higher standards of living.\n\nOutlook for Monetary Policy\nAt its April meeting the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at\n2¼ to 2½ percent and indicated that it could be patient as it determines whether future\nadjustments to the target range may be appropriate. I supported that decision. This wait-and-see\n\n3\n\n\fapproach is appropriate because we have not seen upward pressures building on inflation, even\nthough we have experienced above trend growth and a further tightening of labor markets.\nOver the course of this year, I will be looking for evidence on the amount of slack, if any,\nthat remains in labor markets; signs that businesses are changing their pricing behavior; and\nevidence that longer-run inflation expectations could be signaling a lack of confidence in the\nFed’s ability to achieve its longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent. I’ll also be evaluating the\nstance of policy relative to the estimates of the long-run neutral policy rate – the interest rate\nconsistent with price stability and maximum employment. This rate has apparently declined over\nthe past decade, but its precise level is uncertain and subject to change.\n\nThe Balanced Approach\nFostering a strong labor market while maintaining price stability is of course the core of\nthe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress. With the unemployment rate at an historic\nlow level and inflation currently running under the FOMC’s objective, a longer-run policy issue\nis whether the persistent undershoot of the inflation objective is undermining its credibility and\ncausing inflation to be anchored at too low a level. Some have expressed concern that if inflation\nexpectations fall persistently below the 2 percent objective, that the extent we could lower real\ninterest rates by reducing our target for the federal funds rate – the Fed’s key policy tool – would\nbe diminished. This could limit the accommodation we could provide in a future downturn\nbecause interest rates cannot fall below a lower bound of roughly zero percent.\nAt the time the FOMC adopted its 2 percent inflation objective in 2012, monetary policy\nwas highly accommodative, unconventional policy tools were being deployed, and inflation was\nrunning above 2 percent. Since then, inflation has run persistently below 2 percent. I have not\n\n4\n\n\fviewed this as a major concern given that, aside from the effects of wide fluctuations in energy\nprices, inflation has remained low and relatively stable. Since 2012, core PCE inflation has\nfluctuated in a range of roughly 1½ to 2 percent, except during 2015 when a strong dollar pushed\ncore inflation somewhat below 1½ percent.\nAs long as inflation was below its objective and unemployment was above its longer-run\nlevel, it was appropriate to run an accommodative policy to promote the movement of both\nvariables back toward their longer-run sustainable levels. Accommodative policies tend to lower\nunemployment and, generally speaking, increase inflation.\nBut with the unemployment rate now below its longer-run level, should we still be\nconcerned about inflation running slightly below target? As I listen to business and community\nleaders around my region, I hear few complaints about inflation being too low. In fact, I am\nmore likely to hear disbelief when I mention that inflation is as low as measured in a number of\nkey sectors.\nThis leads me to the observation that inflation as experienced by households and\nbusinesses is fundamentally different from inflation as viewed by financial market participants\nand many economists. Households see the prices of everyday goods such as food, energy, rents,\nand health care rising and don’t understand why the Fed would be concerned that inflation is too\nlow. Their short-run expectations for inflation are driven largely by changes in retail gasoline\nprices while their longer-run expectations, as measured by the University of Michigan, have been\nfairly stable. (Expected changes in prices during the next 5 years have fluctuated between 2.3\nand 2.6 percent since January 2018 and are currently at 2.3 percent.)\nBusinesses see their labor and other input costs rising, and with limited pricing power,\nsee their profit margins squeezed. For them, the product prices they charge are determined by\n\n5\n\n\fstructural factors such as global competition and technological disruption that don’t necessarily\nrespond to monetary policy, while their costs are driven by tight labor and commodity market\nconditions. In the April survey of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of\nIndependent Business, only 1 percent of respondents said inflation was their single most\nimportant problem, compared with 24 percent who said “quality of labor” and 8 percent who said\n“cost of labor.”\nIn contrast, financial market participants see inflation and inflation expectations as key\ndrivers of monetary policy decisions. They look at past, current, and expected future inflation\nrelative to target to form a view about the policy path that they then use to price financial market\ninstruments. If they perceive the 2 percent inflation objective as a line in the sand that the Fed\ndoes not want to overshoot, they may come to expect inflation to run below 2 percent over the\nlonger run. This concern has led to calls for the Fed to ease rates to push inflation and inflation\nexpectations higher in an effort to maintain the credibility of the target and preserve policy space.\nBut even if such a policy were effective, how is policy space preserved if rates have to be cut to\nboost longer-run inflation expectations?\nEven with these concerns, I supported the FOMC’s decision to adopt a 2 percent longerrun objective for inflation in 2012, and I support it today. I believe it has been effective in\nhelping anchor longer-run inflation expectations. Arguably, though, adopting a point estimate\ninstead of a range has placed considerable attention on a precise target and has exaggerated the\nprecision with which monetary policy can achieve this goal.1 It would seem reasonable that even\nJon Faust and Eric Leeper describe the “disparate confounding dynamics” of inflation that makes it difficult to\nexplain movements in inflation with a small number of “conventional summary statistics for headline aggregates”\nand “complicates the nature of appropriate monetary policy,” in “The Myth of Normal: The Bumpy Story of\nInflation and Monetary Policy,” Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,\nJackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, August 2015,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2015/2015faust_leeper.pdf?la=en.\n1\n\n6\n\n\fsomewhat persistent deviations from the objective, if they are limited to, say 50 basis points\nabove or below, may be acceptable taken in the context of broader economic conditions.\nThe FOMC anticipated that its objectives for employment and inflation could move in\ndifferent directions. It addresses this issue in its annual “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy,” noting that when its objectives are not complementary, the\nCommittee follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of\nthe deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation\nare projected to return to mandate-consistent levels.\nWhat this means is that we should not focus on one leg of the mandate without\nconsideration for the other. For example, cutting interest rates today to boost inflation to 2\npercent at some point in the future would likely cause labor markets to tighten further, leading to\na reallocation of resources into the most interest sensitive sectors. Given the current\nunresponsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness, it might take a considerable further\neasing of policy and considerable further tightening of labor market conditions to have the\ndesired impact on inflation. And given the lags with which monetary policy operates, it may\ntake a considerable period of time. In the meantime, lower interest rates might fuel asset price\nbubbles, create financial imbalances, and ultimately a recession.\nIn current circumstances, with an unemployment rate well below its projected longer-run\nlevel, I see little reason to be concerned about inflation running a bit below its longer-run\nobjective. Moreover, I am not convinced that a slight undershoot of inflation below objective\nrequires an offsetting overshoot of the objective. As I mentioned earlier, the current benign\ninflation outlook gives us the opportunity to test our assumptions about the degree of slack in the\neconomy and the level of the neutral rate of interest.\n\n7\n\n\fConclusions\nWith the current outlook for the economy remaining positive, monetary policy settings\nlook appropriate to me. As we look ahead, however, there is a legitimate concern that monetary\npolicy “space” could be limited in response to a future downturn because of the low level of\ninterest rates.2 This has led some to argue for a higher inflation target or the adoption of some\nkind of a price-level target. While I see little value in pursuing a higher inflation target given the\ncredibility we have built over the last decade around 2 percent, the Federal Reserve will be\nseeking ideas and input on alternative policy strategies next month at a conference hosted by the\nChicago Fed.3 It will be an opportunity to learn more about the pros and cons of different\napproaches for our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications practices.\nThe current level of inflation may perplex central bankers and financial market\nparticipants, but in the context of a growing economy and job gains, it doesn’t demand a Fed\npolicy response in my view. Steering what is currently a low and stable rate of inflation up by\n20-50 basis points to reach a precise numerical target, while disregarding the labor market, the\nother leg of our dual mandate, strikes me as a degree of fine-tuning that goes beyond our span of\ncontrol.\n\n2\n\nOther government policies that focus on productivity growth and labor force participation might contribute to faster\ntrend growth and a higher natural rate of interest, thereby providing additional monetary policy space. Moreover,\nthe prospect of a future return to the zero lower bound suggests that, along with monetary policy, fiscal policies need\nto be on the menu of possible counter-cyclical options.\n3\nFormer Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen discussed possible monetary policy responses to a future recession,\nincluding the use of an aggressive policy rule for setting the funds rate in advance of hitting the zero lower bound\n(ZLB), and asset purchases and forward guidance at the ZLB in “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit:\nPast, Present and Future,” Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future, Federal Reserve Bank\nof Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, August 2016.\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016yellen.pdf?la=en.\n\n8\n\n\f"

With 17 participants currently sitting on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC), the public has access to a variety of perspectives and insights\non the U.S. economy and monetary policy. Some have argued that communication from this\nlarge number of policymakers can confuse the public about our policy path. That potential exists.\nOn net, though, I think the Federal Reserve System’s transparency is a strength, giving financial\nmarkets and the broader public a sense of the diversity of views that come to bear on policy\nstrategy, tactics and stance.\nIn my remarks this evening, I’ll offer my views on the economic outlook and monetary\npolicy, focusing in particular on how I think about our price stability mandate and related\ncommunications.1 As central banks have done in other countries, the Federal Reserve announced\nlast November its plans to review its monetary policy strategy, tools and communications\npractices.2 This review strikes me as appropriate under any circumstance given the ongoing\nevolution of the economy. But it may be especially important now in a low interest rate\nenvironment given the real possibility of a future return to the zero lower bound. In the spirit of\nthis review, I’ll offer a few preliminary thoughts on the FOMC’s inflation objective and policy\nstrategies.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank George Kahn for his assistance in preparing these remarks.\nReview of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-andcommunications.htm. See also, Richard Clarida, “The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy Strategy,\nand Communication Practices, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20190222a.htm.\n2\n\n1\n\n\fEconomic Outlook\nI’ll begin with a brief review of the economic outlook. Last year, the U.S. economy\nenjoyed robust growth boosted by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. As the stimulus\nfrom these policies wanes, and global growth slows, I expect a deceleration this year toward the\neconomy’s longer-run growth trend of roughly 2 percent.\nMy outlook for continued, but somewhat more moderate growth, is tied to expectations\nthat job gains, wage increases and consumer confidence will remain supportive of consumer\nspending. Although the monthly increase in payroll employment fell to just 20,000 last month,\nthe previous two months were revised up and, averaging over the last three months, employment\nincreased by a strong 186,000 jobs per month. Weaker aspects of the February jobs report\nsuggest the unusually harsh winter weather negatively impacted construction employment and\nspending on entertainment. While I would expect to see a rebound in March, employment growth\nwill likely slow to a rate more consistent with the net rate of entry into the labor force.\nAs the job market has tightened, labor compensation has steadily accelerated. Average\nhourly earnings have climbed from an annual rate of roughly 2½ percent last February to almost\n3½ percent this February. And with low rates of inflation, workers are beginning to see\nsignificant real income gains. Real personal disposable income increased almost 4 percent last\nyear on a twelve-month basis. Although consumer confidence has been buffeted by the\ngovernment shutdown, financial market volatility, and a softening of employment growth in\nFebruary, consumers continue to expect the economy to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace\nthan last year. Moreover, given the relatively high personal saving rate (7.6 percent in December\n2018), consumers have the wherewithal to maintain spending in the event of a temporary adverse\nshock.\n\n2\n\n\fAnother reason I expect the economy to maintain its forward momentum in 2019 is that\nbusinesses have increased capital spending after the sharp slowdown in 2015-16. While I don’t\nexpect to see the same robust growth of business fixed investment that we saw last year, I do\nexpect to see it make a positive contribution to overall growth. The waning of the fiscal stimulus,\nhigher interest rates, and lower oil prices will all contribute to a slower pace of activity. Still,\nbusiness optimism remains high, and the outlook for sales and profits over the medium term\nremains solid.\nAs always, there are risks to the outlook, and this generally positive outlook has several\nprominent downside risks. Tracking measures of first quarter growth appear to be weak, but\ncould well reflect the influence of transitory factors such as the government shutdown, financial\nvolatility, an unusually harsh winter, and heightened policy uncertainty. Over the medium term, I\nsee the biggest risk coming from slower growth abroad, particularly in China, the euro area, and\nthe United Kingdom. To the extent slower foreign growth and waning fiscal and monetary\nstimulus represent a stronger headwind than I am building into my baseline forecast, we could\nsee somewhat slower growth. Right now the data are noisy, and we need more time and evidence\nto separate the signal from the noise.\nFinally, the current outlook for inflation appears to be benign, and I consider the recent\nbehavior of inflation to be broadly consistent with our price stability mandate.\n\nOutlook for monetary policy\nWith the solid expansion experienced over the past few years and a generally positive\noutlook over the medium term, the Federal Reserve has been in a position to remove much of the\npolicy accommodation that was put in place during the financial crisis and Great Recession. In\n\n3\n\n\faddition to raising short-term rates 225 basis points, the Fed’s balance sheet has been slowly\nshrinking as securities have matured. At its meeting last week, the FOMC noted it would\nconclude the reduction of its securities holdings by the end of September.3 With high levels of\nemployment and low inflation readings, the FOMC has judged it can be patient in determining\nwhether it needs to take any further policy actions. I supported that decision.\n\nEvaluating our inflation objective\nFostering a strong labor market while maintaining price stability is of course the core of\nthe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress. With the unemployment rate at a historically\nlow level and inflation currently running just under the FOMC’s objective, a longer-run policy\nissue is whether the persistent undershoot of our inflation objective is undermining its credibility\nand causing inflation to be anchored at too low a level. If inflation expectations fall persistently\nbelow 2 percent, the extent we could lower real interest rates by reducing our nominal target for\nthe funds rate would be diminished. This could limit the accommodation we could provide if we\nwere to return to the zero lower bound.\nAt the time the FOMC adopted its 2 percent inflation objective in 2012, monetary policy\nwas highly accommodative, unconventional policy tools were being deployed, and inflation was\nrunning above 2 percent. Since then, inflation has run persistently below 2 percent. I have not\nviewed this as a major concern given that, aside from the effects of wide fluctuations in energy\nprices, inflation has remained low and relatively stable. Since 2012, core PCE inflation has\nfluctuated in a range of roughly 1½ to 2 percent, except during 2015 when a strong dollar pushed\ncore inflation somewhat below 1½ percent\n\nFor information about the Committee’s plans for the size of its securities holdings and the transition to the longerrun operating regime, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization.htm.\n3\n\n4\n\n\fShould we be concerned about this low level of inflation? As I listen to business and\ncommunity leaders around my region, I hear few complaints about inflation being too low. In\nfact, I am more likely to hear disbelief when I mention that inflation is as low as measured in a\nnumber of key sectors. I see this reaction to inflation as a good sign, and consider this\nperformance consistent with the definition of price stability that Paul Volcker and Alan\nGreenspan preferred. Both of them judged price stability as an inflation rate that is sufficiently\nlow [and stable] that it is not considered a key factor in the decisions of businesses or\nhouseholds.\nEven so, I supported the FOMC’s decision to adopt a 2 percent longer-run objective for\ninflation in 2012, and I support it today. I believe it has been effective in helping anchor longerrun inflation expectations. Arguably, though, adopting a point estimate instead of a range has\nplaced considerable attention on a precise target and has exaggerated the precision with which\nmonetary policy can achieve this particular numerical target.4 It would seem reasonable that even\nsomewhat persistent deviations from the objective, if they are limited to, say 50 basis points\nabove or below the objective may be acceptable, depending on broader economic conditions.\nI also support the idea that the objective should be symmetric so that deviations below\nand above the objective should be viewed as costly, taking into account deviations of\nemployment from our employment objective. Consistent with the FOMC’s “Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” this suggests that when our objectives are not\ncomplementary, we follow a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the\nJon Faust and Eric Leeper describe the “disparate confounding dynamics” of inflation that makes it difficult to\nexplain movements in inflation with a small number of “conventional summary statistics for headline aggregates”\nand “complicates the nature of appropriate monetary policy,” in “The Myth of Normal: The Bumpy Story of\nInflation and Monetary Policy,” Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,\nJackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, August 2015,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2015/2015faust_leeper.pdf?la=en.\n4\n\n5\n\n\fmagnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment\nand inflation are projected to return to mandate-consistent levels. In current circumstances, with\nan unemployment rate well below its projected longer-run level, I see little reason to be\nconcerned about inflation running a bit below its longer-run objective. Moreover, I am not\nconvinced that a slight undershoot of inflation below objective requires an offsetting overshoot\nof the objective. As I mentioned earlier, the current benign inflation outlook gives us the\nopportunity to test our assumptions about the degree of slack in the economy and the level of the\nnatural rate of interest.\nAs we look ahead, however, there is a legitimate concern that monetary policy “space”\ncould be limited in the next downturn because of the low level of interest rates.5 This has led\nsome to argue for a higher inflation target or the adoption of some kind of a price-level target.\nWhile I see little value in pursuing a higher inflation target given the credibility we have built\nover the last decade around 2 percent, evaluating alternative policy strategies is appropriate.6\nSome have promoted the use of a temporary price-level target that takes effect when the federal\nfunds rate target hits the zero bound. Another approach might be an inflation target that is\nachieved on average over a fixed period of time or over the business cycle. In theory, a price-\n\n5\n\nOther government policies that focus on productivity growth and labor force participation might contribute to faster\ntrend growth and a higher natural rate of interest, thereby providing additional monetary policy space. Moreover, the\nprospect of a future return to the zero lower bound suggests that, along with monetary policy, fiscal policies need to\nbe on the menu of possible counter-cyclical options.\n6\nFormer Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen discussed possible monetary policy responses to a future recession,\nincluding the use of an aggressive policy rule for setting the funds rate in advance of hitting the zero lower bound\n(ZLB), and asset purchases and forward guidance at the ZLB in “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit:\nPast, Present and Future,” Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future, Federal Reserve Bank\nof Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, August 2016.\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016yellen.pdf?la=en. At the same symposium,\nMarvin Goodfriend discussed the use of negative nominal interest rates in “The Case for Unencumbering Interest\nRate Policy at the Zero Bound.”\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016goodfriend.pdf?la=en.\n\n6\n\n\flevel target that is fully credible could potentially smooth fluctuations in output and employment,\nespecially at the zero lower bound.\nWhile not pre-judging the potential efficacy of such strategies, I see both fundamental\nand practical issues to grapple with in moving to such regimes. What works in elegant economic\nmodels can have limitations and unintended consequences when put into practice.\nFundamentally, an effective price-level target could substantially reduce uncertainty about the\nprice level many years into the future and thereby help households and businesses make longterm plans and commitments. It also could increase the variability of, and uncertainty about,\ninflation over the medium term. This is because a price-level target would require policymakers\nto engineer an increase in inflation in response to the price level falling below its target path and\nengineer a decrease in inflation in response to the price level rising above the target path. These\nbenefits and costs would need to be carefully weighed.\nOn a more practical level, there are a number of issues to be considered. First, in a pricelevel targeting regime, choosing the base period can make a big difference. For example, getting\nback to a 2 percent price-level path that was based in a year just prior to the Great Recession\nwould require a much longer period of above 2-percent inflation than if the base year were set\nmore recently. This is simply because the cumulative undershoot of the 2-percent price path\nwould be so much greater under the earlier base period.\nSecond, given the difficulty over the last decade in getting inflation up to 2 percent on a\nsustained basis, it is not clear to me that adopting a price-level target would be any more\neffective than our current inflation target. And deliberately pushing inflation above 2 percent at a\ntime when the unemployment rate is well below its presumed longer-run level could be costly. It\n\n7\n\n\fwould likely require a further overheating of the labor market with related misallocation of\nresources, along with increased uncertainty about the future inflation rate and price level.\nThird, a price-level targeting strategy is time inconsistent unless policymakers can\ncredibly commit to following it. If the goal is to have inflation of 2 percent on average, a period\nof below 2 percent inflation would require an equal period of inflation above 2 percent. But once\ninflation has moved up to 2 percent, policymakers might be tempted to renege on their prior\ncommitment and not allow inflation to go higher. This would undermine the future credibility of\nthe price-level targeting strategy. To the extent the public understood this time inconsistency\nproblem, price-level targeting would not be credible to begin with, absent a commitment device.\nWith regular turnover among members of the FOMC, it would be difficult for one Committee to\ncommit a future Committee to a particular course of action.\nFourth, the timeframe for achieving an average inflation target would be difficult to\ndetermine and communicate. “Over the business cycle” is a vague timeframe since business\ncycles vary in length and recessions are notoriously difficult to predict. Given that U.S. inflation\nhas been below target for seven years, would we need or want seven-plus years of inflation\nabove 2 percent? At what point should bygones be bygones?\nFinally, the Federal Reserve’s most recent Monetary Policy Report to Congress contained\na section on policy rules and systematic monetary policy. It provided an example of a price-level\ntargeting rule that included the gap between the level of prices today and the level of prices that\nwould be observed if inflation had been a constant at 2 percent from a specified starting year\n(1998). The prescription from that rule would have been to set the target funds rate at less than 1\npercent at the end of last year. Of course, it is impossible to judge the counterfactual implications\nof maintaining the funds rate target at or below 1 percent throughout the recovery. I think it is\n\n8\n\n\ffair to assume, however, that the potential to generate real and financial imbalances might be\nsubstantial, ultimately imposing an even higher cost to the economy than where we are today.\n\nConclusions\nThe economy’s fundamentals are sound. Downside risks are notable however as my\noutlook calls for growth to slow to trend, with moderating job gains and low inflation. In these\ncircumstances, monetary policy can take a wait-and-see approach.\nOver the longer-run, with an evolving economy, prudent policymaking would suggest\ntaking a look at our current policy strategies to see if they can be improved or refined, especially\nin light of the possibility of a future return to the zero lower bound. In doing so, we must be\naware that what works in theory may have limitations and unintended consequences when\nadopted in practice. The Federal Reserve will explore these issues as part of its review of its\nmonetary policy strategy, tools and communications practices this year.\n\n9\n\n\f"

            "content": "“Are We There Yet?”\nThe U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy\n\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJanuary 15, 2019\nCentral Exchange\nKansas City, Mo.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fI’m delighted to be back with the Central Exchange for what has become something of a\nNew Year’s tradition. This year marks another rotation for me into the role of a voting member\non the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC)—the body that sets our nation’s\nmonetary policy.\nAs you may know, the FOMC consists of the governors of the Federal Reserve Board,\nwho are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and the presidents of the 12\nregional Federal Reserve Banks, who are appointed by their respective Boards of Directors\nsubject to the approval of the Board of Governors in Washington. Each of the governors and the\nregional Fed presidents participate in all FOMC meetings. However, voting rights are rotated\namong the presidents each year. In contrast to the governors and the New York Fed president,\nwho each have a permanent vote on the FOMC, the other 11 Fed presidents share four votes on a\nrotating basis. This system was designed to ensure that the publicly appointed governors have a\nmajority of votes on the Committee unless there are vacancies on the Board of Governors. As\npresident of the Kansas City Fed, I rotate voting with the presidents of the Minneapolis and San\nFrancisco Feds.\nWith that in mind, my remarks today will focus on the current state of the economy and,\nin that context, how I’m thinking about the stance of monetary policy.\nThe U.S. economy is currently enjoying one of its longest expansions, while the Federal\nReserve has been gradually removing a portion of the massive accommodation it provided\nbeginning in 2008. Short-term interest rates have moved up and the Fed’s sizeable balance\nsheet, which reached $4.5 trillion in late 2014, has been slowly shrinking. With these conditions\nin play, the questions currently being asked are, “Where are we in the normalization process?\nDo we have some distance to go to reach a ‘normal’ interest rate or are we nearly there?”\n\n1\n\n\fThese questions remind me of road trips with my children. Filled with anticipation to\nreach the destination, they would ask, repeatedly, “Are we there yet, how much longer?” The\nanswer was usually a vague response, like “We’re getting close. Just look out the window.”\nToday, even with GPS-like technology to serve as a guide, I find our policy map is\nincomplete and, therefore, I cannot give an exact answer to how close we are to a neutral setting\nfor interest rates. There remains a host of factors that can influence its “location,” and, as a\nconsequence, will affect the journey ahead. The truth is that a vague “we’re getting close” may\nbe the best response I have to offer.\nLet me share my thoughts on where we are and why this is the case, reminding you that\nthe views I express today are my own.\n\nA Look at the U.S. Economy and Where We Are\nBy most measures, the U.S. economy is performing well. The unemployment rate is near\na 50-year low, and inflation is stable and well-anchored near the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent\ntarget. In addition, real gross domestic product (GDP)—our broadest measure of economic\nactivity—is increasing at a moderate pace, supported by both consumer spending and business\nfixed investment. Last year, with accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, real GDP grew at\nan estimated annual rate of roughly 3 percent—somewhat above the economy’s longer-run\ngrowth potential, which is estimated to be a bit below 2 percent.\nLooking ahead, I would expect to see a somewhat slower rate of growth, closer to but\nperhaps still a bit above, the economy’s longer-run growth potential. While we have begun to\nsee some slowing in interest-sensitive sectors such as housing and motor vehicles, considerable\nunderlying momentum remains and should serve to sustain the expansion. For example,\n\n2\n\n\fbusiness and consumer confidence are both near post-recession highs. Wages are rising at a\nroughly 3 percent annual rate, up from 2½ percent a year ago. Manufacturing activity has\nrecovered from a slowdown in 2015-16 and is now expanding at a solid pace. And, employment\ncontinues to grow at a rate that is faster than required to absorb new entrants into the job market.\nAlongside these favorable outcomes, there are of course factors that will affect this\nperformance and pose risks to the outlook. On the upside, growth above the economy’s longerrun potential could further stretch labor markets, leading to wage gains that are out of line with\nproductivity growth. As these wage gains begin to shrink profit margins, firms may pass higher\nlabor costs on to their customers causing inflation to rise. According to standard economic\ntheory, there is a level of unemployment—called the natural rate of unemployment—at which\ninflation neither rises nor falls. When the unemployment rate falls below the natural rate,\ninflation tends to rise. There is a lot of uncertainty about where the natural rate is, but current\nestimates place it around 4½ percent. Thus, with the unemployment rate at 3.9 percent in\nDecember and expected to fall further, it is possible that we could be on the cusp of an\nundesirable increase in inflation.\nOn the downside, financial market conditions have tightened and become more volatile.\nThe foreign exchange value of the dollar has appreciated, contributing to a loss of\ncompetitiveness of our exports and potentially a softening of inflation below our 2 percent\nobjective. Credit spreads have widened, making capital investment costlier. Uncertainty about\ntrade policy and global economic growth has increased, possibly causing businesses to postpone\nor rethink capital spending projects. In my travels around the seven states of the Tenth Federal\nReserve District, I increasingly hear that input costs are rising, qualified workers are hard to find\n\n3\n\n\fand retain, pricing power is limited, and that firms are pulling back rather than passing higher\ncosts on to their customers.\nTwo sectors of particular importance to our region have their own unique set of\nchallenges. The farm sector is in a prolonged downturn as a result of declining agricultural\nprices, made worse by retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm products. And the oil and gas sector is\nfacing another sharp decline in oil prices. While this sector has expanded dramatically since the\nearly 2000s thanks to fracking and the related shale oil revolution, sharp oil price fluctuations\nhave led to a boom-and-bust cycle that may be repeating itself.\nTo summarize, labor markets are tight, inflation is low and stable, and economic growth\nis expected to slow to a rate close to the economy’s longer-run growth potential.\nNotwithstanding both upside and downside risks, the outlook for the economy appears favorable.\n\nImplications for monetary policy\nWith this background, let me turn to the matter of monetary policy. Since the beginning\nof the interest rate normalization process in December 2015, the Federal Reserve has raised rates\n225 basis points, removing much of the policy accommodation that was put in place during the\nfinancial crisis and Great Recession.\nSo, are we there yet? Has the FOMC raised rates back to a neutral or normal level so that\nthey are no longer either stimulating or restraining economic activity? Have we reached the\nproverbial soft landing where the economy has achieved maximum employment, stable prices,\ngrowth at potential, and monetary policy neutrality? In my view, we are not there just yet.\nHowever, we are close and for now, it seems to me that we should proceed with caution and be\npatient as we approach our destination.\n\n4\n\n\fAs the year unfolds, I will be looking for signals from the economy in a number of areas\nthat will determine my policy choices. My position on whether to further increase rates or stay\nwhere we currently are will depend on several factors. If, for example, the inflation outlook\nremains benign despite tight labor markets or if the downside risks I spoke of earlier materialize,\nwe can pause the normalization process. On the other hand, if inflation pressures emerge, it\nwould suggest we are further away from neutral than we may have previously thought and\nfurther interest rate increases could be necessary.\nIn judging future economic conditions, I am mindful that the effects of past policy actions\nhave not yet fully played out, calling for patience in considering our policy actions. As the\nfamous economist Milton Friedman observed, monetary policy acts with “long and variable\nlags.” Typically, policy moves affect real economic activity with a lag of six months to a year\nand inflation in one to two years. Given the cumulative 225 basis points of tightening—100\nbasis points of which occurred last year—we have likely not yet seen the full effect of higher\nrates on real economic activity or inflation. A pause in the normalization process would give us\ntime to assess if the economy is responding as expected with a slowing of growth to a pace that\nis sustainable over the longer run. Failure to recognize these lags could lead to an overtightening of policy, a downturn in economic growth and an undershooting of our inflation\nobjective.\nThese issues are made all the more difficult by a fact that I mentioned earlier in my\nremarks—the map guiding us is incomplete. We do not know precisely the location of our\ndestination: that is, the longer-run neutral value of the federal funds rate. Recall that the neutral\nrate is the rate that neither stimulates economic activity nor restrains it. Participants at last\nmonth’s FOMC meeting gave a range of estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate from 2½\n\n5\n\n\fpercent to 3½ percent with a median of 2.8 percent. With the funds rate target currently at 2¼ to\n2½ percent, we are near the lower end of the range of our estimates of neutral. And complicating\nour reliance on these estimates is that, in the background, we are gradually reducing the size of\nour balance sheet, allowing assets to roll off as they mature. It is unclear whether, or how much,\nthis roll off is further removing accommodation. Again, this suggests it might be a good time to\npause our interest rate normalization, study the incoming evidence and data, and verify our\ncurrent location.\nA final reason to show patience around further rate adjustments is that a number of key\neconomic relationships that have guided policy over the years may have broken down in the\naftermath of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Structural changes in the economy such as\nthe aging of the population, sluggish productivity growth, business sector consolidation, rising\ngovernment deficits and debt, and historically low interest rates have potentially rendered past\nguideposts to policy less reliable. In addition, central banks in other parts of the world, like the\nFederal Reserve, undertook massive asset purchase programs to address the financial crisis, and\nare now beginning to confront the need to shrink their balance sheets. These central bank\ninterventions may be changing the structure of financial markets in unknown and unpredictable\nways.\nOne relationship, for example, that has confounded economists and policymakers over\nthe past several years is that of inflation and economic slack. As mentioned earlier, when the\nunemployment rate falls below its natural rate, we generally expect inflation to rise. But despite\nunemployment falling well below most estimates of the natural rate, inflation has remained\nsubdued. This raises questions about whether our estimate of the natural rate is too pessimistic\nand whether the economy can operate at a lower unemployment rate today than in the past\n\n6\n\n\fwithout sparking inflationary pressures. This is another area where I will be looking for\nfeedback from the economy to assess whether we might need to revise our estimates of the\nnatural rate.\nTo this mix, I would add any number of additional real and financial market indicators to\nmonitor closely for evidence that monetary policy is approaching neutral and that the pace of\nnormalization should change. Gauging the appropriate policy response will also importantly be\nshaped by analysis from my staff and input from a wide range of contacts who have on-theground knowledge of financial conditions, price pressures, and the outlook for economic activity.\n\nConclusion\nEarlier in the normalization process, the FOMC provided forward guidance suggesting\nthat monetary policy was accommodative and that gradual interest rate increases would be\nconsistent with achieving our goals. Given current economic conditions, providing such explicit\nguidance now about the future path of policy rates would not be appropriate in my view.\nBack then, policy was some distance from a neutral setting and we had not fully realized\nour objectives for employment and inflation, and thus the direction of policy was clear. Today,\ncircumstances are different. While my policy view always depends on the flow of data, this year\nwe must acknowledge that rates are approaching, and may be closing in on, our destination of\nneutral. We should also remain sharply aware that the effects of past rate increases, while\ndissipating, are still in play and the effects will need to be watched carefully.\nIt is possible that some additional rate increases will be appropriate. But making that\njudgment is not urgent and should depend on a careful look at the data and gathering additional\n\n7\n\n\finsight into where our destination is, how much further we need to go to reach it and how\nquickly we should get there.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "Thoughts on the U.S. Economy, Monetary Policy and\nEnergy Sector Dynamics\n\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 11, 2018\nEconomic Forum\nTulsa, Oklahoma\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fTen years ago this month, financial conditions were fragile and the economy was deep in\nrecession. The unemployment rate stood at 6.5 percent on its way to 10 percent a year later.\nThe recovery from that recession was slow, but the economy has come a long way. The\ncombination of fiscal stimulus, corporate and bank bailouts, and unconventional monetary policy\naided in stabilizing the economy. Yet, these dramatic actions did not generate the sharp bounce\nback of economic activity that we might have expected based on some past recoveries. Instead,\nthe economy found its footing in a moderate, but resilient, recovery with annual growth in real\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) of around 2 percent. More surprisingly, despite the sluggish\npace of output growth, employment has grown at a relatively brisk pace, pushing the\nunemployment rate down to its lowest level since 1969.\nBecause we are well into a recovery of record length, and with interest rates increasing,\nmany pundits are saying a recession is inevitably on the horizon. Others are convinced that\nrecent tax cuts and increased government spending, combined with robust consumer and\nbusiness spending, provide momentum that could extend the current expansion. Rather than try\nto project the future, I’ll discuss what I see as the key factors that are in play today and that, on\nbalance, suggest continued growth ahead. In doing so, I’ll offer my views on monetary policy\nand highlight the changing role of the energy sector in contributing to the overall performance of\nthe economy, including the region served by the Kansas City Fed.\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook\nBy nearly every measure, the U.S. economy is performing well. With accommodative\nfinancial conditions, elevated levels of confidence and solid labor markets, it seems reasonable to\nexpect economic growth slightly above trend with low and stable inflation for the next few years.\n\n1\n\n\fConsumers are poised to continue to be the main force behind this expansion, and the recent\npickup in business investment may continue as well.\nDigging a little deeper into the details, several factors support the outlook for\nconsumption. Household balance sheets remain strong. The latest data show that the personal\nsavings rate is 6.6 percent and household net worth as a share of income is at a historically high\nlevel. Wage growth has steadily increased, approaching 3 percent in the latest reports, and\nconsumer confidence is at its highest level since prior to 2008. Finally, job gains continue to rise\nfaster than is needed to absorb workers entering the labor force.\nThe outlook for business spending is also favorable. Business investment expanded\nrobustly last year, and the momentum has continued in 2018. During the first half of this year,\nbusiness investment grew at an average annualized rate of 10 percent. This is a welcome step up\nfrom the stagnant investment levels in 2015-2016.\nLooking ahead, capital expenditures seem poised to continue at a robust pace, as\neconomic growth remains solid, borrowing costs remain low, and rising labor costs combined\nwith labor shortages lead firms to invest in technology to automate tasks. The recent cut in the\ncorporate tax rate provides additional incentives for investment. And, as I will discuss later,\nadvances in shale oil production have become an important factor in boosting investment. This\nimpetus from the energy sector seems likely to continue. Over the longer-term, however,\ninvestment spending will likely slow to a more sustainable rate in line with the economy’s\npotential growth rate.\nOther sectors of the economy, including net exports, residential investment, and\ninventories, are likely to be a more neutral and uncertain influence on the overall economy. For\nexample, the recent appreciation of the dollar, along with possible retaliatory tariffs and slower\n\n2\n\n\fgrowth in the emerging market economies, could cause net exports be a modest drag on overall\neconomic growth. Nevertheless, I expect domestic demand to remain strong.\nThis strong demand growth will reinforce the outlook for a tight labor market. The\nunemployment rate currently stands at 3.7 percent, well below most estimates of its long-run\nsustainable level. With solid employment gains averaging 190,000 jobs per month in the last\nthree months, some observers argue the economy is getting a second wind. My own\ninterpretation of these gains is that we are seeing the hallmarks of a mature expansion. Looking\nthrough monthly fluctuations in the job market reports shows that the pace of payroll growth has\nactually moderated from a few years ago. At its peak in early 2015, the year-over-year change in\ntotal payrolls was roughly 3 million. In contrast, the latest data point to a year-over-year change\nin total payrolls of 2.5 million. I expect this trend of slowing employment gains to continue as\nlabor market conditions tighten further and it becomes harder for firms to fill vacancies.\nDespite tight labor markets and above trend growth, inflation has remained low. In fact,\ninflation has been remarkably stable even as the unemployment rate has fallen sharply. That\nsaid, the accommodative stance of monetary policy that has prevailed, even as the\nunemployment rate has fallen below estimates of its long-run sustainable level, could push\ninflation somewhat higher over the next couple of years. Of course, the outlook for inflation has\nimplications for monetary policy.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nAt last month’s meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took another step\nto remove some of the extraordinary monetary accommodation that has been in place since the\nonset of the financial crisis. This gradual normalization of policy seems appropriate to me given\n\n3\n\n\fthat the FOMC’s employment and inflation objectives have largely been achieved while the\ncurrent setting of its overnight interest rate target remains below estimates of its longer-run\nvalue.\nAs the FOMC seeks to make monetary policy a more neutral influence on the economy\nand, thereby, sustain the economic expansion, policymakers must consider a variety of risks and\nuncertainties around the outlook for the economy. On the upside, accommodative financial\nconditions, elevated consumer confidence and expansionary fiscal policy could lead to further\nincreases in economic growth and inflation. On the downside, trade policy uncertainty, growing\nrisks in emerging market economies and policy divergence between the U.S. and other advanced\neconomies could slow down both foreign and U.S. growth.\nWhile I see these risks as currently balanced, the path of policy cannot be on a pre-set\ncourse at this stage of the expansion. The FOMC’s approach of gradual increases in the target\nfederal funds rate, combined with gradual reductions in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet, has aimed to thread this needle. This means policymakers will need to carefully assess the\neffects past policy actions are likely to have as they look for economic fundamentals to remain\nconsistent with the objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThe Shale Oil Revolution\nTo this point, I’ve talked about the cyclical nature of the economy and how monetary\npolicy interacts with those cyclical features. At the same time, however, a number of structural\nchanges are occurring in the U.S. economy that bear watching. Among these developments are\nthe aging of the population, ongoing technological change and weak readings for productivity\n\n4\n\n\fgrowth. A key industrial change that is particularly relevant in Oklahoma is related to the shale\noil revolution, and I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about some of its implications.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, sharp oil price increases pushed the U.S. economy into\n“stagflation”— an economic downturn with a simultaneous and persistent increase in inflation.\nAt the time, the United States was heavily dependent on oil imports for its energy needs, and\nhigher oil prices acted as a tax on U.S. consumers paid to foreign oil producers. Of particular\nnote, the rise in inflation that resulted from higher oil prices tended to persist. Once inflation\nrose, people expected it to remain elevated, suggesting a lack of confidence in the FOMC to\nmaintain price stability over the longer run.\nToday, the economy’s reaction to a sharp change in oil prices is quite different. As you\nknow, oil and gas production has boomed in the United States over the past two decades thanks\nto horizontal drilling and fracking technologies. In addition, the public’s expectations for\ninflation have become better anchored following the Fed’s heightened response to inflationary\nshocks as well as its adoption in 2012 of an inflation target. As a result, today, oil price increases\nlead to an increase in oil and gas production and a related increase in investment spending,\ntemporarily raising inflation but offsetting some or all of the adverse effect on aggregate\neconomic activity. Similarly, today, a sharp downturn in oil and gas prices can put temporary\ndownward pressure on inflation with benefits to consumers but adverse consequences for the\nenergy sector – as we witnessed in 2014-15. Importantly, the inflationary effects are viewed as\ntemporary rather than persistent because of the anchoring of inflation expectations around 2\npercent.\nAlthough recent developments have muted the effects of oil price changes on the\neconomy as a whole, they have to some extent increased volatility in the oil sector itself and in\n\n5\n\n\fbusiness capital expenditures. For example, the oil and gas sector nationwide has experienced a\nsurge in output per rig and per worker. From 2012 to 2017, productivity in the U.S. oil and gas\nextraction sector more than doubled.1 Associated with this increase in productivity and along\nwith wide swings in oil prices, the number of rigs and workers required for production has fallen\ndramatically.\nResearch by my staff finds that the energy sector has had a significant influence on\ninvestment spending in the U.S. economy, both to the upside and to the downside. From 2006 to\n2014, for example, total capex spending for U.S. publicly traded firms rose roughly 41 percent.\nThis boost in spending was largely driven by energy investment, which grew 125 percent\ncompared to a more modest 21 percent for non-energy investment. By the same token, after the\noil price decline in 2014, energy investment plunged more than 50 percent over the following\ntwo years. Despite a modest 2 percent growth in non-energy investment spending over this\nperiod, total capex fell 15 percent. Variability in energy investment has had a sizable influence\non the broader investment landscape.2\nOf course the shale oil boom also has had myriad effects on local economies that are\nheavily dependent on the oil and gas extraction industry. Yesterday, I had the chance to tour the\nlarge oil storage facility in Cushing, just an hour west of here, to learn more about these\ndynamics. World trade is an important issue today and it affects many local economies,\nincluding those involved in oil production. For example, with the lifting of the oil export ban,\nwe’ve seen U.S. oil exports surge, and places like Cushing are dealing with export delivery\nchallenges until investment in midstream and downstream capacity comes on line.\n\n1\n\nChad Wilkerson. 2018. “Oil and Gas Productivity Doubled in the Past Five Years—What Happens Next?”\nOklahoma Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, June 18.\n2\nDavid Rodziewicz, 2018. “Energy Investment Variability within the Macroeconomy,” Economic Review, Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, Third Quarter.\n\n6\n\n\fA key question is whether this now abundant and accessible natural resource has, on net,\nhad a positive effect on local economic conditions. Some theories suggest resource abundance\nmay increase local economic development through higher demand for labor in the energy sector\nand spillover spending in the local economy. Other theories, though, suggest industries not\nclosely related to the resource extraction industry may be harmed as energy production expands.\nFor example, labor demand by the extraction industry may be high enough to bid up local wages,\nwhich in turn could pull employees from other lower-paying jobs and make it difficult for other\nindustries to survive. At the national and international level, this phenomenon has been referred\nto as the “natural resource curse,” but the topic has received much less attention at the local\nlevel.\nStaff at the Kansas City Fed took a look at this issue and examined how the boom in the\nU.S. natural gas industry has affected local economies in the central United States. By looking at\nlabor market conditions at the county level in a nine-state region including Oklahoma, they\nanalyzed how employment and wages have responded to the rapid expansion of natural gas\nproduction from 2001 to 2011. The key finding is that the gas boom had a modest but positive\nimpact on local labor market outcomes in counties where natural gas production has increased,\nand little evidence of a so-called natural resource curse.3\nGiven the nature and scale of the dramatic developments in the energy sector, we\ncontinue to monitor this segment of our economy very closely, both in the Kansas City Fed\nregion and beyond. We stay abreast of real-time trends through roundtable discussions with\nindustry executives, and we conduct a quarterly survey of our oil and gas firms to monitor\nactivity. Our third-quarter survey will be released tomorrow morning. We also host an annual\n\n3\n\nJason P. Brown. 2014. “Production of Natural Gas from Shale in Local Economies: A Resource Blessing or\nCurse?” Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, First Quarter.\n\n7\n\n\fenergy conference with the Dallas Fed, bringing together researchers, executives, bankers, and\ngovernment officials. This year’s conference focused on trends in world oil supply and demand,\nthe rising importance of energy trade, and the longer-term future of shale. Overall, the\nconference attendees were relatively upbeat about the near-to-intermediate outlook for U.S. oil\nand gas, while recognizing that geopolitical risks could create volatility in the near term.4\n\nConclusion\nIn closing, the U.S. economy is enjoying a long expansion. One particular bright spot in\nthe outlook is the strength of the oil- and gas-producing sector. As we assess the outlook for the\neconomy as a whole, it has become increasingly important to understand developments in the\nenergy sector to identify industry-specific shocks and their possible spillovers to the broader\neconomy. The Kansas City Fed and its Oklahoma City Branch in particular will continue to\nkeep tabs on these energy sector dynamics.\nLooking ahead, there is good reason to expect continued moderate growth, with a gradual\nslowing to more sustainable growth rates of both output and employment. This outlook will\nlikely require further gradual increases in the FOMC’s target interest rate, although the pace and\nextent of future actions remain a key aspect of the Committee’s deliberations.\n\n4\n\nSee “Energy and the Economy: Charting the Course Ahead,” for presentations from the conference.\n\n8\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJuly 17, 2018\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Agricultural Symposium\nKansas City, Mo.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fGood evening and welcome. Today’s discussion has been both interesting and\ninformative. I want to thank the presenters and discussants for participating in this year’s\nsymposium. Clearly, international trade is central to the performance of the agricultural sector,\nand uncertainty about trade policy clouds the outlook. I look forward to continuing the\ndiscussion tomorrow.\nThis evening I would like to focus my remarks on the outlook for the U.S. economy and\nthe role of monetary policy in supporting sustainable economic growth. With the economy at or\nbeyond most estimates of full employment and inflation near the FOMC’s 2 percent objective,\nmonetary policy should be a neutral influence on the economy. However, in my view, policy is\nstill providing accommodation. Gradual further increases in our policy rate will be necessary to\nreturn policy to a neutral stance, although there is considerable uncertainty about exactly how far\nor fast we need to go. Thus, policy must thread the needle between moving too slowly toward\nneutral, which could lead to an undesirable increase in inflation, and moving too aggressively,\nwhich could precipitate an economic downturn.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\nLet me turn first to current economic conditions. The U.S. economy is in excellent shape,\noperating with tight labor markets and low and stable inflation. The unemployment rate at 4.0\npercent is well below most estimates of full employment. In addition, headline inflation as\nmeasured by the Fed’s preferred indicator, the personal consumption expenditure price index,\nrecently reached 2.3 percent, while the core measure excluding food and energy came in at 2\npercent—consistent with the Fed’s inflation objective.\n\n1\n\n\fLooking back at the first half of the year, real GDP—our broadest measure of economic\nactivity—increased at a solid pace. In fact, it accelerated from a moderate 2 percent annual rate\nin the first quarter to an expected growth rate of around 4 percent in the second quarter, based on\nvarious GDP tracking models. Looking ahead, we expect continued economic growth at or above\nestimates of the economy’s longer-run potential growth rate of around 1¾ percent.\nEconomic growth is broad based, and the economy appears to be firing on all cylinders.\nConsumer spending has supported overall economic growth since the beginning of the\nexpansion, but more recently, we have seen a pickup in business spending on plant and\nequipment. In addition, we are beginning to see an increase in the pace of wage gains. For\nexample, the employment cost index—a broad measure of labor compensation that accounts for\nemployment shifts among occupations and industries—accelerated over the past couple of years\nto a 2.7 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, after having hovered for several years\naround 2 percent. These wage gains along with ongoing increases in employment will continue\nto support increases in personal income and spending over the remainder of the year and on into\nnext year.\nWith this strong performance and a legacy of low interest rates, financial stress may be\nbuilding in some sectors. The corporate bond market and subprime borrowers appear to be at\nsome risk should interest rates rise sharply. In addition, asset prices remain elevated.\nNevertheless, regulators have judged the financial system to be stable, with manageable\nvulnerabilities. They point, for example, to the most recent assessment from the annual stresstesting of the largest banks. That said, I am concerned that regulators are not doing more to build\nresilient capital buffers into the banking system at a time of cyclical strength.\n\n2\n\n\fThe risks to the outlook\nAside from the possibility that we are misjudging the manageability of emerging\nfinancial imbalances, the risks to the outlook appear balanced. Even so, the risks—both to the\nupside and the downside—are significant.\nThe predominant upside risks in my view are a pro-cyclical U.S. fiscal policy and\nglobally accommodative monetary policies. While estimates of the stimulative effects vary, the\nfederal government’s actions to cut taxes and increase spending have come during a business\ncycle expansion. These policies may have the short-run benefit of promoting spending and,\nperhaps, increasing the economy’s longer-run growth potential by increasing business\ninvestment, but they also carry a risk of pushing the economy beyond its productive capacity.\nLikewise, accommodative monetary policies in the United States and other advanced economies\nencourage risk-taking and incentivize spending over saving. At this point in the business cycle,\nsuch fiscal and monetary policies could lead to an undesirable increase in inflation or to a further\nbuildup of financial imbalances.\nThe predominant downside risks come from uncertainty around trade policy. To date, the\nimpact of new tariffs on the broad economy has been minimal, and I have not incorporated any\nsignificant effect into my baseline outlook for the broader U.S. economy. However, anecdotal\nreports from our business contacts suggest that some companies are taking a “wait and see”\napproach to new capital spending due to uncertainty about future trade policies. Whether this\nwill materially slow the economy over the next couple of years or threaten the sustainability of\nthe expansion is something that I will be monitoring carefully.\n\n3\n\n\fMonetary policy must thread the needle\nBarring the realization of these risks to the outlook, I continue to believe the stance of\nmonetary policy will need to be gradually adjusted toward a more neutral position. At a time of\nfull employment with price stability, policy should be a neutral influence on economic activity.\nBut navigating the path to neutral will be challenging.\nIn the first place, there is considerable uncertainty about what the neutral policy rate is\nand, therefore, uncertainty about how many policy moves it will take to return to neutral. Various\nstructural changes—such as slower growth of the labor force and sluggish productivity growth—\nsuggest the neutral policy rate is lower than in the past. But other, cyclical, factors may be\npartially offsetting. In addition, fiscal stimulus is likely raising the neutral rate, but it is not clear\nby how much.\nLikewise, questions exist about the natural rate of unemployment and the slope of the\nPhillips curve—and whether these concepts remain relevant in today’s economy. The fact that\ninflation has been relatively stable even as the unemployment rate has fallen well below\nestimates of its longer-run sustainable level suggests that either the Phillips curve is unusually\nflat or, perhaps, obsolete. That said, monetary policy is currently testing the limits of how low\nunemployment can go without causing an undesirable increase in inflation.\nMonetary policy is further complicated by the extraordinary actions central banks took to\npromote growth during and after the global financial crisis. When unemployment was high and\ninflation was low relative to our targets, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) greatly\nexpanded the Fed’s balance sheet and provided forward guidance to the public that policy rates\nwould be kept low for a prolonged period. I don’t dispute that some of these policies may have\nhelped get us to where we are today. But now that the FOMC has largely achieved its objectives,\n\n4\n\n\fthe costs of these extraordinary policy actions are becoming apparent. Even though we have\nbegun to gradually normalize the size of the balance sheet, it remains exceptionally large by\nhistorical standards. It is still likely putting downward pressure on longer-term rates, working at\nodds with efforts to achieve policy neutrality. In addition, keeping rates “low for long” has\nresulted in a policy stance that remains accommodative in the face of tight labor markets and\ninflation at the FOMC’s goal.\nMoreover, traditional signals of the stance of policy, such as the slope of the yield curve,\nhave likely become distorted. A yield curve inversion—that is, a situation where short-term rates\nrise above longer-term rates—has historically been a strong signal that the economy might dip\ninto recession sometime over the next six months to two years. Except for once1, such an\ninversion has always been followed by a recession. While the yield curve has not yet inverted, it\nis relatively flat by historical standards, raising the possibility that further increases in policy\nrates could move them above longer-term rates.\nIt’s not clear how concerned we should be about this possibility. As I mentioned, the\nFed’s large holdings of Treasury securities may be keeping longer-term rates below where they\notherwise would be and, therefore, distorting the signal from the yield curve. In addition, the\nlevel of interest rates, as well as that of the neutral policy rate, is below historical benchmarks.2\nWhile economic conditions are quite positive right now, it is important that monetary\npolicy be calibrated over time to sustain the expansion. The stakes are high since policymakers\nwill have less scope to lower rates in a future downturn. Monetary policy cannot offset all of the\nshocks that affect the economy, and recessions will happen. But recessions can also be caused by\n\n1\n\nThe one time when an inverted yield curve (10-year treasury yield/3-month treasury yield) did not immediately\nprecede a recession was in September 1998.\n2\nBauer, Michael, and Thomas M. Mertens, “Economic Forecasts with the Yield Curve,” FRBSF Economic Letter,\nMarch 5, 2018.\n\n5\n\n\fpolicy mistakes. The FOMC will need to monitor incoming data carefully to avoid moving too\naggressively and causing a downturn or moving too slowly and allowing inflation to rise.\nAllowing inflation to rise also can result in a recession if the Fed must then raise rates\naggressively to return inflation to target.\nAdding to the complexity of monetary policy is that it affects the real economy with long\nand variable lags. Past policy actions have not yet had their full effect, and actions taken today\nwill not have their full effect for many months into the future. This raises the risk of\novershooting. Like adjusting the thermostat in a hot room to cool it down, failure to account for\nlags can lead one to continue tinkering with the controls. Because it takes time to reach the\ndesired temperature, if you’re not careful, it’s easy to overshoot, turning a room that is too hot\ninto one that is too cold.\nAll of this suggests to me that future policy actions will increasingly need to be data\ndependent. And given the policy lags, our actions need to be forward looking. In this context,\ndata dependence means that policymakers should adjust their forecasts and associated policy\npaths as necessary based on the flow of incoming data. Therefore, I will be monitoring signs that\nmight indicate whether we are nearing neutral or have further to go. For example, further\ndownward movements in the unemployment rate or upward momentum in inflation would\nsuggest to me that we have more work to do. On the other hand, stabilization of inflation and\nunemployment around their current levels might suggest less urgency for further policy action.\n\nConclusion\nNotwithstanding these challenges, the U.S. economy is currently in very good shape,\nunemployment is well below most estimates of its longer-run level, and inflation has moved up\n\n6\n\n\fto the FOMC’s objective. My baseline outlook is for the expansion to continue at a moderate\npace, while recognizing there are significant upside and downside risks. With a long-run view to\nsustain the expansion, monetary policy will need to move from an accommodative stance to a\nmore neutral stance. Threading this needle will be challenging in the face of numerous\nuncertainties and the ongoing complexity of unwinding the extraordinary policy actions taken in\nthe aftermath of the global financial crisis.\n\n7\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMay 4, 2018\nMonetary Policy and Reform in Practice\nThe Hoover Institution at Stanford University\nPalo Alto, Calif.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for the opportunity to offer my views on monetary policy and reform in\npractice. I appreciate the Hoover Institution bringing together leading academics and monetary\npolicymakers to share ideas about the practical issues facing central banks today. We have much\nto learn from each other.\nMy comments this afternoon focus on some of the practical issues I think about as I\nformulate my own policy views. As I do so, you’ll hear me describe these issues with more\nquestions than answers, reflecting the nature of the policy landscape today.\nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views and are not\nnecessarily representative of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday’s policy landscape\nNine years after the financial crisis, the Fed has, at least for the moment, achieved its\nobjectives of maximum employment and price stability. Yet the legacy of the crisis—through the\nresponse of the Fed and fiscal authorities—has left us in a very different place than before the\ncrisis in a number of ways. The equilibrium nominal policy rate is low by historical standards.\nThe current target for the federal funds rate is considerably lower than the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) projection of its longer-run value. Our balance sheet is almost five times\nits pre-crisis size. The Fed’s footprint in financial markets is considerably larger than before the\ncrisis. The banking sector is consolidating, and big banks have gotten even bigger. Federal\ndeficits and debt are high and projected to rise to unprecedented levels.\nDespite this legacy, many of the structural developments that dominate our thinking\ntoday were well underway before the onset of the financial crisis and Great Recession. An aging\npopulation, slowing productivity growth, rising globalization and declining equilibrium interest\n\n1\n\n\frates all pre-date the crisis. In this sense, things have not changed. Moreover, since the mid1990s and through the financial crisis, Great Recession, and current expansion, core inflation—\nas measured by the personal consumption expenditure price index—has fluctuated in a relatively\nnarrow range of roughly 1 percent to 2 ½ percent.\nGiven the structural changes that have been developing over the last several decades, it\nmay well be that we are in a low-growth, low-interest-rate environment. Yet, from a cyclical\nperspective, the economy appears to be operating at or beyond full employment with inflation\nexpected to rise over the medium term, while the FOMC’s funds rate target of 1½ percent to 1¾\npercent remains well below the FOMC’s projection of its longer-run level of about 3 percent.\nThe current gradual normalization of interest rates is geared toward removing accommodation at\na pace that is expected to sustain the expansion without generating undesired increases in\ninflation on the one hand, or creating financial instability on the other. But there are clearly risks.\nAnd there are still uncertainties about how the landscape will look once policy has\nachieved a “new normal.” In particular, questions remain to be answered about the Fed’s future\noperating framework, its strategic framework and its role in promoting financial stability. I’ll\ndiscuss each of these issues in turn.\n\nDetermining a long-run operating framework\nIn 2016, the FOMC held lengthy discussions about potential long-run frameworks for\nmonetary policy implementation. The Committee discussed the merits of maintaining an\nabundance of reserves in the banking system versus returning to a framework of reserve scarcity.\nWith an abundance of reserves, the Fed would rely on interest on reserves and the overnight\nreverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) to maintain control over short-term market rates. With\n\n2\n\n\fa scarcity of reserves, the open market desk at the New York Fed would control market rates\nthrough its control over the supply of reserves. The discussion ended with agreement that\n“decisions regarding the long-run implementation framework were not necessary at this time.”1\nSince that time, however, we have begun to normalize our balance sheet with an understanding\nthat the balance sheet will be smaller than it is today, but larger than it was in 2007. As the\nbalance sheet continues its steady decline, I would suggest that we again need to consider the\nappropriate long-run size of the balance sheet and our related operating framework.\nWhile it may simply be a case of nostalgia on my part, I found our minimalist pre-crisis\noperating framework to have a number of features that served us well for many years. We\nmaintained a small balance sheet with liabilities that were comprised almost entirely of currency\nin circulation with reserves averaging about $10 billion, compared with more than $2 trillion\ntoday. We maintained a Treasuries-only balance sheet with duration-matching Treasury issuance\nto maintain a neutral influence on financial markets. We had a small number of counterparties,\nand we managed the supply of reserves to achieve the target federal funds rate. As a result, our\nfootprint in the financial markets was relatively small.\nRelative to this pre-crisis framework, the current operating framework—made necessary\nby a large balance sheet—has had a number of undesirable consequences, some of which were\nunintended. The Fed now owns significant outstanding shares of Treasuries and mortgagebacked securities (MBS) and is no longer a neutral influence on financial markets. We have a\nlarge number of counterparties, including nonbanks, made necessary by the ON RRP facility.\nIncreases in the funds rate are achieved by raising an administered rate—the interest rate on\nexcess reserves (IOER). Some have expressed concern that as IOER goes up, payments to\nbanks—including to foreign banks—go up. Finally, the nature of unconventional policies has\n1\n\nFederal Open Market Committee Minutes, November 1-2, 2016.\n\n3\n\n\fdrawn both attention and criticism to the Federal Reserve’s large balance sheet with conequences\nfor central bank independence and fiscal discipline. Congress has begun to see the Federal\nReserve as a source for plugging spending gaps, drawing on the Fed to fund the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, finance highway spending, and more recently, to contribute $2.5\nbillion to the federal government from its capital surplus as part of the budget deal passed in\nFebruary after the brief government shutdown.\nGiven these developments, the current thrust of policy can become more difficult to\ngauge. At the same time the funds rate is being normalized, we have embarked on a program to\ngradually reduce the Fed’s security holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments.\nWhile I support this policy—with balance sheet normalization occurring largely on auto-pilot\nand in the background—it does pose challenges as we try to understand the implications for the\nstance of policy. Is policy tighter than we think because the balance sheet is shrinking? Or is the\nstill-large balance sheet putting downward pressure on longer-term rates making policy more\naccommodative than we think?\nWhether it is desirable or even possible to return to our pre-crisis operating framework\nremains an open question for the FOMC. Can we return to the corridor-like framework with\nscarce reserves, or will we need to retain the current floor system? If we maintain the current\nsystem, by how much can we reduce the supply of reserves? And what is the eventual role of the\nON RRP facility? Can IOER guide the funds rate without reliance on the floor established by the\nrate on ON RRPs? Answers to these questions will be shaped by the FOMC’s future discussions.\n\n4\n\n\fStrategic framework\nIn addition to uncertainties about the longer-run operating framework, a number of\nstrategic challenges and uncertainties pose practical issues for policymakers. With little\ncountercyclical policy space available to respond to a future downturn, monetary policy options\nmust contemplate how interest rate and balance sheet policies will work before, during and after\na crisis. Aggressively purchasing assets in a downturn and only gradually allowing them to roll\noff once the economy has fully recovered suggests the possibility of a balance sheet that grows\nbigger and bigger over time.\nThis dynamic, combined with varying degrees of uncertainty about the efficacy of asset\npurchases, has led to calls for a discussion about future policy strategies for the next encounter\nwith the zero lower bound. Ideas like price-level targeting, a higher inflation objective or\nnominal GDP targeting all offer worthwhile and intellectually stimulating debate. And certainly\nthe time is right to consider the trade-offs around various strategies, but determining if these\nideas might work in practice is challenging.\n\nPromoting Financial Stability\nThese uncertainties make it all the more important to ensure the current economic\nexpansion is sustained as interest rates rise and the balance sheet normalizes. We should take\nevery measure possible to prevent a crisis rather than hope that we can devise a monetary policy\ncure after the fact.\n\n5\n\n\fAs the FOMC gradually moves away from the zero lower bound, with a slowly shrinking\nbut still-large balance sheet and growing federal debt, maintaining financial stability is\nparamount.\nHere I would like to make two key points.\n\n\nFirst, in contemplating a future bout of financial instability, we should be realistic\nabout the robustness of macroprudential tools with a good dose of humility\naround the necessary finesse to deploy them in a timely fashion.\n\n\n\nSecond, we should not waver in our aims to bolster resilience in our banking\nsystem especially for the largest banks.2\n\nThere is little dispute that financial stability is a necessary condition for achieving the\nFOMC’s employment and price stability mandates. It is recognized in the FOMC’s “Statement of\nLonger-Run Goals and Strategies” as well as being the objective of macroprudential policies.\nHowever, there remains a tension as to the trade-off between macroeconomic goals and financial\nstability. The “lean or clean” debate is ongoing. Specifically, some argue that the output losses\nassociated with using monetary policy to lean against growing financial imbalances far outweigh\nthe possible benefits. Instead, they suggest that macroprudential policies are the appropriate\nresponse to financial instability. In my view, this approach might be more effective in theory\nthan in practice.\nA few years ago, I participated with some of my colleagues in a tabletop exercise\ndesigned to assess the efficacy of certain macroprudential policy tools in responding to a\nhypothetical financial crisis. In the exercise, we examined the use of capital-based, liquiditybased, and credit-based tools, along with stress testing and supervisory guidance in mitigating\n\n2\n\nThe eight U.S. global systemically important banks (GSIBs) held $11 trillion in total assets at the end of 2017, an\namount equal to 57 percent of U.S. gross domestic product.\n\n6\n\n\fthe effects of an overheating of the financial markets. What we discovered in conducting the\nexercise was that the effectiveness of the tools varied because of realities like implementation\nlags and/or limited scope. In addition, monetary policy looked to be a relatively more attractive\noption than some might have expected before the exercise.3 Obviously this particular exercise is\nnot conclusive in all scenarios, but rather a caution about becoming overly confident in relying\non macroprudential tools to address growing financial imbalances.\nIn thinking about the role of financial stability in the conduct of monetary policy, I find\nrecent research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to be compelling. This\nresearch sees financial market deregulation from the 1980s and 1990s as having increased the\nlikelihood of crises and posits a growing financial cycle in which monetary policy responds\nasymmetrically over time to crises, easing rates aggressively during the crisis but raising rates\nonly gradually after the crisis has subsided. Their prescription is for policymakers to break this\ncycle by making policy more attentive to financial imbalances and more symmetrical in the\nresponse.4\nWe should take advantage of the current economic conditions to bolster resilience in the\nfinancial system. Instead, the U.S. has yet to implement a countercyclical buffer and the banking\nagencies contemplate steps in the direction of relaxing capital requirements. Recently issued for\ncomment is a proposal to modify the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio on global\nsystemically important banks (GSIBs) that would have the effect of lowering capital\nrequirements.5 With the U.S. economy in a sustained expansion and at risk of growing financial\n3\n\nTobias Adrian, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “Macro-prudential Policy: A Case Study\nfrom a Tabletop Exercise,” FRBNY Economic Policy Review, February 2017.\n4\nClaudio Borio, Piti Disyatat, Mikael Juselius, and Phurichai Rungcharoenkitkul, “Monetary Policy in the Grip of a\nPincer Movement,” BIS Working Paper No. 706.\n5\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2018. “Rule Proposed to Tailor 'Enhanced Supplementary\nLeverage Ratio' Requirements.” Press release, April 11.

I hope we do so before we find ourselves cleaning up after the\nnext crisis.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "Statement of FDIC Vice Chairman Hoenig\non the Semi-Annual Update of the Global Capital Index\nApril 25, 2018\nThe Global Capital Index (GCI), released today by FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig, shows the largest\nU.S. banks reporting higher capital ratios at year-end 2017. The U.S. G-SIBs’ average IFRS tangible\nleverage ratio estimate — a measure of tangible equity funding a bank’s assets — increased to 6.92\npercent, up from 6.62 percent in June 2017. However, these results reflect two important events that\noccurred during 2017 that affected the different leverage ratios for the largest banks reported in the\nGCI.\nFirst was the adoption by the largest banks of the clearinghouses’ settle-to-market (STM) rule change for\ncertain centrally cleared derivatives transactions that treats the exchange of variation margin as a\nsettlement rather than collateral.1 The accounting impact of this rule change results in the\nderecognition of gross balances of the netted derivative assets, liabilities and associated collateral\ndisclosed in a firm’s financial statements. This is estimated to have reduced the reported off-balance\nsheet derivative exposure by approximately $845 billion for the U.S. G-SIBs from year-end 2016 to yearend 2017.2 Without this change, their IFRS tangible leverage ratio estimate drops 44 basis points to 6.48\npercent. Second, the largest U.S. GSIBs distributed 125 percent of earnings to shareholders through\ndividends and share buybacks for the full year 2017. 3\n“The STM rule change allows banks to derecognize these assets and liabilities in their financial\nstatements allowing capital to appear greater relative to assets when including off balance sheet risk,\nwhen no real increase in capital has occurred,” Vice Chairman Hoenig said. “The implications can\neventually become profound especially as these banks ramp up capital distributions, as we saw in 2008\nwhen the true capital position of the largest banks became painfully revealed”.\nAlthough the adoption of STM represents a significant easing in capital requirements, U.S. G-SIBs\ncontinue to benefit from their better capitalized and financially stronger position than their counterparts\nacross the globe. U.S. G-SIBs continue to trade at a premium of 1.41 to book value, while their European\nand Canadian counterparts trade at a median discount to book of 0.89 and Asian counterparts are\ntrading at 0.67.\n###\nThe Global Capital Index can be found at https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/global.html\n\n1\n\nStatement of FDIC Vice Chairman Hoenig on the Capital Treatment of Derivatives and Variation Margin\n- https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/speeches/spaug1417.html\n2\nSTM treats the exchange of variation margin as a settlement instead of collateral and resets the value\nof those derivatives to zero. Financial statements generally footnote the gross balances. Adding this\nexposure back results in the much lower IFRS estimated tangible leverage ratio and a more accurate\nreflection of the reliance on debt.\n3\nCapital Distribution Tracker - https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/capitaldisttracker.pdf\n\n\fThe Global Capital Index relies on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to measure a firm's\ntangible equity (loss-absorbing capital) against a more complete reporting of derivative exposures, as\nshown in Column 7 of the table. The largest financial institutions continue to reference their risk\nweighted capital ratios (Column 3) rather than their tangible equity capital ratios (Column 8) to suggest\nthey are well capitalized. However, this higher number occurs because assumed risk weighted assets\nrepresent only 51 percent of total assets measured under IFRS. The net effect is to reduce assets used in\ncomputing the risk based ratio, thus overstating the true equity capital available to absorb losses relative\nto the total risk of on- and off-balance-sheet exposures.\n\n\f"

            "content": "\"Finding the Right Balance\"\nKeynote speech by FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig presented to\nthe Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, DC\nMarch 28, 2018\nIntroduction\nOver Fourth of July weekend in 1982, I was the officer in charge of lending at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Our week had begun with “the phone call” from a\npanicked banker whose institution was experiencing a serious liquidity problem. The\nbank’s funding sources, mostly deposits and upstream purchasers of its energy loans,\nhad lost confidence and were running. Then, reminiscent of a scene from the Great\nDepression, lines had formed outside the bank as depositors demanded their money\nback, having heard rumors that the institution was in trouble. The Reserve Bank\nprovided some replacement funding through its discount operations with the goal of\nbuying time to determine whether the bank was solvent and, if so, whether it had\nsufficient collateral to lend against. Ultimately, the bank, Penn Square National Bank,\nmet neither test. It had too little capital and its assets were too distressed to offer any\nhope of survival. The bank was closed that holiday weekend.\nIn the end, Penn Square, through its model of originate to distribute, contributed to the\nlargest bank failure in U.S. history at the time with the collapse of Continental Illinois\nNational Bank. However, because Continental was then the fifth-largest U.S. bank and\nbecause numerous creditors would have taken significant losses if it had failed,\nregulators chose to bail it out. Thus began Too Big to Fail as a policy option in the United\nStates.\nI tell this story because it illustrates just how little has changed over the past almost 40\nyears. Events since then have included the S & L crisis, the Mexican Peso crisis, the Asian\nfinancial crisis, the Russian financial crisis and failure of Long-Term Capital Management,\nand, of course, the Great Recession and the Greek sovereign debt crisis. Each crisis has\nits own personality but what is often ignored is that the fundamental elements almost\nnever change.\nThe elements include a significant change in monetary policy—a crucial but inherently\nblunt instrument with far-reaching effects; a significant ramping up of leveraged assets;\nand management that displays a degree of confidence that repeatedly proves\nunjustified. On the other side, they too often include supervisors who lack the\nconfidence or are so convinced of management’s talents that they fail to challenge\n\n\fquestionable executive behavior.\nAnother common element of most crises is the aftermath, in which new laws and\nregulations are enacted with the intent to prevent new crises. But memories are short\nand with an improving economy, these laws and regulations—which early in the\nrecovery are viewed as essential—are eventually recast as burdensome constraints that\nneed to be eased or ended.\nAnd here we are again. After years of slow recovery, the U.S. economy is booming and\nthe call for regulatory relief is loud. This is the case despite changing monetary policy,\nincreasingly volatile markets, increasing economic leverage, and changing risk profiles of\nsome of our largest institutions. Still, standards of living are on the rise. Indeed, U.S.\ngross domestic product (GDP) is projected to approach a 3 percent growth rate this\nyear. While in flux, both monetary and fiscal policy are accommodative. As you would\nexpect, the banking industry is an important part of this success, generating $165 billion\nof income in 2017, a near record high.\nConsidering this history, I want to take this opportunity, as I step away from my role at\nthe FDIC, to outline an approach for providing meaningful regulatory relief without\nundermining the goal of assuring sound banking. The recommendations are founded on\nmy confidence in markets and in their ability to deliver consistent economic growth. But\nthere is a trade-off. Success requires that the rules which remain to assure that markets\nwork include proven prudential standards that are enforced rigorously and complied\nwith consistently. These standards include strong capital and wise constraints on a\nbank’s reliance on the government’s safety net. With such a foundation in place, a\nnumber of costly administrative rules that create burden with little benefit can be\nremoved or minimized.\nPrudential Standards and Success\nToday, the U.S. banking industry is better capitalized than that of most other major\nindustrial countries.i Better capitalized banks lend more, promote economic growth and\nfinancial stability, and provide the necessary confidence for the world to invest in them.\nIn fact, throughout the modern era, the United States has fostered and sustained a\nstrong and highly influential banking system that is the envy of the world. From this\nstrength, U.S. banks are again reporting near-record profits.\nAs bank profits have grown, so too have their appetite for risk and their dislike for\nregulations that constrain that appetite. They also are frustrated with rules that impose\nthousands of pages of administrative processes and unproductive costs onto their\noperations. The challenge is to eliminate those rules that impose a real administrative\nburden from those that set performance standards that allow properly gauged and\npriced risks onto the balance sheet. The former rules create needless barriers to bank\ncompetition and fall disproportionately on the different segments of the industry, while\n\n\flong-proven prudential standards promote responsible performance and are key to\nmeaningful deregulation.\nWith that thought, I would ask the following question: If one of the most common\nelements of recurring crises is excess leverage; if careful study and analysis by leading\nscholars suggest that a 15 percent equity-to-assets capital ratio significantly reduces the\nlikelihood of failure with only the smallest of increase in lending cost; and if prior\nperiods show that the market demands 10 percent capital or more when government\nguarantees are unavailable, then why shouldn’t a capital ratio of 10 percent equity to\ntotal assets be the minimum standard for every bank wishing to operate in the United\nStates?ii\nThe answer I get most often is that insisting on stronger capital levels raises the cost of\ncapital and holds back economic growth. This view is repeated despite the many studies\nshowing the opposite: that stronger bank capital contributes to stronger, more\nsustainable economic growth through a business cycle. iii\nWe know that when the business cycle shifts and losses materialize, the absence of\ncapital intensifies the downturn as the market suspects there is not sufficient capital to\nabsorb the shock and it worries about bank insolvency suddenly becoming real. For\nexample, going into the last crisis the largest banks had 3 percent tangible equity capital\nand their losses in 2008 approached 6 percent. In circumstances like that lenders must\npull back, liquidity dissipates at an accelerating pace, and fear gathers momentum. The\nmagnitude of the shock spills over into the broader economy where it can severely\naffect Main Street. Thus, it is not credible to base public policy on the assumption that\nunrestrained leverage accelerates economic growth without serious consequences for\nwhich ownership, not the public, should be accountable.\nTherefore, I caution strongly against eroding the post-crisis capital standards that have\ncontributed to the strength of U.S. banks and the long-awaited recovery of the U.S.\neconomy. Weakening these standards will undermine the long-term resilience of not\nonly the banking system, but the broader economy as well.\nFor example, reducing the capital requirements of the most systemically important\nbanks by excluding central bank reserves from the supplemental leverage ratio (SLR) is a\nserious policy mistake. Measures on the table to do so would excuse primarily the\ncustody bank business model from holding as much capital per assets as all other banks.\nWhat should be remembered is that custody banks are integral to the financial system,\nhighly interconnected to the capital markets, and relied upon as safe havens in times of\nstress. How unfortunate that during the last crisis these custody banks were seriously\nundercapitalized and as confidence in them ebbed, the government found itself\nsupporting them under emergency conditions at levels reaching $60 billion to $90 billion\na day. These trusted custodians must remain pillars of strength and should be retaining\ncapital, not reducing it.\n\n\fThere also is some effort underway to try to relax the SLR’s treatment of initial margin.\nBecause banks that act as a clearing agent for their clients also guarantee their clients’\nexposures to the various clearinghouses without limit, removing initial margin from the\nexposure calculation of the SLR ultimately shifts the burden of the guarantee onto the\npublic.\nAdditionally, it concerns me that the U.S. regulatory agencies have joined the recent\nBasel Committee agreement that, according to some estimates, could remove as much\nas $145 billion of capital from the eight largest banking firms. This is counterproductive.\nAs I noted earlier, the U.S. banking system is stronger than that of any other region.\nEven with tangible equity at only 6.62 percent of total assets plus the fair value of\nderivatives, the market has come to rely most heavily on U.S. banks over their less wellcapitalized foreign peers. Also, U.S. bank stocks are trading at premiums with an average\nprice-to-book ratio of 1.4. In contrast, foreign banks trade at an average ratio well below\n1, a reflection of their lower capital and poorly priced risks.\nShould the U.S. banking agencies embrace the Basel standard, the reduction in private\ncapital would necessarily be underwritten by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and then\nthe taxpayer. As an example, one bank that received more than $100 billion dollars of\ncapital and liquidity support in the last financial crisis would be free to reduce its capital\nby 30 percent under the new Basel accord. The United States should not engage in this\nrace to the bottom.\nThe second prudential standard that serves to mitigate mispriced risk in the financial\nsystem is the Volcker Rule. With the introduction and expansion of the government\nsafety net, a side effect is the issue of moral hazard. For example, in the build-up to the\nlast crisis some banks relied on their insured status to engage in speculative proprietary\ntrading and to organize hedge fund activities. When the crisis erupted, many of the\nassets had to be repurchased and brought onto their balance sheets, becoming, in\neffect, part of the bailout. That is why the Volcker Rule was then implemented to\ncontain these practices in the future.\nIts purpose appropriately is to limit the use of deposit insurance to fund speculative\ntrading and related activities, and that should not be compromised for any group of\nbanks. With that said, the application of the Volcker Rule can be greatly simplified.\nCommercial banks should be free to enter into swaps and other derivatives to\naccommodate loan customers or hedge their own risks. And they should be free to buy\nand sell government securities and manage their day-to-day liquidity needs. To\naccommodate this need, I suggest such activities be entitled to a presumption of\ncompliance with zero additional reporting requirements, unless compelling evidence to\nthe contrary is identified during the normal supervisory process.\nWith meaningful reporting relief in effect the burden would be eased, so rather than\n\n\fcarve out exceptions, the Volcker Rule should continue to apply to all banks that benefit\nfrom deposit insurance. For the largest banks that engage in market making and trading,\nthere should be the additional requirement that their CEOs attest in their confidence\nthat procedures are in place and tested to assure compliance.\nAdditional Regulatory Relief and G-SIBs\nWith strong prudential standards in place, reflecting ownership’s greater role in\nabsorbing the risk its banks take on, the opportunity for regulatory relief for the largest\nfirms increases. One candidate for such relief is the living will and its administrative\nprocess.\nThe living will process is cumbersome, political, and misleading. Annual preparation is\ncostly to both bank and regulator. Once written, it provides little new information as it is\nsubmitted and resubmitted each year. Most of what is learned is available through the\nexamination process and the annual stress test. Eliminating or extending the reporting\ncycle would reduce bank and regulatory costs with access to information no less\navailable.\nUnfortunately, given the size and scope of these banks’ activities and their global reach\nthey remain Too Big to Fail regardless of the paper exercise. And, the living will process\nmay be having the unintended result of institutionalizing that effect. For example, with\nencouragement from regulators, the largest banking firms have adopted single point of\nentry (SPOE) as a resolution strategy. This assumes that operating companies remain\nopen through a crisis. Should it be necessary, these companies will have creditors, in the\nform of Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC), to recapitalize the banks and, if needed,\nthey will have access to liquidity from the Treasury. However, this approach also has the\neffect of signaling that creditors of operating units will be able to get out of their\nposition, which effectively is a bailout. The largest banking firms should be subject to\nbankruptcy, but the evidence suggests that the living will is unlikely to achieve that goal.\nAdditionally, since SPOE trades process for substance and TLAC substitutes debt for\nequity capital, these administrative approaches promote bailouts.\nThe point is that the imposition of administrative rules and regulations that substitute\nfor long-tested and more reliable prudential standards is a poor tradeoff. We can do\nwith far fewer rules if we have a clear expectation that private ownership and\nsubstantial private capital, not taxpayer funding, will minimize the likelihood of crisis\nand its effects should it occur.\nRegulatory Relief and Regional and Community Banks\nTo an important degree, community and regional banks are better positioned for\nregulatory relief than the largest banking firms. For example, regional commercial\n\n\fbanks, even the biggest among them, do not engage in the same breadth of risk\nactivities as G-SIBs. There are more than 5,600 banks in the United States, of which 35\nare G-SIBs or their affiliates. Unlike the G-SIBs, the remaining banks have far less than 10\npercent trading as a percentage of total assets, and most of them have 8 percent or\nmore equity to assets. That’s 95 percent of all U.S. commercial banks.\nFor these banks I have suggested a substantial list of rules that should be reviewed for\nelimination or simplification. The list includes the Basel capital calculations and\ncompliance, liquidity rules, and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). It\nalso includes rules already under legislative review, such as appraisal requirements,\nexamination cycles, and consumer rules regarding the collection of HMDA data. As\ndescribed earlier, I also have recommended simplification of the Volcker Rule .\nSuch changes represent real regulatory relief. They would reduce the demand on bank\nmanagement’s time and strengthen the business of banking within their communities.\nThis is the goal I believe we all seek, and these recommendations provide one possible\nand solid path toward achieving it.\nConclusion\nI want to finish by noting that the failure to better understand the nature and disparate\neffect of regulations on the industry will be to increase the costs of banking and\nencourage ever-greater consolidation of the industry. Prudential standards strengthen\nperformance, while administrative procedural rules raise new barriers, increase costs,\nand discriminate against banks that are less able to absorb those costs. As recently as\n1984, the 10 largest banking firms held about 17 percent of industry assets. Today, the\neight U.S. G-SIBs own only 20 banks but control about 50 percent of bank assets.\nMoreover, when all of their financial activities—which include commercial and\ninvestment banking, trust activities, trading, and safekeeping—are added together, the\nindividual financial footprint of the four largest banks exceeds U.S. GDP of $18.6\ntrillion. iv Their combined footprint exceeds world GDP of $75.8 trillion by nearly 40\npercent. This consolidation story also suggests that Too Big to Fail remains more a factor\ntoday than even in 2008 with the advent of that crisis, which serves to further guarantee\nmore consolidation.\nA stronger banking industry relying on sufficient private capital to manage through the\ncycles of the economy will be a freer industry, where management can structure its\nbalance sheet based on its strategic business model rather than government\nrequirements that predefine capital, liquidity, and resolution needs. This would go a\nlong way to returning market discipline. Regulation could focus on prudential standards\nand less on large-scale government-mandated administrative exercises.\nI suspect we will always have a Federal Reserve Bank loan officer getting that dreaded\nphone call, where the banker on the other end is desperate for help in addressing a\n\n\fliquidity crisis. But I would prefer it be less often than in recent years and from an\ninstitution that really only needs help with liquidity, not with solvency and a bailout.\n###\nThomas M.

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMarch 8, 2018\nEconomic Forum\nLincoln, NE\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fI’m pleased to be in Lincoln with members of our Omaha Branch office board of\ndirectors. As a regional Federal Reserve Bank president, I gain important insights about the\neconomic landscape of our District from visits like this one, where I have the opportunity to meet\nwith business and community leaders. Your comments and concerns about the economy,\ncombined with economic data and analysis, help inform my own views on monetary policy.\nMy remarks this evening will focus on the state of the economy and the current stance of\nmonetary policy. In particular, I want to highlight some key dynamics of the labor market, as we\nare experiencing the confluence of several cyclical and structural trends that are collectively\nreshaping the job market in Nebraska and the nation as a whole.\nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views and are not\nnecessarily representative of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Nebraska Economy\nAs we heard earlier tonight, the Nebraska economy is relatively strong and its\nunemployment rate is historically low. I’d like to use the lens of the labor market to describe the\nopportunities and challenges that the state faces as you collectively work to build and support a\nstrong economy.\nRelative to the nation, Nebraska has a strong labor market with an unemployment rate\nbelow the U.S. national average. Just over a decade ago, prior to the financial crisis, Nebraska\nhad an unemployment rate of about 3 percent. Following the financial crisis and during the\nrecession that ensued, Nebraska’s unemployment rate rose to about 5 percent, far less than the\nnational unemployment rate, which rose to 10 percent. And at this current point in the ongoing\n\n2\n\n\feconomic expansion, Nebraska’s unemployment rate is 2.7 percent, suggesting that the labor\nmarket is tighter now across the state than it was back in 2007.\nThis is very good news for the state as a whole, but it masks several underlying trends\nthat reveal that this improvement has not been experienced equally across all parts of the state\nand for all workers in the economy. Within Nebraska, employment growth has been\nconcentrated in metro areas, particularly in Omaha and Lincoln, while the rural parts of the state\nhave struggled. During the past four years, employment in Nebraska’s metro areas has grown at\nan annual rate of 1.5 percent, while in that same time there has been no employment growth in\nnon-metro areas of the state. This widening divide of economic opportunities between rural and\nmetro areas represents a growing concern for our region and is a topic that the research staff at\nthe Kansas City Fed will be analyzing.\nA second important trend that has broad implications for Nebraska’s economy is the\nongoing demographic shift in its population. During the past decade, Nebraska’s population of\nindividuals age 16 and above has grown by 8 percent. But a large share of this population, the\nbaby boomers, are moving toward retirement, which implies that the labor force of available\nworkers may not be growing as quickly. In fact, the number of prime-age individuals in\nNebraska, those aged 25 to 54, has actually declined by 3½ percent over the past decade. If this\ntrend continues with an aging population that is not fully replaced by the next generation of\nworkers, this will create a significant headwind for growth prospects for the state economy.\nAnd a third trend influencing the labor market is the ongoing shift in the types of skills\nemployers demand. In the past 40 years, advances in technology and computing, along with\nshifts toward an increasingly global economy, have dramatically altered the employment\nopportunities that firms are seeking to fill. Jobs that were available in the past to workers with a\n\n3\n\n\fhigh school degree, such as assembly line work in manufacturing plants and clerical jobs in\noffices, have largely been automated. As those jobs have gone away, new jobs have emerged,\nbut many require technical skills that workers need to obtain through training programs or\nadvanced education.\nHow best to prepare our youth and young workers for success in this economy is a\nchallenge facing Nebraska, along with the rest of the country. In particular, young men are\nstruggling to adapt to this shift in employment opportunities. A recent article in the Kansas City\nFed’s Economic Review by Didem Tüzemen describes how this shift has contributed to an\nincreased number of prime-age men who are leaving the labor force.1 Those men typically have\nonly a high school diploma and perhaps some college education. For Nebraska, the share of\nprime-age men who are actively engaged in the labor force has declined by 1 percent during the\npast decade, which implies that approximately 10,000 men who would have been working in\nNebraska’s economy a decade ago are now sitting on the sidelines and not looking for work\nbecause their skills are not in demand by employers.\nBut this is also a national dilemma with no easy answers. In addition to the slowdown in\nthe growth rate of the labor force due to the retirement of baby boomers, the missing prime-age\nmale workers are another headwind on the national economy’s productive capacity.\nLet me turn now to the outlook for the U.S. economy which, from a cyclical perspective,\nlooks very robust, aside from this very challenging issue.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\n\n1\n\nTüzemen, Didem. “Why Are Prime-Age Men Vanishing from the Labor Force?” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity. Economic Review, First Quarter, 2018.\n\n4\n\n\fAlmost nine years into the current expansion, the U.S. economy has, by most accounts,\nachieved full employment while maintaining a low and stable inflation rate. Preliminary\nestimates suggest that real GDP — our broadest measure of economic activity — grew at an\nannual rate of just under 3 percent in the second half of last year. Looking ahead, most\nforecasters expect continued moderate growth somewhat above the economy’s potential growth\nrate of roughly 1¾ percent to 2 percent. Such growth will likely lead to tighter conditions in\nlabor and product markets and, possibly, higher inflation. As a result, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee—the Fed’s monetary policymaking body—has been gradually removing monetary\naccommodation by slowly increasing its target interest rate and allowing its balance sheet to\nshrink.\nThat’s my outlook in a nutshell. Let me now provide some details in support of my\nperspective.\nOne of the key drivers of the expansion has been consumer spending. Consumers\nmaintained a moderate pace of spending during this economic expansion, generally in line with\nthe moderate pace of income growth we have been seeing. Looking forward, I expect consumers\nto continue providing a significant amount of support for this economic expansion, as jobs\ncontinue to be added and wage growth is beginning to pick up in response to a tightening labor\nmarket. Recent changes to personal taxes will likely provide a modest boost to household\nspending this year and allow households to pay down debt, which has continued to grow\nthroughout the expansion. Over time, the contribution of the tax plan to consumer spending is\nlikely to fade, but still remain positive for spending as labor market conditions tighten.\nAdditional momentum to the economy has come from business spending on plant and\nequipment. Business investment grew almost 6¼ percent in 2017, which represents a welcome\n\n5\n\n\fstep up from the negligible rate of growth during the previous three years. Equipment\ninvestment in particular has strengthened in response to stronger global demand for U.S.\nmanufactured goods and commodities. In the last four quarters, it grew almost 9 percent.\nLooking ahead, the lower corporate tax rate and more favorable tax treatment of\ninvestment spending are expected to provide a further modest boost to business spending in the\ncoming years. Longer-term factors, however, such as sluggish productivity growth and a\nsubdued rate of growth in the working-age population, are likely to remain a drag on investment\nspending going forward. Intangible investment, such as in intellectual property and\ntechnological know-how, is likely to continue growing in importance relative to investment in\nphysical structures and machinery.\nThe housing sector presents more of a mixed picture, with residential investment\nfluctuating around a moderate upward trend that is likely to persist. Construction activity is\nconstrained by a shortage of qualified workers, difficulty obtaining financing by small builders,\nand the limited availability of undeveloped land in desired locations. Single-family sales are\nbeing significantly constrained by limited home listings. In contrast, demand for housing remains\nvery strong. Many young adults who moved in with their parents or found housemates following\nthe Great Recession would now like to form their own households but are finding a lack of\nmoderately-priced apartments and houses. Similarly, families who would like to upgrade from\nstarter single-family homes are also finding a limited number of homes available for sale. With\nstrong demand but limited new supply, rents and sales prices are likely to continue to move up\nbriskly, even as mortgage rates normalize from the very low levels of recent years.\n\n6\n\n\fFinally, the national economy will get a small boost in growth from federal government\nspending. The two-year budget agreement that Congress recently passed raises spending caps\nfor fiscal year 2018 and 2019, allowing nearly $400 billion in additional spending.\nWith this outlook, I view inflation dynamics as broadly consistent with the Federal\nReserve’s goal of price stability. Year-over-year inflation is currently running just under the\nFederal Reserve’s objective of 2 percent as measured by the personal consumption expenditure\nprice index. But I would expect to see inflation rising this year to around 2 percent. This\nincrease reflects continued economic growth at or above its long-run potential, a further\ntightening of labor markets, and rising import prices stemming from strong global demand.\nRisks to the outlook appear to be predominately to the upside. The sectors that were\nheadwinds on growth in the final quarter of last year suggest considerable momentum going into\nthe current year. Imports, which subtracted almost 2 percentage points from the fourth quarter\ngrowth rate, point to considerable domestic demand. Likewise, inventories, which subtracted 0.7\npercentage point from overall economic growth, should be a source of strength this year as\nproducers restock their shelves. In addition, as I will discuss in a moment, monetary policy\nremains highly accommodative, and the recently enacted tax cuts and federal government\nspending increases suggest fiscal policy has turned more stimulative. On top of these domestic\ndemand factors, a synchronized global recovery, in which foreign demand for our goods and\nservices ,remains quite solid, should contribute to the momentum going forward.\n\nMonetary policy\nLet me now turn to a review of monetary policy. Although we have largely achieved our\nobjectives for maximum employment and price stability, the stance of monetary policy remains\n\n7\n\n\fquite accommodative. The federal funds rate, which is the overnight interest rate the Federal\nReserve targets, remains well below estimates of its longer-run value of around 3 percent.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet remains extraordinarily large by\nhistorical standards due to the FOMC’s large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury and\nagency debt beginning in 2008. These programs, commonly referred as quantitative easing or\nQE, ended in October 2014, and the process of shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet to reduce our\nholdings of Treasury and agency securities started last fall. By the end of this year, however,\nonly about a quarter of the increase to the Fed’s balance sheet resulting from the first round of\nlarge scale asset purchases will be unwound.\nThese holdings of longer-term assets were intended to put downward pressure on longerterm interest rates. Many investors responded, as would be expected, by purchasing riskier\nassets in a reach for higher yield. As a result, asset prices may have become distorted relative to\nthe economic fundamentals. The very slow pace of our balance sheet normalization may still be\ncontributing to a buildup of various financial imbalances. While until recently, financial markets\nremained remarkably stable, it is not uncommon to see volatility rise when asset prices become\ninflated and investors struggle to find a new equilibrium.\nWhat then should the stance of monetary policy be at this stage in the business cycle?\nMonetary policy can be a useful tool to lean against the ups and downs of the business cycle, but\nit is not well suited to address structural problems in the economy such as job polarization. When\neconomic conditions reflect the combination of full employment, price stability and trend\neconomic growth—as they more or less do now—monetary policy should be a neutral influence\non the economy. But the current setting of our target interest rate is still well below neutral. It\n\n8\n\n\fis, therefore, important that the FOMC continue on its current path of policy normalization with\ngradual increases in the target federal funds rate.\n\nConclusion\nIn closing, the good news is that the U.S. economy is currently growing at a moderate\npace, with full employment and price stability. As always, some regions and industries are doing\nbetter than others but, on the whole, economic conditions are good. At the same time, monetary\npolicy remains accommodative. To sustain the expansion without pushing the economy beyond\nits capacity limits and creating inflationary pressures, it will be important for the Federal Reserve\nto continue its gradual normalization of interest rates. Given the current momentum in the\neconomy, the FOMC will need to carefully calibrate its policy to lean against a potential buildup\nof inflationary pressure or financial market imbalances.\n\n9\n\n\f"

            "content": "Monetary Policy for the Near and Long Term\n\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFebruary 8, 2018\nWichita Independent Business Association Annual Meeting\nWichita, Kan.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you. I appreciate the opportunity to join you here this evening.\nThe Tenth Federal Reserve District covers a very large geography and keeping tabs on\neconomic conditions in the region is an important aspect of my work. Fortunately, I have a small\ngroup of economists at the Bank who conduct research, analyze data and survey key sectors of\nthe economy, but I also rely on individuals across the region who serve on our various boards\nand advisory groups. The input and perspective of these individuals and other contacts are key\nto our understanding of the economic conditions and emerging risks facing our region and the\nnation. Their contributions help to shape my views as I represent my region at the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC). In fact, there are a number of individuals from the Wichita area\nwho assist the Federal Reserve in this way, and I would like to take a moment to acknowledge\nthem.\nTrish Minard with Southwest National Bank here in Wichita, Kan., recently joined the\nKansas City Fed’s Board of Directors. Although the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in\nWashington, D.C., has oversight responsibilities for the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, each\nBank also operates under the leadership of a Board of Directors. This structure was designed by\nCongress to carefully balance public and private interests in the oversight of the nation’s central\nbank. The goal was to ensure broad representation in the Fed’s important policy deliberations\nwith ample opportunity for discussion and disagreement, while also providing insulation from\nthose who might seek to influence policy decisions for short-term political gain. As a result, the\nindividuals who serve on our board have a very important responsibility within the Fed’s\nstructure.\n\n2\n\n\fDan Solomon, chief financial officer of Koch Chemical Technology Group, has been\ninvolved with our Economic Advisory Council for several years, and I have appreciated his\ninsights on regional, national and global economic trends.\nI’d also like to recognize Michael DeBroeck, senior vice president with Intrust Bank, and\nBob Thurman, chief executive officer of Credit Union of America, who have served on our\nPayments Advisory Group. Additionally, Steve Radley, president of NetWork Kansas in\nAndover, serves as a member of our Community Development Advisory Council – a group that\nregularly informs and advises us on conditions in low-, and moderate-income communities. My\nthanks to each of these individuals for their service to the Kansas City Fed and for the\ncontributions they make to monetary policy deliberations.\nWe have a lot going at the Fed right now. At last week’s FOMC meeting, we said our\nfarewells to Janet Yellen, whose term as Fed chair has ended. And on Monday of this week, Jay\nPowell took the oath of office as the Fed’s new chairman. He is an experienced Fed governor\nwhose service on the Board of Governors began in 2012. Having worked with him the past\nseveral years, I think you can expect that Fed policy will continue along its current path, and I\nexpect a smooth transition.\nOf course, this week’s headlines have been focused on the market’s reaction to last\nFriday’s employment report and potential inflation risks. So, this evening, I’ll share with you my\nviews on the outlook for the nation’s economy and the challenges ahead for the Federal Open\nMarket Committee over the near- and longer-term. I’ll plan to leave time at the end of my\nremarks to take your questions, comments or advice.\n\n3\n\n\fBefore continuing, now would be a good time to remind you that the views I express this\nevening are my own and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\nThe fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound. Preliminary estimates suggest that real\nGDP — our broadest measure of economic activity — grew at an annual rate of just under 3\npercent in the second half of last year with robust consumer activity and a solid increase in\nbusiness spending on fixed investment.\nThis current expansion has been a long one and it has drawn millions of Americans into\nthe workforce as labor markets have strengthened. The unemployment rate has fallen to a\nhistorically low 4.1 percent. Here in Wichita, labor market conditions are somewhat tighter with\nthe unemployment rate at 3.8 percent.\nHiring remains solid with payroll employment gains averaging 192,000 per month over\nthe last three months. But the pace of payroll gains has been gradually slowing since the peak in\n2014, and I expect those numbers will decelerate further as labor markets continue to tighten and\nfirms find filling job openings increasingly difficult.\nAs labor markets have tightened, compensation for workers has increased. This is a\nwelcome development because wage growth has been fairly modest through much of the current\nexpansion.\nAnother favorable aspect of the current expansion is that inflation has remained low even\nas the economy has experienced above-trend growth and a tightening job market. This has\nhelped workers by allowing wage increases to outpace inflation. Year-over-year inflation is\n\n4\n\n\fcurrently running just under the Federal Reserve’s objective of 2 percent, although I expect it\nwill begin to rise as labor markets tighten further and global demand pushes up import prices.\nTaken together, these current conditions and the near-term outlook appear quite rosy.\nYou might think in a scenario like this, Federal Reserve policymakers would have an opportunity\nto relax a bit. Unfortunately, that is not the case.\n\nNear-term challenges\nAlthough the financial crisis is now well behind us, and we have largely achieved our\nobjectives for employment and inflation, the stance of monetary policy remains quite\naccommodative. The federal funds rate, which is the overnight interest rate we target, remains\nwell below estimates of its longer-run value of around 3 percent.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet remains extraordinarily large by\nhistorical standards due to the FOMC’s large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury and\nagency debt beginning in 2007. These programs, commonly referred to as quantitative easing or\nQE, ended in October 2014 and the process of shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet to reduce these\nholdings started last fall. By the end of this year, only about a quarter of the increase to the Fed’s\nbalance sheet resulting from the first round of large scale asset purchases will be unwound.\nAs monetary policy accommodation is gradually withdrawn, the economy is getting a\nboost from fiscal policy related to the recent tax bill. How much of a boost is hard to tell at this\nstage.\nIn our surveys of manufacturers across our District, the expectations of future activity\nhave increased since the bill was signed. This is potentially good news for Wichita, where the\neconomy is heavily reliant on manufacturing, a sector that experienced a net job loss last year.\n\n5\n\n\fOverall, I expect that lower personal tax rates will boost aggregate demand, and that a lower\ncorporate tax rate and the more favorable tax treatment of investment spending will increase\naggregate supply, although it is difficult to predict exactly how and when consumers and\nbusinesses will respond.\nThe result is that an uncertain degree of fiscal stimulus is arriving at the same time the\neconomy is operating at or beyond full employment and monetary policy remains\naccommodative. And because of that, it is important that the FOMC continues on its current\npath of policy normalization with gradual increases in the target federal funds rate. The median\nprojection from the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections calls for about three, 25 basis\npoint hikes in the federal funds rate this year and about the same number next year. This is a\nreasonable baseline unless the outlook changes materially.\n\nLonger-run challenges\nWhile threading this policy needle will be a key challenge over the next couple of years,\nthere are also a number of structural developments that could pose challenges over the longer\nrun. The nature of these structural issues is beyond the scope of monetary policy to address, but\nthey will nevertheless have implications for economic growth, employment and inflation and\ndeserve careful monitoring.\nAmong these is the slowdown that we have seen over the last several years in the\neconomy’s potential growth rate. This is the rate of growth consistent with maintaining the Fed’s\ndual mandate of price stability and full employment. By most estimates, this rate was falling\nbefore the financial crisis and is currently believed to be about one-half of what it was in the\n1990s. This slowdown in the economy’s potential growth stems from slower growth in the size\n\n6\n\n\fof the potential workforce and the productivity of that workforce. Due largely to demographic\nchanges, especially the retiring of the Baby Boom generation, the annual growth rate of our labor\nforce is only a little better than one-third of what it was in the 1990s. At the same time,\nproductivity growth is about one-half what it was in the 1990s. Both of these unfavorable trends\nare projected to persist over the next decade. While these projections are highly uncertain, if they\nprove accurate, we can expect, among other things, a slower rate of improvement in living\nstandards relative to the pre-crisis period.\nSlower potential growth also has some troubling implications from a monetary policy\nperspective. For one thing, it has led many economists to lower their estimate of the interest rate\nthat is consistent with full employment and price stability. Currently, the FOMC’s median\nprojection for the longer-run federal funds rate is around 3 percent, which is considerably below\nwhat it was only a few years ago. This means that a future FOMC may have substantially less\nroom to lower the federal funds rate should conditions warrant an increase in monetary stimulus.\nIn such situations, for example a future recession, it might prove helpful for fiscal policy to step\nin and provide a countercyclical stimulus.\nBut that leads me to another structural challenge—the unsustainable trend of government\ndebt. This will make it difficult for fiscal policy to play that countercyclical role.\nThe federal budget deficit increased as a share of GDP for the third straight year in fiscal\n2017, and it was widely expected to creep higher over time even before the recent tax cuts.\nDemographic trends will raise government spending as an increasing share of the population\nreceives retirement and health care benefits. Additionally, health care costs are projected to\ngrow faster than the economy, as are the federal government’s net interest costs.\n\n7\n\n\fIn all, federal debt held by the public, which was equal to about 35 percent of GDP\nbefore the recession, is now up to 75 percent of GDP. It is projected to exceed its historical\n(WWII) peak of 106 percent by the 2030s, barring a shift in fiscal policy. The nation remains far\nfrom a fiscal crisis, but changes will be necessary to put government debt on a sustainable\ntrajectory in the coming decades. The sooner these changes can be made, the less drastic they\nwill need to be and the better positioned fiscal policy will be to take a more prominent countercyclical role in any future downturn.\n\nConclusion\nIn closing, over the longer run, demographic trends and sluggish productivity point to the\npossibility of slower economic growth and higher fiscal deficits. These structural developments\nhave the potential to complicate monetary policy. If the neutral rate of interest remains\nhistorically low, monetary policy may have less scope to stimulate the economy in a downturn\nwithout again resorting to unconventional policies such as asset purchases. A natural response to\nsuch a situation would be to rely more heavily on fiscal policy. However, the longer-run fiscal\noutlook suggests that fiscal policy may be similarly constrained. Thus, it is critical that the\nlonger-run budget issues associated with our aging population be addressed sooner rather than\nlater.\nIn the near term, the good news is that the U.S. economy is currently growing at a\nmoderate pace, with full employment and price stability. As always, some regions and industries\nare doing better than others but, on the whole, economic conditions are good. At the same time,\nmonetary policy remains accommodative. To sustain the expansion without pushing the\n\n8\n\n\feconomy beyond its capacity limits and creating inflationary pressures, it will be important for\nthe Federal Reserve to continue its gradual normalization of interest rates.\n\n9\n\n\f"

            "content": "Statement of FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig\non the Senate Banking Committee passage\nof S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act\nDecember 5, 2017\nI am pleased that the Senate Banking Committee has advanced the regulatory relief debate with approval of S.\n2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The underlying goal of the\nlegislation is one I have long advocated: easing the burden for the banks that pose less risk and cost to the\nfinancial safety net and ultimately to the taxpayer while enabling stronger economic growth.\nTo that end, S. 2155 incorporates for banks with less than $10 billion in total assets several relief provisions I\nsupport, including a simpler leverage ratio of tangible equity to assets as the primary measure of capital\nadequacy. Other relief for small banks includes minimum standards for residential mortgage loans, appraisal\nrelief in rural areas, simplifying call reports, and extending the examination cycle. These are significant\nimprovements in the regulatory cost and landscape for these commercial banks.\nThe bill also raises the asset threshold for applying enhanced prudential standards to banks from $50 billion to\n$250 billion. In considering the matter of thresholds, Congress might require instead that regulatory mandates\nbe defined around bank activity rather than strictly asset size. Raising the asset threshold to $250 billion would\nhave the effect of immediately isolating a handful of non G-SIB regional banks and forcing them to abandon\ntheir commercial bank model with a focus on lending, toward the more leveraged universal bank model with its\nemphasis on trading, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. Further, this approach creates a\nsignificant barrier to growth for non G-SIB commercial banks in general, and especially for those approaching the\nthreshold limit. It also would encourage further consolidation among these commercial banks to achieve the\nscale needed to spread the costs of the enhanced prudential requirements. Consequently, the sum total of all\nof these effects would negatively impact competition and commercial credit availability to Main Street.\nRather than size thresholds, banks that are not G-SIBs and that have trading assets and trading liabilities of no\ngreater than 10 percent of total assets could be exempted from enhanced prudential standards if they hold\ntangible equity to assets of between 8 and 10 percent. Where necessary the banking agencies could act jointly\nto determine if any such bank poses systemic risk concerns. Currently, 93% of U.S. banks that are not G-SIBs (or\nan affiliate) have less than 10% of their assets in a trading account and also have an 8% tangible equity to assets\nratio.\nA look at the financial footprint of the largest bank holding companies in the United States illustrates why this\napproach merits serious consideration. As the chart below shows, the institutions with the largest footprints are\nsignificantly engaged in activities such as custody and safekeeping and/or have significant trading and derivative\nliability exposure, including a significant amount of sold protection through credit default swaps. The chart\nshows the sharp cliff effect separating the remaining institutions with dramatically smaller financial\nfootprints. These institutions -- commercial banks -- do not have significant exposure outside of their on balance\nsheet assets that are generally comprised of commercial and retail loans funded by deposits.\nThe bill also addresses elements of the Volcker Rule. It provides a blanket exemption from compliance with the\nVolcker Rule for banks with less than $10 billion of assets that also have less than 5% in total trading assets and\ntrading liabilities. There may be an alternative way to simplify the Volcker Rule and provide regulatory relief for\nbanks that are not prop traders without opening a loophole that would invite abuse of the safety net in the\nfuture. Congress could require the regulatory authorities to presume compliance and establish a safe harbor for\ncertain derivatives transactions, such as those that are entered into in conjunction with a loan or for hedge\naccounting purposes. Additionally, to address competitive inequities Congress could allow for non G-SIB\n\n\fcommercial banks, within defined capital limits, to own venture capital funds to help promote small business\nand local economies. Broadly if further changes are contemplated for the rule, it is imperative that the CEO\nattestation be preserved to assure that the largest banks maintain a reasonably designed compliance program\nfor the identification of any speculative activity.\nFinally, the provision that would exclude central bank reserves from the calculation of the supplemental\nleverage ratio for custodial banks poses costs to the public that should be taken into consideration as this\nlegislation is further debated. Custodial bank activities are highly commingled with the insured commercial bank\nactivities. While these activities might not pose major credit risk they do carry significant operational and other\nrisks, and make up a large portion of the financial footprint as depicted in the chart below. Such risk should be\nfunded with investor capital not a taxpayer backstop. The usefulness of a leverage ratio stems from the fact\nthat it does not discern among losses that flow from credits, operations, or any other risks regardless of whether\nthey are captured in the risk-weighted measure, and its integrity should not be compromised. Also, if the\noverall risk is less for these banks than other banks, their cost of capital should also be less and reflected in a\nlower return on equity.\n\n###\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and not necessarily those of the FDIC.\nThomas M.

            "content": "\"The Changing Financial Footprint and Its Effects on Competition and Banking\" - Remarks by\nFDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig delivered to the Western Independent Bankers\nDirectors Conference in San Francisco, CA\nNovember 17, 2017\nThe economics profession often cites Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations, written in 1776, as\nthe inception of modern economics. In it, he introduced the concept of the “invisible hand,”\nwhich held that the free interaction of individuals within a market system enables a nation to\nachieve its greatest wealth. This is a fundamental and profound tenet of capitalism and one\nthat I strongly support.\nAdam Smith, however, spoke about much more than the invisible hand. He knew the nature of\nthe players in the market and cautioned against market abuses, which he said were too often\naided by governments. He spoke of the dealers’ constant effort to narrow the market and\nrestrict competition, and he emphasized the inevitable negative effect these actions would\nhave on the public.1\nThe United States, from the free banking period of the 19th century to well into the 20th\ncentury, fostered a highly decentralized and mostly competitive banking and financial industry.\nDuring this period banks failed and individuals suffered losses, but, importantly, the economy\nrecovered and remained dynamic. Through this dynamism, the United States became the\nleading economy in the world. As recently as the 1980s there were more than 15,000 U.S.\nbanks, and there seemed to be at least one operating within nearly every market in the\ncountry. These banks served large and small businesses, as well as a broad cross section of the\npublic.\nIn recent decades, however, the U.S. banking industry has become increasingly concentrated,\nand the largest banks have become far more economically and politically powerful. Only time\nwill tell how this will play out, but the implications on broad economic growth and sustainability\nare sure to be profound. What is already clear is that Adam Smith’s admonition regarding the\nnarrowing of the market, made more than 200 years ago, has never been more relevant than it\nis today with regard to the U.S. banking industry.\nChart 1 shows the trend in bank asset concentration within the United States since 1984. The\nchart also contrasts this trend among different groups of banks: Global Systemically Important\nBanks (G-SIBs), non G-SIBs with more than $50 billion in assets, regional banks with $10 to $50\nbillion in assets, and smaller community banks with less than $10 billion in assets. Notably, at\nthe start of the period, the largest banks controlled 15 percent of total industry assets, while\n1\n\nAdam Smith, An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations, Book I, Chapter XI,\nMarch 9, 1776.\n\n\fregional and community banks controlled the remaining 85 percent. The industry was\ndecentralized, highly competitive, and as theory would have it, highly motivated to serve\nbusiness and consumers well.\nSince 1984, however, the distribution of assets has changed dramatically. Today, the eight U.S.\nG-SIBs control 50 percent of industry assets. In contrast, the largest 41 regional commercial\nbanks that are non G-SIBs and that have assets of more than $50 billion control only about 20\npercent of industry assets, while the remaining more than 5,700 U.S. commercial banks\ncombined hold less than 30 percent of total industry assets.\nChart 2 and Chart 3 contrast the financial footprint of the eight G-SIBs (including their trading,\nderivatives, trust assets and safe keeping arrangements) with all banks in the United States.\nThese charts show the full scope and financial dominance of a handful of banks that each\ncontrol assets that are multiples of U.S GDP. All but two of the universal banks at the top of\nChart 2 are G-SIBs. The top four each have individual footprints exceeding U.S. GDP of $18\ntrillion.\nSuch concentration of assets reflects a striking change in industry structure. The full effect on\nthe economy of this concentration of financial power and the continuing trend toward\nconsolidation is yet to be fully determined. However, it raises important questions regarding\nthe long-term implications.\nThe causes of the trend toward concentration are many. Some are natural changes in market\nconditions. Others reflect an uneven playing field, often facilitated by government actions,\nwhich raises the question of whether such actions should be questioned and modified. Among\nthe natural influences are technological advancements that reduce transaction costs and\nencourage scale of operations. Such advances naturally spur mergers. Technology also enables\nvast improvements in communications across greater distances and makes the management of\nsprawling operations less costly. While these factors are certainly among the forces driving\nconsolidation, they fail to explain all the changes that have occurred in the banking industry and\nthe dramatic increase in size and power of the largest firms today. Studies show, for example,\nthat economies of scale for banks run their course long before banks reach $100 billion of\nassets, far below the trillions of dollars of assets that the G-SIBs control.\nBeyond these more organic influences, therefore, I want to take the next few minutes to\noutline some of the specific government-related factors that contribute substantially to the\nconsolidation of banking and finance, and consider the consequences of these largest firms\nbecoming an ever-more powerful force within the economy. Such factors include, for example,\nthe subsidy of too-big-and-too-complex-to-fail that gives disproportionate funding and capital\nadvantages to the largest, most systemically important banks. They also include long periods of\nabnormally low interest rates, as well as anti-trust tools developed in an earlier period and for a\ndifferent market and market structure. Today, regional commercial banks even more so than\nsmaller community banks are in danger of disappearing as the advantages of size and\n\n\fcomplexity encourage consolidation, narrow competition, and may serve businesses and\nconsumers poorly.\nGovernment Subsidy and the Funding Advantage\nCapitalism works best when both exit and entry are permitted. However, given the banking\nindustry’s financial footprint today and its implication for stability, a presumption exists that\ncertain of the largest firms — G-SIBs — cannot be allowed to exit the economy through failure.\nThis presumption was aptly demonstrated during the 2008 crisis. It was abundantly clear that\nhad the market ruled, some of the largest banking firms would have failed. Most likely, other\nbanks would have filled the void over time, keeping the industry fresh and more efficient; but\nthe transition costs would have been enormous. Instead, the G-SIBs were kept in place and\nremain dominant.\nDespite provisions under the Dodd-Frank Act to assure an orderly resolution should a G-SIB\nbecome insolvent or experience a run on its liabilities, the financial footprints of the largest\nfirms are so expansive, as Chart 2 illustrates, it is unlikely governments could stand by and do\nnothing. At some point they would assure continuity of operations for the largest systemically\nimportant banking firms. The gross amount of assets under their corporate organization is\nmultiples of U.S. GDP and could not safely be made subject to the bankruptcy process. The\nmarket understands this and prices its effect accordingly.\nOne dimension of this pricing effect on the relative cost of capital of the G-SIBs compared to\nthe rest of the industry is illustrated in Table 1. The G-SIBs hold on average more than 200 basis\npoints less tangible capital. Their tangible equity-to-assets ratio is 6.6 percent. The largest\nregional banks hold on average 8.7 percent.\nAn analogy of this competitive advantage would be if the airline industry were subsidized in\nsuch a way that a handful of carriers received a 25 percent fuel subsidy, while the fuel cost\nsupports for all the other airlines was significantly smaller. Over time we can be confident\nwhich airlines would dominate that industry. In the banking industry, G-SIBs receive a\ngovernment-backed “fuel subsidy” in the form of a cost-of-capital advantage because the\nmarket perceives them as too-big-to-fail. That advantage overwhelms the benefits stemming\nfrom the financial safety net that their smaller, regional and less economically influential\ncommercial bank counterparts receive. Since the way to achieving this advantage is size and\ncomplexity, it encourages consolidation.\nLow Interest Rates\nFor most of the past three decades monetary policy has been accommodative or highly\naccommodative, with its policy rate systematically below the long-term growth rate of GDP, as\nshown in Chart 4. A case can be made that low nominal interest rates facilitate the\nconsolidation of industries. Borrowing to acquire a competitor is more likely to be successful\nwhen the cost of debt is low. Rather than invest in new capacity or means of production, it is\n\n\fbetter to borrow at low rates and acquire other firms, thus, achieving a dominant influence\nover product capacity and price.\nMarket Power and Anti-Trust\nAs recently as 1984, banking firms equivalent to today’s G-SIBs owned 14 banks and held less\nthan 10 percent of industry assets. Today’s G-SIBs own 20 banks and control 50 percent of\nindustry assets. These are notable increases in concentration and reflect a trend toward evergreater levels of resource concentration.\nWhile the structure of the industry has changed, methods to evaluate the effects of mergers\nand consolidations on competition remain rooted in a different time. Traditionally, bank\nmergers are judged on a local market basis and around control of demand deposits. Limited\nanalysis exists about the effects of consolidation on lending in local markets or the effects of\nresource concentration on market structure and pricing behavior more broadly. There also has\nbeen little analysis of the effects of too-big-to-fail on resource concentration, market power\nand industry competition, or its long-run effects on the U.S. market system. As a result, there\nhas been limited restraint on bank consolidations over the past two decades.2\nAvailable evidence suggests that this trend has consequences to the economy. Where larger\nbanks acquire smaller regional or community banks, loans to small business decline.3,4\nAlthough the results are not conclusive, research suggests that increased concentration in\ndeveloped economies is associated with slower growth rates in GDP.5\nThese effects may be as responsible as regulatory burden in influencing the availability of\ncredit. Theory tells us that as oligopolies and monopolies increase their influence, industry\ncapacity and competition generally decline while market prices and profits increase. If the\nmarket structure of banking in the United States is evolving toward that of an oligopoly, then\nconcentration is as important as regulatory burden in its effects on growth and its influence on\nthe availability of credit.\nMarket structure matters in the successful deployment of economic resources. We should be\nthoughtful in judging the evolution of the U.S. banking industry structure from that of a highly\n2\n\nThere are limits on total retail deposits held by a bank but new source of funds using repurchase\nagreements has moderated the effects these limits have on bank size or influence.\n3\nBerger, Allen N., Anthony Saunders, Joseph M. Saline, and Gregory F.

Under this rule\na broad base of banking firms must hold certain levels of long-term debt that is meant to\nabsorb losses should a bank fail. Its intention is laudable: to improve the resolvability of\nbanking firms and to assure that, should they fail, they can be resolved without turning to the\ntaxpayer for help. To meet this goal, however, some regional and less leveraged large banks\nmust add debt to their balance sheets.\nRegardless of its purpose, the effect of TLAC, in some instances, is to force banks into a\ndifferent business model, away from core commercial banking portfolios and toward greater\nreliance on trading activities for income. This may have the further effect of encouraging\nacquisitions to build needed capacity and scale to manage and service the increased leverage.\nThe very banks we want to see continue in the business of making loans are being forced to\nchange their business model from commercial banking to universal banking, which on balance\nmay not facilitate economic growth.\nRegulatory Reform and the Financial Footprint\nThe diversity of business models in the U.S. banking industry has served the U.S. economy well.\nThe unique attributes of different financial firms are not tied to their size but to their varying\nfinancial activities. Therefore I have long advocated that regulatory oversight of the industry\nshould center on activities, not asset size.\nFundamentally, two groups of banks operate in the United States: commercial banks and\nuniversal banks. Universal banks engage in commercial banking as well as a significant amount\nof trading through their investment banking, broker-dealer, fiduciary and global custody\noperations. Commercial banks, even the largest among them, generally confine their activities\nto the commercial banking business model and have dramatically smaller financial footprints.\nAlso, consider the significant difference in the amount of trading between U.S. G-SIBs – or\nuniversal banks – and the largest commercial banks. G-SIBs have trading activities measuring\n20.7 percent on average, while trading activities comprise only 1.3 percent of assets on average\nof the largest regional commercial banks. The large non-G-SIB regional commercial banks that\ndo trade or have derivatives mainly do so to accommodate their existing loan customers or\nhedge their own risks, while the G-SIBs with their universal bank models are typically global\nmarket makers dealing in a cadre of financial contracts, many that are complex and opaque.\n\n\fSome of these G-SIBs on a standalone basis have trading activities equal to 40 percent or more\nof total assets.\nMany of the Dodd-Frank regulations and enhanced prudential standards were rightly\nestablished to constrain the impact of universal banking on the public safety net and to address\nthe too-big-and-too-complex-to-fail concerns that the U.S. G-SIBs pose. However, because the\nremainder of the industry — with its simpler commercial bank business model — holds less\nthan 10 percent of its assets in trading activities and maintains higher levels of tangible capital\nof approximately 8 percent, it is less of a systemic threat. The differences between universal\nand commercial banks are real and should not be ignored when calibrating an appropriate\nregulatory regime. They call for an approach that focuses on the business model, not size,\nthereby eliminating the need to rely on arbitrary asset size thresholds that become obsolete\nalmost from the time they are established.\nAnalysis of the industry’s financial footprint suggests that regulatory relief should be extended\nto community and regional banks that are principally engaged in traditional commercial\nbanking activities while universal banks should remain subject to enhanced prudential\nstandards. The data show this can be done effectively by using criteria that measures a bank’s\nengagement in activities outside the commercial bank business model; for example, the degree\nto which a bank engages in trading, its designation as a G-SIB, and the level of tangible equity it\nrelies on to fund its balance sheet. As a backstop the primary regulator could also have\nauthority to designate a firm as a universal bank in the case it has expanded into noncommercial bank activities to such a degree that there is a need to address systemic risk\nconcerns.\nTo be sure, the U.S. banking industry needs more than regulatory relief if it is to regain its\nvigor. Unless the trajectory for consolidation and concentration in the banking system is\ndiverted, the implications for the broader economy are profound. As Adam Smith advised long\nago, market structure matters. We must be mindful of seemingly unconnected factors that\ncombine to influence the evolution of the U.S. banking structure from a highly competitive,\ndecentralized system to a concentrated one where dynamism is lost to influence peddling and\ndistortive government intervention.\n###\n\n\f\f\fThomas M.

            "content": "“Deposit Insurance: Addressing Its Moral Hazard Effect”\nRemarks by Thomas M. Hoenig,\nVice Chairman of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and\nPresident of the International Association of Deposit Insurers\nPresented to the\n16th Annual IADI General Meeting and Annual Conference\nQuebec City, Canada\nOctober 11, 2017\n\nIntroduction\nIn the more than 40 years that I have worked in bank regulation and supervision at the FDIC and the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, as well as in monetary policy on the Federal Open Markets\nCommittee, I have had the opportunity to observe firsthand the sense of security that deposit insurance\ngives bank customers and creditors, with the objective of providing increased financial stability.\nUnfortunately, I also have observed that deposit insurance, like any insurance system, inherently invites\nits own abuse—moral hazard—that can cause unintended serious destabilizing effects on an economic\nsystem.\nWhile this experience does not provide me with the ability to outline a fail-safe solution to remedy this\nconflict, it does offer me some insight on the matter that I want to share with you, my colleagues, here\ntoday. Deposit insurance serves a most useful purpose, and I am not implying that its use be\ndiscontinued because of the moral hazard side effects. I am suggesting, however, that we can mitigate\nthose effects if we, as insurers and supervisors, insist on good oversight through sound bank\nsupervision, reliable capital standards, and insurance pricing that holds banks accountable for the risk\nprofile they choose.\nMoral Hazard\nThe principle function of deposit insurance is to promote confidence in the banking system and thus\nfinancial stability. With such guarantees, depositors and creditors have no reason to run—not when\nproblems occur at banks other than where they place their money, nor when they suspect their own\nbank might fail. However, such guarantees and the associated loss of market discipline, as a check\nagainst institutional excess, invite systematic excessive risk-taking: the moral hazard effect.\nWhile preventing runs on solvent institutions is desirable, preventing runs at any cost on all institutions,\neven those that are insolvent, is not. The threat of failure serves to ensure that banks remain more\nsensitive to risk, and it inhibits the industry from trending toward excessive risks. Without the discipline\nprovided by depositors and other creditors inclined to withdraw their funds when they suspect a bank of\nbeing unsafe, banks have an incentive to take on such exposures. As this occurs, particularly in the\nlargest banks, the risk is often borne by the public, which backstops the financial safety nets.\n\n\fIn the United States, for example, the risks are borne by the healthy banks that fund the deposit\ninsurance system; by their customers who pay the costs through higher loan rates and lower deposit\nrates; and ultimately by taxpayers, as we learned during the most recent financial crisis.\nSince deposit insurance and government guarantees dramatically decrease the incentive of insured\ndepositors to monitor and discipline banks, the responsibility of preventing banks from imposing the\ncosts of excessive risk taking on the public safety net falls to other mechanisms, namely bank\nsupervisors and capital. Advocacy and support of both are important functions of the deposit insurer.\nCounterbalances\nWith this in mind, I will focus most of the remainder of my comments on the role of bank supervision\nand capital in counterbalancing the moral hazard dilemma. Historically, these tools, when used\neffectively, have proved invaluable in assuring the banking sector is deserving of the public’s confidence.\nIn good times, however, they are often strongly opposed by the industry and, worse yet, they\nsometimes go unused by both supervisors and insurers.\nPaul Warburg, a German-born New York banker during the Great Depression and an early advocate for\nthe Federal Reserve System, observed this phenomenon as he commented on the public’s attitude\nleading up to the Great Depression:\nIn a country whose idol is prosperity, any attempt to tamper with conditions in which easy profits\nare made and people are happy, is strongly resented. It is a desperately unpopular undertaking\nto dare to sound a discordant note of warning in an atmosphere of cheer, even though one\nmight be able to forecast with certainty that the ice, on which the mad dance was going, was\nbound to break. Even if one succeeded in driving the frolicking crowd ashore before the ice\ncracked, there would have been protests that the cover was strong enough and no disaster\nwould have occurred if only the situation had been left alone.1\nSuch attitudes can be as prevalent today as they were before the Great Depression. As they develop and\nas the crowd noise drowns out calls for prudence, supervisors and insurers must force the crowd from\nthe proverbial ice. To fail in this duty, supervisors and insurers cannot hope to protect their insurance\nfund from loss or to protect the economy and the public from the inevitable correction and its resulting\neconomic suffering. It is exhausting work, and it is most difficult to accomplish in the boom period just\nbefore a crisis.\nHaving described the demands of the challenge, I am also confident that it can be managed. It requires a\ncommitment of bank owners in the form of equity capital. And it requires bank supervisors and insurers\nto apply sound supervisory principles, anchored by the rule of law, irrespective of the enthusiasm and\nthe politics of the moment.\n\n1\n\nPaul M. Warburg, The Federal Reserve System, Vol I, Addendum II, “The Stock Exchange Crisis of\n1929,” The Macmillan Company, 1930.\n\n\fSupervision\nGood supervision involves setting standards, collecting and analyzing information, and ultimately\napplying judgment and demonstrating courage in conveying that information to financial firms and\nother market participants.\nUltimately, however, the keystone on which the successful application of these principles rests is the\nwillingness of supervisors and deposit insurers to do their job. It requires having healthy skepticism and\nasking tough questions. It requires the independence and courage to convey adverse findings to bank\nmanagement and, when appropriate, to the public. And it requires doing all of this even, and especially,\nin an environment of growth, when it is often easier to accept the prevailing view. Supported by facts\nand experience, it is the supervisors’ and deposit insurers’ responsibility to stand against the madness of\ncrowds.\nIn 2006 and 2007 in the United States, there were clear signs that problems were surfacing, and yet\nsupervisors were slow to act. Even when guidance was issued about commercial real estate, the U.S.\nregulatory agencies quickly backed down after the industry raised objections. In hindsight, the\nregulators were correct in their projections, and the mistake was in backing down.\nMore serious perhaps was that the regulatory agencies appeared to have actually joined the siren song\nof “this time it’s different,” judging from the absence of any supervisory actions against some of the\nworld’s largest and most complex firms and the decision to cut back on systematic examinations in the\nyears leading up to 2008. All the exam findings in the world and all the model warning signals are of little\nuse if leaders of the regulatory bodies fail to carry the message forward.\nSupervisors can make a difference, but doing so requires knowledge, analytical and communications\nskills, and guts.\nOwner Equity Capital\nThe purpose of bank supervision is to verify that banks are operating soundly and to assure that\noperational or portfolio weaknesses are addressed. However, supervision should not attempt to\neliminate all business risk. It should not attempt to shield firms from the consequences of individual\nwrong business decisions. That is the role of ownership capital. To be useful, the measure of capital\nshould be simple, understandable, and enforceable.\nUnfortunately, capital adequacy today is judged by a number of highly complex and opaque risk-based\nmeasures. One such measure, using internal models, shows tier 1 capital ratios of 14.38 as a percent of\nrisk-weighted assets for U.S. G-SIBs. But then you learn that risk-weighted assets represent only 40\npercent of total assets at these firms. No other industry is allowed to remove 60 percent of its assets\nfrom the balance sheet when its financial condition is assessed. This serves to mislead and give the\nperception of strength, especially when excessive risk is the order of the day.\nA more dependable measure of capital strength is the tangible leverage ratio. It requires that you take\ntangible equity capital and divide it by total assets. This measure, which market investors rely on most\nconsistently, shows that U.S. G-SIBs have a ratio of 6.6 percent, compared with a ratio of nearly 9\npercent for the other institutions in the U.S. banking industry. European G-SIBs have a tangible capital\nratio of 4.6 percent.\n\n\fTo appreciate the significance of these different percentages, compare them with the conservative\nestimates of U.S. bank losses during the 2008 crisis that show the industry lost approximately 7 percent\nof assets. At that time, tangible capital was about 3 percent. Mistakes will occur, but there is no excuse\nfor condoning capital measures that mislead and capital levels that are unable to absorb even modest\nlosses, and which in the end require the taxpayer to pick up the pieces of the financial industry.\nIt has been suggested that relying on the more strict leverage ratio as the principal measure of capital\nadequacy might cause lending and economic growth to slow. Some also argue that requiring higher\ncapital standards would cause bankers to take on greater risks to boost returns. However, research\nrelated to each of those topics suggests the assertions are not valid. The Bank of International\nSettlements found that a 1 percentage point increase in the equity-to total assets ratio is associated\nwith a 0.6 percentage point increase in annual loan growth.2 Other data3 show that the U.S. banks that\nentered the crisis in 2008 with higher capital levels had more modest declines in loans and recovered\nmore quickly through the cycle. Concurrently, the banks going into 2008 with the lowest capital levels,\nincluding the largest banks, experienced the most dramatic declines in lending and highest rates of\nfailure or bailout. The data are clear that strong capital allows for more flexibility in managing through\nthe business cycle. Finally, data show that banks with higher equity capital have higher price-to-book\nvalues4, demonstrating that competing from financial strength pays off.\nFrom a supervision program perspective, moving away from risk-based capital measures toward an\nassessment of adequacy based on tangible equity would generate more reliable information from which\nto make supervisory judgments and would free up billions of dollars from supervision budgets currently\nspent computing and analyzing risk-based measures that are too-often gamed.\nRather than regulators assigning weights broadly across the industry, risk-based capital is better used by\nmanagement to allocate capital on an internal basis with that process being subject to examination.\nFurther, risk-based capital and models can be useful components of the supervision process for stress\ntesting different economic scenarios, but the extension of their use as the principle forward measure of\nadequacy too often misinforms the investment community and the broader public. History also shows,\nespecially in the recent financial crisis, that the leverage ratio, not risk-based capital, has always been a\nmore useful measure and predictor of solvency for regulators and the public.\nAdequate capital as measured using a leverage ratio, in combination with strong bank examinations and\nsupervision practices, is the best means to ensure sound banks, a safely funded insurance system, and a\nstrong economy.\n\n2\n\nGambacorta, Leonardo; Shin, Hyun Song; BIS Working Papers No. 558: Why Bank Capital Matters for\nMonetary Policy, April 2016, https://www.bis.org/publ/work558.pdf\n3\n\nLending Through The Cycle: https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/lending-through-thecycle.pdf\n4\n\nGlobal Capital Index: https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/capitalizationratio2q2017.pdf\n\n\fDeposit Insurance Pricing\nThe final tool I will mention for counterbalancing moral hazard involves the pricing of deposit insurance,\nspecifically, the use of risk-based premiums against currently held assts. A well-designed risk-based\npremium system can help to mitigate moral hazard by making it more costly for insured institutions to\nundertake risky activities or practices. If institutions are faced with higher premiums for taking actions\nthat expose the deposit insurance fund to greater risk, this can serve as a deterrent to excessive risk\ntaking. Higher premiums for actions that expose the DIF to greater risk can serve as a deterrent to\ninstitutions that engage in excessive risk taking.\nDesigning and implementing an effective risk-based premium system is not easy. It requires a great deal\nof data and sophisticated analytics to get it right. Even then, political realities make it difficult to charge\nadequately for the full risk exposure that well-connected, but high risk, institutions may pose to the\ninsurance fund. For these reasons, it is important to keep in mind that risk-based pricing of deposit\ninsurance should not be viewed as a substitute for strong supervision and capital standards, but rather\nas a potentially useful complement under those circumstances that allow for the development of a\nrobust premium system tied to risk.\nConclusion\nI will close by referring you to a book that is available at the back of the room entitled Integrity, Fairness\nand Resolve. It is a biography of an American bank examiner, Bill Taylor, who was the head of the\nFederal Reserve’s Division of Bank Supervision and then was chairman of the FDIC. Bill taught that good\nsupervision requires information gathering and validation, experience, leadership, and true courage. As\ninsurers of the banking industries in each of our countries who must deal with and control for the risk\nthat our insurance protects against, we require those same traits and, thus, I recommend the book to\nyou as a lesson in leadership and courage.\n###\nThe views expressed are those of the speaker and not necessarily those of the FDIC.\nThomas M.

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 11, 2017\nKansas City, Mo.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF NOON, CT/1 PM ET\n\nThank you. It’s always a pleasure to join you at the Central Exchange.\nThe U.S. economy has now entered its ninth year of expansion, and labor markets have\nnormalized. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth has averaged 2.1 percent over the last\nseven years, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to 4.2 percent today.\nOverall, the economy looks to be in good shape.\nDespite this positive news, there has been a great deal of attention focused on inflation.\nNot because the inflation rate is high like it was in the early 1980s, but rather because it is low.\nBased on the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation—the Personal Consumption\nExpenditures (PCE) price index—the current inflation rate is running just under 1.5 percent. Of\ncourse, this is an aggregate measure of inflation. If a specific component of the consumption\nbasket is taking a greater bite out of your paycheck, such as the rental cost of housing, you might\nfeel inflation is plenty high. On the other hand, you might find that the price of a big-screen\ntelevision is more affordable. Taken together, this preferred measure of inflation includes a\ncollection of hundreds of different individual prices, gets revised periodically, and doesn’t take\ninto account asset price inflation.\nNow you may be asking yourself “what’s wrong with low inflation?” It’s a fair question\nand one I plan to address in my remarks today. I’ll talk about why I believe that, in the context of\na growing economy at full employment, low inflation is not a current worry. I’ll also review\nsome of the factors that are contributing to soft inflation readings and talk about the implications\nfor monetary policy.\nBefore continuing, I must tell you that any views I share are wholly my own.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF NOON, CT/1 PM ET\n\nWhy the FOMC targets 2 percent inflation\nAs background, let me explain why inflation plays a prominent role in the Fed’s policy\ndecisions. You may know that Congress has given the Federal Reserve a mandate that is spelled\nout in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977, and it specifies that the Federal Reserve\n“promote … maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” This\nmandate is often referred to as a “dual mandate” because moderate long-term interest rates are\nthe expected result of achieving the goals of maximum employment and stable prices.\nHistorically, the price stability mandate was viewed largely in qualitative terms. For\nexample, former Fed Chairs Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan defined price stability as a state in\nwhich expectations of inflation are not a pervasive influence on economic and financial behavior.\nOver time, however, as major central banks around the world—including, first, the Reserve Bank\nof New Zealand, then the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank\n—adopted inflation targets, the Federal Reserve began considering a numerical inflation\nobjective for the United States. Seeing how inflation targets in other countries were viewed to\nhave helped successfully bring inflation down from undesirably high levels and stabilize it near\ntarget, many academics and policymakers advocated a numerical inflation objective for the\nFederal Reserve. This was despite inflation having already stabilized at moderate rates in the\nUnited States in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.\nAfter several years of debating the merits of an explicit numerical inflation objective, the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted a 2 percent inflation objective in January\n2012.1 In its “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” the FOMC stated\n\n1\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC19960703meeting.pdf,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20050202meeting.pdf,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20070321meeting.pdf,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20101015confcall.pdf,\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF NOON, CT/1 PM ET\n\nthat “inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal\nReserve’s statutory mandate.”2\nThe Committee chose 2 percent as its objective based on a number of factors. One factor\nwas a consideration of the costs of inflation. When inflation is much above 2 percent, relative\nprice signals get distorted, uncertainty about the future price level increases, and income is\narbitrarily transferred from creditors and savers to borrowers. On the other hand, some argue that\ninflation much below 2 percent also could be costly. For example, when inflation is low, nominal\ninterest rates tend to be low. As a result, there is less room to cut rates in an economic downturn\nand policymakers could be faced with resorting to unconventional policy instruments when\ninterest rates are at zero, as occurred in 2008.\nAt the time the target was adopted in 2012, inflation in the United States appeared to be\nanchored near 2 percent, and many other central banks had adopted 2 percent as either the center\nof a target range for inflation or as a specific target. In addition, monetary policy was highly\naccommodative in 2012, with the policy interest rate near zero and the Fed’s balance sheet large\nby historical standards, and growing. This highly accommodative stance of policy caused some\nconcern that inflation expectations could become unanchored and move higher.\nWhile I supported the 2012 decision to specify a 2 percent objective for inflation, in\nhindsight I think it has proven to be far more challenging than expected both as a\ncommunications mechanism and a policy guide. Too much focus is placed on achieving this\nspecific numerical target when, in fact, inflation is likely to fluctuate around that target with\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20110126meeting.pdf, and\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20111213meeting.pdf.\n2\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF NOON, CT/1 PM ET\n\ndeviations that occasionally might persist. In fact, the qualitative definition of price stability that\nguided Volcker and Greenspan rings true today: An inflation rate that does not materially affect\nthe decisions of business or households is an inflation rate that is consistent with price stability.\nWhile I still see 2 percent as an appropriate long-run objective for policy, I think it makes sense\nto evaluate deviations from that objective in a broader context.\n\nThe mandate is not as simple as a number\nClearly, the current inflation rate is running below 2 percent and has been for several\nyears. But let’s put that in the context of the other leg of our dual mandate—maximum\nemployment. The unemployment rate is currently 4.2 percent, below most estimates of the fullemployment unemployment rate, including that of the Congressional Budget Office (4.75\npercent), the Survey of Professional Forecasters (4.5 percent), and the FOMC participants’\nmedian projection for the longer-run unemployment rate of 4.6 percent.\nIn addition, FOMC participants project real GDP to grow faster over the next two years\nthan its longer-run growth rate of 1.8 percent, pushing the unemployment rate down further.\nThese projections suggest that the recent, and persistent, softness of inflation relative to 2 percent\nhas not prevented the economy from achieving and, arguably, overshooting maximum\nemployment. Indeed, as recently as last year, the PCE inflation rate less food and energy prices\ncame in at 1.9 percent on a Q4 over Q4 basis. It’s only been since February that we have seen a\nweakening in this measure of core inflation.\nTaking the recent performance of the labor market and inflation together, I would argue\nthat the FOMC is, by historical standards, meeting the dual mandate. Yet our policy interest rate\nremains below FOMC participants’ estimate of its longer-run level. Specifically, FOMC\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF NOON, CT/1 PM ET\n\nparticipants have lifted the federal funds rate—our target policy rate—four times beginning in\nDecember 2015, with the latest move in June. With these moves, the federal funds rate now\nstands at 1 to 1¼ percent compared to the FOMC’s median projection of the longer-run funds\nrate of 2.8 percent.\n\nSoft inflation is not an indicator of cyclical weakness\nSo what is driving this slowdown in inflation? It does not appear that the slowdown is\nassociated with a weakening economy. As I mentioned earlier, the current unemployment rate is\nlower than many estimates of the full-employment rate, and the economy has been growing\nfaster than estimates of its longer-run trend growth rate. These conditions might normally be\nassociated with rising inflation. That inflation has instead been falling does not, however, appear\nto reflect slack in labor markets.\nReadings from the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators (LMCI)\nsupport this view.3 The LMCI looks at 24 different labor market variables and constructs two\nmeasures to describe labor market conditions: the level of activity and momentum. The level of\nactivity continues the improvement we’ve seen throughout this expansion and, except for May\nand July, it’s at its highest level since the end of the recession and is about equal to its level at the\nend of the last expansion, suggesting tight labor market conditions. The other measure, focused\non the momentum in the labor market, has remained at a high level, suggesting strength over the\nnear-term. Among the key variables driving improvement in the level of activity over the last six\nmonths were an increase in the quits rate and a decrease in the number of people working part\ntime for economic reasons as a share of household employment. In other words, more people left\n\n3\n\nSee https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/research/indicatorsdata/lmci/2017/lmci_091317.pdf.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF NOON, CT/1 PM ET\n\ntheir jobs for other employment and fewer people were working part-time because they couldn’t\nfind full-time jobs. These are favorable signs, but history reminds us that they are unlikely to be\nsustainable in the longer-run.\nLabor markets also show limited slack based on behavior of the labor force participation\nrate. Demographic trends, particularly the aging and retirement of the large baby boom\ngeneration, have been exerting downward pressure on participation in the labor force for some\ntime. However, over the last four years, the labor force participation rate has stabilized, after five\nyears of unprecedented sharp declines that started in the last recession. The steady participation\nrate in recent years therefore signals that improving labor market conditions have drawn workers\nfrom the sidelines and more people are remaining in the workforce. Again, this is not a\ndevelopment that can continue unabated. As the demographic trend reasserts itself, the labor\nforce participation rate will fall, tightening labor market conditions further.\nAdditional evidence is based on research by economists at the San Francisco Fed who\nlooked at unemployment over the past 100 years.4 They estimate a hypothetical unemployment\nrate that is consistent with stable inflation and aggregate production being at its long-run level,\nbased on the relationship between inflation and labor market slack. Going back to 1890, they\nfind that this stable-inflation unemployment rate fluctuates in a relatively narrow range of 4½ to\n5½ percent. With today’s unemployment rate of 4.2 percent, we are below the low end of this\nrange.\nIf weakness in the economy is not a cause of soft inflation, then what is? My best guess\nis that it is a combination of idiosyncratic shocks combined with a number of longer-run changes\nthat are holding down inflation. Examples of idiosyncratic shocks are large declines in the prices\n\n4\n\nRegis Barnichon and Christian Matthes, “The Natural Rate of Unemployment over the Past 100 Years,” Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Letter, August 14, 2017.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF NOON, CT/1 PM ET\n\nof telecommunications services associated with the introduction of unlimited data plans and onetime downward movements in pharmaceutical prices as various drugs come off patent. Among\nthe longer-run forces holding inflation down are the lingering effects of the appreciation of the\ndollar and decline in oil prices from 2014. While these forces should now be abating, several\nstructural factors—such as global competition, an aging population, technological change and\ndisruptive forces in the retail sector—may persist. For example, Amazon’s purchase of Whole\nFoods and the expansion of Aldi and Lidl in the U.S. market are disrupting the grocery business\nand increasing competitive pressure.\nThese developments, along with the persistence of inflation below target, may also have\ncontributed to inflation expectations settling at a level somewhat less than 2 percent. If so,\nmonetary policy may be confronted with a difficult dilemma. Should policy normalization\nproceed on a gradual path to avoid overheating the economy? Or would it be more prudent to\nwait until inflation reaches 2 percent before taking further steps to tighten policy?\n\nPatience is not always a virtue\nRecent experience suggests inflation has not been very responsive to labor market slack.\nEven in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when unemployment reached 10 percent, the\ninflation rate excluding food and energy prices has fluctuated in a relatively narrow range\n(roughly 1 percent to 2 percent). In my view, because of the weakness of the relationship\nbetween inflation and slack, it would take a considerable overheating of the economy to move\ninflation more quickly up to 2 percent. Such overheating would, in the meantime, foster a\nmisallocation of resources and risk financial instability as asset prices continue to climb. In\naddition, there is a meaningful risk that if the unemployment rate fell significantly further,\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF NOON, CT/1 PM ET\n\ninflation might move considerably above 2 percent, causing policymakers to tighten policy\nabruptly. Monetary policy affects the economy with considerable lags such that, by the time we\nsee inflation actually moving up to 2 percent, it may be too late to prevent an undesirable\novershooting. This go-stop approach to monetary policy serves to foster uncertainty and too\noften ends in recession.\nI also recall another time when concern about low inflation led to a delay in interest rate\nnormalization. From 2002 to 2006 as the economy recovered only gradually from the 2001\neconomic recession, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate to 1 percent and held it there for a year.\nIn doing so, the FOMC was responding in part to a concern that inflation was falling below\ndesired levels, with an outside risk of actual deflation. During this period, the real time data on\nthe core PCE price index fell below 1 percent. And in May 2003, the FOMC pointed explicitly to\nthe risk of an “unwelcome substantial fall in inflation.”5\nIn retrospect, the inflation data was subsequently revised up, and by 2005 inflation had\nrisen above 2 percent. Arguably, and although not the root cause, the low level of interest rates in\nthis period fostered the financing of asset purchases with short-term borrowing, feeding a\nbuildup of financial imbalances and a bubble in the housing market. These excesses ended with a\nsevere financial crisis and the Great Recession.\nTo be sure, our understanding of inflation dynamics is imperfect. It is prudent for the\nFOMC to move cautiously and continue to monitor inflation developments to better understand\nthe causes and consequences of low inflation. In saying this, I recognize the various tradeoffs\nbetween maximum employment and price stability and their implications for financial stability\n\n5\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20030506meeting.pdf.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF NOON, CT/1 PM ET\n\nand sustainable economic growth. On balance, therefore, my judgment is that we should continue\nto make gradual adjustments to normalize policy rates.\nWaiting for solid evidence that inflation will reach 2 percent before taking further steps to\nremove accommodation carries risks of overheating the economy, fostering financial instability,\nand perhaps putting in motion an undesirable increase in inflation. Delaying monetary policy\nadjustments could further tighten labor markets and stretch the economy’s productive capacity.\nThe resulting inflationary pressures may build slowly, though they may be difficult to contain\nonce released.\n\nConclusion\nLow inflation, in itself, is not a problem in an economy that is growing and operating at\nfull employment. In such an environment, it is desirable to sustain the economic expansion by\navoiding overheating and financial market instability. The best way to do that is to gradually\nadjust policy rates to more-normal settings. With this approach, it seems reasonable to expect\nthat inflation will gradually rise as labor markets tighten further and the effects of past oil price\ndeclines, dollar appreciation, and idiosyncratic price movements fade.\n\n9\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 5, 2017\nInvesting in America’s Workforce Conference\nAustin, Texas\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 3:30 PM Central Time//4:30 PM Eastern Time\nI am pleased to have this opportunity to speak here in Austin. Understanding the\ndynamics of the nation’s labor market plays an essential role in the work of the Federal Reserve\nand for me as a regional Federal Reserve Bank president.\nIn my role, I meet with business, labor and community leaders throughout the Federal\nReserve’s Tenth District, which encompasses Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma,\nWyoming, and portions of Missouri and New Mexico. I regularly hear about the importance of a\nstrong alignment between employers’ needs and the skills available in the local labor force. The\nchallenge is to find the best opportunities and partnerships across a wide range of organizations.\nIn my remarks today, I’ll discuss the progress that has been made in the current economic\nexpansion toward full employment. I’ll then turn to longer-term shifts in the types of jobs that\nare offered by employers, and how these shifts in demand for skills have affected workers.\nFinally, I’ll conclude my remarks with some comments on the current stance of monetary policy\nas the Federal Reserve seeks to promote long-run sustainable growth by fostering maximum\nemployment and price stability.\n\nLabor Market Dynamics in the Current Economic Expansion\nThis is the 100th consecutive month of the ongoing economic expansion. In historical\nterms, it is the third-longest U.S. expansion on record going back to 1850. Total employment has\nincreased on net by 17 million workers since 2009, which is double the number of jobs lost in the\nmost recent recession. As employment has steadily increased, the unemployment rate has fallen\nfrom 10 percent in 2009 to its current level of 4.4 percent. This level of unemployment is below\nnearly all estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, which is the level of unemployment that\nis estimated to prevail in the longer run in the absence of cyclical fluctuations.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 3:30 PM Central Time//4:30 PM Eastern Time\nWhile the headline variables indicate that much of the labor market has returned to prerecession levels, other indicators reveal broader shifts taking place. For example, the percentage\nof people participating in the labor force has declined notably since the recession and has not\nmade much of a recovery. In 2007, 66 percent of the U.S. adult population (ages 16 and over)\neither had a job or were actively looking for employment. By 2015, the labor force participation\nrate had declined to 62 percent—this represents a shift of 10 million people out of the labor force\nbased on our current population. A large portion of this decline was due to the aging of the\npopulation, with many baby boomers reaching retirement age. However, some of the decline was\ndue to workers being discouraged about their job prospects and no longer seeking employment.\nOver the past two years, we have seen a modest pickup in the labor force participation\nrate, which is a sign of improving labor market conditions. Research by my staff has investigated\nthis improvement to better assess its underlying dynamics.1 While an increase in the participation\nrate may seem to suggest a surge of new workers entering the labor force, entries actually slowed\nin 2016. The increase in the participation rate was instead a result of a decline in the number of\npeople exiting the labor force. This decline, in combination with steady increases in employment,\nsuggests workers are now more attached to the labor force than in earlier years during the\nrecovery. As workers are matched to better and more stable jobs, the rotating of workers in and\nout of employment and in and out of the labor force slows. An additional contributing factor was\nthat the group experiencing the largest slowing in labor force exits was the population aged 55\nand older. This suggests that for older workers, the reduction in exits may indicate that some\nworkers were delaying retirement decisions.\n\n1\n\nTüzemen, Didem and Jonathan Willis. 2016. “What is Behind the Recent Increase in Labor\nForce Participation?” The Macro Bulletin, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, November.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 3:30 PM Central Time//4:30 PM Eastern Time\n\nJob Polarization\nDespite overall improvements in employment and the participation rate, we know there\nare still segments of the working-age population that have not experienced as much of a recovery\nas we would like. This group has been impacted by longer-term trends. In particular, workers in\nmiddle-skill jobs have seen the demand for their skills steadily decline. For decades, these jobs\nwere the gateway to the middle class.\nThe decline in middle-skill jobs is the result of a number of sweeping changes affecting\nthe economy. If we look back to the 1980s, examples of middle-skill jobs that were much more\nprevalent than we see today include assembly-line manufacturing jobs and clerical and\nadministrative positions. In 1983, nearly 60 percent of all jobs were in middle-skill occupations.2\nToday, that employment share has declined to 43 percent. Based on current employment levels,\nthis shift would be equivalent to moving 22 million jobs away from middle-skill occupations.\nMany of the employment opportunities in our economy have shifted toward high-skill\njobs, which are jobs that typically require a college education. Since 1983, the share of high-skill\njobs has increased from 26 percent to 39 percent.\nWhat is perhaps more surprising is what we have seen at the other end of the spectrum.\nThe share of employment for low-skill jobs has also increased, from 15 percent to 18 percent.\nWorkers in these jobs typically have little formal education beyond high school, and they work\nin occupations that are service-oriented and cannot be easily automated, such as food\npreparation, cleaning and security services.\n2\n\nTüzemen, Didem and Jonathan Willis. 2013. “The Vanishing Middle: Job Polarization and\nWorkers’ Response to the Decline in Middle-Skill Jobs.” Economic Review, Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, first quarter, pp. 5-32.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 3:30 PM Central Time//4:30 PM Eastern Time\nThis shift of employment toward both high- and low-skill jobs and away from middleskill positions has been labeled “job polarization.”\n\nJob Polarization: Gender and Race\nAs a result of this development, the current generation entering the workforce finds a\nvery different landscape than the labor market of the 1980s. How have new entrants to the labor\nforce adapted over time to be better prepared for the current labor market? Understanding these\ntrends is particularly relevant to those of you focused on developing today’s workforce.\nI’d like to use two demographic lenses to illustrate how the population is adapting to job\npolarization—looking first at shifts by gender and second at shifts by race.\nOver the past three decades, both men and women experienced declines in the shares of\nemployment in middle-skill jobs, but for different reasons. For women, the main losses in the\nshare of middle-skill employment were in office and administrative occupations, likely related to\nthe replacement of many secretarial and clerical jobs with desktop computing. For men, major\nlosses were in production occupations, likely related to the decline in employment in the\nmanufacturing industry.\nWomen and men responded very differently to these developments.\nFor women, the decline was accompanied by an almost equally large increase in the share\nof high-skill jobs, particularly in managerial, professional and technical occupations, such as\nengineering, finance, management and medicine. Based on the shift, women today occupy a\nlarger portion of high-skill jobs compared to the 1980s.\nFor men, the shift away from middle-skill occupations led to almost equal increases in\nthe shares of employment in both low- and high-skill occupations. Accordingly, a larger portion\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 3:30 PM Central Time//4:30 PM Eastern Time\nof low-skill occupations, which are primarily service jobs, are held by men today as compared to\nthe 1980s.\nGender differences in job shifts line up closely with gender differences in educational\nattainment. While levels of attainment increased for both male and female workers over the past\nthree decades, the change was more pronounced for women. The strong shift toward high-skill\njobs for women was associated with a large increase in the share of women with a bachelor’s\ndegree or higher. Educational attainment of men has risen more modestly, in line with the\nsmaller shift of male employment toward high-skill jobs.\nWhile we see very different responses to job polarization between men and women, the\nresponses across racial groups are more similar, with differences predominately reflecting\nhistorical disparities in levels of educational attainment.\nTo illustrate the responses to job polarization by race, I will focus on two groups, African\nAmerican and Caucasian workers, who together account for 90 percent of employment in the\nUnited States. First, however, let me describe the terms and information I’m using. The statistics\ncome from the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is the survey used to construct the\nunemployment rate. The terms I’ll use for race also require clarification. The terms African\nAmerican and black are used synonymously in the official data collection and so I will use the\nterm black to mean African American and white to mean Caucasian. Finally, I’d like to note that\nin this survey, Hispanic workers account for 16 percent of total employment, and many likely\nself-identify as white when identifying their race in the survey. They have the option of\nidentifying as Hispanic in a separate question on ethnicity.\nOver the past two decades, both white and black workers have experienced similar shifts\nin job opportunities consistent with job polarization. Both groups experienced a significant\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 3:30 PM Central Time//4:30 PM Eastern Time\ndecline in the employment share of middle skill jobs.3 And employment for both populations\nshifted toward high- and low-skill jobs, with a stronger shift toward high-skill jobs.\nWhile employment shifts were similar, white workers have had a consistently larger\nshare of employment in high-skill occupations. In 2017, 40 percent of white workers were\nemployed in high-skill jobs, relative to 30 percent of black workers. Both populations have a\nsimilar share of workers in middle-skill jobs—approximately 45 percent. This implies that there\nis a larger share of black workers in low-skill jobs than white workers: 24 percent of black\nworkers and 17 percent of white workers.\nAs employers have increased the share of high-skill jobs, workers have responded by\nobtaining higher levels of education than previous generations. The share of workers with a\nbachelor’s degree has increased by approximately 10 percentage points over the past two\ndecades for both black and white workers. But underlying this shift in educational attainment, a\npersistent education gap exists between black and white populations. In 2017, 36 percent of\nwhite workers had a bachelor’s degree, relative to 28 percent of black workers.\nThe difference in educational attainment is very important. It is increasingly challenging\nfor a worker to obtain a high-skill job without having a bachelor’s degree. During the past 20\nyears, workers with a high school diploma or some college education have experienced a\ndecrease in the likelihood of obtaining one of these jobs.\nOf particular concern is the divergence in opportunities between those with a bachelor’s\ndegree and those with some college education. For those with a college degree, the opportunities\nare clear: high-skill jobs. However, individuals with some college education or an associate’s\n\n3Kansas\n\nCity Fed Economic Research Department. 2017. “Assessing Differences in Labor\nMarket Outcomes Across Race, Age, and Educational Attainment.” Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City, Research Working Paper no. 17-03, April.\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 3:30 PM Central Time//4:30 PM Eastern Time\ndegree are struggling to find good employment opportunities. Especially in the case of black\nworkers, individuals with some college education are increasingly ending up in low-skill jobs.\nThe workforce development challenge is steadily shifting to how to best equip workers\nwith the skills in demand by employers. More than 60 percent of workers do not have a college\ndegree, and are thus most likely competing for middle-skill jobs. Employers will no longer\nsimply welcome a young worker with a high school diploma and say, “I’ll train you,” but are\nmore likely to ask, “What skills do you already have?” Young people today who do not see\ncollege as their best path forward need to have better awareness and opportunities for vocational\ntraining and post-high-school certification and training programs in areas such as skilled trades,\nhealthcare, and coding. With improved training, they will be better equipped for today’s middleskill jobs, which despite declines, still account for 43 percent of all jobs.\nThe Federal Reserve System is actively involved in a range of activities to promote better\noutcomes for workers. We are engaged in research, roundtable conversations with industry and\nlabor leaders, conferences like this one, and publications, such as our recent publication\nexploring workforce development policies for the 21st century.\n\nThe Role of Monetary Policy\nAs the Federal Reserve determines the appropriate settings for the nation’s monetary\npolicy, it must weigh a variety of economic factors, including the labor market trends that I have\ndescribed today. In the short run, I look across a wide range of business sectors and assess their\nperformance, monitoring their demand for workers in a tightening labor market and their capital\ninvestment plans. In the longer run, I evaluate trends such as job polarization and an aging\nworkforce, and consider what those structural forces imply for the Federal Reserve’s goals of\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 3:30 PM Central Time//4:30 PM Eastern Time\nmaximum employment and price stability. These are challenging economic factors to evaluate,\nwith different forces typically pushing the economy in different directions at the same time.\nMonetary policy is a blunt tool with limited ability to influence any specific segment of the\neconomy. It is most adept at addressing factors related to the business cycle and least adept at\naddressing the longer-run trends such as job polarization and an aging workforce.\nFor monetary policy makers, the key question centers on the appropriate level of\naccommodation, at this stage of the economic expansion, to best foster long-run sustainable\ngrowth. At the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Committee\nannounced plans to initiate its balance sheet normalization program in October. Large-scale asset\npurchases (LSAPs), better known as quantitative easing, or QE, transformed the size and\ncomposition of the Fed’s balance sheet from less than $1 trillion in mid-2008 to approximately\n$4.5 trillion today. This unconventional policy was implemented because the Federal Reserve’s\nconventional policy tool, the federal funds target rate, had been lowered to zero in December\n2008, and the Federal Reserve determined that additional measures were warranted. Beginning\nthis month, the FOMC plans to gradually reduce its securities holdings by decreasing\nreinvestment of the principal payments received from maturing securities. This gradual reduction\nin securities holdings will continue “until the FOMC judges that the Federal Reserve is holding\nno more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”\nIn regard to interest rates, the FOMC has maintained a very accommodative stance of\npolicy up to this point. The target range for the federal funds rate was set at the zero lower bound\nfrom 2008 until the end of 2015. Starting in December 2015, the federal funds rate has been\nraised a total of four times to its current target range of 1 to 1¼ percent. During this first phase of\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 3:30 PM Central Time//4:30 PM Eastern Time\nmonetary policy normalization, economic growth has remained above trend and the\nunemployment rate has declined from 5.0 percent to 4.4 percent.\nLooking forward, policymakers face the challenge of setting the appropriate path of\ninterest rates to promote the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nBased on my own economic outlook, further gradual rate adjustments will be needed to\nmove the federal funds rate toward its longer-run level. With an economy growing at an abovetrend rate and unemployment at a low level, postponing the removal of accommodation poses\nrisks to sustainable growth and financial stability. At this stage of the expansion, it is appropriate\nto move cautiously. But waiting too long risks more aggressive moves, which, history shows can\ninvite prospects of recession. And a continuation of current levels of accommodation risks\nsimilar distortions in capital allocation toward less fruitful, or perhaps excessively risky,\nendeavors that could result in financial imbalances.\nMoving interest rates at a gradual pace toward a level consistent with longer-run growth\nis the best step to help promote a continuation of the economic expansion. For the Federal\nReserve, such efforts are the most likely course, in my view, to meet our long-run goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. And by doing so, we can best foster conditions to\nsupport workforce development efforts to invest in workers and build a stronger economy.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nto the Board of the FDIC\non the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on simplifications to the capital rule\npursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996\n\nSeptember 27, 2017\n\nThis NPR is intended to simplify capital requirements and reduce regulatory burden for banks following\ncomments received during the EGRPRA process. Its preamble suggests it is designed to simplify the\nregulatory treatment for certain assets. However, in reviewing this NPR, I find that it is neither simpler\nnor less burdensome than the current rule. It is just different. Different, but it still remains overly\ncomplicated and burdensome offering mostly technical adjustments. It falls well short of achieving the\nkind of simplification that would provide truly meaningful benefit to the industry, investors, and the\npublic. Unfortunately, the proposed changes will only perpetuate the disparate capital benefits across\nbanks of different sizes and provide only minimal regulatory reporting relief.\nFortunately, we were able to include additional questions in the NPR so that the agencies can seek\ncomment on meaningful alternative proposals. There is one question in particular that I support –\nQuestion 14. Because the NPR was expanded to include this question, I am voting in favor of releasing\nthe NPR. I am particularly interested in receiving comments and encourage the nearly 6,000 banks of all\nsizes to address the question in the NPR. I think this is important enough that I would like to read\nQuestion 14 for the record:\nWhile the proposed rule addresses comments received during the EGRPRA review regarding the\ncomplexity of the risk-based capital standards, the agencies seek comment on additional\nalternatives to simplify and streamline the regulatory capital rules. The agencies recognize the\ndifficulties in achieving simplification of the risk-based capital standards, particularly the burden\nrelated to their calculation and reporting, and the potential disparate impact to smaller and\nmedium sized banks relative to their GSIB counterparts.\nTherefore, the agencies seek comment on whether they should consider a fundamental change\nto the manner in which banking organizations calculate and comply with minimum capital\nstandards such as through the use of a simple U.S. GAAP-based equity-to-assets ratio (leverage\nratio) for non-GSIB banks. If so, what would be the appropriate definition and level for the\nratio? Also, what relief should be realized upon implementation of this capital standard relative\nto changes in the call report and other reporting standards?\nCritics opposing the use of a leverage ratio for judging the adequacy of bank capital argue that it would\nencourage banks to “risk up” their balance sheets since required capital is the same for different assets.\nHowever, this NPR shows that the risk-based capital framework explicitly incentivizes the same type of\n“risk up” to balance sheets. Nowhere are the perverse incentives of risk-based capital as clear as in the\n\n\fproposed change to the treatment of commercial real estate. The NPR effectively lowers the assigned\nweightings on riskier commercial real estate assets from 150 percent to 130 percent without any change\nto underwriting standards, thus encouraging banks to leverage these riskier assets even further. The\nNPR then increases the weightings on less risky commercial real estate loans, mostly held by community\nbanks, thus penalizing their longstanding efforts to reduce exposure to higher risk and more volatile\ncommercial real estate transactions.\nFinally, I have long had concerns regarding the agencies’ well-intentioned but repeated failure to\nforecast and assign common risk-weights across the balance sheets for thousands of banks. The\nimposition of these rules, and their enormous cost on the industry and the public when they achieve\nsuch poor outcomes, is wasteful. A leverage ratio assumes no special regulatory clairvoyance regarding\na bank’s shifting risk. It is simpler to calculate and more understandable to the public and investors. It is\nless burdensome to report and more useful in judging the overall solvency of a bank of any size. It also\nrecognizes the ongoing role of the examination process in assessing a bank’s risk profile. If the industry\nwere to rely more explicitly on such a simplified measure, bankers could realize a significant reduction in\nreporting burden and better use those resources for lending and investing in their local economies while\nsimultaneously promoting safety and soundness.\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nSeptember 27, 2017\nBanking and the Economy: A Forum for Minority Bankers\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nKansas City, Mo.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for the opportunity to join you today. I am pleased to host this important event\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.\nThe Kansas City Fed is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the\ngovernment agency called the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., comprise the Federal\nReserve System, our nation’s central bank. The work of the Federal Reserve can be summarized\nin three primary mission areas: monetary policy, financial institution supervision and regulation,\nand payment services. And taken together, these activities are intended to maintain economic and\nfinancial stability as important conditions for the health of the U.S. economy and the prosperity\nof the American public. As a regional Federal Reserve president, I oversee the Kansas City Fed’s\nwork in these areas across a seven-state region with branch offices in Omaha, Denver and\nOklahoma City.\nIn my remarks today, I will offer a brief perspective on the performance of the nation’s\neconomy and the current stance of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. I’ll also discuss the\nimportance of access to credit in creating broadly shared economic growth, concluding with\nhighlights of how these issues affect communities, including minority communities. Before\ncontinuing, I must tell you that the views I share are wholly my own.\n\nThe U.S. economy\nThe U.S. economy is in reasonably good shape, with growth reported to have increased\n3.0 percent in the second quarter of 2017, a rebound from its weak first quarter pace. Consumers\ncontinue to be the main force behind this expansion, with consumption accounting for more than\ntwo-thirds of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). We also have recently seen business\n\n1\n\n\finvestment pick up, experiencing the strongest growth rate since mid-2014. Looking forward,\nwith accommodative financial conditions, elevated levels of consumer and business confidence,\nand a brighter global growth outlook, I expect the economy will continue to grow over the next\nfew years with low unemployment and low inflation.\nLabor markets have continued to strengthen with total employment increasing on net by\n17 million workers, which is double the number of jobs lost in the last recession. As employment\nhas steadily increased, the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to its current\nlevel of 4.4 percent. This level of unemployment is below nearly all estimates of the natural rate\nof unemployment, which is the level of unemployment that is estimated to prevail in the longer\nrun in the absence of cyclical fluctuations.\nAt last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the committee decided\nto maintain the current level of short-term interest rates, continuing an accommodative policy\nstance. Another important action was taken, however. The committee announced it would initiate\nthe process of normalizing its balance sheet.\nBased on my own economic outlook, further gradual rate adjustments will be needed to\nmove the federal funds rate toward its longer-run level. With an economy growing at an abovetrend rate and unemployment below most estimates of its long-run level, continuing to remove\naccommodation will be important for long-run sustainable growth and financial stability.\n\nAccess to credit\nAppropriate monetary policy settings serve an important role in sustaining growth in the\nlong run. But there are many other important factors that determine the nation’s economic\ngrowth, including a healthy and productive labor market, innovation and access to capital. I\n\n2\n\n\fwould like to turn to the issue of the availability of credit and its implications for the economic\nprospects of households and businesses.\nThe banking system in the United States has long been an essential source of capital for\nthe nation’s economy. Here in the Tenth Federal Reserve District, we have a large number of\ncommunity banks.\nHaving adapted over the years to significant economic and regulatory changes, as well as\ntechnology disruption, the community bank business model has retained its unique focus on\nrelationship banking. These banks, their owners and the people who work for them are generally\nmembers of the communities they serve. The relationships are long-term and the incentives of\nthe bank and the borrower are well aligned.\nWhether the community is a small rural town or an urban neighborhood —this business\nmodel features local bankers who are immersed in their communities, understand the economic\ndrivers of their communities and often serve as leaders in their communities. Those of you who\nare bankers here today recognize this critically important role, and your financial institutions\nhave recognized that this requires diverse staff reflecting the communities they serve.\nHowever, diverse talent in banks is just one aspect of serving a community from a base of\nunderstanding and personal engagement. Diverse ownership of banks is also important. Yet,\nthere are very few minority-owned banks in the United States today and their numbers are\ndeclining. Over the 10-year span since 2006 to the end of 2016, the total number of FDICinsured minority depository institutions has declined from 194 to 157.1 Within this category, the\nnumber of institutions classified as Native American or Alaskan Native American has held\n\n1\n\nData Source: FDIC-Insured Minority Depository Institutions data, year-end totals. Accessible via:\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/minority/mdi.html. Minority status is defined either by the\nconcentration of ownership status among a certain minority group or the concentration of board membership by a\nminority group of an institution that serves primarily that minority group.\n\n3\n\n\frelatively steady, falling from 20 to 18, while the number of Hispanic American banks has\ndropped from 48 to 39. The sharpest decline has been in the number of African American banks,\nwhich has fallen by almost half to 24 institutions, according to FDIC data.\n\nCommunity bank trends\nThese trends are not limited to minority banks, however. The number of banks in the\nUnited States has dropped considerably from a little more than14,000 in 1982, according to\nFDIC data, to around 5,000 today, and much of this decline has been in banks with less than\n$100 million in assets. How these consolidation trends affect access to credit is important to\nunderstand.\nYou have only to read today’s news to recognize the value of a local bank. It was recently\nreported that Bank of America, the second largest lender in the United States, has closed nearly\n1,600 branches since the financial crisis. These closures primarily impact rural areas. While\nsome branches were sold to smaller lenders, others were simply closed with customers directed\nto offices dozens of miles away.2 On the other hand, at about the same time this story was\nmaking headlines, another article highlighted efforts to save a community hospital in the\nMissouri boot heel region and the involvement of a community bank in providing its financing.\nAs the banker explained: “We knew what would happen to this community if that hospital\nclosed.”3\n\n2\n3\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/how-bank-of-america-ditched-1-597-branches-across-the-u-s-1505646000\nhttp://kcur.org/post/how-one-missouri-town-saved-its-hospital-financial-collapse#stream/0\n\n4\n\n\fThe historic role of minority-owned banks\nThroughout the history of our financial system, the inability to access credit often spurred\nthe establishment of a local bank. These banks often proved to be innovative lenders that\nconsidered the unique characteristics of local communities.\nMinority-owned banks emerged for the same fundamental reason, and their history tells\nan important story about access to the financial system, and understanding history is so important\nto understanding how to solve the challenges we face today.\nIn the Tenth Federal Reserve District, Centinel Bank of Taos, N.M., is a great example.\nCentinel is generally believed to be the first mainland U.S.-based Hispanic bank. If you were\nhere last year, you remember one of our speakers was Centinel’s chair and CEO, Rebeca Romero\nRainey. In 1959, Rebeca’s grandfather, who had served in the military and then earned a law\ndegree, was denied a $50 loan to purchase office furniture. At that point, he vowed to create a\nbank that would provide equal access to credit for everyone. After gathering support from about\n300 investors, the bank opened for business in 1969.\nMore recently, the first bank owned or controlled by a Native American tribe was created\nin 1987 when the Blackfeet Tribe of northwestern Montana took over a failed bank in the city of\nBrowning, Mont. Blackfeet National Bank later became Native America Bank, NA.\nWith some of the earliest African American banks, loans were primarily to mutual aid\nsocieties and entrepreneurs.4 The number of African American-owned banks increased\nsubstantially after 1900 and, between 1900 and 1914, the number of African American business\nenterprises doubled, with more substantial increases in some business segments, particularly\n\n4\n\nAmmons, Lia. “The Evolution of Black-Owned Banks in the United States Between the 1880s and the 1990s.”\nJournal of Black Studies, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Mar. 1996).\n\n5\n\n\fretail merchants.5 This was a notable expansion of opportunity compared to the late 1800s when\nthe primary occupations held by African Americans were blacksmith, tailor, barber and similar\njobs.6\nThe first banks with African American ownership opened during the Reconstruction\nperiod in our country. The first to receive a charter was The Savings Bank of the Grand Fountain\nof the United Order of True Reformers. In 1890, the bank’s founder, William Washington\nBrowne, explained his goal: “The True Reformers sounds like reformers of character, but we are\nhunting for people who are already reformed. The church …has the other kind of reformation in\nhand; mine is financial reform. I want to go forward reforming our people financially. We are\nthrowing away money enough to buy this country.”\nBrowne’s bank, and the others that soon followed his model, sought to provide services\nto customers who had suffered in many ways, including being exploited financially. Prior to that\nbank’s creation, the government had established the Freedman’s Bank in 1865 specifically to\nserve the nation’s African American population. Although the intentions were honorable and\nbranches were opened in several states in an attempt to connect to local populations, the bank’s\nleadership was not aligned with the needs of its communities. Instead, corruption and high-risk\ninvestments made with bank deposits resulted in its failure (despite the best efforts of Frederick\nDouglass, who had fought to save the institution after the damage had been done). In this era\nbefore deposit insurance, the collapse took with it the life savings of 61,000 savers who were\nstruggling to become established in the United States.\nBrowne’s life story is itself very much about the ability to overcome challenges and is as\ninspirational as any in American history. At age of 13, he escaped slavery and eventually joined\n5\n\nMeier, August. “Negro Class Structure and Ideology in the Age of Booker T. Washington.” Phylon. Clark Atlanta\nUniversity. Vol. 23, No. 3. (Q3, 1962).\n6\nIbid.\n\n6\n\n\fthe Union Army. After gaining an education in Wisconsin, he returned to the south as a teacher\nand served as a minister. Influenced by his experiences, Browne established the Grand Fountain\nof the United Order of True Reformers, a fraternal organization with the stated goals of taking\ncare of the sick, burying the dead and providing other assistance.\nBrowne had not necessarily sought to establish a bank to achieve personal goals. Instead\nthe bank was created in response to the needs of his organization, which reflected the needs of\nthe community. A Virginia chapter had been unable to organize because of difficulties safely\nstoring its treasury of about $100. Denied access to a traditional banking institution, the group\nhad to instead rely on the safe of a local storekeeper, which had proven problematic. The chapter\nwas ready to give up, but Browne encouraged them forward. Creating a bank provided a degree\nof security for the organization by meeting a very fundamental financial services need—in this\ncase, the bank was literally a response to the need for a safe place to store funds—but Browne\nknew, as we know today, that banks also foster opportunities. It was to be an economic win/win\n—a place to pool the resources of savers to meet the needs of borrowers.\nIn the words of one of Browne’s associates: “We mean to encourage … people to get\nhomes and means upon which they may independently subsist.”\nBrowne kept his word. Throughout the panic of 1893, which saw nearly 600 banks\nnationwide either fail or suspend operations, it is recorded that Browne’s bank was the only bank\nin the entire state of Virginia that continued paying out all checks. During the crisis, at least one\nlocal public school was able to obtain the funds necessary for paying salaries from Browne’s\nbank after being denied by other financial institutions. Similarly, the bank loaned money to the\nCity of Richmond in the early 1900s when the city was also unable to obtain funds from other\nsources. This is the story of community banks—saving the local hospital in Missouri today,\n\n7\n\n\ffunding Hispanic customers in 1969, and saving the city of Richmond in the early 1900s. An\ninstitution that is local enough to understand and meet the credit needs of a community\ndetermines whether that community thrives or withers.\n\nConclusion\nThis history is a reminder of the importance of access to credit and the role it plays in the\nprosperity of households and the vitality of businesses. In the words of one of Browne’s\ncontemporaries, “Banks are the life blood of trade and progress, whenever they may be\nestablished.”7 It is as true today as it was in 1890. And the health and diversity of our banking\nsystem remains key to the promise of delivering broad-based economic gains for thousands of\ncommunities and for the millions of households and businesses that they serve.\n\n7\n\nBurrell, William Patrick and Johnson, D.E.

            "content": "Statement of FDIC Vice Chairman Hoenig\non the semi-annual update of the Global Capital Index\n\nSeptember 26, 2017\nThe largest U.S. banks increased their capital levels in the first half of 2017, maintaining their\nstronger equity capital and stronger price-to-book value than their foreign counterparts,\naccording to data released today by FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig.\nThe average IFRS tangible leverage ratio – a measure of equity funding a bank’s assets for U.S.\nGSIBs - increased to 6.62 percent equity-to-assets at June 30, 2017, up from 6.28 percent at\nyearend 2016, according to the semi-annual update of the Global Capital Index (GCI). This\ncompares very favorably to most foreign banks reported in the GCI.\nAlso, U.S. GSIBs continued to trade at a premium, which has increased as their capital position\nhas strengthened, reporting a price-to-book ratio of 1.28 percent (column 12) over the past six\nmonths from a discount to book of 0.90 percent a year earlier.

However, this higher\nnumber occurs because assumed risk weighted assets represent only 43 percent of total assets\nmeasured under IFRS.

Hoenig on the FDIC Board Approval of an Interagency\nProposed Rule Related to the Retention of Certain Existing Transition Provisions for Banking\nOrganizations Not Subject to the Advanced Approaches Capital Rules\nAugust 22, 2017\nI strongly support the prudential banking agencies’ proposal to freeze the phase-in of the Basel 3 capital\nrules for community banks. Community banks engaging in traditional activities deserve meaningful relief\nfrom risk-based capital rules. They generally engage in less complex activities and have higher levels of\ntangible equity 1 than their larger bank counterparts, yet for the most part they have been subject to the\nsame restrictions under Basel 3. This disparity puts them at a competitive disadvantage and is one of\nmany factors negatively impacting the sector’s long term prospects.\nWhile this step to freeze the phase-in of Basel rules is important, our actions do not go far enough in\nproviding the permanent and comprehensive relief that community banks so badly need and that I have\nlong been advocating. Along the lines of my recommendations from 2015, such relief might be better\nachieved and sustained if predicated on a bank's activities and amount of tangible equity rather than\nasset size. Eligible banks would realize relief from not only Basel risk-based capital, but also from stress\ntesting, appraisal requirements, exam frequency, and many other rules as outlined in the term-sheet for\ntraditional banks. About 90 percent of the approximately 5,700 U.S. commercial banks meet the criteria\ndefining the business activities of a traditional bank, and two-thirds have capital levels that would allow\nus to credibly roll back these regulations.\nI hope the NPR we are approving is the first step in a more comprehensive approach to simplifying and\neasing the regulatory burden for community banks.\n###\nThomas M.

Unfortunately this is\nnot the case of the recently published supervisory guidance on the regulatory capital treatment\nof certain centrally-cleared, settled-to-market derivatives contracts, which may have its own\nnegative and unintended consequences. The guidance effectively lowers the amount of capital\nrequired for certain derivatives contracts although the underlying economics of the\ntransactions do not change. Under the Agencies’ interpretation of footnote 2 of section 34 of\nthe regulatory capital rule[1] the counterparties ostensibly settle on a daily basis, in effect\nlowering the potential future exposure of the derivative. However, the contract itself has not\nmatured and therefore the potential future exposure and risks of settlement remain.\nConsequently, the capital available to absorb these risks will be artificially lowered and the\nresidual burden shifted to the public.\n###\nThomas M.

Lee Smith and Timothy Todd assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 12:15 PM MT/2:15 PM ET\n\nI want to thank you for the opportunity to join you today. The Denver Branch of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City was created to serve as the central bank’s connection to\nportions of the Mountain West that are within the Tenth Federal Reserve District – Colorado,\nWyoming and northern New Mexico. To help us fulfill that responsibility, we rely heavily on our\ncontacts from within this community, including many joining us here today, as well as others\nacross the region to provide us with insight on emerging financial and economic conditions. The\ncontributions by these individuals are extremely important to me in my responsibilities\nrepresenting this region in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations, and I want to\nexpress my thanks to those who provide this valuable input.\nToday, I would like to talk about a topic that has been receiving much attention — the\nFederal Reserve’s balance sheet – and what it means when policymakers talk about its\nnormalization and ceasing reinvestments. Large scale asset purchases (LSAPs), better known as\nquantitative easing, or QE, have transformed the Fed’s balance sheet and sparked active debate,\nboth within and outside the FOMC, about the costs and benefits of this unconventional monetary\npolicy that was deployed during and after the financial crisis. Given the juncture we are at in the\nprocess of normalizing monetary policy, now is a useful time to revisit these issues based on\nwhat we know — and what we have yet to learn — about using the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet in this way.\nBecause the majority of my regional contacts are neither central bankers nor economists,\nI have focused my remarks today on providing a basic foundation for understanding this headline\nissue. I’ll begin my comments with a primer on the nature of the Federal Reserve’s assets and\nliabilities. Then, I will describe how the Fed’s balance sheet changed starting in 2008 based on\nFOMC decisions to make credit easier and provide more accommodation to the economy.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 12:15 PM MT/2:15 PM ET\n\nFinally, I’ll discuss some of the key issues policymakers are considering today and what I see as\npossible implications.\n\nInside the Numbers\nUnderstanding the Fed’s balance sheet requires some understanding of the Federal\nReserve System structure designed by Congress in 1913. The Fed consists of a government\nagency in Washington, D.C. known as The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and 12\nseparately-incorporated, nationally-chartered Reserve Banks. When we talk about the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet today, we are actually referring to the combined balance sheets of the 12\nindividual regional Federal Reserve Banks.\nThis combined balance sheet is audited annually by an independent audit firm, currently\nKPMG, and is made available to the public on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem’s website: www.federalreserve.gov. Also on this website are unaudited quarterly\nfinancial reports that include the combined balance sheet. And each week, generally late on\nThursday afternoon, changes to the Fed’s balance sheet are published on the website in the H.4.1\nstatistical release, known as “Factors Affecting Reserve Balances.”\nThe current $4.5 trillion balance sheet certainly stands out. The Fed’s assets primarily\ninclude a securities portfolio of System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings. The Fed’s\nliabilities primarily consist of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and depository institution\ndeposits.2\n\n2\n\nAdditional details on the composition of assets and liabilities in the Fed’s combined balance sheet at March 31,\n2017 can be found in the unaudited quarterly financial report, which is available online at:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/quarterly-report-20170331.pdf\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 12:15 PM MT/2:15 PM ET\n\nWhat is unique about the Fed’s balance sheet is its ability to expand and shrink as needed\nto facilitate the conduct of monetary policy in response to economic conditions. Conventional\nmonetary policy involves the buying and selling of securities. At the conclusion of each FOMC\npolicy meeting, a directive is communicated to the Federal Reserve’s open market desk, which is\nbased at the New York Fed. This directive also is communicated publicly in the FOMC’s post\nmeeting statement, which is heavily covered by the financial press.\nIn the case of a conventional policy tightening, the Fed’s open market desk will sell\nsecurities. The funds received from those sales will then be removed from circulation, reducing\nthe overall amount of available reserves in the banking system. The resulting smaller pool of\nreserves from which to lend increases the cost of borrowing – or to put it more clearly, interest\nrates move higher. If the FOMC decides to ease monetary policy, this process would work in\nreverse, with the Fed buying securities.\nThe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has grown considerably over the past decade. At\nnearly $4.5 trillion, it represents almost 25 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP) compared to just 6 percent of GDP in 2007. Liabilities of the Fed at that time were\ncomprised almost entirely of currency in circulation with reserves averaging about $10 billion.\nToday, reserves total more than $2 trillion. These reserves were created by the Fed to finance the\npurchase of long-term Treasury and agency debt during multiple rounds of large scale asset\npurchases, also known as LSAPs. Although the Fed stopped its program of expansionary bond\npurchases in October 2014, it has continued to reinvest the returns it receives from the maturing\nsecurities. As a result, the current size and composition of the balance sheet has remained\nunchanged for more than 2 ½ years.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 12:15 PM MT/2:15 PM ET\n\nThe Shift to Unconventional Policy\nIn the pre-crisis monetary policy framework, the Fed adjusted its holdings of Treasury\nsecurities to affect the amount of reserves in the banking system through the process I explained\nearlier. Due to the low level of excess reserves banks held at that time, modest adjustments in the\nsize of the Fed’s balance sheet influenced the federal funds rate, which is the rate that banks lend\ntheir reserves to each other overnight. When this was the key mechanism to influence monetary\npolicy, open market operations required a relatively small balance sheet with assets comprised\nprimarily of short-term Treasuries. However, this pre-crisis framework was challenged during\nthe global financial crisis.\nIn December 2008, the economic outlook deteriorated to the point that the FOMC voted\nto target a federal funds rate of zero to 25 basis points. Despite these extraordinarily low shortterm interest rates, longer-term rates for consumers and firms remained well above zero. The\ncombination of weakening economic conditions and effectively constrained short-term policy\nrates led the Federal Reserve to pursue a strategy of LSAPs to further ease monetary conditions.\nBy the nature of the fed funds rate, traditional monetary policy has a more substantial\ninfluence on the short-term securities market, providing a base from which yields extend across\nthe curve. LSAPs were designed explicitly to depress yields on longer-term securities through\nthe purchase of large quantities of assets. The initial round of purchases, which commenced in\nDecember of 2008, primarily targeted mortgage-related securities in an effort to put downward\npressure on mortgage rates and to help stabilize housing and financial markets. However,\nsubsequent rounds of asset purchases included longer-term Treasury securities in a bid to ease\nbroader financial conditions and foster overall economic activity. In these latter rounds of\npurchases, LSAPs evolved from a crisis response mechanism to a more general policy tool used\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 12:15 PM MT/2:15 PM ET\n\nto promote the Federal Reserve’s mandate to foster maximum sustainable employment and stable\nprices.\n\nJudging the Benefits and Costs of LSAPs\nThe use of the balance sheet as an instrument of monetary policy in this manner marked\nan important shift. With no experience on which to rely, the FOMC’s decision to undertake\nbalance sheet policy was not taken lightly. Arguments in favor of expanding the balance sheet\nfocused on the notion that by depressing longer-term yields and easing credit conditions, the\nFOMC could provide some stimulus to support the economic recovery. On the other hand, it was\nrecognized that there could be nontrivial costs associated with providing this experimental\nstimulus. These costs stemmed from the unintended consequences LSAPs could have on the\neconomy and financial markets, and the complexities associated with employing and exiting\nfrom such unconventional policy. Ultimately, the FOMC deemed the benefits would outweigh\nthe costs.\nWhile it is likely premature to fully judge the extent of the benefits versus the costs of\nLSAPs, a consensus of research does suggest that the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet has depressed longer-term interest rates. This has eased financial conditions,3 although\nsome of this effect assumes that the Federal Reserve will hold the assets it purchased for a\nprolonged period of time independent of economic conditions.\nResearch by my staff suggests that the Fed’s asset holdings continue to place downward\npressure on longer-term rates today – as they were intended to do.4 This effect, however, has the\n\n3\n\nSee, for example, Taeyoung Doh, “The Efficacy of Large-Scale Asset Purchases at the Zero Lower Bound,”\nEconomic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Q2 2010. Also, the Macro Bulletin cited below.\n4\nSee, for example, Troy Davig and A. Lee Smith, “Forecasting the Stance of Monetary Policy under Balance Sheet\nAdjustments,” Macro Bulletin, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 10, 2017.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 12:15 PM MT/2:15 PM ET\n\npotential to introduce new threats to economic stability going forward. Holding long-term rates\nbelow the level that they might otherwise move to naturally, amidst improving economic\nfundamentals, risks creating financial imbalances. History reminds us that it may be difficult to\ndetect such imbalances in real time and that they can only become apparent well after they\nmanifest. Looking across a spectrum of asset classes today, from real estate to equities to\ncorporate bonds, there is reason to remain vigilant despite the apparent tranquility in financial\nmarkets.\nIn addition to the potential costs associated with using LSAPs, some costs have become\nincreasingly visible as the FOMC begins to normalize monetary policy. For example, a large\nbalance sheet has made monetary policy more complex today than it was a decade ago. From an\noperational standpoint, the Federal Reserve has had to rethink its traditional approach to\ntargeting the federal funds rate in an environment of abundant reserves. In the process, the\nFederal Reserve has engaged an expanded set of counterparties and thereby expanded its\nfootprint in certain financial markets.\nFrom a communications perspective, the existence of multiple policy instruments has\nmade explaining the FOMC’s monetary policy strategy to the public more complicated. With the\nintroduction of LSAPs, the FOMC’s post-meeting statements became lengthier.5 These\nstatements now include not only the traditional policy directive and relevant details regarding\neconomic conditions and the outlook, but also address securities holdings acquired under the\nLSAPs.\n\n5\n\nThe first post-meeting public statement, issued in 1994, was a total of about 100 words. The length of policy\nstatements in recent years has increased to average more than 600 words.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 12:15 PM MT/2:15 PM ET\n\nThe Process of Normalizing the Balance Sheet\nAt its June 2017 meeting, the FOMC outlined its planned approach for reducing its\nTreasury and agency portfolio. Once initiated, the Committee intends to limit the pace at which\nthe FOMC’s portfolio is unwound by gradually decreasing its reinvestment of the principal\npayments received from maturing securities. Specifically, such payments will be reinvested only\nto the extent that they exceed preset rising caps, allowing the balance sheet to shrink in a slow\nand largely predictable manner.\nWhile the “how” of balance sheet normalization has been largely established, the “when”\nand the “how much” remain to be determined. In terms of “when,” the FOMC has indicated it\nexpects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided the\neconomy evolves broadly as anticipated. One reason I favor shrinking the balance sheet sooner\nrather than later is the observed disconnect between short-term rates and long-term rates. Despite\nfour 25-basis-point increases in the target funds rate since December of 2015, longer-term yields\nremain little changed.\nAccording to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median forecast\nin the so-called “dot plot” anticipates another 25-basis-point increase in the funds rate this year\nand three more increases next year. If further increases in the target funds rate fail to transmit to\nlonger-term yields, the yield curve could flatten further. Such a rate environment can distort\ninvestment decisions. To the extent that reducing our asset holdings will apply some modest\nupward pressure to longer-term interest rates, balance sheet normalization could promote the\nmore typical transmission of short-term interest rate changes throughout the yield curve and\nensure that all components of policy accommodation are removed in a gradual manner.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 12:15 PM MT/2:15 PM ET\n\nThe question of “how much” the Fed’s balance sheet will shrink also is an important\naspect of policy normalization, but has yet to be determined. The FOMC has said that it\nanticipates reducing the amount of reserves, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in\nrecent years but larger than before the financial crisis. The ultimate size of the Fed’s balance\nsheet will be influenced by a number of factors, including the public’s demand for currency in\ncirculation, decisions the FOMC makes about its securities portfolio and its long-run operating\nframework, and the economy. To improve the public’s understanding of balance sheet\ndevelopments, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s public website was recently updated\nwith projections for the long-run size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.6\n\nGauging the Implications of Balance Sheet Normalization\nI support the FOMC’s approach to balance sheet normalization and favor initiating the\nprocess in the near future, although I would have preferred to be starting the process with a\nsmaller balance sheet than exists today. As a voting member of the FOMC in 2013, I voted\nagainst the continuation of the asset purchase program known popularly as QE III. By then,\nfinancial markets were stable and the economy was growing. My concerns about the expansion\nof the Fed’s balance sheet under those conditions centered on many of the issues I’ve discussed\ntoday. In my view, the possible unintended side effects of the ongoing asset purchases posed\nrisks to economic and financial stability and served to unnecessarily further complicate future\nmonetary policy. I remain reluctant to advocate for the use of LSAPs in the future outside\nextraordinary circumstances.\n\n6\n\nhttp://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2017/07/just-released-updated-soma-portfolio-and-incomeprojections.html\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 12:15 PM MT/2:15 PM ET\n\nIt could prove to be the case that my concerns were misplaced. Certainly today’s\nfinancial markets are calm and labor markets remain robust. Recent “stress tests” suggest that the\nlargest U.S. banks are healthy for the most part. I hope such conditions point to a path of\ncontinued, stable economic growth.\nYet, my experience reminds me that imbalances can develop in sectors outside the lens of\nregulators and, as we witnessed a decade ago, can unwind with little warning. The current\ncombination of asset valuations —influenced in part by LSAPs — together with low levels of\nimplied volatility in equity and bond markets, could be signaling broader complacency in\nfinancial markets. For example, the failure of longer-term rates to move up with short-term rates\nduring this normalization cycle illustrates the risk for a disruptive repricing of assets as markets\nadjust to a more normal policy stance. The potential for such disruption highlights the essential\nnature of ensuring that our largest banks are indeed well capitalized and able to withstand the\nrepercussions of a financial shock. Although often noted as higher than a decade ago, equity\ncapital levels in these banks remain well below levels held by the nation’s community banks.7\nAssuring strong capital is particularly critical in light of focused efforts to ease various\nregulatory mechanisms that are designed to offset the systemic risk these large banks pose to the\nnation’s economy.\nAt the same time, the FOMC faces the unprecedented task of normalizing multiple\ndimensions of policy without impeding the economic expansion. Moving too fast could\nexcessively tighten financial conditions and slow the economy. Moving too slowly could cause a\nrelatively tight labor market to become further stretched beyond what is sustainable in the\nlonger-run. In either case, history shows that a policy mistake can invite a recession.\n\n7\n\nFDIC Global Capital Index: https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/global.html\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 12:15 PM MT/2:15 PM ET\n\nConclusion\nEven as short-term interest rates rise, monetary policy remains accommodative. Making\nadjustments to the Fed’s sizeable balance sheet is a necessary but unfamiliar part of the FOMC’s\npolicy process. As a result, the Committee has adopted a gradual approach to its policy\nnormalization approach. Removing accommodation in small doses, consistent with the pace of\nimprovement in the economy’s fundamentals, should allow Fed policy to evolve from fueling an\neconomic expansion to sustaining it.\n\n10\n\n\f"

            "content": "“Financial Markets and Accountability: A Better Way Forward”\n-- Remarks by FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig,\nPresented to the\nConference on Systemic Risk and Organization of the Financial System,\nChapman University,\nOrange, California\nMay 12, 2017\nIntroduction\nNotwithstanding the experience of 2008, the U.S. financial system remains heavily subsidized,\nincreasingly concentrated, and, despite a host of new efforts to safeguard the system, it\ncontinues to be vulnerable to inevitable financial shocks. I have long argued that we need an\norganizational model that would turn the industry back toward capitalism. Such a model should\nenhance the role of markets, allow for failure, and reduce reliance on intrusive regulations. Most\nimportantly, it should improve bank and economic performance.\nTo that end, I recently introduced “A Market-Based Proposal for Regulatory Relief and\nAccountability.” Among its goals are addressing too-big-to-fail, enhancing financial stability, and\nreturning the safety net to its original purpose of depositor and payment system protection. My\nproposal would require the largest banks to hold more capital, and it would partition nonbank\nactivities away from the safety net. Importantly, it also would create a more level playing field\nbetween insured and noninsured financial firms, thus enhancing competition.\nMy remarks today are intended to provide some additional perspective on that proposal by\ndiscussing the forces driving change within the industry and speculating on what they might\nmean for the future of banking and long-term economic growth. I will conclude by outlining how\nmy proposal is the preferable alternative for addressing too-big-to-fail, strengthening the\nfinancial system, and providing regulatory relief—all without compromising the public’s interest.\nForces of Change\nFor decades, until at least the late 1990s, the American banking industry was composed of firms\nwith a range of specialties and sizes, but all with a similar business model that relied heavily on\nintermediation—that is, taking deposits and making loans. The industry also was highly\ncompetitive with assets nearly evenly distributed among the various types of banks: money\ncenter, regional, and community.1\nIn more recent years, the largest banks have become disproportionately larger, and their\nactivities within the safety net have become far more extensive than those of most other\nfinancial firms. In thinking about the industry’s evolution toward this new order, four forces of\nchange have, in my estimation, been most influential: technology and financial engineering,\nlegislation, ownership structure, and of course the financial crisis of 2008.\nTechnology and Financial Engineering\nAs in all industries, technology has fundamentally altered the way banks operate. Tremendous\ndevelopments in computing power, data collection capabilities, and communication methods\nhave changed the supply chain for lending and how banks manage both sides of their balance\nsheets. Since operational efficiencies increase with scale, these advances have also\n\n\fencouraged industry consolidation, as the largest institutions gain the advantage in capturing\ndeposits, payments, and lending markets.\nTechnology also has enabled the largest banks to engage in financial engineering, which\nfacilitates product development and extends their business profile while also substantially\nincreasing product complexity and risk. Short-term wholesale funding instruments, such as\nrepos, rather than retail deposits now provides significant financing for loans. This change has\nfacilitated growth in products such as leveraged loans and securitized assets. It also has driven\ngrowth of derivatives and other short-term trading activities, all of which have contributed to a\ndramatic increase in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage among the largest, most systemically\nimportant banking firms.\nLegislation of the 1990s\nAnother force of change that helped shape the banking industry was legislation that relaxed\ngeographic, product, and affiliation restrictions on insured commercial banks, opening up\nmarkets and opportunities. Two significant laws enacted in the 1990s, when coupled with\ntechnological advances, accelerated institutional growth and changed the banking landscape by\nallowing for more product expansion and geographic reach during the past few decades.\nFirst, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 removed most of\nthe interstate banking restrictions that had been in place to address industry concentration and\nsupervisory concerns. The enactment of Riegle-Neal led to an acceleration in consolidation\nwithin the industry as banks merged across state lines to take advantage of economies of scale\nand to access new markets.\nNext, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 broadened the\nmarkets for commercial banking by formally removing barriers that prevented bank holding\ncompanies and their insured banks from owning other financial service providers, such as\ninvestment banks and insurance companies. Allowing the activities of these non-commercial\nbanking businesses to be subsidized with direct and indirect access to the federal safety net\ndramatically changed the competitive and cultural dynamics of commercial and investment\nbanking and potentially set the stage for, as some call it, the “financialization” of our economy.2\nOwnership Structure and Corporate Culture\nFollowing Gramm-Leach-Bliley, commercial and investment banks began a series of significant\nmergers that affected the combined industries in a profound way.\nInvestment banks originally were formed as partnerships, where owners were liable for all of the\nfirm’s debts. When the New York Stock Exchange relaxed its rules to permit joint stock\ncorporate ownership in 1970, over time it became an attractive opportunity for the investment\nbanking industry to grow and expand its business model. Investment banks that converted to\npublic companies altered the incentives of owners and management, increasing appetite for risk\nand leveraging balance sheets. The further effect of combining insured commercial banks and\ninvestment banks under Gramm-Leach-Bliley magnified these outcomes. In the end, there was\na profound change in industry culture that further changed the competitive dynamics among\nfirms. As universal banks formed and matured, and with increasing support from the expanding\nsafety net, the largest banks were increasingly drawn away from relationship banking and\n\n\flending and toward the higher risk-return model of the broker-dealer-investment bank focused\non trading and other fee-based income.\nFinancial Crisis of 2008\nOf course a pivotal force of change was the financial crisis of 2008 itself, out of which came\nmore than new legislation. The effect of the crisis on the U.S. economy, the numerous bank\nfailures, and the government’s response in addressing those failurdramatices accelerated\nindustry consolidation and altered its structure and direction in ways that will have lasting\neffects. JPMorgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns with government assistance, and subsequently\nacquired Washington Mutual after it failed. Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia. The government\ninjected capital into Citibank, thus bailing it out. Bank of America purchased Countrywide and\nMerrill Lynch, and later also received extraordinary government assistance. After the failure of\nLehman Brothers, regulators allowed two remaining investment banking firms, Goldman Sachs\nand Morgan Stanley, to become bank holding companies, providing them explicit access to the\nfederal safety net. In short, the crisis and government’s reaction to it quickly and dramatically\nchanged the composition and structure of the U.S. financial system.\nThe crisis altered the industry’s structure in other ways as well. Between 2008 and 2014, there\nwere 507 bank failures and 1,576 private mergers, mostly among community banks; and\npractically no chartering activity. Among regional and community banks, this trend toward\nconsolidation continues nearly a decade after the crisis.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nThe most recent force of change is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2010, enacted in response to the crisis. The law created mechanisms intended\nto better control the risk profile of the largest financial institutions and end too-big-to-fail. In\npursuing these goals, Congress chose regulatory control over structural change.\nWhile some structural changes were introduced, such as the Volcker Rule limiting insured bank\nproprietary trading and hedge fund activities, there has been little appetite in the United States\nfor breaking up banks or separating activities from the safety net within existing corporate\nstructures. Instead, new regulations have sought to define risk-based standards for allocating\ncapital and liquidity within a firm, while other regulatory tools such as living wills and orderly\nliquidation have sought to end too-big-to-fail.\nNotably, Dodd-Frank reflects a loss of confidence in markets, placing greater emphasis on\nsolutions that rely less on the market system while ceding more authority to individual\nregulators. This shift will almost certainly reshape the industry in the years to come.\nConcentration of Resources\nWithout question, the landscape of banking has been altered by the combination of technology,\nlegislation, and crisis. Looking back, the four largest U.S. banking firms in 1992 held roughly 14\npercent of total industry assets. Today, the four largest banking firms hold 42 percent of total\nindustry assets. Further, assets of these four largest are now approximately $7 trillion, an\namount equal to 38 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. To add further perspective, the 20\nlargest banks today hold more than 60 percent of industry assets.\n\n\fThese institutions have come to dominate the economy and financial markets in other ways as\nwell. Following the Great Depression, the financial sector’s share of U.S. corporate profits rose\nonly gradually for decades, reaching 23 percent in 1999, the year Gramm-Leach-Bliley was\nenacted. The financial sector’s share surged after 1999, exceeding 30 percent of total corporate\nprofits in four of the next five years, and stood at 28 percent in 2016. This migration of income\nfrom the real economy into the financial sector serves to confirm the “financialization” of our\neconomy.\nSome argue that we should not be concerned with these data because they represent less\nconcentration in the U.S. banking industry than elsewhere in the world. However, the rest of the\nworld is not the United States, which has thrived on small business and entrepreneurship and\nwhich, since its founding, has distrusted concentrated power. This wariness is particularly acute\nwhen it is perceived to be the result of power concentrated in a select few who influence the\nrules of the game.\nWhether one views these forces of change as positive, negative, or indifferent, it is inarguable\nthat they have transformed banking in the United States, giving us systemically important\nfinancial institutions, or SIFIs, that dominate the industry and increasingly dominate our\neconomy.\nThe Future of Banking\nTurning to what these forces and related trends portend, I would begin with the observation that\nthe largest U.S. banking firms will dominate the industry well into the future. They also will\ncertainly lead global banking. Having said this, I worry that there are forces in play that will\nadversely affect their performance and the economy more generally.\nFor these banks, the safety-net subsidy has been institutionalized, but at a cost in which\nregulatory oversight and control might impede the firms’ ability to adapt to change. Regulators\ninsist on promoting one-size-fits-all solutions for capital, liquidity, and resolution strategies in an\neffort to control the risks these banks pose to the broader economy. We can observe this\ntendency with debt being a central feature of Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)\nrequirements, regardless of a bank’s business model. Similarly, living wills increasingly reflect\nregulators’ preference for a single-point-of-entry strategy for resolution. Finally, the global\nregulatory community insists on pre-weighting assets for these firms when judging the adequacy\nand allocation of equity capital and liquidity positions.\nThis more intrusive regulation also creates its own barrier to entry into this segment of the\nindustry, which can stifle innovation among firms and reduce choices for customers. Such\ndevelopments will themselves become a drag on long-run economic growth. For example, as\nthe financial industry has become more concentrated, the average annual pace of real GDP\ngrowth has declined in each of the past three economic expansions, from 4.3 percent during the\nexpansion of the 1980s to just 2.1 percent during the current expansion. While many factors\ninfluence economic growth, the effects of regulation and market structure cannot be ignored.\nThe industry will also be influenced by the development of the so-called shadow banking\nindustry, where nonbank firms pursue opportunities outside the bank regulatory construct. Some\nof these firms will undoubtedly become influential and perhaps systemic. However,\ndevelopments here are not easily anticipated; their effects will depend on how large a role they\n\n\feventually play within the economy and on how prepared the banking industry is to absorb the\nshocks when one experiences stress or fails.\nImplications for Regional and Community Banks\nIf the above outlook for the largest segment of the industry is correct, then the stakes have been\nraised for regional and community banks as engines of economic growth. These banks, already\ncritical to job creation through their lending to small- and mid-sized businesses, will see\nincreased opportunities for lending and increased pressure to merge and expand their scale and\nfootprint as they seek success.\nRegional banks will continue to diversify their services to meet customer demand and\nsuccessfully compete at the edges of the SIFIs’ business domain. At the same time, they will be\ndrawn to consolidate. Just how quickly and to what degree is less certain. The market and\nregulatory barriers to entry into the realm of the largest and most powerful of the banking firms\nare substantial. It is unlikely that even the largest regional banks will gain a sufficient share of\nthe payment systems or provide the broad investment banking services necessary to threaten\nthe dominance of SIFIs.\nSmaller community banks most likely will operate in the same way as in the past, although they\nwill continue to narrow their business model to focus more on real estate and small business\nlending. Banks using this model have performed well in the post-crisis period despite the effects\nof near-zero interest rates. Indeed, community bank loans have grown by more than 8 percent\nannually for the past three years and outpaced U.S. economic growth in 2016 by three\ntimes. Community banks most likely will build on this model that provides a good source of\nincome. However, such a business model carries its own risk associated with concentrated\nassets, as witnessed by the more than 500 regional and community bank failures following the\nlast crisis.\nFinally, regulatory oversight will also play a greater role in shaping the future of regional and\ncommunity banks. Regulatory costs are proportionately greater for these institutions, as they\nhave fewer assets over which to spread costs. Such burden encourages further consolidation,\nall of which will affect the competitive vibrancy of the industry.\nOverall, reliance on the regulatory path in pursuit of safe banking continues a long trend within\nthe United States. The result has been and will continue to be an industry less influenced by the\nmarket and more influenced by regulators whose primary focus is on containing the risk and\ncost to the safety net, perhaps resulting in an inevitable slowing in economic growth.\nAn Alternative Path to Consider\nThe forces of change that I have outlined here beg the question of how best to proceed now that\nwe are nearly a decade past the start of the last crisis and have had time to reflect on the\nresponses and results. Should we back away from heavy reliance on regulation? Can we outline\nan industry structure that would better balance market forces and sound banking while\npromoting more rapid but sustainable economic growth?\nTo that end I recently offered a proposal3 in which universal banks would partition their\nnontraditional activities into separately managed and capitalized affiliates. The safety net would\nbe confined to the commercial bank, protecting bank depositors and the payment system so\nessential to commerce. Simultaneously, these protected commercial banks would be required to\n\n\fincrease tangible equity to levels more in line with historic norms, and which the market has\nlong viewed as the best assurance of a bank’s resilience.\nUnder this proposal, the largest, most complex financial holding companies would not be\nrequired to divest their current portfolio of activities such as that of the broker-dealer. The firms\nwould be allowed to continue operating these businesses and benefiting from the synergies of\ncommon ownership. But they would be required to place the operations in a separately\ncapitalized operating unit that, as such, would be insulated from the insured depository. To\npartition these activities effectively would require establishing an intermediate holding company\ncapitalized through the issuance of tracking shares tied explicitly to the economic performance\nof its nontraditional subsidiary, such as the broker-dealer. This is a practice increasingly\nemployed among commercial firms with operating units that differ in composition and\nperformance.\nThere would be other safeguards as well; for example, limits would be placed on the amount of\ndebt the ultimate parent company could downstream to subsidiaries and on affiliate transactions\nwith the insured depository. Such a structure would necessitate independent market-driven\ncapital and liquidity requirements, and it would provide far greater transparency and better\npricing of risks among operating units. Taken together, the intermediate holding company’s\nstakeholders would require that it be appropriately capitalized and able to function on its own.\nWhile the proposal would inhibit the intermingling of funding and operations between affiliates,\nwhich is advantageous during good times, it would provide far greater advantages during bad\ntimes. Most importantly, over the business cycle, it would provide for more stability and more\nconsistent economic growth. Additionally, such a structure would facilitate resolution using\nbankruptcy, with less likelihood of precipitating multiple failures or a crisis. These advantages\noffer a real opportunity for significant reductions in regulatory burden, including, for example, the\nelimination of risk-based capital and liquidity, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR), Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST), Title II and Living Wills, and parts of the\nVolcker Rule, among others.\nFinally, this alternative approach is intended to be supplemented with strong supervision that\nreemphasizes the importance of management and examiner judgment in gauging safety and\nsoundness, which currently has been substituted for prescriptive rules and regulations reliant\nupon backward-looking regulatory estimation and the use of complex models.\nConclusion\nAs I observed at the start of my remarks, the U.S. financial system remains heavily subsidized,\nincreasingly concentrated, and less competitive than at any time in recent history. And it\ncontinues to be highly vulnerable to unexpected financial shocks. As we again attempt to\naddress these unresolved issues, we have an opportunity to better balance regulation and\nmarkets and to improve industry performance, innovation, and economic growth.\nUnder the proposal I offer, we could achieve many of these outcomes. Not surprisingly,\nhowever, the most vocal criticisms of the proposal come from those who benefit most from the\nsafety net’s rich subsidy. I respect the right of those who oppose such a solution and encourage\nthem to speak out. Indeed, the American public should insist that regulators and the industry\ngive their full attention to and engage in an open discussion of the implications of the current\nstate of the industry, its growing power and influence in Washington, and its long-run effects on\n\n\fgrowth and jobs for our economy. This is nothing less than a discussion about the future of\ncapitalism and economic opportunity for our country.\n###\nThomas M.

And its namesake,\nHenry Bloch, serves as a worthy example of the school’s mission to develop purposeful,\nentrepreneurial and innovative leaders to meet changing global demands, and advance\nknowledge and practice through excellent teaching, scholarship, outreach and service.\nCongratulations. You’ve earned a college degree, and that achievement alone gives you\nan advantageous seat at the table of the U.S. economy. By completing a bachelor’s or graduate\ndegree, your chances of getting a job are pretty good. Last year, the unemployment rate for\ncollege graduates was only 2.5 percent – it’s more than twice that rate for those without that level\nof education. 1 And not only are your chances good for landing a job, it’s likely that you’ll be\npaid more for it. The median income of a worker with a Bachelor’s or higher degree is more than\n40 percent above the overall median income.2\nThose facts paint a very favorable picture of your future. Unfortunately, the advantages\nyou have today are not guarantees of future success. Take a careful look at your diploma. You\nwon’t see fine print with any such guarantee.\nThat’s because tomorrow you will join the ranks of millions of other college graduates in\na workforce where more than one-third of all workers have at least as much education as you if\nnot more. So what happens from here is up to you, but that’s only partially true. Your lot in life\n\n1\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data updated April 20, 2017: https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm\nNote workers age 25 and older. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

To put it simply…..Life will happen.\nSo what exactly does the path to success look like? Here’s a spoiler alert. I think I know\nmost of the ingredients, but I don’t have the recipe.\nWhen I meet with new employees at the Kansas City Fed, they often ask me about my\nown career path and whether I knew early on that I wanted to be the president and CEO of a\nFederal Reserve Bank. The truth is I had no such goal. In fact, I had neither a plan nor a carefully\nconstructed series of strategic moves to reach the position I’m in today. I was focused on making\na living. Along the way, I worked hard and found the work I did meaningful and challenging.\nAnd each assignment became the rung to the next one.\nToday, as I look back at my own path, I can see that any measure of success I realized\nhad much to do with the experiences and lessons I learned along the way. I’ve condensed those\nyears of experiences and lessons learned into five simple rules. They’ve served me well. And as\nyou move into the ranks of the dreamers and doers, you might consider them:\n1) Be prepared: There really are no shortcuts to doing your best. Few people can\nsuccessfully wing it. Most of us have to spend time and make sacrifices to be prepared for that\ninterview, to complete a job assignment on time, to earn a raise. But that preparation arms you\nwith knowledge and gives you confidence.\n2) Be flexible: Things won’t always go as planned. And sometimes, we build plans that\ncan fall apart. If you can learn to accept that life is unpredictable and full of change, you’ll be\nable to adapt and cope.\n3) Be brave: You will have to make choices of consequence. It is not always clear what\nthe right answer is, but make sure you ask the right questions. And then choose.\n\n\f4) Be humble: Regardless of how confident you may be, you are not always right. Listen\ncarefully to others. You might learn something.\n5) Be grateful: Everyday someone is doing work that makes your job easier, safer and\nless stressful. Look around you today—I suspect some of those people are right here.\n\nAs you come to this stage to accept your diploma today, I hope you enjoy the feeling of\naccomplishment. But I would encourage you not to confuse this achievement, and those to come,\nwith making your mark in other important ways. As you strive for success – and you should –\nkeep your focus on the things that define who you are and what you stand for: your values, your\nintegrity, your work ethic, your service to others. These are within your control and these are\nwhat matter in the long run. If you focus on these, regardless of whether you achieve your best\ndreams and hopes, whether you get the next promotion, or secure wealth or fame, you will have\naimed for those things in a principled way.\nJohn Adams, one of America’s founding fathers, expressed this sentiment well. During\nsome of the darkest days of the American Revolution, he worried about whether the struggle for\nindependence would be won. In a letter to his wife Abigail in 1776, he made a profound\nstatement when he wrote, “We can’t guarantee success, but we can deserve it.”\nAnd so it is for each of you. The degree you are about to receive does not represent what\nyou know, but what you are capable of learning. So choose your path carefully. Because the\nworld is looking to you to tackle the challenges we face, to repair the divisions we see, and to\nbuild on the opportunities ahead of you. And whatever the outcome, and however success will be\ndefined for you, if you go about it in the right way, you too can deserve it.\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMay 9, 2017\nRipple Effects\nThe University of California, Santa Barbara’s 36th Annual South County Economic Summit\nSanta Barbara, Calif.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 8:40 a.m. PT/11:40 a.m. ET\n\nIt’s a pleasure to join you today for this annual Economic Summit. As a Federal Reserve\npolicymaker, I took particular note of the theme for this year’s event. Thinking about the ripple\neffects of monetary policy is something that occupies a great deal of my time and focus. Not only\nconsidering how those effects ripple through the economy but also how they ripple through time\nand the implications that those policy actions can have well into the future.\nToday, I am going to be sharing with you my views on recent economic developments\nalong with my thoughts on the outlook for the national economy and the appropriate course of\nmonetary policy. I want to stress that these views are my own and not those of the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy’s average 2 percent growth rate is quite modest by historical\nmeasures. Expansions dating back to 1961 have produced growth of some 4.1 percent on\naverage. But what this current expansion has lacked in strength, it has made up for in longevity.\nApril marks the 94th consecutive month of growth, making it the third-longest U.S. expansion on\nrecord going back to about 1850.\nOver this recovery, the U.S. economy has witnessed a remarkable improvement in labor\nmarkets. The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10 percent to 4.4 percent today.\nGranted, this is a broad measure, and it is true that some areas of the labor market could benefit\nfrom further improvement. Rather than picking and choosing which indicators best describe the\nstate of the labor market, Kansas City Fed staff looked at how we could summarize 24 different\nlabor market variables by creating two indicators: one that looks at the level of labor market\nactivity, and the other at the momentum of that activity. The most recent results confirm\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 8:40 a.m. PT/11:40 a.m. ET\n\ncontinued strength. Both indicators were above their historical averages, suggesting a somewhat\n“tight” labor market with forward momentum pointing to continued improvement. In fact, the\nmomentum indicator is at its highest level in the history of the series, which goes back to the\nearly 1990s.\nWith labor markets showing little or no slack, why then did real Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP) only grow 0.7 percent in the first quarter? Importantly, does this weakness call for the\nFederal Reserve to pause its process of normalizing monetary policy?\nFor a number of reasons, I think the answer is “No.”\nFirst, some of the weakness reflects unusually mild winter weather that led consumer\nspending on housing and utilities to decline sharply in the first quarter. Although such an effect\ntemporarily reduces measured output, it is clearly not cause for concern. In fact, household\nsaving increased by over half of a percentage point between December and March, likely\nreflecting lower utility bills.\nThe second reason is a more technical one – what economists call “residual seasonality.”\nNamely, despite the best effort of statisticians to smooth through predictable seasonality, we\nhave seen a pattern emerge in recent years in which measured growth is weaker in the first\nquarter than it is during the rest of the year. I suspect we are seeing this same dynamic, at least in\npart, in 2017.\nThe third reason is that economic data is subject to dips and spikes. Despite best efforts,\nmeasuring a dynamic, $19 trillion dollar economy is an extremely difficult task. As a result, we\nshould be careful not to overreact to every move in reported data. To illustrate some of the\nchallenges in measuring economic activity, my staff recently issued a report on the so-called\nsharing economy, a business model in which customers who are looking for rides or rooms,\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 8:40 a.m. PT/11:40 a.m. ET\n\namong other goods and services, are matched with providers via online platforms.1 While this\ntype of activity remains too small to affect our understanding of recent macroeconomic trends,\nthe report highlights some of the difficulties statisticians face when trying to capture emerging\neconomic trends.\nAs we consider these factors affecting the nation’s GDP, we are likely seeing a\nsignificant amount of noise. The core signal, I believe, may have more strength than what we are\ncurrently able to determine.\nStill, interpreting the data is a balancing act. Just as one should not overreact to each\nsingle data point, it is important to watch for signals that could mark a turn in the economy. For\nexample, one area I am watching closely is auto sales. After setting a record last year with 17.5\nmillion light weight vehicles sold, the pace of vehicle sales slowed in the first quarter. Recentlyreleased data for April did rebound a bit to just under 17 million on an annualized basis, but sales\nremain below last year’s level. Some cooling raises questions about softening consumer demand.\nOn the other hand, indicators of consumer sentiment remain high, gas prices remain low,\nhousehold balance sheets are, on average, healthy and other fundamentals suggest consumers\nhave the ability to continue spending.\nAll told, while the recent GDP report and auto sales may be flashing yellow, numerous\nother indicators remain solid green. In particular, consumer and business confidence remain\nstrong, as do surveys of business conditions. For example, the ISM manufacturing index, which\nsurveys manufacturing firms across the U.S. about business conditions, has been signaling a\nstrengthening manufacturing sector over the last eight months. Its nonmanufacturing counterpart,\nwhich covers the broader services sectors, has also been solid as of late.\n1\n\nRedmond, Michael. 2017. “Waiting for a Pickup: GDP and the Sharing Economy,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City, The Macro Bulletin, April.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 8:40 a.m. PT/11:40 a.m. ET\n\nLikewise, global economic conditions have improved, supporting exports, and downside\nrisks posed by China and Europe have diminished. Given the strength of fundamentals across a\nrange of sectors, I expect the economy to continue growing at a slightly above-trend rate.\nWith this outlook, I view inflation dynamics as broadly consistent with the Federal\nReserve’s goal of price stability. Personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation was 1.8\npercent over the past year after averaging just 1 percent for much of 2016, and core inflation has\nbeen trending up. Its unexpected decline in March appears to reflect some one-off factors as\nopposed to broader disinflationary pressure. It seems reasonable to look through this volatility,\nwith labor markets continuing to improve, and longer-term inflation expectations staying\nanchored near 2 percent.\n\nThe Balance of Risks\nDeveloping an outlook for the economy requires not only judging the health of the\neconomy over a medium-term horizon, but also requires an assessment of the nature of risks to\nthat forecast. Now that the U.S. has largely recovered from the Great Recession – the\nunemployment rate is below its estimated longer-run level, real gross domestic product (GDP) is\ngrowing slightly above its estimated trend, and inflation is near the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) longer-run objective of 2 percent – I will turn to my thoughts on the\nbalance of risks. And here I would point out an important shift in the FOMC’s assessment of\nrisks since it took its first steps to normalize monetary policy in December 2015.\nAt that time, inflation was moving closer to the FOMC’s desired 2 percent objective, and\nthe labor market reflected substantial improvement. However, nearly half of the FOMC\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 8:40 a.m. PT/11:40 a.m. ET\n\nparticipants continued to view the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside – highlighting\nconcerns that inflation might start to move further below the objective.\nA year later, with sustained improvements in the labor market and progress toward the\nCommittee’s inflation objective, the FOMC took a second step toward monetary policy\nnormalization, raising short-term interest rates another 25 basis points. By then, the assessment\nof risks had changed. An overwhelming majority of participants viewed the risk to their inflation\nforecasts for 2017 as broadly balanced, and a few more reported that risks were weighted more\nto the upside than the downside.\nThe same is true for judgments about risk to the outlook for the unemployment rate. A\nlarge majority currently sees risks as broadly balanced, but a few participants see risks that the\nunemployment rate is more likely to be even lower than their projection.\nThe assessment that risks to the unemployment rate are balanced right now is a\nreasonable one, although having the unemployment rate fall below its longer-run level is not\nwithout risk. At 4.4 percent, the unemployment rate is already below the FOMC’s median\nestimate of the longer-run unemployment rate, and overshooting poses risk to the sustainability\nof the expansion. Past episodes to push unemployment lower than its longer-run level have\nended in recession, and for that reason, adjusting policy to ensure the economy remains on a\nsustainable growth trajectory is of paramount importance.\nOthers may argue that concerns about the economy potentially overheating are\nexaggerated. For example, the link between low unemployment and rising wages is weaker than\nit was a few decades ago. This means tighter labor markets may be unlikely to generate as much\ninflation as in the past. While I acknowledge that the link between real activity and inflation\nappears to have diminished, there could very well be conditions when the relationship reasserts\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 8:40 a.m. PT/11:40 a.m. ET\n\nitself. That is, under tight labor markets, employees may find themselves with significantly more\nbargaining power to negotiate for higher wages, which in turn could translate into more\ninflationary pressure.\nAnother point often raised to suggest the Federal Reserve need not be overly concerned\nwith tight labor markets is that inflation has been running below the FOMC’s 2 percent goal for\nan extended period. Such low rates of inflation seem to have lowered longer-run inflation\nexpectations. Given the inflation goal is symmetric, meaning that the Committee gives equal\nweight to deviations above and below the goal, some argue there is scope to let inflation drift\nabove 2 percent for a time, particularly if it would help anchor expectations more firmly around\n2 percent.\nI have not yet found this argument compelling. The most recent estimate from the Survey\nof Professional Forecasters points to future levels of inflation slightly above the FOMC’s 2\npercent goal. In fact, some consumer expectations of inflation have slipped, but not sufficiently\nto suggest they have become fundamentally unanchored from the inflation goal.\n\nMonetary Policy\nLast week, the FOMC took no action to change policy, although it remains on a path to\nremove accommodation in a gradual manner. Given my own economic outlook and assessment\nof the balance of risks, I support this policy path.\nIt is worth noting that even as the FOMC has increased short-term rates, financial\nconditions remain accommodative. Looking at the Kansas City Fed’s Financial Stress Index,\nwhich synthesizes 11 financial market variables, the index has generally declined over the past\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 8:40 a.m. PT/11:40 a.m. ET\n\nsix months despite two rate increases. Thus, the modest amount of removal of monetary\naccommodation has had little notable effect on broader financial conditions.\nLooking ahead, a natural question is how gradual will the monetary policy normalization\nprocess be? According to the Fed’s Survey of Economic Projections, the median calls for another\n2 moves this year and financial markets appear to expect another 1 or 2 moves. The FOMC has\njudged that moving gradually is appropriate. Understandably, moving too aggressively risks\nslowing economic activity or even derailing the expansion. Removing accommodation in small\ndoses is consistent with the economy’s improving fundamentals and perceived benign rates of\ninflation.\nAlternatively, policy cannot move too gradually. Postponing the removal of\naccommodation when the economy is at full employment and inflation near 2 percent poses risks\nto longer-run economic and financial stability. Moving too slowly carries the risk of pushing the\nunemployment rate below its sustainable rate and inviting recession as history shows. Failing to\nkeep interest rates in line with improving fundamentals also can distort the allocation of capital\ntoward less fruitful, or perhaps excessively risky, endeavors.\nAs monetary policy continues on a gradual path of tightening, questions emerge about the\nimpact to those sectors of the economy that are especially interest rate sensitive. This concern is\noften associated with the housing sector. However, I would note that the housing market has\nchanged significantly over the past decade. While demand fueled rising home prices prior to the\nfinancial crisis, it seems that lack of supply is now the dominant factor. For example, research by\nmy staff suggests the number of households is at least 3.5 million below its trend, even after\naccounting for demographics and changes in preferences. The unmet demand for housing may\nface a more persistent lack of supply, due in part to limited land available for development in\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 8:40 a.m. PT/11:40 a.m. ET\n\ndesirable areas. Conditions vary across regions, but with a limited supply of housing and a strong\nlabor market, prices are likely to continue rising even as interest rates gradually go up. Even with\nsuch conditions, while higher home prices may boost measures of household wealth, those\nhouseholds that spend a relatively larger share of their income on shelter will face challenges.\nFinally, removing policy accommodation goes beyond increasing the level of the federal\nfunds rate. The FOMC also must begin to adjust the size and composition of its securities\nholdings. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is currently about $4.5 trillion, or almost 25\npercent of GDP compared to 6 percent of GDP 10 years ago. The composition of this balance\nsheet has changed as well. Ten years ago, the balance sheet was primarily comprised of shortterm Treasuries. Today, mortgage-backed and agency securities make up about 40 percent of\nassets.\nWith these changes, the FOMC faces unprecedented challenges for its decision-making\ntoday, such as when to begin the process of reducing the size and altering the composition, and\nhow to communicate the approach and the timing to the public. My own view is that the process\nshould begin sometime this year by reducing reinvestments in mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS) and long-term Treasury securities. Once it begins, however, the runoff in the portfolio\nshould be on autopilot and not reconsidered at each subsequent FOMC meeting. Otherwise, the\nCommittee would need to re-evaluate and make adjustments that will potentially complicate\nmonetary policy and provide few benefits to the real economy.\n\nConclusion\nThe economy continues to expand as sustained job growth and solid gains in household\nspending – the weak first quarter notwithstanding – are mutually reinforcing. The international\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT SPEECH TIME OF 8:40 a.m. PT/11:40 a.m. ET\n\nbackdrop poses less downside risks today, further supporting growth at home. In this\nenvironment, the role for monetary policy is to support the sustainability of the expansion.\nTherefore, as labor markets continue to tighten, continuing the gradual removal of monetary\naccommodation is the appropriate course for the FOMC.\n\n9\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMay 4, 2017\nFaster Payments Task Force Meeting\nChicago, Ill.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the\nFederal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fGood morning. It is my pleasure to join you today to recognize the tremendous\ncontributions you’ve made to this public-private effort aimed at improving the nation’s\npayments infrastructure. This is one of the most ambitious undertakings in the history of\nour country’s payments system and one that is essential to the growing and evolving\ndemands of businesses and consumers. I also want to thank Gordon Werkema and his\nteam for the expertise and leadership they’ve brought to this engagement on behalf of the\nFederal Reserve.\nCharting a course for faster payments has been demanding, but the progress\nwe’ve seen is rewarding. It signals that even as more work lies ahead, we can build on\nthe experience of the past two years to achieve the desired outcomes identified in the\n2015 paper Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System. This morning, I’d like to\ntalk briefly about the progress achieved to date and then offer my thoughts on the road\nahead for the Federal Reserve and the payments industry.\nBefore I continue, now would be a good time to remind you that the views I\nexpress here are my own and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nProgress report\nIn 2012, the Federal Reserve was among those noting that the U.S. payment\nsystem was undergoing a period of rapid change, and contemplating the implications.\nConsumers and businesses were turning increasingly to e-commerce and Internet-enabled\ntechnologies. In the midst of this transition, payment security was being challenged by\nnew, dynamic, and escalating threats.\nTraditional payment services had been adjusting slowly to these changes, while\nemerging players were coming to market with innovative product offerings. Avoiding\n1\n\n\ffragmentation and facilitating end-to-end adoption required a more coordinated rather\nthan organic approach to ensure that issues of access and security could be broadly\nconsidered.\nA path forward took shape with extensive industry dialogue in the form of the\nStrategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System paper published in 2015. Within the\npaper were strategies based on five desired outcomes for improvements in the following\nareas: speed, security, efficiency, cross-border payments and industry collaboration.\nAs this group knows better than anyone, industry stakeholders and the Federal\nReserve have invested significantly over the past two years in efforts to advance toward\nthe desired outcomes outlined in that paper. While some thought our efforts would fall\nvictim to proprietary interests and a lack of cooperation, substantial measureable progress\nhas been made on a number of issues and there is significant momentum towards\naddressing some of the more intractable issues that will demand a more sustained focus.\nEarlier this year, the Task Force released Part One of its final report and I look\nforward to seeing Part Two when it becomes available this summer. Once completed,\nthis document will share assessments of proposals for faster payments solutions and\nrecommend next steps for the industry to take to achieve safe and accessible faster\npayments capabilities. Together, these documents will provide a comprehensive report of\nthe Task Force’s work. Feedback from private sector providers suggests they have found\nthis work to be worthwhile and promising as they seek to design and deliver faster\npayment capabilities to end users.\nOf course, while the Task Force has been at work on these issues, the payments\nsystem has continued to evolve. Innovation and new capabilities have emerged from the\nprivate sector and the Federal Reserve also has continued to improve the services it\n2\n\n\fprovides. For example, same-day ACH credit payments began flowing through the\nnetworks last fall, with 13 million payments cleared same-day in the first 100 days.\nAlthough not real-time, this development is an important and tangible step toward faster\npayments in the United States. Additionally, global messaging standards (ISO 20022)\nhave been adopted for better interoperability. Innovations in the card space now facilitate\nreal-time P2P transfers via credit push. And many fintech and social media entities are\ndelivering payment services with some real-time attributes through stored value or card\non file models. The payments industry is also exploring models that leverage virtual\ncurrency and distributed ledger technology in delivering faster payment solutions.\n\nThe Road Ahead\nWhile the efforts of the Federal Reserve and the Faster Payments Task Force have\ndriven significant progress, we recognize that the desired outcomes identified in the 2015\npaper have yet to be realized. With continuing technological innovation and the\nemergence of new potential security threats, real work remains if we are to achieve and\nmaintain a safe, ubiquitous, faster payments capability.\nOngoing innovation and market activity, including a variety of proposals\nreviewed by the Task Force, suggests the potential for multiple solutions in the faster\npayments market. However, the lack of established industry standards and rules could\nhinder interoperability of these solutions, resulting in fragmentation and inhibiting\ncompetition over time. Such conditions could negatively affect the ability to “pay\nanyone” and constrain access and adoption. Study of the payment system also teaches\nthat over time, consolidation of providers seeking economies of scale and scope may\noccur, adversely affecting competition, an essential ingredient to innovation and serving\n3\n\n\fthe needs of consumer and business end users. I am encouraged by the amount of\nattention that you’ve given to considering these kinds of critical issues and challenges.\nFurther progress is needed in other aspects as well. As highlighted in the\nStrategies paper, developing settlement services to support real-time payments is yet to\nbe addressed. Faster payment capabilities that rely on current settlement systems would\nhave end user service gaps or real-time end user service offerings with deferred\nsettlement. Deferred interbank settlement could create credit or liquidity risks for\nfinancial institutions and potential risk for the financial system. We will continue to\nwork with the industry to understand such issues as solutions are implemented.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s role\nOver the next decade, I anticipate that changes to the payments system will only\naccelerate, but in uncertain ways. As it has done in the past, the nature of the Federal\nReserve’s engagement going forward will likely evolve.\nThe Faster Payments Task Force is only the most recent example of the\ncooperation between the Federal Reserve and the private sector that has historically\ncontributed to a more efficient and effective payments system. This history includes the\ndevelopment of routing numbers, the growth of the automated clearing house network\nand the crafting of Check 21 legislation.\nA secure and smooth-functioning payments system is a critical component of\neconomic growth and stability. Recognizing this, the Federal Reserve has sought to\npromote its “integrity and efficiency … and to ensure the provision of payment services\nto all depository institutions on an equitable basis … in an atmosphere of competitive\n\n4\n\n\ffairness.”1\nThe Federal Reserve’s dual role as an operator and regulator in the U.S. payments\nsystem is often viewed as unique relative to approaches in other countries. Throughout\nU.S. history, consumers, merchants, financial institutions, policymakers and others have\ngrappled with the question of who is ultimately responsible for what congressional\nleaders in 1913 called the “highways of commerce.” From the chaos of the early 19th\ncentury through today’s digital transactions, there has been a spirited debate over the\ncentral bank’s roles and responsibilities.2\nToday’s active participation in a range of activities positions the Federal Reserve\nto bring perspective and insight to the challenges and emerging issues affecting the\npayments landscape. While some public authorities in other countries have acted based\non explicit mandates, the Federal Reserve has leveraged the experience of its existing\ncentral bank roles to serve as a catalyst for critical improvement to the payments systems.\nIn this role, we have facilitated the important work of the more than 300 individuals\ninvolved in the Task Force. And, as is noted in the strategies paper, the Federal Reserve\nremains committed to serving as a leader, convener and catalyst as appropriate to foster a\nwell-functioning payments system for the public.\nI very much look forward to continuing our work with the industry to shape the\nnecessary improvements in our payments system that support confidence, economic\ngrowth and global competitiveness going forward.\n\n1\n\nThe Federal Reserve in the Payments System, revised 1990\nSee: Medley, Bill.

The implications of those choices are far-reaching not only to the Main Streets of this\ncountry but also to economies around the world. Central bank monetary policies loom large\namong those policy choices.\nOver the past 15 months, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has begun the\nprocess of gradually removing nearly a decade of monetary accommodation. That\naccommodation came in the form of both conventional interest rate policy, which lowered shortterm rates to near zero, and a series of more unconventional policy actions – namely, large-scale\nasset purchases and forward guidance. The actions were both lauded and criticized. Indeed, in\nMarch 2009, one member of the FOMC commented on the very difficult situation of determining\nan appropriate policy response at that time, noting “we’re in a position where doing the right\nthing is not obvious.”1\nIf doing “the right thing” was not obvious at that time, then the path to unwinding these\nextraordinary policy actions and returning to more conventional policy approaches is no less\nfraught with questions about the FOMC’s decision-making framework. How will conventional\nand unconventional policy accommodation be removed and what are the implications? Is the\nprocess of normalizing policy “behind the curve?” What linkages exist between balance sheet\nadjustments and interest rates? What level of interest rates best supports long-run price stability?\nMy remarks today will not attempt to answer many of these important questions. Instead,\nI will focus on the process of policy normalization and its challenges, particularly as it relates to\nunwinding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. I’ll begin with the economic backdrop under\nwhich the FOMC is considering these policy adjustments.\n1\n\nDonald Kohn, FOMC meeting transcript, March 17‐18, 2009.\n\n1\n\n\fTEXT EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 AM EASTERN TIME, TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 2017\n\nThe views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by other participants on\nthe FOMC.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\nFor the most part, the economy looks to be on solid footing. Consumers are confident and\nthey are spending, household balance sheets are in better shape, and house prices are rising.\nEmployment has gained traction, bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.5 percent. Business\ninvestment and productivity growth have been somewhat sluggish for most of the recovery, but\nprofitability has again increased. The energy and manufacturing sectors also are bouncing back\nwith the stabilization in oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar. In general,\nthe economy has come a very long way since the financial crisis that began nearly a decade ago\nand has weathered a number of shocks over the course of this lengthy expansion.\nDespite the apparent health of the economy, risks are always on the horizon. Today,\nhowever, there is a sense that outcomes could actually be better than expected, rather than worse.\nFor example, in the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, more participants now\nsee risks that real GDP growth and inflation could be higher than forecast, rather than lower.\nThis shift in risk assessment is in sharp contrast to the more pessimistic views that dominated\npast projections. Such an outlook has allowed the FOMC to continue the process of\nnormalization.\n\nUnwinding the Balance Sheet\nPrior to the financial crisis, the business of setting monetary policy involved few moving\nparts. FOMC decisions could be steered with a fair amount of precision by the Federal Reserve’s\n\n2\n\n\fTEXT EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 AM EASTERN TIME, TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 2017\n\nOpen Market Desk and with a relatively modest amount of intervention in financial markets.\nThere were other aspects to the process, but the tools and considerations were generally well\nunderstood and relatively straightforward.\nToday, conducting monetary policy is considerably more complicated, owing in part to\nthe size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Prior to the financial crisis and\nrecession, the Fed’s balance sheet was slightly less than $1 trillion with a portfolio of short-term\nTreasuries. Over the period from 2009 to 2014, a series of large-scale asset purchases swelled the\nbalance sheet to nearly $4.5 trillion, and the portfolio shifted to include mortgage-backed\nsecurities and long-term Treasuries.\nThese unprecedented actions were carefully considered with a desire to boost economic\nactivity. Faced with the prospect of potential nearer-term benefits, the associated costs were\ngenerally difficult to quantify and viewed to be well into the future, perhaps making them easier\nto discount. As a voting member who dissented in 2013, I believed these costs outweighed the\nbenefits at that time.\nThe key challenge for monetary policy today is to unwind this large balance sheet in the\nleast disruptive manner. It is an important step and one that the FOMC anticipated going back to\nJune 2011 when exit strategy principles were initially framed. Following decisions to expand the\nbalance sheet further, the FOMC revisited the exit strategy principles in 2014 and outlined its\napproach to monetary policy normalization in September of that year.\nIt is difficult to know with a high degree of confidence just how the economy and\nfinancial markets will react once the FOMC announces and then takes steps to reduce the size of\nits securities holdings. Some believe that the benefits of the actions that swelled the balance sheet\nwere modest, and as a result, the costs of its unwinding also could be of little consequence to the\n\n3\n\n\fTEXT EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 AM EASTERN TIME, TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 2017\n\nbroader economy. Others believe that the effects on the economy were substantial and that\nactions to reduce its size need to be taken with a great deal of care and caution. Of course, it is\nalso possible that any benefits gained from the balance sheet expansion won’t reverse when it\nshrinks. While evidence from a variety of sources and studies will inform decisions about\npossible effects and how to proceed, the implications for the economy are uncertain.\nIn addition, balance sheet actions have the potential to complicate interest rate policy.\nThere is likely some tradeoff between adjusting interest rates and shrinking the balance sheet, but\nthe specifics of the tradeoff are hard to quantify. This uncertainty and additional complexity\nraises the risk of a policy error or could spark a bout of financial market volatility.\nBeyond the mechanics of shrinking a large balance sheet, establishing a sound framework\nfor the timing of balance sheet adjustments will be important. To that end, the FOMC discussed\nat its most recent meeting in March various aspects of an appropriate decision-making\nframework to guide its actions.\nBalance sheet adjustments will need to be gradual and smooth, which is an approach that\ncarries the least risk in terms of a strategy to normalize its size. Importantly, once the process\nbegins, it should continue without reconsideration at each subsequent FOMC meeting. In other\nwords, the process should be on autopilot and not necessarily vary with moderate movements in\nthe economic data. To do otherwise would amount to using the balance sheet as an active tool of\npolicy outside of periods of severe financial or economic stress, and would increase uncertainty\nrather than reduce it.\n\n4\n\n\fTEXT EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 AM EASTERN TIME, TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 2017\n\nAvoiding Monetary “Fine Tuning”\nBased on economic conditions, I would support beginning the process of reducing the\nbalance sheet this year. This would further normalize the stance of policy and leave more highly\nliquid, safe securities available to the market. I do not favor prolonging action for the purpose of\nallowing inflation to overshoot the 2 percent goal or to press labor markets into a condition\nwhere they are overheating.\nAt the time the FOMC adopted the 2 percent inflation target in 2012, the unfamiliar\nnature and unknown consequences of large scale asset purchases had piqued concerns about the\nimplications for inflation expectations. Anchoring these expectations with a more explicit\ncommitment to price stability was appropriate. I supported that decision. In the years following,\nhowever, inflation ran below the stated target – although at times only slightly below – and only\nrecently has it moved above the target to 2.1 percent.\nIn its annual Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the FOMC\ntalks about the nature of its inflation objective. Specifically, inflation that persistently deviates\nabove or below the 2 percent objective would be cause for concern, but monetary policy need not\nreact to temporary deviations. Importantly, I do not interpret the strategy as calling for inflation\nto linger above 2 percent to make up for past shortfalls, but rather for inflation to move toward 2\npercent in the long run without any deliberate overshooting. Continuing highly accommodative\npolicy or adjusting monetary policy in response to modest shortfalls or overshoots from the\ninflation goal is an attempt at monetary fine tuning that is often not practical and may ultimately\nprove costly.\nAlthough inflation is running close to 2 percent today and is expected to remain there, the\nprices of different goods and services rise at very different rates. For example, services inflation\n\n5\n\n\fTEXT EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 AM EASTERN TIME, TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 2017\n\nhas been running well above 2 percent, and housing rents in particular have been playing a key\nrole in moving inflation higher. By several measures, rents are rising faster than aggregate\nwages. Keeping monetary policy easy to achieve higher inflation has the potential to push rents\nstill higher, negatively affecting a large percentage of households. Consequently, I am not as\nenthusiastic or encouraged as some when I see inflation moving higher, especially when it has\nbeen driven by a sector like housing. Inflation is a tax and those least able to afford it generally\nsuffer the most.\nSuch concentration and persistently rising prices in one area suggests the economy is\nstruggling to reallocate resources. For housing, it could reflect several factors such as tight\nlending standards faced by home builders and scarcity of skilled craftsmen needed to construct\nhomes. I expect the market to eventually solve for, or at least adapt to, such factors. Using\nmonetary policy however to compensate for them could easily end up hurting the population the\npolicy is intended to help.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, I am encouraged by the start of the normalization process and want to see it\ncontinue. Resisting the temptation to react to near-term fluctuations in the data will be necessary.\nLooking ahead, we should expect inflation to move up and down around 2 percent. A modest\ndecline in inflation or an overshoot may not necessarily warrant the monetary policy\nnormalization process to slow or accelerate. Such attempts at monetary fine-tuning can easily\nbackfire, so a more forward looking view of inflation is needed. This is not uncommon and it is\nwhy many economists and policymakers emphasize the importance of inflation expectations. In\n\n6\n\n\fTEXT EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 AM EASTERN TIME, TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 2017\n\nfact, the FOMC also has long-emphasized their importance, typically with specific mention in\neach FOMC statement.\nThe important factor is that the public, markets, and policymakers see the setting for\nmonetary policy supporting the 2 percent inflation goal in the long run, rather than expect a\npolicy that tries to keep inflation squarely pinned at 2 percent under all circumstances.\nWhile both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are in range to meet the FOMC’s\nobjectives, the federal funds rate is far from its longer-run level and the balance sheet remains\nlarge with reinvestment of maturing securities. Continuing along the path of normalization even\nin the face of uncertainty is necessary to achieving long-run objectives for the economy,\nincluding price stability and full employment on a sustained basis.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Hoenig.\nThe IFRS tangible leverage ratio for U.S. GSIBs was 6.28 percent at the end of 2016, up from\n5.75 percent at mid-year 2016. Their average price-to-book ratio increased from a discount to\nbook of 0.90 percent to a premium of 1.29 percent (column 12) over the past six months.\n“The data show that by any number of measures, the benefits of higher capital outweigh the\ncosts1,” Vice Chairman Hoenig said. “Global banks with stronger capital as measured under the\nleverage ratio and with fewer problem assets generally trade at a premium or at less of a discount\nto book value than banks with weaker capital2. Better capitalized banks lend more and do so on a\nsustained basis over the business cycle3, and they are less likely to fail or require bailouts4. As\ncapital levels have increased since 2009, loans have increased by $2.1 trillion, or 4 percent a year\non average, and bank earnings have continuously improved5. In other words, capital does not\nremain idle. Along with debt, capital is a primary source of funding for lending. As tangible\nequity grows from retained earnings, lending and earnings continue to grow.”\nWhile the largest banks continue to improve their tangible capital relative to assets, they remain\namong the most highly leveraged, providing the lowest returns on equity among U.S. industries,\nas illustrated in the attached chart. “Other major U.S. industries operate with higher equity\ncapital ratios, yet they produce a higher return on equity than the banking sector6.

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nApril 6, 2017\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York Community Banking Conference\nNew York, N.Y.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fCommunity banks have an important connection with the Federal Reserve. Across the 12\nFederal Reserve Banks, some 68 bankers serve as directors on either Reserve Bank or Branch\nboards and nearly all of them are community bankers. These individuals bring important\nperspectives to our work. I appreciate their contributions as well as the core function that\ncommunity banks serve in thousands of communities across the United States.\nI hope you’ll indulge me as I briefly preface my remarks this morning with some\npersonal history. Yesterday marked a milestone for me: 35 years of service with the Federal\nReserve. When I came to work for the Kansas City Fed as a bank examiner in 1982, I was also a\nfirst-time homeowner. I was delighted to have a job that would help me pay my bills, especially\nmy mortgage. At that time, I thought I’d made a steal to have assumed an existing mortgage at\nthe low rate of 12 percent.\nWorking at the Fed, I soon came to appreciate that it was a particularly challenging year\nfor the banking industry. Our region was hard hit by the trifecta of downturns in commercial real\nestate, energy and agriculture. That year, the failure of a small bank in Oklahoma triggered the\nfailure and eventual government bailout of one of the largest banks in the U.S. Meanwhile,\nhundreds of banks failed in the Tenth District. This was the environment in which I was trained\nto be a bank supervisor.\nThis also was the year that a former New York Fed president, Gerald Corrigan, wrote an\nessay titled “Are Banks Special?”1 It proved to be a foundational piece that has been\noccasionally revisited by others in the 35 years since. Today, I would like to return to the theme\nof Mr. Corrigan’s essay by looking at the role of banks while asking a slightly different question,\n“Do traditional banks still matter to the U.S. economy?” A spoiler alert: My answer is a\n\n1\n\nE. Gerald Corrigan served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1980 to 1984 and\npresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1985 to 1993.\n\n2\n\n\fdefinitive “yes.” I’ll use the remainder of my time today outlining why this is so, and why I\nbelieve this key component of the U.S. economy may be at risk.\nBefore going further, I should note that my comments today are my views only and not\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or its Board of Governors.\n\nThe Banking Landscape in 1982\nIn an interview some years later, Mr. Corrigan recalled the reason he wrote the 1982\nessay. Simply put, the competitive position of traditional banks was rapidly eroding, and\npolicymakers were contemplating the implications.\nIn the early 1980s, the combination of high interest rates and deposit rate ceilings made it\ndifficult for banks to compete with alternatives that were not subject to the same restrictions,\nincluding savings and loan NOW accounts and money market mutual funds. By the time interest\nrate ceilings were eliminated on most deposits, money market funds were well established.\nIn credit markets, the seeds of greater capital market competition for bank loans were\nalso planted in the early 1980s. The development of government and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities were followed by private label mortgage and other asset-backed securities. Another\nmajor innovation was funding new credits with high-yield bonds, which previously had been\nused only to refinance companies whose debt had been downgraded below investment grade.\nGiven the dramatic nature of these changes, questions arose about whether the role of\nbanks had been diminished. Would these new nonbank entrants supplant their role? Did it\nmatter?\nWith reflection on these questions, Mr. Corrigan concluded that banks were different and\nunique in three ways:\n\n3\n\n\f\n\nOnly banks offered transaction deposits payable on demand at par and readily\ntransferable;\n\n\n\nBanks served as the primary and ultimate source of liquidity for all other classes and\nsizes of institutions, both financial and nonfinancial;\n\n\n\nBanks served as the transmission mechanism for monetary policy which, combined\nwith operating the payments mechanism, facilitates efficient markets and orderly end\nof day settlement – a particularly important role in periods of financial stress.\n\nAt that time, these special characteristics of banks had three important implications for\nthe structure of our financial system and its regulation:\n\n\nNo other type of financial company had its funding protected by the public safety net\nof federal deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve discount window.\n\n\n\nBanks were regulated and supervised because of this safety net and their key role in\nthe economy. At that time, the separation of commercial banking from investment\nbanking and commerce was an important part of the prudential regulatory structure.\n\n\n\nOnly banks had direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payments rails.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1999, the financial system continued to evolve, aided by regulatory\ninterpretation and court decisions. And the banking industry began to experience rapid\nconsolidation. Much of the consolidation reflected mergers of smaller banks as intrastate and\ninterstate restrictions were relaxed. However, the most significant effect for the banking system\nwas an increase in the market share of the largest banks, driven by their efforts to create\nnationwide operations and enhance global competitiveness. During this period, the market share\nof the ten largest banking companies increased from 28 percent to 51 percent of total banking\nassets.\n\n4\n\n\fThe scale of these firms made it profitable to operate securities dealing and underwriting\nsubsidiaries under the Glass-Steagall Act’s Section 20 authority. This was the first major crack in\nthe wall between commercial and investment banking. In 1999, Glass-Steagall gave way to the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which invited bank holding companies to adopt investment\nbanking activities with important safety net advantages.\nWith the addition of these nonbanking activities, the 10 largest banking organizations\nsaw their market share rise further to 55 percent in 2007. Meanwhile, the composition of their\nassets changed dramatically. The average portfolio share of nonbanking assets rose from only 13\npercent in 1997 to 25 percent in 2007.\nThis summer marks the tenth anniversary of the financial crisis. That event brought to\nlight what had previously only been conceptually understood: the largest banking organizations\nwere highly interconnected and indeed too big to fail (TBTF). The safety net designed to cover\nonly commercial banking activities was stretched well beyond the insured depository\nsubsidiaries to their parent companies and nonbanking subsidiaries. However, only commercial\nbanks truly retained the unique characteristics that Mr. Corrigan argued made them special.\nAs a practical matter, the largest banks were the only firms that could acquire other large\nand troubled investment banks, commercial banks, and savings associations. The remaining large\nindependent investment banks became bank holding companies. As a result, the 10 largest\nbanking organizations now account for 67 percent of industry assets, while the average\nnonbanking-asset share of their portfolios has climbed to 29 percent.\nAs I look through the lens of the past 35 years, the financial system landscape has\ncertainly changed. There are three features that I find particularly striking over this period.\n\n5\n\n\f\n\nBanking system assets as a share of financial system assets have fallen from 37 to 19\npercent.\n\n\n\nThe number of banks has significantly declined from more than 18,000 to around\n5,000, largely reflected in fewer community banks with less than $100 million of\nassets.\n\n\n\nCommunity banks’ market share fell from 45 percent in 1982 to just 13 percent today.\n\nWhat has emerged within the banking system are two very different kinds of commercial\nbanking firms: a small number of very large banking organizations with significant nonbanking\nactivities and sufficient scale to pose systemic risk to the economy, and thousands of traditional\nbanks generally referred to as community banks.\n\nDo Traditional Banks Matter to the U.S. Economy in 2017?\nDespite such monumental shifts in the financial system landscape, one could reach the\nsame conclusion today as Mr. Corrigan did in 1982. Namely, that the banking system retains a\nunique role in our economy. Banks are still the only type of financial firm that can provide\nliquidity whenever needed, ensure payments are readily transferable, and aid the implementation\nof monetary policy.\nYet, the differences between the largest banks and community banks are significant and\nthose differences pose important challenges for setting effective regulatory policy. This leads me\nto ask a slightly different question than Mr. Corrigan asked: Are traditional banks, or\ncommunity banks, still important to the U.S. economy in 2017?\nI answered this question affirmatively at the beginning of my remarks. Indeed,\ntraditional banks are essential to thousands of communities across the country. In contrast to the\n\n6\n\n\flargest banks, community banks still rely primarily on relationship lending, with a focus on\nfunding local loans with core deposits. Their heterogeneous customer base and credit decisions\ninclude not only quantitative but qualitative aspects including judgments about the repayment\nability of their Main Street customers. These bankers serve on the boards of local schools,\nhospitals and other civic organizations, providing a key source of leadership in the community.\nThey serve their communities and are part of their communities.\nBut do they matter to the U.S. economy as a whole? Can online banking and scale satisfy\nthe credit needs on Main Streets and in rural areas? I am reminded that although we often refer\nto “the U.S. economy” in aggregate, as though it were a single monolithic entity, there are in fact\nthousands of micro-economies that taken together make up the $19 trillion U.S. economy. In\nthese micro-economies, community banks are a critical source of financing for small businesses,\nincluding startups. While community banks account for just 13 percent of industry assets, they\nare responsible for some 40 percent of bank lending to small businesses. In turn, small\nbusinesses with less than 500 employees account for about 50 percent of U.S. private\nemployment.2 Moreover, recent research shows that small startups with 20 to 499 employees\nplay a large role in net job creation that continues for up to five years after their formation. 3\nThis evidence indicates community banks are still extremely important to our economy,\nalthough, their competitive position is under stress. Market forces of technology and innovation\nare everywhere and community banks will need to be responsive to customer demand for new\nservices and methods of banking. But these are not the forces that particularly concern me. The\nrisk I see stems from a misaligned regulatory environment that poses a threat in my view to the\n\n2\n\n“United States Small Business Profile, 2016,” U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy.\nSee Robert Jay Dilger, “Small Business Administration and Job Creation,” Congressional Research Service,\nFebruary 8, 2017.\n3\n\n7\n\n\fdiversity of the U.S. banking system and healthy competition that has long served the country\nwell.\n\nPolicy Implications\nToday, the nation stands at a crossroads of policy choices. As policymakers consider\nregulatory reform, the special role of banks in our economy and particularly the role of\ncommunity banks, must factor into their decisions.\nWe witnessed the tremendous cost of a financial crisis. The regulatory response that\nfollowed was well intended and even justified in its aims to end TBTF and protect consumers.\nHowever, while the aim was specific to the largest banks, the regulatory net has ensnared\nthousands of community banks. Regulators have applied supervisory approaches and protections\nthat often fail to take into account the incentives and risk profile associated with relationship\nlending models of community banks.\nFor example, international capital standards, which formed the basis to reduce leverage in\nthe biggest banks, layer on unnecessary reporting requirements and complexity for banks that\nalready held high levels of capital. Appraisal standards aimed to ensure independent valuations\nsupport new loans create challenges for thousands of smaller banks that are portfolio lenders.\nThese small institutions, often located in more rural markets, struggle to find knowledgeable\nappraisers with sufficient comparable property sales to comply with the rules, and in some cases,\nconclude that qualified borrowers’ credit needs can’t be met.\nFinally, rules aimed at protecting consumers and other customers from unfair and\ndeceptive practices are important. However, long-term relationship lending also aligns the\nincentives that protect community bank customers. Unfortunately, the compliance burden for\n\n8\n\n\fcommunity banks introduces costly processes along with fear and confusion as they struggle to\napply narrow legal interpretations and opaque statistical models to the fair credit needs of their\nborrowers.\nUltimately, communities suffer when access to credit is unnecessarily limited, and so\ndoes the larger economy. Rules that aim to address the business models and incentives of the\nlargest banks may unintentionally put the diversity of the banking system at risk, and the lack of\nnew bank charters over the past decade suggests the barriers to entry may be high.\n\nConclusion\nThe regulatory remedy for today’s banking system will not be easily prescribed. But it\nwill need to recognize that the institutions we collectively refer to as “commercial banks” have\ndrifted apart over the past 35 years. At one end of the spectrum are banks that engage in global\nfinancing with systemic implications for failure and impact to the broader economy. At the other\nend are banks that engage in traditional lending and deposit-taking, whose impact on small\nbusiness and small communities translates to real economic outcomes.\nToday, the federal safety net supports both models and it is sagging, stretched by everlarger and more complex firms with significant nonbanking activities. Banking regulation must\ndo its best to offset the very real exposures for taxpayers and the risk to economic and financial\nstability. Nurturing incentives that reward success and punish failure are key. Aligning regulation\nthat effectively addresses risk at both ends of this spectrum will require that regulators either\nclose the gap between their differences or embrace the two models and attempt to apply very\ndifferent supervisory frameworks and approaches.\n\n9\n\n\fMarket forces will continue to reshape the industry as they have for the past 35 years and\nlonger. And community bankers are no strangers to those market forces or a challenging\noperating environment. But the banking industry has evolved in very different ways and rules\nthat inhibit market forces without offsetting gain warrant scrutiny.\nAs a highly concentrated banking system takes hold in the U.S., the issue of today’s\nbanking landscape poses a slightly different but important question about the ability of regulation\nto differentiate its aim. It will matter to thousands of communities served by you in the years\nahead, and by extension to the U.S. economy.\n\n10\n\n\f"

            "content": "“A Market-Based Proposal for Regulatory Relief and Accountability” -- Remarks by FDIC Vice\nChairman Thomas M. Hoenig, Presented to the Institute of International Bankers Annual\nWashington Conference, March 13, 2017\nIntroduction\nPromoting economic strength and sustainable growth is a common objective of nations around\nthe world, and the shape of the financial landscape in which this can best be achieved is rightly\nsubject to fierce debate. As we contemplate the paradigm here in the United States, we have two\ndistinct choices. One is to preserve the system that emerged from the most recent financial crisis.\nThe other is to reshape and reinvigorate the banking system by ending too-big-to-fail, enhancing\ncompetition, and rebuilding trust in our financial firms.\nAs memory of the financial crisis of 2008 fades, we must remain vigilant. We all know that this\nevent was not the only one of its kind. Indeed, the United States has experienced 14 major\nbanking crises dating back to 1837. I have been on the front line for at least three of them in the\n40-plus years that I have worked in bank supervision. While the reasons behind each crisis have\nbeen different, each has caused serious harm to individuals and the economy. It does not matter\nwhat politician or party is in office or whether new technology is put in place to better inform the\nindustry, banks will inevitably come under stress and some will fail—and a truly capitalistic\nsystem should allow them to do so. Rather than try to prevent bank failures, our goal should be to\nprevent the consequences of failures from requiring public bailouts and instead allow private\nowner equity to absorb the shocks.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted in response to\nthe most recent crisis. While well intended, its many and complicated regulations are\nburdensome for all banks, but especially smaller banks. The legislation also has served to\nenshrine too-big-to-fail for the largest, most complex universal banks, providing them with a\npowerful competitive advantage.\nToday I will outline an alternative approach to better address the challenge of too-big-to-fail,\nregulatory burden, and competitive equity. The proposal would not reduce the ability of a\nuniversal bank to conduct any of its current portfolio of activities, whatever they might be. It\nwould, however, partition nontraditional bank activities into separately managed and capitalized\naffiliates to return the safety net back to its original scope and purpose. The proposal also would\nrequire greater owner equity at risk for large, complex, universal banks, as defined in the\naccompanying term sheet. With these conditions in place, too-big-to-fail would be well on its\nway to being addressed, and a true opportunity for regulatory relief for these largest banks would\nbe provided. We could pare back the thousands of pages of rules that inhibit bank performance\nand level the competitive playing field without undermining the stability of our financial system\nand economy.\nA Proposal for Accountability and Regulatory Relief\n\n\fPartition Bank Activities and Preserve the Safety Net\nA major feature of this proposal is more effective use of the bank holding company business\nmodel. It would require large, complex, universal banks to separately capitalize and manage their\ntraditional commercial banking activities and their nontraditional activities, such as investment\nbanking.1 While this model allows for many of the synergies of commercial and investment bank\nactivities, it also serves to return the safety net to its original purpose—that of protecting the\npayments system and the depositor—and reduce the associated moral hazard.\nThis approach would also provide a far more competitive environment among investment\nbanking firms as they serve our economy. Over time, as the safety net has been allowed to cover\nexpanded activities conducted within commercial banks, the investment banking operations\naffiliated with insured banks gained a noticeable competitive advantage over noninsured\ncompetitors. Data show that for nonbank financial service providers, such as independent brokerdealers not affiliated with an insured bank, tangible equity measures 8 percent of assets, whereas\nmany nonbanks that are affiliated with an insured bank operate with substantially less capital\nmeasuring about 5 percent of assets.\nUnder this proposal, traditional banking activities generally found in an insured depository\ninstitution and nontraditional banking activities, such as investment banking, would each be\nstructured under one or more separately capitalized intermediate holding companies of a\nfinancial holding company (FHC). And each intermediate holding company that houses\nnontraditional banking activities would become a separate affiliate, separately capitalized and\nseparately managed from the insured bank. In addition, each intermediate holding company\nwould be structured in a manner that would make it a “resolvable” entity that could withstand the\nnormal bankruptcy process.\nCapitalization\nA nontraditional intermediate holding company would be capitalized using tracking shares\nissued by the ultimate parent. This is a relatively common practice used by commercial firms to\nseparate a key franchise in one operating division from new or riskier activities in another.\nTracking shares are generally a separate class of stock of the holding company that give\neconomic rights to a discrete set of assets—in this case the shares of the intermediate holding\ncompany. This would allow management to unlock value in each line of business while\ninsulating the insured depository institution from potential losses.\nResolvability\nThe nontraditional intermediate holding company would also be subject to independent liquidity\nrequirements designed to eliminate or limit access to the public safety net and to ensure that, if it\n1\n\nThis is similar in concept to John Vickers’s proposal adopted in the UK.\n\n\fwere to be fully separated from the financial holding company, it could continue to operate and\nfunction on its own in the market and be resolvable through normal bankruptcy. To protect the\ninsured bank, transactions with affiliates would be subject to stricter 23A and 23B requirements\nwhere, for example, quantitative limits would be tied to the capital stock and surplus of the\nmember banks as well as the capital stock and surplus of the intermediate holding companies.\nThe ultimate parent company and its affiliates should be constrained in the amount of debt\nfunding they provide to the nontraditional intermediate holding company. I would suggest a limit\nof 20 percent of aggregate liabilities, with external market sources providing 80 percent of the\nremaining debt funding.\nGovernance\nAs with any prudentially regulated entity, the ultimate responsibility for safety and soundness\nrests with the board of directors and senior management. To ensure that this responsibility is not\ncompromised and that accountability does not become fractured, internal oversight would need\nto be reformed so there is the appropriate separation of management across the affiliated entities\nand that an adequate control structure is established and maintained. Each intermediate holding\ncompany would have its own board of directors. And each financial holding company would be\nrequired to have an independent general internal auditor responsible for the audit function of the\ncompany in its entirety and who reports directly to the board of directors. In addition,\nmanagement would no longer be allowed to serve on the boards of directors.\nTangible Equity and Leverage Ratio\nNo proposal to strengthen the system and provide for relief from the burdens of regulation can\noccur without first bringing capital to levels that the market would otherwise demand if there\nwere no safety net.2 For the largest, most complex banks, as defined in the accompanying term\nsheet, my proposal would require, over time, a minimum capital level of 10 percent tangible\nequity to assets (recognizing only payment netting for derivatives). As I have suggested\nelsewhere, such a level of capital provides a deeper industry buffer against the contagious panic\nthat causes systemic failure when any one large banking firm fails, making bankruptcy more\nfeasible.\n\n2\n\nAfter nine years since the most recent crisis, taxpayers -- not the market -- continue to carry the burden of the\nultimate risk of loss, and yet taxpayers receive no dividend for their capital-at-risk. Using a 10 percent tangible\nequity at risk target and considering banks’ current level of tangible equity, I have estimated that the public’s\ninvestment in the top 10 U.S. bank holding companies and their insured depository institutions is equivalent to more\nthan $400 billion.\n\n\fWhile my proposal would set the level of capital for the insured bank, the level for nontraditional\nintermediate holding companies and the entities housed underneath it could be further examined\nand calibrated. For example, the capital requirements for an intermediate holding company\nhousing broker-dealer activities would become sized based on the market’s expectations and\nperception of risk as access to the public safety net would be confined. However, in setting the\nminimum requirement, it should not be less than what broker-dealers not affiliated with banks\ncurrently hold.3\nAs you know better than anyone, there is significant opposition to raising capital especially for\nthe large, complex, universal banks. Primary arguments are that doing so would hamper lending\nand that current capital requirements are already too burdensome and have been a drag on the\neconomy. These assertions are incorrect. Data show that a higher level of tangible equity in\nbanks does not curtail lending, but promotes it.4 Capital does not remain idle. Along with debt,\ncapital is a primary source of funding for lending. As tangible equity grows from retained\nearnings, lending and earnings continue to grow. As capital levels have increased since 2009,\nalbeit too little, loans have increased by $2.1 trillion, or 4 percent a year on average, and bank\nearnings have continuously improved.5 Further, studies document that insured banks with higher\nlevels of tangible equity are more likely to lend through economic cycles, including a downturn,\nwhich helps sustain economic growth over the long term.6\nThe consequences of inadequate capital are equally well documented. If you recall, in 2008 the\nlargest banks held tangible equity capital to assets of only 3 percent on average. Even with a\ntaxpayer bailout, they experienced losses equal to 6 percent of their assets. Today tangible\nequity among the largest firms is approximately 5.75 percent of tangible assets7. While this is an\nimprovement, it continues to fall short of covering losses similar to 2008. If the solvency of one\n\n3\n\nOne form could be the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio and another simpler and more direct form would be to\nrecognize only payment netting for derivatives (as contemplated by IFRS). I prefer this approach because it more\ntruly reflects the risks inherent in derivatives activities that cannot be offset or netted away.\n4\n\nShin, Hyun Song, “Bank Capital and Monetary Policy Transmission,” panel remarks at the ECB and Its Watchers\nXVII conference, Frankfurt, April 7, 2016, http://www.bis.org/speeches/sp160407.pdf.\n5\n\nFederal Reserve Y-9C data\n\n6\n\nPogach, Jonathan, “Literature Review on the Macroeconomic Impacts of Capital Requirements,” FDIC,\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/2016-05-12-lr.pdf.\n7\n\n8\n\nSemi-Annual Update of the Global Capital Index: https://fdic.gov/news/news/speeches/spsep2016.html\n\nThe scope of application does not apply to banking organizations in which the primary business purpose is to\nprovide custodial services. However, I also suggest that closer examination be undertaken to tailor the proposal to\ncustody banks to fit their business model accordingly.\n\n\fof these banks is called into question, the contagion of panic will follow. These firms remain too\nbig to fail.8\nTransition\nImplementation of the approach I am proposing contemplates a three-year period to restructure\nand separate the nontraditional banking activities and a multi-year period to meet enhanced\ncapital requirements.9 These periods could be subject to change after further examination, with\nthe primary goal of ensuring that services to the economy are not disrupted and credit\nintermediation is continuous.\nSustaining Investment Banking for the Long Term\nThis proposal recognizes that investment banking is an essential element of the economic\nsuccess of the United States, and its intent is to buttress this success. Through the booming 20th\ncentury and during the era of Glass-Steagall, investment banks underwrote companies that\nhelped to build the modern economy and became part of the national fabric. Such companies\nprovided jobs and security to millions of Americans and were a genuine source of national pride.\nToday that tradition continues with much needed capital and funding integral to startups like\nFacebook, Netflix, and Uber, companies that many couldn’t imagine living without and that are\ntruly indicative of American entrepreneurship in the 21st century. The proposal outlined here\nacknowledges the vast changes the financial industry is experiencing. These recommendations\nwill foster the business of investment banking and promote entrepreneurship, but also will\nprovide a more level competitive playing field among and between commercial and investment\nbanks, and they will do so without harmfully expanding the federal safety net and the moral\nhazard it sometimes invites.\nRegulatory Relief for FHCs Engaged in Nontraditional Banking Activities\nIf the banking industry were to structure itself as I have outlined, and with sufficient tangible\nequity at risk, then the opportunity for a significant reduction of regulatory requirements would\nbecome possible; much more than the 2-for-1 called for by the new Administration. All banks—\nincluding the largest, most complex, universal banks—could be relieved of the costs and burdens\nof risk-based capital and liquidity requirements. Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST), the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), Title II and Living Wills, and other\nrequirements mandated under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act could be simplified or\neliminated.\nMoreover, banks would get relief from the Volcker Rule. It would not be eliminated, but the\nburdens of it would be dramatically reduced. Speculative proprietary trading would still be\n\n\fprohibited, but through the use of trader mandates rather than through the complexities of the\ncurrent rule. An insured bank would be prohibited from owning or sponsoring a private equity or\nhedge fund, but the separately managed and capitalized affiliates would be able to do so with\nproper controls in place and assurances that the safety net was appropriately confined and risk\nadequately capitalized.\nRegulatory Relief for Traditional Banks\nThis proposal for nontraditional banks could be adopted separately or in tandem with the\nregulatory relief proposal for traditional banks that I announced in April 2015.10 The community\nand regional banks that qualify under that framework would continue to do so.\nConclusion\nRegulatory relief for the banking industry is a goal worth pursuing. This is especially the case for\nregional and community banks saddled with burdensome and complex rules disproportionate to\ntheir simpler traditional business model. Regulatory relief for the largest firms is also needed,\nalthough their circumstances are more complex. They engage in a much broader set of activities\nthan traditional banks. They rely on extreme leverage to fund themselves when compared with\nmost other banks and nonfinancial companies. Over time they have come to control a\ndisproportionate share of the nation’s banking and financial assets and as a result have become\ntoo-big-to-fail. Dodd-Frank legislation, with its many and more complicated regulations, was\nenacted to address this problem, but it imposes a heavy cost burden on the industry and its results\nhave been mixed at best.\nWe need regulatory reforms, but they must be grounded in capitalism that permits failure and\nimproves economic efficiency and growth while maintaining the safety and soundness of the\neconomic and financial system overall. We can best achieve these goals if the largest banks were\nto partition their commercial and investment banking activities and also hold tangible equity\ncapital at a level where bank owners—not the taxpayer—cover the cost of inevitable failures.\n###\n\nThomas M.

Hoenig\nMarch 13, 2017\nI.\n\nPURPOSE. To ensure that the public safety net is not expanded beyond the traditional banking\nactivities that it was originally designed to support and to restore open market competition within the\nfinancial services industry. Traditional and nontraditional banking activities inside a Financial\nHolding Company (FHC) organization structure should be legally separated and capitalized1, similar\nto the UK approach championed by John Vickers.\n\nII.\n\nSCOPE OF APPLICATION. This term sheet would apply to banking organizations with one or\nmore entities that are either:\na. Registered as a broker-dealer, an investment adviser, a securities-based swaps dealer, or a\nmajor securities-based swaps participant with the SEC;\nb. Registered as a futures commission merchant, a commodity pool operator, a swaps dealer, or\na major swaps participant with the CFTC;\nc. An Edge Act or Agreement Corporation;\nd. A merchant banking entity or a financial subsidiary controlled by one or more insured\ndepository institutions;\ne. A sponsor or manager of hedge funds, private equity funds, or securitizations the underlying\nassets of which are not loans (other than SBICs or Community Reinvestment Act vehicles);\nf.\n\nAn insurance underwriter (including reinsurance); or\n\ng. An entity that provides similar services.\nIII. EXCLUSIONS FROM SCOPE OF APPLICATION. This term sheet would not apply to banking\norganizations that do not fall within the Scope of Application as defined above, or that would fall\nwithin the Scope of Application but for which the primary business purpose is to provide custodial\nservices (Custody Banks).\nIV. EXCLUSION FROM SCOPE FOR TRADITIONAL BANKS. For all other banking\norganizations (other than Custody Banks), please see the term sheet for Traditional Bank Regulatory\n1\n\nThere are a few banking organizations that engage in these activities, but which do not\ncurrently have a holding company. This term sheet should be read to apply to these\norganizations by imposing a requirement to establish a holding company structure that would\ncontain separate IHCs.\n\n\fRelief originally proposed in April 20152. Generally a traditional bank would be eligible for\nregulatory relief if:\na. It holds no trading assets or liabilities (other than permissible derivatives);\nb. It holds no derivative positions other than interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives;\nc. The total notional value of all its derivatives exposures - including cleared and non-cleared\nderivatives - is less than $8 billion; and\nd. It maintains a ratio of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles equity-to-assets of at least\n10%.\nV.\n\nSEPARATION OF TRADITIONAL AND NONTRADITIONAL BANKING ACTIVITIES.\nTraditional banking activities (TBA) would be allowed access to the current federal safety net but\nnontraditional banking activities (NTBA) would not have direct access and only limited, indirect\naccess.\na. TBA would be limited to the “business of banking” (as traditionally conceived) but a\ndiscussion of TBAs would be necessary to ensure that appropriate depository, credit\nintermediation and payment systems services are conducted. In no case should TBA include\nactivities associated with insurance underwriting, securities or swaps; and as such, should not\ninclude underwriting, market making, broker-dealer, futures commissions merchant (FCM),\ninvestment advisory, asset management, investment company, hedge fund/private equity\ninvestment, or swaps dealing activities;\nb. Both TBA and NTBA affiliates would be structured underneath one or more separately\ncapitalized intermediate holding companies of an FHC;\nc. TBA would be conducted in the bank intermediate holding company (BIHC) and NTBA\nwould be conducted in the nontraditional intermediate holding company (NIHC);\nd. The BIHC would be the holding company for an insured depository institution and its\nsubsidiaries;\ne. The NIHC would be the holding company for all entities and affiliates conducting NTBA,\nincluding broker dealer, FCM, swap activities and all other non-traditional banking activities.\nAll Edge Act and Agreement Corporations and their subsidiaries would be included in an\nNIHC.\n\nVI. Nontraditional Intermediate Holding Company. Each NIHC would be a separate affiliate,\nwhich is separately managed and capitalized.\n\n2\n\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/relief.html\n\n\fa. Each NIHC structure should be established in a manner deemed by the FHC board of\ndirectors to be a “resolvable entity”; that is, the entity could be resolved through the\nbankruptcy process;\nb. Each NIHC would be capitalized in the form of tracking shares issued by the FHC, which\nperfectly track to gains/losses and other economics of the NIHC;\nc. Each NIHC would be subject to independent liquidity requirements designed to (1) limit or\neliminate access to the public safety net and (2) to ensure that in the event the NIHC were to\nbe separated from the FHC it could continue to function as an operational entity;\nd. No more than [20%] of the debt of NIHC’s liabilities and debt would be held in aggregate by\nthe FHC and any other affiliates;\ne. The NIHC would be prohibited from engaging in speculative proprietary trading that would\nbe controlled through trader mandates rather than the complicated measures of the Volcker\nRule;\nf.\n\nEach NIHC would be subject to a modified 23A/23B arrangement where the quantitative\nlimits on transactions with affiliates is applied to the capital stock and surplus of the member\nbanks as well as the capital stock and surplus of the NIHC affiliate.\n\nVII. Bank Intermediate Holding Company. Each BIHC would be a separate affiliate, which is\nseparately managed and capitalized.\na. The risk mitigating hedging requirements of the Volcker Rule, along with its prohibitions\nrelated to hedge fund/private equity investments would continue in force;\nb. All other activities covered by the Volcker Rule would be considered NTBA, such as market\nmaking and underwriting.\nVIII. Governance. Internal oversight would need to be reformed to ensure appropriate separation of\nmanagement and to ensure an adequate internal control structure.\na. Management would not be allowed to serve on the Board of Directors;\nb. An Independent “General Internal Auditor” (GIA) position would be required for each FHC;\ni. The incumbent in this position would report directly and exclusively to the Board of\nDirectors.\nii. The GIA would be in charge of the independent audit function of the FHC and all\naffiliates and would oversee the external audit of the firm.\niii. To ensure complete independence, the GIA should be prohibited from serving in any\ncapacity at the FHC, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, for a period of 5 years following\nthe end of his/her employment.\n\n\fc. External auditors would be prohibited from providing any service other than traditional\nauditing services (e.g. no consulting or other “value-added” services) and must rotate at least\nevery 5 years.\nIX. Capital Reforms. The leverage ratio would be the primary measure of capital adequacy for\nregulatory purposes.\na. A 10% leverage ratio would be required at each BIHC and at each IDI subsidiary of a BIHC\nas well as any standalone IDIs;\nb. A [10%] leverage ratio would be required at each NIHC;\nc. A [10%] leverage ratio would be required at the FHC;\nd. The leverage ratio requirements should be designed to ensure that all risks are generally\ncaptured: credit, operational, market, concentration, liquidity, interest rate, off-balance sheet\nand other risks;\ni. As such, the leverage ratio should be appropriately expansive to incorporate the\ncredit, counterparty and payment/liquidity risks associated with derivatives and other\nso-called level 2 and level 3 assets.\nii. One form could be the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio and another simpler and\nmore direct form would be to recognize only payment netting for derivatives (as\ncontemplated by IFRS).\nX.\n\nRegulatory Relief. The structure described above and the leverage capitalization of the various\nentities should eliminate the need for many of the complex regulations under the Dodd Frank Act\nsuch as:\na. The comprehensive capital analysis and review (CCAR) exercise;\nb. Dodd Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST);\nc. Regulatory risk-based capital (as a primary measure of capital adequacy);\nd. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR);\ne. Title II and living wills; and\nf.\n\nOther enhanced requirements under section 165 of the DFA.\n\nXI. Prompt Corrective Action. PCA will need to be revised to:\na. Eliminate risk-based capital and to incorporate recognition of the higher Leverage Ratio\nrequirements; and\nb. Enhanced to include measures of deterioration in asset quality (such as the “Texas Ratio”).\nXII. Supervisory Expectations. Determinations of safety and soundness will include:\n\n\fa. Internally calculated risk-based capital calculations and liquidity measurements should be a\nnon-publically disclosed component of the supervisory assessment of safety and soundness;\nb. Internal stress testing practices would remain as a management and supervisory tool;\nhowever, stress testing scenarios and assumptions should be designed by the banking\norganization (subject to board and supervisor approval) and should be commensurate with its\nown business model and risks rather than being developed by the agencies as a one-size fits\nall approach;\nc. Supervisors will assess the adequacy and soundness of planned capital distributions; and\nd. FHCs should be able to demonstrate that they have internally allocated their equity to absorb\nlosses that could emanate from any risks.\nXIII. Regulatory Oversight. There would be no change to the current structure of the prudential\nbanking agencies or market regulatory agencies.\na. The primary regulator of the FHC, BIHC and NIHC would be the Federal Reserve;\nb. Insured depository institutions subsidiaries of the BIHC would continue to be regulated based\non charter affiliation;\nc. Market regulators (SEC and/or CFTC) would oversee the subsidiaries of the NIHC.\nXIV. Transition Periods. An appropriate period of time would be provided to allow for a gradual\ntransition to ensure continued delivery of financial services to the economy.\na. Structural transitions should occur over a period not to exceed [3] years;\nb. Capital requirements should be transitioned in over a period not to exceed [5] years.\n\n\f\f\f\f\f\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFebruary 28, 2017\nStanford Institute for Economic Policy Research\nStanford, Calif.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you. It is a pleasure to join you today, and I am especially delighted that Mylan\nGray, deputy chair of the Associated Students of Stanford University, is here this evening. Mylan\nis a Kansas Citian and an alum of the Kansas City Fed’s Student Board of Directors program.\nFor the past two summers he has worked at the Bank as a “camp counselor” at our Summer at\nthe Fed student program. That program introduces young students to banking, the economy and\npersonal finance. Last year, Mylan was the program’s activities director.\nThe mission of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research is an important one.\nEconomic analysis and policy research offers a critical foundation for policy deliberations. As a\nparticipant on the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), our decision\nmaking and policy judgments depend heavily on quality analysis to set a long-run course for\nmonetary policy, particularly when uncertainty dominates the landscape.\nIn my remarks this evening, I’ll offer my view on the U.S. economy and will talk a bit\nabout some of the challenges we have faced in the post-crisis environment. I’ll also share my\nthoughts on what I believe to be the most appropriate action for policy moving forward. As\nalways, the views I express here are my own and are not necessarily shared by others on the\nFOMC.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\nThis month (Feb. 2017) marks the 92nd consecutive month of the economic expansion in\nthe United States, which is the third-longest U.S. expansion on record going back to about 1850.\nSince the end of the financial crisis, the economy has grown annually by about 2 percent each\nyear. Unemployment has declined and labor markets appear to have only modest, if any,\nremaining slack. Inflation has been running at rates consistent with price stability and near the\n\n1\n\n\fFOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Of course, there are always some areas of concern\nin the economy, but as a whole, things look fairly positive.\nOptimism has increased during the past few months, as measured in both business and\nconsumer surveys. While consumer spending is expected to continue at a healthy pace, this rise\nin confidence may not automatically lead to even stronger consumer spending. The evidence\nsuggests that consumer confidence is not always a useful predictor of future consumption\ngrowth, especially once other factors such as interest rates or income growth are taken into\naccount. Still, household balance sheets are in much better shape compared to the years\nimmediately following the financial crisis and the labor market has been performing well, so the\noutlook remains positive for consumer spending.\nLooking at labor markets, we’re essentially at or near full employment. The\nunemployment rate now sits at 4.8 percent, just below what I view as its longer-run value of\nabout 5 percent. Labor force participation, which had been trending downwards for most of the\nexpansion, has leveled off and even slightly increased over the past year. This recent rise appears\nto be due to a decline in labor force exits rather than an increase in labor force entry. In other\nwords, individuals are not more likely to return to the labor force right now, but workers are\nstaying on the job a bit longer. These factors suggest that there is not a lot of labor force slack,\neither among the officially unemployed or those out of the labor force who might rejoin.\nOf course, there are numerous indicators on the labor market, so trying to judge the\namount of slack is not a straightforward task. One approach we use at the Kansas City Fed is a\nLabor Market Conditions Index, which was developed by my staff. It summarizes a wide array\nof labor market data into two succinct statistics: the level of labor market activity and the\nmomentum of that activity. The most recent reading for January showed a level of activity that\n\n2\n\n\fwas above the long-term average, and a momentum indicator that was the highest level since the\nseries began in 1992.\nAnother important indicator of slack in the labor market is wage growth, which has been\nquite moderate since the financial crisis, though has increased over the past year. Despite the\nimprovement in overall wage growth, there are differences across sectors. Recent research by my\nstaff shows that the increase in wages has been driven by only a few industry segments – namely,\nthe construction, manufacturing and wholesale sectors. Growth in hours worked in these sectors\nhas been moderating, even as wages rise, perhaps suggesting firms are having an increasingly\ndifficult time attracting new workers. On the other hand, wage growth has shown few signs of\nacceleration in many of the service sectors, although growth in hours worked has been steadily\nincreasing. This suggests there may have been a modest amount of slack in some service sectors,\nbut as economic growth continues, workers will likely become increasingly scarce. This “bottom\nup” approach to evaluating the labor market suggests further wage pressure is likely to follow\nacross a broader range of industries.\nAs labor markets continue to improve and economic activity expands, we could see a bit\nmore inflationary pressure. Currently the FOMC’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has increased by 1.6 percent over the last 12\nmonths. This measure has risen notably, compared to about 0.6 percent a year ago, as the effects\nof lower oil prices have waned. Looking past these oil price effects, the core measure of inflation\nis up 1.7 percent over the past year.\nOther measures of inflation show similar trends. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is up\n2.5 percent over the past year, the Dallas Fed’s trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate over the past\n\n3\n\n\fyear is up 1.9 percent and the Cleveland Fed’s weighted median CPI is up 2.5 percent. All these\nmeasures point in the same direction: Inflation remains low, but is rising.\n\nThe Role of Monetary Policy Rules\nThe current state of the economy stands in sharp contrast to earlier phases of the\nrecovery. Following the crisis, the unemployment rate was persistently above its longer-run\nnormal level and inflation below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal. At the risk of\noversimplifying, central banks generally respond with monetary accommodation to support\neconomic activity and achieve their mandated objectives in these conditions. That is, the\nstandard approach is to lower interest rates.\nWhile the policy prescription in such circumstances is generally straightforward, a few\ncomplications come into play. The first is that monetary policy operates with lags, which is a\npoint highlighted in the FOMC’s annual “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy.” The timing and extent of any lags are imprecisely measured and can vary over time.\nImportantly, these lags require monetary policy to act in a forward-looking manner. That is,\npolicymakers cannot wait to take action until they see full employment and inflation at 2 percent.\nPolicy needs to be adjusted in advance. Second, following the crisis, policymakers have become\nfar more attuned to the importance of fostering financial stability. While the relationship between\nmonetary policy and financial stability is not entirely clear, events and research strongly suggest\nthat risk-taking often increases in low-rate environments. Indeed, the motivation for\nunconventional policies such as large-scale asset purchases was aimed at providing additional\nstimulus at the zero lower bound by encouraging risk-taking, creating wealth effects, and\nboosting asset prices. And third, policy needs to be set with a sense of the risks surrounding the\n\n4\n\n\feconomic outlook. Foreign developments or financial market volatility are examples of issues\nthat might cause policymakers to temporarily adjust course. Judging the scope and impact of\nsuch risks is always challenging, but this caution carries certain costs. Postponing rate\nadjustments is not unreasonable in the face of near-term risks, but can keep policy stuck in place.\nThe resulting delay can leave a lasting imprint on the stance of monetary policy, especially if\nadjustments are not made after the risk passes.\nPolicymakers must deal with such complications. Among the tools available to us are\nmonetary policy rules, commonly known as Taylor rules. These rules provide guidelines for how\nto calibrate interest rates under most economic conditions. How the FOMC should use such rules\nhas been the focus of some recent public discussion. In fact, the FOMC does consult the\nguidance coming from monetary policy rules at each of its meetings. Rules come in many\nflavors, depending on what variables are included, the weights attached to the different variables,\nand the designated value of the longer-run level of the funds rate. All of these make choosing a\nsingle rule difficult, but that’s not to say that they are not immensely useful. They may offer\ndifferent advice, but when all the advice moves in a particular direction, that is usually an\nimportant signal to policymakers.\nWhile a variety of rules exist, the intuition behind them is relatively straightforward.\nMost rules take into account how far inflation is from the FOMC’s price stability target, as well\nas how far the labor market is from full employment. The deviation from their longer-run levels\nis accounted for in the resulting rate prescription. When both numbers are close to their longerrun levels, these rules often prescribe that the federal funds rate should be near or be moving\ntoward its longer-run level. Indeed, most monetary policy rules today are pointing in the same\ngeneral direction and suggest short-term interest rates should be moving higher. Given these\n\n5\n\n\fsignals, it may be a bit surprising that the FOMC has only raised its policy rate target twice since\nthe end of the financial crisis.\n\nThe Path to the Longer-Run\nWhile these policy rules are prescribing higher short-term interest rates, the FOMC has\ndetermined that the path for raising rates will be a gradual one. Part of the reason for a gradual\napproach is risk management. Moving too quickly could potentially risk slowing economic\nactivity, which obviously would not be an objective of monetary policy given current growth and\ninflation rates. A more rapid increase in short-term rates also could pose risks to financial\nstability after an extended period of near zero rates.\nWhile I support this gradual approach, the current readings for inflation and\nunemployment relative to the FOMC’s mandated objectives argue for more than just one move\nper year, as has been the case over the previous two years. This pace has left the current stance of\npolicy more accommodative than advocated by most policy rules and the funds rate well below\nits longer-run level, a discrepancy I see as important to remedy in order to preserve longer-run\nprice stability and sustainable growth.\nIn considering the path to more normal interest rate settings, some have questioned\nwhether monetary policy is truly stimulative given that unusually low rates have not generated\nthe same kind of growth or inflation experienced in the past. One explanation is that certain\nfeatures of the economy may have changed, and that these changes are reflected in a measure\nknown as the natural rate of interest. For example, short-term interest rates adjusted for inflation\n– that is, real rates – have been negative for many years. When real rates are low, but the\neconomy is not growing rapidly, the implication is that the natural rate of interest is quite low.\n\n6\n\n\fAlthough not observable, movements in the natural rate are presumed to occur gradually,\nsuggesting current low levels will persist and result in a lower longer-run federal funds rate than\nin the past. The implication of a lower natural interest rate would mean that today’s monetary\npolicy settings, although low by historical standards, might not be as stimulative as policy rules\nsuggest.\nWhat would cause the economy to change in such a way? There are likely any number of\nreasons, but one that seems plausible is that productivity growth has not been as strong as it was\nin previous decades. Slower productivity growth, which has been an ongoing issue for the\neconomy for some time, means the supply side of the economy also is growing more slowly. As\na result, moderate economic growth may be sufficient to absorb slack and could even cause the\neconomy to outrun its potential. In fact, we see this today in some measures of what is called the\noutput gap, which captures the difference between the level of economic activity and what the\neconomy can produce at full employment. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco produces a measure of the output gap and natural rate. They show that 2 percent\ngrowth the past few years has actually been higher than the economy’s potential and in fact, the\namount of economic activity is currently above its potential level. These circumstances often\nlead to price pressures and higher inflation.\nPulling the pieces together, then, how should monetary policy respond in a setting with a\nlow natural rate of interest and slow productivity growth, but with the economy growing faster\nthan its potential? Again, we can glean insight from Taylor rules, which still would prescribe a\nhigher federal funds rate in the near-term to ensure economic activity does not too far exceed its\npotential capacity, but that rate might top out at a level below what we have seen in the past.\nThat is, the longer-run level of the funds rate could be lower than in previous decades.\n\n7\n\n\fThe case for a much lower natural rate of interest seems plausible to me, but it puts a\ngreat deal of weight on estimates that are subject to considerable uncertainty. History has shown\nthat deviating from long-run variables can increase risk to desired economic outcomes. My own\nview is that policy must still adjust from its current settings in order to “promote effectively the\ngoals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates” as\nspecified by the Federal Reserve Act. So while I see a gradual approach to raising rates as\nappropriate, I see more than one move per year, as has been the case, as needed to achieve the\nFOMC’s objectives.\n\nConclusion\nEconomic expansion over the past seven years has brought the labor market and inflation\nto levels consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run objectives. In this environment, policy rules\npoint to higher rates, and there is reason to believe they are fairly signaling. To be sure, the\noutlook for the economy does not call for tight policy by any means, but a gradual and deliberate\nmove to more normal rates is necessary to limit the risk of creating imbalances and financial\nstability risks that could surface in undesirable ways.\n\n8\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nNovember 18, 2016\nOil and the Economy: Adapting to a New Reality\nA Joint Conference of the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City\nHouston, Texas\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you. I am pleased to join Rob Kaplan for this conference co-sponsored by the\nDallas and Kansas City Federal Reserve Banks. The oil and gas sector features prominently in\nthe economies of our respective regions, making the focus of this conference “Adapting to a New\nReality” highly relevant to our work as policymakers.\nUnderstanding the dynamics of this market is critical. As such, we have long studied\ntrends in the sector and how they affect economic and banking conditions. As the shale boom\nintensified this decade, and the oil and gas industry grew to its largest share of regional economic\nactivity since the early 1980s, we have devoted more resources to understanding this important\naspect of the regional, national and global economy. Additionally, and importantly, we rely on\nbusiness contacts – nearly 80 percent of the energy companies in the Fortune 1000 are located in\nour two Federal Reserve Districts. Some of these companies are represented in our surveys,\nparticipate in roundtables and serve as directors on our boards of directors. This key input is\nessential to our understanding of the broader economy and an important contribution to our\npolicy deliberations.\nIn my remarks this morning, I’ll talk about how regional insight feeds into policymakers’\nunderstanding of the national economy. I’ll also offer my perspective on the outlook for the U.S.\neconomy and the current stance of monetary policy.\nThese are my views – not Rob’s, nor others within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInsights from Fed Regional Surveys\nThe Federal Reserve’s Beige Book provides the public and Fed policymakers with\nregional views on the economy eight times a year. In addition, as it pertains to energy, the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City conduct quarterly surveys of oil and gas firms\n\n1\n\n\fheadquartered in our Districts. The surveys gather information on current business activity,\ncapital spending plans, employment, price expectations, and other key indicators. The most\nrecent results, for the third quarter of 2016, were somewhat encouraging, showing an expansion\nof business activity and expectations for increased capital spending, but still slight reductions in\nemployment.\nA particularly useful piece of information has been the price of oil that firms tell us they\nneed to be profitable and also what prices they need to substantially increase drilling activity.\nWe’ve asked questions along these lines in the Kansas City survey since 2014. At that time, the\naverage price needed to be profitable was $79/barrel. Since then, with reductions in services\ncosts, as well as advancements in technology and productivity, firms’ average profitable price\nhas fallen by a third, to $53/barrel in third quarter 2016. That price is still slightly higher than\nrecently prevailing prices, but not considerably so. With the most recent range of profitable\nprices reported by firms ranging from $40 to $75/barrel, drilling is now profitable for some\ncompanies in some places, which is evident in the recent uptick in rig counts.\nBut what will it take to substantially increase drilling activity? The most recent\nresponses to the Kansas City Fed survey noted $64/barrel on average, and for the Dallas Fed\nsurvey it was $60/barrel, both well above recent oil prices, although some firms reported needing\nonly $50/barrel to sizably increase drilling. We also asked firms in the Kansas City District\nabout the prices needed to significantly increase natural gas drilling, and the results were\nsimilarly above current levels. Firms on average needed $3.65/mbtu, considerably higher than\nrecent prices, although some firms did say they could significantly increase drilling for as low as\n$3.00/mbtu. Taken together, these results suggest increased drilling activity is likely to be\nrelatively moderate until prices reach and sustain a higher level.\n\n2\n\n\fAnother key source of information about the energy sector comes from insights provided\ndirectly by oil and gas executives, as I mentioned earlier. Both Reserve Banks have energy\nexecutives on our Boards of Directors, several of whom are with us today. In addition to their\nbroad oversight of Reserve Bank operations, their specific knowledge of key aspects of the\nenergy sector, including the real activity and the financial perspective, provides us with greater\ninsights than we are able to gather from our surveys. We also regularly host individual meetings\nand roundtable discussions with oil and gas executives. Our ability to directly and immediately\ninteract with this important sector of the global economy is one example of the role regional\nFederal Reserve Banks play in monitoring current economic activity and understanding\nexpectations for future activity. This type of insight is an especially important contribution to the\nFederal Reserve’s policy deliberations and our understanding of the individual components that\ninfluence the broad economy.\n\nThe Energy Sector and Broader Economic Activity\nTurning to the broad economy, even though oil prices have risen from the lows we saw\nearlier this year, they are still considerably below their mid-2014 peak. Not surprisingly, given\nthe important role of the energy sector in this part of the country, the decline in oil prices had a\nnegative effect on economic activity from a regional perspective.\nWhat is surprising, though, is that the decline in oil prices did not provide a significant\nboost to the national economy. Although declining oil prices did support consumer spending and\nsectors that are heavily reliant on energy, some researchers have concluded these benefits may\nhave been offset by a reduction in investment and employment in the energy sector.\n\n3\n\n\fIn general, the positive and negative effects appear to be largely offsetting, which has\noften not been the case in years past. One obvious reason for the difference is that the size of the\nenergy sector has increased significantly, so a decline in activity is large enough today to be\nnotable on a national scale. In early 2014, the U.S. mining sector, comprised primarily of oil and\ngas, accounted for 2.8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), up from less than 1 percent\nin the late 1990s. By early 2016, it had shrunk by about half, to 1.2 percent of GDP. In terms of\nemployment, over 150,000 generally high-paying jobs have been lost in the U.S. oil and gas\nsector since the fall of 2014, a decline of nearly 30 percent. There also have been thousands of\nassociated job losses in manufacturing, transportation, and other related sectors in energyintensive areas of the country.\nOn the demand side, it is possible that the benefits from lower oil prices are now smaller.\nFor example, gasoline as a share of total consumption, has fallen from about 4 percent in 1986 to\nabout 2 ¼ percent in 2015. On net, today it does seem to be the case that the direct effects of oil\nprice swings are larger on the investment and employment side, but smaller on the consumer\nside.\nLooking forward, I continue to expect developments in the energy sector to affect the\neconomic outlook. If energy prices were to increase, then I would expect that new drilling\nactivities will expand, and the additional oil rigs will contribute to overall investment in\nstructures. While I now view business investment as being poised to make a modest contribution\nto growth over the medium-term, a potential retreat in energy prices poses a downside risk. This\ncould occur if the OPEC deal expected at the end of the month does not materialize.\nIn terms of oil prices, I currently see the potential for new drilling activities within the\nU.S., as well as the potential to bring idle wells back online, which would alter the path of oil\n\n4\n\n\fprices going forward. With a large amount of oil production ready to come online if prices were\nto advance through the mid-$50 range, I do not see as much room for price appreciation,\nespecially as global economic growth continues at a moderate pace. Among the anecdotes we’ve\nheard from directors and other executives this year is that there is a considerable amount of\n“money on the sidelines” looking to invest in oil and gas opportunities if prices continue to\nstabilize. This is despite some of the profitability concerns that I noted earlier, and may be\nreflective of a general “reach for yield” among investors, something we continue to monitor.\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook\nTurning to the national economic outlook, I continue to expect a moderate pace of\ngrowth, supported by consumer spending and stable business fixed investment. Consumers\ngenerally remain confident about the economy, and going forward, I expect continued job gains\nand increases in wages to support consumer spending. Overall, the labor market is near full\nemployment, and inflation is approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\nIndeed, over the past year we have seen a fast pace of growth in labor utilization that\nremoved a substantial amount of labor market slack. For example, the U.S. economy added more\nthan 3 million people to the labor force since last September, which is the fastest pace of growth\nsince the year 2000. The additional workers joining the labor force in the past 12 months were\naccompanied by payroll growth that averaged 200,000 jobs per month, so that total employment\nhas grown by about 2.5 million jobs on net. With strong growth in the labor force accompanied\nby rapid employment, the jobless rate has remained at 4.9 percent, near my assessment of its\nnatural rate.\n\n5\n\n\fAlthough labor utilization has grown rapidly during the last year, the rising labor force\nparticipation rate does not suggest that a previously untapped group of workers has been pulled\nin from the sidelines. In fact, since a year ago, the number of workers entering the labor force\neach month has remained flat, if not slightly lower. Also, the number of people leaving the labor\nforce each month has fallen substantially. For example, the trend in the number of workers\nexiting the labor force each month fell from 6.6 million to 6.2 million over the past year. These\ndevelopments indicate that workers are better attached to the labor force – that is, they appear\nless likely to get discouraged by spells of unemployment, and wage growth has encouraged them\nto remain active in the labor market.1 This attachment to the work force is a good sign.\nEven as labor markets have improved at a healthy pace, inflation has been restrained, in\npart reflecting the downturn in oil prices. Recently, these effects have begun to diminish. As oil\nprices stabilized, inflation has increased from 0.2 percent to 1.3 percent over the past year.\n\nMonetary Policy\nConsidering the rise in the labor force participation rate, increases in employment, and\nsigns of higher compensation, policymakers must judge what stance of monetary policy will\nsupport the substantial gains achieved in the last year and keep the economy near its maximum\nsustainable employment level. Interest rates have remained at historically low levels and the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has signaled a gradual path toward more normal\nsettings. At its most recent meeting, the FOMC statement noted that the case for an increase in\nthe federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for\nsome further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.\n\n1\n\nDidem Tuzemen and Jon Willis, “What is Behind the Recent Increase in Labor Force Participation?” Macro\nBulletin, Nov. 14, 2016.\n\n6\n\n\fAs a voting member of the Committee, I dissented in favor of a modest 25-basis point\nincrease. My view is that monetary policy should avoid deliberately stoking the risks that come\nwith overheating the U.S. economy and instead, slowly raise the federal funds rate to promote\nmaximum employment commensurate with the economy’s long-run potential to increase\nproduction.\nSupporting conditions that bring more people into the workforce is certainly a desirable\nobjective. However, over the last 55 years, there have been occasions where the unemployment\nrate has fallen below a level that is consistent with the maximum sustainable level of\nemployment. In these cases, the U.S. economy soon after faced a period of substantial and\nprolonged increases in unemployment. The effect of allowing the economy to overheat in these\ncases produced short-term gains, but ultimately with longer-term costs. Consequently, I see\nmoving sooner, rather than later, as taking into account the long and variable lags with which\nmonetary policy operates, and reduces the potential for “go-stop” types of policies that create\nvolatility, rather than subdue it.\n\nClosing\nDecisions about monetary policy, of course, ultimately depend on how the U.S. and\nglobal economies unfold. Understanding the effects of lower oil prices is critical in this regard,\nand I look forward to the important insights and perspectives to be explored at today’s\nconference.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "“The Long-Run Imperatives of Monetary Policy and Macro-Prudential Supervision” -- Remarks\nof FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig to the Cato Institute’s 34th Annual Monetary\nConference: Central Banks and Financial Turmoil\nNovember 17, 2016\n\nIntroduction\nAs central banks have come to dominate financial markets, the debate over their ability to deliver\nstrong, long-run economic growth has become increasingly intense. “Central Banks and\nFinancial Turmoil” is the theme of this conference, and given the dramatic expansion of central\nbank balance sheets and their influence over economies, it is a topic well worth our attention. I\ncongratulate the conference organizers for their foresight in selecting it.\nI will focus my remarks this morning on two areas on which central bank performance is judged:\nmonetary policy and macro-prudential supervision. While a host of factors determine an\neconomy’s strength, these two policy instruments have come to play a dominant role in our\neconomy, and their role going forward is a major subject of attention. I will suggest that\nmonetary and regulatory policies have for some time been overly focused on short-run effects at\nthe expense of long-run goals, which has unintentionally served to increase uncertainty and\neconomic fragility. Future success requires that policy move deliberately toward a more balanced\nlong-run objective.\nMonetary Policy\nThe dual mandate for U.S. monetary policy, established by Congress, is to “maintain long-run\ngrowth of the money and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long-run potential\nto increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable\nprices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”1 In reading this mandate, you might note the\nemphasis on long-run effects. As a colleague once described it, “central bankers should take\ncare of the long-run so that the short-run can take care of itself.”\nIn a world of discretionary policy, when the moment comes to choose between long-run goals\nand short-term effects, policymakers experience enormous pressure to choose the more expedient\nshort-run solution, deferring to another time concern with long-run implications.\nThis tendency can be seen in the long-run trends of short-term interest rates. Chart 1, for\nexample, shows the real fed funds rate from 1960 to August 2016. For comparison, the chart\nalso shows the average real GDP growth rate of near 3 percent for that period. It is noteworthy\nthat the real fed funds rate was below the average real GDP growth rate for nearly 80 percent of\nthe time, and it was negative for over 30 percent of the time. Also noteworthy, the real fed funds\nrate averaged only 0.9 percent from 1991 to 1995, 0.2 percent from 2001 to 2005, and minus 1\npercent or lower from 2008 through 2015. Regardless of what one deems the appropriate U.S.\n1\n\nFederal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended\n\n\fmonetary policy to be, it was -- except in the early 1980s -- decidedly directed toward lower\ninterest rates.\nRegulatory Policy and Macro-Prudential Supervision\nTurning to macro-prudential supervision, its objective might best be described as that of assuring\nthe integrity of financial institutions, sound markets, and a reliable payments and intermediation\nframework. Carrying out this mandate involves an extensive program of rules and supervisory\noversight designed to achieve long-run financial stability, credit availability, and stable economic\ngrowth.\nAs with monetary policy, authorities have discretion as to how they carry out the supervision\nmandate, which has led to different degrees of oversight over time. For much of the quarter\ncentury prior to 2008, for example, there was a systematic easing of constraints on bank activity\nand, most notably, an extension of the public safety net to an increasing number of non-bank\nfinancial activities conducted by both banks and shadow banks. Commercial banks were given\nauthority to engage in investment banking, trading, and broker-dealer activities, while investment\nbanks and other financial firms were permitted to engage in a host of bank-like activities.2\nWhile the safety net was broadened over this period, capital requirements were allowed to\nweaken, exacerbating the downward effects on stability.3 Chart 2 shows that from 2001 through\n2008, equity capital supporting the industry’s balance sheet – defined as the ratio of tangible\nequity-to-tangible assets – declined to less than 4 percent. This trend of lower capital continued a\ncentury-long shift in which market and public confidence in banks relied less on bank capital\nlevels and more on the growing presence of government safety nets.4\nLeveraging the Economic System\nChart 3 shows the longer-run effects of accommodative monetary and supervisory policies.\nTotal U.S. debt relative to nominal GDP rose from 265 percent in 2000 to 365 percent in 2008,\nand it has improved only slightly since then. Behind this broad trend, debt within sectors also has\nsubstantially increased. For example, gross federal debt increased from 39 percent to 51 percent\nof GDP, consumer debt increased from about 70 percent to almost 100 percent of GDP, nonfinancial debt increased from 63 percent to 74 percent, and U.S. debt extended to the rest of the\nworld increased from about 8 percent to 11 percent of GDP.\n\n2\n\nLaws such as the Glass-Steagall Act were repealed, which ended the separation of commercial banking from\ninvestment banking, broker-dealer activities and, in some cases, non-financial commercial firms. Bankruptcy law\nchanged to allow short-term liabilities to be secured with mortgages instead of short-term U.S. government\nsecurities. The SEC eased capital restraints for investment banks in 2004.\n3\nBetween 1993 and 2007, financial regulators allowed leverage at regulated firms to increase to unprecedented\nlevels. The average leverage – measured as total assets to tangible equity capital – of the 20 largest, most\nsystemically important U.S. financial institutions increased from 18 dollars of assets being funded by one dollar of\nequity, to a high of 31 dollars of assets being funded by that same dollar. This represents almost a doubling of debt\nused to fund assets.\n4\nFDIC calculations based on data from the FDIC and Cambridge University Press.\n\n\fThese trends in debt have been described by some as a consequence of a global savings glut.\nHowever, it is no coincidence that the trends followed nearly a decade of systematic and\nsometimes dramatic accommodative U.S. monetary policy and capital standards that encouraged\nhigher bank and financial leverage.\nFinally, Chart 4 shows that despite these ever-more accommodative monetary and regulatory\npolicies, and despite the increase in financial and economic leverage, the growth rate of the U.S.\neconomy has not increased. Indeed, real GDP growth during expansionary periods has declined\nsteadily from more than 4 percent annually in the 1980s to just over 2 percent today.\nFinancial Crisis\nThese trends suggest that the financial and economic shock experienced in 2008 did not just\nhappen randomly. It followed an extended period of accommodative policies in which long-run\nconsiderations were most often discounted against the perception of immediate needs. Extended\nperiods in which monetary policy catered to short-term growth objectives and regulatory policies\nencouraging ever-declining capital levels among financial firms made the system increasingly\nvulnerable to shocks.\nAs 2007 and 2008 unfolded, the effects of these policies erupted and losses quickly\noverwhelmed the financial industry. Chart 5 shows that cumulative losses and TARP capital\ninjections in 2008 approached nearly 6 percent of total industry assets. Several of the largest\nfinancial firms failed, requiring unprecedented government support to prevent collapse, while\nmany others appeared ripe for failure. The public and the market did the rational thing; they ran\nfor the exits. The crisis was on.\nCentral banks, using unprecedented facilities, injected enormous amounts of liquidity into the\neconomy. In an important sense, their actions represented a decisive execution of the lender and\nliquidity provider of last resort, which calmed fears and staunched the crisis. While it was the\nappropriate short-run response, its extended duration comes with a substantial public cost.\nPost Crisis: Monetary Policy and Discretion\nBy the third quarter of 2009, an economic recovery was underway. Then, as now, the month-tomonth data were mixed5 but the overall trend suggesting a sustained recovery was compelling.\nFor example, average GDP growth during the first year of recovery was 2.7 percent, which\ncompares favorably to the 2.9 percent growth rate in the first year following the 1991 recession\nand 2.3 percent growth following the 2001 recession.\nNevertheless, most policymakers were uncertain of the recovery’s durability and were loath to\nnormalize monetary policy regardless of the emerging favorable evidence. Long-run\n\n5\n\nFor example, industrial production ranged between a negative 0.4 percent in June to plus 1.1 percent in August,\nand durable goods orders varied from a strong 7.1 percent in July from a minus 3.2 percent in June. Private job\ngrowth continued to decline, but at a slower pace.\n\n\fconsiderations took a back seat to short-run concerns.6 In November of 2010, under the title\nQE2, the Federal Reserve voted to purchase $600 billion of Treasuries at a rate of $75 billion per\nmonth. Again between 2012 and October 2014 the Federal Reserve, under QE3, purchased $40\nbillion of MBS securities per month. Monetary policy throughout 2010 and beyond remained not\nonly accommodative, but also represented an unprecedented policy easing into a recovering\neconomy.\nAs a result, a fragile equilibrium dependent on low interest rates has settled so deeply into the\neconomy and financial markets that the difficulty of moving rates higher represents an unsettling\nforce within the United States and global economies.\nPost Crisis: Macro-Prudential Supervision\nAs monetary policy was steadily eased, concern arose regarding its negative long-term effects on\nfinancial firms and the broader economy. To offset these concerns, macro-prudential supervision\nwas touted in financial policy circles as a powerful force to balance any negative effects of\nmonetary policy.\nEnhanced macro-prudential financial rules and standards are tools that serve the goal of greater\nfinancial stability, but as a complement to monetary policy they raise their own set of issues. If\nmonetary policy is set to stimulate credit expansion and wealth effects, it is highly unlikely that\nbank supervisors would take actions that impede those policies.\nChart 6 shows the trend line for tangible capital-to-tangible assets for the largest U.S. banks\nsince 2012. This ratio increased from 3.66 percent in the second quarter of 2012 to 5.75 in the\nsecond quarter of 2016.7 Before 2008 it was argued that requiring increased capital would slow\neconomic growth. These arguments tended to win the day in policy circles, but do not hold up as\ndata and experience show8. Referring back to Chart 5, cumulative losses plus TARP capital\ninjections for the 26 largest U.S. banks in 2008 were nearly 6 percent of total assets. Thus,\nshould the largest firms experience losses in the future similar to those of 2008, those losses\nwould absorb nearly all of their reported tangible equity capital and would, again, place\nenormous stress on the financial system.\n\n6\n\nIn justifying the highly accommodative policies of 2010, the arguments echoed those used in the 2003 easing\nperiod, when the federal funds rate was lowered to 1 percent, and where it remained until 2004. For example, during\nthis earlier period, there were constant references among FOMC members to a risk of deflation and constant\nreminders of Japan's deflation. And although in the third quarter of 2003 real GDP in the U.S. expanded at an annual\nrate of nearly 7 percent, the policy rate still remained at 1 percent for nearly a year. The insistence on keeping rates\nlow set the stage for the speculative binge that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. Policymakers accepted the\nrisk of greater long-run financial instability for short-run gains.\n7\nGlobal Capital Index of capitalization ratios for global systemically important banks, second quarter 2016.\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/capitalizationratio2q16.pdf\n8\nGambacorta, Leonardo; Shin, Hyun Song; BIS Working Papers No. 558: Why Bank Capital Matters for Monetary\nPolicy, April 2016, https://www.bis.org/publ/work558.pdf\nPogach, Jonathan, \"Literature Review on the Macroeconomic Impacts of Capital Requirements,\" FDIC Division of\nInsurance and Research, https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/2016-05-12-lr.pdf\n\n\fWhile strengthening bank capital would serve the industry and the economy well, an effort is\nunderway to back away from this macro-prudential policy goal.9 The argument continues now,\nas it did pre-crisis, that increasing capital from current levels will hurt economic growth. To the\nextent that these arguments are successful, the industry and economy will be very poorly served.\nMacro-prudential supervision and monetary policy are not tools for fine-tuning the economy, but\nare blunt instruments generally managed toward the same policy goals. The mandate for these\npolicies is long-term stability, but too often the immediacy of the short term has taken\nprecedence. And the cost has been great.\nChanging the Approach\nAfter nearly a decade of highly accommodative monetary policy and uneven supervision, the\nU.S. economy is growing more slowly than policymakers had hoped for or expected when this\npolicy cycle began. While it prevented a financial collapse in 2008, subsequent easing failed to\ndeliver the expected economic growth and has left the system fragile. And allowing financial\nfirms to operate at minimum capital levels fails to accelerate economic growth and leaves the\nsystem more vulnerable to shock.\nThis accommodative policy loop must change. To normalize monetary policy, interest rates\nmust increase, which will temporarily put downward pressure on financial industry asset values\nand earnings. It is also understood, but less acknowledged, that if capital levels of the world’s\nlargest banks remain at current levels, these firms will continue to be vulnerable to losses that\nflow from higher rates and macro-economic adjustments. Such consequences could weaken\nbank balance sheets significantly and undermine their ability to support the economy through the\nadjustment period.\nThe challenge is to find a path that enables central banks to rebalance monetary policy without\nshock overwhelming the financial system and undermining long-run economic growth. One such\npath to consider is for interest rates to be increased in a clear, deliberate manner toward an\nannounced long-run target rate or range. The time line, adjustment path, and target range would\nbe influenced by a host of factors, including, for example, fiscal policy, demographics, and\ninternational events. However, once chosen and announced, the policy must not be abandoned at\nthe first – or even second – sign of stress. It took a decade to get to this point, and it will take\ntime to return to “normal”.\nImportantly, there should be no backing away from insisting on strong equity capital standards.\nCapital should be set to levels that ensure the industry can absorb future losses and reduce\nconcerns about its resilience. This requires building tangible equity capital beyond current levels.\nWhile challenging, there is clearly room to strengthen capital through retained earnings. For\nexample, since 2009, the largest eight US banks have paid out $243 billion of the $431 billion\n9\n\nGovernors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) statement “The GHOS endorsed the broad direction of the\nCommittee's reforms. The GHOS discussed the Basel Committee's ongoing cumulative impact assessment and\nreaffirmed that, as a result of this assessment, the Committee should focus on not significantly increasing overall\ncapital requirements.” Bank for International Settlements, Press Release, September 11, 2016.\nhttp://www.bis.org/press/p160911.htm\n\n\fearned. The industry, therefore, has the capacity to systematically strengthen capital and build\nindustry resiliency through retained earnings.\nImportantly also, retained earnings would not be stale reserves, as is sometimes suggested.\nRetained earnings are working capital that facilitates bank lending, enhances bank earnings,\npromotes financial stability, and supports long-term economic growth. While concern has been\nexpressed in some quarters that requiring increased equity would lower returns to investors and\nraise the cost of capital, there is ample evidence that well-capitalized banks trade at higher\npremiums than less well-capitalized banks and have a lower cost of capital over time. History\nalso shows that without the government safety net, the market would insist on banks having\ntangible capital levels – in other words, owner equity -- higher than currently maintained. And,\nas a matter of public policy, we should not allow the benefits of the government safety net,\nwhich are meant to protect the public, to flow as a subsidy to private investors.\nIn summary, I am suggesting that both monetary and macro-prudential policies need to focus\nindependently on the long run. Interest rates need to normalize, and bank capital needs to be\nstrengthened. Policy cannot stay on its current path of low-for-long rates and return-to-lower\ncapital without undermining the resilience of the financial system and the economy, and without\ninviting harsher future adjustments, as occurred in past episodes when policy was highly\naccommodative. We have an opportunity to strengthen banks, the financial system, and the\neconomy to achieve real long-run growth goals, if the view of policymakers shifts from short-run\neffect to long-term sustainability.\n###\nThe views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of the FDIC.\nThomas M.

            "content": "\"Strengthening Global Capital\nAn Opportunity Not To Be Lost\"\nRemarks by\nFDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig\nTo the\n22nd Annual Risk USA Conference,\nNew York, NY\nNovember 9, 2016\nIntroduction\nBasel III is scheduled to be finalized by year-end and presented to top regulators and\ncentral bankers for approval in early 2017. The original goals of the six-year-long effort\nwere to \"reduce the complexity of the regulatory framework and improve comparability\"\nand \"address excessive variability in the capital requirements for credit risk.\"1 These\ngoals are laudable.\nUnfortunately, as memory of the 2008 financial crisis has waned, the exercise has\nadded a third objective: ensuring that the final calibration of the Basel III framework not\nsignificantly increase overall capital requirements.2 Should this occur, it would truly\nrepresent an opportunity lost. Instead of strengthening the foundation of the global\nfinancial system, as was intended with the original goals, Basel III would legitimize the\ninadequate status quo and undermine the long-run objective of real financial stability.\nIn my remarks today I will discuss key factors that are at the core of the on-going debate\nover what defines adequate capital. First, I will discuss the controversy over alternative\nmeasurements for judging adequate capital. Simply stated, most measurements are too\ncomplicated, set too low, and often vary by jurisdiction in ways that weaken global\nfinancial stability. Second, relying only on public information, I will note changes that the\nBasel Committee appears to be considering that will weaken current standards and why\nthese changes are ill-advised. Third, I will reiterate my concerns regarding Total LossAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) and its use as a means to justify lower levels of capital and\nrequire firms to issue more debt.\nCapital Adequacy\nCapital levels are reported as a ratio, with equity capital amounts in the numerator and\nsome measure of a firm's assets in the denominator. The simplest measure of capital, a\nleverage ratio, uses accounting equity (adjusted to remove intangible assets) and\naccounting assets. For decades, however, the Basel Committee has preferred a riskbased capital ratio, which uses a regulatory measure of capital and assets. Under this\nframework, regulators allowed certain debt instruments, with minimal equity-like\ncharacteristics, to be folded into the numerator, and for assets to be discounted by everlower risk weights in the denominator. These adjustments encouraged increased\nleverage among firms and were often amplified in certain jurisdictions.\n\n\fDuring the 2008 financial crisis, markets quickly turned away from measuring bank\nstability with risk-based ratios and by necessity adopted the leverage ratio for its greater\nreliability and comparability across banks and jurisdictions. Adjusting leverage ratios to\nput firms on the same accounting standard quickly showed that while banks' risk-based\ncapital ratios were often roughly equal, their leverage ratios often varied widely.\nToday, the average leverage ratio for the world's largest banks is around 5.5 percent.3\nThis average conceals significant outliers in certain jurisdictions that have leverage\nratios at pre-crisis levels of less than 4 percent, while they report risk-based capital\nratios on par with the world’s strongest banks. Such inconsistency serves to undermine\nmarket confidence and financial stability, and is what the Basel Committee originally\nsought to fix.\nOne bank's recent and widely publicized experience serves to demonstrate the effects\nof such inconsistent standards. Its tier 1 risk-based capital ratio measured 14 percent,\nwhile its leverage ratio was 2.68 percent. It became evident that markets viewed the\nleverage ratio as the more credible measure of the bank's capital position, as\ncounterparties fled at the first sign of trouble.4 For these reasons, the Basel Committee\nshould not promise that there will be no significant increase in industry capital levels,\nand it would be a further mistake to enshrine such capital standards with a regulatory\nstamp of approval.\nThe last financial crisis exposed significant weaknesses in the Basel capital framework.\nRisk-based capital did a poor job controlling management's risk appetite. It\nmisrepresented to the public the level of risk in banks and the industry. It resulted in\nlarge misallocations of capital, of which a significant amount was distributed, leaving\nbanks ill-prepared and inadequately capitalized to absorb losses. For regulators to\nignore these lessons and begin to recalibrate and weaken the Basel III framework\nbefore it is even fully implemented is counterintuitive and counterproductive.\nThe proposed recalibration of Basel III is especially disconcerting given that since\n2008–2009 the largest banks have grown significantly in size and importance, and\nremain highly complicated and highly leveraged. These conditions underscore the\ndangers to the broader economy of having too little capital to absorb future losses when\nthey inevitably arise. Looking back, for example, the amount of losses and the amount\nof TARP assistance that U.S. banks took in 2008 equaled nearly 6 percent of assets.\nThis means that if a systemically important U.S. bank incurred similar losses today, its\ntangible capital would be gone. In response, market confidence would be shaken, which\ncould trigger fears of destabilized firms despite the presence of the Basel III framework.\nIn Europe, where tangible capital ratios are even lower, this level of loss would be\ncatastrophic.\nWhile progress has been made in strengthening the capital positions of some of the\nlargest banking organizations, the numbers show that \"improvement\" is not the same as\n\"adequate.\" Thus, it is disappointing that some are suggesting that now is not the time\nto raise capital further. The issue has even taken on a political tone, as some assert that\n\n\fimproving capital would be detrimental to the fragile global economy. However, easing\nrequirements for banks that are running on razor-thin levels of capital is not the answer,\nand allowing banks to distribute substantial amounts of capital through dividends and\nstock buybacks,5 as they have since the 2008–2009 financial crisis, does not\nstrengthen economies. Banks would better serve the goal of stable long-term economic\ngrowth with well-capitalized and stronger balance sheets.\nI would add, as I have elsewhere, that it is a fallacy to say that increased levels of equity\ncapital in banks undermine their ability to lend and take risks, which becomes a drag on\neconomic growth. More accurately, research shows that undercapitalized banks when\nunder stress curtail lending, because they hold excessive debt against too little equity to\nabsorb losses. Having higher levels of tangible equity funding assets versus debt goes\na long way in mitigating a \"credit crunch.\"6 Thus, holding banks to higher standards of\ncapital, judged through the leverage ratio, provides for the best long-run finance and\neconomic outcomes.\nRedesign and Recalibration\nDespite these findings, the recent push for capital neutrality persists and has become a\npolitical mandate pressing regulators to weaken the leverage and risk-weighted\nstandards under the rubric of recalibration. The United States should not follow this path\nnor allow its capital mandates to be compromised in this fashion.\nIt is no secret that I have long been a critic of the well-intentioned but impossible task of\nforecasting and assigning risk-weights to assets. A risk-based system is inherently\nineffective for judging a bank's loss-absorbing capacity because management tends to\nunderreport risks and maximize leverage in an effort to boost short-run returns.\nFollowing the lessons of the crisis, these risk-based standards are now being\nimplemented in conjunction with the leverage ratio as a counterweight to these\nweaknesses. Regulatory authorities would be remiss in their obligations to the long-run\ninterest of the public and the financial system if they do not ensure that the leverage\nratio remains strong and uncompromised.\nThese lessons, in fact, suggest that the leverage ratio should be the benchmark for\njudging bank capital strength. It is less susceptible to management manipulation and\nassumes no special regulatory clairvoyance regarding bank risk. It represents a\nfundamental stock of non-borrowed funds that is available to absorb losses regardless\nof the source of such loss. It does not discern among losses that flow from credits,\noperations, fraudulent activities, publicly announced legal penalties, or any other risk\nregardless of whether it is captured in the risk-weighted measure.\nTherefore, the idea of recalibrating the leverage ratio should be fully rejected if it\nintroduces a risk-based component that would undermine these very advantages and\nweaken the leverage ratio’s usefulness. Proposed changes to the leverage ratio include,\nfor example, exempting central bank placements7 from the risk-weighted measure and\nallowing initial margin to be recognized as an offset to exposure.8 Either of these\n\n\fproposals, if adopted, would reduce the capital required to maintain a minimum\nleverage ratio and the funds available to absorb losses. A justification for such\nproposals is to facilitate monetary policy and to incentivize derivatives clearing.\nHowever, there is no evidence that suggests such actions would promote these goals\non a sustained basis.\nAdjustments to Basel’s risk-weighted capital measures are also being proposed, not to\ncapture risk but to assure capital neutrality. Modifications to risk weights under\nconsideration include lower weights for residential mortgages, although they were at the\ncenter of the last financial crisis. Other proposals would eliminate or reduce capital\ncharges for operational risk.9 Ironically, these proposed changes come at a time when\nthe largest banks continue to carry troubled assets, have experienced significant\noperational losses, and are exposed to elevated cyber-security risks.\nConfusing matters further, adjustments are being considered for risk-modeled\napproaches with the goal of lowering input floors. This goes against Basel’s original\nintent to constrain this practice for measuring credit risk in the loan and investment\nportfolios and adjust for the weaknesses that inherently underlie models. The mere fact\nthat risk-based approaches must always be constrained and negotiated by regulators—\nthrough the complex processes of flooring inputs and outputs, for example—only\nunderscores the necessity of a simple, robust, and uncompromised leverage ratio.\nTo be sure, risk-based analysis can be an important management tool for the internal\nmeasurement and allocation of economic capital and for stress-testing bank\nperformance. However, this use of risk-based measures does not justify it serving as a\nsupervisory tool for determining loss absorbency. Such use has proven repeatedly to be\nunreliable.\nRegulatory risk-based standards by their very nature are lagging measures, designed\nand calibrated based on each previous crisis. They involve parameters that are fiercely\nnegotiated for years and subject to the political climate of the times, as we are\nwitnessing first hand in Basel today. The Basel Committee’s current mandate to achieve\ncapital neutrality requires adjustments unrelated to safety and soundness. To what end?\nIt is not designed to capture actual risk inherent in the assets subject to weighting, but\nrather to ensure that capital requirements for the industry remain unchanged. This\npolicy approach does nothing to improve the stability of the global financial system; it\nonly weakens it.\nTLAC and Long-Term Debt Requirements\nIntertwined in the discussion of capital adequacy and financial stability is Total LossAbsorbing Capacity. TLAC requires large, interconnected banking firms to hold certain\nlevels of long-term debt to improve their resolvability should they fail. The goal is\nlaudable, but as I have noted elsewhere, it is fraught with problems. An added long-term\ndebt requirement places earnings demands on the banking system and could be\ncounterproductive, especially during a period of financial stress. Those familiar with\n\n\fTLAC and its requirements fully understand that as firms issue large amounts of\nadditional, and more expensive, long-term debt— increasing their leverage— they must\nearn commensurately higher returns to meet debt service and avoid default.\nIt is paradoxical to suggest that the best way to manage the effects of excess leverage\nand financial vulnerability is to layer on even more leverage, potentially raising financial\nvulnerability. For example, in a recession if earnings become insufficient to make\nholding company debt payments, the resources to meet the obligations would likely\ncome out of the bank to avoid default. Unlike dividends, these payments cannot be\nsuspended without dire consequences, and thus they undermine an operating bank's\nability to retain earnings for its own capital needs following a downturn in the economy.\nThis can only undermine financial stability and economic growth.\nFurthermore, TLAC has other destabilizing features. Because it is debt, buyers can—\nand often do—get insurance on potential default through the CDS market. This\nincreases the level of interconnectedness in the financial system and amplifies the risk\nof contagion.\nThe acceptance of TLAC as a capital replacement is untested, and there is no\nassurance that the level of debt required would be sufficient to avoid panic by both the\ndebt and equity holders during a time of financial stress. This is no time for unsound\nexperiments.\nConclusion\nMomentum is developing within the Basel Committee to undermine measures that could\nincrease bank capital levels, and some jurisdictions are threatening to walk away if the\nmeasures are thought too strict. The United States should avoid joining this race to the\nbottom. The benefits of stronger capital levels are evidenced in U.S. firms that have\nhigher price-to-book ratios and that are viewed as the counterparty of choice among\nmarket participants.\nFinally, while I have always been critical of the Basel risk-based capital framework, it\ndoes remain a principle tool in judging capital adequacy and, therefore, Basel III should\nbe strengthened not compromised. Strengthening the framework, until recently, has\nbeen the common objective of global regulators as they increased the overall quality\nand quantity of capital within the risk weighted measure. In addition they increased\nreliance on the leverage ratio for judging the overall soundness of balance sheets. This\nsturdier framework will be significantly compromised if proposed changes to the\nleverage ratio and to Basel III are adopted. This short-term focus of the industry has\nbeen made a political mandate, but as regulators we are obligated to do better than\nthat.\n###\nThe views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of the FDIC.\n\n\fThomas M.

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 12, 2016\nThe Chicago Payments Symposium\nChicago, Ill.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fGood morning. I am pleased to be with you today to discuss the work of our\npayments coalition to improve the speed, efficiency and security of the U.S. payment\nsystem.\nWhen we began this work nearly two years ago, we understood it would be\nchallenging. We set forth ambitious outcomes that called for a new and different\nenvironment in which payments could be made on mobile platforms, on any day, in real\ntime, and with the certainty that the highest level of security would protect both the\nsender and the recipient in the transaction. We also understood the need to act\ndeliberately, but on an aggressive schedule, because we saw countries around the world\nmoving swiftly to develop their own real-time payments infrastructure.\nToday, I would like to spend some time updating you on the progress of this\nwork. I’ll discuss the approach we have taken to facilitate this activity and provide some\ndetail about the work being done by both our Faster Payments and Secure Payments Task\nForces. I’ll conclude with a few thoughts on where their efforts are headed and what to\nexpect in the year ahead, including some of the challenges we will face.\n\nThe Case for Faster Payments in the United States\nThe U.S. payment system effectively supports the largest economy in the world,\nand has a long history of evolving to meet changing needs. In early 2015, the Federal\nReserve issued a call to action in the form of a paper, titled Strategies for Improving the\nU.S Payment System, that outlined the collective thinking of U.S. payment system\nstakeholders and the Federal Reserve on ways to improve the system.\n\n1\n\n\fThe vision set out in the paper framed specific strategies designed to meet the\ngrowing demands of American consumers and businesses that continue to shift their daily\ntransactions toward e-commerce and Internet-enabled technologies. The strategies are\nbased on five desired outcomes for improvements in the following areas: speed, security,\nefficiency, cross-border payments and industry collaboration. We also committed to\nmake improvements to the payment services provided by the Federal Reserve.\nAs the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve is uniquely\npositioned to facilitate the stakeholder collaboration needed to provide widespread access\nand the adoption of new payment system capabilities. For at least the last 50 years,\nmutual cooperation on payment issues between the Federal Reserve and the private sector\nhave contributed to a more resilient payment system, yielding significant benefits to the\npublic and the economy as a whole.\nTo be sure, this approach has had its detractors, including those who thought that\nany attempt to produce significant change in our diverse payments landscape would be\nhampered by proprietary interests and a lack of cooperation. But that thinking\nunderestimated the interest and willingness of industry participants to cooperate and to\nproduce a result that none could achieve on their own.\nOver the past two years, we have brought together hundreds of interested parties\nand stakeholders in a broad and highly-motivated coalition that is working together to\nidentify both the promise and the challenges of making end-to-end payment system\nimprovements a reality.\n\n2\n\n\fFaster Payments Task Force\nCentral banks around the world have used government mandates to provide the\ncontrol and direction needed to complete large-scale national initiatives such as payment\nsystem improvement. Here in the United States, the absence of a government mandate\nand the recognition that significant investments in legacy systems were in place, led to a\ndifferent approach.\nThe Faster Payments Task Force now has more than 320 members comprising a\nvariety of interests: technology providers; small, medium and large financial institutions;\npayment networks; trade associations; business end users; and a small number of\ngovernment officials. Importantly, and in many respects unique to such initiatives, the\nTask Force also includes the representation of consumer groups.\nThe Task Force has made remarkable progress and I’d like to give you a sense of\nwhat has been accomplished. Early on, the Task Force committed to a framework that\nwould ensure decisions and work products would have the broad support of its\nmembership, both within and across the various groups represented. With this\nunderstanding, they were able to define detailed criteria for judging the effectiveness\nneeded to deliver faster payments and assess alternative approaches for faster payments\nsolutions.\nIn January, the Task Force created a portal-based forum where solution providers,\nfrom both the general public and within the Task Force, could showcase their payments\ncapabilities. In this way, firms intending to create full end-to-end payment solutions were\nable to view technologies and services that might help fill gaps in their proposals. To\ndate, more than 30 firms — from small startups to large payments and technology\n\n3\n\n\fcompanies — have submitted product descriptions or short videos to the online forum,\noffering a range of expertise.\nSoon after the creation of the capability showcase forum, the Task Force solicited\nproposals for faster payment solutions. Those making submissions were asked to\nillustrate what their solution would do at each stage of the end-to-end payments process,\nfrom the initiation of a transaction through the completion of a payment and\nreconciliation of account balances. An outside consultant, McKinsey & Company, was\nchosen to conduct an independent assessment of each proposal against the criteria\ndeveloped by the Task Force.\nIn total, 22 proposals have been reviewed in the first phase of the assessment\nprocess that occurred from May through September of this year. Just last week, the\nproposals were released to both the Faster Payments Task Force and the Secure Payments\nTask Force, for review and critical feedback. After receiving comments, those who\nsubmitted the proposals will decide whether to remain in the process and release their\nproposals to the general public. The proposals that remain will be included in the Task\nForce’s Final Report to be published in 2017, along with the assessment results and Task\nForce commentary.\nBeyond the evaluation of individual proposals, the Task Force review will\nconsider broadly the structural challenges that could affect the implementation of faster\npayments solutions. In a session later today, you’ll hear more about how the Task Force\nis considering these issues, but let me share some of my views now for the challenges to\nbe addressed.\n\n4\n\n\fGiven the nature of market-driven solutions, interoperability will be a key\nconcern. This is one of the current payments system gaps that led to establishing the\nFaster Payments Task Force. Markets have produced a number of fragmented solutions\nthat deliver desired functionality, but have failed to deliver a ubiquitous and seamless\nexperience for end users.\nInteroperability requires a careful consideration of rules, standards and\ngovernance. We take for granted the ubiquity of our current infrastructure as represented\nin the use of debit and credit cards, ACH and check transactions. But, the interoperability\nwe enjoy with these systems today didn’t happen overnight. In fact, it took years and in\nsome cases was cobbled together piece by piece across multiple providers. As we\ncontemplate faster payment capabilities for the United States, the industry has an\nopportunity to take a more proactive approach on these issues and consider a path to\nadoption so that all consumers and businesses may benefit from these capabilities.\nProgress on bringing faster payments to the United States must keep in focus the\nfundamental responsibility to ensure the overall safety and integrity of the payment\nsystem. Real-time payments present some new risks in addition to those with which we\nare already familiar.\nExperiences around the world and here in our own system prove that these risks\ncan be effectively managed and real-time payments can be safely and securely provided.\nHowever, the challenges we face in successfully achieving our desired outcomes for\nfaster payments will require the same industry collaboration that has brought us to this\npoint. I commend the efforts of the Task Force to anticipate these challenges and\nopportunities, and I look forward to their recommendations in this regard.\n\n5\n\n\fSecure Payments\nRegarding the issue of security, there should be no doubt that dynamic, persistent\nand escalating threats are challenging public confidence in the U.S. payment system. The\ngrowing scale, sophistication, and global nature of cyber threats, along with the\nproliferation in points of vulnerability, has made security a key priority for financial\ninstitutions, payments providers, central banks and regulators around the world.\nMore than 170 individuals joined the Secure Payments Task Force in 2015 to\naddress the most pressing challenges in our existing payment systems and to define the\ncriteria for a safe and secure faster payments future. Let me highlight two areas where\nthis Task Force is focused today.\nPreventing and managing fraud is a key challenge given certain inherent\nlimitations and weaknesses in existing payment systems and processes. Today, there is no\nuniversally accepted way to establish and verify the identity of a payment system\nparticipant. The Task Force has begun to address this problem. Their work will consider\nthe identification and adoption of payment identity management practices, as well as the\nopportunities to share fraud and cyber-threat information and how to analyze related data.\nThese efforts all promise to produce valuable information, tools and insight for\nthe industry. Driving widespread adoption of security improvements, however, remains a\nconsiderable challenge. Fortunately, U.S. payment system security is strong. And\nalthough we remain vigilant, we must keep pace with the rapidly-evolving and expanding\nrisks that threaten the payments ecosystem. I commend the work of the Secure Payments\nTask Force and the collaboration it brings to these important issues.\n\n6\n\n\fBeyond Task Force Efforts\nIn addition to the work of these Task Forces, the Federal Reserve itself is\ninvolved in improving efficiency in the payment system. Through its longstanding\npartnership with the Business Payments Coalition, real progress has been achieved in\nterms of educating small businesses on electronic payments, advancing the development\nand adoption of standards, and understanding and addressing the barriers to straight-and through processing. Of note this year is the establishment of the Business Payments\nDirectory Association, which is working to create a business-to-business directory to\nfacilitate easy, electronic origination of business payments.\nAnd in discussing our collective accomplishments in improving the payment\nsystem, the industry realized an important milestone last month to enhance the speed of\nthe ACH network with implementation of the first phase of SameDay ACH. Within the\nFed, we’ve invested in speeding check clearing and ACH payments, enhancing\nsettlement services, and enriching information services to better support risk and\ncompliance management needs. In partnership with the industry, we are working to align\nwire transfer and ACH systems to global message standards to meet user needs, pave the\nway for greater domestic and cross-border interoperability, and ensure a U.S. payment\nsystem that is relevant and competitive in the global market.\n\nLooking Ahead\nAfter almost two years, I am pleased at the progress we’ve made. We expect to\nmark some significant developments next year. In the first half of 2017, the Faster\nPayments Task Force is scheduled to issue its report in two parts. The first is expected to\n\n7\n\n\flay out the case for faster payments in the United States, and to describe the process\nundertaken to evaluate proposals for improvements. The second part of its report will\ninclude their review of the specific proposals submitted. It will outline what an end-toend faster payment system could look like in the United States and discuss the possible\neffectiveness of different proposals, while highlighting strategic issues deemed important\nto the successful development of faster payments and actions needed to advance\nimplementation and adoption.\nLikewise, the Secure Payments Task Force is likely to publish its views on the\nkey issues it has identified, including payment identity management, information sharing,\ndata protection, and other payment system security issues sometime next year.\nThese reports will mark important milestones, but I believe our greatest challenge\ngoing forward is maintaining the momentum we have achieved so far. It’s also likely that\nsome of our most difficult tasks lay ahead. Much of our collective work to date might be\ndescribed as identifying or designing solutions. We all know that in a marketplace as\ncomplex as our payment system, the real work comes in driving successful\nimplementation and adoption all the way from the central infrastructures through the\nbanking and technology spaces to the hundreds of millions of consumers and business\nwho use these services.\nAs some of these first steps in our payments improvement journey draw to a close\nor reach major milestones over the next year, we look forward to further collaborating to\ndivine the way forward toward our desired outcomes. The Fed’s priority in this important\ninitiative has been to advance and support improvements that are in the public interest\nand will contribute to long-term financial stability and economic growth. We remain\n\n8\n\n\fcommitted to achieving those outcomes so that consumers and businesses have access to\nan efficient, real time and highly secure payment network in the United States.\nThank you.\n\n9\n\n\f"

            "content": "Statement of\nFDIC Vice Chairman Hoenig\nOn the\nSemi-Annual Update\nOf\nThe Global Capital Index\nSeptember 20, 2016\n\nThe degree of leverage within the global financial system increased in the first half of\n2016, as the weighted-average tangible equity capital ratio declined by 22 basis points\nto 5.75 percent across the eight U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) and\nby 23 basis points to 5.45 percent across the foreign G-SIBs, according to data in the\nsemi-annual report of the Global Capital Index released today by FDIC Vice Chairman\nThomas M. Hoenig.\n\"Although equity capital increased for U.S. G-SIBs in the first half of the year, assets\nincreased more than proportionately, including a significant expansion of their\nderivatives book. The net effect was an increase in their overall leverage position. Thus,\nas markets have recovered and as central banks around the world continue quantitative\neasing programs, the incentives for increasing financial leverage have intensified,\" Vice\nChairman Hoenig said.\n\"Within the context of lower capital levels, it is worth noting also that asset quality\nremains an issue, especially in certain foreign jurisdictions. For example, approximately\n7 percent of all loans of European banks are non-performing as compared to 1.5\npercent on the books of U.S. banks. This is no small matter as the ratio of\nnonperforming loans to tangible equity and loan loss reserves -- called the Texas Ratio\n-- is as high as 100 percent for the hardest hit jurisdictions and is more than 40 percent\neven for the European countries least affected by the recent financial crisis, according\nto European Central Bank data\".1\nThe Global Capital Index also shows that global banks with stronger capital as\nmeasured under the leverage ratio and with fewer asset problems generally trade at a\npremium or at less of a discount to book value than banks with weaker capital, as\nshown in column 12. The average price-to-book value for U.S. banks is .9 versus the\naverage price-to-book value of .59 for the foreign banking firms listed.\n\"Overall, the data show that the benefits of higher capital outweigh its costs,\" Vice\nChairman Hoenig said. \"In addition to the financial markets generally rewarding banks\nwith healthier leverage ratios, better capitalized banks lend more and do so on a\nsustained basis over the business cycle, 2 3 and they are less likely to fail or require\nbailouts.4\"\n\"The Global Capital Index also illustrates that while capital levels are greater now than\npre-crisis, they are inadequate for long-term resiliency. In 2008, the 10 largest U.S.\n\n\fbanks held on average 3.1 percent tangible equity capital-to-assets. When the financial\ncrisis hit, these institutions experienced significant losses and required extraordinary\ngovernment support.5 Today, the largest global banks have tangible leverage ratios just\nabove 5 percent, which is hardly adequate to withstand losses similar to those\nexperienced during the last crisis,\" Vice Chairman Hoenig said.\n\"Finally, it is important to note that earlier this month global regulators affirmed that they\nwill not significantly increase overall capital levels as they finalize the Basel III accords.6\nThere are also proposals from some groups that would introduce risk weighting into the\nleverage ratio itself, which would undermine its very purpose as a minimum capital\nstandard. Such actions are unwise as they undermine long-term goals to strengthen the\nfinancial system and achieve stable long-term economic growth,\" he said.\nThe Global Capital Index relies on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to\nmeasure a firm's tangible equity (loss-absorbing capital) against a more complete\nreporting of bank assets by including a more complete reporting of derivative\nexposures, as shown in Column 7 of the table. The largest financial institutions continue\nto reference their risk weighted capital ratios (Column 3) rather than their tangible equity\ncapital ratios (Column 8) to suggest they are well capitalized. However, this higher\nnumber occurs because assumed risk weighted assets represent only 43 percent of\ntotal assets measured under IFRS. The net effect is to reduce assets used in\ncomputing the risk based leverage ratio, thus overstating the true equity capital\navailable to absorb losses relative to the total size of the balance sheet.\nThe Global Capital Index can be found at:\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/global.html.\n###\n1 European Central Bank draft guidance to banks on non-performing loans, September\n2016.\nhttps://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/legalframework/publiccons/pdf/npl/npl_guida\nnce.en.pdf\n2 A 1 percentage point increase in equity-to-total-assets is associated with a 0.6\npercentage point uptick in subsequent growth in lending.

            "content": "Statement of\nEsther L. George\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nbefore the\nHouse Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade\nUnited States House of Representatives\n\nSept. 7, 2016\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its\ngovernors, officers or representatives.\n\n1\n\n\fChairman Huizenga, Ranking Member Moore and members of the subcommittee, thank\nyou for this opportunity to share my views on the role of regional Federal Reserve Banks as part\nof the Federal Reserve System.\nBecause the Federal Reserve is an institution that makes decisions of consequence to the\nbroad public, a discussion of these matters is worthwhile. If changes are to be considered, the\npublic should understand not only the Congressional intent for its current design, but also the\nstrong safeguards that assure its accountability.\nCentral banks are unique institutions. They have important responsibilities for a nation’s\nfinancial system and economy. Congress, as it contemplated a central bank for the United States\nmore than 100 years ago, took note of central bank models from other countries, while keeping\nin mind two earlier attempts at central banking in the United States. Ultimately, it opted for a\ndifferent approach: one that recognized the public’s distrust of concentrated power and greater\nconfidence in decentralized institutions. The Federal Reserve’s unique public/private structure\nreflects these strongly-held views and is designed to provide a system of checks and balances.\nChallenges to this public/private design have surfaced throughout the Federal Reserve’s history,\nnot unlike they have today. But in the end, our country has remained most confident in this\ndecentralized governance structure.\nCriticism of the quasi-private nature of the regional Reserve Banks was anticipated from\nthe start. Indeed, the Federal Reserve Act leaves no unchecked power in Reserve Banks. The\npolitically-appointed members of the Board of Governors have oversight authority of the most\nimportant governance aspects of Reserve Banks. For example, they appoint the Chair and\nDeputy Chair of a Reserve Bank’s board; they vote to approve the selection of the Bank’s\npresident as well as its chief operating officer; and they approve the Reserve Bank’s budget and\n\n2\n\n\fsalaries. The Board of Governors also meets with each Banks’ Chair and Deputy Chair annually\nto review the Bank’s performance and that of its president. Finally, the Reserve Bank’s\noperations are reviewed by the Board of Governors and an outside independent auditor.\nNotwithstanding this strong public oversight, some question the role of commercial banks\nwithin the Fed structure. Here too, important safeguards exist. The supervision and regulation\nof the Federal Reserve’s member banks is a statutory responsibility of the Congressionallyconfirmed Board of Governors. Bankers who serve on Reserve Bank boards are prohibited by\nlaw from participating in the selection of the Bank president, and no director can participate in\nbank supervisory matters. Finally, all directors are required to adhere to high ethical standards of\nconduct and avoid actions that might impair the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s operations\nor in any way discredit the reputation of the System.\nThe capital stock supplied by these member banks serves as the foundation for the\ndecentralized structure allowing for separate corporate entities. Through the regional Reserve\nBanks, private citizens from diverse backgrounds and from the largest to the smallest\ncommunities, have input into national economic policy; strong and varied independent\nperspectives more easily emerge to engage in difficult monetary policy discussions; and the\ncentral bank is provided insulation from short-term political pressures.\nAltering this public/private structure in favor of a fully public construct diminishes these\ndefining characteristics in my view. It also risks putting more distance between Main Street and\nthe nation’s central bank.\nFormer Fed Chairman Paul Volcker understood this well. He experienced first-hand how\npublic pressure can be exerted on a central bank when it must make unpopular decisions that he\nand the FOMC judged to be in the long-run best interest of the economy. In a 1984 speech, he\n\n3\n\n\fnoted the important role of the structure of the Federal Reserve System in supporting the central\nbank’s decision making by saying, “It was all quite deliberately done by men of political\nimagination -- designed to assure a certain independence of judgment, a continuity and\nprofessionalism in staff, a close contact with economic developments and opinion throughout our\ngreat land and a large degree of insulation from partisan or passing political concerns.”1\nTo that end, I extend a personal invitation for any of you to visit the Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City to see what a regional Federal Reserve Bank provides in support of the\ncentral bank’s objectives for economic stability. Thank you. I look forward to taking your\nquestions.\n\nPaul A. Volcker, “Remarks at the 78th Commencement of the American University,” (speech, Washington, D.C., Jan. 29, 1984),\nhttps://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/historical/volcker/Volcker_19840129.pdf\n1\n\n4\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJuly 2016\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\nThe Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act changed the Federal Reserve\nBank stock dividend rate for member banks with assets of more than $10 billion. The Act also\nplaced a cap of $10 billion on the aggregate surplus funds of the Federal Reserve and directed\nthat any excess be transferred to the Treasury general fund. The potential policy implications of\nmodifying dividends to member banks, or more generally, the requirement for member banks to\npurchase stock in a regional Federal Reserve Bank, should be studied carefully before altering\nthis long-standing institutional design of public and private interests serving the American\npublic.\nIn designing the governance structure more than a century ago, Congress accepted a\ncompromise proposal from President Woodrow Wilson to create a central bank with a combined\npublic and private structure with those roles filled respectively by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System and the regional Reserve Banks. In this design, the stock ownership of\nthe regional Reserve banks is a key component in a central bank design that provides\nrepresentation for both the public and private interests with each acting as a potential limit on the\ncontrol of the other.\nThe debate regarding the role of Federal Reserve stock in the Federal Reserve System\nstructure is not a new one: In 1938, Congressman Wright Patman proposed that the government\nshould take over the Reserve Bank stock, effectively turning the regional Reserve Banks into full\ngovernment entities. At the heart of this issue is whether changes that aim to alter the\nprivate/public status of the central bank and potentially nationalize the 12 regional Federal\nReserve Banks could undermine the barriers carefully constructed by Congress to protect against\npolitical pressures on Federal Reserve policies.\nThis analysis offers historical perspective on these issues, as well as an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the current governance and structure of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA LOOK BACK ON CENTRAL BANKING IN THE UNITED STATES\nA careful reading of Federal Reserve history will find that proposals for increased\ngovernment authority over the Federal Reserve are often raised most pointedly during periods\nwhen government debt is high. Pressure on the Federal Reserve to implement policy supportive\nof government spending dates back almost to the 1913 founding of the Federal Reserve and the\n1\n\n\fsubservient role the Federal Reserve soon assumed related to government financing demands in\nconnection with World War I. Similar pressure continued during and after World War II.\nEventually, the Federal Reserve’s resistance to continually supporting government spending led\nto a formal accord with the Treasury in 1951.\nThe list of events that have occurred in these environments is long and includes such\nhigh-profile instances as pressure from President Lyndon Johnson to hold rates low as a means\nof supporting his proposals during the Vietnam War to calls for Federal Reserve Chairman Paul\nVolcker’s resignation during the Federal Reserve System’s successful, but painful, battle against\nhigh inflation. Beyond these major events, numerous legislative initiatives have met varying\ndegrees of success over the years but have overall led to what Duke University economics\nprofessor Thomas Havrilesky termed the “deterioration of traditional constraints on the political\nmanipulation of monetary policy” since the modern Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nwas created in 1935. 1\n\nThe Failure of Earlier Central Bank Designs\nAt the time of the Federal Reserve’s founding, the United States had already witnessed\ntwo unsuccessful attempts at establishing a central bank. Neither was able to outlast their initial\n20-year charter.\nThere was intense political debate around the creation of both the First Bank of the\nUnited States, in 1791, and its successor, the Second Bank of the United States, in 1816. While\nrecognizing the need for the stability that a central bank could provide, many Americans with\nvivid memories of the fight to win independence from England were understandably leery of\ncreating another powerful institution. As a result, both the First and Second Banks were the focus\nof significant public distrust. Both were highly centralized institutions that many Americans\nviewed as too closely aligned with powerful political and financial interests of the Northeast. In\nthe early 1900s, after a series of financial crises, a third effort was launched to create a central\nbank with a structure that combined both government and private interests.\nCarter Glass, the House sponsor of the Federal Reserve Act and the legislation’s key\nauthor, explained the challenges in a report to the 63rd Congress:\n1\n\nT. Havrilesky, “The Politicization of Monetary Policy: The Vice Chairman as the Administration’s Point Man.” Cato Journal,\nVol. 13, No. 1 (Spring/Summer 1993). Copyright Cato Institute.\n\n2\n\n\f“In the United States, with its immense area, numerous natural divisions, still\nmore competing divisions, and abundant outlets to foreign countries, there is no\nargument either of banking theory or expediency which dictates the creation of a single\ncentral banking institution, no matter how skillfully managed, how carefully controlled or\nhow patriotically conducted.”\nAs Glass’s comment suggests, the concern about centralization was not something that\ncould be addressed solely by geography or the number of bank facilities. Nor was it simply a\nquestion about adjusting the bank’s ownership structure. While both of those are elements of a\ndecentralized structure, arguably the most important issue—and the glaring weakness of both the\nFirst and Second Bank—was the centralization, or the perceived centralization, of control.\nIndeed, both the First and Second Banks were geographically diverse with branch offices\nlocated in the important financial centers of their eras. Additionally, both had a combined\npublic/private ownership; however, the ownership structure utilized in each case was problematic\nfor two key reasons: the need for profits, and the homogeneity of ownership and centralization of\ncontrol.\n•\n\nThe Risks of a Structure that Requires Profits\n\nAlthough the nation’s first two central banks had slight differences, particularly in\ntheir size, they were alike in many key structural ways. In both cases, private investors held\nan 80 percent ownership stake while the government held the remaining 20 percent. Investors\nacquired their shares through an initial public offering (IPO) process that was similar to other\npublic stock offerings. In the case of both banks, the IPO involved the immediate sale of\nsubscriptions, or “scrips,” that were essentially a down payment for a later stock purchase.\nScrip and stock purchases for the First Bank, which required the combined use of specie\n(gold or silver) and U.S. debt securities to complete the transaction, created what is now\nconsidered the nation’s first financial crisis when scrip prices soared on high demand,\ncausing debt markets to become distorted. While this distortion and the resulting U.S.\nfinancial crisis was an early indication of one of the many potential risks in a profit-seeking\ncentral bank structure, the era’s more prominent international example involved the\nprivately-held French central bank, Banque de France, which took actions in the 1880s to\n\n3\n\n\fprotect and increase profits—moves that had a negative impact on its effectiveness as a\ncentral bank.\n•\n\nThe Consequences of a Homogeneous Leadership Structure\n\nShares for both the First and Second Banks were prohibitively expensive for most\nAmericans. Stock in the First Bank, for example, was initially offered at $400 per share (the\nequivalent of about $10,000 in 2016 after accounting for inflation). Stock in the Second Bank\nwas still pricey at about a quarter of that cost. As a result, U.S. central bank ownership was\nvested primarily in the hands of wealthy and powerful individuals (including—perhaps\nunexpectedly—a number of foreign investors). Similarly, the majority of the directors of the\nFirst and Second Banks were elected from the ranks of the politically and financially\npowerful, including some members of Congress, who lived in and did business in the\nnation’s power centers. The lack of diversity of central bank leadership was a major\ncriticism, especially from those living outside of the East Coast.\n\nThe Combination of Public and Private Components: Checks and Balances\nEconomic historians sometimes note that the fundamental issue about a U.S. central bank\ncorrelates with the fundamental issue dividing America’s two chief political ideologies: the role\nof government versus the role of the private sector.\nAt the time of the Federal Reserve’s founding, most of the world’s other central banks\nwere privately held institutions. In the United States, the Federal Reserve’s congressional\ncreators recognized that a private structure would not work and instead devised a structure with\nchecks and balances between the private sector and the government. 2\nBalancing government authority over the central bank was not solely about placating\npolitical ideologies that preferred limited government. The primary motivation was to avoid the\nuse of monetary policy and inflation as the means of financing government debt. Related to this\nconcern, of course, was the risk of Federal Reserve policy manipulation for political gain.\n\n2\n\nT. Todd, The Balance of Power: The Political Fight for an Independent Central Bank, 1790-Present, Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City, 2009.\n\n4\n\n\fTo address concerns about national debt funding, the Federal Reserve Act expressly\nprohibited the direct financing of the Treasury. However, since the Federal Reserve’s founding,\npolitical pressure to ease monetary policy has surfaced. 3\nTo mitigate this political pressure, the Federal Reserve’s creators made the Reserve\nBanks private entities under the supervision and control of a board of directors with authority to\nperform all duties usually pertaining to directors of a banking association. This includes the\nappointment of the president and first vice president (directors affiliated with supervised entities\nare no longer involved in this process), appointment of officers, prescribing by-laws, and\ndesignating a representative for the FOMC. As initially designed, the Reserve Banks were far\nmore autonomous than they are today. While the Federal Reserve System’s government\ncomponent has always been responsible for Reserve Bank oversight, the Federal Reserve’s key\nfunctions, including monetary policy, were under the purview of the Reserve Banks during the\nSystem’s early history. Over time, the monetary policy function has become balanced between\nthe private and public components with the Board of Governors holding the majority votes. The\nFOMC consists of 12 members: seven members of the Board of Governors and five Reserve\nBank presidents.\n\nPrivate Sector Involvement\nWhile private sector involvement through a network of separate and distinct Reserve\nBanks located across the country expanded leadership diversity and helped balance government\nauthority, on the surface it presented another problem: how to engage the private sector while\npreventing risks associated with a pure-profit motivation. This aspect was addressed by putting\nrestrictions on Reserve Bank stock and establishing the Board of Governors’ authority for\noversight of the Reserve Banks.\nWhile law requires stock ownership in Federal Reserve Banks as a condition of a\ncommercial bank’s membership in the Federal Reserve System, this stock is not like stock\navailable on public markets. It may not be sold, traded or pledged as security for a loan. It does\npay a dividend rate that is established by statute and, as a result, cannot be manipulated through\nthe use of Federal Reserve policy tools or otherwise. This design provides the Federal Reserve\n3\n\nT. Todd, Under Pressure: Politics and The Federal Reserve During the 1990-1991 Recession, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity, 2011.\n\n5\n\n\fSystem with private ownership over the Reserve Banks, but without the profit motivation that\ncan distort policy.\nStock ownership allows member banks to nominate and elect Class A and B directors to a\nReserve Bank’s Board of Directors. However, unlike traditional corporations which grant one\nvote per share, the Federal Reserve Act provides for class voting wherein each member bank\nreceives one vote as a member of one of three designated classes based on the total amount of\ncapital, surplus and retained earnings of the member bank. There are further limitations on voting\nas each class elects only one Class A and one Class B director.\nIn addition to these restrictions on Reserve Bank stock, the Board of Governors plays an\nimportant oversight role, including its authority to:\n•\n\nExamine at its discretion the accounts, books and affairs of each Reserve Bank;\n\n•\n\nSuspend or remove any officer or director of a Reserve Bank;\n\n•\n\nOrder an annual independent audit of the financial statements of each Reserve\nBank;\n\n•\n\nApprove compensation provided by Reserve Banks to directors, officers, and\nemployees;\n\n•\n\nApprove the president and first vice president appointed by the Reserve Bank\nClass B and C directors; and\n\n•\n\nAppoint three of the nine Reserve Bank directors, including the Reserve Bank’s\nchair and deputy chair.\n\nMEMBER BANKS HELP RESERVE BANKS FULFILL THEIR MISSION\nStockholders of the Federal Reserve System, also referred to as members, have some\nrights and obligations similar to traditional corporate stockholders in that they provide capital to\nthe Federal Reserve Banks, which are federally-chartered corporations. All national banks along\nwith state-chartered banks that choose the Federal Reserve as the bank’s primary federal\nregulator are required to purchase Federal Reserve stock. By purchasing stock, members are\nentitled to a dividend fixed by statute as well as a role in Reserve Bank governance. 4 Members\n4\n\nThe dividend rate was set to 6 percent in the original 1913 Federal Reserve Act to provide a rate of return comparable to\nalternative risky investments and to attract state-chartered banks as members. Investing in the Federal Reserve in 1913 was not\nrisk-free given that the previous two central banks in the United States had not survived and the short-term ability to pay a steady\ndividend was unclear. Today, however, Federal Reserve stock is essentially a risk-free perpetual bond as long as a bank chooses\n\n6\n\n\fare therefore invested in the Reserve Banks’ and Federal Reserve System’s success and are\nintegral to the Federal Reserve’s mission. Member banks must buy stock in the Federal Reserve\nBank equal to 6 percent of the bank’s capital, 3 percent of which is held at the regional Reserve\nBanks. The other 3 percent is callable by the Bank in certain circumstances. Paid-in capital from\nmember banks was the initial funding mechanism for the Federal Reserve Banks, and the 3\npercent on call remains available in the event it is needed by the Reserve Banks.\n\nRole of Member Banks in Governance of Reserve Bank Activities\nStockholding member banks elect a portion of the Reserve Banks’ director seats, 5 are\ncore to Reserve Bank corporate governance and provide critical industry information and\nperspective on economic and banking conditions. At the same time, the structure includes shared\noversight with the politically appointed Board of Governors that prevents members from having\nundue influence on Federal Reserve System activities.\nThe Federal Reserve Act states that every Reserve Bank “shall be conducted under the\nsupervision and control of a board of directors,” and provides that the nine director positions of\nthe Reserve Bank’s board of directors are filled through two methods: election and appointment\n(12 U.S.C. 301). Only three of the nine directors on a Reserve Bank’s board may be officers,\nto remain a member. While the dividend remained unchanged for over a century, analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center found\nit was similar to the average return on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note over that period (A. Klein, K. Readling, O. Weiss, A. Woff;\n“Federal Reserve Dividends Should Not Be a Piggy Bank for Congress.” Bipartisan Policy Center, 2015). The Fixing America’s\nSurface Transportation Act, 129 Sat. 1312 (“FAST Act”), effective Jan. 1, 2016, changed the dividend for stockholder banks with\nmore than $10 billion in total consolidated assets from a fixed 6 percent rate to a dividend equal to the lesser of 6 percent or the\nrate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend.\nThe 10-year Treasury bond rate is seen by some as a reasonable alternative because it is the benchmark risk-free rate used for\nmost long-term, fixed-rate investments and has a long history of continual issuance. The 30-year Treasury rate might also be an\noption because it is the longest maturity Treasury rate, but there is a risk that the Treasury could decide to stop issuing it at some\npoint as it did from late 2001 to early 2006.\nIf a market rate is used as a reference rate, it should not be capped at 6 percent as it currently is for member banks with more than\n$10 billion in assets. Using a market rate only when it is below a threshold is economically inconsistent with the notion of tying\nreturns to the market, and it is inequitable to penalize member banks when rates rise above the threshold. In addition, changing\nthe dividend has raised questions about the appearance of breaking an agreement with members. The American Bankers\nAssociation asserts that the FAST Act’s dividend rate change amounts to an unconstitutional taking of member banks’ property\nwithout compensation. See Letter dated April 28, 2016 from Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers\nAssociation, to Robert de V. Frierson, secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Attachment B). An\nalternative would be to allow current members to retain the 6 percent dividend or elect the 10-year Treasury rate and issue a new\nclass of stock for new members with the dividend tied to the 10-year Treasury rate.\n5\n\nClass A and B directors are nominated and elected by member banks within their respective Federal Reserve District. Unlike\ntraditional corporations, which grant one vote per share, the Federal Reserve Act provides for class voting wherein each member,\nregardless of shares, receives one vote as a member of one of three classes. The classes are designated based on the total amount\nof capital, surplus and retained earnings of the member bank within the class. Not every class votes each year, and each group\nwithin the class elects one Class A and one Class B director.\n\n7\n\n\fdirectors or employees of a bank. Those directors (Class A) are chosen to represent member\nbanks. The remaining six directors (Class B and Class C) cannot be bankers, and are chosen to\nrepresent the public with “due but not exclusive regard to agriculture, commerce, industry,\nservices, labor and consumers” (12 U.S.C. 302). While member banks nominate and elect the\nClass A and Class B directors, this Reserve Bank’s staff plays an important role in considering\nrepresentation from local and regional organizations to identify qualified candidates. Likewise,\nClass C directors are identified by Reserve Bank leadership with appointment by the Board of\nGovernors. The chair and vice chair of the Reserve Bank board of directors must be selected\nfrom the Board of Governors-appointed Class C directors. Reserve Bank directors come from\ndiverse backgrounds in the region and across industries. They must comply with legal\nrequirements and rules related to their eligibility and conduct.\n\nBenefits of Banker Directors\nReserve Banks are nationally chartered banks that serve as the operating arms of the\ncentral bank. They function much like a banker’s bank or a clearing house. As such, banker\ndirectors’ knowledge of the payments system complements the Reserve Banks’ operational role\nin providing financial services to the industry. Indeed, corporate best practices recognize that\n“the key to effective board composition is ensuring that the people gathered around the board\ntable can leverage their experience to contribute in meaningful ways, to understand the issues,\nask the right questions, demand the right information, and make the best possible decisions.” 6\nClass A directors bring informed views related to banking, as well as to the industries of their\ncustomers, and act as consolidators of information. For instance, a banker director can provide\ndetails about lending trends, stresses in the financial system, and other banking metrics, in\naddition to sharing insights into farming, commercial real estate, housing and the auto industry.\nTheir reports at Reserve Bank board meetings offer input to economic analysis used by Reserve\nBank presidents for monetary policy.\n\nLimitations to Banker Influence\nWhile Reserve Bank directors have important oversight responsibilities for the operation\nof their respective Reserve Bank, they have no involvement in the Federal Reserve’s supervision\n6\n\nD. Nadler, B. Behan, and M. Nadler, Building Better Boards (Jossey-Bass 2006).\n\n8\n\n\fof depository institutions. By law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is\nresponsible for the supervision and regulation of banks, and any information or discussion\nrelated to supervisory issues is conducted directly between a regional Reserve Bank’s staff and\nthe Board of Governors. In addition, any supervisory matter regarding a Class A director’s bank\nis handled by the Board of Governors.\nReserve Banks may not provide confidential supervisory information to any director (12\nC.F.R. 261.2). Moreover, Reserve Bank directors may not participate in bank supervisory\nmatters and may not be consulted regarding bank examination ratings, potential enforcement\nactions, application/approval matters, or similar supervisory matters. In regard to the Reserve\nBanks’ lending activity involving financial institutions, directors receive only aggregate\ninformation about loans extended to ensure adequate knowledge of the Reserve Bank’s balance\nsheet per their oversight responsibilities. Finally, if a banker director wants to convert his or her\nbank to Federal Reserve membership or take any other actions that would involve Federal\nReserve regulatory approval, the Board of Governors in Washington must act on the application\nwithout Reserve Bank involvement.\n\nStatutory and Policy Restraints\nThe directors representing member banks are subject to other restraints by statute and\nthrough System policy. As noted above, only Class B and Class C directors appoint, subject to\napproval by the Board of Governors, the Reserve Bank president and first vice president. Class A\ndirectors are excluded from that process to eliminate the perception that they have a role in\nchoosing their regulator. Class A directors also are prohibited from participating in the selection,\nappointment or compensation of Reserve Bank officers whose primary duties involve\nsupervision of banks for the same reason.\nAll directors are subject to the Guide to Conduct for Directors of Federal Reserve Banks\nand Branches, a policy implemented to ensure adherence to high ethical standards of conduct,\nand avoid actions that might impair the effectiveness of Federal Reserve System operations or in\nany way discredit the reputation of the System. The policy details procedures when directors are\ninvolved in procurements as a means to avoid any actual or apparent conflicts of interest.\nFurther, while the policy allows for waivers, it indicates waivers are both highly unlikely and\n\n9\n\n\fstrongly discouraged except under the most exigent and extraordinary circumstances. This\nReserve Bank has never sought a waiver for a director.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAltering the current structure and character of the Federal Reserve System risks\ndiminishing the effectiveness of its operations.\nFor more than a century, the structural design of the Federal Reserve System has\nfunctioned well in carrying out its mandates from Congress. It is possible that Reserve Banks\ncould operate as separate corporate entities without stock ownership, but altering the central\nbanks’ current design creates the potential to diminish its effectiveness.\n•\n\nThe private nature of the Reserve Banks through stock issuance to member banks\nprovides balance to the public nature of the Board of Governors. The public’s trust\nand confidence is enhanced by this “balance of power.”\n\n•\n\nRequiring stock purchases through capital investment creates incentives for member\nbanks to support successful outcomes for the Reserve Banks.\n\n•\n\nRather than a Washington-centric voice for the Federal Reserve System, the\nstructure of 12 separate Reserve Banks encourages strong and varied perspectives\nfrom across the country as the System fulfills its mission.\n\n•\n\nThe structure of the Reserve Banks as separate corporate entities allows private\ncitizens from communities across the country to have input into national economic\npolicy.\n\n•\n\nThe current decentralized structure insulates the Federal Reserve System from\ncertain political pressures, as the Reserve Bank presidents are not political\nappointments, but instead chosen by Class B and Class C directors, with approval\nby the Board of Governors.\n\nNationalizing the Reserve Banks, and thereby making them essentially field offices of the\nBoard of Governors, would dramatically alter these defining characteristics.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nVice Chairman\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n\nPresented to the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) and\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\nGlobal Economic Symposium\nParis, France\nMay 23, 2016\n\n\fThe market no longer determines what is adequate capital for the banking industry. Following\ngenerations of taxpayer support and ever-expanding government involvement, politicians,\nregulators, and lobbyists have supplanted the role of the market in determining what counts as\ncapital, how it is calculated, and how much is enough. An artificial capital framework has thus\ndeveloped, which has resulted in steadily lower levels of capital and declining quality—even\nblurring the distinction between debt and equity. Unfortunately, recent experience has shown\nthat when the marketplace does finally realize it cannot trust such a framework, the\nconsequences for the banking industry and the global economy can be dire.\nEven so, the market remains on the sidelines as regulators and lobbyist renew the conflict over\nwhat constitutes adequate capital. And I would add, the conflict is not really about risk-based\nversus leverage ratios, nor about complex versus simple calculations. Fundamentally, the\nconflict is about whether more or less equity capital best assures that banking firms are sound\nand that economies enjoy strong, sustained growth. Seen in this light, it is apparent why the\ndemand for bank capital ebbs and flows as crises come and go, and why this conflict intensifies\nas economies stabilize.\nIn my remarks today, I will provide a brief historical perspective on bank equity capital, its longterm and recent trends, and its effect on economic stability and growth. I will cite research that\nshows the banking industry and the economy do better in the long run with more—not less—\nequity capital. And I will describe ongoing attempts globally to backtrack from recent successes\nin strengthening equity capital mandates, and my concern that such efforts would prove\ncounterproductive.\nA Brief History of Equity Capital in Banking\nEquity capital is the most stable funding source for the banking industry. It is ownership-funded,\nand unlike debt it cannot run in crisis. Equity absorbs losses before creditors are affected, and a\nbank does not default on its stock if it misses a dividend payment. Thus, equity has long played\na key role in assuring financial and economic stability. However, over time, as bank creditors\nhave come to experience and now to expect governments to protect them from loss, they rely far\nless on a bank’s equity position as a source of confidence. As a result, equity’s relative place on\nthe industry’s balance sheet has systematically declined.\n\n\fChart 1 shows a long decline in equity as a percentage of total assets for the U.S. banking\nindustry over several decades coinciding with the creation of the Comptroller of the Currency in\n1863, the founding of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the creation of\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, all governmental agencies overseeing\nbanking in the United States. As the role of government has increased, the role of equity capital\nhas declined. This might be coincidence, but the evidence suggests otherwise. For example,\nfrom the establishment of the FDIC, which marked the end of the banking crises that followed\nthe Great Depression to the start of the banking crisis of the 1980s, the industry’s average\nreported equity as a percentage of assets declined from approximately 13 percent to less than 8\npercent. Following the crisis of the 1980s and the advent of new legislative mandates,1 the ratio\nincreased to about 10 percent in 2007. Since the most recent crisis, the ratio has increased to\nabout 11 percent.\nChart 1 also shows the more recent trend of tangible equity-to-total tangible assets for the five\nlargest U.S. banking firms, which ranged between 3 and 6 percent from 1990 to the present, with\nthe lowest point occurring in 2007.2 This level of equity proved wholly inadequate during the\nlast banking crisis when the largest firms required substantial government-funded support.3\nChart 2 shows return on equity (ROE) trends for the U.S. banking industry from 1869 to the\npresent. It is often argued that requiring higher equity-to-asset levels would reduce ROE, which\ncould inhibit the industry’s ability to attract capital. However, ROE data seem to contradict this\nview. Although equity capital as a percent of total assets declined significantly during this\nperiod, ROE did not increase as might have been expected. It remained close to 10 percent\nthrough the first half of the 20th century and then slowly and modestly increased during the\nsecond half and to the present.4\n\n1\n\nSee, Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Pub.L.\n101–73.\n2\nFor purposes of comparison in 1931 the average equity to assets of the five largest U.S. banks\nwas 12.74 percent. These banks were Chase National, National City, Guaranty Trust Company,\nContinental Illinois B&T, and Bank of America National B&T, none of which received direct\ngovernment capital injections at that time.\n3\nSee, for example, Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), Emergency Economic Stabilization\nAct of 2008, Pub. L. 110-343.\n4\nThe relationship among capital levels and ROA and ROE were noted by Alan Greenspan in his\nbook, The Map and The Territory, Penguin Press, New York, NY, 2013.\n\n\fThere was a notable temporary spike in this trend for the largest banks during the early 2000s,\nwhen their ROE reached nearly 30 percent. Not surprisingly, however, these returns reflected an\nindustry taking substantial risk. When the real estate bubble burst in 2008, ROE quickly and\ndramatically reversed itself. Since the crisis, ROE appears to be slowly recovering and again\nstands at around 10 percent.\nChart 3 shows the U.S. banking industry’s average return on assets (ROA), which declined from\nmore than 2 percent in the late 19th century to just over 1 percent in the early 20th century and\nbeyond, almost in lock step with declines in the equity-to-assets ratio. Thus, for any number of\nreasons, returns on assets and equity within the banking industry do not appear to benefit in any\nsustained manner from increased leverage over the long term.\nChart 4 shifts the focus from general trends in equity levels and returns to that of comparing\ncapital levels to other measures of performance. It shows trends in U.S. bank loans-to-average\nassets for different levels of equity capital among non-community banks (generally moneycenter and regional banks) from 2004 to the present. It suggests that better capitalized banks\nwere more successful at retaining and extending loans through the economic downturn and\nrecovery than banks with less capital. The decline in lending, and thus the impact on the broader\neconomy, was particularly severe for banks that held less than 8 percent equity capital.\nFinally, Chart 5 compares capital levels among U.S. banks that failed and were taken into FDIC\nreceivership during the recent crisis; it does not include banks that received government support\nto prevent their failure. As might be expected, the percentage of banks with the lowest capital\nlevels failed at a rate nearly double that for the most highly capitalized banks.\nEmpirical Evidence in Favor of Higher Equity Capital\nBeyond these general trends, considerable research supports the proposition that some amount of\nadditional bank equity would facilitate both industry stability and economic growth.\nIn their book The Bankers’ New Clothes, Anat Admati of Stanford University and Martin\nHellwig of the University of Bonn make a compelling case for equity capital to play a far more\ndominant role in banking.5 They note, for example, that few other industries operate under such\nhigh debt positions and favored status; yet these other industries often earn consistently\ncomparable or better returns for their investors. Andrew Haldane, in a paper presented at a\n5\n\nAdmati, Anat & Hellwig, Martin, The Bankers New Clothes, Princeton University Press, 2013\n\n\fFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City symposium, provided a detailed analysis of both the\nusefulness of the equity-to-asset ratio in comparing relative capital levels among banks and the\nfact that banks with higher equity capital levels performed consistently better than those holding\nless capital.6\nIn recent research, Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Economic Adviser and Head of\nResearch Hyun Song Shin concluded that a bank with plentiful “own funds” (equity capital) is\nable to attract creditors at lower costs and on better terms than a less well-capitalized bank. He\nemphasized that both the macroeconomic objective of unlocking bank lending and the\nsupervisory objective of sound banks are better served if banks have more capital. Sound banks\nlend more and do so on a sustained basis over the cycle. He found, for example, that a 1\npercentage point increase in equity-to-total-assets is associated with a 0.6 percentage point uptick\nin subsequent growth in lending.7\nFDIC research staff recently reviewed a broad number of academic studies estimating the tradeoff of more versus less bank equity over an economic cycle.8 The studies generally estimated the\ncost of capital increases as reduced output through higher loan spreads and decreased investment,\nor through effects on loan supply resulting from changes in underwriting standards or credit\nrationing. The expected benefits were then modeled as a reduction in the probability of incurring\noutput-destroying financial downturns and crises.\nIn most instances the studies found that the benefits of higher capital outweigh its costs, up to the\nlevels specified under current rules and perhaps beyond, serving the long-run interest of the\nmacroeconomy.\nIn summary, considerable compelling data suggest that more equity capital--not less--is the\nbetter choice to attain sound banks and sustained economic growth.\n\n6\n\nHaldane, Andrew G., “The Dog and the Frisbee,” Economic Symposium, Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, 2012. http://www.bis.org/review/r120905a.pdf\n7\nShin, Hyun Song, “Bank Capital and Monetary Policy Transmission,” panel remarks at the\nECB and Its Watchers XVII conference, Frankfurt, April 7, 2016,\nhttp://www.bis.org/speeches/sp160407.pdf.\n8\nPogach, Jonathan, “Literature Review on the Macroeconomic Impacts of Capital\nRequirements,” FDIC Division of Insurance and Research,\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/2016-05-12-lr.pdf.\n\n\fEmerging Challenges\nIn the conflict over what is the appropriate amount of equity capital within banking, the leverage\nratio has been shown to be a highly useful measure for judging capital adequacy. In 2012,\ntherefore, the international community began to use a leverage ratio to set a floor for the banking\nindustry’s capital levels, including for the largest banks. Some countries have gone further,\nraising minimum equity requirements to enhance the resilience and performance of banking\nfirms within their boundaries.\nAs the memory of the 2008 financial crisis fades, however, the banking industry has begun to\nlobby for special treatment or exemptions from capital requirements for a host of assets included\nin the leverage ratio calculation for judging capital adequacy. If accepted, the effect of such\nproposals would be to again lower acceptable capital standards for this most important industry.9\n10\n\nOne such proposal, from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, is to change the\nStandardized Approach to Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR). On April 6 the committee\nannounced plans to apply measurement methodologies previously used for the risk-based capital\nrules to the leverage ratio. Under the proposal the committee could exempt from inclusion in the\ndenominator of the leverage ratio certain types of assets that are deemed lower risk. It could\npermit more types of collateral to offset certain exposures and, thus, remove assets from the\nbalance sheet for purposes of judging the adequacy of capital. The proposal could go so far as to\nreduce capital requirements against derivatives, which are intrinsically levered instruments and\nwere at the forefront of the last crisis.11\nThese and other possible changes in the computation and measurement of capital adequacy if\nadopted would convert the leverage ratio—the purpose of which is to provide a pure measure of\nequity capital to total assets—into a risk-based measure. Such proposed changes would confound\nthe purpose and obscure the conclusions of the leverage ratio. Assuming the leverage ratio, like\n9\n\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision, “The Standardised Approach for Measuring\nCounterparty Credit Risk Exposures,” March 31, 2014, http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs279.htm.\n10\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision, “Revisions to the Basel III Leverage Ratio\nFramework – Consultative Document,” April 25, 2016, http://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d365.htm.\n11\nFor more detail on the manner in which the SA-CCR and modifications to the treatment of\ncollateral would impact the leverage ratio, see April 22, 2016 Risk Magazine op-ed by Thomas\nHoenig. https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/op-ed-042516.html\n\n\fthe risk-based ratio, decreases reported bank assets, capital levels would trend down and would\nagain, over time, compromise the strength of the industry, expose the public to loss, and,\nundermine the stability of the economy.\nConclusion\nLet me close by acknowledging that any number of factors determine success or failure for\nbanking firms and the economy in general. However, bank equity capital certainly ranks high in\nimportance among such factors. Data show that when bank equity capital levels are allowed to\ndecline to steadily lower levels, economic growth is not enhanced in any sustainable manner and\ntoo often falls victim to financial turmoil.\nIn the absence of the industry supporting itself with its own equity capital as it entered the last\nbanking crisis, governments had to step in with an infusion of public funds, to both the banking\nsector and the national economy. It is at significant public cost that old lessons are relearned:\nbalance sheet strength matters, equity matters, and it is not credible to base public policy on the\nposition that in the short-run high leverage accelerates economic growth. Bank performance\nthrough the entire cycle matters, and strong performance requires strong capital.\nUntil such time as banks are capitalized based upon the marketplace’s assessment of risk that is\nindependent of the specter of taxpayer support and government involvement, the problem of too\nbig to fail will remain. As long as regulators are complicit at assigning weights for a bank’s\nmeasurement of risk and its internal allocation of risk capital, as is the case with risk-based\ncapital, they perpetuate a moral hazard whereby investors rely on the regulators’ approval of\nbank capital levels and structure. They too quickly assume that the regulators’ intimate\nknowledge of a bank’s risk profile must surpass their own. How can this not lead to the\nassumption that a bank will be bailed out if the regulators’ capital framework results in a\nmisallocation of capital? The blunt nature of the leverage ratio makes no assumption that the\nregulators have appropriately measured a bank’s idiosyncratic risk. To the contrary, the leverage\nratio provides a minimum base of capital dependent solely on asset size, and it telegraphs to\nbanks and to the marketplace that they themselves must make the risk assessment and internally\nallocate capital resources appropriately.\n\n\fThe final table in your packet of material is entitled the Global Capital Index (GCI).12 It tracks\nthe relative standings of the capital positions of the largest global banking firms using the many\nalternative ratios for judging the adequacy of bank capital. It also breaks out the relative average\ncapital levels of different size banks in the United States and the price-to-book ratios. I\nencourage you to study the table, especially column 8, for insight into the conflict over capital\nand whether more equity or more debt will best serve the macroeconomy going forward.\n\n###\nThe views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of the FDIC.\nThomas M.

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMay 12, 2016\nBusiness and Community Leaders Luncheon\nAlbuquerque, N.M.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fI’m pleased to be in Albuquerque with our Kansas City and Denver office boards\nof directors.\nAs a regional Federal Reserve Bank president, I gain important insights about the\nregional and national economy from visits like this one, where I have the opportunity to\nmeet with business and community leaders. Their perspectives and concerns, combined\nwith economic data and analysis, help shape my own views on monetary policy.\nIn my remarks today, I’ll talk about the economic issues we see in New Mexico\nand the nation. I’ll also note the current stance of interest rate policy, and why, as a\nvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, I have argued that\ninterest rates should gradually return to more normal levels. Before I continue, however, I\nwant to note that these are my own views and are not necessarily representative of others\nin the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe New Mexico Economy\nNew Mexico has struggled to recover from the recession that ended nearly seven\nyears ago. Although employment has increased, the gains have been modest and held\nback by several factors. First, the construction sector was slow to bounce back after the\nsevere downturn in the housing sector. The crisis left the state with high inventory levels\nand sharply lower prices. Then, austerity measures at the federal government level led to\ncutbacks that were sharply felt here. As neighboring states recovered more quickly, New\nMexico saw workers move out of the state, exacerbating its challenges.\nOver the past year, new concerns have emerged and growth has slowed once\nagain. Parts of the state that had been doing quite well are now facing sharp declines in\n\n1\n\n\factivity due to weakness in the energy and agriculture sectors. Employment in the energy\nsector has declined 26 percent in New Mexico over the past year, and weakness is\nstarting to spread to related industries, with the transportation and wholesale trade sectors\nalso reporting employment losses. The drop in energy activity is also starting to weigh on\nstate and local finances, which can lead to government spending cuts that can further\nweigh on employment.\nAt the same time, there are other sectors and areas of the state that are doing\nbetter. Employment growth in Albuquerque recently reached its fastest pace since mid2013, and outside of energy and agriculture-dependent areas, it appears that the recovery\nis accelerating. Home inventory levels have dropped significantly in the metro area, home\nprices have stabilized, and residential construction activity is finally picking up. The\nhealthcare sector also continues to expand and tourism activity has picked up over the\npast couple of years. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the Sandia Peak Tramway\nand the Anderson Abruzzo International Balloon Museum with our Kansas City and\nDenver Branch Boards of Directors. We heard about the robustness of the tourism\nindustry in the state and the wonderful Balloon Fiesta that takes place here each fall.\nThen, this morning, we heard about another growing sector in the New Mexico economy\n—entrepreneurship.\nOverall, healthcare, tourism, construction and entrepreneurship are poised to drive\ngrowth in the Albuquerque area, though softness in the energy, agriculture, and state and\nlocal government sectors will likely remain for some time.\n\n2\n\n\fThe U.S. Economic Outlook\nYou may ask how the economic developments facing New Mexico fit into the\nlarger regional, as well as national, picture. Throughout the Tenth Federal Reserve\nDistrict, which covers seven states, the fall in commodity prices has been a major\neconomic shock. While the recent increase in the price of some commodities offers a bit\nof relief, there is little doubt that lower prices will require some major adjustments. For\nexample, energy production will likely continue to decline and workers in the sector will\nneed to look to other industries that are doing better, such as construction. In addition, the\nmanufacturing and export sectors have been contracting, reflecting both the decline in\nenergy activity and the strong dollar.\nEven as these sectors of our economy face strains, other aspects of the regional\nand national economy show more robust growth. In fact, the U.S. economy has proven\nitself to be quite resilient in recent years, and I expect the moderate pace of growth\nexperienced during this recovery will continue. Granted, the economy is subject to some\nshort-term ups and downs. We saw GDP growth was rather weak during the first quarter,\nbut the growth rate over the past year is near 2 percent—a pace that is close to the\naverage during this recovery. More importantly, employment growth has remained\nstrong. The economy has added close to 200,000 jobs on average each month this year.\nThe longer-term pace of job growth has also been quite robust. As a result, the\nunemployment rate currently stands at about 5 percent, compared to 10 percent after the\nfinancial crisis in 2009. Of course, the unemployment rate is an imperfect measure of the\nlabor market, so I also pay close attention to other data. For example, one development I\nfind promising is that many individuals who had dropped out of the workforce are finding\n\n3\n\n\fjobs. After the crisis, the percentage of people participating in the labor market fell\nsharply. Some of this is because our population is aging, so people naturally work less as\nthey get older. However, some of the decline in labor force participation was due to\nworkers being discouraged about their job prospects. More recently, however, we have\nseen an upswing in people finding jobs who had previously stopped looking for one. For\nexample, close to 2 million workers returned to the labor force over the past six months.\nThis pace of re-entry is close to the fastest pace in more than 15 years.\nDespite these positive developments, wage growth has remained sluggish and\nmany people still feel like they have limited options in the labor market. That being the\ncase, let me spend some time on the labor market.\n\nLabor Market Trends From Two Perspectives\nAs I travel around my region to meet with business, community, and labor\nleaders, I often hear them describe the job market from two very different perspectives.\nOne perspective is of a booming labor market, rising wages and an abundance of\nopportunity. The other perspective is of stagnant wage growth, limited upward mobility\nand job insecurity.\nHow can these different views be reconciled? Looking at general labor market\ndata, we have seen a steady improvement in employment over the past seven years. In\nfact, 14 million net new jobs have been created since the crisis. Along with an\nunemployment rate that is currently near normal, the economy appears to be close to full\nemployment. As a result, many business leaders often discuss the challenge of hiring\nworkers with the right skills and say that numerous job openings remain unfilled. In fact,\n\n4\n\n\fthere are currently around 5.8 million job openings in the United States, which is near the\nhighest level on record. I often hear about the need to raise wages rapidly to retain these\nworkers, and as a result, the national data showing slow wage growth doesn’t ring true to\nmany business leaders. But while this aspect of job growth looks pretty good, there are\nunderlying trends that suggest that the recovery has not been evenly spread across all\ntypes of workers.\nThe other perspective on labor market developments reflects a trend that has been\npresent over the past three decades. In particular, the share of workers in middle-skill jobs\nhas fallen sharply. For decades, these jobs were the bedrock professions of the middle\nclass. If we look back to the 1980s, examples of middle-skill jobs that were much more\nprevalent than today include assembly-line manufacturing jobs, clerical and\nadministrative positions.\nThe steady decline in these types of jobs is not a new story. However, demand for\nboth higher-skilled and lower-skilled workers is growing faster relative to middle-skilled\nworkers. This employment phenomenon is called “job polarization.” In 1983, nearly 60\npercent of all jobs were in middle-skill occupations. By 2016, that share has declined to\n44 percent. By current employment levels, this would be equivalent to a shift of 22\nmillion jobs away from middle-skill occupations toward both high- and low-skill\noccupations.\nThe decline in middle-skill jobs is the result of a number of sweeping changes\naffecting the economy. With the adoption of computers and advanced technologies,\nbusinesses have fundamentally changed the way they operate and the types of workers\n\n5\n\n\fthat they require. At the same time, the rapid increase in globalization has provided new\nopportunities for some companies, while increasing competition for others.\nManufacturing, for instance, is a sector that has historically demanded a large\nnumber of middle-skilled jobs. However, both global forces and technological advances\nhave had a profound effect on manufacturing employment. Today, fewer than 10 percent\nof workers in the United States are employed in the manufacturing sector compared to\nmore than 20 percent in 1980. These trends are unlikely to reverse, and continued\ntechnological innovations will likely broaden their reach into both higher- and lowerskilled jobs.\nThe dramatic shifts tied to job polarization offer some explanation as to why\nmany people feel that their economic prospects haven’t improved. On average, salaries\nfor middle-skill jobs are close to the median income for all workers. As opportunities for\nworking in a middle-skill job, and thus a middle-class lifestyle, have dwindled, workers\nhave increasingly been faced with a choice between two distinct paths. For workers who\nacquire the education and training required for high-skill jobs, they have the opportunity\nto pursue employment in jobs that typically pay 50 percent more than the median salary.\nBut for those workers who do not have the needed training and skills, their options are\nincreasingly shifting toward low-skill jobs that typically pay 50 percent below the median\nsalary.\nUnderstanding these trends helps to reconcile the two versions of the labor market\nI described earlier. Business leaders trying to develop new businesses and technologies\nrequire high-skilled workers, which remain in short supply. Alternatively, the millions of\n\n6\n\n\fother workers in traditional middle-skill occupations may not have the option of spending\nmonths, or years, to update their skills. These workers face insecurity about their career.\n\nThe Role of Monetary Policy\nAs the Federal Reserve considers these and other economic trends, it must weigh\na number of crosscurrents to determine the appropriate interest rate policy. In the shortrun, I continue to monitor how the energy, agricultural and manufacturing sectors are\nadjusting relative to the national economy. And over the longer-run, I evaluate what\ntrends like job polarization mean for monetary policy. These are challenging questions\nwith no easy answers. For the most part, monetary policy is limited in the support it can\noffer any particular sector. It is also limited in its ability to affect trends like job\npolarization.\nInstead, monetary policy has the broad goals of promoting stable prices, full\nemployment, and moderate long-term interest rates. Since the crisis, conditions have\nimproved sufficiently that the FOMC deemed it appropriate to raise the target range for\nthe federal funds rate by 25 basis points last December. This was a significant step, as it\nwas the first increase in short-term interest rates since the middle of 2006. No further\nadjustments have occurred this year, as the FOMC weighs economic developments and\nmonitors risks to the outlook. The current setting for the federal funds rate is well below\nwhat the FOMC expects will prevail in the longer term. The plan is to move gradually\nand in a way that is responsive to economic developments.\nI support a gradual adjustment of short-term interest rates toward a more normal\nlevel, but I view the current level as too low for today’s economic conditions. The\n\n7\n\n\feconomy is at or near full employment and inflation is close to the FOMC’s target of 2\npercent, yet short-term interest rates remain near historic lows. Just as raising rates too\nquickly can slow the economy and push inflation to undesirably low levels, keeping rates\ntoo low can also create risks. Interest-sensitive sectors can take on too much debt in\nresponse to low rates and grow quickly, then unwind in ways that are disruptive. We\nwitnessed this during both the housing crisis and the current adjustments in the energy\nsector. Because monetary policy has a powerful effect on financial conditions, it can give\nrise to imbalances or capital misallocation that negatively affects longer-run growth.\nAccordingly, I favor taking additional steps in the normalization process.\nMoving rates to a more-normal level and at a gradual pace is necessary to\nminimize distortions in the economy that can build over many years when rates are held\nso low. With gradual adjustments, the Federal Reserve is more likely in my view to\nachieve its long-run goals and by doing so, foster conditions for steady growth that\nbenefit both New Mexico and the nation.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "FDIC Board Meeting Statement of Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig regarding 2015 Title I plans\nsubmitted by the eight domestic GSIBs\nApril 13, 2016\nAs delivered\nI concur with the general conclusions of agency staff regarding the 2015 Title I plans submitted by the\neight domestic global systemically important banking organizations, and I concur that individual findings\nbe forwarded to the appropriate firm. As reflected in the letters before us, each plan has shortcomings or\ndeficiencies, although as the letters emphasize, some firms have made more progress than others. Most\nimportantly, no firm yet shows itself capable of being resolved in an orderly fashion through bankruptcy.\nThus, the goal to end too big to fail and protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts remains just\nthat: only a goal.\nNo GSIB has yet shown how it would successfully address all phases of a successful bankruptcy if its\nfailure were imminent. Weaknesses vary by individual firm and include, for example: how a firm\ndetermines when to enter bankruptcy; how its resolution strategy aligns with bankruptcy court processes;\nwhether there is adequate liquidity and debtor-in-possession financing; and how it would pass capital to\noperating units in anticipation of bankruptcy. Having answers to these issues for each GSIB is critical to\nsuccessfully move one through bankruptcy.\nMoreover, the challenge of taking a GSIB through bankruptcy has only increased since the crisis of 2008.\nThese firms are generally larger, more complicated, and more interconnected than they were then. They\ncontrol assets equivalent to approximately 60 percent of GDP. They continue to rely on wholesale\nfunding, deposit-like money market funds, and repos, all of which are major sources of volatility in\nuncertain times. The average notional value of derivatives for the three largest derivative dealers among\nthese GSIBs was approximately $50 trillion at yearend 2015, about a 30 percent increase over their level\nat the start of the crisis.\nWhile having a credible living will is essential to the Title 1 process, it unfortunately is not sufficient to\nassure an orderly bankruptcy. The living will process assumes that individual GSIBs would be able to\nwithstand the systemic shock arising from the failure of another GSIB. Currently this is an unrealistic\nassumption. As I have pointed out elsewhere, these GSIBs have excessively high leverage ratios of nearly\n18 to 1 on average, while the remainder of the industry with its smaller systemic impact has an average\nleverage ratio of only 10 to 1. Ironically and unfortunately there is little margin of error for these most\nsystemically important firms, and the market knows this. This factor adds enormously to the difficulty of\nmaking bankruptcy successful. If one highly leveraged GSIB were to fail, other also highly leveraged\nGSIBs immediately would become suspect in their ability to withstand the shock. Too easily one failure\ncould become a systemic crisis.\nMost of these plans are reliant on the single point of entry (SPOE) strategy. It requires significant\ndependence on the long-term debt component of TLAC, which serves as a justification for holding less\nequity capital and makes the system more vulnerable to financial shocks. Thus, there is a legitimate\nquestion as to whether these firms individually and thus collectively have sufficient equity capital to\nwithstand the shock of even a single GSIB failure.\nFinally, in considering debt versus equity, I am concerned that the guidance provided for the next plan\nsubmissions includes the following statement: “...the methodology is not required to produce aggregate\nlosses that are greater than the amount of external TLAC that would be required for the firm under the\nBoard's proposed rule.” Such a statement is highly questionable since regulators cannot administratively\n\n\fcontrol future losses, and this statement appears designed to assure that losses do not undermine the onpaper success of the SPOE solution. I would remove this statement from the guidance.\nThe sources of too big to fail are both industry-wide in terms of leverage and GSIB-specific in terms of\neach firm’s obstacles to bankruptcy, which is expected of every other business organization in the United\nStates. Bankruptcy as sought under Title I, thus, remains an aspiration until both issues are addressed.\n\n\f"

            "content": "Statement of FDIC Vice Chairman Hoenig\non the Semi-Annual Update of the Global Capital Index\nApril 12, 2016\nThe semi-annual update of the Global Capital Index, showing the capital ratios for Global\nSystemically Important Banks, was released Tuesday by FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M.\nHoenig.\nThe Global Capital Index relies on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to\nmeasure a firm’s tangible equity (loss-absorbing capital) against a more complete reporting of\nbalance sheet assets, as shown in column 8 of the table.\nAmong the data:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the largest U.S. banking firms, the average tangible equity capital ratio – known\ninversely as the leverage ratio – increased 24 basis points to 5.97 percent from 5.73\n(column 8). In other words, the US GSIBs fund each dollar assets with about 94 cents of\nborrowed money.\nThe largest regional and community banks, shown in the last three rows of column 8,\nhave higher tangible capital ratios ranging from 8.31 to 9.76 percent.\nThe largest financial firms continue to report that their risk weighted measure (column 3)\ncomputes to a relatively higher level. This occurs because assumed risk weighted assets\nrepresent only 49 percent of total assets under IFRS. The effect is to reduce assets used\nin computing the leverage ratio, thus overstating the capital available to absorb losses\nrelative to the total balance sheet.\n\n“The loss-absorbing tangible capital levels of the largest U.S. banks are increasing, and it is\nimportant that this progress continue to a point where they reach solid levels of tangible capital\nto effectively move the cost of downside risk from the public to the firms,” Vice Chairman\nHoenig said. “It is noteworthy that as the tangible capital of U.S. GSIBs has increased relative to\ntheir foreign counterparts, so have the lending levels of American firms and the overall health of\nthe American economy compared with Europe.”\n“As encouraging as the trend in capital is for U.S. GSIBs, I find it unfortunate that the Basel\nCommittee last week has recommended changes to the international leverage ratio that would\nsignificantly weaken it – even if its capital requirements are increased -- by turning it into a riskweighted measure. Doing so would significantly dilute the effectiveness of the most reliable\nmeasure of bank capital and result in increased leverage that does not serve the financial system,\nbroader economy, or even the firms well over the full course of an economic cycle.”\nThe Global Capital Index, among other things, illustrates the difference in capital ratios when\nbank assets are measured using US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) versus\nIFRS. IFRS includes the fair value of all assets including derivatives (column 7), while GAAP\n\n\fdoes not (column 5). Specifically, the tangible capital measurement in the Global Capital Index\nis calculated by comparing equity capital to total assets, after deducting goodwill, other\nintangibles, and deferred tax assets from both equity and total assets. The IFRS’s balance sheet\nalso reports the fair value of derivatives and other assets that are otherwise off-balance-sheet in\nGAAP. The tangible leverage ratio measures funds available to absorb loss against total balance\nsheet assets reported under the IFRS standard. It does not attempt to predict or assign relative\nrisk weights among asset classes. In contrast, the ratios of Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets\nfor all banks (column 3), largest to smallest, are above 10 percent and some of the largest have\nratios of more than 15 percent. The higher capital ratio is achieved by reducing on-balance sheet\nassets by a pre-assigned risk weight and excluding off-balance sheet assets, such as derivatives.\n“This risk-based measure is misleading and overstates the strength of these firms’ balance sheets.\nNo other industry is allowed to make these kinds of adjustments,” Vice Chairman Hoenig said.\n“In contrast to risk-based calculations, the tangible leverage ratio accurately measures bank risk\nand prices it correctly. It has done a reliable job of aligning a firm’s risk appetite with its lossabsorbing capacity, providing more direct insight into the amount of loss-absorbing capital\navailable to a firm and providing a consistent and comparable measure across firms.”\n###\nThomas M.

            "content": "The Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nApril 7, 2016\nEconomic Forum\nYork, Neb.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\f“It seems rather striking that one of the ideas now firmly imbedded in our articles\nof material faith, the concept of governmental responsibility for moderating economic\ngyrations, is almost entirely a product of our own Twentieth Century.\n“This concept, which is steadily being brought into sharper focus, has evolved\nfrom general reaction to a succession of material crises heavy in human hardship. It\ngrew from mass desperation and demand for protection from economic disasters beyond\nindividual control.\n“The Federal Reserve System, which I have the honor to represent, was our\nearliest institutional response to such a demand. It emerged out of the urgent need to\nprevent recurrences of such disasters as the money panic of 1907, and out of the thought\nthat the Government had a definite responsibility to prevent financial crises and should\nutilize all its powers to do so.\n“Accordingly, … Congress entrusted to the Federal Reserve System responsibility\nfor managing the money supply. This was a historic and revolutionary step. In framing\nthe Federal Reserve Act great care was taken to safeguard this money management from\nimproper interference by either private or political interests. That is why we talk about\nthe overriding importance of maintaining our independence. Hence we have our system\nof regional banks headed up by a coordinating Board in Washington intended to have\nonly that degree of centralized authority required to discharge effectively a national\npolicy. This constitutes, as those of you in this audience recognize, a blending of public\ninterest and private enterprise uniquely American in character. Too few of us adequately\nrecognize or adequately salute the genius of the framers of our central banking system in\nproviding this organizational bulwark of private banking and business.\n\n1\n\n\f“Since the Federal Reserve System came into being, the problems of inelasticity\nof currency and immobility of bank reserves -- which so often showed up as shortages of\ncurrency or credit in times of critical need -- have been eliminated, and money panics\nhave largely disappeared.\n“In this specialized respect there can be no doubt that the System has made\nnotable progress, but in the more fundamental role of stabilizing the economy the record\nis not so clear. All of us in the System are bending our best efforts to capitalize on the\nexperience of the past, and our current knowledge of money, so as to make as large a\ncontribution as possible in this direction. But a note should be made here that, while\nmoney policy can do a great deal, it is by no means all powerful. In other words, we\nshould not place too heavy a burden on monetary policy. It must be accompanied by\nappropriate fiscal and budgetary measures if we are to achieve our aim of stable\nprogress. If we ask too much of monetary policy we will not only fail but we will also\ndiscredit this useful, and indeed indispensable, tool for shaping our economic\ndevelopment.”1\nI’ll pause here to give credit to former Federal Reserve Chairman William\nMcChesney Martin, who delivered these remarks on October 19, 1955. His remarks\nmore than six decades ago remain relevant today and in particular echo my own concern\nthat the public has come to expect that monetary policy can solve for every problem that\nails the U.S. economy.\nI am here in York, Nebraska, with members of our Omaha Branch office board of\ndirectors, who serve as important windows on the current economic landscape. Those\n\nAddresss of William McChesney Martin, before the New York Group of the Investment Bankers\nAssociation of America, Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York City, Oct. 19, 1955\n1\n\n2\n\n\finsights are enormously valuable to me as I make my own assessments of the economy\nand form my policy views as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThis evening, I’ll offer you my thoughts on the state of the economy and current\nstance of monetary policy. As you may know, I did not agree with the Committee’s\ndecision to hold rates steady at the most recent policy meeting last month. I’ll explain\nmy views about policy, noting these are my own views and are not necessarily\nrepresentative of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nHere in Nebraska, a state with a significant agricultural profile, the economy has\nsoftened, as Nathan noted earlier in his remarks. Across much of our region, the\ndowndraft in commodity prices, combined with a strong dollar, has had a chilling effect\non the regional economy.\nFarm income is expected to weaken modestly in 2016, which would mark a third\nconsecutive year in the current downturn. As lower income reduces cash flows, demand\nfor credit among farmers has continued to rise. At this stage, the delinquency rate on\nagricultural production loans remains well below levels from five years ago, and\nfarmland values, which are a significant contributor to the health of farm balance sheets,\nhave remained relatively stable. Should these values erode further, we might expect to\nsee further stresses on the agricultural sector.\nLikewise, the dramatic fall in oil and gas prices over the past 18 months has\nnegatively affected the region. The number of active oil and gas rigs in the United States\nhas fallen by three-quarters, from almost 2,000 rigs at the peak to less than 500 today.\n\n3\n\n\fWeakness in energy-related investment has spread to upstream suppliers in\nmanufacturing sectors, resulting in broader signs of slowing capital investment across the\nnation.\nCredit conditions have tightened for energy-related companies, and strains on the\nearnings are leading to substantial job losses, particularly within our region, which\nincludes Oklahoma and Wyoming. The challenges facing those affected are substantial,\nalthough we do see that some of these workers are finding employment more easily than\nthey did during the last oil price shock.2\nBeyond these sectors, the U.S. economy as a whole has continued to expand, and\nit has been quite a long economic expansion by historical standards. Indeed, the FOMC\nviewed the economy as sufficiently sound last December to warrant increasing short-term\ninterest rates.\nSince the December meeting, economic data have largely confirmed an outlook\nfor further growth. We have received four strong labor reports as well as data showing\nthat inflation is moving higher.\nUnfortunately, however, the initiation of raising interest rates coincided with what\nappears to be a more vulnerable global economy, and a domestic economy that appears to\nbe slowing in the first quarter and is threatened by markets that are anxious, uncertain,\nand volatile. Faced with these dynamics, the Federal Reserve’s decisions to continue to\nnormalize its policy settings have become more difficult.\nIn the face of such headwinds and uncertainty, the FOMC is guided by a focus on\nlonger-run objectives—those objectives outlined by Congress in the Federal Reserve Act\n\n2\n\nBrown, Jason and Andres Kodaka, “The Reallocation of Energy-Sector Workers after Oil Price Booms\nand Busts,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, The Macro Bulletin, March 3, 2016.\n\n4\n\n\fand expressed by the FOMC in its annual Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy: “The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open\nMarket Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates\ncommensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to\npromote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates.”3\nAlthough financial markets were off to a volatile start this year, economic\nfundamentals remain relatively strong, particularly conditions in the labor market. More\njobs were added in both 2014 and 2015 than in any other year since the late 1990s. This\ntrend has continued with the economy adding an average of more than 200,000 net new\njobs per month in 2016. The ongoing strength in job gains is well above the trend rate\nneeded to absorb new entrants into the labor force. As a result, we have seen people who\nhad been on the sidelines and not working over the past five years start to re-enter the\nlabor force. And even as people have returned to the labor market, job growth has been\nstrong enough so that the unemployment rate continued to fall over the last year. At 5.0\npercent, the unemployment rate is quite close to the longer-run estimate of normal.\nIn addition to a healthy labor market, consumer spending has been supported by\nstronger household balance sheets. There are, of course, exceptions, but overall,\nhousehold budgets generally look far less extended today than they did in the mid-2000s.\nThe debt service ratio, which measures the burden of debt payments relative to income, is\nalso lower than at any other time since the Federal Reserve started collecting data on this\nmeasure in 1980.\n\n3\n\nSection 2A of the Federal Reserve Act as amended by the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.\n\n5\n\n\fHousehold balance sheets also have benefited from housing prices. On a national\nbasis, prices are close to where they were prior to the crisis. The supply of homes remains\nquite limited, relative to the total number of households, and is the lowest it’s been for\nmore than 40 years.4 This combination of limited inventory, robust job growth and low\ninterest rates will likely support continued home price appreciation. Those positive\nconditions will remain tempered by other factors weighing on housing. Credit conditions\nremain tighter than before the crisis, and bankers tell me new mortgage application\nprocedures pose some challenges in moving borrowers through the financing process.\nOverall, I view the health of household balance sheets and robust job growth as\nproviding a foundation for consumer spending to continue making steady contributions to\neconomic growth. This should allow GDP growth to continue near 2 percent, which I\nview as consistent with the economy’s long-run potential.\nWith an unemployment rate of 5.0 percent, the economy is near full employment.\nMeasures of inflation appear to reflect stable prices with upward movement in core PCE\ninflation year-over-year (from 1.3 percent to 1.7 percent over the past three months). In\nthe interest of objectives to promote long-run sustainable growth with healthy\nemployment and price stability, I believe monetary policy should respond to these\ndevelopments by slowly removing accommodation.\n\nThe Current Stance of Monetary Policy\nToday, monetary policy can be viewed as highly accommodative for three\nreasons. First, the current federal funds target range of between 0.25 percent to 0.5\n\n4\n\nRappaport, Jordan, “The Limited Supply of Homes,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, The Macro\nBulletin, March 23, 2016.\n\n6\n\n\fpercent is quite far from the fed funds’ long-run level, which the FOMC views at around\n3.25%. Second, the FOMC has signaled that the fed funds rate will be raised only\ngradually. And third, the Fed continues to hold a $4.2 trillion balance sheet, which has\nthe effect of keeping longer-term interest rates low.\nYears of experience, evidence and research remind us that monetary policy is\nmost effective when used as a counter-cyclical tool. That means providing policy\naccommodation when deteriorating economic conditions threaten price stability and\nemployment. Conversely, it means unwinding accommodation as we see economic\nconditions improve. In other words, the Fed should cut rates when the economy stumbles\nor contracts, and raise rates as the economy recovers and grows.\n\nThe Limits of Monetary Policy\nWhile monetary policy can be an effective counter-cyclical tool, it is by no means\na counter-structural tool. That is, monetary policy can work to smooth out some of the\nups and downs in economic activity, but can do little to push the trend rate of growth\nhigher. Any persistent attempts to do so will likely prove futile, as longer-run growth is\ndriven by real factors like population growth, productivity and the accumulation of\ncapital, both human capital from educational attainment and physical capital from\nbusiness investment.\nThe FOMC has acknowledged that economic conditions will likely warrant a\ngradual pace of policy adjustments. I support that approach. A gradual path allows us to\ntake into account various headwinds and risks faced by the economy, and to proceed in a\n\n7\n\n\fmanner that maintains policy settings that are—and will continue to be for some time—\nvery accommodative.\nWhile I view the gradual approach as appropriate, postponing the removal of\naccommodation when the economy is near full employment and inflation is rising toward\nthe 2 percent target could promote alternative risks that would decrease the likelihood of\nachieving our longer-run objectives. In the long run, a failure to keep interest rate policy\nin line with improving fundamentals can distort the allocation of capital toward less\nfruitful—or perhaps excessively risky—endeavors. Within the last two decades we have\nfaced episodes of accelerating equity prices, housing prices and, most recently,\ncommodity prices. Currently, commercial real estate markets, where prices have\ncontinued to drift higher, bear watching. When these types of imbalances tip, the entire\neconomy can face the consequences of their fallout, with some sectors and populations\nmore impacted than others. My concern for some time has been that extending monetary\npolicy too far beyond its scope of capability risks undesirable financial, economic and\npolitical distortions.\nIn the current environment, waiting to make additional adjustments to monetary\npolicy may seem costless in the face of benign inflation pressures. Some argue that we\nhave the ability to make more rapid adjustments later if inflation moves higher than\ncurrently projected. From a technical standpoint, it is true that the Fed has the ability to\nsteer short-term rates and could raise them quickly if needed. But such actions are likely\nto be costly, inducing financial market volatility and slowing economic activity.\nHistorically, rapid increases in interest rates end poorly, resulting in economic recessions.\n\n8\n\n\fConclusion\nStaying the course with a gradual path of policy normalization is warranted in my\nview. Removing accommodation in small doses is consistent with the economy’s\nfundamentals, keeps policy accommodative while global and domestic risks play out, and\ndoes not preclude pausing or responding if downside risks materialize.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Hoenig, presented to the FDIC Community\nBanker Conference, Arlington, VA\nApril 6, 2016\nIntroduction\nThe United States has a long history of economic success under a\ndecentralized and diversified banking system. Commercial banks, ranging in\nsize from small to very large, have successfully served the credit needs of\nindividuals, small businesses, and large international firms. This success was\nbased on a business model wherein the banker serves as a trusted\nintermediary between savers and borrowers. Using this model, the banking\nand financial industry created and supported the largest, most dynamic\neconomy in the world. But things have changed, and the community bank\nmodel has come under enormous competitive and operational pressure -- so\nmuch so that some are asking if the model is sustainable. In my view it is, but\nnot without some fresh thinking and concerted effort.\nConsolidation\nOver the past 30 years traditional community banks have become less\ninfluential as they have lost market share of credit allocation within the\neconomy and as their numbers continue to decline.\nThe consolidation of the credit channel within the United States in recent\ndecades has been dramatic.1 For example, in 1984 the distribution of assets\namong community, regional, and money center banks was nearly\nproportional, with more than 15,000 commercial banks serving a variety of\nborrowers, from consumers and small businesses to global conglomerates.\nToday, the 20 largest banks by assets control more than 80 percent of\nindustry assets, and the number of banking firms has declined to less than\n6,200. The group of community banks with less than $1 billion of assets,\n1\n\nConsolidation of the Credit Channel: https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/creditchannels.pdf\n\n\fwhich in 1984 controlled nearly a third of banking assets, today controls less\nthan 10 percent of industry assets.\nThese trends put us on a path toward a system in which a few very large\nfinancial firms control the allocation of credit within the national economy. It\nis unclear, to me at least, whether this structure in the longer term will\nsupport a vibrant, competitive system, able to serve the present and future\nneeds of consumers and business, or if it will become a highly concentrated,\ncontrolled distribution system for credit. At a minimum, therefore,\nconsolidation in the banking industry deserves attention regarding its effects\non competition and reduced consumer and business options.\nWhile any number of factors might contribute to consolidation, I would note\nat least four.\nFirst, branch banking laws were substantially liberalized. Where banks were\nonce confined to local or state boundaries, in the 1980s and ’90s state and\nfederal laws removed these barriers. While this change was inevitable and\nnecessary in an open economy, it also enabled and accelerated the banking\nindustry’s consolidation.\nSecond, activities insured banks are permitted to conduct -- including\ninsurance, investment banking, broker-dealer activities, and trading -- have\nsignificantly expanded, as codified in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.\nThe effect of this change has been to encourage and accelerate consolidation\namong the largest financial firms in the United States, both within the\nbanking industry and among the largest commercial and investment banks\nand some insurance companies. It has contributed to an enormous increase in\nthe concentration of the industry and an increase in the systemic risk facing\nour economic system.\nThird, monetary policy has sustained an interest rate environment near zero\nfor almost a decade. This has significantly affected the ability of community\nbanks to maintain net interest margins, manage risks, and achieve returns\nnecessary to operate safely and profitably. The result has been increasing\nnumbers of community banks exiting the industry and fewer investors\nseeking new charters.\n\n\fFinally, in recent decades there has been an obvious and significant increase\nin bank regulation and regulatory burden. Traditional community banks face\na compliance burden that seems disproportionate to their risk profile and\nsometimes unrelated to their activities. One effect is further industry\nconsolidation as small banks drive to reduce average overhead and\ncompliance costs using mergers to build assets. I want to focus the remainder\nof my remarks on this trend and how we might address it.\nRegulatory Relief for Traditional Banks\nTo mitigate some aspects of regulatory burden and provide greater flexibility\nto the majority of banks operating in the United States, I have suggested a\npath that focuses on bank activity, complexity, and funding sources. Such an\napproach is designed to provide regulatory relief that is meaningful for all\nbanks engaged in traditional commercial banking -- mostly community and\nsome regional banks -- without diminishing safety and soundness, or\nconsumer safety and access to service. The model I recommend is not\nmandatory and, importantly, it abandons the reference to size thresholds, with\ntheir confusing benchmarks and varied demands and exceptions that add\nconfusion and burden.\nFirst, I suggest defining a traditional bank eligible for regulatory relief as one\nthat:\n\n\n\nholds no trading assets or liabilities;\nholds no derivative positions other than interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives;\n\nhas total notional value of all its derivatives exposures -including cleared and non-cleared derivatives -- of less than $8\nbillion; and\n\nmaintains a ratio of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\ntangible equity-to-assets of at least 10 percent.\nA bank with sufficient capital that doesn’t engage in high-risk trading\nactivities and investment strategies with funding subsidized by the FDIC and\nthe Federal Reserve poses less of a risk to the financial system. Such an\n\n\finstitution should not face the same regulations and supervisory requirements\nthat apply to complex firms involved in both trading and traditional\ncommercial banking with lower levels of capital. Banks with at least 10\npercent equity capital have lower rates of failure and stable rates of lending\nover the course of an economic cycle2. In addition, and importantly, a\nmajority of commercial banks already meet the 10 percent equity capital\nlevel.\nDefining eligibility for regulatory relief around these specific criteria, rather\nthan asset size, reflects the longstanding business models of traditional\ncommercial banks. Doing so recognizes that many sources of regulatory\nburden have been put in place in reaction to the increasingly complex and\nrisky nature of the activities that some banks have chosen to pursue. Since\nthese criteria are objective and readily apparent from a bank’s balance sheet,\nthe eligibility requirements can be enforced relying on existing Call Report\nfields and the regular exam process.\nWith this framework in place, regulatory relief for traditional banks can be\nachievable. Some of the regulatory changes that are imminently reasonable\ninclude:\n\n\nexempting traditional banks from all Basel capital standards and\nassociated risk-weighted asset calculations;\n\nexempting these banks from several entire schedules on the Call\nReport;\n\nallowing for greater examiner discretion and eliminating\nrequirements to refer “all possible or apparent fair lending violations\nto Justice,” if judged to be minimal or inadvertent and where\nrestitution is voluntarily made;\n\nestablishing further criteria that would exempt eligible banks\nfrom appraisal requirements allowing them to prepare internal\nappraisals to be reviewed by examiners;\n\nexempting banks, if applicable, from stress testing requirements;\n2\n\nCapital and bank failure levels: https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/idichart.html\nCapital and bank lending levels: https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/lendingcharts.pdf\n\n\f\n\nadjusting the examination cycle for well-rated banks to 18months, from the current required 12-month cycle;\n\ndefining mortgages made and that remain in a bank’s portfolio as\nqualified mortgages for purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\nreducing certain reporting requirements for HMDA.\n\nCapital Strength\nThe 10 percent capital level I have recommended as one of the criteria for\nmeaningful regulatory relief, as I noted earlier, reflects a position from which\nbanks are less likely to fail and a position from which they can best hold\nloans and serve customers during even the most severe downturns. This\namount of owner equity, therefore, serves to assure the public that the bank is\nsoundly capitalized and deserves its confidence.\nIt also is worth noting that most community banks currently meet this capital\nrequirement and already would be eligible for relief under the framework I\nhave outlined. Almost 95 percent of banks meet the business model tests.\nMore than half meet the 10 percent capital requirement for eligibility, and 74\npercent are over 9 percent. Those that are not at 10 percent would be given\nimmediate relief if they commit to an 18-month phase-in period to reach 10\npercent.\nIn putting forward this framework, I recognize that it is not a cure-all. It will\nnot end consolidation caused by costs and other industry factors. However, it\ndoes address one source of cost for traditional banks, and it does so without\nweakening the overall strength and accountability of the sector. In addition, if\ncommunity and regional bankers have other specific areas of law or\nregulation that could reasonably be eased for traditional banks, I encourage\ntheir recommendations.\nAs a side note, I have been told that the industry cannot support this proposal\nbecause not all traditional banks have 10 percent equity. I find this position\nunsettling because most banks can in fact obtain this capital threshold\nthrough retained earnings and because such a position by the industry as a\nwhole effectively denies the majority of community banks significant\n\n\fregulatory relief. Remember, banks that choose not to meet the eligibility test\nI have suggested, because they prefer to operate with lower capital levels,\nmay continue to do so, but at the price of greater regulatory oversight and\ncompliance burden.\nAlternative Approaches\nThe framework I’ve outlined is a legislative remedy to address regulatory\nburden. Other avenues are also available, including the EGRPRA regulatory\nreview conducted every 10 years as mandated by the Economic Growth and\nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act and other legislative proposals such the\nTAILOR bill designed to streamline rules through the regulatory process.\nWhile I would encourage useful regulatory relief from any source, my point\nremains that to achieve meaningful and long-term regulatory relief, it is\nnecessary to change the statutes from which the burden flows. I would\nencourage the community banking industry to review this proposal with those\ngoals in mind.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn closing, I want to caution community bankers on one vital point.\nRegulatory relief is important, but by itself it will not save the community\nbank model. Many among you have told me that your model of relationship\nbanking, while strong, must adjust to the competition with its ever changing\nface and force. Attracting funds, developing loan products, and improving\npayments products is no longer a business unique to the banking industry.\nOther financial competitors are intensifying their efforts to capture your\nmarket, and community banks must adapt. While product platforms can be\noutsourced, products offered on those platforms must constantly be refreshed,\nwhich requires the community banking industry to apply its insights and\ninputs to improve its offerings.\nThe community banking industry, through its trade associations and other\nmeans, therefore must become ever more strategic and effective as it\ndevelops and delivers new products. Changes in technology are just one\nexample of how the community banking industry must work together, not\n\n\fonly to battle the challenges of the present but also to grasp the opportunities\nfor the future.\n###\nThe views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of the\nFDIC.\nThomas M.

            "content": "Remarks on Bank Supervision by FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig, presented to\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Conference on Supervising Large Complex\nFinancial Institutions – March 18, 2016\nIntroduction\nI want to thank Jamie McAndrew and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for this\nopportunity to speak on the subject of bank supervision. I approach the topic from the\nperspective of nearly four decades in various roles in bank supervision inside the Federal\nReserve System and now at the FDIC. I have had the dubious opportunity to respond to a host of\nfinancial crises, recessions, and problems at banks. While I cannot say that my experience is a\nsilver bullet in the quest for financial stability, it has given me a perspective on the role of bank\nsupervision in that pursuit. It also affords me an appreciation of the damage that can be done\nwhen supervisory policy is inadequate.\nGood supervision is a process. It involves setting financial standards, collecting and analyzing\ninformation, and ultimately applying judgment and demonstrating courage in conveying that\ninformation to financial firms and other market participants.\nWith that in mind, today I will share with you my views on three elements in assuring success\nwith this supervisory process.\nFirst, commercial banking firms of all sizes, including the largest, should be subject to full-scope\nexaminations. Second, because banks—especially the largest banks—have an outsized effect on\nthe economy, they should be required to disclose important supervisory findings that serve to\nbetter inform the public regarding their financial condition. Third, supervisors must recognize\ntheir limits and insist that banking firms hold sufficient capital to backstop management mistakes\nand simply bad luck.\nFull-Scope Exams\nA long-held and useful principle in bank supervision is that commercial banks should receive\nfull-scope examinations on a periodic basis. While smaller banks are examined in this systematic\nmanner, this is not the case for the largest banks. Instead, regulators rely upon continual on-site\nexaminer presence and limited, rotating targeted reviews to validate findings. Supervisors of\nthese firms have become overly reliant on bank models, model validation reviews, stress tests,\nand updates from bank management as a substitute for records review and hard questioning to\ndraw conclusions regarding a firm’s condition.\nFull-scope examinations delve into the quality of portfolios and their implications for long-term\nresilience. A full-scope exam is a point-in-time analysis of a bank’s full balance-sheet quality\nand management competence. It includes the models and material provided by the banks that\ncurrently are used in exams, but a full-scope exam also involves reviewing and testing asset\nquality using accepted examination standards. In such an exam, examiners pull ledgers, review\nloans, and systematically review a cross-section of bank portfolios. These examinations focus on\nidentifying a firm’s risk profile and lapses in risk management practices. They include point-in-\n\n\ftime analysis across the entire balance sheet of assets, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to\nmarket risk.\nThe full-scope exam process aggregates and analyzes bank data, thereby providing a thorough\nsupervisory picture of individual institutions, in addition to enabling supervisors to better\nidentify emerging risks and trends in the banking industry.\nFull-scope examinations better use on-site staff as they are subsumed within the greater\nexamination process, helping provide a deeper understanding of bank conditions, leadership, and\nperformance.\nOver time, as economists have come to play a greater role in the supervision of large firms, they\nhave revealed a preference for relying on models—either their own or the firm’s—to judge a\nbank’s condition. Such reviews can be enormously helpful, but they would be most effective if\nused in conjunction with a full-scope exam and the systematic evaluation of exam results.\nFocusing almost exclusively on models handicaps regulators to information and signals outside\nthe model. Crises inevitably are instigated by events generated outside the assumptions and\nvariables wrapped within these carefully constructed models; by unpredictable factors that by\ndefinition are impossible to include in models.\nEffective supervision requires an objective review, which is difficult to maintain for embedded\nanalysts who are practiced in reviewing management-presented material and reports. This too\noften becomes a self-assessment exercise that provides limited independent insight into the\nworkings and risk profile of the largest firms.\nCommissioned examiners who rotate among banks and pull different bank ledgers and review\nloans develop a fuller understanding of the portfolio. Combined with the results of stress tests,\nthis systematic approach allows supervisors to develop a comprehensive basis for judging bank\nsoundness. The knowledge and skills of a commissioned examiner are distinct from those of an\neconomist or a statistician. On-site staff, without broader information sources, develop a more\ninsular perspective of a bank that makes it harder to identify excessive risks and poor risk\nmanagement processes that are firm specific.\nFinally, it’s important to mention that the role of the examiner should be limited. The examiner is\nnot there to judge, approve, or identify with management decisions, as sometimes can happen\nwith on-site examiners. 1\nSampling and Bank Examination\nIt is somewhat misleading to assume that it would take an army of examiners to review the\nlargest banks in a manner equivalent to that of a community bank. Sampling across a bank’s\n\n1\n\nAn International Review of OCC’s Supervision of Large and Midsize Institutions: Recommendations to Improve\nSupervisory Effectiveness: http://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2013/nr-occ-2013-184a.pdf\n\n\fportfolio can provide a sound means to judge balance sheet quality. Statisticians have longstanding sampling methodologies for determining the soundness of assets, at an affordable cost.\nSampling is used, for example, during narrowly defined bank reviews, such as the Shared\nNational Credit (SNC) program. Under the SNC program, examiners pull a series of significant\ncredits held among the largest banks and rate the credits based on performance, quality of\nunderwriting, and risk profile of the borrower. The exams provide important insight into the\nquality of the asset portfolio, the overall credit culture of the bank, and the quality of its\nmanagement. Both supervisors and management gain useful perspective on where future\nproblems for this category of assets might arise in a downturn. In instances where underwriting is\nweak, remedial actions are required to strengthen the portfolio and perhaps avoid future losses.\nUsing statistical sampling, a broad portfolio of loans and other assets from across the firm would\nbe pulled. The equivalent of a full-scope review for the largest firms could be accomplished\nusing techniques comparable to those used in the SNC program. Within this framework, the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and other complementary analyses also\nwould be incorporated, providing a unique insight into the risk profile of these systemically\nimportant firms.\nThe banking agencies devote enormous resources to reviewing models, developing models, and\nstress testing the largest firms. Some of these resources might more productive if they were\ndevoted to examining firms in a systematic, full-scope manner. Once developed, such exams\nwould provide a much-needed assessment of a bank’s asset quality, liquidity, operations, and\ncontrols. Only then can we accurately judge the bank’s risk profile, balance-sheet strength, and\nmanagement.\nDisclosure and Transparency\nThe largest banking firms have a disproportional effect on the economy and receive public\nsupport. Therefore, it is appropriate that they be highly transparent. Early disclosure of findings\nabout the condition of a bank is an essential prerequisite for effective market discipline. This\nneed increases as banks and financial products become more complex and, in many ways, more\nopaque.\nRegulators can help improve bank transparency by assuring that valid information is brought\nforward, not only to bank management but also to the market. Regulators also should consider\nrequiring banks to disclose significant or material findings, which could include examiner\nconcerns about weak control systems or credit review programs. The disclosure of examination\nfindings represents a natural outgrowth of the examination process that would help provide\ngreater consistency to the balance-sheet, income statement, and related information publicly\ntraded banks already disclose under SEC regulations. Such disclosure could be made by bank\nmanagement with their explanations and plans to address such findings, after the examining\nagency reviewed the disclosure for accuracy.\nSuch disclosures would impose market discipline at an earlier stage, which would likely make\nbanks more accountable for their risk choices and help limit the severity of problems identified\n\n\fby examiners. Additionally, enhanced disclosures would hold supervisors accountable and\ninhibit their being captured by firms.\nI recognize that there is concern that disclosing supervisory information would be destabilizing\nfor banks experiencing difficultly. I would agree that bank ratings should not be disclosed, as this\nwould make supervisors rating agencies, which they are not. Beyond this, however, I believe the\nfear of disclosing findings is misplaced. Disclosure, especially early disclosure, is the best cure\nfor unanticipated crises. It seems that the market already recognizes the absence of full\ndisclosure by the largest firms, as evidenced by the fact that many are trading below their book\nvalues.\nCapital Matters\nFinally, an integral part of the supervisory process is insisting on strong capital. The purpose of\nbank supervision is to verify that banks are operating soundly and to assure that noted\nweaknesses are addressed. No supervision program can, should, or is intended to shield firms\nfrom the consequences of failed business decisions, even those that appeared reasonable at the\ntime. That is the role of ownership capital.\nThe question, then, is: What level of ownership capital is sufficient? The largest banking firms\ninsist that they are well capitalized, but data and evidence suggest that this is not the case. In an\napples-to-apples comparison, it is striking that the largest firms are the least well capitalized of\nany group of banks operating in the United States. 2\nCapital adequacy is judged using a number of risk-based measures. One, using internal models,\nadjusts capital of the largest banks to 13 percent of assets or higher. But this is capital against\nrisk-weighted assets, which are only about 40 percent of total assets. No other industry is\nallowed to remove 60 percent of its assets when its financial condition is assessed. I do not\nbelieve it’s an accident that these risk-based standards have increased in importance and\ncomplexity as supervisors have moved away from full-scope exams. Instead of relying on strong\nexaminations to address risk concentrations, regulators have relied on risk-based capital rules.\nA more dependable measure of capital is the tangible leverage ratio, based on International\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This measure, which market investors rely on, shows that\nU.S. G-SIBs have a tangible capital ratio of only 5.73 percent and foreign G-SIBs have 5.13\npercent.\nTo appreciate the significance of these percentages, compare them to the conservative estimates\nof bank losses in the 2008 crisis which show the industry lost approximately 7 percent of assets.\nLeverage ratios currently around 5 percent might boost ROE to individual firms and facilitate\ngrowth of economies during boom times, but they provide virtually no sustainability during\ndownturns nor enough margin for inevitable errors by even the best bank managers or simply\nfrom bad luck.\n2\n\nGlobal Capital Index: https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/capitalizationratio2015-2.pdf\n\n\fIt has been suggested that using the more strict leverage ratio as the principal measure of capital\nadequacy would cause loan and economic growth to slow. Incongruously, it is also argued that\ndemanding capital would cause bankers to take on greater risks to boost returns. Research on\nthese topics, however, suggests otherwise. Going into the crisis of 2008, banks holding an\naverage 12 percent capital saw more modest declines in loans and a quicker recovery. In\ncontrast, banks with capital below 8 percent, including the largest banks, experienced more\ndramatic declines in lending. Strong capital levels support growth over the business cycle and are\ngood for the economy.\nFrom a supervision program perspective, moving away from risk-based capital measures toward\nan assessment of adequacy based on tangible equity would generate more reliable information\nfrom which to make supervisory judgments and would free up billions of dollars from\nsupervision budgets currently spent waiting for, understanding, and implementing risk-based\nmeasures. Risk-based capital models do have an appropriate role as a component of the\nsupervision process for stress testing different scenarios, but the extension of their use to judge\nbank health is misleading. The leverage ratio—which the market uses to access banks, as seen by\nthe price-to-book ratios of the largest firms—in combination with strong examinations is the\nonly real way to ensure firms have sufficient capital and to enhance stability.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe process of bank supervision is demanding. Extensive data collection and analysis are\nrequired. Asset and liability portfolios must be tested. Operations and related controls must be\nunderstood and tested, and the quality of management must be judged. Supervision requires an\nappreciation of the best balance of transparency and confidentiality, especially as it might\ninvolve disclosure of some examination findings. Finally, capital standards —so necessary to the\nresiliency of individual firms and the industry—must be determined and enforced.\nThe keystone on which the usefulness of these principles rests is the willingness of supervisors to\ndo their job, which includes operating with healthy skepticism and asking tough questions.\nImportantly, it also includes the responsibility and courage to convey their findings to bank\nmanagement – even in an environment of growth, when it is often easier to accept the prevailing\nview. But within reasonable bounds, it is the supervisors’ responsibility to swim against the tide\nof enthusiasm. In 2006 and 2007 there were clear signs that problems were surfacing, and yet\nsupervisors were slow to act. Even when guidance was issued about commercial real estate, the\nagencies quickly backed down after the industry raised objections. In hindsight, the regulators\nwere correct in their projections, and the only mistake was in backing down.\nMore serious perhaps was that the agencies appeared to have actually joined the chorus of “this\ntime it’s different,” judging from the absence of any supervisory actions against some of the\nworld’s largest and most complex firms and the decision to cut back on systematic examinations\nin the years leading up to 2008. All the exam findings in the world and all the model warning\nsignals are of little use if leaders of the regulatory bodies fail to carry the message forward.\nI will close by referring to the book that is in each of your packets. “Integrity, Fairness and\nResolve” is a biography of one examiner, Bill Taylor, who headed up the Fed’s Division of Bank\n\n\fSupervision and then was chairman of the FDIC. Bill taught that good supervision requires\ninformation gathering and validation, experience, and true courage. He exemplifies that one\nleader can make a difference; that one bank examiner with these characteristics can make an\nindustry and an economy more resilient.\n###\nThe views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of the FDIC.\nThomas M.

The Kansas City Fed has\nhad a long and productive relationship with the Central Exchange and I always enjoy the\nopportunity to join you.\nLast week, I participated in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting where\nthe Committee decided to hold steady its target interest rate. I supported this decision and, in my\nremarks this afternoon, I will share my views on the economic outlook and monetary policy.\nBefore we continue, I need to tell you that these comments represent my views and are\nnot necessarily reflective of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe U.S. Outlook\nSince the end of the financial crisis, the U.S. economy has grown annually by about 2\npercent and labor markets have made large strides toward healing. As a longer-term comparison,\nwe are now in the fifth-longest expansion in recorded U.S. history. Inflation has also remained\nlow and stable. While there are always uncertainties about how the economy will perform in the\nfuture, it’s worth reflecting on the past and acknowledging the progress that has been made.\nRight now, I view the economy as being in a good spot, but I will also discuss some risks I am\nkeeping in mind.\nTurning first to recent data, economic growth slowed a bit toward the end of last year,\nthough overall growth in 2015 was not too different than the past few years. Some of the softness\nreflected fewer exports and a modest step-down in the level of business investment in new\nstructures and equipment. Other factors, like inventory adjustments, also lowered the growth\nestimate.\n\n1\n\n\fWhile a single quarter of slower growth is important to watch, I take reassurance that the\neconomy remains on track due to strong job gains. In fact, job gains actually picked up toward\nthe end of last year. Looking at longer trends, employment growth has been quite strong over the\npast few years. More jobs were added in both 2014 and 2015 than in any year since the late\n1990s.\nAt the same time, demographic changes are affecting the labor market outlook. For\nexample, U.S. population growth is slowing, which indicates not as many jobs need to be created\nas in the past to absorb new entrants into the labor force. As a result, I expect to see employment\ngrowth slow from its recent pace and would not interpret a modest slowdown as a sign of trouble\nin the economy.\nOverall, I see job gains as underpinning stronger consumer demand for goods and\nservices. Low gasoline prices and signs of faster wage growth should also add to consumers’\nability to increase spending. And although financial markets have been volatile, household\nwealth remains at a high level, and house prices have been rising over the past four years.\nCertainly, the gains in jobs, wages and wealth have not been equally shared across households\nduring the recovery, but overall, the general health of households’ financial situations is much\nimproved since the financial crisis.\nEven as households and consumers are doing better, some sectors of the economy are\nfacing headwinds. I mentioned earlier low gasoline prices, which of course reflect low oil prices.\nBecause the energy sector is such an important part of the Kansas City Fed’s regional economy,\nwe monitor these developments closely. We know lower oil prices benefit consumers, but also\nweigh on oil producers. We have certainly seen energy-intensive states affected. For example,\n\n2\n\n\fwe are seeing more people every week filing claims for unemployment insurance in Oklahoma\nthan was the case a few years ago.\nJust as developments in the energy sector bear watching, so do challenges facing the\nmanufacturing sector. The rise in the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar, for example, has\nresulted in lower orders from abroad for many of our exporters. In addition, foreign growth in\nsome parts of the world has been uneven and slowing, which has affected foreign demand for\nsome U.S. goods. Despite these headwinds, the U.S. economy has proven itself to be resilient to\na wide range of shocks in recent years, including sluggish growth abroad.\nFinally, inflation has remained muted as a result of lower oil prices and the strong U.S.\ndollar. Recent movements in each of these have been quite large by historical standards. Yet,\ndespite these headwinds, core measures of inflation have recently risen on a year-over-year basis.\nAnd although inflation rates over the past few years have hovered below the Fed’s goal of 2\npercent, they have been positive and broadly consistent with price stability.\n\nRisks to the Outlook\nOutlooks are subject to change, and forecasts are imperfect predictions of the future. As\na result, those, like me, who rely on forecasts, must think about what could go wrong and how\nincoming data might affect the outlook for the economy. Gauging whether a temporary\nslowdown in growth, financial market volatility or foreign developments is a harbinger of\nweaker growth or a reflection of temporary factors, can be difficult and often requires assessing\nbroader trends and risks.\nRight now, I view the U.S. economy as in a generally good position. However, a few\ndevelopments bear watching. I mentioned the energy sector. We are certainly paying attention to\n\n3\n\n\fany spillovers that energy job losses may have on the broader economy. Elevated inventories in\nsome sectors also pose a risk to the extent that manufacturing production slows further to better\nalign current inventory levels with final sales and shipments of goods. Finally, global growth is\ncommonly pointed to as a risk. While I wouldn’t discount recent developments abroad, I also\nnote that many forecasts point to a modestly stronger foreign outlook this year than in 2015. Still,\nsome emerging markets carry substantial debt, so a crisis in one area can transmit to others. But\ndespite these concerns, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy currently appear strong enough to\nsustain positive growth going forward.\n\nThe Path for Monetary Policy\nTurning to monetary policy, for seven years, the FOMC maintained near-zero interest\nrates and undertook a series of large-scale asset purchase programs — a policy stance responding\nto a historic financial and economic emergency in 2008. Accordingly, the FOMC’s decision to\nalter that policy stance in December garnered a great deal of attention when the benchmark\ninterest rate was increased by 25 basis points. I supported this decision, although I viewed it as a\nlate start to what is likely to be a gradual path toward normalizing interest rates.\nAfter such a prolonged period of low rates, the FOMC is understandably cautious.\nMoving rates gradually may avoid unnecessarily jolting the economy or causing excessive\nfinancial market volatility. Even looking at developments so far this year, financial markets have\nbeen quite volatile. While taking a signal from such volatility is warranted, monetary policy\ncannot respond to every blip in financial markets. Instead, a focus on economic fundamentals,\nsuch as labor markets and inflation, can help guard against monetary policy over- or underreacting to swings in financial conditions. To a great extent, the recent bout of volatility is not all\n\n4\n\n\fthat unexpected, nor necessarily worrisome, given that the Fed’s low interest rate and bondbuying policies focused on boosting asset prices as a means of stimulating the real economy. As\nasset prices adjust to the shift in monetary policy, it is to be expected that the pricing of risk will\nrealign to this different rate environment.\nOverall, it is important to remember that even after this first rate hike, monetary policy\nremains highly accommodative. Real interest rates continue to be negative and the Federal\nReserve’s large portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities keeps downward pressure\non longer-term rates.\nIn communicating its intentions for further rate increases, the Committee has noted that it\nexpects economic conditions will warrant only gradual increases in the fed funds rate, although\nadjustments ultimately depend on the incoming data. My own view is that a pickup in economic\ngrowth, steady job gains and modestly higher core rates of inflation will warrant further\nincreases.\nThe exact timing of each move, however, is subject to the economic environment.\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with lags, decisions must necessarily rely on\nforecasts and their associated risks — not waiting until desired objectives are realized.\nIf we wait for the data to provide complete confirmation before making a policy decision,\nwe may well have waited too long. Likewise, policy may be faced with altering its trajectory if\nthe economy’s progress points to a different outlook. But in the absence of any substantial shift\nin the outlook, my view is that the Committee should continue the gradual adjustment of moving\nrates higher to keep them aligned with economic activity and inflation. These actions are often\ndifficult, but also necessary to keep growth in line with the economy’s long-run potential and to\nfoster price stability.\n\n5\n\n\fInstitutional Challenges\nAs the Federal Reserve contemplates the appropriate path of normalizing its monetary\npolicy, it naturally does so with considerable public attention. One source of this attention\ncomes from Congress itself. Calls for legislative reforms of the Federal Reserve have persisted\nover the past five years, ranging from its structure and governance to its monetary policy\napproach and decision making. Additionally, Congress has shown its willingness to tap the\nFederal Reserve to fund fiscal activities ranging from new government agencies to highway\nconstruction.\nI understand that Fed actions during the crisis have raised a number of questions about\nthe institution and its scope. When Congress established the Federal Reserve more than a century\nago, it designed the institution to be apolitical but with accountability to Congress. This construct\nwas designed to protect the stewards of the nation’s money supply from the vulnerabilities\nassociated with short-term political agendas. It includes important checks and balances that are\noften misunderstood, but nonetheless critical to the functioning of the institution.\nDuring my 33 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the primary focus of\nthousands of dedicated Federal Reserve employees has been the health of the economy,\nsupported by an efficient and accessible banking and payments system. To the extent that there is\nany doubt in the minds of Congress or the public about this, it is incumbent on the Federal\nReserve to work with Congress in a direct and transparent way until we satisfy any remaining\nquestions about the execution of our mission. Such dialogue would provide the highest\nprobability for outcomes that best serve the public interest.\nIn that spirit, I look forward to 2016 and the promise it holds.\n\n6\n\n\f"

            "content": "“The Relative Role of Debt in Bank Resiliency and Resolvability”- Remarks by FDIC Vice\nChairman Thomas M. Hoenig. Presented to the Peterson Institute for International Economics,\nWashington, DC.\n\nJanuary 20, 2016\n\nIntroduction\nIn the bankruptcy reorganization of a failed commercial business, the conversion of debt into\nequity or some revised debt instrument is often the protocol. This has long proven useful in\ntransitioning a failed business back into a productive enterprise. However, mandating increased\nlevels of debt as part of a broad, prescribed resolution strategy has potential effects that,\nparadoxically, may undermine the very financial stability being sought.\nThis may be the case with TLAC. Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, as set out by the Financial\nStability Board, requires large, interconnected banking firms to hold certain levels of long-term\ndebt.1 Its intention is laudable: to improve the resolvability of banking firms to assure that,\nshould they fail, they can be resolved without turning to the taxpayer for help. The proposed U.S.\nversion of TLAC would require global systemically important banks (GSIBs) to maintain TLACrelated debt at the holding company with restrictions on ownership.2 However, in many\ninstances, to meet the proposal’s goals, firms would have to not only maintain current levels of\ndebt, but also would have to add debt to their balance sheets.\nIn my remarks today, I will highlight TLAC’s effects and suggest that it be used in a more\nlimited and discretionary manner. I will suggest that its use depend on a bank's business model\nand Title I resolution plan. Such an approach would acknowledge that not all business models\n\n1\n\nhttp://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/20151106-TLAC-Press-Release.pdf\n\n2\n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20151030a.htm\n\n\fare the same and that different resolution strategies might work better for different financial\nfirms -- and for financial stability.\nResolution Planning and SPOE\nTLAC is a necessary component of the single point of entry (SPOE) resolution strategy that has\nbeen proposed but not yet adopted in the United States.3 It therefore is difficult to discuss TLAC\nwithout first describing SPOE.\nThe FDIC initially proposed SPOE to facilitate an orderly resolution of a failed financial\ninstitution under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under SPOE, only the top-tier bank holding\ncompany of the failed firm would be put into receivership. In theory, the parent firm would have\nenough long-term debt to both absorb any remaining losses after equity is depleted and to\nrecapitalize subsidiaries so that they could remain well-capitalized and continue operations under\na new holding company. The presumption is that this would all be accomplished without\ncausing overwhelming panic and necessitating additional government intervention.\nSince SPOE was first discussed, the concept has migrated and become the principal bankruptcy\nplan under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act for all but two of eight U.S. GSIBs.4 The basic theory\nof SPOE in a bankruptcy reorganization is the same as for SPOE in a FDIC Title II receivership.\nIn this instance, the financial institution would go through bankruptcy without the critical\noperating subsidiaries themselves becoming insolvent or requiring government support. These\noperating units could include subsidiary insured banks, broker-dealers, and asset managers.\nResolution Planning and TLAC\nA successful SPOE resolution, under Title I or Title II, assumes sufficient internal long-term debt\nthat can convert to equity in order to effectively recapitalize operating subsidiaries of the holding\ncompany following its failure. The Federal Reserve’s TLAC proposal further specifies that a\nclean holding company, with this long-term debt, is required in order to remove obstacles “to the\norderly SPOE resolution” of a financial institution. In short, the TLAC proposal is designed to\nrequire a firm to have sufficient long-term debt to facilitate a SPOE solution both through\nconversion of current debt and, if need be, added debt.\nAccording to the estimates in the proposal, the GSIBs would have a combined long-term debt\nrequirement of approximately $680 billion. Existing debt issuance would cover much of this\namount, but the proposal estimates that there is a shortfall of approximately $100 billion.\n3\n\nhttp://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-12-18/pdf/2013-30057.pdf. As of this date, the FDIC has not\nadopted this strategy.\n4\nPublic versions of the resolution plans are available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/resolution-plans.htm.\n\n\fRoughly half of this projected debt shortfall would be met through issuing new debt to replace\n“near-eligible” debt. The remaining half of the shortfall could, according to the proposal, “then\nbe filled through the issuance of eligible external [long-term debt] in the place of existing\ndeposits or other lower-cost liabilities.” The impact section of the proposal concludes by noting\nthat the aggregate increase in cost of funding, which would come directly out of bank earnings,\nwould be in the range of $680 million to $1.5 billion annually.\nOther estimates find similar results, and firm-specific estimates are quite revealing. For\nexample, Credit Sights findings “estimate that Wells Fargo has the biggest shortfall at $46\nbillion, with JPMorgan a distant second at $19 billion, followed by Citigroup at $14 billion,\nBank of America at $6 billion and State Street at $2 billion.”5\nThe proposal affects firms in other ways as well. For example, Wells Fargo and Bank of New\nYork-Mellon do not have large broker-dealers and have not adopted a SPOE resolution strategy\nin their Title I plans6. In the second round of reviews of the resolution plans, regulators\ndetermined that Wells Fargo had the makings of a credible plan, but under the proposed TLAC\nrule, the company would have to issue additional long-term debt because its current levels are\ninsufficient to meet the TLAC standard.7 The effect, of course, is to encourage them to adopt a\nSPOE resolution strategy. Also noteworthy, and ironic, is that the former investment banks in\ngeneral have TLAC surpluses, as they are more reliant on debt funding than deposit funding.\nTLAC, as it is applied broadly to the industry, would necessarily affect leverage and in some\ninstances place pressure on firms to change their business model. In doing so, it also would\nencourage the industry and firms to add risks that may be inconsistent with conventional safety\nand soundness principles or what they would otherwise pursue. As firms issue large amounts of\nadditional, and more expensive, long-term debt and increase their leverage position, such funds\nmust earn commensurately higher returns to meet debt service and avoid default. Such\nrequirements may encourage banks to acquire higher-yielding and higher-risk assets, or expand\ninto non-bank activities, such as broker-dealer operations.8,9\n\n5\n\nhttps://www.creditsights.com/id/184763\n\n6\n\nPublic versions of the resolution plans of Wells Fargo and Bank of New York-Mellon:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/resolution-plans/wells-fargo-2g-20150701.pdf and\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/resolution-plans/bk-ny-mellon-3g-20150701.pdf\n7\n\n8\n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20141125a.htm\n\nThis argument is often offered as a case against requiring more equity. However, equity is far less\ndemanding on earnings, dividends and cash flow than fixed debt payments, especially under stress.\n\n\fAlso, while authorities might prefer that firms swap out debt instruments, reduce deposits, or\nissue additional capital to maintain existing levels of leverage, the companies are likely to\nattempt to increase leverage to meet added earning demands and maintain returns.10\nAdditionally, in a future recession, if earnings become insufficient to make holding company\ndebt payments (a likely outcome), then regulators would face the prospect of having to allow the\ntransfer of resources out of the bank to avoid default on holding company debt. Remember also\nthat unlike dividends, there can be no suspension of debt interest payments. These outcomes\nwould likely weaken the bank and would seem to undermine the principle that the holding\ncompany should be a source of strength for the insured bank.\nTo appreciate the potential effects that TLAC might have, it is useful to look at the history of\ntrust-preferred securities (TRuPS) at banks prior to the last crisis. At that time, regulators\npermitted firms to issue these instruments at the holding company and to include them as part of\ntheir capital. Although TRuPS are essentially long-term debt instruments, it was argued that they\nwould be available to help absorb losses in a crisis, relieving the firms from having to hold\nequity. As the crisis unfolded, the weaknesses of TRuPS revealed themselves as firms often had\nto remove resources from the operating banks in an effort to move cash to the holding company\nand avoid default. TRuPS placed significant pressures on insured banks to continue making\nlarge debt-service payments which most certainly exacerbated losses to the banking system. As\nit turns out, Congress wisely eliminated the use of these instruments as part of industry capital\nwhen it passed Dodd-Frank.\nFinally, the TLAC proposal, while increasing leverage, offers no assurance that the amount of\ndebt required would prove sufficient to avoid a failure or panic. There is currently a debate\nabout how much TLAC is enough to both absorb losses after equity is extinguished and also\nprovide enough additional equity to assure the operating subsidiaries are well capitalized. The\ngreater the possible losses, the greater amount of TLAC required, and of course firms want to\nhold less TLAC while some regulators judge the need for more.\nThus, a blanket rule mandating TLAC -- which requires financial firms to issue substantial\nadditional debt and which increases the leverage in an already highly-leveraged industry -should only be embraced with great reluctance. The long-term debt requirement would place\nadded earnings demands on the banking system and could be counter-productive, especially\nduring a period of financial stress.\n\n9\n\nThere is already some evidence that Wells Fargo is beginning to expand its investment banking\nactivities: http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-warms-up-to-risk-1428877356.\n10\n\nSee FT, January 14, 2016, \"Basel Committee softens new rules on bank capital,\" Laura Noonan, Mark\nArnold and Caroline Binham.\n\n\fBoth regulatory and banking professionals should be extremely cautious in this regard as it is\nparadoxical to suggest that the best way to manage the effects of excess leverage and financial\nvulnerability is to require more leverage, potentially raising financial vulnerability. At a\nminimum, a guiding principle for TLAC when addressing the question of resolution should be\nthat it have a neutral effect on the leverage position of the firm and the industry.\nAlternatives Solutions\nTLAC is closely tied to a SPOE resolution strategy to manage the failure of a GSIB. But there\nare other strategies that might also work and be less reliant on debt For example, in the U.S. an\nalternative strategy for certain banking firms could be a bridge bank in which the FDIC is\nappointed receiver of the insured depository institution while the holding company, and possibly\nsome of its other subsidiaries, declare bankruptcy. The FDIC would place some assets and\nliabilities of the old bank in the receivership (bad bank) and the rest in the new bridge bank\n(good bank). This strategy would allow the critical operations of the bank to continue following\nfailure, as the FDIC or its designee operates the bank until it is wound down, sold, or spun-off in\naccordance with the least cost to the taxpayer requirements. This solution could require less debt\nor may encourage more equity, depending on a host of factors. The point is that a one-size-fitsall solution is not necessarily the best outcome for the industry or the public.\nThe TLAC proposal would apply to GSIBs with little differentiation among them. Long-term\ndebt dominates the proposal and very little allowance is given for equity held on the balance\nsheet. This seems short-sighted, since greater amounts of equity increase liquidity and reduce\nthe likelihood of failure. Therefore, there might be the opportunity to reduce the long-term debt\nrequirement based on the firm’s resolution strategy and reliance on equity and debt for funding.\nWhat this suggests ultimately is that the Title I resolution planning process should be the sole\nmechanism to define the resources and mechanism necessary to assure resolution without public\nsupport. Each firm and its regulators should identify debt and equity requirements that have a\nneutral effect on the firm and the industry’s leverage positions, while also allowing for\nbankruptcy without public support should a firm fail. The process also could be used as the\nplanning tool should, for whatever reason, Title II be the ultimate resolution outcome.\nI would argue that such an approach is more judicious than requiring a sweeping TLAC rule.\nUnder Dodd-Frank, each Title I plan is prepared in detail by management and reviewed and\napproved by supervisors. Each living will is intended to be based on the specific business model\nof each firm and the bankruptcy strategy that would work best for that firm. Thus, instead of\napplying a blanket long-term debt requirement to facilitate one resolution strategy, regulators\ncould use the existing Title I planning process to tailor long-term debt levels to a firm's business\nmodel, capital structure, and resolution strategy, better assuring a private sector resolution should\nit be needed. And finally, as I have long urged, each firm’s Title I plan, particularly its reliance\n\n\fon debt versus equity within the plan, should be made public, as this would enhance the market’s\nrole in assuring the right balance within the plans.\nConclusion\nIn bankruptcy, the conversion of standard debt is often part of workable reorganization strategy.\nBut banking authorities should be cautious before demanding increased levels of debt for\nindividual banking firms or encouraging an increase in the effective leverage of an industry.\nIt is difficult to accept that more leverage solves the destabilizing problem of leverage. If\nadditional debt is useful to a specific firm, the amount should be determined on a firm-by-firm\nbasis as part of the living will program, with the balance between debt and equity carefully\njudged. During this process, banking companies would have to show that debt could be\nsuccessfully used in bankruptcy without weakening balance sheets or ultimately costing the\ntaxpayer money to resolve a failure.\nAdding leverage to the banking system in the hope that this will prove to be stabilizing is a\ngamble. There is considerable evidence that strategies that encourage increasing leverage within\nthe banking industry have in past crises only exacerbated losses. The goal is resilience and, if\nnecessary, resolution without government or taxpayer assistance. That is best achieved not by\nincreasing leverage, but by requiring the right balance of debt and added equity for each firm and\nthe industry as a whole.\n###\nThe views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of the FDIC.\nThomas M.

            "content": "“Post-Crisis Risks and Bank Equity Capital” -- Remarks by FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas\nM. Hoenig, presented to the 18th Annual International Banking Conference at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago\n\nNovember 5, 2015\nIt has been a rugged decade for the global economy, its financial firms, and their\nregulators. The economy has experienced crisis, followed by bail-outs, followed by thousands of\npages of laws and regulations designed to address the deficiencies. However, for all this activity,\npeople remain highly uncertain about what to expect from our economic institutions in the\ndecade ahead. The dimensions of this uncertainty ultimately will depend on the choices and\nstandards of performance demanded of those institutions today. It is with this in mind that I want\nto discuss one such standard -- the role of capital -- in the context of the conference theme: the\nfuture of large, internationally active banks.\nI acknowledge that progress has been made in strengthening our financial institutions.\nCapital and liquidity positions of large banking organizations have improved since the crisis. I\nalso acknowledge that stronger rules and more demanding regulators have played a role in\nachieving this improvement. Nevertheless, progress has been modest at best, and with the rich\nincentives that come from the safety net, there is constant pressure to compromise boundaries\nintended to strengthen the system. An example of the important decisions pending in the\ninternational arena is the Basel Committee’s announced intention to review the calibration of its\nleverage ratio framework, after only recently recognizing its importance. My message, therefore,\nis that while there has been progress improving capital, much remains undone and there is no\nplace for complacency regarding the stability of our financial system.\n\n1\n\n\fTwo Regulatory Options: Risk Prediction or Equity Capital\nTo begin, global banks are not as well capitalized as some within the industry would have\nyou believe. The fact is they remain highly leveraged and highly complicated, and should one\nfail, it would have systemic, destabilizing consequences. There are two different ways to\naddress these concerns. One would require detailed rules to control firms’ behaviors, structure\ntheir balance sheets, and direct their activities. The latest example is the Federal Reserve’s\nminimum debt proposal, recently put out for discussion, that would require firms to issue\nadditional long-term debt that would turn to equity when needed in order to increase their “total\nloss-absorbing capacity.” But it is costly to service this debt, putting earnings pressure on firms\nand their units that – all else being equal – could accelerate failure should an institution run into\nfinancial trouble. This goes to the core of our discussion about the fundamental need for equity,\nversus debt, to make a financial system strong. A question we must ask, then, is whether the\neffect of such a requirement that is designed to make a firm more resolvable once that firm has\nfailed, could -- prior to failure -- increase the firm’s leverage and thereby its likelihood to default.\nOur goal to prevent failure should be every bit as important as resolving failed firms.\nThe other way to promote stability would be to simply demand more equity capital to\nenable banking firms to better withstand a crisis, while allowing them to run their businesses\nwith less government direction.\nThe first option would require regulators to predict what activities and investments might\ncause future crises. It also would require them to calibrate rules in a manner that wouldn’t give\nrise to subsequent crises. In other words, regulators would have to successfully anticipate the\n\n2\n\n\fsource of future crises, which as you know could arise from a number of activities, but mostly\nlikely will come from something we fail to predict.\nThe second approach is based on equity capital and thus would not require such\nextraordinary insight from regulators. By design, it acknowledges that regulators cannot predict\nevents and it ensures a safer system because well capitalized institutions are better able to\nwithstand shocks and survive crises. Using simple leverage measures instead of risk-based\ncapital measures eliminates relying on the best guesses of financial regulators to guide decisions.\nEver-Changing Sources of Risk\nBank balance sheets today hold a range of assets that are unavoidably more sensitive to\nchanges in interest rates than even just prior to the crisis. The near-zero short term interest rates\nof the post-crisis period have boosted the value of stocks and bonds, and they have encouraged\nincreased leverage through low-cost borrowing at extended maturities. For example, the average\nmaturity of newly issued corporate bonds is approaching 15 years, according to SIFMA data.\nWhat zero interest rates give, rising interest rates can take away. Bond arithmetic tells us\nthat the value of many long maturity, low coupon fixed income bonds issued in recent years can\nbe expected to decline sharply in response to increases in interest rates or credit spreads, or just\nthe expectations of such changes. Experience also tells us that additional risk can come from\nunpredictable flash events of heightened volatility for those financial assets that are\nelectronically traded and at high speed.\nWhile financial institutions are used to dealing with changes in interest rates, keeping\nthem artificially at the zero bound for so long changes the calculus of this risk. The volume of\nfixed income obligations in the system, whose value is highly sensitive to interest rates, is large\n3\n\n\fand growing. For the largest banks, unrealized losses on available for-sale securities will be\npassed through to regulatory capital, appropriately so. But this is an added risk factor with which\nthey have previously not had to deal. Also, during the next rising rate cycle, pent-up customer\ndemand for yield may force banks to re-price their deposits faster than has historically been the\ncase. Lastly, how retail investors in bond funds would respond to a rising rate cycle is uncertain,\nas are the knock-on effects of large selling pressure by these funds.\nThen there is the derivatives market, which the largest global banks continue to dominate\nand where they hold significant exposures. Notional values of derivatives held by FDIC-insured\ninstitutions exceeded $200 trillion at mid-year 2015. It is often pointed out that most U.S.\ninterest rate swaps and CDS index swaps are now cleared and information on these derivatives is\nreported to trade repositories. Notional volumes have come down as a result of trade\ncompression, and an enhanced margin rule recently finalized should further encourage clearing.\nStill, by some measures, derivatives exposure is a larger exposure category for banks today than\njust prior to the crisis. Net current credit exposure for derivatives at insured U.S. commercial\nbanks and savings associations is about twice the pre-crisis average, according to the OCC’s\nmost recent Quarterly Derivatives Report.\nFurther, while the increased use of clearing has changed the locus of these exposures, it\nhas not lessened risks to the system. The migration of standardized derivatives to clearing was a\npolicy decision intended to make the system safer, but without question it elevates the systemic\nimportance of safe and sound operations by central counterparties (CCPs). The potential for\nunanticipated events and risks, including resolution challenges, associated with the growing use\nof CCPs is a subject of concern to many observers and is being studied by international groups.\n\n4\n\n\fOne potential source of trouble, for example, involves CCPs lowering their margin\nrequirements, which is analogous to banks competing for loans by weakening their underwriting\nstandards. If underwriting or margins are lessened too much, exposures mount quickly and often\nunexpectedly. In this context the capital that a CCP holds typically is relatively small in relation\nto the volume of its derivatives business. The market tends to downplay this because clearing\nmembers’ guarantees place the risk of client nonperformance on their member banks rather than\nthe CCP. However, this simply punts the risk down the field. The risk still ultimately is against\nthe capital of the CCP’s member banks. Thus, the use of CCPs may not provide as much\ncomfort as we might have intended. The Basel leverage ratio, which has been adopted for the\nlargest firms in the U.S., requires banks to hold a small amount of capital against the potentially\nunlimited guarantee they provide to the CCP. Nevertheless, efforts continue to try to reduce or\neliminate the capital they hold against this guarantee. If this were to be allowed, large amounts\nof economic exposure to derivatives -- significant financial leverage and risk -- would vanish\nfrom the regulatory capital radar screen, encouraging even larger volumes of interlinked and\nopaque derivatives activity. Such an outcome strikes me as a counterintuitive abandonment of\npost-crisis regulatory initiatives.\nAnother troubling source of market volatility and uncertainty is “the great bear market in\ncommodity prices” that has persisted throughout much of the post-crisis period. The Bloomberg\ncommodity index, for example, which tracks the prices of major industrial raw materials, had –\nas of last week – declined 63 percent from its July 2008 peak to its lowest level since 2002.1\n\n1\n\nHeadline commodity index, http://www.bloombergindexes.com/resources/, accessed October 26, 2015.\n\n5\n\n\fImportant industry sectors such as energy and shipping have come under pressure, along\nwith individual firms with leveraged exposure to commodities. Complicating matters further are\nthe linkages in both directions between commodity prices and financial markets. For example,\nsome analysts have suggested that a tremendous expansion and subsequent contraction of\nstructured finance and swaps activity related to commodities was an important driver of the precrisis commodity price boom and its subsequent collapse.2 In the other direction, lost revenues\nfrom the sale of commodities by emerging market countries can drain their reserves and affect\ncurrency prices and the performance of a variety of financial contracts.\nFinally, we cannot ignore the reality that international financial linkages across countries\nare more important now than they were even just five years ago. For example, the deep concern\nexpressed by policymakers that Greece, a country with a GDP smaller than that of Louisiana,\nmight default or exit from the Eurozone suggests in part wariness about potentially unknowable\nfinancial linkages and knock-on effects in this interconnected world. The extent to which\nchanges in Chinese economic activity can reverberate on Wall Street further emphasizes the\nfragility of such linkages. And of course, U.S. developments with respect to our own federal\ndebt limit are closely tracked overseas because of their potential ripple effects.\nAt another level, international linkages are growing not only across legal boundaries but\nalso within our largest banking organizations. For example, the proportion of derivatives activity\nin the lead IDIs of the eight U.S. G-SIBs that is conducted from their foreign offices increased\nfrom 43 percent at yearend 2009 to 51 percent at yearend 2014. Exposures recorded as “net due\n\n2\n\nSee, e.g., http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2012/05/08/990211/the-subpriming-of-commodities/ and\nhttp://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/06/not-just-oil-are-lower-commodity-prices-here-to-stay.html, accessed October\n26, 2015\n\n6\n\n\ffrom” amounts that these IDIs have to their Edge corporation subsidiaries and other foreign\nsubsidiaries increased from less than $2 billion at yearend 2009 to almost $200 billion at yearend\n2014. I am not suggesting any specific safety and soundness concerns by mentioning these\nnumbers, but I am suggesting that the potential for transmission of unanticipated risks across\ninternational boundaries does not appear to be diminishing with time -- quite the opposite. These\nare not risks that I suggest banks should run from, but they are risks that banks must\nacknowledge and be prepared to absorb. Saying your risk models take care of it is not credible.\nSome of these sources of risk undoubtedly have been fed by current regulations designed\nto direct banks’ activities in accordance with regulators’ views. For example, banks levered up\non sovereign debt of nations such as Greece due to the zero risk-weighting given by “risk-based”\nrules. Trying to avoid crisis by directing activity and favoring certain investments to avoid crisis\nhas not proven successful so far, and I am doubtful it ever will. Rather, the banks that\nhistorically have best weathered crises are the ones with strong equity capital.\nTrust Built on Equity Capital\nWe hear often that trust and confidence in a system is necessary for it to successfully\ngrow and create wealth. In the last crisis, analysts didn’t trust banks’ risk models – they trusted\nequity capital. This capital is a necessary ingredient to building that trust. It will help ensure\nthat banks can survive liquidity runs because someone will continue to lend to institutions that\nare still demonstrably solvent, and it will make failure – or need for bailout -- less likely.\nPerhaps most importantly, strong capital will not require regulators to pick favored investments\nand put strict, complicated restrictions on an ever-growing set of activities.\n\n7\n\n\fThe next question, then, is how have we done at promoting this cushion of equity? I\nestimate that for the eight U.S. G-SIBs, a simple measure of tangible equity to tangible assets on\nthe balance sheet comes to about 7.7 percent for the group as of mid-year 2015. When the firms’\nbalance sheets and this ratio are adjusted, using estimates of International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRS), to measure derivatives exposure, the equity cushion for the group shrinks to\nabout 5.7 percent of exposure.3 That is barely two percentage points higher than what these\nlargest banks held as an industry when they entered the crisis, and it is unlikely to be adequate to\nmaintain market confidence should we encounter any major recession or significant deterioration\nin asset values.\nI have been told that a G-SIB needs less capital because it is more diversified than\nsmaller regional banks. But G-SIBs today are more exposed, not less, to the types of common\nmarket-based, interconnected, and opaque financial risks that move together and too often\nundermine stability. And of course, their operations now are more, not less, integral to financial\nmarkets that so decisively control the performance of the broader economy.\nCosts of Capital\nWhat about concerns for the costs of capital? The effect of higher capital on a bank’s\nforegone tax deductions, cost of funds, return on equity, industry ranking, and management\nbonuses are important for banks, of course, but these factors cannot be judged in isolation. A\nmore complete question from a system-wide perspective includes asking whether higher levels of\nbank capital affect sustainable levels of economy-wide consumption and output over time.\n\n3\n\nFor further information and data, see the Global Capital index:\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/capitalizationratio2015-2.pdf\n\n8\n\n\fIn this respect and for the ranges we are talking about, the system-wide benefits of strong\nequity capital would appear to far exceed the aggregate economic costs over the business cycle\nand thus should not be ignored. In the last crisis, for example, data show that better capitalized\nbanks failed less frequently and were able to maintain lending more effectively than their less\nwell capitalized counterparts.4 I would add further that, on a relative basis, current media\ncoverage suggest that better capitalized U.S. banks are currently outperforming their less well\ncapitalized European counterparts.\nConclusion\nLet me end by emphasizing that in the absence of government bailouts, a successful\nfinancial industry requires strong equity capital -- and then good assets and earnings supported\nby this capital. ROEs might be boosted in the short term using excessive leverage, but that is\nalmost never sustainable in the longer run. Thus, bankers and their regulators cannot afford to\nfall into the old habit of thinking when times are good that equity capital is merely a cost to the\nsystem.\nPolicymakers involved in capital regulation, including the Basel Committee as it\nproceeds with its review of the calibration of the leverage ratio, should take seriously the benefits\nof a strong foundation of equity capital, best measured using a leverage ratio. Contrary to some\nclaims, equity capital in fact supports sustainable risk taking over the course of the cycle by\nremoving the necessity of regulators to pick winners and losers, thus allowing the owners of the\n\n4\n\nCapital and lending ratios:\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/Lending%20through%20the%20cycle.pdf\nFailed bank capital ratios:\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/Failed%20Bank%20Capital%20Ratios%20at%20YE%202007_03%\n2026%202015.pdf\n\n9\n\n\fcapital to take their own risks, run their own firms, and absorb their own losses without public\nsupport.\n###\n\nThe views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of the FDIC.\nThomas M.

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOctober 6, 2015\nThe Faster Payments Imperative: Transforming the Market\nChicago, Illinois\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fGood morning. It is my pleasure to be here to offer my observations on what may\nbe one of the most ambitious undertakings in the history of our national payment\nsystem—the public-private engagement that is taking shape to improve the system’s\nspeed, efficiency and security. This engagement is designed to meet the growing\ndemands of American consumers and businesses that continue to shift toward ecommerce and Internet-enabled technologies in their daily transactions.\nTo some, it may seem like an unusual approach that we’ve taken, but it is not a\nnew one at its core. Based on a history of mutual cooperation on payments issues\nbetween the Federal Reserve and the private sector, we have seen public-private\nengagements yield important gains for the country. Such collaboration in the past\nproduced outcomes that contributed to a more resilient payments system and provided\nsignificant benefits to the public, such as the development of routing numbers, the growth\nof the automated clearing house network, and the crafting of Check 21 legislation.1\nI’m encouraged by the recent progress that we’ve made with the current effort,\nand it is my own conviction that the prospects for achieving the goals we’ve set out are\nbest realized by working together. The organizers of this conference used the right word\nin naming it. It is imperative that we modernize the payments system, and also that the\nFederal Reserve and the industry join together in this effort.\nIn my remarks this morning, I will preface my observations about the status of our\nwork by reflecting on the nature of the challenges we face and the strategies that have\nbeen framed to address them. These strategies, as you know, are the product of the\nFederal Reserve’s deliberate and broad consultation with a multitude of stakeholders\n\n1\n\nSee: Medley, Bill. Highways of Commerce: Central Banking and the U.S. Payments System. Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City. 2014.\n\n1\n\n\finvolved in payments system modernization. That input importantly shaped the paper\nissued in January of this year by the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks, titled\nStrategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System.\n\nThe challenge\nSince e-commerce took hold in the United States more than 20 years ago, it has\ngrown rapidly in volume, speed and capability and has transformed retail and businessto-business commerce. Among the most profound and pervasive changes has been the\nrising expectation of consumers and businesses for continuous improvements in speed\nand efficiency. People who have come to expect regular upgrades in computers and\ncommunications technology have also come to expect more functionality from their\ncomputers, tablets and smartphones to help them buy things. And so, same-day delivery\nof almost anything, for example, has become a way of life that most of us could not have\nimagined even a few years ago.\nIt was also some 20 years ago that online banking became commonly available,\nand here, too, there has been significant growth in speed, volume and the range of\nservices that banks provide. Simply put, Americans who demand fast and dependable\ndelivery of what they buy and sell want their payments to keep up. An analysis\ncommissioned by the Federal Reserve found that each year there are 29 billion payments\nfor which real-time or near-real-time delivery would be desirable to end users. One-third\nof consumers and fully three-fourths of businesses want real-time payments, and they are\nnow willing to pay for them.\n\n2\n\n\fThe growth of e-commerce and advances in communication have spurred\ninnovation and new business opportunities in the United States. Some of the most\nvaluable, innovative and admired businesses in the world are technology companies that\nwere founded here and remain here. But the sizable and widespread economic gains from\nthese advances require a payment system that meets the demands of consumers and\nbusinesses. We have seen a number of other countries move forward with faster and\nmore-efficient payment systems to better serve their citizens and compete with the United\nStates for new and expanding business. With this advanced capability, however, has\ncome a significant and evolving threat to the security of banking and commerce. The\nneed to stay ahead of this threat alone is a compelling reason to modernize the payment\nsystem.\n\nDesired outcomes\nThese challenges prompted the Federal Reserve to undertake careful study several\nyears ago and to seek extensive public input about the need to improve the U.S. payment\nsystem. By 2013, the Federal Reserve identified certain desired outcomes, based on its\nown analysis and private sector input.\nLet me describe those desired outcomes as a way to remind you of where we are\nheaded. First and foremost is the development of a safe and faster electronic solution for\nmaking a variety of business and personal payments that is both ubiquitous and available\non demand. Such a system would be supported by a flexible and cost-effective means for\npayment clearing and settlement that would be rapid and final.\n\n3\n\n\fOur second desired outcome is a payment system that remains safe and resilient.\nAny enhancements to speed and efficiency must maintain both the privacy and integrity\nof our system and allow for continuous improvements to security as threats emerge and\nevolve. Specifically, we anticipate potential improvements to the Federal Reserve’s\npublicly available payment fraud data as well as additional payment security research.\nWe also look forward to sharing our results with payment stakeholders because we\nbelieve they will help inform future industry actions and policy decisions.\nEfficiency is a third desired outcome. A reliable alternative to the 18 billion paper\nchecks written each year could reduce the average end-to-end cost of payment\ntransactions and allow innovative payment services to deliver better value to consumers\nand businesses alike.\nOur fourth desired outcome focuses on access and efficiency in cross-border\npayments. A new payment system should offer better choices for U.S. consumers and\nbusinesses to send and receive convenient, cost-effective and timely cross-border\npayments. We heard widespread support for this goal among stakeholders. Although\nthere is a range of views about the priority for such payments, few dispute that the cost\nand convenience of cross-border payments have not kept pace with the impact of\nglobalization.\nOur fifth desired outcome is simple: We need to work together. The Federal\nReserve cannot implement meaningful payments improvement on its own, and the\ncompetitive forces driving industry innovation mean the private sector’s ability to meet\nthe public’s needs would benefit from the kind of coordination and collaboration that the\nFederal Reserve is uniquely positioned to provide. Working together, we believe the\n\n4\n\n\fprivate sector can and should be able to provide the innovation necessary to address the\nneeds of the market.\n\nMaking progress toward these goals\nFollowing our review of public comments and lengthy consultation with\nstakeholders, the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks issued in January of this\nyear a paper that outlined strategies for improving the payment system.\nThese strategies represent the first steps in a roadmap for payments\nmodernization, and they define the approach for how the Federal Reserve will work with\nthe private sector. We expect and encourage private industry to advance these goals by\noffering its own ideas and plans. But we also expect to see cooperation and, at some\npoint, visible evidence of both commitment and progress from all stakeholders.\nSince the strategies paper was published early this year, active engagement has\ntaken shape with the creation of two task forces. One is focused on faster payments and\nthe other on the security of payments.\nOne way of describing the breadth of this effort is that many in this audience\nalready are members themselves or part of organizations represented on one or both task\nforces. At last count, the faster payments task force has more than 320 members and the\nsecure payments task force more than 170. There are representatives of technology\nproviders; small, medium and large financial institutions; payments networks; trade\nassociations; business end users and consumers; and a small number of government\nofficials. Each task force has chosen a steering committee, and work streams are\nunderway.\n\n5\n\n\fThe Faster Payments Task Force, with its large and diverse membership, began\nwork on criteria that will describe the standards for effectiveness in delivering faster\npayments. Members of the Secure Payments Task Force and a work group of legal\nsubject matter experts are providing specialized input to that work. When finalized, these\ncriteria will serve as both a description of stakeholder needs that the market can use to\nguide faster payments innovation and a tool for the task force itself to assess alternative\napproaches for faster payments solutions.\nThe task force also has developed and approved a decision-making framework.\nThis framework ensures that its decisions and work products have broad support of the\ntask force membership, including support within and across the different stakeholder\ngroups represented. Just yesterday, the Faster Payments Task force posted to the\nFedPaymentsImprovement.org website the latest draft of the criteria along with a survey\nto gather even broader public input. This effort to finalize the faster payments\neffectiveness criteria in the coming months remains on track.\nTo prepare for the evaluation of different approaches to payment modernization,\nthe Faster Payments Task Force is currently working to carefully define a process for\nencouraging the best ideas to come forward and assessing them against the effectiveness\ncriteria. In addition to identifying effective solutions for faster payments, the task force\nwill note the foundational aspects of a faster payment system that no single solution\nprovider can deliver independently, and when implemented, will enable those providers\nto interoperate and deliver to end users a consistent, accessible and universal faster\npayments experience. Finally, the task force will highlight strategic issues and gaps that it\n\n6\n\n\fbelieves must be addressed to pave the way for successful implementation and\nwidespread adoption of these solutions.\nTurning to the Secure Payments Task Force, its work has begun with a focus on\nthe security needed for faster payments solutions, including a high priority on identity\nmanagement and authentication and finding more effective ways to protect sensitive\ninformation that travels through the payment system. Importantly, however, the work of\nthe Secure Payments Task Force extends beyond the security needed for new faster\npayments. It is also focused on current payment networks and channels. As threats\nchange, they are considering better ways to share fraud and cyber-threat information and\nto analyze such data. Finally, the Secure Payments Task Force will advise the Federal\nReserve on priorities related to payments security standards, research and education in\norder to promote enhanced safety of payments systems old and new.\nAs the task forces continue their work, the Federal Reserve will do its part to\nensure that the process is progressing smoothly toward the desired outcomes I noted\nearlier. Task force membership will continue to be representative of diverse stakeholder\nperspectives and interests, and we will recruit when appropriate to fulfill that goal. We\nwant active task force participation that contributes to and takes ownership of work\nproducts and decisions. We will facilitate interaction and ensure processes and tools are\nin place to support the development of high-quality work products that achieve task force\nobjectives. In all of this, we want to promote a process that carefully considers the\ninterests of all stakeholders, objectively evaluates different proposals, and arrives at an\napproach that will have broad support. The hallmark of this process will be transparency\nand good communication, which are essential to reaching consensus.\n\n7\n\n\fLet me conclude by emphasizing that the progress achieved so far has been\nimpressive and encouraging. I remain confident that this collaborative approach to\npayment system reform maximizes our chances for success. I am also realistic. The task\nforces have made substantive progress, but there is some distance to go before realizing\nour goals. I fully expect that we will face challenges along the way. But I am convinced\nthe end is worth the journey, and the Federal Reserve is committed to working with\nindustry stakeholders to get there for the public’s sake.\n\n8\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJuly 9, 2015\nOklahoma Economic Forum\nStillwater, Oklahoma\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fSeven years ago, our economy was dealt a tremendous blow. The financial crisis and\ndeep recession required massive bailouts and aggressive, unconventional monetary policy\nactions to restore financial stability and economic growth. And yet, seven years later, uncertainty\nlingers about the durability and strength of financial reforms and of the economy itself. Clearly,\nthe financial crisis of 2008 cast a long shadow.\nIn my remarks today, I will offer my own observations about the current state of the\neconomy and why I believe the Federal Reserve should start the process of interest rate\nnormalization sooner rather than later. I’ll close with some perspectives on the state of key\nregulatory reforms affecting the banking industry and, in particular, the nation’s community\nbanks.\nThese are my own views and not those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the\nFederal Reserve System.\n\nThe economic outlook\nIn 2013, during my first voting rotation on the Federal Open Market Committee, I did not\nsupport additional stimulus in the form of a third round of asset purchases. By then, the\nimmediate crisis had passed, the economy was slowly expanding for its third consecutive year,\nand monetary policy settings remained extraordinarily accommodative. At the end of my voting\ncycle, I fully anticipated that a return to more-normal interest rates would require a lengthy and\ngradual adjustment process. But, I did not imagine that in 2015 we might still have the same\npolicy stance.\nDuring the past five years, the U.S. economy has grown at a moderate pace each year,\nlabor markets have healed—albeit with scars from the recession—and inflation has remained\n\n1\n\n\flow. This year, the economy had a slower-than-expected start. The soft GDP report for the first\nquarter reflected some temporary factors that held down growth but are unlikely to persist going\nforward. Looking ahead, I expect the economy to resume its expansion at an above-trend growth\nrate through the end of the year and labor market conditions to continue improving.\nConsumer spending, the largest part of our economy, will likely grow at a healthy rate in\nthe quarters ahead due to an improving labor market, rising wealth and lower gasoline prices\nrelative to where they were last year. Moreover, as the economy continues to heal and domestic\ndemand continues to strengthen, businesses should have more incentives to increase capital\nexpenditures. I also expect housing construction to provide a tailwind to growth as more adults\npack up and move out of their parents’ home or away from living with roommates to start their\nown households. Construction of multifamily units, in particular, has been strong due to rising\ndemand from younger workers and the decisions of some baby boomers to downsize.\nIn terms of the labor market, the economy added 3 million jobs over the past year. For\nperspective, consider that the economy did not even add this many new jobs over a one-year\nperiod at any point during the housing bubble years. You would need to go back to the late 1990s\ntech-bubble era to find a period when jobs were being added at a similar pace. In addition to the\nnumber of jobs, we are seeing better jobs. For example, workers today are flowing into morestable employment relationships, and workers with a high-school diploma or some college are\nfinding employment in higher-skilled occupations, something that was not occurring in the years\nfollowing the crisis.1\nTaken together, the economic data generally point to an economy that is moving in the\nright direction and has consistently sustained growth over the past five years. This is not to say\n1\n\nSee “Opportunity Knocks: Improved Matching of Jobs and Workers” by Didem Tuzemen and Jonathan Willis. The\nMacro Bulletin, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 13, 2015.\n\n2\n\n\fthe economy is issue-free. There are pockets of the labor market that continue to struggle.\nResearch shows that workers who enter the labor force during the lean years of a recession and\nrecovery experience long-lasting scarring effects on their earning potential.2 Millions of workers\nhad difficulty finding employment and missed some experience needed to jump-start their\ncareers, resulting in fewer skills, underdeveloped resumes and lower earnings. In addition,\nproductivity growth, which ultimately drives living standards higher, has been notably soft in\nrecent years. And, global economic concerns can pose unpredictable risks to our economy.\nUnfortunately, although we might wish it so, monetary policy is not the proper tool to\naddress all of these issues. The aggressive monetary actions over the past few years were\nintended to support economic activity, help labor markets heal and move inflation toward the\nFed’s target. I view the considerable progress in labor markets and the relatively steady inflation\nrate as encouraging. However, keeping interest rates near zero to achieve still further progress\ntoward labor market improvement and higher inflation is risky in my view.\nIn a protracted period of exceptionally low rates, investors seeking out higher returns are\nwilling to take on more risk or seek out more creative financing approaches. When the economy\nis expanding and rates remain low, adverse events may appear less likely or far into the future,\npotentially resulting in the mispricing of risk and financial assets. Waiting too long to adjust\nrates, as we’ve seen in the past, can leave policymakers with few and possibly poor options.\n\nSeparating the signal from the noise\nThe FOMC has been talking about its exit strategy since 2011. And since March of this\nyear, the Committee has been emphasizing that a decision to raise interest rates would be data\n2\n\nSee “Long-Term Nonemployment and Job Displacement” by Jae Song and Till von Wachter, presented at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s 2014 Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium.\n\n3\n\n\fdependent. In other words, economic data that confirms further gains in the economy’s\nperformance will drive the timing of the Committee’s actions.\nSo, why hasn’t the FOMC yet raised rates? There are of course different views on the\neconomic data we receive and analyze that lead to legitimate, differing views about what is best\nfor the economy. The Federal Reserve is charged with objectives that take into account\nemployment and inflation in order to foster stable long-term growth in the economy. The FOMC\nis committed to pursuing those objectives, but policymakers may differ on the appropriate path\nto achieve these long-run goals.\nOf course, the economic data we rely on can, and often does in the short run, send\nconflicting signals, and it is quite challenging to measure economic activity in an $18 trillion,\ndynamic economy. As a result, policymakers are faced with an unclear path for moving interest\nrates. Those choices are all the more difficult as we must rely on backward-looking data to frame\na forecast that takes into account the long lags of interest rate changes.\nUnder such circumstances, the Federal Reserve must be especially careful to avoid\nreacting to the last data point to determine policy. Instead, it should focus on longer-run trends as\nit seeks to understand the economy’s future course and to map the best policy to assure it\nremains on course. The real challenge when the data disappoints is discerning whether it is due\nto temporary factors or an early signal that underlying momentum in the economy is changing.\nTake the first quarter of this year as an example. The current estimate is that the economy\ncontracted in the first quarter after three quarters of relatively strong growth. While this headline\nnumber raises caution for policymakers, other factors, as I mentioned earlier, suggest the slowing\nis likely to be temporary. Severe winter weather and labor negotiations concerning dock workers\nlikely took a short-lived toll on growth. At the same time, however, the economy added nearly\n\n4\n\n\f600,000 new jobs in the first three months of this year. So even though the economy appeared to\nslow a bit in the first quarter, businesses kept hiring, and the data for the second quarter suggest\nthe economy is again expanding. Thus, in the face of consistent positive trends, delaying actions\nfor more positive data can be unwise.\nConsider as another example measures of inflation, which have been running below the\nFed’s stated inflation goal. Since 2012, the Federal Reserve has defined 2 percent inflation as\n“most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate” of price\nstability. Does inflation below 2 percent justify waiting longer to raise rates? The answer\nrequires a deeper look at the data. Much of the decline in inflation comes from a dramatic fall in\nenergy prices throughout the second half of 2014 and low import prices from a strong dollar. The\nswings in energy and food prices certainly matter for households and are an important\ncomponent of the inflation measure, but sometimes it’s also sensible to look at price changes that\nexclude these volatile goods. Along these lines, the core measure of inflation is running at 1.2\npercent over the past year and has moved up to a 1.7 percent pace over the past three months.\nThis data suggest to me that we understand why inflation has been low, and as some temporary\nfactors fade, it will likely move back toward the Fed’s goal.\nPart of our job is to look through the noise and act in the economy’s long-run best\ninterest. Separating the signal from the noise is always difficult and is usually clear only with\nhindsight. Because monetary policy decisions are made in real time, waiting for more data before\ntaking an action can be a trap. More data is always on its way, and waiting for clarity too often\ncauses decisions to be persistently postponed.\n\n5\n\n\fTiming is everything\nThe continued improvement in the labor market, combined with low and stable inflation,\nconvince me that modestly higher short-term interest rates are appropriate. Current guideposts, or\n“policy rules,” often used to inform monetary policy decisions also have been signaling that\ninterest rates should be higher.\nI recognize that a rate increase, however, would be the first one in nearly a decade. So I\nam not suggesting rates should be normalized quickly or that policy should be tight. Although\nthe economy has improved, economic fundamentals could well mean an accommodative stance\nof policy is appropriate for some time. I would like to avoid the cost of waiting for more\nevidence and further postponing liftoff, drawing on a valuable lesson from monetary policy\ndecisions in 2003.\nAt that time, the federal funds rate was held at a very low level—1 percent—because\npolicymakers were concerned about low inflation and had postponed initiating the tightening\ncycle in response. Inflation excluding food and energy in late 2003 was running at about 1.3\npercent, not dissimilar from today. The unemployment rate was slightly below 6 percent, again,\nnot dissimilar from today.\nBy the middle of 2004, core inflation increased to 2 percent as the unemployment rate\ncontinued to decline. A gradual tightening cycle began in June of 2004. Core inflation then\nmoved persistently above 2 percent, and the labor market began to overheat amid one of the most\nhistoric credit bubbles in U.S. history.\nOf course, many would argue that we do not face a similar buildup of leverage today and\nthat the recovery remains fragile. Perhaps so, and perhaps this time it's different. However,\n\n6\n\n\feconomic trends and experience suggest otherwise. And we would be wise to act modestly but\nact now.\n\nProgress on regulatory reforms\nIn addition to the lessons for monetary policy, the recent crisis taught us of the expanding\nchallenges following from an increasingly concentrated and fragile financial system. While the\nlargest financial institutions are meant to be engines of growth, they also pose outsized risk to the\neconomy. With that in mind, I take note that this month marks the fifth anniversary of the\nsigning of the Dodd-Frank Act, the law that aimed to remedy problems associated with the 2008\nfinancial crisis and, in particular, sought to end the status of “too big to fail.” While regulators\nhave worked diligently over the past five years to implement new rules, debate about the law’s\nvarious provisions continues.\nImplementing rules focused on limiting certain risky activities has proved difficult. For\nexample, the law prohibits banks from conducting proprietary trading and from investing in\nhedge and private equity funds. Regulators have struggled with complexity in writing this rule,\nand banks have lobbied heavily against it. The final rule was not approved until late 2013 and did\nnot go into effect until April of last year. The deadline for fully complying with the rule could\nextend into 2017.\nAnother provision aimed at limiting risky activities has already been repealed. The socalled push-out rule was designed to move trading of credit default, commodity and equity swaps\nout of federally-insured depositories to non-insured operating affiliates. Congress reversed this\npart of the law last December, allowing the nation’s largest banks to continue their swaps trading\nwith the benefit of public safety nets.\n\n7\n\n\fAlso core to the objectives of the Dodd-Frank reforms was preventing future government\nrescues of big banks. Last week, another round of resolution plans, referred to as living wills,\nwas submitted to the regulators. It remains open, if not doubtful, whether a credible resolution\nprocess can be codified so as to eliminate—or even minimize—the pressure to rescue a large\ninsolvent bank with taxpayer money.\nOf course many point to the progress made in strengthening capital levels of the largest\nbanks. Today, the 10 largest banks hold $8 of tangible equity for every $100 of assets, far more\nthan the $3 held in 2008. However, if the full value of derivatives is included in assets, as\nrequired under international standards, the ratio of capital-to-assets is only 5 ½ percent.\nCompared to more than 10 percent held by the nation’s community banks, further progress is\nneeded.\nFinally, a large segment of the banking industry composed of thousands of community\nbanks faces a regulatory overlay intended for those engaged in global markets and riskier\nactivities. Multiple bills to provide relief from certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have\nbeen proposed. Most practical and promising is a proposal by FDIC Vice Chairman Tom Hoenig\nthat focuses on calibrating regulation according to a bank’s activities and complexity rather than\nsize. I hope it is receiving serious consideration in the interest of a stronger and more-stable\nfinancial system.\n\nConclusion\nThe U.S. economy and its financial system have made notable progress over the past five\nyears. Regulatory reforms and monetary policy have been necessary ingredients in achieving this\nprogress. But it is time to recalibrate these measures.\n\n8\n\n\fOur regulatory efforts must remain centered on ending too big to fail without\nundermining the health and diversity of the financial system. Likewise, monetary policy must\nstep back and allow market forces to resume their critical role of pricing risk and allocating\ncapital to its best use. Although an accommodative stance of policy may be needed for some\ntime during this transition, monetary policy cannot solve every economic challenge we face.\nStarting now to move rates up slowly and deliberately will allow the economy to adjust to a\nmore-normal and, in my view, appropriate stance of monetary policy that will lead to long-term\ngrowth.\n\n9\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nConcluding Remarks\n“The Puzzle of Payments Security”\nInternational Payments Policy Conference\nKansas City, Mo.\nJune 26, 2015\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fI want to thank the program presenters and discussants for the insights they’ve brought to\nthis most important and timely issue of retail payments security. The conference has highlighted\nencouraging areas of progress, including technology, information sharing and collaborative\nefforts among financial institutions, networks, consumers and regulators. It also has served as a\nreminder that sizeable challenges remain.\nThe Federal Reserve has a keen interest in promoting the safety and the security of the\nnation’s payments system, given its impact on the broader economy and public trust. As both an\noperator and an overseer within the payments system, the Federal Reserve is prepared to\nleverage its central bank roles to bring about critical improvements for payments security.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve is relatively unique among central banks in terms of its\nretail payments operator role, public authorities around the world have become more active in\nraising concerns about retail payments security. Some authorities play explicit roles with public\nmandates, while others rely on leadership to induce voluntary changes in the industry. In the\nUnited States, the central bank has chosen to serve as a leader for a collaborative approach,\ninvolving a wide range of payments participants as the path toward improving the system.\nThis is not a new role for the Federal Reserve. Since its founding, the public has looked\nto the Federal Reserve to provide leadership on advancing the safety, efficiency and accessibility\nof the nation’s payment system. Congress initially designed the Fed to serve as a payments\nsystem operator through the regional Reserve Banks and as an overseer of the system through its\nsupervision of financial institutions. These roles give the Fed relevant insights as we work with\nothers to address the security challenges we face today.\nFor its own part as an operator, the Fed must consider and ensure the security of its own\nclearing and settlement activities, and this directly influences a large segment of U.S. retail\n1\n\n\fpayments. The Fed’s financial services business also provides resources to support development\nof payment standards, including those related to security. And, there are plans underway to work\nwith the Fed’s financial services customers to identify demand for enhanced risk-management\nproducts that complement the Federal Reserve’s suite of wire, automated clearinghouse and\ncheck service offerings.\nAs a payments system overseer, the Federal Reserve and other agencies ensure banks\nprotect their systems from unauthorized access to online banking systems and safeguard sensitive\npersonal or account information. In the case of retail payment fraud, consumers have been\nprotected from significant losses by regulations.\nThese roles have informed the central bank and enhanced its credibility where it plays a\nless formal but equally important role—that of leader and catalyst for change. The improvements\nwe seek for greater security in the U.S. payments system do not stem from a specific mandate\nfrom Congress, but rather from an interest in ensuring stability and confidence in the payments\nsystem.\nIn this role, the Federal Reserve seeks to drive improvement in the payments system\nthrough a collaborative approach, which in the past has led to payments innovations that we take\nfor granted today. Routing numbers on paper checks, the development of the ACH, and the\nimplementation of Check 21 are all examples of diverse interests coming together to find a\nsolution to common challenges.\nIt is in this spirit that we recently established two task forces to take on today’s\nchallenges. These groups are comprised of diverse and committed membership, which will\nensure a broad range of perspectives are considered as we move forward.\n\n2\n\n\fOne task force will focus on identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a\nsafe, ubiquitous and faster payments capability in the United States. The other task force will\nprovide input on security aspects of a faster payments capability, and serve as a forum to advise\nthe Federal Reserve on how to address security matters and to identify and promote actions that\ncan be taken by payment system participants collectively or by the Federal Reserve System.\nAn important question is: How will we judge success of these efforts? Each task force\nwill be asked to identify the criteria by which they will measure success. In the near-term, we\nwill look to the secure payments task force to articulate key priorities. We will also be looking\nfor evidence of commitment from payments system participants to take action on these priorities.\nLonger-term, we hope to see this collaboration among industry participants continue,\nresulting in progress on the development and adoption of effective security standards. We would\nalso hope to see robust research and implementation of processes that result in better data and the\nability to closely monitor fraud and identify adverse trends, develop more effective responses,\nand track policy initiatives. Success will mean payments modernization in the United States is\nwell on its way, with adoption that reflects the public’s strong confidence in new capabilities.\nTime will tell whether this collaborative approach can be successful or whether the Fed\nneeds to take a different approach to foster a modern payments system that serves the needs of a\ndynamic economy.\nIt was ten years ago, in 2005, that the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City hosted its\nfirst payments conference titled, “Interchange Fees in Credit and Debit Card Markets.” During\nthe two days of presentations, discussion and debate among leading economists, industry leaders\nand policymakers, the need for intervention in the credit and debit markets was hotly contested.\nBy 2010, Congress intervened with regulation.\n\n3\n\n\fAs we conclude this conference on payments security, I sense a greater degree of\nconsensus around the security challenges we face. As the Federal Reserve begins the work of\nconvening and engaging with stakeholders to achieve a faster, more secure and widely available\npayments system, the pieces of the puzzle lie before us. Putting them together in a way that\nmaintains the public’s confidence is both our challenge and our opportunity.\n\n4\n\n\f"

            "content": "The Next Phase of Monetary Policy\n\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nCentral Exchange\nKansas City, Mo.\nMarch 4, 2015\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fGood afternoon. I appreciate the opportunity to be here at the Central Exchange. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with this\norganization, and I applaud the Central Exchange’s important contributions to supporting women\nin our community as it celebrates its 35th anniversary this year.\nAs the national economy continues to expand, the Federal Reserve has turned its attention\nto the issues associated with normalizing monetary policy after years of unprecedented\naccommodation. Preparing for the next phase of monetary policy has involved consideration of\nthe mechanics for raising rates, clear principles supporting the normalization process, and now,\nthe discussion about the appropriate timing of the first rate increase. In my remarks today, I’ll\noffer my views on the economy’s progress and the appropriate stance of monetary policy. I will\nclose by offering some observations about recent calls for further transparency and\naccountability for the Federal Reserve.\nThese are my own views and not those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the\nFederal Reserve System.\n\nThe economic outlook\nThe U.S. economy is expanding at an above-trend growth rate, which I expect to continue\nthrough the end of the year. A strong dollar and certain aspects of the foreign outlook pose some\nrisks, but the economy appears well positioned to withstand such headwinds.\nThe economic outlook is positive for both consumers and businesses. Consumer\nconfidence strengthened markedly in the second half of last year as gasoline prices declined and\nthe labor market improved, and we have seen an increased willingness to spend on discretionary\ngoods and services, such as restaurants and recreational activities. Household balance sheets\n\n1\n\n\fcontinue to strengthen, which should support consumer spending. Meanwhile, businesses\nare reporting that it’s a good time to expand, with industrial capacity utilization hitting its\npre-recession rate and spending on research and development accelerating.\nImportantly, this improved outlook for consumers and businesses suggests that\nmomentum in the labor market will likely continue going forward. The economy added\nmore than 3 million jobs in 2014, the highest level since 1999, and the rapid pace of job\ncreation has continued into the beginning of 2015.\nAlong with this strong employment growth, we’ve seen significant improvement\nin the unemployment rate, which has fallen from 6.7 percent in December 2013 to 5.7\npercent in January of this year. The current level is less than one-half percentage point\naway from what many view as the long-run normal rate. With more than 5 million job\nopenings currently posted, there are now fewer than two unemployed people per job\nopening, down from nearly seven per job opening during the depths of the financial\ncrisis. Evidence from the last business cycle indicates that as this balance tilts toward a\ntighter labor market, wage pressures are likely to increase.\nAlready, the rates at which people voluntary leave their jobs are increasing as\nemployers look to recruit workers from other firms and workers look to increase their\nwages. For example, research by my staff shows that in the second half of 2014,\nindividuals who switched jobs saw their wages increase more than 5 percent compared to\nwhat they earned in the prior quarter—a notable rise compared to a few years earlier. As\nmore workers quit their jobs and seek out higher-paying employment, wage pressures are\nlikely to broaden and further increase.\n\n2\n\n\fOf course, while these positive indicators are encouraging, the labor market is not\ncompletely back to normal. For example, the share of “long-term” unemployed and the number\nnumber of individuals working part-time for economic reasons remains elevated. These aspects\nof our labor market are concerning. As the economy continues to expand and the labor market\ntightens further, job opportunities should become more available for those who have had\ndifficulty securing full-time employment.\nTo evaluate the health of the labor market in a way that takes into account both strong\nemployment growth and job-finding challenges for many others, my staff developed an index of\nlabor market conditions that includes a range of variables—something like a stock market index\nfor the labor market. This approach shows that momentum in the labor market is near its highest\nrate in two decades. If momentum continues at this pace, the labor market will return to its\naverage level of activity later this year. This does not mean that all labor markets indicators will\nbe back to pre-crisis levels or even their historical average, but on a broad basis, the labor market\nwill be close to what can be considered normal.\nTypically, a growing economy and tightening labor market would be accompanied by\nrising inflation. That has not been the case recently. In terms of consumer price inflation, the\nFed’s preferred measure is running at 0.25 percent year-over-year—down from the 1.5 percent\npace at the middle of last year. The recent sharp declines in oil prices are positive for economic\ngrowth, but lower energy prices are dampening headline measures of inflation. However, the\nimpact of these transitory factors should fade later this year, particularly as oil prices stabilize.\nLooking beyond these temporary factors, other important components of inflation are\nmoving higher. Rental prices for housing have been strong, for example, and are likely to\ncontinue rising. The strength in the labor market I just mentioned is also likely to lead to more\n\n3\n\n\frapid wage gains. So while inflation is somewhat below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, I am\nnot overly concerned with this shortfall. Instead, I see current and forecasted inflation as\ngenerally consistent with price stability.\nAgainst a backdrop of the ongoing economic expansion, a strengthening labor\nmarket and low but firming inflation, it is reasonable to contemplate a shift in the stance\nof monetary policy. Moving to the next phase of policy entails judgment on both the\ntiming of the first rate increase and then the pace of future increases—issues that the\nFederal Open Market Committee will deliberate carefully.\n\nThe liftoff decision\nThe labor market, as I’ve highlighted, has experienced substantial improvement\nover the past year. But in earlier stages of the recovery, much of the emphasis was on a\nweak labor market as the driver of accommodative policy. For example, we implemented\na number of bond-buying programs, commonly referred to as “QE 1, 2, and 3,” held the\nfederal funds rate near zero since the end of 2008, and relied on various iterations of\n“forward guidance” to signal our intentions that short-term rates would remain\naccommodative. Until March of last year, forward guidance for keeping short-term rates\nnear zero hinged on a 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold. In addition, the last\nlarge-scale asset purchase program was tied to achieving substantial improvement in the\noutlook for the labor market. This past October, we took the first steps towards\nnormalization by ending the bond-buying programs.\nNow with the economy approaching full employment, attention has turned to\nmoving inflation back towards the 2 percent goal. Rather than focusing solely on either\n\n4\n\n\femployment or inflation, policy needs to take a balanced approach, as is clearly codified in the\nFed’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. The balanced approach\nsuggests that temporary deviations of unemployment and inflation from their longer-run values\ndo not necessarily warrant an extreme policy setting. Instead, the stance of policy needs to take\ninto account the magnitudes of any deviations, as well as how long any deviation is expected to\nlast. Currently, unemployment is not far from its longer-run level, and the lower rate of headline\ninflation is expected to be temporary. And as I’ve mentioned, monetary policy should look\nthrough temporary factors, such as the oil price decline, as long as there is reasonable confidence\nthat inflation will be moving towards 2 percent within the forecast horizon and that longer-term\ninflation expectations remain stable.\nThis balanced approach framework supports taking steps to remove the extraordinary\namount of monetary accommodation currently in place. The next phase in this process is to move\nthe federal funds rate off its near-zero setting. While the FOMC has made no decisions about the\ntiming of this action, I continue to support liftoff towards the middle of this year due to\nimprovement in the labor market, expectations of firmer inflation, and the balance of risks over\nthe medium and longer run.\nLiftoff in the middle of this year, in my view, would be fully consistent with the FOMC’s\nStatement on Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which reminds the public that “monetary\npolicy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag.” This means some time\nwill pass before we can see the effects of interest rate decisions, so monetary policy must be\nforward-looking and act before the economy reaches full employment and 2 percent inflation.\nWaiting until economic conditions are nearly back to normal before raising rates may put policy\nbehind the curve and require rates to rise rapidly in the future.\n\n5\n\n\fAnother factor supporting liftoff in the near future is that many of the benchmarks\npolicymakers use to assess the appropriate level of short-term rates indicate rates should\nbe above zero. These benchmarks signal liftoff even after accounting for some possible\nchanges in the economy, such as a slower trend rate of growth stemming from\ndemographic change and a more modest pace of productivity growth.\n\nAfter liftoff\nAlthough considerable attention is now centered on the timing of raising rates,\nthis step is only one of many in the policy normalization process. Every interest rate\ndecision depends on how the economy unfolds, so simply deciding to make the first\ninterest rate move by no means puts interest rate decisions on autopilot. At the same time,\npolicymakers can’t perpetually wait for just “one more data point,” so actions often must\nbe taken in anticipation of how economic conditions are expected to develop.\nThe FOMC will need to be forward-looking in determining the pace of removing\naccommodation. Unique to the extraordinary amount of monetary stimulus that exists\ntoday, it is important to emphasize these steps are a “removal of accommodation” and not\n“tightening.” I see raising the federal funds rate off zero in the middle of this year as a\nstep to normalize financial conditions alongside a strengthening economy, rather than an\nattempt to slow an overheating economy. The alternative of moving rates off zero much\nlater, but raising them at a faster pace, risks disrupting financial market and sharply\nslowing economic activity. For that reason, I see more balanced risks under an approach\nthat raises rates sooner, such as in the middle of this year, but at a gradual pace.\n\n6\n\n\fConclusion\nAs the Federal Reserve contemplates its path to normalizing monetary policy, it does so\nat a time of tremendous public scrutiny. There are calls for more transparency and accountability\nrelated to its monetary policy and its supervision and regulation of large financial institutions.\nAs a result, changes to Fed structure and governance are being contemplated by Congress.\nTo be sure, accountability and the public’s scrutiny of the Federal Reserve are to be\nexpected and appropriate. It is well understood that securing the public’s trust and confidence\ndepends on the central bank’s ability to meet its mandates from Congress. But contemplated\nchanges should be focused in a way that does not compromise the Federal Reserve’s key\nstrengths, including an independent FOMC and a decentralized structure. Broad-based\nrepresentation, public oversight and the ability of policymakers to bring independent views to the\ntable have been enduring features of the system and have proven to be a source of strength for\nthe nation’s central bank. It would be a mistake to alter that balance without thoughtful and\ncareful consideration.\n\n7\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFinancial Stability Institute/Bank for International Settlements\nAsia-Pacific High-Level Meeting\nManila, Philippines\nFebruary 10, 2015\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fToday’s program focuses on various aspects of reforms since the global financial crisis\nthat aim to address the risks posed to financial and economic stability. Central banks have long\nrecognized that financial stability considerations play a key role in achieving monetary policy\nobjectives. Yet, there remains considerable debate about the role that monetary policy itself\ncontributes to financial stability and what steps a central bank should take with its policy regime.\nIn my remarks today, I will review considerations on the interaction between financial\nstability and monetary policy, as well as the post-crisis enthusiasm for the use of\nmacroprudential regulatory approaches in addition to supervision of individual banking firms. I\nwill conclude with my own views on the role of monetary policy in assuring economic objectives\nare achieved in the context of financial stability.\n\nThe relationship between monetary policy and financial stability\nPrior to the recent global financial crisis, a common view held that monetary policy\nshould not lean against apparent financial market imbalances—except to the extent they affected\nthe outlook for growth and inflation—but, instead, clean up after a bubble bursts. This line of\nthinking rested on three assumptions.\nThe first is that spotting asset price bubbles or financial imbalances in real-time is\nnotoriously difficult—something that is just as true today as in the past. Knowing at what point\nand how aggressively to intervene using monetary policy also poses a number of practical\nchallenges. A second assumption is that monetary policy can be effective at limiting the damage\nto the broader economy after the bursting of an asset-price bubble. The pre-crisis consensus\nviewed a collapse of asset prices as having the potential to inflict sustained damage to the\nbroader economy, but also held that monetary policy could mitigate the fallout. A third\n\n1\n\n\fassumption supporting the pre-crisis consensus is what I will call “the separation principle,” in\nwhich regulators concern themselves with oversight of the financial sector while monetary\npolicymakers focus on macroeconomic objectives, such as inflation and, in some cases,\nemployment. The goal of price stability was seen as largely complementary with that of financial\nstability, given a well-designed regulatory structure that monitored the risk exposures of the\nfinancial sector.\nGiven these assumptions, broader discussions on the role of central banks in fostering\nfinancial stability were rare. The bursting of the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, followed by the\nrelatively mild recession in 2001 only reinforced these views. After many years of financial\nmarket stability in advanced economies, policymakers seemed to have reason to view monetary\npolicy as appropriately focused on macroeconomic objectives—that is, until the onset of the\nglobal financial crisis that began in 2007.\nThe collapse of the housing market in the United States and the global economic events\nthat followed have posed fundamental challenges to the thinking about the role of monetary\npolicy in maintaining financial stability. And without doubt, financial instability inflicted\ndamage that pulled many central banks far from their objectives for a prolonged period.\n\nA macroprudential approach\nToday, central banks are digesting a growing body of research on the appropriate roles of\nmonetary and regulatory policy in fostering financial stability. The influence of this research on\nactual monetary policy decisions has been only modest, although financial stability concerns are\nbecoming more frequently discussed in the context of monetary policy. For example, the Federal\nReserve has adopted a Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which\n\n2\n\n\fconveys to the public the objectives of monetary policy. The statement says that “risks to the\nfinancial system” that threaten to impede attainment of the Committee’s longer-run goals may\nwarrant a monetary policy response. No adjustment to policy has yet been made due to risks\nfrom the financial sector.\nHowever, some countries over the past few years have raised financial stability concerns\nto a level sufficient to warrant a policy response. In most cases, monetary policy was not altered.\nInstead, macroprudential tools were deployed to address overheating property markets or rising\nhousehold indebtedness. Monetary policy has largely remained focused on inflation and\nemployment, leaving financial stability to regulators and their macroprudential approaches; in\nother words, the separation principle remains largely intact.\nIn fact, the deployment of macroprudential tools may be perceived as further removing\nthe need for monetary policy to be concerned with financial stability. For example,\ncountercyclical capital policy can be used to reduce the banking sector’s leverage and expand its\nloss-absorbing capacity during an expansion. Calibrating the appropriate timing and degree for\nusing this tool, however, poses some practical challenges that are similar to those associated with\nmonetary policy. The Federal Reserve plans to use a framework incorporating countercyclical\ncapital adjustments, though details, such as when and by how much to release the buffer, will\nneed to be more fully developed.\nIn addition to countercyclical capital, policymakers and regulators have embraced\nmacroprudential approaches to liquidity requirements. These steps are designed to guard against\nexcessive maturity transformation, which in the past has led to asset fire sales and large swings\nin asset valuations. With the new rules, banks must hold a minimum amount of highly liquid\n\n3\n\n\fassets under stressed conditions to ensure adequate funding and prevent fire sale losses and\nrelated externalities.\nTo evaluate whether the capital and liquidity positions of individual institutions aggregate\nto a stable banking system, stress-testing has been used. In the United States, stress-testing has\nlong been a microprudential tool aimed at ensuring the safety and soundness of individual\ninstitutions and understanding, for example, a bank’s interest rate risk exposure. Since the crisis,\nit has also become an important macroprudential tool that provides a horizontal view of\nsystemically important firms and their vulnerabilities to a wide variety of shocks to economic\nand financial conditions. While stress-testing has proven to be a valuable tool, the results can be\nquite sensitive to a number of factors, such as model specifications and estimation periods. For\nthese reasons, regulators should be cautious about taking too much reassurance from the tests.\nRegulators also must remain focused on traditional microprudential, or firm-specific,\nsupervision and regulation. Sound execution of macroprudential regulation depends on sound\nmicroprudential regulation. Ensuring that individual banking organizations are operating in a\nsafe and sound manner is a prerequisite to their ability to withstand the economic and financial\nshocks that can lead to financial instability. In the United States, perhaps the most notable\nexamples were the declines in residential and commercial mortgage underwriting standards that\nemerged in the years leading up to the crisis. For commercial real estate, in particular, growing\nconcentrations led the banking agencies to issue supervisory guidance in 2006. However,\nhighlighting such issues is of little value unless it is timely and accompanied by targeted actions\nto limit the risk exposure. From this standpoint, I see extremely strong complements between\nmicro- and macroprudential regulation.\n\n4\n\n\fFinancial stability and monetary policy interactions\nJust as micro- and macroprudential policies play central roles in safeguarding financial\nstability, so does monetary policy. I often hear the view that macroprudential policy should be\nthe “first line of defense” for maintaining financial stability. Unfortunately, this approach expects\ntoo much of tools for which our understanding is imperfect. In addition, a growing body of\nresearch shows monetary policy plays a key role in affecting risk appetite and risk premiums.\nAsking regulators to ensure risk-taking is not endangering financial stability places a large\nburden on our regulatory infrastructure, especially in an environment of highly accommodative\nmonetary policy.\nIndeed, central banks have used zero interest rates and large-scale asset purchases or\nquantitative easing as a type of monetary easing that would affect risk-taking, asset valuations\nand economic growth. While accommodative monetary policy can affect economic activity via\nthis channel, it can also create financial market vulnerabilities, especially if sustained for a\nprolonged period. If financial imbalances in one sector turn out to have systemic consequences,\nthen a reliance on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy to stimulate economic activity\ncould prove more detrimental than beneficial over the longer run for achieving stable inflation\nand employment.\nIn particular, a monetary policy that fails to take into account building systemic or tail\nrisks exposes the economy to potential large setbacks in the future. Investors fluctuate between\nbeing more or less concerned about these unlikely—but severe—economic outcomes. These\nconcerns are often incorporated in risk premiums, which reflect investor concerns about the\ndegree and likelihood of severe events. For example, a rise in risk premiums can indicate a\nrecession may be on the horizon, even when macroeconomic data may be providing no such\n\n5\n\n\fsignal. Alternatively, unusually low risk premiums, such as were experienced in 2003-2005,\nreflected investors who were underestimating the severity and likelihood of a downturn in the\nhousing market.\nResearch points to the effect monetary policy has on several aspects of risk-taking. For\nexample, after taking into account economic conditions, low policy rates are correlated with\noverall easier financial conditions, as we see banks increase the share of risky assets they hold,\ncredit quality decline, risk premiums on syndicated loans fall, lending standards soften, and\nfinancial institutions move towards shorter-term funding and higher leverage.1 Many of these\nfactors manifest themselves in elevated asset valuations and rising credit growth. Once asset\nvalues or credit growth has risen to a level warranting concern, it is likely too late for monetary\npolicy to smoothly unwind these imbalances without triggering a sharp reversal that ultimately\ninflicts damage on the real economy.\nA focus on risk-taking and risk premiums in the context of monetary policy leads to two\nquestions. The first is whether risk premiums are useful for predicting economic activity.\nResearch from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City suggests they are, but they offer more\nof a signal about the future when they are rising than when they are falling.2 That is, rising risk\npremiums signal poor economic performance in the future, while declining risk premiums are not\nnecessarily a good indicator of strong economic performance. Low risk premiums, however, may\nsow the seeds for future financial instability. The second question is whether monetary policy\ncan affect risk premiums. This same line of research also suggests monetary policy does alter\nrisk premiums. As policy eases, risk premiums have a tendency to decline, suggesting that\n1\n\nSee, for example, Rajan (2005); Jimenez et al (2012); Santos (2012); Maddaloni and Peydo (2011); Stein (2012,\n2013); Adrian and Shin (2010); Adrian, Moench and Shin (2009). Adrian and Laing (2014) provide a\ncomprehensive overview.\n2\nSee Cao, Doh and Molling, “Should Monetary Policy Look at Risk Premiums in Financial Markets?” forthcoming\nin the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Economic Review.\n\n6\n\n\fattempts to lower already low risk premiums will likely do little in terms of future economic\nactivity but may foster conditions that pose risks to financial stability.\nThis line of thinking suggests to me that modestly tighter policy earlier in the business\ncycle expansion could moderate risk-taking and the potential for destabilizing financial\nimbalances to build. In reviewing financial stability reports for several countries prior to the\nglobal financial crisis, my staff found some countries effectively identified a number of risks that\nplayed important roles in the crisis but underestimated their severity.3 Identifying “excess” risktaking always carries challenges, particularly in finding the right benchmark with which to assess\nrisk-taking. Still, a number of these reports highlighted risks, but late in the business cycle when\nthere was little monetary policy could do except wait to clean up. In addition, using monetary\npolicy to prick bubbles after they have developed, to slow elevated levels of credit growth, or to\nencourage firms to scale back on high levels of leverage are likely to end poorly.\nThe bottom line is that it is difficult to address stability concerns in particular sectors\nafter they have developed. Instead, it may be appropriate to adjust policy to address suppressed\nrisk premiums early in the expansion rather than late. Once valuation pressures emerge, or\nunderwriting standards have been stretched, then it is often too late. As a result, interest rate\npolicy used earlier in the cycle can foster a more stable financial landscape as a business cycle\nmatures.\n\nRevisiting the pre-crisis consensus\n\n3\n\nChristensson, Spong, and Wilkenson, “Financial Stability Reports: How Useful During a Financial Crisis?”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Economic Review, 2010.\n\n7\n\n\fThe lessons of the financial crisis are many and warrant careful assessment of\nassumptions that have guided the thinking about the proper relationship between monetary policy\nand financial stability. It remains true that we can’t identify bubbles in real time, or at least don’t\nknow the proper time and manner to intervene to stem their rise. Following the collapse of a\nbubble, monetary policy can be judiciously used to limit the damage inflicted on the real\neconomy. However, monetary policy runs the risk of remaining overly accommodative following\na downturn, and lead to future instability. Importantly, policymakers should reassess the\nassumption that monetary policy and macroprudential regimes can be used independently. This\n“separation principle” remains widely accepted and continues to argue that macroprudential tools\noffer the “first line of defense” against risks to financial stability.\nOur recent experience, combined with empirical evidence, suggests this view should be\nchallenged. A comprehensive approach that views monetary and macroprudential policy as a\ncomplements, reinforced by sound microprudential underpinnings, is the best approach to\nachieve a stable financial system and the long-run objectives of central banks for sustainable\neconomic growth.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "Community Bank Regulation: Intent vs. Reality\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century\nConference hosted by the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nSept. 23, 2014\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fIt is a pleasure to be invited to participate in today’s conference. The Kansas City Fed’s\nseven-state district is home to some 900 banks with less than $1 billion of assets, which is 17\npercent of the nation’s small banks. With combined assets of about $150 billion, these banks\nrepresent just 1 percent of total industry assets. However, size comparisons understate their\nimportant contribution to the regional and national economy.\nCommunity banks in our region help finance farmers who contribute to 12 percent of the\nnation’s agricultural output as well as oil and gas businesses that account for 16 percent of\ndomestic energy output. These banks also are particularly critical for homeowners and business\noperators in rural areas because of their willingness to meet the demand for tailored, nonstandard\nmortgages and for small business loans.\nThere are more than 5,000 such banks in the United States. As the national economy\nstrengthens, community banks are prepared to resume their important role in their communities\nand the broader economy. However, they argue that the regulatory environment has thrown sand\nin the gears of efficiently and competitively meeting the credit needs of their communities.\nFour years ago, the regulatory reform known as the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) was passed.\nWith its aim squarely focused on addressing the supervision and regulation of the largest\nfinancial institutions, the law and its architects acknowledged that small banks were neither the\ncause of the crisis nor the target of reforms. And to that end, the DFA expressly exempted small\nbanks from its reach. So, why since then have community banks increasingly become concerned\nand vocal about regulatory burden as a threat to their ability to serve the credit needs of their\ncommunities and, ultimately, to their viability?\nThis growing chorus of concern and frustration about regulatory burden has gotten the\nattention of policymakers and regulators. Federal banking regulators all agree that calibrating\n\n1\n\n\fsupervision for community banks is appropriate and important, and they express genuine\nsympathy for the need to apply the right balance to the supervision and regulation of small\nbanks.\nYet, in spite of legislators’ and regulators’ best intentions, customers and communities\nthat rely on smaller banks for access to credit are feeling the weight of regulatory burden, and\nbankers are pleading for relief. Industry advocates have identified a number of specific remedies,\nand efforts are underway to consider how they might be implemented. For its part, the Federal\nReserve has likewise expressed its commitment to a deeper understanding of these issues,\nincluding its partnership with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors in this forum today. I\ncommend such efforts and look forward to the research insights and other learning from this\nprogram.\nIn my remarks today, I will offer my own views on the regulatory burden dilemma facing\nsmall banks, their regulators and legislators, and why it is proving to be so difficult to address in\na meaningful way. I will also offer my perspective on a way forward to ensure that regulation\nretains its objectives for public interest and the safety of the banking system. Before going\nfurther, I need to note that my comments today are my views only and not those of the Federal\nReserve System or its Board of Governors, which is charged with bank regulation\nresponsibilities.\n\nThe aim of regulation\nThe aim of bank regulation in the United States is both to protect the public and foster an\nefficient competitive banking system. Similar to the backdrop for the DFA, much of the U.S.\nregulatory system developed in response to financial crises and other events.\n\n2\n\n\fGenerally speaking, bank regulation is designed to protect depositors, ensure monetary\nand financial stability, provide for an efficient and competitive financial system and protect\nconsumers. It is not intended to keep banks from failing or to hinder banks from taking risks in\nmeeting the needs of their customers and efficiently allocating credit.1\nStriking an appropriate balance between regulation, banking and policy has always been\na struggle. In that regard, today’s environment is no different. Tension has long existed between\nallowing banks sufficient flexibility to adapt to a rapidly changing environment while\nmaintaining a regulatory framework that ensures financial stability and adequate consumer\nprotection.\nGetting that balance right is critical. History offers any number of examples of wellintended regulation resulting in unintended outcomes. For example, the 1999 Gramm-LeachBliley Act that allowed banking organizations to expand into nonbank financial activities aimed\nto allow banks to diversify and reduce risk. Instead, as we learned from the financial crisis,\nsubstantial increases in risk-taking, leverage and business-model complexity increased financial\nfragility.\nLikewise, the Basel capital requirements allowed the largest banks to use internal models\nto calculate their own risk weights for risk-based capital requirements, in part, “to build upon and\nfurther encourage investments banks are already making in their internal risk management\nsystems.”2 While the intent was to improve risk management and better align capital ratios with\nportfolio risk, the result was regulatory arbitrage and leverage ratios that proved inadequate\nrelative to the risks that many of the largest banks took leading into the crisis.\n1\n\nFor an in-depth review of the purposes of bank regulation as well as what bank regulation is not intended to do, see\nKenneth Spong, Banking Regulation: Its Purposes, Implementation, and Effects, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity, 2000.\n2\nSee William J. McDonough, “Implementing the New Basel Accord,” remarks to the Global Association of Risk\nProfessionals, Feb. 11, 2003.\n\n3\n\n\fGetting the right balance for banking regulation is not easy. Legislators and regulators\nface the growing challenge of regulating an industry that over the past three decades has become\nhighly concentrated and engaged in activities that range from traditional lending to complex\nfinance. While commercial banks of all sizes benefit from public safety nets, the operating\nmodels, activities, and risk profiles they employ vary widely. Indeed, community banks are not\nsmaller versions of the country’s largest banks. If our regulatory apparatus is going to effectively\nmeet its aims, policymakers must understand how these commercial banking business models\noperate and why a locally-owned community bank is not the same as a branch of a systemically\nimportant financial institution in meeting the credit needs of the local community.\n\nUnderstanding relationship banking\nThe community bank business model is often described as relationship banking.\nCommunity bankers typically have long-term, direct relationships with their customers that\nprovide the detailed knowledge about their character, reputation and history. This is necessary to\nmake informed, qualitative assessments about credit quality. These relationships allow\ncommunity banks to tailor loans and other services to their customers.\nMany community banks also are closely held institutions with the top management and\nboard members having significant ownership positions. These ownership incentives shape the\nbank’s culture and help to ensure that its key policymakers are focused on achieving good\nperformance, avoiding excessive risk-taking, and supporting the health of their communities.\nStudies by staff at our Reserve Bank on ownership and management structure find that the\n\n4\n\n\fbetter-performing and safer community banks are those where the major decision makers have\nmuch to lose if they do not make the right decisions.3\nI often hear that such a business model is becoming less economical in a world that is fast\npaced and increasingly transactions-based. However, research from our Reserve Bank presented\nhere at last year’s conference shows there is real value in relationship lending and in the soft\npersonal information on customers that community bankers typically have.4 This business model\nis one in which the incentives of banks are aligned with outcomes that benefit their customers\nand the economy. When incentives are aligned in this way, the need for an “ability to repay”\nrule, for example, seems unnecessary.\nAnother defining feature of community banking is its business model transparency.\nTraditional bank lending is inherently opaque because it is based on the inside, non-public\ninformation that bankers gain from their relationships with borrowers, but the business model\nneed not be opaque. In contrast to the largest banks, community bank shareholders, creditors,\ncustomers and regulators find it relatively easy to monitor and verify risks. Management\noversight and market discipline are much more effective with such a transparent business model.\nEmployees know what is expected; regulators are better able to thoroughly examine the bank,\nidentify risks and recommend appropriate corrective actions as needed.\nFinally, to understand the community bank business model is to understand that failure is\nan option when risks are poorly managed. This feature offers a powerful incentive to manage\nrisk. To be sure, community banks don’t always get it right, and history points to their failures,\n3\n\nRobert DeYoung, Kenneth Spong, Richard J. Sullivan, “Who’s Minding the Store? Motivating and Monitoring\nHired Managers at Small, Closely held Commercial Banks,” Journal of Banking and Finance, July 2001, pp. 12091243; and Richard J. Sullivan and Kenneth R. Spong, “Manager Wealth Concentration, Ownership Structure, and\nRisk in Commercial Banks,” Journal of Financial Intermediation, April 2007, pp. 229-248.\n4\nSee “Small Business Lending and Social Capital: Are Rural Relationships Different?” Robert DeYoung, Dennis\nGlennon, Peter Nigro, Kenneth Spong, presented at Community Banking in the 21st Century: A Community\nBanking Research and Policy Conference, October 2-3, 2013.\n\n5\n\n\fespecially during past periods of financial stress. Fortunately, an efficient resolution process is\navailable to minimize the cost to their communities and customers, maintain essential banking\nservices and retain public confidence.\n\nThe reality of the current regulatory environment\nThe business model of community banks no longer dominates the commercial banking\nindustry. Regulation has expanded to address the size, concentration and complexity of the\nlargest banks. Unfortunately, it also has impinged on thousands of community and regional\nbanks.\nThe issue is whether we can effectively achieve desired outcomes for all commercial\nbanks under the current regulatory framework, or whether we will try to further bifurcate the\nsystem with separate rules for the largest banks and community banks. We face a decision about\nthe path forward. Based on my own experience, I would offer three observations about the nature\nof today’s regulatory environment that weigh most heavily on community banks in the interest of\nframing potential remedies.\nMy first observation is that the rules are increasingly prescriptive and complex. In a\nglobal market for finance and commerce, regulators have responded to a larger, more\nconcentrated and complex banking industry with more complicated rules. However, the value of\nthis complexity is questionable. In the case of capital rules—a key component of regulation and\nbank safety—recent empirical and theoretical research shows that simpler capital rules are better.\nFor example, researchers at the Bank of England and Organisation for Economic Cooperation\nand Development have shown that simple leverage ratios are better than risk-based ratios in\n\n6\n\n\fpredicting default.5 Researchers at the Bank of England also have shown that theoretically\ncomplicated rules can lead to worse results when granular measures of asset risk do not account\nfor correlations among a bank’s asset portfolio or when models attempt to estimate risk\nparameters for risks that are unknowable.6\nLong before Basel III was adopted, community banks were considered well capitalized\nand their risks well understood. They remain so today. For example, banks with less than $1\nbillion of assets had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.5 percent in 1996, and today it is 10.5 percent.\nEven so, community banks must adopt the more complicated capital rules with finer degrees of\nrisk weights and capital buffers. The risk-weighted asset schedule of the call report has 57 rows\nand 89 pages of instructions yet no additional capital was required for the majority of community\nbanks.\nIn addition to the higher compliance costs associated with these capital rules, community\nbanks continue to hold higher levels of capital than the largest banks. Unless and until the largest\nbanks achieve commensurate levels of capital (inclusive of their off-balance-sheet assets), they\nretain a capital-ratio advantage over community and regional banks that is far more powerful\nthan the funding cost subsidy confirmed in a recent Government Accountability Office study.\nMy second observation is that regulation and supervisory frameworks have evolved with\nfar less reliance on examiner experience and supervisory judgment and more emphasis on datadriven, econometric models and measurement to produce a more systematic, objective and\n\n5\n\nSee Andrew Haldane, “Constraining Discretion in Bank Regulation,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Conference\non “Maintaining Financial Stability: Holding a Tiger by the Tail(s),” April 9, 2013; and Adrian Blundell-Wignall,\nPaul Atkinson, and Caroline Roulet, “Bank Business Models and the Basel System: Complexity and\nInterconnectedness,” OECD Journal: Financial Market Trends, Vol. 2014 – Issue 2.\n6\nSee Andrew Haldane in note 5 and David Aikman, Mirta Galesic, Gerd Gigerenzer, Sujit Kapadia,\nKonstantinos Katsikopoulos, Amit Kothiyal, Emma Murphy, and Tobias Neumann, “Taking Uncertainty Seriously:\nSimplicity Versus Complexity in Financial Regulation,” Financial Stability Paper No. 28, Bank of England, May\n2014.\n\n7\n\n\fstandardized approach to supervision. For the enhanced supervision of the country’s largest\nbanks, this approach has been considered highly successful, for example, in making assessments\nabout capital adequacy under stress test scenarios. However, for community bank supervision,\nthe substitution of rigid rules for examiner judgment has altered the supervisory process without\nadding value and has instead created higher costs of compliance.\nAppraisal requirements have been cited as an example in this regard. Over the last two\ndecades, the required use of appraisals has expanded in response to the 1990s savings and loans\ncrisis and the 2008 financial crisis. For real estate in larger metropolitan areas, market values can\nbe readily determined. For real estate in smaller communities, especially rural communities,\nthere may in fact be no “objective” market price. Despite this difference, appraisal regulation is\nrigid and restricts the kind of judgment-based lending that facilitates lending to small businesses\nand individuals in rural and other small community markets.\nMy third observation is related to the nature of consumer compliance regulation, and here\nI worry the pendulum has swung too far. To be sure, regulation has an important role to play in\nconsumer protection and fair access to credit. Those protections should not be diluted, especially\nfor banks that rely on model-based consumer lending. However, for banks that depend on\nrelationship lending with customized terms and conditions, the regulations and the focus on\nidentifying specific undesirable products seems to run counter to the requisite subjectivity that\nunderlies the strengths of community bank lending. Mortgage lending, UDAAP (Unfair,\nDeceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices), CRA (Community Reinvestment Act) and fair lending\nmust not only protect consumers from bad actors, but allow consumers to be served where\nsubjectivity is required. Unfortunately, I frequently hear community bankers expressing concern\nthat compliance reviews have taken a more prosecutorial tone. As one banker noted, these\n\n8\n\n\freviews have forced bank customers to prove they aren’t crooks and bankers to prove to\nregulators that they aren’t deceptive and unfair.\n\nMoving forward\nIn making these observations, I share the desire on the part of both bankers and regulators\nto find meaningful solutions. Community banks have become entangled in a web of reforms\nintended to address the risks in the largest banks. These reforms respond to a business model\nemployed by a few large, globally active banks, but have created spillovers for community\nbanks. Although it is enticing to contemplate the construction of separate rules and frameworks\nthat reflect these different business models and risks, commercial banks of all sizes remain\nbeneficiaries of a public safety net. For that reason, I believe community banks have a vested\ninterest in seeing that regulatory reforms move ahead to ensure that the largest banks are well\ncapitalized, well supervised, well managed and subject to failure. Achieving that end will serve\nthe public well. While that work is underway, regulators must also allow examiner judgment and\ncommon sense to play a greater role in their supervisory regimes for community banks.\nI’m often told that the world has become more complicated, that we have too many banks\nin the U.S. and that we cannot go back to less-complex and more-straightforward regulation and\nrules and greater supervisory judgment. I’m not convinced. One of the best responses to that\nassertion was from Sir Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England. Although his\nreference was made in the context of finding a solution to the issue of too big to fail, the same\nmight be said for addressing the regulatory environment more generally. He said, “There are\nthose who claim that such proposals are impractical. It is hard to see why. … What does seem\nimpractical, however, are the current arrangements.”\n\n9\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\n2014 Agricultural Symposium\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nKansas City, Mo.\nJuly 15, 2014\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fGood evening. We are delighted that you could join us for this year’s Agricultural\nSymposium. This program seeks to understand how recent developments in agriculture might\ntranslate to new economic challenges or opportunities in the months and years ahead.\nImportantly, the insights you bring from your respective industries, ranging from banking and\nfinance to the agribusiness, academic and government sectors, contribute to informed views of\nthese issues and play an essential role in the success of this program.\nThis is the fifth year we have hosted this symposium, which focuses on current and\nemerging issues in agriculture that affect the national and regional economy. Over the past year\nor so, we have seen some significant developments in agricultural markets as crop prices have\nfallen sharply and livestock prices set new records. As I travel throughout our district, I hear\nquestions about what the economic implications might be for a sector that is increasingly global.\nThis year’s symposium, “Structural Transitions in Global Agriculture,” seeks to address such\nquestions.\nMacroeconomic trends and monetary policy are broad forces that influence any industry\nfacing difficult decisions. In that respect, agriculture is no different. This afternoon’s\npresentations highlighted some of the macroeconomic forces driving demand for agricultural\nproducts and services, as well as how institutions are responding to general market conditions.\nAgainst this backdrop, I am pleased to share my views this evening on the outlook for the\nbroader, national economy and the transitions ahead for monetary policy. I will focus in\nparticular on the challenges associated with the transition from an extended period of ultra-low\nrates to a longer-run monetary policy framework. Of course, the views I am sharing with you\ntonight are my own.\n\n1\n\n\fEconomic Conditions\nThe economy has been growing now for about five years, though the pace has been\ndisappointing relative to past recoveries. And although many had optimistic growth projections\nfor 2014, we have yet to see evidence of a significant bounce. The year began with an unusually\nharsh winter and businesses that substantially pared inventories, which shrank economic output\nin the first quarter. Even so, the expansion remains generally solid, and I expect the economy\nwill continue growing at a moderate pace based on the progress we’ve seen in labor markets and\ninflation expectations that remain stable.\nThe labor market has made promising improvements. In 2011, the economy added about\n90,000 new jobs each month. The average this year has been more than 200,000, with broadbased gains across industries. As a result, the unemployment rate has dropped to 6.1 percent, its\nlowest point in nearly six years, and has declined over the past year at its fastest pace in three\ndecades. Although some of this decline reflects a lower labor force participation rate, broader\nmeasures of unemployment have also improved rapidly. For example, the unemployment rate\nincluding those working part-time for economic reasons or who consider themselves marginally\nattached to the labor force has fallen at its fastest rate on record.\nAnother positive aspect of the labor market is the number of job openings. There are\ncurrently more than 4.6 million posted job openings in the United States—about the same\nnumber at the peak of the last expansion. I continue to hear that firms are having difficulty\nfinding qualified workers. While finding good workers is always hard, they are becoming scarcer\nas the labor market continues to improve.\nInflation has firmed and its current pace is running slightly above the projections from\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). One factor is the rise in food prices, which is\ncause for some concern because food comprises a large share of lower-income households’\n2\n\n\fresources. Because these households spend nearly all of their income, any strain on their\npurchasing power from higher food prices results in weaker demand for other goods and\nservices.\nIn addition to food, rents in many parts of the country are also rising more quickly. Over\nthe past three months, rents have increased at their fastest pace since the end of the recession,\ndespite the rapid building of new apartments. With slower demand for homeownership since the\nfinancial crisis and tighter mortgage credit conditions, the pressure on rental prices is likely to\ncontinue.\nHigher food and rental prices pose particular concern in the face of modest nominal wage\ngains. Although some measures of wages are showing signs of moving higher, they are still\nbarely outpacing inflation. At the end of 2012, average hourly earnings had risen about 1.5\npercent year-over-year, but more recently have trended up to about 2.25 percent. As the labor\nmarket continues to strengthen, wages should begin to rise at a faster pace.\nBy the end of next year, I expect the economy will continue to grow and bring the\nunemployment rate to near its longer-run normal level with rising inflation. Accordingly, it is\nentirely appropriate to normalize the stance of monetary policy by bringing the current asset\npurchase program to an end and laying the groundwork for less accommodative and more\nsustainable monetary policy.\n\nThe appropriate level of short-term rates\nOver the past five years, the Federal Reserve has sought to offset the slower-than-usual\nrecovery through a variety of unconventional policies, such as asset purchases and forward\nguidance on short-term interest rates. In addition, short-term nominal rates have been near zero\n\n3\n\n\fsince the end of 2008—an unprecedented setting in the modern era of U.S. monetary policy.\nGiven the nature of the economic recovery, policymakers have relied on various benchmarks to\njustify a policy stance of near-zero interest rates. In contrast, many of those benchmarks now\nsuggest short-term rates should be above their current level—that is, the Fed should already be\nraising rates.\nSome argue that the nature of the financial crisis and slow recovery warrant a moreaccommodative interest rate stance than usual and is a reason to move more slowly than what\nthese benchmarks suggest. However, getting interest rates off zero relatively soon is not only\nappropriate in terms of current economic conditions, but also will allow the Fed room to\nmaneuver in the future should economic activity slow. As asset purchases come to an end, it will\nbe important to lay the groundwork for a more-normal rate environment. Adjusting short-term\ninterest rates in response to economic conditions is preferable to intervening in longer-term\nTreasury or mortgage markets. As a result, today’s economy, with a strengthening labor market\nand rising inflation, is ready for a more-normal rate environment. Furthermore, waiting too long\nmay allow certain risks to build that if realized, could harm economic activity without room to\nadjust rates in response.\nSuch risks, for example, come from the financial system’s efforts to adapt to a near-zero\ninterest rate environment. We have seen signs of reaching-for-yield behavior in the leveraged\nloan market, subprime auto lending and corporate bonds. In each individual market, perhaps, one\ncan find a justification for the lofty asset price valuations and aggressive lending practices—\nnevertheless, taken together, these patches of potential excess paint a picture of financial markets\nthat have become overly conditioned on high degrees of monetary accommodation. The low\ninterest rate environment has also pushed some savers who have traditionally relied on safer\n\n4\n\n\fassets into riskier securities. Questions are growing as to whether savers understand the risks\nassociated with carrying a riskier portfolio, especially those who are retired or nearing\nretirement. Finally, the VIX, a measure of expected changes in the stock market that is viewed as\na gauge of fear of large market movements, has lately been historically low. While a lack of fear\nin markets may sound positive, it is a sign that market signals may be dulled by excessively\naccommodative monetary policy.\nRecently, a fair amount of attention to the issues of financial stability have been focused\non whether monetary policy should address these imbalances with a rise in interest rates or\nwhether regulation associated with the newly embraced macroprudential approaches can suffice.\nUnfortunately, I expect neither offer perfect solutions. As I have noted in previous remarks,\nmonetary policy cannot distance itself from the incentives it has created and the effects of rates\nthat are too low for too long, and macroprudential supervision, for all its promise, is not yet a\nproven cure for excess risk-taking.1\nWeaning markets off of this unusually strong level of support will be challenging. But\npolicy needs to confront this challenge. Otherwise, expectations of ultra-low rates will persist\nand may become further entrenched. Expectations of low rates often go hand-in-hand with\nexpectations of low inflation and low growth. While low rates can benefit growth by\nencouraging households and firms to borrow and invest, this interest rate channel is only one\naspect of monetary policy and has proven to be less effective in the face of a deleveraging\neconomy. And by keeping rates unusually low, policymakers may signal pessimism that the\neconomy is not strong enough to begin moving to a more-normal rate environment. Moving rates\nup in line with improving economic fundamentals not only helps foster price stability in the\n1\n\nEsther George. “Current Monetary Policy and the Implication for Supervision and Regulation.” Remarks delivered\nat the Ninth BCBS-FSI High-Level Meeting for Africa.

The FOMC minutes from the last\nmeeting highlight the Committee’s discussion of the next steps in the normalization process,\nwhich include bringing the current asset purchase program to an end.\nOnce asset purchases are completed, the next step will necessarily involve raising shortterm interest rates, though the mechanics of how this will be done will differ from the past. Prior\nto the crisis, the mechanics of monetary policy would hardly be of much interest. The Fed would\nsteer short-term interest rates through relatively routine interventions in a narrow, overnight\nsegment of the money market composed primarily of depository institutions.\nToday, depository institutions rarely need to borrow in these overnight markets, primarily\nbecause the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase programs have flooded the financial system with\nliquidity. And because the level of reserves will most likely remain high at the time of liftoff, the\nCommittee may need to rely on new tools to raise rates.\nRegardless of the specific methods the Fed may use to control short-term rates, two\nimportant principles should remain at the core of how the FOMC approaches monetary policy in\nthe longer run. The first is returning to a Treasury-only portfolio. The Fed has engaged in the\npurchase of agency mortgage-backed securities, which specifically allocates credit to those\nseeking a mortgage. Such activities, in my view, are not appropriate central bank actions,\nparticularly in non-crisis periods. The second principle is a return to a policy framework of\n\n6\n\n\finfluencing short-term rates. Even if the Fed’s balance sheet remains elevated for some time, as\nit is likely to be, the FOMC should not use the balance sheet as a tool of monetary policy in noncrisis periods. That is, the Fed should return to its focus on controlling short-term rates and resist\nusing balance sheet policy to steer longer-term interest rates. In my view, attempting to directly\ninfluence longer-term rates is something a central bank cannot do with any precision, and thus\nrisks doing more harm than good.\n\nA steady path to exit\nExiting this unconventional monetary policy stance is necessary, but it will certainly pose\nchallenges. One possible bump could be a reemergence of volatility in financial markets.\nVolatility is not necessarily negative, as it often arises in markets during the price discovery\nprocess. Still, too much volatility could rattle confidence and affect financial markets in a way\nthat is detrimental to economic growth.\nShould financial market volatility increase, some may argue the FOMC should slow or\neven reverse any steps taken in the normalization process. While policy needs to respond to\nincoming data, adjusting policy to bursts in financial market volatility or in response to\ntemporarily soft data needs to be done with caution as stop-start policy reactions have\nhistorically produced poor economic outcomes. As a result, I see the economy as best served by\nsteadiness during the normalization process.\nThe approach for reducing asset purchases has been effective and serves as a good\nexample for the next phase of policy. The pace of the taper has been modest, at least by the\nstandards of the Fed’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet, but steady. The pace of asset purchases has\nbeen cut by $10 billion per meeting since last December, all while the Committee has observed a\n\n7\n\n\fvariety of data, such as a strengthening labor market, softening in the housing market and rising\ninflation. Even the rather sharp decline in first quarter real GDP was not cause to deviate from\nthe pace of reductions. This does not suggest that the pace of the taper is not data-dependent, as\npolicy will certainly adjust should an accumulation of evidence signal a change in economic\nconditions. Instead, the bar for altering the pace was relatively high. I see this steady approach as\nhaving helped policy resist the temptation to react to the latest data point. As a result, the\napproach has allowed continued progress towards normalization.\nNavigating the transition to less accommodative policy can be accomplished, but smooth\nsailing cannot be assured. History offers encouragement that the Fed can resolve to hold to a\nsteady course and reach its destination in spite of rough waters and headwinds. During the period\nfollowing the Great Inflation, former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker weathered tremendous\nadversity associated with the central bank’s response to high inflation. Necessary measures taken\nby Chairman Volcker were resisted both inside the Fed and publicly. Today’s economy and its\nissues may look very different, but the inevitable transition and accompanying adjustments will\ndemand no less resolve.\n\nConclusion\nAlthough the economic recovery following the crisis has been uneven, the economy has\ncontinued to grow over the past five years. The labor market appears to be moving into a higher\ngear. Inflation has also risen. As a result, many of the benchmarks that offer guidance on how to\nset interest rates suggest short-term rates should be higher than they are today. The transition to\nless accommodative and more sustainable policy will be challenging, though monetary policy\ndoes not want to find itself with a different set of problems that may arise by waiting too long. A\n\n8\n\n\fsteady path toward raising short-term interest rates, similar to how the Fed has approached the\nreduction in asset purchases, will serve the economy well.\n\n9\n\n\f"

George\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nBusiness and Community Leaders Luncheon\nBreckenridge, Colorado\nJune 3, 2014\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fI appreciate the opportunity to be here today with our Denver Branch Office Board of\nDirectors. Breckenridge provides an appropriate backdrop to discuss the current stance of\nmonetary policy as the Federal Reserve contemplates its eventual exit from unconventional and\nhighly accommodative monetary policy. Like skiers, our ability to anticipate what is likely to be\naround the next turn will make the difference between a smooth run down the mountain or an\nunpleasant spill.\nAs the U.S. economy gradually returns to normal, monetary policy will need to do the\nsame. My remarks today will focus on what it means to return to normal for economic conditions\nand for the stance of monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not those of the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNormalizing economic conditions\nMore than five years after the crisis and despite consecutive years of economic growth\nsince then, I still sense some hesitation in household and business confidence about the economy.\nClearly, sentiment has become more positive and hopeful over the past few years but remains\ncautious. Perhaps the Great Moderation made us too confident, and so, on the other side of the\nGreat Recession, we keep looking over our shoulder—not wanting to be fooled again.\nTurning first to the outlook, I anticipate the economy will continue to grow and\nunemployment to fall in the coming year. Although growth this year will likely be similar to last,\nthe factors driving it will be different and point to surer footing. For example, last year\ninventories provided a temporary boost to growth, whereas this year households and businesses\nare in a better position to spend and invest. As a result, demand for both products and services is\nlikely to rise, supporting overall growth on a more-sustained basis.\n\n1\n\n\fStronger growth, if it occurs, will certainly be welcome as the crisis and slow recovery\nover the past five years have posed many challenges to families, businesses and policymakers.\nSeveral issues still remain as the level of longer-term unemployment remains elevated, housing’s\nshare of overall economic activity remains low, and businesses still seem tentative in terms of\ncapital spending.\nDespite these issues, I think a return to more-normal economic conditions is on the\nhorizon. At the same time, we must remember normal is a range, and the economy will look\ndifferent this time around compared to other recoveries. Still, the unemployment rate is 6.3\npercent, which is less than 1 percentage point away from what the FOMC views as the longerrun, or normal, rate. If the unemployment rate falls at about the same rate as over the past few\nyears, the economy will reach this normal level by the end of next year.\nAnd although inflation has been low for a few years, it is not hard today to see examples\nof rising prices. Food prices have risen sharply over the past few months. People who rent either\na house or apartment are also seeing a steady rise in the rents they are paying. And having just\nmoved through the graduation season, I would note that the rise in tuition costs continues to\noutpace the price of many other goods. Because of these factors, I expect inflation to move\nnearer to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal.\nProjections from the FOMC also indicate that a return to normal is within the forecast\nhorizon. Based on the Federal Reserve’s economic projections, the unemployment rate is\nexpected to be at its longer-run level by the end of 2016. Inflation, as well, is expected to be near\n2 percent at that time. While I think we could achieve these levels sooner than these projections\nsuggest, it is noteworthy that these objectives are no longer beyond the forecast horizon.\n\n2\n\n\fNormalizing monetary policy\nAs the economy returns to normal, the Federal Reserve’s posture of extraordinary\naccommodation will need to shift to more-neutral settings. The timing and pace will have a\nsignificant influence on whether the economy experiences a hard or soft landing. Moreover, this\npath to normal is not a familiar one. Efforts by the central bank over the past five years have\nbeen unprecedented, and its process of normalization is likely, in many respects, to lack familiar\nrhythms.\nWith the elevated size of the balance sheet, one issue is simply “how” interest rates will\nbe increased when the time comes. Some aspects of this discussion relate to the mechanics of\nhow the Fed actually changes interest rates, but other aspects relate to how large a footprint the\nFed should make in the nonbank financial system as a result of its overnight reverse repos. The\nsteps that the FOMC takes in preparation of the first rate hike also are in focus.\nTo be sure, the FOMC has done some planning along these lines. Going back to June\n2011, the FOMC agreed on a number of key elements of a normalization, or exit, strategy. At the\ntime, the plan was to first cease reinvesting some or all payments of principal on the securities\nwe hold. This action would cause the balance sheet to begin shrinking without having to sell any\nbonds from our portfolio. The next step of the 2011 plan was for the FOMC to modify its\nforward guidance on the path of the federal funds rate—that is, the signals we provide about how\nlong we anticipate short-term rates will stay near zero.\nAt that time, the plan called for taking steps to reduce the amount of reserves held in the\nbanking system. Currently, banks hold about $2.7 trillion in reserves, compared to only around\n$10 billion prior to the crisis. The elevated level of reserves reflects the bond-buying programs,\noften referred to as “QE 1, 2 and 3.” As a voting member in 2013, I did not support the last round\n\n3\n\n\fof bond-buying, partly because of the complications these actions have for normalizing monetary\npolicy.\nFollowing these steps, the 2011 plan then called for the FOMC to begin raising its target\nfor the federal funds rate, provided economic conditions were approaching normal. From that\npoint on, changing the funds rate target would be the primary means of adjusting the stance of\npolicy, and other tools, such as the interest rate paid on reserves and the adjustments to the level\nof reserves in the banking system would be used to bring the funds rate toward its target.\nThe final aspect of the 2011 strategy was to return the balance sheet to a more-normal\nsize and composition. Of course, getting back to an all-Treasury portfolio of normal size will\ntake some time. In 2011, the size of the balance sheet was approximately $2.5 trillion. Today, the\nFederal Reserve’s balance sheet is approaching $4.5 trillion, so some aspects of the 2011 plan\nwill likely need to be revisited. In fact, the FOMC reviewed this plan last year and considered the\n2011 principles broadly as still applicable. However, the FOMC has noted that when it becomes\nappropriate to normalize monetary policy, the details of the process would depend in part on\neconomic and financial developments and that it would communicate its intentions as that time\napproaches.\nA decision the FOMC will need to make in the relatively near future, however, is what to\ndo with the balance sheet after the end of the “taper”—that is, after the current round of bondbuying comes to an end. I think allowing the balance sheet to decline due to “passive runoff,”\nwhich stops reinvesting the maturing securities, prior to the first rate hike is appropriate. As the\noutlook improves, this modest step would begin the normalization process and is in line with the\n2011 principles. Unless there is a major change in the outlook, I see abiding by principles that\n\n4\n\n\fthe FOMC reaffirmed last year as important. Central banks should make efforts to follow\nthrough on their plans, otherwise they risk losing credibility.\n\nLingering headwinds and rates in 2016\nTightening monetary policy is difficult, and history offers examples when such steps\ncame too late. Cutting rates is easy when economic activity is slowing and inflation falling, but\nraising rates can be more difficult as the economy strengthens. This is especially true if the\nsignals of sustainable growth are not entirely clear cut. While some have argued the aggressive\neasing actions taken during the crisis required courage, both from a policy and political\nstandpoint, I expect the normalization phase will require a great deal more. Accordingly, sending\nthe appropriate signals and communicating is clearly important so that tightening policy is not a\nsurprise.\nOne current issue is that even as the economy moves back toward more-normal\nconditions, the FOMC has signaled that monetary policy is still some time away from\nnormalizing. For example, the FOMC’s projections show the federal funds rate below its longerrun level at the end of 2016, even though economic conditions have normalized. As I noted\nearlier, I expect the economy could be there a bit sooner.\nOf course, this recovery has been slower than normal. Lingering headwinds reflecting\ntight credit conditions, uncertain and restrictive fiscal policy, and uneven growth across the\nglobal economy have affected the pace of recovery.\nFor monetary policy, some are concerned that these headwinds could linger into 2016,\njustifying a low policy rate to offset their effects. I think it is hard to see such persistent\nheadwinds still weighing on the economy two years from now, unless some new shock causes\n\n5\n\n\feconomic activity to slow. Take, for example, fiscal policy, which has been tight during this\neconomic recovery. In particular, last year’s tax increases and the sequester cuts in government\nspending put a dent in economic growth in 2013. However, the effects of this fiscal restraint are\nfading this year, so fiscal policy is unlikely to be a persistent headwind going forward. Credit\nconditions also have been tight, although they have eased since the end of the recession.\nConsumer borrowing, for example, has recently stepped up. Growth in certain types of credit,\nsuch as in leveraged lending and subprime auto loans, is an area of concern.\nAs the headwinds weighing on the recovery thus far start to fade, policy may need to\nreact sooner than what is suggested in the FOMC’s projections. However, once policy\nnormalization begins, a gradual rise in the federal funds rate toward its longer-run level will be\nimportant and promote financial stability. Steady moves are more predictable and reduce the\nchance of unexpected shifts in longer-term interest rates.\nA gradual path for the federal funds rate is suggested by the FOMC’s projections.\nHowever, in my view, it will likely be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate somewhat\nsooner and at a faster pace. My concern is that keeping rates very low into late 2016 will\ncontinue to incentivize financial markets and investors to reach for yield in an economy\noperating at full capacity, posing risks to achieving sustainable growth over the longer run.\n\nConclusion\nAs the economy continues to recover and moves toward sustainable growth, so monetary\npolicy must step away from its extraordinary influence. A gradual withdrawal and clear\ncommunication are key to a smooth transition, allowing markets to resume a greater role in credit\nallocation and pricing of risk.\n\n6\n\n\fThe challenge for monetary policy is to converge on this path in a timely fashion,\nfacilitating a return to normal and achieving its long run objectives for the economy.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMid-America Payments Conference 2009\nKansas City, Missouri\nOctober 29,2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fIntroduction\nI am pleased to have an opportunity to join you today at the conclusion of this year's\n\nMid-America Payments Conference. We have had a long association with the Kansas City\nClearinghouse, MPX and now EPCOR, as we share a focus on improving our nation’s payments\nsystem and ensuring its benefits accrue to financial institutions and their customers here in the\n\nheartland.\n\nAs I begin my remarks today, I want to emphasize that I am expressing my own views,\nand they are not those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs you know, our payments system is going through one of the most radical\ntransformations since the advent of the ACH network more than four decades ago. The result is\nnot only a payments system that is much more complex in its operation, but also in the\n\nchallenges that it faces and the risks to its integrity.\nIn response to this evolution, central banks around the world are thinking about how they\n\ncan continue to maintain an efficient, safe, and accessible payments system, hi the United States,\none key question going forward is what role the Federal Reserve can and should play in this new\n\nenvironment. While some in the industry and government advocate a reduced presence, I believe\n\nthere is a strong case for the Federal Reserve Banks to continue active involvement.\n\nChanges Prompting Rethinking of the Fed’s Role\n\nSince their founding almost a century ago, the Federal Reserve Banks have played a role\nin the nation’s payments system. Charged with ensuring its efficiency, safety and accessibility to\nthe public, this mission remains as important as ever.\n\n2\n\n\fThe payments system today is very different than the one that was hi place in the early\n\n1900s. But more striking is how far removed it is from what we saw only a few years ago.\n\nConsumers have embraced debit and credit cards as the preferred form for payments. Paper\nchecks, when written, are converted to electronic form and cleared via ACH or Check 21\nnetworks. Today, paper checks represent only 2 percent of the total deposited with Federal\nReserve Banks. By the end of the year, the Federal Reserve will have closed all but one of its\n\npaper check handling sites. The Federal Reserve helped drive this move to electronics and the\n\npublic benefits are clear. For example, the aggregate fees paid by financial institutions to the\n\nFederal Reserve Banks for check collection will have declined from about $700 million in 2005\nto less than half that amount by next year.\n\nWhile check clearing volume has been declining for a decade, ACH transaction growth\nbegan to flatten about a year ago. Whether that represents the temporary effects of the recession\nor is the result of a structural change, the past rapid growth rates that we have seen in our ACH\ntransactions are unlikely to continue at such a pace.\n\nMeanwhile, debit card transactions have continued to increase, even during the recession.\n\nWe have also seen the growing presence and influence of nonbank providers of payments\n\nservices. For example, firms like PayPal and Amazon are introducing the capability for software\ndevelopers to apply their front-end payment solution to make online purchases for specific\nmerchants wanting to control the buying experience. Mobile access to the Internet is projected to\nexpatrd rapidly with implications for the positioning of financial institutions, telecom networks,\n\nand technology firms in the payments chain.\n\nAs we step back and take a broad look at these developments hr retail payments, it is\nperhaps striking how much of the growth is taking place in the private sector with little\n\n3\n\n\fregulatory oversight. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have not played as active a\nrole in the operation or oversight of card networks, the fastest growing portion of retail\npayments. Many nonbank providers of payments products and services have little, if any,\n\noversight of their operations. If this continues, it will create a significant vulnerability for our\npayments system.\n\nFor many in the industry, the success and profitability of payments providers is a\ntestament to the superiority of market solutions outside the Federal Reserve or regulatory\nenvironment. “Why mess with success?” I am asked. While in the short term this may seem\n\nobvious, I want to remind you that this was also said about subprime lending, complex financial\nproducts and commercial real estate guidelines only a few years ago. It is the nature of highly\n\nprofitable private providers to oppose regulation and increased competition. However, in today’s\nenvironment, and based on recent experience, it seems clear that the central bank will be held\n\naccountable for the safety and accessibility of a reliable payments system. If consumers are\novercharged or disadvantaged, or if the system comes crashing down everyone will ask. “Where\n\nwas the centr al bank? Why didn’t it protect the public and the financial system?”\nSo yes, candidly, I do question whether the private sector alone can provide a safe,\ncompetitive and efficient payments system over the long term.\n\nEconomic Rationale for a Government Role in Retail Payments\nIn general, most economists believe that markets work well in most circumstances. The\nexceptions arise when there are externalities or other forms of market failure. Examples are when\nthere are interdependencies among market participants that lead to important spillover effects or\n\n4\n\n\fwhen scale economies lead to the emergence of a small number of industry providers with\n\npotential market power.\nMany payments markets have a number of these features, and I would like to highlight\n\nthree that seem especially important in assessing the need for central bank involvement in retail\npayments. First, payments markets are networks, and economic studies of networks suggest\n\nthere can be severe coordmation problems that may inhibit their growth and development. These\n\ninvolve difficulties in creating standards and in undertaking large startup capital expenditures.\nSecond, because of externalities and spillover effects, networks may under invest in\n\nsecurity as individual participants look fust to their own profitability and do not consider system\nintegrity as a whole. We are all well aware of the recent rise in major information breaches and\nidentity theft in the retail payments system. I would note that many of these instances have been\n\ncentered at nonbank payments providers.\n\nThird, because of scale economies, payments systems and electro me payments systems in\nparticular, tend to have a small number of providers, raising concerns about market power and\nnoncompetitive pricing. In the United States, we have seen a trend toward increased\n\nconcentration in debit card networks, with a decline from 43 debit networks in 1995 to 13 in\n\n2007. Indeed in 2007, the top three debit card networks (PIN and signature) handled 8 8 percent\n\nof total transactions and Visa alone had a market share of almost 64 percent. As consolidation\nhas occurred, we have seen significant increases in interchange fees, a development that has not\ngone unnoticed by the public and government officials around the world.\nIn light of these issues, I think a strong case can be made for continued central bank\n\ninvolvement in retail payments. The key questions at hand focus on the nature of central bank\n\n5\n\n\factivities and, especially, how these activities should evolve to meet the changing structure of the\n\nretail payments industry.\nHistorically, the Federal Reserve’s involvement in retail payments has centered on\n\novercoming coordination problems that have inhibited efficiency. In this regard, I believe the\nFederal Reseive's position as an operator has allowed it to be an effective catalyst and facilitator\nfor payments modernization.\n\nFor example, in the early 1970s, as bankers, regional payments associations, and the U.S.\nTreasury struggled with the increasing volume of check payments and related costs, the Federal\nReserve collaborated with the industry to build the automated processing systems and\n\ndistribution network that would become the ACH. And, in 1984, the Federal Reserve provided\nthe impetus for industry adoption of another major innovation by applying digital image capture\ntechnology to the backroom of the check processing business, again in response to a need from\n\nthe U.S. Treasury to reduce the costs of microfilming checks it issued. As you know, this\n\ninvestment was later leveraged to establish check image exchange networks.\nIn each of these endeavors and others, we have worked closely with the industry and\nCongress to develop legislation, standards, technology and procedures to overcome the severe\n\ncoordination difficulties that prevented the private sector from moving ahead on its own. Even\ntoday, we continue to leverage our operational role in ACH. For example, we’re working with\nindustry stakeholders to address problems such as how to more efficiently and safely exchange\npayments internationally with low volumes now, but growing volumes in the future. And we are\nworking to introduce faster ACH clearing with a same day settlement capability, which we\n\nexpect to roll out in the first half of next year.\n\n6\n\n\fFinally, I would be remiss if I did not emphasize that hi times of crisis, the Federal\nReserve’s operator role has served to minimize the impact to public confidence that would occur\nwith major disruptions to the retail payments system. In the hours and days following the Sept.\n\n11, 2001 attacks, the Federal Reserve Banks were in a position to keep the check collection\nsystem operating despite the disruption to air transportation. While the probability of disruptions\n\nis low, crises will happen sometime in the future and I believe the Federal Reserve’s operator\nrole enhances the resiliency of our retail payments system.\nIn the future, the Fed's traditional role of catalyst and facilitator may be less needed\n\noutside of ACH. After all, card networks have developed and prospered without Federal Reserve\ninvolvement, and the innovation introduced by nonbank payments providers has been\n\nimpressive.\n\nThoughts on the Federal Reserve Banks' Future Role in Retail Payments\nIn my view, a starting point for considering the Federal Reserve's future role is to\nconsider whether the safety and efficiency of retail payments will be enhanced by the central\n\nbank’s continuing presence.\n\nAs I indicated earlier, it is not clear to me that the private sector will make sufficient\ninvestments to maintain the safety and integrity of retail payments without some sort of Federal\nReserve or government pressure. Consequently, I believe it is important to ask whether the\n\nFederal Reserve, as a traditional, trusted provider of secure payments services, can play a role in\n\nhelping to enhance the security of the retail payments system and reducing identity theft. More\nbroadly, I think it is important to consider the extent to which nonbank providers of payments\n\n7\n\n\fservices pose systemic risks to the retail payments system and to explore how they, along with\ntraditional providers, might be more effectively monitored by regulatory oversight programs.\nI also think that the Federal Reserve could play a role in enhancing the competitive\n\nefficiency of the retail payments system by leveraging its operational role in ACH to provide a\n\nplatform for clearing all forms of debit transactions. Note that I am not suggesting the Fed issue\ndebit or credit cards, but rather, that the Federal Reserve provide a cost effective alternative to\nmoving and clearing debit transactions, and as a systemic backup to the private sector - a role it\n\nhas played in payments since nearly its founding. Such an approach may require additional\ninvestments in and enhancements to the FedACH network. Some may disagree, but looking\nback, the Federal Reserve’s role in check payments did not drive competition out, but assured\n\nbroad, safe access in a more competitive environment, to the payments system.\nAs I have floated this idea over the past year, I have received feedback from some who\ndisagree. However, we need to think about the effects of the likely alternatives. As I indicated\nearlier, concern about noncompetitive pricing of payments services and market power have\n\nemerged around the world. This has led to significant government interventions in market pricing\nand market practices hi a growing number of countries. The course taken in many of these\ncountries has been to subject the card networks and market participants to greater oversight and,\n\nin some cases, to direct government involvement in interchange pricing. As you know, similar\n\nbills are pending in Congress.\nMy own view, like that of many economists, is that government involvement in direct\n\nprice setting in any industry is fraught with problems in implementation, generally leading to\n\npoor outcomes and unintended consequences. At the same time, noncompetitive market\n\nstructures and pricing, if present, do need to be addressed. One alternative, of course is greater\n\n8\n\n\fantitrust enforcement. My suggestion is somewhat different, to increase competition via the\n\nFederal Reserve’s role in retail payments, specifically as an operator of the ACH network. Of\n\ncourse there may be other means of making noncompetitive markets more contestable, which\nalso should be considered.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, the retail payments system is evolving rapidly and is more complex than\n\never. It saves as a critical component to the infrastructure of the economy. The Federal Resave,\nworking closely with financial institutions and the industry as a partner and competitor has been\n\nan important driver of efficiencies and current levels of safety and stability. However, the growth\nin payments transactions is now occurring in card networks, and nonbanks’ presence is growing.\n\nSome may call for the Fed to exit retail payments now that physical distribution is no longer\nneeded and its share of retail payments transactions is naturally declining. However,\n\nconcentration in card markets, increased concerns about security and reliability, the unintended\n\nconsequences of regulation versus Fed participation hi these markets, and the success of the Fed\nin sparking industry innovation from its position on the ground, lead me to conclude that Fed’s\npresence as an operator is needed now more than ever.\n\n9\n\n\f"

            "content": "Regulatory Reform and the Economy:\nWe Can Do Better\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nDenver, Colorado\nOctober 6, 2009\n\n\fI want to thank you for attending this evening’s Economic Forum, hosted by the Denver\n\nBranch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. When Congr ess created the Federal Reserve\nin 1913, they believed very strongly that the nation’s central bank could not be an institution\nisolated inside Washington. Instead, they recognized the importance of distributing the Federal\n\nReserve’s responsibility broadly across the nation, creating regional Federal Reserve Banks that\nserve specific regions of the country. The regional Banks and Bank Branches, like the one here\nin Denver, are under the direction of local boards. Our directors play a key role in connecting the\n\nFederal Reserve and its policy deliberations directly to the communities we serve. We have two\nDenver-area directors on the Kansas City office’s board, and the seven-member Denver board\n\nincludes four Denver-area directors. I would like to recognize how important these Coloradans\nare to the success of our work and thank each of them for their service to our nation’s central\n\nbank.\n\nCHALLENGES\nIn the past when I have spoken at this program, my comments have focused almost\n\nentirely on the economic outlook. In that regard, I can tell you that I see nothing that conflicts\nwith the widely held opinion that we are in recovery. Consumer confidence is rebounding, and\nwe are starting to see improvement in business and manufacturing. Additionally, yield spreads\nbetween low-risk assets, such as Treasuries, and higher risk assets are nanowing. They are not at\n\nprerecession levels, but there is a clear indication that investors are more willing to provide\ncapital, which is extremely important. A vast amount of stimulus has been put in place to spark\nthis recovery, and I believe it will prevent a double-dip recession.\n\nThe stimulus will, however, present its own challenges. The Federal Reserve and other\n\ncentral banks around the world will have to unwind the extensive policy accommodation used to\nhalt the economy’s decline. That will be a delicate process because removing too soon could\n\nreturn the economy to recession while waiting too long will foster an inflationary spiral. The\n\nprocess will be particularly delicate for this recovery because it will proceed slowly, hampered\nby a significant debt overhang and uncertainty around the condition of some of the largest\n\nfinancial institutions. Thus, the challenge to monetary policy is to act in such a manner that you\nencourage the recovery while not fostering conditions for a future crisis, albeit one of a different\n\nnature.\n2\n\n\fAs policy is discussed and even debated, it is important to note that the current fed funds\n\nrate is zero. We all know that the neutral rate is not zero. Equally obvious to me is that a rate of 1\nor 2 percent is not tight monetary policy - it is still very accommodative. As we consider our\n\nchoices, I would not support a tight monetary policy hr the current environment, but my\n\nexperience tells rue that we will need to remove our very accommodative policy sooner rather\nthan later. Even if we were to start immediately, much time would pass before incremental\n\nincreases could be considered tight or even neutral policy.\nMonetary policy, however, is not the only area where we will have to consider the long­\n\nterm implications of our actions as we emerge from this crisis. In that regard, I tliink the best use\n\nof rny time here this evening will be to explain why I think the hard decisions are ahead in the\n\narea of regulatory reform, which is cunently under consideration in Congress. Looking at some\nof the policy issues that have emer ged hi recent weeks, it seems the public debate continues to\ndistract from what I judge was the primary cause of tins crisis. We must address the issue of too\n\nbig to fail or we will repeat the mistakes of the past, with ever-worsening consequences. I know\n\nwe can do better.\n\nREGULATORY REFORM\nToo Big to Fail\n\nReform in the regulation and oversight of our financial system clearly is needed. As sur e\nas we know that tomorrow will arrive, we know that a financial crisis will occur again at some\n\ntime in the future. Therefore, the most important exercise that we should undertake now is to\n\nensure that problems at large financial institutions are not allowed to jeopardize the basic\nsurvival of our financial system and economy.\n\nHow do we do that? How do we prevent incentive compensation schemes that cany high\ncosts to taxpayers? How do we best protect the consumer from unfair and deceptive practices by\n\nfirms that are currently unregulated or under-regulated? While the Administration has taken an\n\nimportant initial step to address these lapses in our- financial system, it is focusing first on\nsymptoms rather than the disease.\n\nAdam Smith is often thought of as the English-speaking world’s father of modern\neconomics. He is widely known for his book titled, The Wealth of Nations, in which he provided\n\n3\n\n\fhis analogy that a market economy was like an invisible hand guiding resources to their best use.\nLess well-known is another passage in that book in which he warns that:\n“The interest of the dealers ... is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to. that of the\n\npublic. To widen the market and to narrow the competition is always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market\nmay frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be\n\nagainst it. and can serve only to enable the dealers, by raising then profits above what they naturally would be. to\nlevy ... an absurd tax upon ... their fellow-citizens. The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which\n\ncomes from tills order ought always to be listened to with great precaution.... It comes from an order of men whose\n\ninterest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to\noppress the public, and who ... upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.”\n\nTo get a sense of what Adam Smith is talking about, I would point out that in 1999 the\n\nCongress passed a piece of legislation, heavily endorsed by our largest banking firms, called the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This legislation ended the separation of commercial and investment\n\nbanking. It broadened the market and allowed for the accelerated growth of large financial films\n\nin the United States, turning them into institutions that were thought to be “too big to fail.”\n\nTills should not be dismissed as a populist view of these institutions, but one that is\nsupported by the data. It is best seen by examining the advantages that accrued to these firms\n\nwith respect to then- capital levels. The market, knowing these firms were too big to fail,\ntolerated an ever-expanding leverage ratio, relative to owner equity. For example, if you look at\n\nthe 20 largest institutions, their equity-to-assets ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2009 was\n\nabout 4.3 percent. If you look at the next smaller group of institutions, their equity-to-assets ratio\n\nwas almost 6.5 percent. The smaller institutions simply must cany lower leverage ratio because\nall those in the market - management, shareholders and creditors - know they will lose their jobs\n\nand investments if they make decisions that cause their banks to fail. This type of market\n\ndiscipline is less immediate to the owners and creditors of the larger films.\nIf you were to place these largest institutions under the same leverage constraints as the\nsmaller firms - at least 6.5 percent equity to asset - these larger firms would need to raise more\nthan $275 billion in new capital or shrink their assets by more than $4 trillion. Tins capital\n\ndifference is an overwhelming advantage to these largest firms and, indeed, has enabled them to\nnarrow the competition to an incredible degree. Since the change in law, the largest 20 films\nhave increased their control of the nation’s banking assets from about 35 percent to an\n4\n\n\fastonishing 70 percent. Even more striking perhaps is the fact that some of these firms are now\n\n30 to 40 percent larger than they were when this crisis began, and as yon know, many of these\nfirms were protected during the crisis.\nWhen the crisis unfolded and these largest firms were at risk of failure, Congress passed\nthe $700 billion TARP legislation. It was done to protect the broad economy, but it also had the\nadditional effect of institutionalizing too big to fail in the United States.\n\nCompensation\nOne of the ironies of this action is that the management of these firms, even those\nneeding TARP funds to survive, continues to receive enormous compensation packages. As a\n\nresult, one of the issues currently distracting Congress and the public is executive compensation.\nI certainly understand the anger directed at the well-paid individuals atop large firms that\n\ncontributed to this crisis. However, a comprehensive plan for resolving these firms and\ndismissing management, rather than protecting them from failure, would address compensation\n\nissues far more effectively because it would leave these individuals out of work and wipe out any\nownership stake they hold. That does much more for accountability than simply capping an\n\nindividual’s pay. In fact, there is some question if pay caps could even be firmly implemented as you may know some firms have already begun to work around compensation limits by raising\n\nbase salaries to million-dollar levels.\n\nCompensation restrictions also call into question the tenants of capitalism in terms of\nbalancing risk and reward. If we ensure that our resolution system makes management bear the\n\ncosts of the bad decisions and risks they take, we also need to let them reap the rewards of the\ngood decisions. At the very least, new kinds of market distortions might be created by injecting a\n\ndegree of disconnect between compensation and performance - the same kind of disconnect that\n\nsome might suggest fosters the type of carelessness we saw in this crisis.\nLet me give you one example. Let’s say one of the largest financial institutions wanted to\n\npay a trader a $100 million bonus based on performance. I’m not a trader, but I know there is no\nway to earn enough money on trading to generate a $100 million bonus without taking open\n\npositions, which in this example is making bets on behalf of a company that has a major role in\nour nations’ payments system. If the trader wins, the company makes money. If the trader loses,\ntaxpayers fund the bailout because the institution is large and systemically important. Ure real\n5\n\n\fproblem with this scenario is that the company is too big to fail, not that they are willing to pay\n\nan enormous sum of money as a bonus. If it's their money, or the money of their shareholders or\n\ncreditors, I am in favor of letting them set compensation levels. If if s the money of U.S.\ntaxpayers, then if s an outrage. Mandating an orderly receivership if the institution fails assures\n\nthat they gamble with their own money.\n\nIt is also important to acknowledge that policing such an executive compensation policy\nwill be difficult and inconsistent. For those who are angry about individuals profiting obscenely\nfrom a crisis, it will do nothing to prevent that. Many investors did so during this crisis by rightly\n\ninterpreting that the government would bail out failed institutions and that the stock prices would\nrecover. Heads I win, tails the public loses is a one-way bet. It's not capitalism; it is bad policy.\n\nOnce again, I suggest that ending too-big-to-fail is the first step in addressing compensation\nissues.\n\nConsumer Protection\n\nAnother headline issue in the regulatory reform package relates to the proposed\nConsumer Financial Protection Agency. Fair treatment of consumers is extremely important. We\ndo a lot of work throughout our District on consumer education and consumer issues. Our Bank\n\nalso hosts a nationwide call center on behalf of the entire Federal Reserve System. Consumers\n\ncan contact us by phone1 - and they will talk to an actual person, not a machine - or online at\nwww.FederalReserveConsunierHelp.eov to discuss problems related to any financial institution,\n\nregardless of the regulatory agency involved. These calls are extremely illuminating in what they\n\ntell us about the relationship between consumers and financial institutions. First of all, we handle\nabout 40,000 consumer questions a year, which suggests a lot of concern and often confusion\nabout consumer rights under the law. However, 90 percent of the complaints we receive are\ntargeted on the largest banks and most often related to credit card issues. Very few complaints\nare made against community banks. And, after these complaints have been investigated, few\n\nagainst conununity banks are actually found to involve violations of the consumer protection\nrales. This suggests that clarification or simplification of consumer protection rales may be\n\nnecessary for consumers to better understand what dieir protections are under the law.\n\n1 888-851-1920\n\n6\n\n\fI think we also need to recognize that, while effective consumer protection is a critical\n\nfoundation of our financial system, weaknesses or gaps in the enforcement of these laws was not\nthe only factor, or even the driving factor, behind the run-up of subprime lending and the\nresulting wave of foreclosures. What we experienced was a distortion of incentives in financial\n\nmarkets amid inflated real estate prices, skyrocketing demand for mortgage backed securities and\na resulting deterioration in underwriting standards for many lenders as they rushed to originate\nmore Ioans. These dynamics caused too many loans to be extended without a reasonable\n\nprobability of repayment. The consequences were, of course, disastrous when the housing market\ncollapsed. This experience raises important questions about the incentives involved in\nsecuritizing loans, the ability of consumers to receive a loan with little or no upfront money, and\n\nthe role of nonbank firms, among other issues. There are also lessons to be learned about the\n\nscope and effectiveness of consumer protection laws, as well as the expectations for regulators\nenforcing these laws.\nThere are more discussions and debates to take place on this topic, and it is the choice of\n\nCongress to decide. My experience tells me, however, that comprehensive oversight of banks is\n\nimportant for both effective and efficient supervision. Under the coordinated approach we\ncurrently utilize, our goal is to create a good outcome for consumers and depositors through\nensuring a financially sound and well-managed banking operation that complies with specific\n\nconsumer protection rules. Separating those functions will create inefficiencies in information\n\ncollection and analysis, and add an additional layer of communication and coordination.\nBut in any case, the fact remains that the consumer and the public more generally will be\n\nbest served if we address the root cause of the abuse that many unfortunate consumers have\nsuffered during the crisis. We must change the incentives and enhance the accountability of the\ninstitutions that generated the complex products that served the principle goal of generating fees\n\nrather than being sound Ioan products.\n\nSolution\n\nMany times in the last year I have expressed my astonishment that Congress was able to\napprove $700 billion in TARP fluids in approximately one week and yet 18 months have passed\n\nsince Bear Steams was acquired by JPMorgan and there is still no resolution authority for the\nlargest financial firms.\n7\n\n\fFailure resolution for these largest firms and other yet-to-be-defined systemically\n\nimportant films is part of the proposed reform package now before Congress. Unfortunately, the\nproposal does not adequately address the too-big-to-fail problem in that it still provides too much\n\nlatitude to rescue failing firms. It confirms the practice of addressing failure of the largest firms\nin an ad hoc manner with individuals rather than the rule of law deciding which firms get rescued\n\nand which do not. As eager as we might be to address the shortcomings of our financial system,\n\nwe must also be carefill to get it right.\nWithout mandatory resolution authority directed under “the rule of law” for the largest\nfilms, financial reform will be incomplete and ineffective. Management will remain able to game\n\nthe compensation programs that we define, and consumers will be subject to higher fees and\n\nunfair treatment, even under a new regulator, should it come to be. There can be no confidence in\nthe system until there is a sense of fairness in the treatment of institutions whereby management\n\nand investors are held accountable for their decisions regardless of their film's size. We all know\nthe names of these firms. They were central to this crisis as it expanded and became a global\n\nrecession. However, while the crisis caused workers to lose their jobs and families to forfeit their\nhomes, the stockholders and creditors of these films enjoyed special protection funded by the\n\nAmerican taxpayer.\nTo begin with, the legislation needs to establish a mandatory, non negotiable resolution\n\nprocess for too-big-to-fail firms that are no longer viable as a going concern due to insufficient\ncapital or liquidity. With appropriate legislation, failing films could still avoid liquidation or a\n\ndrawn-out bankruptcy process. Instead, they would be put into receivership or conservatorship so\nas to provide an orderly process for maintaining essential services and avoiding systemic\n\ninstability while making management, shareholders and creditors accountable for their decisions.\n\nThe resolution process would apply to every financial institution whose problems might threaten\n\nfinancial or economic stability and is involved in the “plumbing” of the financial system - that\nis, those involved in the payments system and the provision of liquidity within the financial\n\nsystem.\n\nA resolution process where creditors bear losses commensurate with their investment\ndecisions would be significantly less costly to the taxpayer than the price we are currently paying\n\nin lost jobs, lost economic growth and actual outlays of public funds. Alternatively, if we do not\n\nfind a way to end too-big-to-fail, the largest institutions retain an inequitable competitive\n8\n\n\fadvantage, will continue to escape market discipline and are incented to engage in practices that\nultimately harm the financial system.\n\nA sound resolution process would provide greater assurance of equitable treatment for all\nparties, which is essential in a democratic, capitalist system. As a nation, we will soon need to\naddress other enormous financial challenges, such as reducing the budget deficit and providing\nfuture funding for Social Security and Medicare. We must not fool ourselves that citizens will or should - accept higher taxes or reduced benefits until we have addressed existing\nvulnerabilities in our financial system that risk public funds.\nTo those who say that some firms are too big to fail, I wholeheartedly agree that some are\n\ntoo big. However, these firms can be unwound hi a manner that does not cause ineparable harm\n\nto our economy and financial system but actually strengthens it for the long run. As a regulator\nduring the banking crisis of the 1980s. I was involved in closing hundreds of failed institutions.\n\nContinental Illinois, which was one of our nation’s largest and most complex bank holding\ncompanies, was taken into receivership is an orderly fashion.\nI have testified before Congress on this issue and recently offered a detailed process that\n\nwould hold the ownership and senior management of these institutions accountable for their\nactions when their firms fail. The businesses would then be restructured through a prescribed\n\nprocess under the rule of law. If you are interested in the details of this plan, I encourage you to\nvisit our website, uw.KansasCitvFed.org, where you can review it in its entirety. I am not\naware of any other proposal that would prevent situations like Bear Steams, Lehman Brothers\n\nand Merrill Lynch from being handled exactly the same way. That is unacceptable.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhile some argue that moving legislation quickly forward gives us a better outcome\nsooner, my view is that this approach will result in a set of unintended consequences with a more\nexpensive outcome. I have no doubt that all policymakers involved in the debate have the same\n\ngoals of benefitting the consumer, the industry and the nation’s economy. That is why I believe\nthe full package of regulatory reform deserves more time for careful consideration and national\ndebate, but resolution authority is well over a year too late. The likelihood of real success in\n\nfinancial stability; consumer protection; and; importantly, public confidence in policymakers’\n\n9\n\n\fresolve to fix what actually went wrong in our financial system starts by addressing too-big-tofail.\n\nI know that this is a difficult problem to fully understand, and certainly will be a\n\ncomplicated situation to fix. But we must fix it. Based on experience, my view is that we do not\nhave to subsidize or “learn to live with” the financial oligarchy that exists. Furthermore, our\n\nhandling of too-big-to-fail institutions will define the future role of the United States hi the\nglobal economy. Our failure to insist on a stable, market-based financial system jeopardizes the\n\nU.S. leadership position.\n\nto\n\n\f"

This text was prepared from a transcript of Mr. Hoenig’s remarks.\n\n\fI want to thank the Kansas Bankers Association for inviting me here today and for giving\n\nme the opportunity to speak on what I consider to be increasingly important challenges\n\nconfronting our economy in the coming months and years. The challenges are focused around\nthe common theme of debt and leverage as it impacts the banking industry, government, business\n\nand consumers. How we address these challenges will also affect how the Federal Reserve\nconducts monetary policy as we emerge from this recession and beyond.\nI’ll start by focusing on the banking industry and the challenge of too-big-to-fail. The\n\nmatter of a resolution process for failed large banks must be addressed before the financial\nsystem can be fully healed and functional. Then I will speak on the broader issue of debt, federal\n\ngovernment, business and consumer, and the challenges it presents for policy. These topics are\nimportant because, as citizens, we have some very difficult choices before us that will impact us\n\nand future generations.\n\nThroughout my presentation, I will share a number of charts that illustrate the magnitude\n\nof debt and leverage in the economy.\n\nThe advantages of too-big-to-fail\nChart 1 is a picture of leverage in the banking system and illustrates the enormous\n\nadvantage of being too big to fail. For example, at the end of the first quarter of this year, the 20\nlargest financial institutions in the United States controlled more than $12 trillion in assets,\nsupported by more than 3.5 percent equity capital. This chart illustrates how little equity supports\n\nthat massive amount of assets and risk. The next group of financial institutions, the non-top 20\n\nfinancial institutions ($500 million to $100 billion in assets) has an equity capital ratio of 6\npercent—notably higher than that of the largest banks.\n\n\fChart 1\n\nTier 1 Common as % of Total Assets\n\nSource: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated Condition [March 20091\nNotes: Graph includes only BHCs that filed the Y9-C which excludes approximately $2 trillion in assets.\nTier 1 Common = Tier 1 Capital less Preferred Stock, Related Surplus and Minority Interest.\nNon-Top 20 includes bank holding companies with $500 million to $100 billion in assets.\n\nAssume for a moment that the 20 largest institutions were required either to raise new\n\nequity, or to reduce their total assets to meet the 6 percent equity capital ratio. This would\nrequire that they raise more than $300 billion in new capital or, as Chart 2 shows, they would\nneed to shrink in size by $5 trillion, or some combination of the two options. The numbers in\nChart 2 make clear how much of an advantage the larger institutions have over smaller banks,\n\nand show the excess leverage the largest banks have accumulated.\n\n\fChart 2\nTotal Assets Supported by Existing Tier 1 Common Supported\nAssets assumes 6% Tier 1 Common to Total Assets\n\nSource: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated Condition | March 2009]\nNotes: Tier 1 Common = Tier 1 Capital less Preferred Stock, Related Surplus and Minority Interest.\n\nIt is no longer conjecture that the largest institutions in the United States have been\n\ndetermined to be too big to fail. They have been bailed out, and proposed legislation allows for\nthat practice to continue. They have an implied guarantee, which affords them an enormous\n\nadvantage in terms of their use of leverage and their ability to accumulate assets to\nunprecedented levels.\n\nThe large banks have added capital since the end of the first quarter, but they are far short\nof achieving a 6 percent ratio of equity capital to assets. Ironically perhaps, some proposals\nbeing offered would require large institutions to hold more than this level of capital. I would\n\n\fsuggest such proposals are wishful thinking, and will not be achieved. I would be pleased if\nthese largest institutions were held to the same standards as the non-top 20 firms because the\n\ncommunity banking system cannot survive if the largest banks continue with their current\n\nadvantage, and that obviously has significant adverse effects for the financial system as a whole.\nThere were two pieces of legislation that facilitated our migration toward too big to fail.\n\nChart 3 illustrates the relative growth in position of the largest institutions against the timeline of\n\nInterstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which permitted banks to grow across\n\nstate lines, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which eliminated the separation of commercial\nbanking and investment banking. Since 1990, the largest 20 institutions grew from controlling\n\nabout 35 percent of industry assets to controlling 70 percent of assets today. This trend will\n\ncontinue unless we take specific steps to end it.\n\nThe way we normally address failure in a capitalistic system is to subject any institution,\nfrom the largest institution to the smallest, to the same penalties for bad management. To\naccomplish this, we must pass legislation mandating that institutions that become insolvent, due\nto liquidity or capital, be taken over in an orderly fashion and placed under a conservatorship or\nreceivership. In such an instance, both the equity holders and long-term debt holders should\n\nshare the losses before the taxpayer is required to bail out the institution. Taking over the failed\ninstitution in an orderly fashion—not a panicked fashion—would protect the franchise and, more\n\nimportantly, protect the economy from instability.\n\nAs I have described elsewhere, a resolution framework can be designed that is fair and\nmuch more efficient for the economy. As we have handled the largest institutions through this\n\ncrisis, they are not market-driven institutions, they are public utilities. This has to change or we\n\n\fwill not retain the dynamic financial system that has made the United States so successful over\n\nits history.\n\nCharts\nIndustry Concentration in Top Bank Holding Companies\n\nSources: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated ConditionParent Company Only Financial StatementsConsolidated Reports of Condition and Income\n\nNotes: *Riegle*Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency' Act of 1994 allowed for interstate acquisitions\n\nDifficult choices\n\nWhile staying with the theme of debt and difficult choices, I am going to turn next to the\nchallenge of the growing debt levels within our economy and the challenges they present for\n\nmonetary policy makers, starting with federal debt levels.\n\n\fIt is the responsibility of us citizens, through our congressional representatives, to decide\nhow much our government spends and how we allocate those expenditures, which nominally\nincreased to $3 trillion in 2008 from less than $500 billion in 1975. Medicare, income security,\n\nSocial Security and veteran’s benefits make up more than half of government spending. Federal\n\noutlays also include national defense, education, interest payments on the debt and other\nexpenditures. These expenditures are substantial, and they may grow further as we set forth on\nimplementing a stimulus package and tackle some very difficult health-care issues. Both these\ninitiatives involve legitimate goals, and it is not my place here to debate the merits or the\n\narguments surrounding them. However, as Chart 4 shows, we need to understand that we,\nthrough our government, have already made significant long-term commitments and choices in\n\nallocating federal resources.\nChart 4\n\nSource OMB. Dara for 1975 is the average for 1974*1976, data for 1985 is rhe average for 1984*1986,\nand data for 1995 is rhe average of 1994-1996- The number on the right is the percent of outlays.\n\n\fIf our government is going to spend a total of $3 trillion a year, it must obtain the\nrevenues to do so. If we are not willing to tax ourselves, then funds must be borrowed. Chart 5\nshows that in nominal terms, the total federal debt has grown from less than $500 billion in 1975\nto approximately $12 trillion, and over that same period, our debt-to-GDP ratio has increased\nfrom 35 percent to 90 percent. We are spending 8 percent of our total federal budget just to\n\nmake the interest payments on that debt, and that too will only increase.\n\nCharts\nTotal Federal Debt\n\nEnd of Fiscal Year\nSource: OMB, BEA, calculation.\n\n\fWhile our federal debt level is significant, we must consider more than the government’s\ndebt as we evaluate the economy. Chart 6 shows that consumer and nonfinancial business debt\n\nare each now more than 130 percent of our national income. Consumer leverage has actually\n\nworsened as consumer wealth has declined during this recession due to the collapse in housing\nand the decline in U.S. equity markets.\n\nChart 6\nDebt\n\nIn an environment where debt is large and growing, low interest rates are preferred by\nnearly everyone: the government, bankers and bank customers. The desire for low interest rates\n\nwill put incredible pressure on the Federal Reserve and the central banks of the world to keep\nrates low. Since Paul Volcker broke the inflationary cycle of the late ’70s and early ’80s, Chart 7\n\n\fshows that there has been a sustained downward movement of the federal funds rate—which\naffects interest rates broadly—and this has encouraged the use of debt to finance a broad range of\npurchases. Consequently, we are carrying more debt than we have carried in most of our\n\nhistory, and the pressure to keep rates low is only going to increase as the economy begins to\n\nrecover from this recession.\n\nChart?\nFederal Funds Rate\n\nChart 8 shows that low interest rates have coincided with a growing level of money in the\neconomy, which the Federal Reserve defines as M2. Chart 9 suggests further that this growth in\n\nmoney over these past several decades has had a staggering effect on the consumer price level.\nSince the founding of the Federal Reserve some 95 years ago, the consumer price level index has\n\n\frisen to a level of2200 from a level of 100. That’s an astonishing increase in the general price\nlevel, and it represents a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the dollar over time.\n\nThese are matters that demand our attention as we make choices involving both fiscal and\n\nmonetary policy.\n\nCharts\nMoney\n\nSource: Board of Governors. Money is defined as M2, a broad set of financial assets held principally by households. M2 consists of die sum of (1) currency, (2) traveler’s checks,\n(3) demand deposits, (4) other checkable deposits, (5) savings deposits, (6) small-denomination rime deposits, and (7) balances in retail money market mutual funds.\n\nIn considering these charts and the matters of policy, we should be aware of two pieces of\nlegislation that I suggest influenced their contours: the 1946 Employment Act and the 1977\n\nAmendment to the Federal Reserve Act. The 1946 Employment Act established as a national\n\npriority a goal of low unemployment. Low unemployment is a worthy goal and one that I share,\nbut it cannot be achieved by systematically keeping interest rates low. In 1977, Congress passed\n\nthe Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act—also called the Humphrey-Hawkins Act—which\n\n\fcalled upon the Federal Reserve, as the central bank of the United States, to pursue a dual\nmandate of promoting long-run stable economic growth and stable prices.\nChart 9\nConsumer Price Index\n\nThough I am convinced we can achieve both mandates, I also am convinced that both are\n\nonly possible if the first priority of the central bank is to achieve stable prices. Understandably,\n\nhowever, many prefer that the emphasis be on growth and low unemployment. Although the\nFederal Reserve is insulated from politics, it is not isolated from politics, as you can observe by\nthe frequent congressional testimony of Ben Bernanke and past chairmen. The Federal Reserve\n\nSystem is accountable to Congress for achieving the dual mandate, and the data suggest it has\n\ngiven important deference to the growth objective.\n\n\fRecession and recovery\nThese issues provide context for the monetary policy choices that lie ahead. Based on the\ndata we are receiving today, it would appear that we are at the bottom of the recession. The data\nare mixed, which is usually a sign that we are at the bottom. However, these mixed data also\nmake it difficult to determine just how firmly or quickly we will emerge from the recession.\nGiven the large amounts of consumer, business and government debt that will influence events\n\ngoing forward, I suspect we’re going to recover slowly. The recovery will be assisted by the\nfiscal stimulus and an accommodative monetary policy, but it most likely will be slowed by the\nextensive rebalancing of the economy that has yet to occur.\nIn this environment, one of the Federal Reserve’s major challenges will be how to pull\n\nback its highly accommodative monetary policy without undermining the recovery and not\nigniting inflationary expectations. We learned in the Great Depression and with the Japanese\n\nexperience that we have to pull back gently. At the same time, however, we also learned from\nthe great inflation of the ’70s that we have to be resolute in pulling excess stimulus back or risk\ngreater consequences in the future. We are going to be walking the “knife’s edge” for some time\n\nto come.\n\nIn considering this challenge it is important also to realize first that more than half of the\n\ncurrent fiscal stimulus package has yet to be spent, so we have yet to see its full effects. In\n\naddition, monetary policy remains exceptionally accommodative and will provide significant\nstimulus into 2010 and beyond.\n\nFocusing more narrowly on monetary policy, the excess reserves in the banking system\nnow exceed $800 billion; they were less than $8 billion when this recession started. The balance\n\nsheets of the Federal Reserve Banks have increased from $900 billion to more than $2 trillion in\n\n\fless than two years. As we become more confident that we are at the bottom of the recession and\nare moving into recovery, we must become more resolute in systematically reducing our balance\nsheet and raising interest rates to levels we might all agree are more in line with the economy’s\n\nlong-run growth path. Moving from zero to one percent, for example, is not a tight policy. I\ndon’t know what the neutral rate is, but I am certain it isn’t zero.\n\nIf the monetary stimulus does not come out, the price level trend shown earlier in Chart 9\nwill only worsen. As a reminder of what that might imply, you need only study the early ’80s\nwhen high inflation undermined our economic system. Paul Volcker’s efforts to bring inflation\n\ndown then were not without cost and required that the country suffer through a recession nearly\nas bad as the one we hope we are exiting now.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf the government, the banks and consumers address the difficult issues of debt and the\nFederal Reserve begins to remove the significant stimulus in an orderly fashion, then we will\ncome out of this recession without an inflationary hangover. Noninflationary growth will follow,\n\nnew wealth will be generated, and we will continue to be the strongest, most successful economy\nin the world. But in the short run, these actions will involve painful choices, and it is the\n\nresponsibility of citizens like you, and policy makers like me, to consider the impact of today’s\n\nchoices on tomorrow. We must choose well.\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\n“Bankruptcy and the Financial Crisis”\nStem School of Business, New York University\nNew York, N.Y.\nJune 30, 2009\n\n\fIntroduction\nThank you for inviting me here today for what is an especially timely discussion.\nThose who are familiar with my public remarks know that I do not accept that some firms\n\nare “too big to fail.” I do not believe it's inevitable or desirable to continue to have too-big-to-\n\nfail financial institutions because they pose an ongoing threat to financial stability. Now is the\ntime to seriously consider a mandatory resolution process based on an objective set of criteria\n\nthat puts the largest financial organizations on notice they won’t receive a disproportionate\nsubsidy or guarantee.\n\nWhen the financial crisis was unfolding, public authorities responded with a number of\n\nad hoc steps. These actions kept afloat several large financial and nonfinancial firms whose\ncollapse many thought would prove devastating to the financial system and the economy. The\n\nnames of the institutions are well known: AIG, Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and\nMerrill Lynch. There were also initiatives to support financial sector Finns through TARP\nmoney.\n\nWith few exceptions, the steps taken to support these firms were outside the normal\nframework established to deal with troubled entities. Hie related actions raise important\n\nquestions around too big to fail and whether traditional corporate bankruptcy procedures and\nbank receiverships are adequate to the task of resolving failed firms. The options chosen also\nraise important issues of fairness and the equity of outcomes. We know that public assistance\n\ninvolves political choice, which too often undermines market discipline and the process of failure\n\nand renewal so essential to the long-run success of our capitalistic system.\n\n2\n\n\fIn my remarks this afternoon, I will discuss the role that I believe bankruptcy and bank\nreceivership authority must play in a financial crisis, the lessons we should learn from our recent\nexperience, and what steps we should put in place to deal with future disruptions.\n\nThe resolution of depository institutions and corporate bankruptcies\n\nManaging insolvency for depository institutions differs markedly from what we do with\n\nmost other corporations. Although we have many experts here on both bank resolution and\n\ncorporate bankruptcy, I would like to briefly compare these approaches before discussing issues\naround the resolution of large failing institutions.\n\nOur approach in dealing with insolvent banks is largely based on the idea that because\nbanks serve a critical role in the payments and credit systems, their failures involve potential\n\ncostly externalities. Bank failures, of any size, could lead to significant disruptions in the ability\nof individuals and businesses within a community to carry out timely transactions. Furthermore,\nif the largest institutions are involved, these disruptions could bring about a systemic breakdown\nin financial markets and cause substantial harm to the overall economy.\n\nThe primary focus in bank resolutions is to protect depositors at the least cost to the\n\ninsurance fund and, wherever possible, ensure continued access to banking services with\nminimal disruption to the overall economy. This requires timely action. As such, bank\n\nresolutions occur under an administrative process with the FDIC acting as receiver. The FDIC\n\nhas a number of “superpowers” it can use in its role, including the ability to reorganize or\nrestructure a failed bank, sell portions of the bank's assets and operations, and repudiate certain\ntypes of claims and contracts.\n\nOverall, the bank resolution process moves quickly through prescribed steps.\n\n3\n\n\fThe failure of nonfinancial corporations involves a more deliberative process. Although\nthe failure of these firms may have a significant effect on individuals and economic outcomes,\nthey do not pose the same type of liquidity and systemic issues as the failure of a bank.\n\nConsequently, the resolution process differs in some important ways from that of banks; most\n\nnotably the resolutions are handled through the bankruptcy courts and are initiated either by a\nfirm’s creditors or its managers. The court process concentrates on maximizing the value of the\n\nfnm and the creditors’ claims either through the film’s liquidation or as an ongoing concern.\nBankruptcy courts, moreover, could be characterized as part of a “time out” process in which\nneutral judges work with creditors and other parties to resolve conflicts of interest and protect\n\ncreditors.\nDespite the differences in these two processes, there are important commonalities as well.\n\nIn both cases there is a strict set of procedures established under the rule of law that sets out, for\nexample, a “priority of claims.” Also, both focus on an orderly process and equitable outcomes\n\nwith care being taken to minimize political factors that might otherwise interfere with the\n\nresolution process.\n\nLessons to be learned\n\nAlthough we have a legal framework for dealing with failing institutions, we have\nlearned that, in a crisis, the “systemic spillover” that can emerge from failures of our largest\n\ninstitutions and the threat to the broad economy require additional consideration. The most\n\nrecent examples of this have led to the suspension of normal bankruptcy and bank resolution\nprocesses, thus institutionalizing the concept of too big to fail in our economic system.\n\n4\n\n\fEven outside of the banking system, major securities firms and AIG, an insurance\ncompany, were thought to be systemically significant because of their many connections and\nexposures with other firms and markets. Therefore, it was concluded they could not be put\n\nthrough bankruptcy. Many view the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and its aftermath as a\njustification for bailing out other large financial institutions.\nBut we have also learned, or been reminded, that too big to fail has adverse consequences\nas well. Eveiy financial crisis leaves a trail of losses embedded among market participants. The\n\nprocess of recovery must start with the recognition of these losses, which then must be\ndistributed among the participants. Moreover, in some instances the extent of the losses\n\nultimately requires the recapitalization or closing of the institutions and the replacement of the\nmanagement responsible for the failure. When exceptions are made to tills process for any set of\ninstitutions, especially our largest, this process of recovery is delayed or compromised. In\n\naddition, taxpayers most often must bear the burden of recapitalizing too-big-to-fail institutions,\nplacing billions of dollars of their funds at risk. And too often, the management who created the\n\nproblems or who failed to demonstrate the leadership necessary to properly run the institution\nremains in place.\nSuch interventions tend to break down market discipline and involve public authorities,\n\nnot the market, choosing winners and losers. In FDIC receivership or bankruptcy, instihitions\n\nand claimants must deal with using tested procedures and a set of rules that help ensure that all\nparties, regardless of size, are heated comparably. With too big to fail, this process is suspended\n\nand films are heated differently based on one criterion: size.\n\n5\n\n\fThus, while in the middle of a crisis, short cuts to tested resolution processes may appear\n\nand even be necessary, they almost certainly leave us with a less efficient and less competitive\n\nmarketplace.\n\nWhat steps should we take?\n\nAs policymakers consider the administration’s recent proposal for a new resolution\nauthority for systemically important financial institutions, it is crucial that we ask ourselves\n\nseveral important questions. For example, given what we have learned from this crisis, how can\n\nwe address the issue of systemic vulnerability that is inherent in any system with institutions\n\nallowed to be too big to fail? How can we better assure that managers, stockholders and\ncreditors know that there will be a credible system that puts them at risk? And how can we\n\nresolve large institutions without raising systemic concerns or disrupting key financial activities\nor markets? I suggest there are three fundamental steps to addressing the matter of too big to\nfail.\n\nFirst, there needs to be a set of basic rules of performance that apply to systemically\nimportant institutions. I would emphasize that these rules need to be easily understood and\nenforceable. For example, I strongly support simple leverage standards for setting capital\nrequirements at financial institutions. Leverage restrictions, once assigned, are simple to\n\nunderstand and calculate. They are straightforward to enforce and, if enforced appropriately, are\ncountercyclical. Risk-based capital standards, in contrast, are complex, procyclical, and easier to\n\navoid. Many institutions, in fact, have significantly underestimated their risk exposure over the\nlast few years. These errors could have left them with even greater capital shortages if they had\n\nbeen free to follow a tine risk-based capital approach. While no system is perfect, clear and firm\n\n6\n\n\frules are easier to understand and enforce. Principles-based oversight is an exercise in\n\nphilosophy, not a supervisory framework.\nSecond, there must be a clearly defined resolution regime for systemically important\n\nfirms that are in financial trouble. When addressing serious problems, such a regime should set\nforth fundamental steps that ensure a continuity of key operations but which also carefully\n\nconfine policymakers from making special exceptions to a defined process.\n\nSome have well illustrated the responses associated with the recent crises to an\nemergency crew acting to save a burning home before it destroys the entire neighborhood. I\nagree that acting to save the neighborhood was important. However, to extend the metaphor, if\n\nthe fire was started by a homeowner who ignored fire codes and smoked in bed, should the\n\nneighbors be required to rebuild the home at twice its original size at their expense?\n\nWhile we could have addressed the too big to fail issue with current tools, a statutorily\nsanctioned resolution process would significantly improve our ability to deal with failed large\nbank holding companies and large nonbank financial institutions. The Treasury Department’s\n\nplan for Financial Regulatory Reform and its resolution regime for failing bank and other\n\nfinancial holding companies provide a starting point for discussing the issue of too big to fail\ninstitutions, but it is only a start.\n\nIn the proposal there are a number of issues that deserve careful consideration. They\ninclude, for example, how solvency recommendations would be determined among the\nconsolidated and financial subsidiary regulators. Also, the process will need to be much more\nspecific in how we determine which institutions and activities would be regarded as systemic and\n\ncome under the federal safety net or public protection. For example, I would limit such\n\nboundaries to those institutions that are directly and indirectly part of our economy’s plumbing:\n\n7\n\n\four system for payments and for the provision of liquidity. Inside these boundaries would be all\n\nbanks and bank holding companies and any institution that has direct access to the payments\n\nsystem and to the Federal Reserve discount window. On the other hand, hedge funds would be\n\noutside the boundaries of the safety net, although they could be required to register and report\nunder SEC rules. The plan must also more precisely define how the cost of resolving a large\ninstitution would best be distributed. Such costs are substantial and should be allocated to those\n\ninstitutions that benefit the most from the public safety net.\nThe most important part of any plan, however, will be the requirement that public\n\nauthorities resolve such institutions by taking them into receivership and restructuring them to\nemerge under new and more careful management and ownership. This step should be taken\n\nwhenever the chartering and supervisory authorities judge an institution to be insolvent horn a\n\nliquidity or balance sheet perspective, and I would advocate no exceptions. If a resolution\n\nprocess exists, then few, if any, exceptions will be necessary.\nUnder the pressure of a crisis, as we have seen, it is difficult to avoid a piecemeal\n\napproach to dealing with systemically important institutions with all of the unintended\n\nconsequences that seem to follow. Thus, our energies in refining the proposed legislation should\nfocus on how best to narrow the exceptions and assure that a receivership or bankruptcy\n\nframework operates according to the rule of law and insulated from political interference. In\n\nbanking, Congress has set the receivership rules with independent regulators making solvency\ndecisions and carrying out the resolution process. A similar format must be part of the resolution\n\nprocess for systemically important, large financial organizations.\n\n8\n\n\fThird, in resolving issues around any failed firm, especially too big to fail firms,\nmanagement and stockholders must be accountable for their actions. Restructured firms must\n\nhave new - and more careful - management and ownership.\nToo often institutions drift without a clear vision of the organization’s goals with no one\n\nmaking the hard decisions. Other shortcomings include a failure or unwillingness to understand\nthe financial instruments the institution holds, relying on mechanics rather than sound judgment.\nToo often management has a greater concern for expanding the balance sheet than for managing\n\nexistirrg activities. Within today’s largest organizations, we have learned of individuals who\nwillingly carried a hefty title for the purpose of representation of the organization but with no\n\nunderstanding - and no requirement or desire to understand - the business lines, operations or\ncondition of the organization. From the volume of complaints blaming rating agencies for the\n\ncurrent crisis, it seems that far too few senior executives in these largest organizations believed it\n\nwas their responsibility to understand the financial products their company was buying and\ntrading in quantities of billions and trillions of dollars. This is not only unacceptable, but also a\ndereliction of duty.\n\nDealing with leadership issues is challenging and should be addressed by respective\nboards and stockholders. But if a board fails to do so, then the company’s likelihood of failure\n\nincreases. When failure occurs, certainly new management must be required as part of any\n\nresolution process. One might observe that a CEO and his board of directors are hardly in a\nposition to be angry with any government-imposed restrictions on compensation when they\n\nneglected their responsibility to manage a sound company.\nA final point that needs to be highlighted is that there must be confidence in the fairness\nof any resolution process if it is to be successfill over time. Capitalism works only if all\n\n9\n\n\fcompetitors are held to the same standard and have equal opportunities to succeed or fail. With\n\ntoo big to fail, capitalism is compromised and equity of opporhmity is sacrificed to expediency.\n\nThe vast majority of banks in the United States have complied with regulations and\nrequirements that, though necessary, are costly. These banks have played by the rules or suffered\n\nthe consequences of not doing so during market turmoil. Understandably, today these smaller\ninstitutions are concerned about the prospect of increased regulatory requirements and an\n\nincreased competitive advantage that flows to the largest firms. Such an outcome would\nundermine confidence in the market system that has brought this country past success.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe current crisis has made it clear that the group of systemically important firms that\nmight be deemed worthy of special consideration by policymakers is larger than previously\nthought. Tlris extension of the too big to fail concept, along with the wide variety of public\n\nassistance and guarantees we’ve seen used in recent months, make it even more important that\n\npolicymakers find ways to deal with large failing institutions.\n\nFailing to have a process that operates according to the rule of law and is free of political\n\ninfluence means an even larger section of our financial markets will operate on the assumption\n\nthat the idea of failure - a key element in market discipline - does not apply in all instances.\nOnce this happens, it will be difficult for other institutions to survive and compete, and for our\nmarkets to be competitive and efficient. Importantly, it will not be realistic for any authority in\nany regulatory structure to oversee a system where incentives remain to take on excessive risk.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nSheridan, Wyo.\nJune 3, 2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors,\nofficers or representatives.\n\n\f2\n\nThank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak with you here in Sheridan today. It is\na pleasure to be here, and it has been a genuine opportunity for the directors and staff of the\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to learn first hand what is happening in this part of our\nregion.\n\nIn thinking about the long run while contemplating the current economic situation, I\nwould humbly amend the famous observation of economist John Maynard Keynes. In the long\nrun, we are all dead but our children will be left to pick up the tab. With that in mind, today I\nwill focus on some of the longer-run challenges we face as we emerge from the current financial\n\nand economic crisis. These challenges can most certainly be dealt with, but they require that we\nbegin now to address them genuinely and systematically or we risk repeating past mistakes and\n\ncreating an environment that leads to our next set of crises.\n\nNear-term outlook\n\nI’ll begin my remarks by stating that my view of the more immediate outlook for the U.S.\n\neconomy is that we will emerge from this recession - perhaps as soon as the second half of this\nyear, but most likely in early 2010, as many economists project. If for no other reason, the\n\neconomy should respond positively to the significant degree of monetary and fiscal stimulus that\n\nhas been directed into the economy over the past several months. Let me briefly describe those\nactions.\nMonetary policy is enormously accommodative, with the fed funds rate being near zero.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s lending programs and support of the housing market provides significant\n\nadditional liquidity and stimulus to our financial markets and economy. The Federal Reserve is\nin the process of purchasing longer-term assets including Treasury securities, which adds\n\n\f3\n\nsignificant stimulus. In total, these actions will increase the Federal Reserve Banks’ combined\nbalance sheets to more than $3 billion from less than $1 trillion less than two years ago.\n\nFiscal policy also has been highly expansionary and will provide billions in stimulus over\nthe coming quarters and years. For example, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) placed\n$700 billion into die financial industry and parts of the auto industry just within the past eight\n\nmonths. The fiscal stimulus package recently implemented into law provides nearly $800 billion\n\nin tax cuts, grants to state governments, expanded jobless benefits and significant infrastructure\n\nspending on highways and other transportation enhancements, and on clean energy initiatives\nthat are unprecedented in size and scope. Frankly, it would be surprising if the economy failed to\nrecover based on the magnitude of these monetary and fiscal programs.\nDespite these actions, I expect the recovery to be more modest than some economists\n\nproject. The U.S. economy is working through a series of difficult structural adjustments, as are\n\nmarry of our trading partners. Our financial institutions remain fragile and will require significant\nadditional amounts of capital to regain then stability. How we choose to do this will affect the\n\npublic’s confidence in these institutions and their ability to support the recovery. The housing\nmarket continues to struggle as it downsizes from past financial and speculative excesses and the\n\nassociated misallocation of resources. Consumers are adjusting to a significant loss in wealth\nassociated with the declining housing and stock markets, and job losses. Recovery in these\n\ncircumstances will take time and require patience if we are to avoid mistakes in our efforts to\nbring the economy forward.\n\nThus, while I am convinced that the economic recovery we all want will develop, it will\n\nbe slower and more fragile than we hope for.\n\n\f4\n\nFixes for the long run\nThis recession is often described as the worst in post-World War II history, and that may\n\nvery well be correct. From it will flow a host of policy issues that will require careful review and\nhard choices if we are to assure our national economy’s long-term strength and vitality. In this\nregard, I would like to direct the remainder of my remarks to three policy issues: the need to\naddress fundamental weaknesses within our financial system; the need to address significant\n\nimbalances within the U.S. economy; and the need to act to avoid an inflationary outbreak that\ncould come with current fiscal and monetary policy.\n\nThe financial system\n\nOver the past year, we have seen the U.S. financial system nearly collapse. Financial\ninstitution failures have included Bear Stearns, Fannie and Freddie, and Lehman Brothers.\nMeanwhile, billions of dollars in taxpayer money have been needed by CitiGroup, Bank of\n\nAmerica and AIG. The panic that followed these events affected the broader economy,\nworsening the current recession. It is apparent that we need a better set of incentives within the\n\nindustry and better oversight by the regulatory authorities if we are to avoid a repeat of these\n\nevents in the future. Moreover, if we hesitate to make needed changes, we will perpetuate an\n\noligarchy of interests that will fail to serve the best interest of business, the consumer and the\nU.S. economy.\nIn our efforts to fix the oversight process for our financial system, we should not\n\nmisdiagnose the patient. Unfortunately, I’m afraid we are witnessing some regulatory\nmalpractice now. The emphasis on reform at this moment is to change the structure of the\n\nregulatory system rather than address the fundamental weakness of that system. Leading to this\n\ncrisis were a series of steps that eliminated or compromised financial standards that had saved to\n\n\f5\n\nsupport sound financial practices for generations. For the most pari, these titles were simple in\n\nform, understandable and enforceable. They served to constrain excessive leverage and\n\nundisciplined growth using simple leverage ratios, and they focused on fundamental\nunderwriting standards such as limits on loan-to-value. Accordingly, I am convinced that before\n\nwe spend time and energy restructuring the regulatory system, we should first determine which\ntitles of conduct should be reintroduced and enforced to provide for better outcomes. Perhaps in\n\nthe end there will be consensus to change our oversight structure, but I suspect reestablishing and\nthen enforcing rules that have proven effective over time will do more than the make-work\n\nexercise of regulatory restructuring. After all, England has one regulator and has fared no better\n\nin the current financial crisis.\n\nIn discussing any aspect of financial reform, one of the most significant changes that\nmust be accomplished is the end of “Too Big To Fail.” If nothing else, this current financial\n\ncrisis has confirmed its existence. Capitalism is a process of success, failure and renewal, and\nfor it to work properly, institutions must be allowed to fail, no matter their size or political\ninfluence. Institutions that are considered too big to fail have an implied subsidy. Research\nsuggests that these films are thought to have a lower cost of funds and a competitive advantage\n\nover their less “systemically important” competitors. Too big to fail introduces a “moral\nhazard” problem for society where creditors of these firms lessen their due-diligence programs\n\nknowing that they will be bailed out by the government should the institutions fail. The effect is\n\nto lower the costs to these films and significantly raise costs to the taxpayer and, ultimately, to\nfundamentally weaken our financial system.\n\nFinally, ending too big to fail is not the same as endorsing a disorderly liquidation\nprocess for institutions. Rather it demands a market-oriented solution to poor performance. It\nrequires a resolution process that holds management and investors accountable for their actions\n\n\f6\n\nand, properly structured, it provides for an orderly transition to new ownership or the closing of\n\nthe institution with the least disruption to the market and economy. I have previously outlined\nvarious examples of how this might be done based on what has worked in our financial history\n\nand in other countries. It is imperative that we learn from these examples. If we do not address\nthis issue, we will certainly invite a repeat of the recent financial turmoil and its devastating\n\neffect on our economy.\n\nImbalances and economic stability\n\nOver the past two decades, the U.S. has created for itseIf a set of economic imbalances\nthat, in my judgment, have significantly increased uncertainty and placed economic growth at\n\nrisk for future generations of Americans. That is a serious statement to make, so let me set out a\n\nfew facts to illustrate my point. As a nation, the U.S. has been living beyond its means for many\nyears. The U.S. current account balance since 1990 has declined steadily from approximately in\nbalance to a deficit of 6.5 percent of our GDP in 2005, and it remains at nearly 4 percent of GDP\n\ntoday. At its peak, this equates to almost $900 billion that the U.S. has borrowed from the rest of\nthe world on an annual basis. If this were being used to finance productive investment, I would\nnot be overly concerned because the returns we earn could finance the cost of borrowing.\n\nUnfortunately, however, a large share of U.S. imports is for consumption.\nThe reality of this imbalance is brought further into focus when we realize that U.S.\n\nconsumption as a percent of GDP has increased from an already relatively high 66 percent in\n1990 to 70 percent in 2006 and remains near this level even today. Just as significant is the fact\n\nthat U.S. aggregate personal savings had fallen from an already low rate of 5 percent of GDP in\n1990 to near zero in 2006. More significant still is the fact that for the same period, consumer\ndebt to income increased from a high of 84 percent to nearly 135 percent.\n\n\f7\n\nFinally, our federal government has, except for a short period at the end of the ’90s, run\n\nits own chronic annual deficit, which is projected to approach $2 trillion this fiscal year and will\nremain large for years to come. Moreover, these projections do not include the effects of\n\nadditional trillions of dollars of unfunded promises we have made to ourselves to provide Social\nSecurity and Medicare benefits for decades to come.\n\nBecause the U.S. economy is so large and, by historical standards, so successfill, it has\nthe capacity to cany such imbalances far longer than most economies would be permitted in\n\ntoday’s global markets. However, such an advantage will eventually end and comes with its own\ncosts. Over time, an ever-increasing amount of national and personal debt will raise the cost of\ncapital. As these costs increase, investment will slow and cause lower productivity, yet an\n\nimproving level of productivity is what is required to maintain a high standard of living. The\ndecrease in economic growth will most likely come slowly and be modest, but its compounding\neffects over future generations will be significant. For example, over a 25-year period, a 25-\n\nbasis-point reduction in real GDP growth would imply a difference of nearly 6 percent in the\nlevel of GDP, all else equal, as we economists like to say. In other words, seemingly small\npercentages can have an enormous impact on future generations.\n\nThe inflation challenge\n\nIt is one thing to outline the challenges we face, it is quite another to address them. To\nillustrate this point, I would direct you to an article by Martin Barnes, the managing editor of\nThe Bank Credit Analyst, published this May. In estimating the effect on consumption growth if\nthe annual savings rate steadily increased from zero toward 8 percent between now and the end\n\nof 2013, the article suggests that consumer spending would grow at an average rate of only 1.3\npercent per year. This would be a significant reduction of consumption growth, the slowest since\n\n\f8\n\nthe 1930s. There can be little doubt that such a growth rate would have a significant adjustment\n\neffect, even if only temporary, not only on the U.S., but also on the rest of the world. For the\n\nU.S., it most likely would imply the need to shift resources toward the export sector, and for our\nhading partners, it would mean relying less on sales to the U.S.\n\nStarting from where we are today, it is clear that interest rates must rise. As the economy\nrecovers, even at a modest pace, resource demands will begin to increase. At this point, the\ncurrent level of monetary accommodation will need to be withdrawn to avoid introducing\ninflationary impulses. Also, with the almost certain adjustments that need to occur in\nconsumption, savings and the rebalancing of imports and exports, I expect there would be\n\nadditional pressure for interest rates to rise steadily over time. To the extent that these\nadjustments will require considerable time to complete, unemployment levels, for example, may\n\ndecline more slowly than anyone wants.\nIf such a set of events occurs, then I also suspect there will be considerable pressure on\nthe central bank to “help out” in easing this adjustment process by keeping interest rates low for\n\nan extended period. This happens because people often confuse the establishment of low interest\nrates - and therefore the creation of money - with the creation of wealth. Sadly, through history,\n\nit has been shown repeatedly that excessive reliance on monetary policy as a means to avoid\nfundamental economic policy choices leads to high inflation and an actual worsening of an\n\neconomy’s long-term performance. I hope the U.S. can avoid the temptation to take policy short\ncuts as we emerge from this recession. We face difficult adjustments that must yet be made. The\n\nprocess will not be free of pain.\n\n\f9\n\nThe Federal Reserve System over the past nearly two years has more than doubled its\nbalance sheet as it has provided liquidity and monetary stimulus to the U.S. and world economy.\n\nIn doing so, it has saved to staunch the financial and economic panic. But it now must turn to\nthe matter of carefully removing this stimulus at the very time that consumers, businesses and the\n\ngovernment will need to fund pent-up demand for goods and services and to meet committed\nobligations. There is little doubt that such a “coincidence” of needs will place upward pressure\n\non interest rates. Central banks will have little choice but to allow these increases to occur or\nrisk the consequence of higher inflation, perhaps significantly higher. As I said, this process of\nremoving past monetary accommodation will be resisted. However, in contemplating this\n\nprocess and the pain of adjustment, I often emphasize that inflation is the least fair, most\nregressive and most corrosive tax we can impose on ourselves. It is particularly harsh for low- to\n\nmoderate-income citizens.\n\nFinally, the markets won’t be fooled by artificially low rates for long. Market\nparticipants realize that a period of high deficits and accommodative monetary policy are an\n\ninvitation to increased inflationary pressure. I suspect we are experiencing the first signs of the\nmarkets’ concerns in the rising rates and increased volatility in longer-term Treasury markets. I\n\nsuggest strongly that we need to be alert to the markets’ message and begin in earnest to bring\nmonetary policy into better balance before inflation forces our hand.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we emerge from this global financial crisis and recession, the United States must\naddress a series of significant financial and economic imbalances and risks. In dealing with\nthese challenges, the Federal Reserve must stay focused on our mission and make the tough - if\n\n\f10\n\nunpopular - decisions that will help guide our economy into better condition. A central bank’s\nmission remains that of holding the trust of the public by providing a stable currency that retains\n\nits purchasing power over time. It is for governments and businesses to allocate resources that\naddress our economic challenges. These are not things that a central bank should address\n\ndirectly. No matter how well-intentioned, to attempt to do so goes beyond its mission and risks\ndelaying and worsening the inevitable adjustment.\n\n\f"

            "content": "The Future of Retail Banking and Payments—Developments in Global Markets\nThe Role of Central Banks\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nECB/De Nederlandsche Bank Conference,\nFrankfurt,\nMay 25,2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or\nrepresentatives.\n\n\f2\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be here today and participate in this conference on retail\nbanking and the role of central banks. It is a pleasure for me to join you and provide my\n\nperspective on the U.S. retail payments system.\nDiscussion regarding this topic could not be more timely. Retail payments in the United\nStates and worldwide have undergone an enormous transformation over the past decade driven\nby technology and, just as importantly, notable changes in consumer preference. We get a sense\n\nof this change from a recent Federal Reserve study indicating that electronic payments now\nexceed two-thirds of all noncash payments in the United States. The efficiency, convenience,\n\nspeed and ease of use have fueled this transformation and will continue to do so for some time to\ncome.\nConsistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate to ensure the integrity and efficiency of\nthe payments system, we were a strong advocate of the migration of payments to electronic\n\nmechanisms. Though the electronic nature of retail payments has affected the Federal Reserve’s\ntraditional role, the Federal Reserve’s mandate has not changed. Although some question\n\nwhether the Federal Reserve can or should play an important role hr retail payments over the\n\nlong term, a strong case can be made for expanding the Federal Reserve’s role in electronic\npayments if it is to fillfill its mandate.\n\nToday I will discuss my own view that the Federal Reserve should not be contemplating\nan exit from retail payments. Coupled with the rise in electronic payments products, a dramatic\nchange hi the structure of the payments industry has introduced new challenges to assuring the\n\ncompetitiveness and safety of this system. The industry’s structure has been heavily influenced\nby economies of scale, which has brought with it an increased level of concentration in debit and\n\ncredit markets. For example, in 2007, the three largest PIN debit networks handled more than 81\n\n\f3\n\npercent of all transaction volume. Comparatively, in 1995, the three largest networks controlled\n\nonly 46 percent of the market. More striking, perhaps, is the fact that over the same period, the\nnumber of networks chopped from 43 to 14. Similar trends are evident in signature debit and\n\ncredit card issuance. And, of course, in the United States, three networks have long dominated\ncredit card clearing. To me, these developments raise important concerns about the\n\ncompetitiveness of card payments systems.\nThere are also reasons to be concerned about the integrity of this system. Growing levels\n\nof concentr ation and an increasing complexity of systems have invited greater vulnerability to\ndisruption and an enhanced potential for “single points of failure.” The increasing complexity\n\nhas raised the opportunity for fraud. There also has been a growth in the prominence of\nnonbanks, introducing new risks to the system.\nIn light of these developments. I believe that the Federal Reserve needs to continue\n\nplaying a strong role hr retail payments. Before looking more closely at what role the Federal\n\nReserve could play in the future, it may be useful to consider the economic rationale for central\nbank involvement hr retail payments more generally. This ratiorrale revolves around the\n\nexistence of externalities that potentially undermine the efficiency and integrity of payments\n\nsystems.\nPayments products and services require a critical mass of participants on two sides of a\nmarket. For example, a sigmfrcant number of merchants must be willing to accept a specific\n\nform of payment before consumers will use it. Conversely, a substantial number of consumers\nmust use that form of payment before merchants will consider installing atry necessary\n\nequipment or software. In this situation, a rrew product or network might not develop because, at\nthe individual level where such choices are made, neither consumers nor businesses have an\n\n\f4\n\nincentive to use the product. Both sides, however, might benefit if such a product was in place.\nSuch externalities, in which individual benefits or costs do not coincide with those accruing to\n\nsociety, can justify a public sector role in providing the service.\nSimilarly, there are possible externalities related to coordmation. Situations arise in\n\npayments markets where coordination among participants benefits both participants and users —\n\nfor example, adoption of uniform standards or a conunon technology. But agreements around\ncommon standards or technology are difficult to achieve because participants vary in size and\n\npreferences. In addition there can be a “free-rider” problem, where those that stay outside the\nprocess avoid cost associated with any agreement that might be made. The result is an\nunderprovision of services or products. One especially important example is the potential\n\n“underinvestment” in payments security by the private sector, for example, the continued use of\n\nmagnetic ship authentication for credit cards rather than more secure smart card authentication.\n\nThese externalities help explain the Federal Reserve’s traditional role in retail payments,\nespecially its role as operator in check processing and ACH. Its early check processing\ninvolvement was largely a response to the fragmented nature of the industry as payments carried\nacross literally thousands of commercial banks dispersed across a wide geographic area. Non­\n\npar- clearing was the norm, and remote locations were inadequately served. Under such\ncircumstances, it took only a few years for the Federal Reserve System to be involved in roughly\n\n50 percent of the value cleared through clearinghouses. By entering the market and ultimately\nbecoming a prominent participant, the Fed was, in effect, addressing coordination difficulties and\n\nnetwork effects. Similarly, it was instrumental in the 1950s and 1960s itr working with industry\nparticipants to establish the MICR standard and to develop high-speed sorting equipment.\n\n\f5\n\nWith regard to ACH, in the 1970s, the Federal Reserve assumed a leadership role in\npromo ting this technology to provide an alternative for bank-to-bank small dollar payments.\n\nPrivate sector banks, facing high startup costs and low ACH volumes, were understandably\n\nreluctant to invest in a new network. Without bank participation, there would not be consumer\n\ninvolvement. The Fed’s participation helped address this externality. It became one of the key\n\nACH operators, and for a few years following implementation of the Monetary Control Act, it\nsubsidized the ACH network. Over time, a critical mass was achieved, and today the ACH is one\n\nof the nation’s most heavily used retail payments systems.\nIn light of the trend toward greater industry concentration and the existence of important\n\npayments system externalities, the Federal Reserve should play a larger and more active role hi\n\nelectronic retail payments if it wants to promote the efficiency and integrity of the payments\nsystem. The key question is how this role should be defined. While the Federal Reserve could\n\nfocus more on regulation and oversight to achieve its mandate as many other central banks are\ndoing, I suggest that it should leverage its experience and position as an operator to achieve its\n\nobjectives.\nHistorically, the Federal Reserve’s role in both checks and ACH reflects a preference to\n\noperate within the market rather than as a pure regulator. We are well aware that industries can -\n\nand do - quickly develop methods to exploit any regulatory loopholes and avoid the intended\noutcome. By competing with the private sector on a level playing field, the Federal Reserve can\nencourage efficiency and integrity from an “on the ground” position.\n\nLooking forward, I also suggest that it could do so in the realm of electronic payments\nmore broadly. The Federal Reserve’s operational role will likely revolve around its ACH\n\n\f6\n\nplatform. Currently, the Federal Reserve is filling an important role in an ACH industry where\nthe Electronics Payments Network (EPN) is the only other active operator, and where the\n\nelimination of either party leaves a highly concentrated and less competitive market. While a\n\nrecent joint processing venture announced by Bank of America and Wells Fargo may spur the\nentry of a third ACH operator, economies of scale make entry difficult, especially in these times\n\nwhere capital is scarce and expensive. Without the Fed, it seems unlikely that a more competitive\nenvironment would emerge.\nACH volume has been steadily increasing in recent years with significant growth in\n\nnontraditional payments, such as Internet transactions and the conversion of paper checks to\nelectronic debits. Moreover, the volume and nature of ACH transactions have evolved to the\npoint where the ACH network is clearly of systemwide importance so that a major disruption\n\ncould have significant effects on the payments system and the broader economy.\nThus, in my view, the Federal Reserve’s future role in retail payments should be built\n\naround its current position in ACH. For example, in its operator role, the Federal Reserve could\n\naugment its ACH products and services, with the aim of enhancing competition and safety within\nthe ACH industry. An example where this is occurring is with same-day ACH settlement, which\nthe Federal Reserve recently announced it will begin to offer in the second quarter of 2010. This\nwill provide originating and receiving banks the option to accelerate the clearing and settlement\n\nof certain ACH debit payments, which will provide an earlier opportunity to identify return items\n\nand reduce risk.\n\n\f7\n\nThe Federal Reserve could also work with EPN to provide reciprocal backup services\n\nwith each other as well as with other electronic payments networks, and thereby serve as a\n“switch of last resort.” Such a role would prove invaluable in the event of serious disruptions to\n\nmajor networks, however unlikely such disruptions might be.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve could enhance competition hr payment card markets by\npositioning ACH services as an alternative to debit card payment networks. I am not suggesting\nthe Federal Reserve would issue its own cards or operate its own card network. However, the\n\nFederal Reserve could add enhancements to its ACH network, enabling it to become an\n\nalternative to running transactions over card networks. The recent development of so-called\ndecoupled debit cards provides an example of the industry making use of the ACH network in\n\nthis way.\nIn summary, as the payments system continues to evolve, the Federal Reserve’s role will\n\nneed to change. In my view, it would not be desirable for the Federal Reserve to scale back its\npresence in retail payments or even exit retail payments as some might advocate. Rather, the\n\nexistence of important externalities and increasing industry concentration suggest that the\nFederal Reserve must stay involved in retail payments. The question, then, is what form this\ninvolvement should take. Many central banks in a similar situation will likely opt to rely on a\n\nregulatory and oversight role. However, in part because of its unique history as an operator, I\n\nbelieve the Federal Reserve is well-positioned to leverage its traditional operator role to better\nenhance the integrity and efficiency of the payments system.\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nNew York, NY\nMay 4, 2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers, or\nrepresentatives.\n\n\fI am pleased to be here today to offer my perspectives on the ongoing financial turmoil.\nIn recent weeks, I have raised concerns about the policy response regarding institutions\nconsidered “too big to fail.” When events began to unfold in August 2007, U.S. policymakers\nreacted quickly to provide liquidity to markets and institutions. And, as matters deteriorated,\nthere was a further escalation of policy interventions to an extent not seen since the 1930s. Some\ninstitutions have failed, others have received sizable infusions of taxpayer funds to support their\noperations, and the functioning of some key financial markets now depends heavily on\ngovernment support. Despite these actions and some recent signs of improvement, markets\nremain under stress and the near-term outlook for the financial system and the economy remains\nuncertain.\nClearly, the magnitude, nature and scope of this financial crisis have posed significant\nchallenges for policymakers here and abroad. The weakening economy has caused financial\ndifficulties to escalate. But, in my view, the rush to respond has had negative consequences as\nwell. Without a systematic plan for addressing the crisis, policy actions have been ad hoc,\nresulting in inequitable outcomes among firms, creditors and investors that have increased\nuncertainty and undermined confidence. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the treatment of\nlarge, complex financial institutions that have been labeled as “systemically important” and “too\nbig to fail.”\nToday, I would like to place my recent discussion of the resolution of these large problem\ninstitutions in a somewhat broader context by taking a closer look at how we got into this\ndifficulty and by discussing some of the longer-run consequences of the actions being taken to\nresolve the crisis.\n\n2\n\n\fContext for the Crisis\nMany factors contributed to the financial excesses that spawned this crisis. But, at the\nroot of our problems is a collective failure of market discipline and public policy. Over the past\nthree decades, we have seen enormous growth in financial markets and institutions around the\nworld. This growth has been spurred by technological advances and financial innovation. But, it\nwas also supported by a philosophy that financial institutions and supervisors have the tools to\nmeasure and control risk while policymakers maintained an environment of stable prices and low\ninterest rates. This philosophy, moreover, led many financial institutions and investors to take\non more leverage, hold less in liquid funds, and downplay the risks of many of the new financial\ninstruments and counterparty relationships. Also, the removal of certain barriers to geographic\nand activity expansion in banking provided an additional incentive that helped pave the way for\never larger financial institutions, whose failure could have broad repercussions across the\nfinancial system and the economy.\nThis new system of finance relies more heavily on market discipline to manage risks and\nmaintain stability. But, as we have seen, there have also been factors that have served to\nundermine market discipline. These include: the increased complexity of financial instruments;\ninstitutional features that distorted incentives to take, measure and manage risks; and,\nimportantly, the view that large complex financial institutions would not be allowed to fail. I\nthink it is also fair to say that all regulators were complacent in performing their oversight\nresponsibilities in an environment of strong economic growth, low inflation and strong financial\nperformance.\nThese financial developments were supported by a very favorable macroeconomic\nenvironment, where a decline in inflation worldwide allowed central banks to maintain low\n\n3\n\n\finterest rates and ample credit availability, making debt and leverage more attractive. With these\nfavorable financial and macroeconomic developments extending over a long period of time -punctuated only occasionally by financial crises in some emerging market economies -- it is not\ntoo surprising that policymakers ignored the naysayers who warned of weaknesses in this system\nand did not develop a systematic plan for dealing with a major financial crisis such as the one we\nare currently confronting.\nCrisis Resolution\nFrom this introduction, let me now turn to my view on the resolution of large, complex\nfinancial institutions. While you may be familiar with some of my more recent remarks on the\n“too big to fail” issue, I have been concerned with this problem for some time. Previously, I\nsaid, “In a world dominated by mega financial institutions, governments could be reluctant to\nclose those that become troubled for fear of systemic effects on the financial system. To the\nextent these institutions become too big to fail, and where uninsured depositors and other\ncreditors are protected by implicit government guarantees, the consequences can be quite serious.\nIndeed, the result may be a less stable and a less efficient financial system.” I also noted that\n“recent history throughout the world suggests that “too big to fail” may be the policy of choice in\ncrisis situations, particularly when mega institutions play a large role in a country’s economy and\nfinancial markets.” I made these comments not this year, but in March 1999.1\nIn recent weeks, I have outlined a resolution framework for how we deal with the large,\nsystemically important institutions at the center of this crisis in the United States. Boiled down\nto its simplest elements, the plan would require those firms seeking government assistance to put\nthe taxpayer senior to all shareholders with the impact on managers and directors depending on\n\n1\n\n“Financial Industry Megamergers and Policy Challenges,” March 25, 1999.\nAvailable at: www.kansascityfed.org/home/subwebnav.cfm?level=3&theID=9983&SubWeb=6\n\n4\n\n\fthe viability of the firm. Nonviable institutions would be allowed to fail and be placed into a\nnegotiated conservatorship or a bridge institution, with the bad assets liquidated while the\nremainder of the firm is operated under new management and reprivatized as soon as feasible.\nThis plan is similar to what was done in Sweden in the 1990s and what we did in the United\nStates with the failure of Continental Illinois in the 1980s.\nThis plan has many advantages, including that management and shareholders bear the\ncosts for their actions before taxpayer funds are committed. This process also is equitable across\nall firms; is similar to what we now do with smaller banks; and provides a definitive process for\nreducing market uncertainty. These all are important reasons we must implement this kind of\nresolution process.\nIn contrast to this suggested approach, a policy of “too big to fail” raises important issues.\nFor example, it worsens the already significant problem of moral hazard in which investors do\nnot monitor risk appropriately, assuming, correctly it would seem, that the government will bail\nthem out of financial problems. Capitalism is a process of failure and renewal, and a policy that\nundermines this process makes the financial system and our economy less efficient.\nAlso, when firms are treated as “too big to fail,” they receive an implied subsidy and a\ncompetitive advantage over other firms.\nCritics of the approach I suggest have raised three main objections. First, they argue that\nthese institutions are too large and complex, with many international linkages, to be resolved in a\ntimely manner. I agree that these resolutions would be complex. But, historical experience also\nshows that forbearance is often more costly, especially to the taxpayer, than resolving the\ninstitutions in a timely manner. Second, critics suggest the failure of one of these institutions\ncould be very disruptive and worsen the crisis, citing Lehman as an example. I am not at all\n\n5\n\n\fadvocating the approach taken with Lehman. Rather, I am arguing for a timely, managed and\norderly resolution of large, insolvent institutions, with their basic functions continuing under new\nmanagement. Third, critics suggest that government resolution of these institutions amount to\ntheir “nationalization.” I believe this is a misnomer, as we are taking a temporary step that is\naimed at cleaning up a limited number of failed institutions and returning to private ownership as\nsoon as possible. This is something banking agencies have done many times before with smaller\ninstitutions and, in selected cases, with very large institutions. In many ways it is also similar to\nwhat is done during a corporate bankruptcy, but with an emphasis on ensuring continuity of\nservices.\nLonger-term Consequences\nIn the heat of a financial crisis, policymakers are in a reactive mode, especially in the\nabsence of a systematic plan to address the crisis. In this environment, it is tempting to\ndownplay the longer-term consequences of short-term decisions. But there are some significant\nimplications of the policy actions taken in this crisis that will shape the financial system and the\neconomic environment in the future. Let me conclude my remarks today with a discussion of\nsome of the longer-run consequences of the policy response to this crisis.\nOne key issue, of course, is what financial regulatory structure we want going forward if\nwe are to prevent a repeat of the current crisis on an even larger scale. While much of the\ndiscussion about regulatory reform will focus on who should be the regulator of what institution\nor activity, I believe there are two more important issues that need to be addressed. First, what\nshould be the span of regulation and the federal safety net; that is, which institutions or segments\nof the market should be covered by government guarantees and other support mechanisms?\nAlso, how should these entities be regulated to limit safety net exposure? A second key issue is\n\n6\n\n\fhow should we deal with large, systemically important financial institutions on a more\npermanent basis? In this regard, I fear that if we pour in enough public funds to see us through\nthe current crisis, we will then breathe a sigh of relief and back off from implementing any\ncomprehensive solutions to controlling the use of government guarantees and to addressing the\nproblems posed by systemically important institutions.\nIn my view, this would be a serious mistake. While a carefully constructed safety net and\na better resolution procedure for large institutions are critical, we also need to think about how to\nprevent such institutions from holding us hostage in the future. This may require breaking them\nup, limiting their activities or size, increasing capital requirements, or taking other steps to limit\nthe systemic risks they impose on the financial system.\nMore broadly, however, during this crisis we have seen an enormous extension of\ngovernment guarantees and support to institutions and markets that had not previously been\ncovered. Going forward, we must credibly convince financial markets and institutions that such\ncoverage will not be easily forthcoming in the future. A key step in accomplishing this is to take\nthe steps that I have suggested to resolve large problem institutions. If we fail to do so, we will\nsee moral hazard problems escalate far beyond their current levels, with enormous adverse\nimplications for the efficiency and stability of our financial system.\nThis crisis will also have an enormous fiscal cost that will place a large future burden on\ntaxpayers, even as we come closer to the tsunami of looming Social Security and Medicare\nobligations. Going forward, we need to ensure that managers, shareholders and creditors of\nfinancial institutions bear the full costs of their risk-taking, and I think we need to make it harder\nfor policymakers to pass these costs on to taxpayers.\n\n7\n\n\fFinally, let me comment on some of the longer-run implications of the Federal Reserve’s\nrole in the policy response to this crisis. This crisis has involved segments of the financial\nsystem that operate outside of the traditional federal safety net, which has been limited to\ndepository institutions. In fact, many of the players in this crisis would not be given access to the\ndiscount window during normal circumstances and have been subject to little in the way of\nprudential supervision. The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis in providing liquidity and\nsupport to institutions and markets outside of its traditional purview has been significant, creative\nand timely.\nHowever, in stepping outside its normal sphere of operations and making decisions about\nwhich markets and institutions to support, the Federal Reserve has also moved into creditallocation decisions which are more properly performed by the marketplace itself and by fiscal\nauthorities when necessary. These decisions have also caused the Federal Reserve to greatly\nexpand its balance sheet and have almost certainly set expectation for similar responses in any\nfuture crises. All of this will make it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to quickly remove its\npolicy accommodation in the future and, thereby, will subject it to new tests of its independence\nas a monetary authority.\nConcluding Comments\nWe have expended considerable resources addressing this difficult crisis, but still, we\nhave a ways to go before markets will function effectively without government assistance. In my\nview, this process will go faster and with less ultimate cost if we take decisive steps to resolve\ninsolvent institutions in a timely manner, regardless of their size and complexity. Over the\nlonger term, we face the difficult task of redesigning our system of financial regulation to\nprovide more stability, while maintaining innovation and efficiency. This is always a difficult\n\n8\n\n\fbalance to strike, but it will be nearly impossible if we do not address the problems posed by\nlarge, complex financial institutions.\n\n9\n\n\f"

            "content": "For release on delivery\n9:30 a.in. EDT\nApril 21, 2009\n\nStatement of\nThomas M. Hoenig\n\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nbefore the\nJoint Economic Committee\n\nUnited States Congress\n\nApril 21, 2009\n\n\fMadam Chair Maloney, Vice Chair Schumer, ranking members Brady and Brownback,\n\nand members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you about the issues\nsurrounding the exceptionally large financial institutions whose failure may pose systemic\nthreats to the financial system.\n\nThe United States currently faces economic turmoil related directly to a loss of\n\nconfidence in these large institutions. Although the response to the events of the past year has\ntaken on various forms, so far, we have not seen the return of confidence and transparency to\nfinancial markets, leaving lenders and investors wary of making new commitments. Until that\nfaith is restored, it is impossible for us to achieve full economic recovery.\nWhen the crisis began to unfold last year, and its full depth was not yet clear, we were\nquick to pump substantial liquidity into the system. In the world we find today, with the crisis\ncontinuing and hundreds of thousands of Americans losing their jobs every month, it remains\n\ntempting to pour additional hinds into these institutions in hopes of a turnaround. We have taken\nthese steps instead of defining a consistent plan or addressing the core issue of how to deal with\nthese institutions that now block our path to recovery. Our actions so far risk prolonging the\n\ncrisis while increasing the cost and raising serious questions about how we eventually unwind\nthese programs without creating another financial crisis as bad or worse than the one we\n\ncurrently face.\nThese large and systemically important institutions are regularly referred to as “too big to\nfail,” but yet we all know that a free market system requires that insolvent firms, regardless of\n\ntheir size, market position or the complexity of their operations, must fail. We have been\n\nunwilling to allow this to happen to these firms, ignoring that we have an existing mechanism\n\n1\n\n\fthat can be used for Finns of all sizes and allows for their dissolution while controlling damage to\nthe broader financial system.\nThere seems to be a prevalent line of thinking that the problems we now face with these\n\ninstitutions are simply too complex for us to resolve without widespread damage to the financial\nsystem. I don’t think those who managed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the\n\nResolution Trust Corporation or the Swedish financial crisis were provided with a blueprint that\nguaranteed then success. And though I would be the first to acknowledge that the path I propose\n\nis not easy. I do not accept the idea that we have lost our ability to solve the challenges we now\n\nface.\nTills system has a proven hack record in the United States as well as abroad and it would\n\nserve us well in the current crisis. I have included hi this written testimony the text of a speech I\ndelivered recently in Tulsa, Okla., that spells out the details of how this program would work.\n\nAdditionally, I have included supplementary information including further details related to the\n\nresolution framework for large institutions; the process used to handle the 1984 failure; of\nContinental Illinois, which was one of our nation’s largest financial institutions at the time of its\nfailure, and the approach Sweden took hi response to that nation’s banking crisis in the 1990s,\n\nwhich is very similar in many ways to what we face in the United States today.\nIn addition to the current turmoil, from a regulatory perspective we must also make the\nchanges necessary to protect the financial system from a similar crisis in the future. For some\n\ntime, there has been an ongoing debate in the regulatory community pitting proponents of a\nbroad principles-based approach against those favoring a more rigid rules-based system that can\nbe widely understood and more readily, and evenly, enforced. The current crisis has made the\n\ncase that the rules system is our only alternative, as the principles-based approach leaves far too\n\n2\n\n\fmuch open for the discretion of the firms in question and not enough authority for the various\n\nregulatory agencies.\nAlong these same lines, this crisis has been the first real test of the Basel II capital\n\nframework, and it has failed miserably. Basel II relies on firms making their own detailed\n\nassessments of the risks they have assumed so a capital requirement can be assigned. I would\n\ndoubt any of us today would believe such a system to be desirable or even workable.\nEnforcement under Basel II relies on examiners understanding and evaluating extremely\n\ncomplex mathematical models. When it becomes clear that these models understate capital\n\nneeds, examiners often have difficulty arguing the technical merits of their views and convincing\nbank management to add capital. In many ways, Basel II provides banks with a rationale, a\n\ndefense and an opportunity for taking excessive leverage. Banks have strong competitive and\nfinancial incentives to increase leverage. Dining good times, leverage increases profitability, but\n\nit also increases risk. We have seen the broad systemic effects of excessive leverage. To limit\nsuch problems in the future, we must maintain limits on financial leverage through strict rules\nsetting minimum capital-to-asset ratios. It would be the easiest, most equitable and clear-cut way\n\nto set capital requirements for all sizes of banks and for a broader range of films throughout\n\nfinancial markets.\nOne of the more troubling aspects of this crisis has been that in many ways these events\n\nhave not been unpredictable. A decade ago. I and others anticipated that the financial\nmegamergers we were seeing at that time would lead to a situation like the one we face today.\n\nAlthough we did not have any way of knowing the events that would provide the\nstimulus for this crisis, there were already concerns in 1999 that, “In a world dominated by mega\n\nfinancial institutions, governments could be reluctant to close those that become troubled for fear\n\n3\n\n\fof systemic effects on the financial system. To the extent these institutions become ‘too big to\n\nfail,’ and where uninsured depositors and other creditors are protected by implicit government\nguarantees, the consequences can be quite serious. Indeed, the result may be a less stable and a\n\nless efficient financial system.”1\nTins is clearly the result we now face, and it is even more pressing that we deal with the\nproblem at hand in a manner that brings stability and transparency back into our system for the\n\ncurrent environment or it is a certainty that this is an environment in which we will find\n\nourselves yet again.\n\n1 “Financial Industry Megamergers and Policy Challenges,” speech by Thomas M. Hoenig, delivered March 25,\n1999. Accessible at www.KansasCityFed.org /hoine/subwebnav.cfin?level=3&theID=9983&SubWeb=6.\n\n4\n\n\fSUCCESS DEPENDS ON FAILURE\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nTulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nApril 9, 2009\n\n5\n\n\fAs you all know, we are in the middle of a very serious financial crisis, and our economy\nis under significant stress. There has been much debate about how we should address these\nchallenges, but regardless of the method one supports, all agree that the economy will not\n\nrecover until the financial system is stabilized and credit flows improve.\nThe restoration of normal financial market activity depends on how we deal with the\n\nproblems of our largest financial institutions. It is has been a little more than a year since the first\n\nmajor government rescue occurred with Bear Steams being acquired by JPMorgan. Since then,\nnumerous programs have been enacted and trillions of dollars of public funds have been\ncommitted, much of it directly to our largest institutions. Despite these well-intentioned efforts,\n\nthe problems remain, and the public’s dissatisfaction with how their money is being spent grows.\n\nIt is not surprising that the initial measines taken in tins crisis were ad hoc. The depth and\nextent of the problems were not anticipated. However, more than a year has passed and the\nchallenge that still remains is to define a plan that addresses the significant asset problems\n\nembedded hi our largest institutions. We must provide financial firms, investors and consumers\n\nwith a clear and fair plan for dealing with firms that many call “too big to fail.”\nLast month, I gave a speech that outlined a resolution framework and a plan for how we\n\nshould deal with these large systemically important financial firms. I believe that failure is an\n\noption. Those who disagree with my resolution proposal say that it is unworkable. In my remarks\n\ntoday, I will offer more details about how the process would work and explain why I think it is\nthe best solution for getting our financial system and economy on the road to recovery.\n\n6\n\n\fPrinciples for a Resolution Framework\n\nFor a free market system to be successfill, firms must be allowed to fail based upon a\n\npredefined set of rales and principles that market participants can rely on when determining their\nstrategies and making decisions. This is particularly important for problem financial institutions.\nThese key principles should apply if we are talking about a small bank in Tulsa or a large\n\ninternational financial conglomerate in New York City.\nThe first principle is to properly understand our goals and correctly identify the problems\n\nwe are attempting to solve. This may sound obvious. However, when we are in the middle of a\ncrisis where more than a half million people are losing their jobs every month, it is tempting to\npour money into the institutions thinking that it will correct the problem and get credit flowing\n\nonce again. Also, rather than letting the market system objectively discipline the firms through\n\nfailure and stockholder loss, we tend to micromanage the institutions and punish those within\nreach.\n\nTins lack of confidence in the market’s remedy is most acute for our largest financial\ninstitutions, which have publically disclosed substantial losses. The question that the supervisory\n\nauthorities must answer is whether the losses are large enough to threaten the solvency of any of\nthese firms. This assessment is the first step in determining actions necessary to restoring public\n\nconfidence in our financial system.\nA second principle is that we must do what is best for the overall economy and not what\nis best for one group. We need to make sure that when one financial firm fails, the resolution\nprocess does not cause significant disruptions to financial markets and the economy or make the\n\n7\n\n\fcurrent problems worse. Furthermore, we must do it for the lowest possible cost so that we don't\ncreate a long-tenn fiscal burden on taxpayers.\n\nIt is important to recognize that there are not just the direct costs but, more importantly,\nlong-tenn costs to the economy and financial system. The direct cost of resolving a failed bank,\n\nsuch as the government bearing some of a failed bank’s losses, is simple to determine. However,\n\nit is much more difficult to know the costs from some of the unintended consequences. For\nexample, market discipline is reduced when a resolution process does not make management,\n\nshareholders and creditors bear the costs of their actions.\nThe third principle is equity of treatment. Regardless of an institution’s size, complexity\nor location, the resolution process must provide consistent treatment of a failing institution’s\n\nowners, managers, employees and customers. The process must be transparent and clearly stated\nso that everyone understands what to expect if they gamble with the film’s assets.\n\nWhen talking about equity of treatment, it is important to recognize that a single process\n\ncan lead to different outcomes. For example, if any bank is examined and found to be insolvent,\n\nit needs to go through the resolution process with the owners losing their investment. However,\nthe eventual outcomes for the institution can be different. A smaller bank’s assets and deposits\n\nwill likely be sold to another bank. In the case of a larger bank, the firm might be temporarily\n\noperated as a bridge bank before either being sold or reprivatized. Regardless, it is important that\nthe banks go through the same process or else an incentive will be created for banks to take on\nexcessive risks in an effort to grow large enough to gain favorable treatment.\n\nA final principle is that we must base the resolution process on facts about what works\nand what does not work. One way to do this is to look at past financial crises. Ulis is not the first\n\n8\n\n\ffinancial crisis, and we can learn a lot about what will and will not be successful by looking back\n\nat our own history with financial crises, as well as at the experiences in other countries.\n\nIdentifying the Problem\n\nWith these principles in mind, how should we go about resolving the current problems at\nour largest institutions?\n\nFirst, we must determine both the location and size of the losses. Admittedly, it will not\nbe easy. These firms are very large - the four largest bank holding companies each have more\nthan $1 hillion of assets, which accounts for about half of the banking industry’s assets. They\n\nhave offices around the world, and they are involved in many complex businesses. But in order\n\nto repair the financial system, we must get the best estimates of the condition and viability of\nthese firms, and we must require them to reflect their losses in their financial statements.\n\nNormally, we think of a business’ solvency in terms of the value of its equity capital.\nWhen the value of its assets is less than the value of its liabilities, it has negative equity and it\n\nhas failed. A financial firm, however, can also fail if its liquidity is insufficient to meet its current\npayment obligations, either because it can’t sell its assets for enough to pay off maturing\n\nliabilities, or it loses market confidence and cannot borrow enough.\n\nI would note that these are concrete definitions and not subjective conditions. I mention\nthis because it points out that the tenn “too big to fail” is a misstatement. It does not matter what\n\nsize the firm is. Although a bank might still be open and operating, if it is insolvent by these\ndefinitions, it has failed.\n\n9\n\n\fOnce we determine a bank's status, we would classify these institutions into three\ncategories, depending on whether they are solvent and what their prospects are for continuing as\n\nan ongoing concern.\nThe first category would be firms whose operations are strong and whose equity remains\n\nabove minimum requirements. These firms would not require much government support, if any.\n\nSome might need to raise additional capital to provide a greater cushion against the losses they\nmay suffer during the current crisis. But these institutions are basically sound and should be able\nto raise private capital.\n\nThe second categoiy would be those institutions whose equity temporarily falls below\nminimum requirements but are expected to recover in a reasonable period of time as economic\n\nconditions improve. These films have generally sound management, who may have made some\nmistakes and suffered greater losses than normal due to the economic downturn. It is reasonable\n\nto expect these banks to raise additional private capital. However, the government may need to\nprovide some capital in the form of preferred shares and possibly some warrants in return. As an\n\nequity holder, the government would have an oversight role regarding the films’ operations and\n\nactivities.\nThe final categoiy is for the institutions that are no longer viable either because of\nliquidity problems or their equity capital is currently negative or it is likely to become negative,\n\nbased on reasonable expectations of future market and economic conditions. These firms, which\nwould likely soon become equity insolvent without government protections and guarantees,\n\nwould be declared insolvent by the regulatory authority. Shareholders would be forced to bear\nthe full cost of the positions they have taken and risk losing their investment. Senior management\n\nand the board of directors would be replaced because they are responsible for the failed strategy.\n\n10\n\n\fA Resolution Process\nThe question then becomes how to resolve these failed institutions while minimizing the\ncost and disruption to the economy.\n\nThe method most often used when a bank fails is to arrange for a sale of its assets and an\nassumption of its liabilities by another institution. For these extremely large firms, there are a\ncouple of significant roadblocks preventing this solution. First, the acquiring firm must have the\n\ncapacity for the acquisition, which means it would have to be in the same size range as the failed\ninstitution. And secondly, if such a deal was forged, it would create an even larger firm with\n\ngreater systemic risks to the economy.\nInstead, an extremely large firm that has failed would have to be temporarily operated as\na conservatorship or a bridge organization and then reprivatized as quickly as is economically\nfeasible. We cannot simply add more capital without a change in the film's ownership and\n\nmanagement and expect different outcomes in the future.\nExperience shows that this approach has worked. The best example was with the failure\n\nof Continental Illinois National Bank and its holding company in 1984. Because we are in\nOklahoma today, I will note that Continental's problems began with some bad loans it purchased\n\nfrom Oklahoma City’s Perm Square Bank. As an officer in our Bank's regulatory function at that\n\ntime, I was directly involved in the closing of Penn Square. In fact, from 1982 to 1992, 347\nbanks failed or received FDIC assistance hi the Tenth Federal Reserve District states. I was\n\ninvolved in almost every one of these resolutions and all were tragedies. I tell you this to make\nclear that I do not take this proposal lightly nor do I expect any size bank failure to be easy or\n\n11\n\n\fpainless. But the process that worked for Continental Illinois is a viable approach to addressing\nimportant aspects of today’s crisis.\nAt the time of its failure, Continental Illinois had $40 billion in assets and was the\n\nnation’s largest commercial and industrial lender. It was the seventh- largest bank in the United\nStates. It had 57 offices in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a large network of domestic and\n\ninternational correspondent relationships, and a separate function for making residential and\ncommercial real estate loans. It also provided specialized services to a variety of companies.\n\nWhen Continental failed, its top management and directors were replaced with\n\nindividuals who had experience operating large, complex organizations. John Swearingen,\nformer chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding company, and William\nOgden, a former vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, became CEO.\nThe FDIC committed to taking a book value of $4.5 billion of bad assets off of\n\nContinental’s balance sheet and placed them hr a separate work-out unit to recover as much of\nthe value of the assets as possible. Among those bad assets, $1 billion was written off as a loss at\nthe time of the transaction.\nTo offset the $1 billion loss to Continental’s capital, the FDIC provided $1 billion in\n\ncapital in exchange for preferred stock, of which $720 million was convertible to common stock\n\nupon sale. When converted, the $720 million would amount to a 79.9 percent ownership stake in\nContinental.\nThe FDIC also received five-year warrants to purchase the remaining common stock for\n\nfar below one cent per share ($0.00001). If at the end of five years, the cost of the resolution was\nmore than $800 million, the FDIC would exercise 100 percent of the warrants; if losses were\n\nlower, the amount of warrants exercised would be in proportion to the amount of the losses.\n\n12\n\n\fTo economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation unit\n\nwas staffed by a combination of FDIC personnel, hired specialists and Continental employees\nunder incentive contracts.\n\nContinental Illinois was fully reprivatized by 1991 and eventually purchased by Bank of\nAmerica in 1994. The FDIC exercised all of the wanants so the shareholders in Continental's\nholding company effectively lost their entire investment. The FDIC sold all of the preferred\nshares and shares from exercising the wanants for $1.2 billion, which was a net gain of $200\n\nmillion. The FDIC also earned $200 million in dividends. The ultimate resolution cost to the\nFDIC was $1.1 billion, which was 3.28 percent of Continental's assets at the time of resolution.\nThere has been much talk lately about a new resolution process for systemically\nimportant firms that Congress could enact, and I would encourage this be implemented as\n\nquickly as possible, but we do not have to wait for new authority. We can act immediately, using\nessentially the same steps we used for Continental.\n\nStock could be issued and control assumed by a government entity. A bridge institution\ncould be created within the institution so essential sendees and operations would continue as\nnormal. Where necessary, the government would provide capital in exchange for preferred shares\n\nconvertible to common stock upon sale. Existing shareholders would provide the government\nwanants to purchase all outstanding shares with the amount exercised determined by the\ngovernment’s resolution cost. Senior management and directors would be replaced.\nThe most difficult part of resolving these large firms without a new resolution process is\n\nhow to make creditors bear the cost of their positions. Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing\nobligations would be addressed and dealt with according to the covenants and contractual\n\npriorities set up for each type of debt. Insured creditors would have immediate access to their\n\n13\n\n\ffunds, while other creditors would have immediate access to maturing funds with the potential\nfor haircuts, depending on expected recoveries, any collateral protection and likely market\n\nimpact. However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors,\nunless there’s a process that allows regulatory authorities to declare a nonbank financial firm\ninsolvent.\n\nRegardless of how the firm is resolved, short-term liabilities in particular would need to\nbe addressed immediately because of their importance in meeting the creditors’ daily payment\nobligations and operational needs. Quick decisions should also be made on all counterparty\n\narrangements because of the widespread impact that uncertainty would have on the\ncounterparties.\nAuthorities would also need to assess the market impact - specifically, whether the losses\n\nassociated with this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in financial markets and serious\n\nfunding problems that would threaten the viability of other financial firms. If so, it may be\nnecessaiy to honor all counterparty arrangements and/or short-term liabilities, as we did with\n\nContinental Illinois.\nHowever, this guarantee must be considered as an exception to the normal process.\nCongress would have to enact an approval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as\n\nspecified in the 1991 FDIC Improvement Act, requiring approval by two-thirds of the Federal\nReserve Board, two-thirds of the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Treasury, in consultation\n\nwith the president.\n\nAs much as I dislike extending government guarantees and thereby reducing market\ndiscipline, if we were to implement this exception, I believe we would also need to extend the\n\n14\n\n\fsame guarantees to all other institutions or we would give failed institutions a competitive\n\nadvantage.\n\nAnother key part of the resolution is that the bad assets need to be taken off the balance\nsheet of the failed institution at realistic market values and placed in an asset management\n\ncompany, resulting hi two entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”\n\nAlternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the receiver could take the bad assets and work them out.\nAfter writing off the bad assets, the government would provide the “good bank” with enough\n\ncapital so that it can become a profitable ongoing concern and attractive to private investors for\n\nreprivatization. Any recoveries horn the bad bank would first go toward paying off the costs of\nthe government, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of\nremaining claimants.\n\nThe separation of the bad assets is critical. When a bank has a large share of\nnonperforming assets, they remain a burden when they are left on the balance sheet, even if they\n\nare written down appropriately. For example, they must be funded although they are not\n\nproducing income. Such a circumstance creates uncertainty about the bank’s financial condition\n\nand diverts management's attention from the business objectives necessary for recovery. The\nfocus of the “good bank” must be on the future, gaining new customers and expanding\n\noperations, while the goal of the “bad bank” must be on getting rid of customers and winding\n\ndown the operations.\n\nAs part of the reprivatization process, it is also important to determine the advisability of\nbreaking up or selling off operations and independent subsidiaries where possible, especially\n\ngiven the market discipline problems we have encountered with institutions regarded as “too big\n\nto fail.” Moreover, assessing the condition and viability of large, complex financial firms is\n\n15\n\n\fdifficult, and the failure of such a firm may be an indication that it is also too large and complex\n\nto manage well. We should avoid setting conditions that only repeat past mistakes in creating too\nbig and too complex an institution.\n\nThis system is clearly more equitable than what we have seen so far.\nAt the start of the TARP I program. $125 billion was provided to the nine largest\n\nfinancial firms without an in-depth, thorough exam of their condition. However, all other banks\nreceived TARP funds only if their primary regulator concluded they were strong enough to\n\nweather the crisis and continue as an ongoing concern.\nThe $10 per share that Bear Steams' stockholders received from the JPMorgan Chase\nacquisition would not have been possible without the government’ s guarantee of $29 billion of\n\nproblem assets. Additionally, the government has committed $173 billion to support AIG’s\ncontinued operations, with their shareholders standing to reap financial gain if AIG ultimately\n\nrecovers.\nMeanwhile. 46 banks in the United States have failed since the beginning of 2008. All of\n\nthem were resolved through one of the bank resolution problems I have discussed here today.\n\nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work?\n\nIt is understandable that there are concerns about letting these large firms fail, but it\nshould be noted that the program I have just described has a record of success elsewhere.\nThe economic situation in Sweden hi the early 1990s was similar to that in the United\nStates today. Its financial system was dominated by six large banks that accounted for 90\npercent of the industry’s assets. Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major\n\nfinancial institutions. The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through\n\n16\n\n\fprivate sources, and public authorities quickly took over two large insolvent banks and spun off\n\ntheir bad assets to be managed within a separate entity. Sweden was able to systematically\nrestore confidence in its financial system, and although it took several years to work down and\nsell off all of the bad assets, there was minimal net cost to the taxpayers.\n\nSome argue that the Swedish situation is not a valid comparison because it only dealt\nwith only six banks, hi addition, some argue that the Swedish system was much less complex,\nand that the Swedish government had to work out primarily commercial real estate loans instead\nof the complex financial assets, structured securities and derivatives that we would have to work\nout today.\n\nThese are valid concerns, but I would point out, first, that although the United States has\nseveral thousand banks, only 19 have more than $100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory\n\nauthorities evaluate their condition, it is likely that few would require further government\nintervention. Second, as for complexity, I would point out that real estate assets involve\n\nconsiderable complexity, no less so than many financial derivatives.\n\nAnother import ant example is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which was\nused to deal with banking problems in the United States in the 1930s. The RFC followed a\n\nprocess very similar to what I have described. It began by examining problem banks and writing\ndown the bad assets to realistic economic values, making any needed and appropriate changes in\nbank management, injecting public equity as needed into these banks, and returning the banks to\nprivate ownership. The RFC proved to be highly successfill in recapitalizing banks, and like\n\nSweden, there was essentially no net cost to taxpayers. More detailed information on both the\n\nContinental Illinois and Swedish models for large bank resolution will be posted today with a\ntext of my remarks on our Bank’s website at KansasCityFed.org. Absent a detailed explanation\n\n17\n\n\fof why this approach can’t be done, it is my hope that it will be usefill to provide more details\naround my view that it can be done.\n\nLet me make two final points.\n\nFirst, the debate over the resolution of the largest financial firms is often sensationalized\nbecause it is framed in terms of nationalizing failed institutions. It is also pointed out that\n\ngovernment officials may not be effective managers of private business concerns.\nIn response, I would note that no firm would be nationalized in this program.\nNationalization is the process of the government taking over a going concern with the intent of\n\noperating it. Though a bridge institution is the most likely outcome when a large financial firm\nfails, the goal is for the firm to be reprivatized as quickly as possible, hi addition, subject to\n\nregulatory agency oversight, the bridge film would be managed by private sector managers\nselected for their experience in operating well-run, large, complex organizations.\n\nThe second point is related to the complexity issue, which is that it would be hard to find\n\nenough people with the required knowledge, experience and skills to fill the open positions.\nGoing back to the Continental Illinois example, we were able to do it then. More generally: The\n\nUnited States is a vast country with a tremendous amount of management resources in a broad­\nbased economic and industrial system. If the United States does not have the talent to run these\nTurns, then we are much worse off than I thought. I refuse to accept that conclusion.\n\n18\n\n\fMATERIALS REFERENCED IN THE SPEECH:\n\nSUCCESS DEPENDS ON FAILURE\n\n•\n\nA Resolution Process for Financial Filins\n\n•\n\nAssistance for Continental Illinois\n\n•\n\nSwedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis\n\n•\n\nReferences\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nTulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nApril 9, 2009\n\n19\n\n\fA Resolution Process for Financial Firms\n\n•\n\nThe United States is hi the middle of a serious financial crisis, and the economy is under\nsignificant stress. While there has been a lot of debate about how to revive the economy and\nrestore financial stability, there is broad agreement that the economy will not recover until\nthe financial system is stabilized and credit starts flowing more normally.\n\n•\n\nThe recovery of the financial system depends critically on the public regaining trust and\nconfidence hr financial institutions, particularly the largest financial institutions. The public’s\nconfidence in the largest institutions has been seriously shaken by the risks they have taken,\nthe poor management of those risks and the resulting losses. Thus, the restoration of normal\nfinancial market activity depends importantly on how the problems of the largest bank and\nnonbank financial institutions are addressed.\n\n•\n\nDespite the best of intentions, the policies and actions directed at restoring the health of the\nfinancial system have not been consistent or transparent. It is understandable that the initial\nmeasures were ad hoc and inconsistent because the depth and breadth of the problems were\nnot expected and there were no plans in place for addressing the problems.\n\n•\n\nThe solution must be a clear and fair plan so that financial firms, investors and consumers\nknow what to expect when any financial institution runs into problems. Specifically, the plan\nmust provide a process for how policymakers will address the deterioration of the financial\ncondition of all financial firms, regardless of their size, and resolve them if they become\ninsolvent.\n\n•\n\nA resolution process is particularly important for the largest, most complex and\ninterconnected institutions because they have been considered by many as “too big to fail,” at\nleast since the early 1980s. This paper describes a resolution process that can be used for any\nfinancial film involved in the intermediation process or payments system, but the focus is on\nthe large, systemically important institutions. The premise of the paper is that no firm is too\nbig to fail and that resolving a large failed firm is the best solution for the economy.\n\nPrinciples for a Resolution Framework\n\n•\n\nA free market system requires that busmess owners capture the profits from their successes\nand bear the costs of their failures. Finns that meet the market test will grow, while those that\ndo not will shrink and, ultimately, must be allowed to go out of business if they fail. The\nconsequences of failure and the resolution framework must be clearly stated and transparent\nso that business owners have clear expectations about the consequences of their actions.\n\n•\n\nThe resolution framework must prescribe a predefined set of rules, guided by an agreed upon\nset of principles. This is particularly important for financial institutions, big or small, because\ntheir success depends critically on the public’s trust that they are solvent and a viable,\nongoing concern.\n\n20\n\n\f•\n\nThere are two key principles that the resolution process should follow.\n\n•\n\nFirst, the resolution process should minimize the cost to the overall economy.\n- When resolving an insolvent firm, it is important that it does not cause significant\nfinancial and economic disruptions or exacerbate current problems.\n- The process should minimize the cost of resolving an insolvency to avoid a long-term\nfiscal burden on taxpayers.\n- The relevant costs are not just the direct costs but, more importantly, the current and\nfuture impact on the economy and financial system.\n- The direct costs of resolving a failed bank, such as the government bearing some of the\nfailed bank’s losses, is simple to add up.\n- However, minimizing the future costs on the economy and financial system, particularly\nthe unintended consequences, is much more difficult.\n- To minimize the future cost to the economy, the resolution process must not create\nadverse incentives that are inconsistent with economic efficiency. Specifically, the\nresolution process must not allow a film’s management, shareholders and creditors to\navoid the consequences of then mistakes because it reduces market discipline, creates\nadverse incentives for firms to take too much risk, and inefficiently directs resources and\nfinancial capital to less-productive uses.\n- The process must be transparent and clearly stated so that everyone understands what to\nexpect and the consequences of their actions. Management must know beforehand what\nwill happen if they gamble and take excessive risks that turn out to have a significant,\nnegative effect on the firm’s financial condition.\n- Finally, to minimize costs, the resolution process should be based on solid research and\ninformation about what works and what does not work. Policymakers can learn a lot\nabout what will and will not be successful by looking back at previous U.S. financial\ncrises, as well as at crises in other countries.\n\n•\n\nThe second principle is the resolution process must be equitable in that it is the same for all\nfinancial films regardless of size or location, although it is possible that the outcome will\ndiffer.\n- The resolution process must provide consistent treatment of a failing institution’s\nowners, managers, employees and customers, regardless of the institution’s size,\ncomplexity or location.\n- When talking about equity, it is important to recognize the difference between process\nand outcome.\n- For example, if a bank is examined and found to be insolvent, the bank should go through\nthe resolution process and the owners should lose their investment regardless of the\nbank’s size. The outcome may be that a relatively small bank is resolved by another\ninstitution purchasing its assets and assuming its deposits, while a relatively large bank is\ntemporarily operated as a bridge bank.\n- In both cases, the banks go through the same process of being declared insolvent and the\nsame procedures for determining how it will be resolved.\n- Otherwise, banks may take on excessive risks just to grow to a size large enough to\nreceive favorable treatment, and customers may choose to go with a large bank instead of\na small bank.\n21\n\n\fOptions for Resolving a Failed Financial Institution\n\n•\n\nThere are several options for resolving a failed film, but it is important to first define\ninsolvency.\n- By definition, a firm is insolvent if its common equity capital is negative - that is, the\nfilm’s outstanding liabilities owed to creditors is greater than the total value of its assets.\n- However, a financial firm, even if it has a positive amount of equity capital, is not viable\nand will fail if its liquidity is insufficient to meet its current payment obligations, either\nbecause it cannot sell its assets for enough to pay off maturing liabilities, or it loses\nmarket confidence and cannot borrow enough.\n- It is important to note that these are definitions of insolvency and are not subjective\nconditions, which points out that the teim “too big to fail” really is a misstatement. It\ndoes not matter what size a firm is - if it is insolvent by these definitions, it has failed.\n\n•\n\nThe question becomes, what do we do when a firm fails?\n\n•\n\nOne option is for the government to allow an insolvent firm to maintain ongoing operations\nby providing funds to bring capital ratios up to required minimums or to meet payment\nobligations.\n- In this case, no tiling is actually resolved, and the insolvent film is essentially bailed out\nso that it can continue normal operations.\n- This option may be used for a large financial film that is considered “too big to fail”\nbecause of concerns that it is systemically important, in the sense that other resolution\nmethods would have large, negative spillover effects on economy.\n- Under this option, the teim “too big to fail” should be restated as “too big to resolve”\nbecause of the near-term negative spillover effects and disruptions to the economy and\nfinancial system.\n- In a bailout, senior management and directors keep their jobs; current shareholders do not\nlose their investment, although the government may impose some restrictions on the\nfilm’s activities and practices; and creditors do not suffer any losses.\n- A bailout is the worst option in terms of the first principle of minimizing costs.\n- While a bailout may temporarily stabilize current economic conditions or not\nimmediately cause further problems, it sets the stage for significant future problems. In a\nbailout, senior management, directors and current shareholders stand to reap any gains\nthat may result, which weakens market discipline and creates the moral hazard that the\nfirm will take too much risk.\n- Bailouts are also inequitable because they are used only for the “too big to fail” firms and\nnot for smaller films that are not expected to cause spillover effects if other resolution\nmethods are used.\n\n•\n\nAlternatively, bank regulators have for years used a variety of options to resolve insolvent\nbanks. These options include:\n- liquidation,\n- arranging for the sale of a failed bank’s assets and assumption of its liabilities by another\ninstitution,\n\n22\n\n\f- or operating the bank for a short period of time through open-bank assistance or as a\nbridge bank or conservatorship until the bank can be sold to another bank or group of\nprivate investors.\n\n•\n\nWhen most people think of a firm as failing, they generally think the firm is shut down and\nliquidated.\n- In a bank liquidation, the FDIC is appointed as a receiver and it pays off insured\ndepositors up to the deposit insurance limit.\n- Uninsured depositors are generally paid partial amounts based on expected recoveries.\n- The FDIC maximizes the value of the assets by selling them or holding on to them and\nworking them out. The proceeds from the assets are used to first pay remaining amounts\nowed to uninsured depositors and other unsecured creditors, and if anything is left over,\nto shareholders.\n- Because the firm is insolvent, the uninsured creditors will suffer some losses, and they\nmay have to wait for a long time to receive their final payouts.\n- While liquidation strongly enforces market discipline and does not promote moral hazard,\nit tends to be the most disruptive option for resolving a big or small financial firm, and\ntherefore is the least desirable choice.\n- Tins option is disruptive for individuals and business customers because they tend to hold\nshort-term instruments, such as deposits and commercial paper, for making payments or\nas a temporary way of storing their funds. Many bus mess customers also have\ncounterparty arrangements, such as derivatives contracts, that would go into default when\nthe bank is liquidated.\n\n•\n\nThe resolution method used most often is a purchase and assumption (P&A) transaction,\nwhere the FDIC as receiver finds another bank to purchase the insolvent bank’s assets and\nassume its liabilities.\n- In terms of the direct costs to the government, this is typically the least-cost resolution\nmethod because the FDIC may receive a premium from the acquiring bank. And even if\nthe FDIC has to pay the acquiring bank to assume the liabilities, it is often less costly\nthan paying off insured depositors and having to manage and liquidate the failed bank’s\nassets.\n- More importantly, though, it generally has the least negative impact on the economy.\n- Short-term creditors and counterparties have immediate access to all insured deposits and\nat least a large portion of uninsur ed obligations, while borrowers continue to have access\nto credit.\n- In addition, because management and directors are replaced and shareholders lose their\ninvestment, a P&A transaction does not reduce market discipline or create adverse\nincentives for bank management and shareholders.\n\n•\n\nWhile a P&A transaction is often the best option for most failed banks, it generally is not the\nbest option if one of the largest financial institutions fails because it creates even larger\ncompanies that pose even greater systemic risks to the economy.\n- A major difficulty in the current financial crisis has been that some institutions are so\nlarge and complex that resolving them when they fail is complicated and disruptive no\nmatter what option is used.\n\n23\n\n\f- Only another institution in the same size range would have the capacity and resources to\npinchase the assets and assume the liabilities of another large institution.\n- Indeed, over the past year, there have been several examples of large institutions taking\nover other large, problem institutions. It only makes sense that if institutions can get “too\nbig to fail,” then all else held constant, the resolution process should not result in even\nlarger institutions.\n\n•\n\nThe final option, which is the most feasible for a large, complex financial institution that\nfails, is to run it temporarily as a conservatorship or bridge organization.\n- Clearly, a liquidation would be too disruptive to the economy.\n- Tins option also provides time for potential acquirers of the institution or its parts to\nconduct the necessary due diligence.\n- The institution would then reprivatized as soon as it is economically feasible.\n- As will be discussed below, management, shareholders and creditors would be forced to\nbear the frill cost of their actions and positions they have taken to maintain market\ndiscipline and economic efficiency.\n\n•\n\nOne of the difficulties with all of these options is that while there are time-tested, fast\nresolution processes in place for depository institutions, today’s largest financial institutions\nare conglomerate financial holding companies with many financial subsidiaries that are not\nbanks.\n- The bank subsidiaries could be placed into FDIC receivership, but the only other option\nunder current law for the holding company and other subsidiaries is a bankruptcy process.\n- Bankruptcy proceedings can take a long time to complete - sometimes years - which\nworks well for a nonfinancial firm because it can continue normal operations while in\nbankruptcy.\n- It does not work for financial firms, however, because they have a variety of complex,\nshort-term liabilities and counterparty arrangements that customers depend on for\nmaintaining daily operations. A long, drawn-out bankruptcy proceeding would prevent\ncustomers and counterparties from having access to then funds, which would cause\nsignificant economic disruptions.\n- In addition, the cornerstone of a financial institution’s franchise value is trust in its\nviability as an ongoing concern, and that trust is sine to quickly erode in a long, drawnout bankruptcy proceeding.\n- The difficulty in resolving failed holding companies quickly and in a way that minimizes\nthe disruption to the economy is why the Treasury secretary recently proposed a\nresolution process for systemically important financial holding companies.\n\n•\n\nEnacting a resolution process for financial companies is clearly important, but the\nsupervisory authorities do not need to wait for it to happen and should act immediately to\nresolve a large financial company should one fail.\n\n24\n\n\fA Proposed Resolution Process\n•\n\nHie resolution process discussed below is applicable to any financial firm that is part of the\nintermediation process or payments system, but in light of the current financial crisis, the\nfocus is on systemically important financial institutions that are found to be insolvent.\n\n•\n\nTo prevent systemic disruptions to the economy, a failed institution should be allowed to\ncontinue its operations through a bridge institution or conservatorship so that all essential\nservices and operations would go on as normal.\n- Because the firm is insolvent, it would need additional capital to continue operating.\n- To recapitalize the firm, the government could provide the capital in exchange for\npreferred shares, convertible to common stock upon sale.\n\n•\n\nhi general, the supervisory authorities would not have the authority to declare the institution\ninsolvent. Thus, to ensure that management and shareholders bear the costs of their actions\nand investment decisions, the government’s investment would be conditional on:\n- Replacement of the senior management and board of directors that led the firm to failure.\n- Existing shareholders providing the government warrants to purchase all outstanding\nshares, with the amount exercised determined by the net costs of resolving the firm.\n- While share holders may be reluctant to agree to these conditions, in most cases, they\nwould have little choice given the immediate need for liquidity and capital assistance.\n\n•\n\nThe specific steps to be taken would depend on several factors, such as the type of financial\norganization and the supervisor’s existing legal authority.\n■ For example, if a holding company’s primary asset is an insured bank and the bank and\nholding company become insolvent, the bank could be closed and the FDIC could set up\na bridge bank.\n■ In this case, the holding company would also fail, and the supervisory authorities could\ntake actions to mitigate the impact on the rest of the economy.\n\n•\n\nThe most difficult part of resolving these large firms without a new resolution process is how\nto make creditors bear the cost of their positions.\n- Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing obligations would be addressed and dealt with\naccording to the covenants and contractual priorities set up for each type of debt.\n- Insured creditors would have immediate access to their funds, while other creditors would\nhave immediate access to maturing funds with the potential for haircuts, depending on\nexpected recoveries, any collateral protection and likely market impact.\n- However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors,\nunless there's a process that allows regulatory authorities to declare a nonbank financial\nfirm insolvent.\n\n•\n\nRegardless of how the film is resolved, it is critical to make quick decisions on how creditors\nwill be treated.\n- Short-term liabilities in particular would need to be addressed immediately because of\ntheir importance in meeting the creditors’ daily payment obligations and operations\nneeds.\n\n25\n\n\f- Quick decisions also need to be made on all counterparty arrangements because of the\nwidespread impact that uncertainty about their status or default would have on their\ncounterparties.\n- So that unsecured creditors bear the cost of their decisions and market discipline is\nmaintained, the resolution authorities should consider leaving these creditors standing in\nline behind more senior creditors as the claims on the bank are resolved.\n- However, the authorities would also need to assess the market impact - specifically,\nwhether the losses associated with this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in\nfinancial markets and serious funding problems that would threaten the viability of other\nfinancial firms.\n\n•\n\nhi a severe financial crisis, such as is occurring today, it may be necessary to honor short­\nterm liabilities and/or all counterparty arrangements to prevent a systemic disruption to the\neconomy.\n- However, this guarantee should be considered as a “systemic” exception to the normal\nprocess.\n- To limit the use of this exception to truly systemic situations, Congress should enact an\napproval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as specified in the 1991\nFDIC Improvement Act.\n- This exception requires approval by two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board, two-thirds\nof the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the president.\n- In addition, though the extension of government guarantees and the resulting reduction in\nmarket discipline should generally be avoided, extension of the same guarantees would\nneed to be made to every other institution. Otherwise, failed institutions would have a\ncompetitive advantage over sound institutions, which clearly violates the principle of\nequitable treatment.\n\n•\n\nAnother key part of the resolution is the bad assets need to be taken off the balance sheet of\nthe failed institution at realistic market values.\n- One option is to place the bad assets in a separate asset management company, resulting\nin two new entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”\n- Alternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the receiver could take the bad assets and work\nthem out.\n- After writing off the bad assets, the government would provide the good bank with\nenough capital so that it can become a profitable ongoing concern and attractive to\nprivate investors for eventual reprivatization.\n- Any recoveries from the bad bank would first go toward paying off the costs of tire\ngovernment, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of\nremaining claimants.\n\n•\n\nThe separation of the bad assets is critical for creating a forward-looking process for recovery\nand the eventual reprivatization of the good bank.\n- When a bank has a large share of nonperfonning assets, they remain a burden when they\nare left on the balance sheet, even if they are written down appropriately.\n- For example, they still have to be funded even though they are not producing income,\nthey create uncertainty about the bank’s financial condition, and they divert a lot of\n26\n\n\fmanagement’s attention from more productive activities for the future growth and\nprofitability of the bank.\n- In addition, the business objectives and the skills necessary for managing bad assets and\nrecovering their maximum value is very different from the objectives and necessary skills\nfor running an ongoing financial firm.\n- In other words, the goal of the good bank is to attract new customers and expand\noperations, while the goal of the bad bank is to get rid of customers and wind down the\noperations.\n\n•\n\nAs part of the reprivatization process, the supervisory authorities should consider breaking up\nor selling off operations and independent subsidiaries where possible.\n- The growth of firms into “too big to fail” institutions has created significant market\ndiscipline problems.\n- In addition, if such a firm were to fail, it may also be an indication that it is too large and\ncomplex to manage well.\n\nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work?\n•\n\nA variety of concerns has been raised about letting the largest financial firms fail. These\nconcerns are legitimate and it is clear that any solution will be difficult and costly. However,\nthe resolution process being advocated here has a record of success elsewhere.\n\n•\n\nFirst, the proposed resolution process is exactly what the Swedes did to solve an equally\nsevere banking crisis that they had hi the early 1990s (see attachment “Swedish Response to\n1990s Banking Crisis” for a more detailed description of the Swedish crisis and resolution\nprocess).\n■ The economic situation in Sweden was similar to today’s, and their financial system was\ndominated by six large banks that accounted for 90 percent of the industry’s assets.\n■ Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major financial institutions.\n■ The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through private sources, and\npublic authorities quickly took over two large insolvent banks and spun off then- bad\nassets to be managed within a separate entity.\n■ Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its financial system, and although it took\nseveral years to work down and sell off all of the bad assets, there was essentially no net\ncost to the taxpayers.\n■ Creditors, however, were fully protected because the supervisory authorities were\nconcerned about the systemic consequences of imposing losses on uninsured depositors\nand other unsecured creditors.\n\n•\n\nSome people do not think that the Swedish situation is a valid comparison because it dealt\nwith only six banks. In addition, some argue that the Swedish system was much less\ncomplex, and that the government primarily had to work out commercial real estate loans,\nnot the complex financial assets, such as structured securities and derivatives, that would\nhave to be worked out today if a large financial institution was allowed to fail. While these\nconcerns are valid, it should be noted that:\n\n27\n\n\f- Although the United States has several thousand banks, only 19 banks have more than\n$100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory authorities evaluate their condition, it is\nlikely that only a few would have to be resolved.\n- It is actually very difficult to work out problems on real estate assets, and it is not\nnecessarily more difficult to work out even complex securities.\n\n•\n\nAs an aside, an additional lesson that can be learned from Sweden is that a resolution process\nis much more likely to succeed if it has broad political support and is structured to be\nindependent of the political process.\no The plan should be put largely under the control of in dependent supervisory agencies.\no Political involvement should be confined largely to specifying the program’s goals and\nbasic rules.\no The Swedes also found that a commitment to providing the supervisory authority the\nfunds necessary for resolutions reduces the need for political involvement.\n\n•\n\nA second example is this is essentially the process the Reconstruction Finance Corporation\n(RFC) used to deal with banking problems in the United States in the 1930s.\n- The RFC began by examining problem banks and writing down the bad assets to realistic\neconomic values.\n- It then made any needed and appropriate changes in bank management and provided\npublic equity capital as needed.\n- Finally, it returned the banks to private ownership and essentially recovered all of its\ncosts.\n\n•\n\nA final example is the failure of Continental Illinois National Bank and its holding company\nin 1984. This is a good comparison because it is an example of a holding company resolution\nusing preferred stock and warrants as described in the proposed process, hi addition, it is an\nexample of a resolution of a large, complex, interconnected holding company.\n- Continental Illinois was the largest U.S. commercial and industrial lender and the\nseventh- largest U.S. bank. It had 57 offices in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a\nnetwork of 2,300 domestic and international correspondent relationships, and a separate\nfunction for making residential and commercial real estate loans. It also provided\nspecialized services to a variety of companies.\n- The attached document, “Assistance for Continental Illinois,” provides details about the\nprocess used to resolve the bank and holding company.\n- The result was that the bank and holding company management were replaced, the\nholding company shareholders lost their entire investment, and the bank was restored to\nsound condition and returned to private ownership.\n- As in Sweden, Continental Illinois’ creditors were fully protected because of concerns\nabout the systemic consequences of imposing losses on uninsured depositors and other\nunsecured creditors.\n\nAnother concern that has been raised about letting the largest financial films fail is that it\nnationalizes these institutions. As part of this concern, it is also often pointed out that\ngovernment officials may not be effective managers of private business concerns.\n■ In the proposed process, no firm would be nationalized.\n\n28\n\n\f■\n■\n\n■\n\n•\n\nNationalization is the process of the government taking over a going concern with the\nintent of continued ownership.\nThough a bridge institution is the most likely outcome for a large financial firm that fails,\nthe goal is for the firm to be reprivatized as quickly as possible, subject to the\ngovernment not wasting taxpayer funds.\nIn addition, subject to regulatory agency oversight, the bridge firm would be managed by\nprivate sector managers selected for their experience in operating well-run, large,\ncomplex organizations.\n\nSome opponents to the proposed process also claim it would be very difficult to take over\nthese firms and bring in new management because they are too complex to manage, as well\nas there is not enough people with the required knowledge, experience, and skills to fill the\nopen positions.\no The Continental Illinois example shows it is possible bring in a management team with\nexperience running large, complex organizations.\no In addition, while the institution might be complex, a new management team is clearly\nbetter than leaving the institution under the control of the management team that caused it\nto fail in the first place.\no More generally, it is hard to believe that there is not enough talent, either from the United\nStates or other countries, to run these organizations.\n\n29\n\n\fAssistance for Continental Illinois\nI.\n\nProblems at Continental Illinois\n\n•\n\n•\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nII.\n\nInterim Financial Assistance\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nIII.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Continental Illinois pursued a strategy of rapid\ngrowth in commercial lending, particularly energy lending, that was largely funded\nby purchased money.\nIt became the seventh-largest U.S. bank and largest commercial lender in the United\nStates.\nPeim Square’s failure in 1982, LDC debt problems and the downturns in energy\nmarkets led to declining asset quality and earnings at Continental from 1982 into\n1984 and forced Continental to rely heavily on foreign money markets for funding.\nNews stories in May 1984 on Continental’s problems started a run by foreign\ndepositors on Continental, and by May 19, they had withdrawn more than $6 billion.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago began lending through the discount window to\ncover the lost deposits, and Continental put together a $4.5 billion loan package\nfunded by 16 large U.S. banks, but these steps did not stop the deposit run.\n\nOn May 17, 1984, the FDIC, OCC and Federal Reserve announced an interim\nassistance package for Continental, which was based on the FDIC’s open bank\nassistance authority.\nThe FDIC explicitly guaranteed all deposits at Continental in order to keep a liquidity\ncrisis from spreading to other U.S. banks, prevent significant losses at tire many banks\nthat had correspondent accounts at Continental and avoid other negative effects in\nU.S. financial markets.\nA $2 billion capital infusion for Continental was arranged in the form of interest­\nbearing subordinated notes, with the FDIC providing $1.5 billion and the remaining\n$500 million provided by seven of the largest U.S. banks.\nThe Federal Reserve agreed to meet any liquidity needs of Continental, and a group\nof 24 major U.S. banks also agreed to provide more than $5.3 billion in funding on an\nunsecured basis until a permanent solution was developed.\nThe FDIC was unable to find any merger partners for Continental during this interim\nperiod, presumably due to Continental’s asset problems, substantial litigation and\nfunding issues, along with the limited number of merger partners under Illinois’\ninterstate banking restrictions.\n\nPermanent Financial Assistance\n\n- In July 1984, a permanent assistance plan was put in place for Continental.\n\n30\n\n\f- Continental’s top management and board of directors were removed. John\nSwearingen, former chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding\ncompany, and William Ogden, a former vice chairman of Chase Manilattan, became\nCEO of the bank.\n- The FDIC assumed $3.5 billion of Continental’s discount window borrowings from\nthe Federal Reserve.\n- In exchange for assuming this debt, the FDIC received $3.5 billion (adjusted book\nvalue) of assets from Continental. This consisted of poor quality loans that\nContinental had already written down to $3 billion (these loans were further written\ndown to $2 billion in this transaction, and Continental was forced to take a charge of\n$1 billion against capital) and a note from Continental for $1.5 billion, which\nContinental could repay within tlnee years by giving the FDIC additional loans of\nContinental’s choice with a book value of $1.5 billion.\n- To offset the $1 billion charge to Continental’s capital that was required by the loan\nsale, the FDIC infused $1 billion in capital into Continental. Tire FDIC’s capital\ninfusion consisted of $720 million of permanent, convertible, nonvoting, junior\nperpetual preferred stock in Continental’s holding company (this amounted to a 79.9\npercent ownership stake in Continental if converted) and another $280 million of\npermanent, adjustable-rate, cumulative preferred stock in the holding company. This\nassistance was provided through the holding company rather than the bank because\ncovenants in the holding company’s debt instruments required debtholder approval to\nsell the bank or to inject capital directly into it.\n- The FDIC also received an option designed to compensate it for any losses, carrying\ncosts or collection costs on the loans it acquired.\n- The $2 billion in subordinated notes issued Under the interim plan was repaid.\n- To economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation\ninvolved a combination of FDIC personnel, Continental employees under incentive\ncontracts and hired specialists.\n\nTV.\n\nReturn to Private Ownership and the Cost of Resolving Continental Illinois\n- In a series of sales that took place between December 1986 and June 1991, the FDIC\nsold all of its preferred stock and the stock acquired through its option.\n- The shareholders in Continental’s holding company lost their entire investment once\nthe FDIC exercised the option it received as compensation for loan liquidation losses.\n- From the sale of stock, which completed the return of Continental to private\nownership, the FDIC had a net gain of $200 million over its initial $1 billion capital\ninvestment, and it also received more than $200 million in dividends on tills stock.\n- Overall, the loss on the FDIC’s books from Continental’s failure was $1.1 billion,\nwhich is equal to 3.28 percent of Continental’s assets at the time of resolution.\n- Bank of America eventually bought Continental in August 1994.\n\n31\n\n\fSwedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis\n• Economic and financial market conditions leading up to the Swedish banking crisis were\nvery similar to the conditions leading up to the current crisis.\n- Deregulation of financial markets (elimination of quantitative controls on bank lending,\nceilings on interest rates and restrictions on capital flows) is similar to recent deregulation\n(Gramm-Leach- Bliley) and financial innovations (securitization, derivatives).\n- Large inflow of foreign capital and expansion of domestic lending and debt.\n- Low/negative real interest rates.\n- Strong growth in consumption and real estate investment and low savings rate.\n- Sharp increases in asset prices (stocks and real estate).\n• Although the economic downturn leading to the crisis was precipitated by rising real\ninterest rates, the impact on the economy was similar to the current crisis.\n- Stock and real estate prices fell sharply (tangible asset values fell about 30 percent).\n- Bankruptcies increased dramatically (bankruptcies grew about 20 percent, 40 percent and\n70 percent in 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively).\n- Consumption fell and the savings rate rose from being slightly negative at the end of the\n1980s to 8 percent in 1993.\n- Residential real estate hivestment froze.\n• Goal of financial support and recovery plan - temporary government investment in banks\nwhere necessary, but banks were to be placed in private ownership as soon as economically\nfeasible.\n• Political support - the program had broad political support, which was important for quick\ndecisive actions and providing the national leadership necessary for public support.\n• Political independence - a Bank Support Authority, separate from the financial supervisory\nauthority and central bank, was established under the Ministry of Finance to manage the\nprogram. The Bank Support Authority (BSA) had open-ended funding and was free from\npolitical interference in making decisions, although the BSA worked closely with the\nsupervisory authority and central bank.\n• Debt guarantees\n- All bank depositors, counterparties, and other creditors were frilly protected from future\nlosses, including foreign creditors (accounted for about 40 percent of bank funding).\n- Guarantees were eliminated when the crisis ended in the mid-1990s, and a bank-financed\ndeposit insurance system was created (Sweden did not have deposit insurance prior to the\ncrisis).\n• Transparency\n- The government was very open about the process.\n- A valuation board composed of real estate experts was used to ensure consistent and\nrealistic asset values, and asset values that had declined were promptly written down.\n• Bank recapitalization\n- A bank’s future viability was estimated using a quantitative model of profitability subject\nto various economic scenarios. Banks were placed in one of three categories based on their\nviability in the worst-case scenario, which determined the type of government support they\nwould receive.\n- Categoiy 1 - Capital deteriorates but remains above minimum requirements.\n32\n\n\f•\n\n•\n\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe bank was expected to raise additional capital, with temporary government guarantees\navailable if necessary to help maintain public confidence.\n- Category 2 - Capital falls below minimum requirements but is expected to rise above the\nminimum in a reasonable period of time.\nShareholders were expected to contribute additional capital, with the government\ncontributing capital as necessary to meet opera ting requirements. Government received\npreferred shares.\n- Category 3 - Capital becomes negative and bank is unlikely to become profitable.\nBank declared insolvent and government resolves the bank in the least-costly manner,\nincluding the possibility of liquidation.\nGood bank, bad bank model - used for banks that received government support and for\ninsolvent banks. Nonperforming loans were transferred to work-out companies at realistic\nmarket values. The good bank is provided additional capital as necessary for sound\noperations and managed by financial market professionals with clear business objectives.\nShareholders were not protected (except for one bank in which the government was the\nmajority shareholder, as noted below).\n- Government’s preferred shares were offset by a corresponding reduction in private shares.\n- The government also received voting power that would grow over time, so the government\nwould eventually become the majority shareholder if the support was large enough and\nmaintained for a long period of time.\nBanks that received assistance were given conditions to make operational improvements.\nGovernment representatives were placed on the bank boards to ensure compliance.\nResults\n- Among the six major banks, Nordbanken (Category 2) received government capital (the\ngovernment was already the majority shareholder and it also purchased the outstanding\nprivately held shares); Gota (Category 3) failed, was taken over by the government and\neventually merged with Nordbanken; and Sparbanken received a government loan.\n- The banking crisis was largely over by 1996 and the banking system remained largely\nintact - there were no runs and few signs of a credit crunch.\n- While there is no official estimate of the cost of the support program, the most recent\nestimate of the net fiscal cost is that the government broke even, which is based on\ngovernment outlays during the most acute phases of the crises and revenues from the sale\nof bad assets, preferred shares and other proceeds over the past 15 years. The initial gross\nfiscal cost of the support program is estimated to have been about 4 percent of GDP.\n- Ultimately, Nordbanken was largely privatized and is now part of Nordea (the government\nowns about 20 percent), which operates hi Sweden, Norway, Finland and Demnark.\nLessons learned\n- Political consensus on a support plan is crucial.\n- Once the plan is folined and implemented, it is just as important for the process to be\nindependent of political interference and fully transparent to the public.\n- The government officials hr charge of the program must take timely and decisive actions\nto resolve problem firms, which is one reason political independence is important.\n- Assets must be given realistic valuations.\n- Shareholders at failing banks must lose their investment, and senior management and the\nboard of directors must be replaced for both efficiency and equity purposes. Markets will\nnot be efficient unless those who may benefit from taking risk actions also bear the costs\n\n33\n\n\fwhen those actions lead to losses, and equitable treatment requires that the same Riles\napply to all firms regardless of size.\nThe program’s success also requires that the new management of the good and bad banks\nare financial industry professionals, are given sound business objectives and clearly\nunderstand to whom they are responsible, which is another reason why political\nindependence is important.\n\n34\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\nDavison, Lee. “Continental Illinois and ‘Too Big to Fail/” History of the Eighties, Lessons for\nthe Future, Vol. 1, An Examination of the Banking Crises of the 1980s and Early 1990s, Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, 1997, Chapter 7, pp. 235-257.\nEnglund, Peter. “The Swedish Banking Crisis: Roots and Consequences,” Oxford Review of\nEconomic Policy, Vol. 15, No. 3, pp. 80-97.\nErgungor, O.

Hoeing\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Community Affairs Research Conference\nWashington, DC\nApril 17,2009\n\n\fOn behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, along with our planning partners at\nthe Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and San Francisco, and the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors, I would like to welcome you to the second day of this conference and thank you for\n\nyour participation.\n\nAlthough the topics to be discussed here are always of extreme importance, the current\n\nenvironment gives our discussion added urgency. Though we are all being affected by the humoil\nin our economy, the underserved are especially vulnerable. Their safety net may be extremely\n\nlimited, if it exists at all. Meanwhile, they are often the fust to suffer during an economic\n\ndownturn and the last to recover.\n\nAs you all know, there are many reasons why it is important that consumers have access to\nfinancial products and the knowledge to use them safely. In addition to what it does for the\nindividual or family, it is also important for tire nation’s collective well-being that consumers at all\nlevels are able to make wise decisions with their finances in a manner that best suits their needs.\n\nWith this in mind, the regional Federal Reserve Banks have taken a number of steps\nfocused on these issues within the communities they serve. It is well-known that the 12 Reserve\nBanks, along with their branches, play an important role in giving the Federal Reserve a truly\nnational perspective on issues related to monetary policy and banking. But they also conduct\n\nimportant research to help the Federal Reserve and others understand the underlying issues for\nthose with low incomes and those who are underserved in the area of financial services, hi\nDecember of 2007, the Fed convened staff from its research, supervision and community affair s\nareas to identify the state of knowledge concerning mortgage markets in the current environment.\n\nThis effort identified knowledge gaps to be addressed through research and outlined strategies to\nhelp individuals and communities respond to the financial crisis.\n\n2\n\n\fWe have integrated the research with public programs where our regional Reserve Banks\nare taking on an increasingly prominent role. Where once our public programs were focused\n\nprimarily on providing information to broad groups of constituencies, we are now engaged largely\n\nin technical and capacity building efforts with defined stakeholders.\nTlu'oughout the System, each Bank has developed unique programs to meet the identified\n\nneeds within its District, and by doing so has strengthened the learning, innovation and\neffectiveness of the System’s overall response. This is one of the real strengths of our System.\n\nBecause the Reserve Banks are regional institutions, we are able to foster local partnerships and\noffer local expertise to the conununities of our respective Districts.\nAlthough these programs are created at the individual Bank level to serve a local need, in\n\nalmost all instances they provide a template that can be, and often is, replicated by the other\n\nBanks, expanding the reach and success rate of our best and most beneficial programs. These\n\nefforts allow us to be more nimble and proactive in responding to common problems.\nWith my remaining time I would like to highlight and recognize some of our more\n\ninnovative responses to tire financial crisis.\n\nForeclosure mitigation/housing\nUnderstandably, our programs related to foreclosures and foreclosure mitigation have\nexpanded significantly and are our primary focus. In 2008, the Conununity Affairs functions\nacross the System sponsored three times as many events related to foreclosure as a year earlier.\n\nWe have brought together diverse groups such as developers, realtors, lenders and servicers to\n\nfoster a common understanding and common approaches. We have made numerous presentations\nto public officials and policymakers at all levels.\nSeveral Federal Reserve Banks have worked with alliances, including HOPE NOW\n\nAlliance and NeighborWorks America, to present foreclosure prevention workshops that bring\n\n\ftogether borrowers, counselors and servicers to directly identify and address individual consumer\nproblems. Without a doubt, the most notable of these events was coordinated by the Boston Fed\n\nand held at Gillette Stadium, the home of the New England Patriots. That event, which involved\nnumerous partners including the Patriots’ charitable foundation, brought more than 2,000\n\nhomeowners facing foreclosure together with mortgage servicers. In Kansas City, where the\n\nimpact of the crisis has been slightly different, a similar event where organizers expected to help\n350 troubled borrowers ended up providing assistance to more than twice that number.\n\nAs we have seen a rise in foreclosure-related scams, the Fed has been active, working with\nNeighborWorks America on a public service campaign to raise awareness about the issue. We\nhave also created an innovative series of ads developed by the Board of Governors that will be\nshown in movie theaters, much like motion-picture trailers, in targeted communities where we are\n\nfinding the problem is prevalent.\nWe have established Web-based Foreclosure Resource Centers on each of the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks’ websites to help address local and regional challenges in mortgage markets and\n\nlocal communities. The Foreclosure Resource Centers are customized by each Bank, based on the\nregion-specific conditions. The Board's public site includes a map linking to each of the regional\n\nforeclosure centers. For homeowners and homebuyers, the centers provide contact information for\nagencies that can help those in financial trouble or provide counsel for those who want to buy their\nfirst home. For community leaders and local municipalities, the centers offer information on\n\npreserving and protecting the neighborhoods where foreclosures have occurred. The centers also\nprovide access to Federal Reseive research and notices of upcoming events.\n\nThe Fed has published dynamic maps showing conditions and density of owner-occupied\nsubprime mortgage loans at the state, county and zip code level. The maps are based on data for\n\nowner-occupied mortgage loans that have been securitized into a product that is categorized as\nsubprime, based on the grade assigned to the security. State- and comity-level maps and data with\n4\n\n\fTransUnion credit card and mortgage delinquency rates and changes have also been added to the\n\nsite. The interactive maps provide a national source for information on foreclosure incidence with\nthe ability to drill down further into conditions at the regional level.\n\nOur Community Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit assists community organizations and local\ngovernments in addressing the current tunnoil in the housing market and minimizing the impact of\nforeclosures on neighborhoods. The resources in the Community Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit\n\nare presented as a four-step process to: 1) assess the foreclosure situation; 2) reach troubled\n\nhomeowners; 3) establish post-foreclosure support systems; and 4) stabilize neighborhoods.\nCommunity Affairs offices worked to develop best practices for creating, packaging and\n\ndistributing foreclosure crisis toolkits for smaller municipalities.\n\nThe Federal Reserve convened the Recoveiy/Renewal/Rebuilding series of conferences\n\nand seminars throughout the summer and fall of 2008. Events hosted by the Federal Reserve\nBanks of Atlanta, San Francisco, Cleveland and St. Louis were designed both to investigate ways\n\nto address the negative spillover effects of foreclosures and to help the Federal Reseive gather\ninsights on the many complex factors around foreclosure issues. After the series, a “capstone”\nevent held at the Board of Governors explored a range of policy topics and focused on emerging\n\nthemes.\nThese forums provided greater focus on the impact of the foreclosure crisis on different\n\nreal estate markets; on strategies that address both the negative impact of foreclosures in high-cost\nmarkets and the challenge of strengthening neighborhoods in weak market communities; and on\n\nhow recent research on foreclosure and vacancy and abandonment might be actualized as public\npolicy. The series also clarified the challenges and the strategies for moving toward solutions.\n\n5\n\n\fOther efforts\n\nThe area of financial education has been a longtime area of emphasis for the Federal\n\nReserve. We know there is a connection between making wise financial choices and problems\n\nsuch as foreclosure and other quality-of-life issues including the ability to gain additional\neducation or retire.\nAt the Kansas City Fed, we have looked closely at the issue of financial education in the\n\nworkplace. Not only is this an innovative way to potentially reach individuals who might\notherwise go without assistance, there may also be benefits for the employer in addition to the\nemployee.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chicago Fed pioneered an innovative approach to cooperatively promoting\n\nfinancial education services through its Money Smart Week initiative. While this originated prior\nto the current crisis, it has provided an important tool in highlighting resources available for\nconsumers to use in these difficult times. The Kansas City Fed has taken this model on as a tool\n\nfor strengthening and expanding access to financial education services with similar programs\n\nthroughout our District.\nAlthough education is an important component, we also know that the complexities of our\n\nfinancial system can create questions for consumers who make even the wisest financial choices.\nAlthough the system has served the nation well, consumers can be uncertain about which\n\nregulatory agency can provide assistance for particular difficulties they may encounter. A\npartnership between the Minneapolis and Kansas City Feds addresses this problem, providing a\nhotline and an online resource to help consumers with their questions about specific financial\n\nproducts and institutions.\n\nConsumers need not know which regulator is the appropriate source for assistance, but can\nhim to FederalReserveConsumerHelp.gov or the related toll-free telephone number (888-8516\n\n\f1920) for a wide range of resources and assistance that can put them in touch with the appropriate\n\nregulatory authority. Call center staff members are available dining extended hours to talk with\n\nindividual consumers about specific problems and offer individualized assistance.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is only a very small sampling of our Community Affairs programs. And while I am\n\nmost familiar with the programs involving the Kansas City Fed, I know I speak for all of the\nReserve Bank presidents when I say that we take much pride in the work being done by our staffs\nin this area.\n\nI think it is important to note that many of these efforts have grown from the creativity of\n\nour local Community Affairs staffs located throughout the nation, and many of the most\n\ninnovative ideas have emerged in recent months. I believe we can expect this trend to continue as\nwe look to fully utilize the regional expertise, partnerships and programs to provide national\n\nsolutions.\nI hope this conference is beneficial to you. I know it is beneficial to us, the policymakers.\n\nThank you.\n\n7\n\n\f"

There has been much debate about how we should address these\nchallenges, but regardless of the method one supports, all agree that the economy will not\n\nrecover until the financial system is stabilized and credit flows improve.\nThe restoration of normal financial market activity depends on how we deal with the\n\nproblems of our largest financial institutions. It is has been a little more than a year since the first\n\nmajor government rescue occurred with Bear Steams being acquired by JPMorgan. Since then,\nnumerous programs have been enacted and trillions of dollars of public funds have been\ncommitted, much of it directly to our largest institutions. Despite these well-intentioned efforts,\n\nthe problems remain, and the public’s dissatisfaction with how their money is being spent grows.\nIt is not surprising that the initial measures taken in this crisis were ad hoc. The depth and\n\nextent of the problems were not anticipated. However, more than a year has passed and the\nchallenge that still remains is to define a plan that addresses the significant asset problems\n\nembedded in our largest institutions. We must provide financial firms, investors and consumers\n\nwith a clear and fair plan for dealing with firms that many call “too big to fail.”\nLast month, I gave a speech that outlined a resolution framework and a plan for how we\n\nshould deal with these large systemically important financial firms. I believe that failure is an\n\noption. Those who disagree with my resolution proposal say that it is unworkable, hi my remarks\ntoday, I will offer more details about how the process would work and explain why I think it is\n\nthe best solution for getting our financial system and economy on the road to recovery.\n\n2\n\n\fPrinciples for a Resolution Framework\n\nFor a free market system to be successfill, firms must be allowed to fail based upon a\n\npredefined set of rules and principles that market participants can rely on when determining their\nstrategies and making decisions. Tins is particularly important for problem financial institutions.\nThese key principles should apply if we are talking about a small bank in Tulsa or a large\n\ninternational financial conglomerate in New York City.\nThe first principle is to properly understand our goals and correctly identify the problems\n\nwe are attempting to solve. This may sound obvious. However, when we are in the middle of a\ncrisis where more than a half million people are losing their jobs every month, it is tempting to\npour money into the institutions thinking that it will correct the problem and get credit flowing\n\nonce again. Also, rather than letting the market system objectively discipline the firms though\n\nfailure and stockholder loss, we tend to micromanage the institutions and punish those within\nreach.\nThs lack of confidence in the market’s remedy is most acute for our largest financial\n\ninstitutions, which have publically disclosed substantial losses. The question that the supervisory\nauthorities must answer is whether the losses are large enough to threaten the solvency of any of\nthese firms. This assessment is the first step in determining actions necessary to restoring public\n\nconfidence in our financial system.\nA second principle is that we must do what is best for the overall economy and not what\nis best for one group. We need to make sure that when one financial firm fails, the resolution\nprocess does not cause significant disruptions to financial markets and the economy or make the\n\n\fcurrent problems worse. Furthermore, we must do it for the lowest possible cost so that we don’t\ncreate a long-term fiscal burden on taxpayers.\n\nIt is important to recognize that there are not just the direct costs but, more importantly,\nlong-term costs to the economy and financial system. The direc t cost of resolving a failed bank,\n\nsuch as the government bearing some of a failed bank’s losses, is simple to determine. However,\n\nit is much more difficult to know the costs from some of the unintended consequences. For\nexample, market discipline is reduced when a resolution process does not make management,\n\nshareholders and creditors bear the costs of their actions.\nThe third principle is equity of treatment. Regardless of an institution’s size, complexity\nor location, the resolution process must provide consistent treatment of a failing institution’s\n\nowners, managers, employees and customers. The process must be transparent and clearly stated\nso that everyone understands what to expect if they gamble with the film’s assets.\n\nWhen talking about equity of treatment, it is important to recognize that a single process\n\ncan lead to different outcomes. For example, if any bank is examined and found to be insolvent,\n\nit needs to go through the resolution process with the owners losing then investment. However,\nthe eventual outcomes for the institution can be different. A smaller bank’s assets and deposits\n\nwill likely be sold to another bank. In the case of a larger bank, the firm might be temporarily\n\noperated as a bridge bank before either being sold or reprivatized. Regardless, it is important that\nthe banks go through the same process or else an incentive will be created for banks to take on\nexcessive risks in an effort to grow large enough to gain favorable treatment.\n\nA final principle is that we must base the resolution process on facts about what works\nand what does not work. One way to do this is to look at past financial crises. This is not the first\n\n4\n\n\ffinancial crisis, and we can learn a lot about what will and will not be successful by looking back\n\nat our own history with financial crises, as well as at the experiences in other countries.\n\nIdentifying the Problem\n\nWith these principles in mind, how should we go about resolving the current problems at\nour largest institutions?\n\nFirst, we must determine both the location and size of the losses. Admittedly, it will not\nbe easy. These firms are very large - the four largest bank holding companies each have more\nthan $1 trillion of assets, which accounts for about half of the banking industry’s assets. They\n\nhave offices around the world, and they are involved in many complex businesses. But in order\n\nto repair the financial system, we must get the best estimates of the condition and viability of\nthese firms, and we must require them to reflect their losses in their financial statements.\n\nNormally, we think of a business’ solvency in terms of the value of its equity capital.\nWhen the value of its assets is less than the value of its liabilities, it has negative equity and it\n\nhas failed. A financial firm, however, can also fail if its liquidity is insufficient to meet its current\npayment obligations, either because it can’t sell its assets for enough to pay off maturing\n\nliabilities, or it loses market confidence and cannot borrow enough.\n\nI would note that these are concrete definitions and not subjective conditions. I mention\n\nthis because it points out that the term “too big to fail” is a misstatement. It does not matter what\nsize the firm is. Although a bank might still be open and operating, if it is insolvent by these\ndefinitions, it has failed.\n\n5\n\n\fOnce we determine a bank’s status, we would classify these institutions into three\ncategories, depending on whether they are solvent and what their prospects are for continuing as\nan ongoing concern.\n\nThe first category would be firms whose operations are strong and whose equity remains\n\nabove minimum requirements. These firms would not require much government support, if any.\n\nSome might need to raise additional capital to provide a greater cushion against the losses they\nmay suffer during the current crisis. But these institutions are basically sound and should be able\nto raise private capital.\n\nThe second category would be those institutions whose equity temporarily falls below\nminimtun requirements but are expected to recover in a reasonable period of tune as economic\n\nconditions improve. These films have generally sound management, who may have made some\nmistakes and suffered greater losses than normal due to the economic downturn. It is reasonable\n\nto expect these banks to raise additional private capital. However, the government may need to\nprovide some capital in the form of preferred shares and possibly some warrants in return. As an\n\nequity holder, the government would have an oversight role regarding the firms’ operations and\n\nactivities.\nThe final category is for the institutions that are no longer viable either because of\nliquidity problems or their equity capital is currently negative or it is likely to become negative,\n\nbased on reasonable expectations of future market and economic conditions. These firms, which\nwould likely soon become equity insolvent without government protections and guarantees,\n\nwould be declared insolvent by the regulatory authority. Shareholders would be forced to bear\nthe full cost of the positions they have taken and risk losing their investment. Senior management\n\nand the board of directors would be replaced because they are responsible for the failed strategy.\n\n6\n\n\fA Resolution Process\nThe question then becomes how to resolve these failed institutions while minimizing the\ncost and disruption to the economy.\n\nThe method most often used when a bank fails is to arrange for a sale of its assets and an\nassumption of its liabilities by another institution. For these extremely large firms, there are a\ncouple of significant roadblocks preventing this solution. First, the acquiring firm must have the\n\ncapacity for the acquisition, which means it would have to be in the same size range as the failed\ninstitution. And secondly, if such a deal was forged, it would create an even larger firm with\n\ngreater systemic risks to the economy.\nInstead, an extremely large firm that has failed would have to be temporarily operated as\na conservatorship or a bridge organization and then reprivatized as quickly as is economically\nfeasible. We cannot simply add more capital without a change in the firm's ownership and\n\nmanagement and expect different outcomes in the future.\nExperience shows that this approach has worked. The best example was with the failure\n\nof Continental Illinois National Bank and its holding company in 1984. Because we are in\nOklahoma today, I will note that Continental’s problems began with some bad loans it purchased\n\nfrom Oklahoma City’s Perm Square Bank. As an officer in out Bank’s regulatory function at that\n\ntime, I was directly involved in the closing of Penn Square. In fact, front 1982 to 1992, 347\nbanks failed or received FDIC assistance in the Tenth Federal Reserve District states. I was\n\ninvolved in almost every one of these resolutions and all were tragedies. I tell you this to make\nclear that I do not take this proposal lightly nor do I expect any size bank failure to be easy or\n\n7\n\n\fpainless. But the process that worked for Continental Illinois is a viable approach to addressing\n\nimportant aspects of today’s crisis.\nAt the time of its failure, Continental Illinois had $40 billion in assets and was the\n\nnation’s largest commercial and industrial lender. It was the seventh- largest bank in the United\nStates. It had 57 offices in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a large network of domestic and\n\ninternational correspondent relationships, and a separate function for making residential and\ncommercial real estate loans. It also provided specialized services to a variety of companies.\n\nWhen Continental failed, its top management and directors were replaced with\n\nindividuals who had experience operating large, complex organizations. John Swearingen,\nformer chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding company, and William\nOgden, a former vice chainnan of Chase Manhattan Bank, became CEO.\nThe FDIC committed to taking a book value of $4.5 billion of bad assets off of\n\nContinental’s balance sheet and placed them hr a separate work-out unit to recover as much of\nthe value of the assets as possible. Among those bad assets, $1 billion was written off as a loss at\nthe time of the transaction.\nTo offset the $1 billion loss to Continental’s capital, the FDIC provided $1 billion in\n\ncapital in exchange for preferred stock, of which $720 million was convertible to common stock\n\nupon sale. When converted, the $720 million would amount to a 79.9 percent ownership stake in\nContinental.\nThe FDIC also received five-year warrants to purchase the remaining common stock for\n\nfar below one cent per share ($0.00001). If at the end of five years, the cost of the resolution was\nmore than $800 million, the FDIC would exercise 100 percent of the warrants; if losses were\n\nlower, the amount of warrants exercised would be in proportion to the amount of the losses.\n\n8\n\n\fTo economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation unit\nwas staffed by a combination of FDIC personnel, hired specialists and Continental employees\n\nunder incentive contracts.\n\nContinental Illinois was fully reprivatized by 1991 and eventually purchased by Bank of\nAmerica in 1994. The FDIC exercised all of the warrants so the shareholders in Continental's\nholding company effectively lost their entire investment. The FDIC sold all of the preferred\nshares and shares from exercising the wanants for $1.2 billion, which was a net gain of $200\n\nmillion. The FDIC also earned $200 million in dividends. The ultimate resolution cost to the\nFDIC was $1.1 billion, which was 3.28 percent of Continental’s assets at the time of resolution.\nThere has been much talk lately about a new resolution process for systemically\n\nimportant firms that Congress could enact, and I would encourage this be implemented as\nquickly as possible, but we do not have to wait for new authority. We can act immediately, using\nessentially the same steps we used for Continental.\n\nStock could be issued and control assumed by a government entity. A bridge institution\ncould be created within the institution so essential services and operations would continue as\nnormal. Where necessary, the government would provide capital in exchange for preferred shares\n\nconvertible to common stock upon sale. Existing shareholders would provide the government\nwanants to purchase all outstanding shares with the amount exercised determined by the\ngovernment’s resolution cost. Senior management and directors would be replaced.\nThe most difficult part of resolving these large firms without a new resolution process is\n\nhow to make creditors bear the cost of their positions. Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing\nobligations would be addressed and dealt with according to the covenants and contractual\n\npriorities set up for each type of debt. Insured creditors would have immediate access to their\n\n9\n\n\ffunds, while other creditors would have immediate access to maturing funds with the potential\nfor haircuts, depending on expected recoveries, any collateral protection and likely market\nimpact. However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors,\nunless there’s a process that allows regulatory authorities to declare a nonbank financial firm\ninsolvent.\n\nRegardless of how the firm is resolved, short-term liabilities in particular would need to\nbe addressed immediately because of their importance in meeting the creditors’ daily payment\nobligations and operational needs. Quick decisions should also be made on all counterparty\n\narrangements because of the widespread impact that uncertainty would have on the\ncounterparties.\nAuthorities would also need to assess the market impact - specifically, whether the losses\n\nassociated with this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in financial markets and serious\n\nfunding problems that would threaten the viability of other financial firms. If so, it may be\nnecessary to honor all counterparty arrangements and/or short-term liabilities, as we did with\n\nContinental Illinois.\nHowever, this guarantee must be considered as an exception to the normal process.\nCongress would have to enact an approval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as\n\nspecified in the 1991 FDIC Improvement Act, requiring approval by two-thirds of the Federal\nReserve Board, two-thirds of the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Treasury, in consultation\n\nwith the president.\n\nAs much as I dislike extending government guarantees and thereby reducing market\ndiscipline, if we were to implement this exception, I believe we would also need to extend the\n\n10\n\n\fsame guarantees to all other institutions or we would give failed institutions a competitive\n\nadvantage.\n\nAnother key part of the resolution is that the bad assets need to be taken off the balance\nsheet of the failed institution at realistic market values and placed in an asset management\n\ncompany, resulting hi two entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”\n\nAlternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the receiver could take the bad assets and work them out.\nAfter writing off the bad assets, the government would provide the “good bank” with enough\n\ncapital so that it can become a profitable ongoing concern and attractive to private investors for\n\nreprivatization. Any recoveries horn the bad bank would first go toward paying off the costs of\nthe government, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of\nremaining claimants.\n\nThe separation of the bad assets is critical. When a bank has a large share of\nnonperforming assets, they remain a burden when they are left on the balance sheet, even if they\n\nare written down appropriately. For example, they must be funded although they are not\n\nproducing income. Such a circumstance creates uncertainty about the bank’s financial condition\n\nand diverts management's attention horn the business objectives necessary for recovery. The\nfocus of the “good bank” must be on the future, gaining new customers and expanding\n\noperations, while the goal of the “bad bank” must be on getting rid of customers and winding\n\ndown the operations.\n\nAs part of the reprivatization process, it is also important to determine the advisability of\nbreaking up or selling off operations and independent subsidiaries where possible, especially\n\ngiven the market discipline problems we have encountered with institutions regarded as “too big\n\nto fail.” Moreover, assessing the condition and viability of large, complex financial firms is\n\n11\n\n\fdifficult, and the failure of such a firm may be an indication that it is also too large and complex\n\nto manage well. We should avoid setting conditions that only repeat past mistakes in creating too\nbig and too complex an institution.\n\nThis system is clearly more equitable than what we have seen so far.\nAt the start of the TARP I program. $125 billion was provided to the nine largest\n\nfinancial firms without an in-depth, thorough exam of their condition. However, all other banks\nreceived TARP funds only if their primary regulator concluded they were strong enough to\n\nweather the crisis and continue as an ongoing concern.\nThe $10 per share that Bear Steams’ stockholders received from the JPMorgan Chase\nacquisition would not have been possible without the government’s guarantee of $29 billion of\n\nproblem assets. Additionally, the government has committed $173 billion to support AIG’s\ncontinued operations, with their shareholders standing to reap financial gam if AIG ultimately\n\nrecovers.\nMeanwhile. 46 banks in the United States have failed since the beginning of 2008. All of\n\nthem were resolved through one of the bank resolution problems I have discussed here today.\n\nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work?\n\nIt is understandable that there are concerns about letting these large firms fail, but it\nshould be noted that the program I have just described has a record of success elsewhere.\nThe economic situation in Sweden hi the early 1990s was similar to that in the United\nStates today. Its financial system was dominated by six large banks that accounted for 90\npercent of the industry’s assets. Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major\n\nfinancial institutions. The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through\n\n12\n\n\fprivate sources, and public authorities quickly took over two large insolvent banks and spun off\n\ntheir bad assets to be managed within a separate entity. Sweden was able to systematically\nrestore confidence hi its financial system, and although it took several years to work down and\nsell off all of the bad assets, there was minimal net cost to the taxpayers.\n\nSome argue that the Swedish situation is not a valid comparison because it dealt with\nonly six banks. In addition, some argue that the Swedish system was much less complex, and\nthat the Swedish government had to work out primarily commercial real estate loans instead of\nthe complex financial assets, structured securities and derivatives that we would have to work\nout today.\n\nThese are valid concerns, but I would point out, first, that although the United States has\nseveral thousand banks, only 19 have more than $100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory\n\nauthorities evaluate their condition, it is likely that few would require further government\nintervention. Second, as for complexity, I would point out that real estate assets involve\n\nconsiderable complexity, no less so than many financial derivatives.\n\nAnother important example is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which was\nused to deal with banking problems in the United States in the 1930s. The RFC followed a\n\nprocess very similar to what I have described. It began by examining problem banks and writing\ndown the bad assets to realistic economic values, making any needed and appropriate changes in\nbank management, injecting public equity as needed into these banks, and returning the banks to\nprivate ownership. The RFC proved to be highly successfill in recapitalizing banks, and like\n\nSweden, there was essentially no net cost to taxpayers. More detailed information on both the\n\nContinental Illinois and Swedish models for large bank resolution will be posted today with a\ntext of my remarks on our Bank’s website at KansasCityFed.org. Absent a detailed explanation\n\n13\n\n\fof why this approach can’t be done, it is my hope that it will be useful to provide more details\naround my view that it can be done.\n\nLet me make two final points.\n\nFirst, the debate over the resolution of the largest financial firms is often sensationalized\nbecause it is framed in terms of nationalizing failed institutions. It is also pointed out that\n\ngovernment officials may not be effective managers of private business concerns.\nIn response, I would note that no firm would be nationalized hi this program.\nNationalization is the process of the government taking over a going concern with the intent of\n\noperating it. Though a bridge institution is the most likely outcome when a large financial firm\nfails, the goal is for the firm to be reprivatized as quickly as possible, hi addition, subject to\n\nregulatory agency oversight, the bridge fmn would be managed by private sector managers\nselected for their experience in operating well-run, large, complex organizations.\n\nThe second point is related to the complexity issue, which is that it would be hard to find\n\nenough people with the required knowledge, experience and skills to fill the open positions.\nGoing back to the Continental Illinois example, we were able to do it then. More generally: The\n\nUnited States is a vast country with a tremendous amount of management resources in a broad­\nbased economic and industrial system. If the United States does not have the talent to run these\nfirms, then we are much worse off than I thought. I refuse to accept that conclusion.\n\n14\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFinancial Stability Institute, Bank for International Settlements\nHigh-Level Meeting on Recent Developments in Financial Markets and Supervisory Responses\nLima, Peru\nApril 2, 2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or\nrepresentatives.\n\n\fI am honored to be asked to provide some opening comments for this conference.\n\nOver the past year, we have all been heavily involved in the global financial crisis. As\npolicymakers and regulators, our mission during this turmoil is twofold. We are responding to\n\nemerging events, but at the same time we are also challenged with making the changes necessary\nto protect the financial system from a similar crisis in the future.\n\nSo, the urgency on all sides is certainly warranted. The time it takes to resolve these\nissues only increases the cost and further delays the potential for a frill global economic recovery.\n\nUnfortunately, urgency often creates an environment where quick decisions prevail over well­\n\nthought-out solutions. The focus in times such as these is often on proximate causes instead of\nunderlying problems. The current crisis, unfortunately, has been no different.\nThere were many events involved in this crisis, and as I react to them and consider what\n\nthey mean from a regulatory perspective, I would suggest three key areas that need to change.\n\nFirst, regulation must be based on a clear set of simple, understandable and enforceable\nrales rather that a set of broad principles open to interpretation.\nSecond, this has been the first real test of Basel II, and it has failed to achieve its\nobjective.\n\nThird, we must produce a means for resolving fnms that some would deem “too-big-to-\n\nfail.” These institutions do fail and we must allow them to do so in a way that controls damage to\nthe entire financial sector.\n\nPrinciples-Based vs. Rules-Based Regulation\nhi recent years, there have been increasing calls for the United States and many other\ncountries to shift toward a risk-focused and principles-based approach to supervision and\n\n2\n\n\fregulation. Unlike a rales-based system, which might establish maximum loan-to-value ratios or\nlimit the amount an institution can lend, a principles-based system specifies desired outcomes\n\nand allows the regulated firms extensive control over how they achieve those results.\n\nAs a regulator responsible for ensuring stability, I can sum up the argument of principles\nversus rules very simply in my mind: Principles provide financial institutions with opportunities\n\nto debate; rales provide supervisors with the best chance to properly enforce sound practices.\nThose who support a principles-based system say that with rapid growth in the financial\n\nmarkets, supervisors no longer have the resources to monitor compliance with every rale and\nregulation. They say the principles-based approach gives institutions more flexibility in adapting\nto a rapidly evolving financial environment, thereby making a country’s financial markets more\n\nattractive, innovative and competitive on a worldwide basis.\nTo that I would respond that a carefiilly crafted niles-based approach does not hamper\n\nfinancial innovation. Good rulemaking incorporates public comment, thus giving institutions an\nopportunity to suggest less burdensome and more effective ways to achieve regulatory goals, hi a\n\nniles-based environment, supervisors cannot just mechanically impose the rales on regulated\n\nfirms, but must rely on a good dialogue with the firms as an important part of the supervisory\n\nprocess.\nBecause principles must constantly be interpreted, a principles-based approach by its very\n\nnature fosters an environment of less clarity and reduced transparency in the regulatory system.\n\nWith issues open to interpretation, supervisors also have less power to enforce regulations when\nan institution disagrees. Tills problem is particularly serious when an economy is strong and\n\nquestionable activities may appear to be successful hi the environment of the time. The result is\nlikely to be a gradual erosion of regulatory standards during prosperous times and greater harm\n\n3\n\n\fto institutions and the broader financial system when the economic cycle reverses direction. If\nthere is one thing that we have learned from the current crisis it is that we must have a strong set\n\nof rules in place to limit any erosion in regulatory standards over the cycle.\nMy final concern with principles-based regulation is that for it to be effective, regulators\n\nand firms must have consistent goals and incentives. There must be rnuhral trust. Although I\n\nthink we would all like for this ideal to be attainable, we know in reality that it is extremely\ndifficult to achieve.\n\nGiven the events that led to our current crisis, it strikes me that we must reemphasize\nlongstanding and proven niles-based standards to limit excessive risk-taking. There must be a\nfirm framework for enforcing and achieving our supervisory objectives.\n\nBasel II\nMany of the same issues surrounding principles-based regulation versus a rules-based\nsystem also apply to Basel II. The main “principle” underlying the Basel II framework is that\n\ncapital requirements should be closely aligned with the risk assumed by the financial institution.\n\nBasel II relies on institutions making detailed assessments of the risks they have assumed\nso a more precise capital requirement can be assigned. Basel II, in fact, allows banks to use credit\n\nratings and their own internal risk models to measure these risks and calculate their capital needs.\n\nhi this regard, Basel II would replace a system that was based on broad “risk buckets”\nand a set of “rules” that determined what should go in these risk buckets and what capital would\nneed to be held against these specific risk-asset measures.\n\nWhether this shift to a more principles-based capital framework under Basel II is\nbeneficial will depend orr a number of the points that I noted previously.\n\n4\n\n\fThese points include:\n\n•\n\nWill the flexibility provided to banks in using their own risk models lead to better\noutcomes, or will they create greater supervisory enforcement and compliance\n\nproblems?\n•\n\nWill it be more difficult to get banks to build up and maintain higher levels of\ncapital during more prosperous times?\n\n•\n\nCan supervisors ensure that all banks operating under the Basel II framework\n\nfollow a consistent approach in measuring capital needs?\nThe difficulties with using models to measure risks are well-known to all of us. They\nhave become painfully apparent in the current financial crisis. Consequently, we must be\n\ncautious in how we set capital requirements and limit financial leverage. Models and credit\nratings don’t anticipate shifting risks very well.\n\nModels calibrated during periods of stress can overestimate risk and reinforce the\nprocyclical effects of capital regulation.\nEven more disastrous are calibrations performed during good times that can cause models\nto underestimate the risks of turbulent conditions and leave banks holding insufficient capital. An\nexample is provided by the experience of Britain’s Northern Rock. At the time of its collapse,\n\nNorthern Rock had calculated that it had substantial surplus capital under Basel II and was close\nto receiving regulatory approval to dividend out the “extra” capital to its shareholders.\n\nModels can fail to measure adequately a bank’s exposure to macroeconomic shocks and\nwill not measure risks not previously experienced. For example, many risk models clearly failed\nto anticipate the downturn in housing prices that we have seen over the last several years. A more\nspecific example is the counterparties to AIG’s credit default swaps, who took steps to protect\n\n5\n\n\fthemselves from credit risk by including collateral requirements in then swap contracts.\n\nHowever, the counterparties did not anticipate that AIG’s overall risk would exceed the amount\nof collateral it could provide. Consequently, the counterparties’ models did not indicate that\ncapital was needed for this exposure or that the institutions should shift their business away from\n\nAIG.\n\nAnother important problem is that models make enforcement of capital adequacy more\ndifficult. Examiners must try to understand and evaluate very complex mathematical models, and\nwhen these models appear to understate capital needs, examiners will have a difficult time\n\narguing the technical merits of their views and convincing bank management of a need to add\n\ncapital, hi too many cases, because management’ s ROE depends on reducing capital, the result\nwill be insufficient capital and excessive bank leverage.\n\nBanks have strong competitive and financial incentives to increase leverage. Leverage\n\nincreases profitability during good times, but it necessarily increases risk. We have seen the\nbroad systemic effects of excessive leverage in the current environment. hi many ways, the Basle\nII model-based capital regime provides banks with a rationale, a defense and an opportunity for\n\ntaking excessive leverage.\n\nOverleveraging has been a major problem during the current market meltdown - both\n\namong the institutions now operating under Basel II and among those that will soon come under\nthis framework.\nTo limit such problems in the future, we must maintain limits on financial leverage\n\nthrough strict rales that set a miniminn capital-to-assets ratio. This type of rale would be the\neasiest, most equitable and clear-cut way to set capital requirements for all sizes of banks and for\na broader range of firms throughout our financial markets.\n\n6\n\n\fA leverage standard would also be much harder to evade than capital standards based on\nan institution’s own estimates of risk exposure. I am particularly concerned that institutions that\n\nunderestimate their risk exposures under the Basel II framework will invariably hold less capital\nthan they need and be the first to have serious problems during a crisis. Consequently, as we\n\ndiscuss how we might strengthen the Basel II framework today, I believe we should also give\nattention to how we can underpin this approach with a strict rule on the amount of leverage an\ninstitution can assume. While leverage requirements are not a panacea for supervising financial\n\nfirms, it is clear that if you want to direct your resources to where you are most likely to have\n\nproblems, you can direct them to the more highly leveraged and weakened firms.\n\nA Resolution Framework for Institutions Deemed “Too Big to Fail”\nFinally, tills meeting will be looking at how we should deal with instihitions that are\nsystemically important or what many call “too big to fail.” Although discussions about\nsupervisory framework and capital regulation are vitally important, the idea that some\n\ninstitutions can be too big to fail, and thereby receive special treatment, is the most immediate\n\nconcern and the area where the actions so far have been most troubling.\nThere are very real and rapidly escalating costs that are being absorbed by the U.S.\n\ntaxpayers. There are also some very important questions that, in the name of “urgent,” have been\n\npushed to the side rather than addressed in a systematic fashion, hi recent weeks, you have seen\noutrage hi the United States over bonuses paid to some employees of AIG, which has received\nsubstantial government funding. We must think through carefully the consequences of well-\n\nintentioned but rushed decisions. Although the extreme costs of the bailout have received much\n\n\fof the attention, there are other fundamental questions about competitive fairness, capitalism and\n\nfinancial markets that must be considered as well.\nhi the interest of time, I will raise only one example right now. Currently, the stock prices\n\nof some of these “too big to fail” financial companies are hading for a fr action of their pre-crisis\nlevels, although billions of government dollars in the form of capital, loans and guarantees are\n\nbeing pumped into these films to avoid either capital or liquidity insolvency. If the government\nstays the current course and it works, the stock prices will rise. For a shareholder buying in at\n\ncurrent levels, a return to even half of what the shares traded at a couple of years ago could\ngenerate very large returns. So, not only are taxpayers picking up the tab for making these firms\nviable, they are also taking on an inordinate amount of the risk and leaving the rewards for\n\nprivate investors. And I suspect that as the markets become more confident that the government\n\nwill continue its support for “too big to fail,” the price of such shares will indeed bring handsome\nreturns.\n\nWith issues like this in mind, I recently gave a speech on this topic, titled. “Too Big Has\nFailed.” I would like to take a few moments to reiterate some of the key points concerning how\n\nwe might address this issue.\nOne comparison I drew was between Japan and Sweden. As you may recall, Japan took a\n\nvery gradual and delayed approach in the 1990s to addr essing its banking problems and put off\ndealing with a critical shortage of capital in its banks, hi contrast, after a severe real estate\n\ncollapse in the early 1990s, Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major financial\ninstitutions. The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through private sources,\n\nand public authorities quickly took over two large insolvent banks and spun off their bad assets\n\nto be managed within a separate entity. Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its\n\n8\n\n\ffinancial system at little cost to taxpayers, while Japan continued to have a weakened banking\nsystem for much of the 1990s.\n\nAnother important example is the Reconstruction Finance Coiporation (RFC), which was\nused to deal with banking problems in the United States in the 1930s. The RFC proved to be\n\nhighly successfill in using public funds to recapitalize banks with no net cost to taxpayers. This\nsuccess was based on the RFC’s adherence to a sound set of principles, beginning with writing\n\ndown the bad assets at a bank to realistic economic values and making any needed and\n\nappropriate changes in bank management before injecting public equity into the bank.\nA final example is the failure of Continental Illinois National Bank in 1984. Although\n\nContinental Illinois was essentially deemed “too big to fail” and was handled through an open\nbank assistance program, it showed that U.S. banking authorities could take over a very large\n\nbank, replace its management and wipe out stockholders, and then restore the bank to sound\ncondition and return it to private ownership.\nThere are several lessons that we can draw from these past experiences.\n\n•\n\nFirst, the losses in the financial system won’t go away - they will only fester and\nincrease while impeding our chances for a recovery.\n\n•\n\nSecond, we must take a consistent, timely and specific approach to major\n\ninstitutions and their problems if we are to reduce market uncertainty and bring in\nprivate investors and market funding.\n\n•\n\nThird, if institutions - no matter what their size - have lost market confidence and\ncan’t survive on their own, we must be willing to write down their losses, bring in\n\ncapable management, sell off and reorganize misaligned activities and businesses,\nand begin the process of restoring them to private ownership.\n\n9\n\n\fThe question that supervisors hi all countries must ask themselves is: How can we best\n\nresolve problems at financial institutions that are deemed to be “too big to fail”?\nOne guide to how we could proceed in the United States is the process we use for failing\n\nbanks. This approach - albeit far from perfect in dealing with “too big to fail” banks - has been\ndeveloped over time in response to previous crises and deals with many of the issues that need to\n\nbe resolved in today’s environment.\n\nOur bank resolution process focuses on timely action to protect depositors and limit\nspillover effects to the economy and the rest of the financial system. For instance, insured\ndepositors at failed banks typically receive immediate access to their funds, while uninsured\ndepositors often receive quick, partial payouts based on expected recoveries or, hi systemic\n\ncircumstances, may be frilly protected.\nAlso, we have a variety of means for resolving failed banks and ensuring a continuity of\nessential seivices. including selling all or part of a failed bank to a bank in sound condition or\n\noperating the bank under regulatory oversight through a bridge bank, conservatorship or open\nbank assistance. These options focus on bringing in capable management, while putting the\nshareholders at failed banks fust in line to absorb losses. The FDIC, as receiver for failed banks,\n\nmust pursue the least costly option - except in systemic circumstances - in order to protect the\n\ndeposit insurance fund and taxpayers.\nI support constructing a similar resolution program that we could apply consistently to all\n“too big to fail” institutions, including banks, bank and financial holding companies, and\nnonbank financial institutions.\n\nWithout going into details, I think a resolution plan for “too big to fail” institutions\nshould be based on several principles.\n\n10\n\n\fFirst, it must be equitable and consistent when compared to how other failing financial\ninstitutions and their customers are treated. Giving any type of institution special treatment will\n\nundermine confidence in the fairness of the financial system, increase moral hazard problems\n\nand provide incentives for taking greater risk.\n\nSecond, a plan must ensure timely action to protect customers and provide for a\ncontinuity of essential financial services, much like many countries have done in giving\ndepositors at failed banks immediate access to all or a major portion of their fimds. I would also\n\nargue for establishing a clear priority for handling claims, with shareholders and large unsecured\n\ncreditors having to bear the full risk of the positions they have taken. In addition, to prevent\ndelay's and political interference. I believe it is important to have a source of public fimds that\ncan be tapped for resolutions and for this resolution authority to be put largely under the control\nof independent supervisory agencies.\n\nWhile some have criticized this type of approach on the grounds that we would be\n“nationalizing” our financial system and that regulators are ill-equipped to take over and operate\na large institution, this is not what I believe or advocate.\n\nResolving problems at failing institutions is some tiling that public authorities have done\nmany times in the past. While it may take more time to work out the problems at larger\n\ninstitutions and return them to private ownership, this is still a temporary step that would be\n\ntaken with a limited number of institutions. Moreover, the experience of banking agencies in\ndealing with significant failures indicates that regulators are capable of bringing in qualified\n\nmanagement and finding specialized expertise when needed.\n\nIf we don’t take decisive steps to resolve major banking problems, I believe we will face\na much more serious set of issues. In fact, leaving failing institutions to continue their operations\n\n11\n\n\fwith a failed management team in place is certain to prove more costly in the long run and less\nlikely to restore public confidence and get us back on the path to recovery.\nFinns that rely on significant infusions of public funds have failed. We need to stop\n\npropping them up and start taking them apart in an orderly manner.\n\nConclusion\nBefore I conclude, I would like to make one final comment. There is no doubt that the\nmonths to come will be filled with talk about sweeping regulatory changes. The actions of the\nlast several months, rather than solving the problem, seem to have added only more questions to\n\nthe debate. I hope, in this instance, instead of being led down a path of “urgent” action, we\n\ncarefully consider solutions. In the United States, there is talk about the need for a financial\nstability regulator and who should fill that role. I believe that the Federal Reserve, by design, has\n\nthat responsibility and must start filling that role. Instead or rewriting the rule book, I think we\nneed to first enforce what is already there and do it in a fair and evenhanded manner that is not\n\ninfluenced by circumstances we decide are “special” because of the nature of the problem or the\nsize of the firm involved.\nThe current financial crisis is providing a very comprehensive test of our financial\n\nsystems and supervisory frameworks. We are all clearly interested in identifying what went\n\nwrong, what can we do to work our way out of today’s problems, and what we should do going\nforward. I am certainly looking forward to this meeting and hearing everyone’s views on the\n\nchallenges we face.\n\n12\n\n\f"

            "content": "TOO BIG HAS FAILED\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOmaha, Neb.\nMarch 6, 2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officer's or\nrepresentatives.\n\n\fTwo years ago, we stalled seeing a problem in a specialized area of financial markets\n\nthat many people had never heard of. known as the subprime mortgage market. At that time,\n\nmost policymakers thought the problems would be self-contained and have limited impact on\nthe broader economy. Today, we know differently. We are in the midst of a very serious\n\nfinancial crisis, and our economy is under significant stress.\n\nOver the past year, the Federal government and financial policy makers have enacted\nnumerous programs and committed trillions of dollars of public funds to address the crisis.\n\nAnd still the problems remain. We have yet to restore confidence and transparency to the\nfinancial markets, leaving lenders and investors wary of making new commitments.\n\nThe outcome so far, while disappointing, is perhaps not surprising.\nWe have been slow to face up to the fundamental problems in our financial system\nand reluctant to take decisive action with respect to failing institutions. We are slowly\nbeginning to deal with the overhang of problem assets and management weaknesses in some\n\nof our largest firms that this crisis is revealing. We have been quick to provide liquidity and\npublic capital, but we have not defined a consistent plan and not addressed basic\n\nshortcomings and, hi some cases, the insolvent position of these institutions.\n\nWe understandably would prefer not to “nationalize” these businesses, but in reacting\n\nas we are, we nevertheless are drifting into a situation where institutions are being\nnationalized piecemeal with no resolution of the crisis.\n\nWith conditions deteriorating around us, I will offer my views on how we might yet\ndeal with the current state of affairs. I’ll start with a brief overview of the policy actions we\nhave been pursuing, but I will also provide perspective on the actions we have taken and the\noutcomes we have experienced in previous financial crises. Finally, I will suggest what\n\n2\n\n\flessons we might take from these previous crises and apply to working our way out of the\ncurrent crisis.\nIn suggesting alternative solutions, I acknowledge it is no simple matter to solve.\n\nPeople say “it can’t be done” when speaking of allowing large institutions to fail. But I don’t\nthink that those who managed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the Resolution Trust\n\nCorporation, the Swedish financial crisis or any other financial crisis were handed a blueprint\nthat carried a guarantee of success. I don’t accept that we have lost our ability to solve a new\n\nproblem, especially when it looks like a familiar problem.\n\nCurrent Policy Actions and Problems\n\nMuch has been written about how we got into our current situation, most notably the\n\nbreakdowns in our mortgage finance system, weak or neglected risk management practices,\nand highly leveraged and interconnected firms and financial markets. Because this has been\n\nwell-documented, today I will focus on the policy responses we have tried so far and where\n\nthey appear to be falling short.\n\nA wide range of policy steps has been taken to support financial institutions and\n\nimprove the flow of credit to businesses and households. In the interest of time, I will go\nover the list quickly.\n\nAs a means of providing liquidity to the financial system and the economy, the\nFederal Reserve has reduced the targeted federal funds rate in a series of steps from 5.25\npercent at mid-year 2007 to the present 0 to 25 basis-point range. In addition, the Federal\n\nReseive has instituted a wide range of new lending programs and, through its emergency\nlending powers, has extended this lending beyond depository institutions.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and other regulators have also\narranged bailouts and mergers for large struggling or insolvent institutions, including Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac, Bear Steams, WaMu, Wachovia, AIG, Countrywide, and Merrill\n\nLynch. But other firms, such as Lehman Brothers, have been allowed to fail.\n\nThe Treasury has invested public funds, buying preferred stock in more than 400\nfinancial institutions through the TARP program. TARP money has also been used to fund\ngovernment guarantees of more than $400 billion of securities held by major financial\n\ninstitutions, such as CitiGroup and Bank of America. In addition, the Federal Reserve and\nthe Treasury Department have committed more than $ 170 billion to bail out the troubled\n\ninsurance company AIG.\n\nOther actions have included increased deposit insurance limits and guarantees for\nbank debt instruments and money market mutual funds.\n\nThe most recent step is the Treasury financial stability plan, which provides for a new\nround of TARP spending and controls, assistance for struggling homeowners, and a plan for\n\na government/private sector partnership to buy up bad assets held by financial institutions\n\nand others.\n\nThe sequence of these actions, unfortunately, has added to market uncertainty.\nInvestors are understandably watching to see which institutions will receive public money\nand survive as wards of the state.\n\nAny financial crisis leaves a stream of losses embedded among the various\nparticipants, and these losses must ultimately be borne by someone. To start the resolution\nprocess, management responsible for the problems must be replaced and the losses identified\n\nand taken. Until these kinds of actions are taken, there is little chance to restore market\n\n4\n\n\fconfidence and get credit markets flowing. It is not a question of avoiding these losses, but\none of how soon we will take them and get on to the process of recovery. Economist Allan\n\nMeltzer may have expressed this point best when he said that “capitalism without failure is\n\nlike religion without sin.”\n\nWhat Might We Learn from Previous Financial Crises?\nMany of the policy actions I just described provide support to the largest financial\n\ninstihitions, those that are frequently referred to as “too big to fail.” A rationale for such\nactions is that the failure of a large institution would have a systemic impact on the economy.\nIt is emphasized that markets have become more complex, and institutions - both bank and\n\nnonbank entities - are now larger and connected more closely thr ough a complicated set of\n\nrelationships. Often, they point to the negative impact on the economy caused by last year’s\nfailure of Lehman Brothers.\n\nHistory, however, may show us another experience. When examining previous\nfinancial crises, in other countries as well as in the United States, large instihitions have been\nallowed to fail. Banking authorities have been successful hi placing new and more\nresponsible managers and directors in charge and then reprivatizing them. There is also\n\nevidence suggesting that countries that have tried to avoid taking such steps have been much\nslower to recover, and the ultimate cost to taxpayers has been larger.\nThere are several examples that illustrate these points and show what has worked hi\n\nprevious crises and what hasn’t. A comparison that many are starting to draw now is with\nwhat happened in Japan and Sweden.\n\n5\n\n\fJapan took a very gradual and delayed approach in addressing the problems in its\nbanks. A series of limited steps spread out over a number of years were taken to slowly\nremove bad assets from the banks, and Japan put off efforts to address an even more\n\nfundamental problem - a critical shortage of capital in these banks. As a result, the banks\nwere left in the position of having to focus on past problems with little resources available to\nhelp finance any economic recovery.\nIn contrast, Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major financial\n\ninstitutions and insisted that solvent institutions restore capital and clean up their balance\n\nsheets. The Swedish government did provide loans to solvent institutions, but only if they\nalso raised private capital.\n\nSweden dealt firmly with insolvent institutions, including operating two of the largest\nbanks under governmental oversight with the goal of bringing in private capital within a\n\nreasonable amount of time. To deal with the bad assets in these banks, Sweden created wellcapitalized asset management corporations or what we might call “bad banks.” This step\nallowed the problem assets to be dealt with separately and systematically, while other\n\nbanking operations continued under a transparent and focused framework.\n\nThe end result of this approach was to restore confidence in the Swedish banking\nsystem hr a timely manner and limit the amount of taxpayer losses. Sweden, which\n\nexperienced a real estate decline more severe than that in the United States, was able to\nresolve its banking problems at a long term net cost of less than 2 percent of GDP.\nWe can also learn a great deal from how the United States has dealt with previous\n\ncrises. There has been a lot written attempting to draw parallels with the Great Depression.\n\n6\n\n\fThe main way that we dealt with struggling banks at that time was through the\nReconstruction Finance Corporation.\n\nWithout going into great detail about the RFC, I will note the four principles that\nJesse Jones, the head of the RFC, employed in restructuring banks. The first step was to\n\nwrite down a bank’s bad assets to realistic economic values. Next, the RFC would judge the\ncharacter and capacity of bank management and make any needed and appropriate changes.\n\nThe third step was to inject equity in the form of preferred stock, but this step did not occur\nuntil realistic asset values and capable management were in place. The final step was\n\nreceiving the dividends and eventually recovering the par value of the stock as a bank\nreturned to profitability and frill private ownership.\n\nAt one point in 1933, the RFC held capital hi more than 40 percent of all banks,\nrepresenting one-third of total bank capital according to some estimates. but because of the\n\nfour principles of Jesse Jones, this was all carried out without any net cost to the government\nor to taxpayers.\n\nIf we compare the TARP program to the RFC, TARP began without a clear set of\nprinciples and has proceeded with what seems to be an ad hoc and less-than-transparent\napproach in the case of banks judged “too big to fail.” In both the RFC and Swedish\n\nexperiences, triage was first used to set priorities and determine what institutions should be\n\naddressed immediately. TARP treated the largest institutions as one. As we move forward\nfrom here, therefore, we would be wise to have a systematic set of principles and a detailed\nplan to guide us.\n\nAnother example we need to be aware of relates to the thrift problems of the 1980s.\n\nBecause the thrift insurance fund was inadequate to avoid the losses embedded in thrift\n\n7\n\n\fbalance sheets, an attempt was made to cover over the losses with net worth certificates and\n\nexpanded powers that were supposed to allow thrifts to grow out of their problems. A\nnotable fraction of the thrift industry was insolvent, but continued to operate as so-called\n“zombie” or “living dead” thrifts. As you may recall, this attempt to postpone closing\n\ninsolvent thrifts did not end well, but instead added greatly to the eventual losses and led to\ngreater real estate problems.\n\nA final example — our approach to large bank problems in the 1980s and early 1990s\n\n— shows that we have taken some steps to deal with banking organizations that are\nconsidered “too big to fail” or very important on a regional level.\n\nThe most prominent example is Continental Illinois’ failure in 1984. Continental was\nthe seventh-largest bank in the country, the largest domestic commercial and industrial\n\nlender, and the bank that popularized the phr ase “too big to fail.” Questions about\nContinental’s soundness led to a tun by large foreign depositors in May of 1984.\n\nBut looking back. Continental actually was allowed to fail. Although the FDIC put\n\ntogether an open bank assistance plan and injected capital in the form of preferred stock, it\nalso brought in new management at the top level, and shareholders, who were the bank’s\nowners, lost their entire investment. The FDIC also separated the problem assets from the\n\nbank, which left a clean bank to be restructured and eventually sold. To liquidate the bad\nassets, the FDIC hired specialists to oversee the different categories of loans and entered into\na service agreement with Continental that provided incentive compensation for its staff to\nhelp with the liquidation process.\n\nA lesson to be drawn from Continental is that even large banks can be dealt with in a\nmanner that imposes market discipline otr management and stockholders, while controlling\n\n8\n\n\ftaxpayer losses. The FDIC’s asset disposition model in Continental, which used incentive\nfees and contracts with outside specialists, also proved to be an effective and workable\n\nmodel. This model was employed again in the failure of Bank of New England in 1991, the\n\nfailures of nearly all of the large banking organizations in Texas hi the 1980s, and also for the\nResolution Trust Corporation, which was set up to liquidate failed thrifts.\n\nResolving the Current Crisis\nTurning to the current crisis, there are several lessons we can draw from these past\nexperiences.\n\n•\n\nFirst, the losses in the financial system won’t go away - they will only fester\nand increase while impeding our chances for a recovery.\n\n•\n\nSecond, we must take a consistent, timely, and specific approach to major\n\ninstitutions and their problems if we are to reduce market uncertainty and\nbring in private investors and market funding.\n\n•\n\nThird, if institutions - no matter what their size — have lost market confidence\nand can’t survive on their own, we must be willing to write down their losses,\n\nbring in capable management, sell off and reorganize misaligned activities and\nbusinesses, and begin the process of restoring them to private ownership.\n\nHow can we do this today in an era where we have to deal with systemic issues rising\nnot only from very large banks, but also from many other segments of the marketplace? I\n\nwould be the first to acknowledge that some tilings have changed in our financial markets,\nbut financial crises continue to occur for the same reasons as always - over-optimism,\n\n9\n\n\fexcessive debt and leverage ratios, and misguided incentives and perspectives - and our\n\nsolutions must continue to address these basic problems.\n\nThe process we use for failing banks — albeit far from perfect in dealing with “too big\nto fail” banks — provides some first insight into the principles we should establish in dealing\n\nwith financial institutions of any type.\nOur bank resolution framework focuses on timely action to protect depositors and\nother claimants, while limiting spillover effects to the economy. Insured depositors at failed\n\nbanks typically gain frill and immediate access to their funds, while uninsured depositors\noften receive quick, partial payouts based on expected recoveries.\n\nTo provide for a continuation of essential banking services, the FDIC may choose\n\nfrom a variety of options, including purchase and assumption transactions, deposit transfers\nor payouts, bridge banks, conservatorships, and open bank assistance. These options focus\n\non transferring important banking functions over to sound banking organizations with\n\ncapable management, while putting shareholders at failed banks first in line to absorb losses.\nOther important features in resolving failing banks include an established priority for\nhandling claimants, prompt corrective action, and least-cost resolution provisions to protect\n\nthe deposit insurance fluid and, ultimately, taxpayers and to also bring as much market\n\ndiscipline to the process as possible.\n\nI would argue for constructing a defined resolution program for “too big to fail”\nbanks and bank holding companies, and nonbank financial institutions. It is especially\nnecessary in cases where the normal bankruptcy process may be too slow or disruptive to\n\nfinancial market activities and relationships. The program and resolution process should be\n\n10\n\n\fimplemented on a consistent, transparent and equitable basis whether we are resolving small\n\nbanks, large banks or other complex financial entities.\n\nHow should we structure this resolution process? While a number of details would\n\nneed to be worked out, let me provide a broad outline of how it might be done.\nFirst, public authorities would be directed to declare any financial institution\ninsolvent whenever its capital level falls too low to support its ongoing operations and the\n\nclaims against it, or whenever the market loses confidence in the firm and refuses to provide\n\nfunding and capital. This directive should be clearly stated and consistently adhered to for all\nfinancial institutions that are part of the intermediation process or payments system. We\n\nmust also recognize up front that the FDIC’s resources and other financial industry support\n\nfunds may not always be sufficient for this task and that Treasury money may also be\n\nneeded.\nNext, public authorities should use receivership, conservatorship or “bridge bank”\npowers to take over the failing institution and continue its operations under new\n\nmanagement. Following what we have done with banks, a receiver would then take out all or\na portion of the bad assets and either sell the remaining operations to one or more sound\nfinancial institutions or arrange for the operations to continue on a bridge basis under new\n\nmanagement and professional oversight. In the case of larger institutions with complex\n\noperations, such bridge operations would need to continue until a plan can be carried out for\ncleaning up and restructuring the firm and then reprivatizing it.\n\nShareholders would be forced to bear the full risk of the positions they have taken and\nsuffer the resulting losses. The newly restructured institution would continue the essential\n\nservices and operations of the failing firm.\n\n11\n\n\fAll existing obligations would be addressed and dealt with according to whatever\n\npriority is set up for handling claims. This could go so far as providing 100 percent\nguarantees to all liabilities, or, alternatively, it could include resolving short-term claims\nexpeditiously and, in the case of uninsured claims, giving access to maturing binds with the\npotential for haircuts depending on expected recoveries, any collateral protection and likely\nmarket impact.\nThere is legitimate concern for addressing these issues when institutions have\n\nsignificant foreign operations. However, if all liabilities are guaranteed, for example, and the\ninstitution is in receivership, such international complexities could be addressed\n\nsatisfactorily.\nOne other point in resolving “too big to fail” institutions is that public authorities\n\nshould take care not to worsen our exposure to such institutions going forward. In fact, for\nfailed institutions that have proven to be too big or too complex to manage well, steps must\n\nbe taken to break up their operations and sell them off in more manageable pieces. We must\n\nalso look for other ways to limit the creation and growth of films that might be considered\n“too big to fail.”\nIn this regard, our recent experience with ad hoc solutions to large failing firms has\n\nled to even more concentrated financial markets as only the largest institutions are likely to\n\nhave the available resources for the type of hasty takeovers that have occurred. Another\ndrawback is that these organizations do not have the time for necessary “due diligence”\n\nassessments and, as we have seen, may encounter serious acquisition problems. Under a\nmore orderly resolution process, public authorities would have the time to be more selective\n\n12\n\n\fand bring in a wider group of bidders, and they would be able to offer all or portions of\n\ninstitutions that have been restored to sound conditions.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nWhile hardly painless and with much complexity itself, this approach to addressing\n“too big to fail” strikes me as constructive and as having a proven track record. Moreover,\n\nthe current path is beset by ad hoc decision making and the potential for much political\n\ninterference, including efforts to force problem institutions to lend if they accept public\nfunds; operate under other imposed controls; and limit management pay, bonuses and\n\nseverance.\n\nIf an institution's management has failed the test of the marketplace, these managers\nshould be replaced. They should not be given public funds and then micro-managed, as we\nare now doing under TARP, with a set of political strings attached.\n\nMany are now beginning to criticize the idea of public authorities taking over large\n\ninstihitions on the grounds that we would be “nationalizing” our financial system. I believe\nthat this is a misnomer, as we are taking a temporary step that is aimed at cleaning up a\n\nlimited number of failed institutions and returning them to private ownership as soon as\n\npossible. This is something that the banking agencies have done many times before with\n\nsmaller instihitions and, in selected cases, with very large instihitions. In many ways, it is\nalso similar to what is typically done in a bankruptcy court, but with an emphasis on ensuring\na continuity of services. In contrast, what we have been doing so far is eveiy bit a process\nthat results in a protracted nationalization of “too big to fail” instihitions.\n\n13\n\n\fThe issue that we should be most concerned about is what approach will produce\nconsistent and equitable outcomes and will get us back on the path to recovery in the quickest\nmanner and at reasonable cost. While it may take us some time to clean up and reprivatize a\n\nlarge institution in today’s environment — and I do not intend to underestimate the difficulties\nthat would be encountered — the alternative of leaving an institution to continue its\n\noperations with a failed management team in place is certain to be more costly and far less\nlikely to produce a desirable outcome.\nIn a similar fashion, some are now claiming that public authorities do not have the\n\nexpertise and capacity to take over and run a “too big to fail” institution. They contend that\nsuch takeovers would destroy a firin’s inherent value, give talented employees a reason to\n\nleave, cause further financial panic and require many years for the restructuring process. We\nshould ask, though, why would anyone assume we are better off leaving an institution under\nthe control of failing managers, dealing with the large volume of “toxic” assets they created\nand coping with a raft of politically imposed controls that would be placed on their\n\noperations?\nIn contrast, a firm resolution process could be placed under the oversight of\n\nindependent regulatory agencies whenever possible and ideally would be funded through a\ncombination of Treasury and financial industry fluids.\nFurthermore, the experience of the banking agencies in dealing with significant\nfailures indicates that financial regulators are capable of bringing hi qualified management\nand specialized expertise to restore failing institutions to soimd health. This rebuilding\n\nprocess thus provides a means of restoring value to an institution, while creating the type of\nstable environment necessary to maintain and attract talented employees. Regulatory\n\n14\n\n\fagencies also have a proven track record in handling large volumes of problem assets - a\nrecord that helps to ensure that resolutions are handled in a way that best protects public\n\nfunds.\n\nFinally, I would argue that creating a framework that can handle the failure of\n\ninstitutions of any size will restore an important element of market discipline to our financial\nsystem, limit moral hazard concerns, and assure the fairness of treatment from the smallest to\n\nthe largest organizations that that is the hallmark of our economic system.\n\n15\n\n\f"

            "content": "The U.S. Economic Outlook:\nThe Aftermath of Leverage\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nThe Central Exchange\nKansas City, Missouri\nJanuary 7, 2009\n\n\f2\n\nI am pleased to once again be at the Central Exchange to share my outlook for the\neconomy. It doesn’t seem possible that it has been a year since I last spoke here and\nsuggested that though the economy was going to slow, there was still the possibility of\navoiding a recession. I thought we might avoid the recession if the housing market\n\nstabilized and the financial sector avoided further shocks.\n\nThe sad truth is that over the past year, the economy has been affected by several\nshocks - the further decline hi housing, the turmoil in financial markets, and a sharp drop\n\nin consumer and business confidence. With the benefit of hindsight, we should not be all\nthat surprised by the onset of these shocks. They are a consequence of excessive leverage\n\naccumulated over a decade, about which many of us expressed concerns.\n\nThe remedy to what we now face will require a rebalancing of domestic savings\nand investment within the U.S. economy. This rebalancing process and the length and\n\ndepth of the recession itself will be determined importantly by how quickly financial\n\nfirms, businesses and the consumer rebuild their diminished wealth and regain their\nconfidence. It will be influenced also by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented actions\n\nand funding programs and forthcoming fiscal initiatives.\n\nThese are challenging times to say the least, and for the next few minutes, I want\nto share with you my perspective on them. I will start with some background on what led\nto this recession and then describe for you my outlook for 2009. I also will provide what\ninformation I can on the policy actions being taken to influence this outlook. And let me\n\nsay at the outset that though I agree we must do all we reasonably can to revive the\neconomy, I caution, based on my years of experience, that in our haste to mitigate this\n\nrecession’s effects, we not attempt shortcuts that put at risk future stability and growth.\n\n\f3\nThe U.S. Economy is in Recession\n\nThe U.S. recession, we are told by the NBER, officially began more than a year\nago hi December 2007. In the third quarter of 2008, real GDP growth was -0.5 percent,\nand recent data suggests that the economy contracted at a much sharper rate in the fourth\n\nquarter.\nLabor markets have weakened considerably throughout the year. The\n\nunemployment rate has risen from 4.9 percent in January 2008 to 6.7 percent in\nNovember, and total employment has fallen by 1.8 million jobs. And, as evidenced by\nthe November employment report and recent layoff announcements, the deterioration in\nlabor markets has intensified.\n\nWorse yet, economic growth has slowed sharply in the rest of the world. Several\nEuropean countries along with Japan appear to be in recession. As growth in the rest of\nthe world slows, so does demand for U.S. exports, which was the one bright spot in the\n\nU.S. economy in 2008.\nFinally, as is usually the case with recession, inflation has moderated considerably\nin recent months. After surging in the earlier half of 2008, the headline price indexes fell\n\nsharply in October and November due to the steep fall in energy prices. Core inflation\n\nalso moderated following weak consumer demand and declining production costs from\n\nlower energy and commodity prices. But while inflation is receding for the moment, I\nmust remind you that monetary policy is extremely accommodative, and if it remains so\ntoo long, as history suggests it may, inflation pressures could re-emerge as the economy\n\nrecovers.\n\n\f4\nFinancial Leverage\n\nIt seems so clear now. doesn’t it, that the key factor underlying the current\neconomic downturn has been the behavior of financial institutions and consumers, who\nincreased their borrowing to unprecedented and ultimately unsustainable levels in the\n\nexcitement of the “boom” in housing. As the reality of this leverage finally emerged, its\neffects started to show most notably in August 2007. An asset-pricing crisis eventually\n\nwidened into a confidence crisis that spread tlnoughout the economy.\nBetween 2001 and 2007, in an environment of low and then slowly rising interest\nrates and easy credit availability, financial institutions dramatically increased their\n\npackaging and selling of mortgages in response to increased demand for these securitized\nassets. During this period of rapidly rising real estate prices, these assets were judged to\n\nbe safe, profitable investments.\nIn addition, we saw a singe in debt. Financial firms increased the level of\n\ndomestic financial debt from $8.5 trillion to $16 trillion, or by 90 percent. Mortgage debt\nincreased from $4.9 billion to $10.5 trillion, a 114 percent increase. And total public\n\ndebt outstanding increased from $3.4 trillion to $5.2 trillion. The building of assets\nthrough the use of debt was the way to easy wealth, so it seemed.\nWhen the rise in real estate prices stalled in late 2006, investors became\nincreasingly concerned about the value of these securitized, leveraged assets, hr August\n2007, the financial crisis emerged, bill force, as short-term lending began to seize up.\n\nThe firms most strongly affected by these events were, of course, those that “took\nadvantage” of one of the most aggressive leveraging periods in financial history. The\n\ndebt-to-capital ratios for the largest 10 bank holding companies in aggregate increased\n\n\f5\nover the past ten years from about 14 to 1 to over 21 to 1. The debt-to-capital ratios for\n\nthe investment banks were even higher at over 30 to 1.\n\nThe crisis that emerged as the implications of this leverage became more apparent\nresembled an old-style bank run. As problems developed and confidence waned many of\nthese institutions found themselves without funding. They were unable to sell their\n\nsecurities in the market given the concents about the value of the underlying assets.\n\nThese events caused a broad base of participants to pull out of the markets to the point\n\nwhere they no longer function properly.\n\nThe resolution of the crisis will occur when the deleveraging process hits bottom\nand financial institutions are able to resume their role as intermediaries. This I suspect is\n\ndependent on at least two factors.\n\nFirst, a stable market price needs to be established for the currently illiquid assets\nsitting on the balance sheets of financial institutions. Until these assets can be adequately\n\nvalued and losses absorbed and future losses staunched, financial firms are going to have\n\na difficult time raising capital and extending new loans.\n\nSecond, this will take time and will not be painless or simple to accomplish. It\n\nwill require actions by both the monetary and fiscal authorities that are well thought out,\nwell-defined, hilly disclosed, and firmly and consistently executed across all financial\nfirms. We have learned from events over this past year that this is no easy task.\n\n\f6\nConsumer Leverage\nA related event having substantial negative repercussions for the U.S. economy is\nthe fallout from the leveraging of U.S. consumers. Between 2001 and 2007, household\ndebt increased from 97 percent of disposable personal income to 133 percent. This\nmassive increase in borrowing was reflected most vividly through the increase of\n\nmortgage debt. The mortgage refinancing boom allowed homeowners to extract large\n\nquantities of equity from their homes at a time when house prices were appreciating\nrapidly. The overall result was that consumers spent at a rate roughly equal to their\nincomes, savings rates plunged to zero and borrowing soared.\n\nMuch of this borrowing was funded by foreigners. Between 2001 and 2007, the\n\ncurrent account deficit increased by 56 percent as our demand for imports greatly\n\nexceeded exports. Foreign holdings of total U.S. Treasury debt increased sharply from\n30 percent to 46 percent. Thus, while the United States spent, the rest of the world\n\nsupported our habit. Now we’re in withdrawal, and, yes, it is painfill.\nIn the past two years, household wealth has fallen sharply with declines in house\n\nprices and equity values. For example, homeowners’ equity share of household real\n\nestate has dropped from 55 percent to 45 percent, the lowest value on record. To\nrebalance and rebuild wealth, consumers are now increasing savings and decreasing\nspending. As I said, this is a difficult process, and without offsetting adjustments in other\n\nsectors of the economy, the effect of tills rebalancing is slower growth in real GDP.\n\n\f7\n\nThe Aftermath of Leverage\nIn the first half of 2008, the necessary structural adjustment began gradually.\n\nReal GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent while consumption grew at the slower\n\nrate of 1.0 percent. Over the last several years export growth was strong and the real net\n\nexport deficit decreased. For a while at least it seemed we might come through the\nadjustment relatively well. I certainly thought it was possible.\n\nBut, then, mortgage foreclosure problems worsened. In early 2008, Bear Steams\n\ncollapsed, followed later by a series of liquidity and solvency crises involving the GSEs,\nLehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and AIG. For investors, there was confusion regarding\nhow each was handled and how future problems might finally be resolved. The TARP\n\nwas introduced and changed several tunes as it was being implemented.\n\nThese events added to uncertainty across the economy, and the financial turmoil\nworsened, hr September and October, credit conditions tightened further, and businesses’\n\nand consumers’ confidence seemed to collapse. Indeed, although the early attempts to\n\nstaunch the recession were well-intentioned, it will be a subject of debate for some time\non whether the rush to action might have contributed to the worsening of conditions.\n\nhr the meantime, these developments contributed to the sharp decline of 3.8\npercent in consumption in the third quarter. And for the first time ever, the level of\n\nhousehold debt declined. Based on recent indicators, this decline hi consumption\ncontinued into the fourth quarter and has served to deepen the recession.\n\n\f8\nThe Outlook\n\nThe process of absorbing financial loss, increasing savings and decreasing\nconsumption, the pain of deleveraging, sets the context for the economic outlook. The\nhard fact is that the sharp deterioration of banking and credit conditions, the deepening\n\nslump in consumer and busmess confidence, and the ongoing housing correction must\nwork its way through the economy. While we must do what we can to mitigate the\n\neffects of this deleveraging process, to attempt to avoid its effects entirely is to repeat\n\npast mistakes and may sow the seeds for the next crisis.\n\nAccordingly, my outlook calls for the economy to contract further through much\n\nof 2009 until later in the year when the effects of policy actions begin to stimulate GDP\n\ngrowth.\nStarting with consumption, we will most likely see a contraction at least into the\nsecond quarter. Improvements in both consumption and savings will be hampered by\n\ndeclines in disposable incomes as firms continue to cut costs through layoffs, reductions\n\nof hours and pay cuts. This will be particularly hard felt by households this month when\nthe seasonal jobs during the holiday shopping season come to an end.\n\nThe outlook for business spending is also weak. Conditions in the manufacturing\nsector have worsened, and with this, the decline in corporate profits makes it unlikely that\n\nfnms will expand equipment spending until they see a rebound in consumer demand.\n\nSpending on structures is expected to contract markedly due to tight credit conditions and\nwaning demand for commercial building space.\nOf course, the outlook for residential investment remains weak as well. Housing\nstarts have fallen by 60 percent from peak levels in 2006, and the inventory of existing\n\n\f9\nsingle-family homes remains unusually high at an 11.5-month supply. The increase hi\n\nforeclosure rates in the near term is likely to contribute to additional housing price\ndeclines.\nEven the one recent source of strength for the economy, net exports, is expected\n\nto slow in 2009. After a robust expansion of U.S. exports in the first half of 2008, a rapid\nappreciation of the dollar combined with weakening world demand likely halted the\n\nexpansion of exports in the second half of the year. The recent decline in the dollar\n\nshould reverse this somewhat, but world demand is likely to be weak over the next\nseveral quarters.\n\nGovernment spending at the state and local level is expected to slow as budgets\nare cut hi response to a decline in tax revenues during this downturn. Government\n\nspending at the national level will provide a boost to the economy, depending on the size\n\nand content of the forthcoming stimulus package.\nPutting all of the pieces of the outlook together, the picture for the last quarter of\n\n2008 and at least the first half of this year is grim. The magnitude of the downturn is\n\nlikely to surpass that of the 1990 and 2001 recessions.\n\nWhile this immediate outlook is unsettling, over the longer horizon there is reason\nto expect that we can move through these difficulties and be a stronger economy when\n\nwe emerge from recession. If we pursue systematic policies with the right balance of\nmonetary and fiscal stimulus, the early signs of economic recovery could show\n\nthemselves as early as the third quarter of 2009. It would be foolish to attempt to\n\npinpoint the exact spark for the recovery, but there are important factors that should\n\ncontribute to this result.\n\n\f10\nFirst, the recent sharp decline in oil and gasoline prices does increase consumer\n\ndisposable income by billions of dollars, improve their financial position and serve to\nrestore confidence. Second, while the housing market will continue to struggle, low\nmortgage rates and some decline in inventory will serve to stabilize home prices and\n\nmoderate housing’s extended drag on the economy. Third, a gradual improvement in\n\nfinancial conditions will increase the supply of credit and encourage demand. And\nfinally, expansive monetaiy and fiscal policy will stimulate the economy and serve to\n\noffset some of those factors pulling it down.\nInflation will remain moderate over 2009 and much of 2010. Lower energy and\ncommodity prices along with moderate improvement in demand for goods and services\n\nwill keep price pressures temporarily contained. How prices behave beyond the\nimmediate horizon depends most critically on how the Federal Reseive conducts policy\n\nand manages its expanding balance sheet in a strengthening economy. This is no doubt\n\nthe central bank's most difficult longer-run challenge.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAs I already have suggested, the FOMC has responded to the financial and\n\neconomic crisis by steadily cutting the federal funds target rate from 514 percent in\nSeptember 2007 to its current range between 0 and 14 percent.\n\nIn addition, to provide continued support for the functioning of financial markets\n\nand to stimulate the economy, the Board of Governors, under provisions of the Federal\n\nReseive Act, has authorized the creation of several new liquidity facilities and the FOMC\nhas authorized the purchase of large quantities of additional assets for the Reseive Banks\n\n\f11\n\nto hold. The Federal Reserve has stated that with near-term inflation pressures\n\ndiminished, it is prepared to provide expanded liquidity to the markets as needed. Plans\ninclude implementing a loan program to facilitate the extension of credit to consumers\n\nand small busmesses.\n\nThese actions are unprecedented and are a powerfill stimulus to the economy for\n2009, but they come with their own set of risks. First, they are not designed to fix the\n\nproblems withm the financial industry but to go around the problem. They were taken\n\nbecause the intermediation process is broken, and financial institutions are thought to be\nin such a state that they are unable to expand their lending sufficiently to drive the\n\neconomic recovery forward.\n\nAs a result, the Federal Reserve is not only providing liquidity to the financial\n\nindustry, it is also taking on the financial industry’s role as intermediary to business\nfirms. This is a dramatic expansion of the central bank's role in the economy. It is\nreflected most vividly in the combined balance sheet of the 12 Reserve Banks, which has\n\nincreased from $900 billion in mostly Treasury securities in the fall of 2007 to $2.3\n\ntrillion in other assets today, and this will increase still further in the months ahead.\n\nThe Federal Reserve must now manage its balance sheet in a maimer that not only\nplaces liquidity into the economy but also in a manner that does not undermine the long­\n\nterm functioning of markets. It must design an exit strategy that at the appropriate time\nboth removes excess liquidity from the economy and allows it to withdraw as a\n\nsignificant intermediary. Failure to have such a strategy risks undermining an efficient\nfinancial market system.\n\n\f12\nSome of these facilities will automatically dissipate as the market’s intermediation\n\nprocess returns to a more normal state. But the Federal Reserve also will have to\nundertake specific, timely actions if we are to remove the accommodative policy in an\n\neffective manner. The importance of doing this correctly camrot be overemphasized. As\n\nI have suggested, we have sometimes been slow to remove our accommodative policy,\nand hr doing so, we have invited the next round of inflation, excess and crisis.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nFinally, a critical element affectirrg the recovery hr 2009 will be the introduction\n\nof additional fiscal stimulus into the economy. To this point, the current administration\nand Congress have takerr actions to recapitalize banks, and the FDIC has greatly\nexpanded its guarantees of bank liabilities. But these actions might be viewed best as\nholding actions, designed to keep the economy from deteriorating further and faster while\n\nother solutions are developed. The incoming administration’s stimulus package appears\n\nto involve expenditures for both short-term and longer-term projects.\n\nThe cost of the proposed actions is expected to exceed $700 billion and will\nalmost certainly boost the econo my in a time of recession. In the longer run, as we know,\nthis too brings risks that cannot be ignored. It will add to our burden of managing a\n\nrapidly expanding national debt at the same time that we will be confronted with the\n\nlooming obligations from rising Social Security, Medicare and defense expenditures. But\nfor the moment, putting our economy back on its feet is the priority, and with the\nmonetary and fiscal actions that are underway, we should see improvement as we enter\n\nthe second half of 2009.\n\n\f13\n\nConcluding Comments\nIn the end, the greatest challenge that I see for the U.S. economy is not just the\n\nrecession we are now suffering through but how we choose to address it. There are no\n\nshortcuts to stability, no painless methods to adjusting our saving-spending mix and\nreturning to prosperity. We want to successfully get through this difficult deleveraging\n\nprocess, rebuild our national savings and wealth, and we want to do it in a fashion that\ndoes not sow the seeds of the next crisis. As we provide needed liquidity to the financial\nsystem to contain the crisis, we must be careful to build public confidence by assuring\nthat our actions across financial firms are consistent, open, and understandable to the\nmarket and the public. We also must be patient and consider the long run. We must\n\nprovide for an environment of stable prices and manageable debt levels so necessary for\n\nsustainable growth in our national income. If we fail to meet this mandate, we will only\n\nrepeat the cycle of inflation, excess and crisis.\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nInstitute of International Bankers\nManaging Financial Crisis in a Competitive World:\nNational Regulation vs. Global Markets\nNew York, New York\nNovember 17, 2008\n\n*The views expressed in this speech are solely the those of Thomas M. Hoenig and are not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City or the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fI am honored to be asked to speak at this conference. Today’s program addresses a most\ntimely and critical set of issues — our response to the current market turmoil and the longer term\nproposals for restructuring the U.S. regulatory system.\nIn setting the stage for this conference, I would note that the current financial crisis is\nposing new challenges for central bankers and policymakers, taking them well beyond the\ntraditional framework they have used to address previous crises. In part, these new steps reflect\ndramatic changes in the financial system — most notably a substantial growth in that part of the\nmarket not covered by traditional public safety nets, along with a rising complexity in financial\ninstruments, counterparty risks, and institutional relationships on both a domestic and global\nbasis.\nThese developments are complicating efforts to respond to the current crisis, while also\nrevealing serious shortcomings in our crisis management framework. For example, many of the\nsteps taken have raised important issues with regard to moral hazard and the subversion of\nmarket discipline, equitable treatment of different institutions and segments of the market, and\npublic interference in credit allocation and other market processes.\nThese issues strongly suggest a need to look carefully at what we have done and consider\nwhat principles should guide any further steps we take in addressing the crisis. Moreover, it is\nappropriate to begin thinking about how we might construct a clearer set of rules and policies to\nhelp create more resilient financial markets and a better crisis management framework for\nresponding to future events. Such thought should also include exit strategies for how we can\nterminate the numerous temporary assistance programs adopted in this crisis and restore the\nprivate market incentives we have sacrificed.\n\n1\n\n\fMany aspects of the current crisis will be covered in today’s program, and I have chosen\nto focus my remarks on three policy issues: (1) How will we determine which institutions are to\nbe covered by the public safety net and, accordingly, subject to close supervision? (2) What is\nthe appropriate scope for central bank lending? and (3) How should we resolve solvency\nproblems at nonbank financial institutions? Before proceeding, though, I would like to briefly\nshare my perspectives on some of the general lessons we have learned from the crisis.\nWhat Have I Learned?\nOne of the most obvious observations from the current turmoil is that a crisis can stem\nfrom parts of the financial market not covered by traditional public safety nets. In past crises, we\nhave typically been able to direct our efforts toward banks and other depository institutions\nwhere we have safety nets and a supervisory and regulatory framework to address institutional\nproblems and restore market confidence. However, many of the institutions and markets now\nunder stress are not subject to prudential oversight. They are not protected by well-defined safety\nnets and, when assistance is provided, do not have a framework in place to help address moral\nhazard and other policy issues.\nAlso, when confidence is fragile and the risk of contagion is great, central banks and\nother public authorities increasingly are compelled to provide extensive liquidity and other\nassistance to the nonbank portion of financial markets. In this regard, it is clear in the United\nStates that whenever threats to financial stability occur, the financial markets, the public, and the\npolitical authorities all look to the Federal Reserve to respond regardless of where the threats\noriginated.\nWe should further acknowledge that an enormous burden has been placed on monetary\npolicy to respond to the current crisis, although monetary policy is not designed to address many\n\n2\n\n\fof the underlying factors, particularly when the problems extend beyond liquidity and raise\nissues of solvency and informational shortcomings. Going forward, it will be essential that our\nfinancial system have a wider range of policy and market-based options to resolve crises, with\nless reliance being placed on monetary policy.\nHow Will We Determine Which Institutions Should Be Covered by the Safety Net?\nBecause many of the problems in this crisis are linked to institutions and markets not\ncovered by traditional public safety nets, we clearly need to rethink what our approach should be\nin providing assistance to these segments and, accordingly, in extending oversight and regulation\nto them.\nAs we begin to think about these issues, I believe it is important to have a clear\nunderstanding of what we are trying to accomplish. In my view, a public policy objective of\nmaintaining financial stability should involve two key features: preventing credit disruptions\nemanating from financial markets and financial institutions from adversely affecting the broader\neconomy, and maintaining the integrity and functioning of the payments system.\nFrom a historical perspective, safety nets and supervision have been tailored to the\nspecific charters under which financial institutions operate and offer products. As a result of\ncompetition and financial innovation, many of the distinctions between financial institutions and\nproducts are eroding. The current crisis, along with this growing convergence among\ninstitutions, raises many questions about what criteria should be used and how far we should go\nin deciding which institutions should operate under safety nets and prudential supervision.\nIn general, I favor limiting the scope of our federal safety net. In a number of ways, we\nstruggle in dealing with banks that are regarded as too big to fail and in finding the appropriate\nbalance between market and supervisory discipline. Such problems would be greatly magnified\n\n3\n\n\fif we were to permanently extend the safety net to encompass a growing range of institutions and\nmarkets. I am especially concerned that we could put ourselves in the position of mixing\nbanking and commercial activities if we were to extend financial assistance to firms conducting a\nwide range of activities. Such assistance could put public authorities further into the process of\nallocating credit and selecting the winners and the losers in the marketplace.\nHaving said that, we still need to look carefully at the safety net issue and think about\nwhat we should do, given the likelihood we will have to deal with problems in the broader\nfinancial markets again. Can we design a more limited safety net for this part of the market,\nsupported by an equally limited system of oversight and regulation? Can we accomplish this\nwithout stifling the type of innovation that makes our markets more efficient and more\nresponsive to customer needs?\nI am not sure any of us have a good answer to these questions. I have several suggestions\nthat I would make, focused on trying to lessen the need for safety nets.\nBecause overleveraging has been a major problem during the current market meltdown, I\nwould suggest extending some form of leverage standards — a minimum capital-to-assets ratio\n— to those portions of the market that have suffered from inadequate capital. This type of\ncapital standard would also help reinforce the pressure that financial investors and creditors are\nnow putting on firms to raise capital and clean up balance sheets.\nIn this regard, I have always supported simple leverage standards for financial\ninstitutions. If we extend capital standards to a broader range of firms, a leverage ratio seems\nmore advisable to me than risk-based capital standards, which are likely to be far more complex,\nprocyclical, and, in many ways, easier to evade. In fact, I am most concerned that any institution\nthat tends to underestimate its risk exposure — as many recently have — will be just as likely to\n\n4\n\n\funderestimate its capital needs if allowed to operate a risk-based capital standard, such as Basel\nII. Risk-based capital standards may also encourage institutions to lower their capital, instead of\nbuilding it up, in the prosperous times that typically precede a crisis.\nI am also intrigued by the ideas presented at our Bank’s Jackson Hole Symposium this\nyear for making capital vary in a more beneficial way over the business cycle and during a crisis.\nOne such idea is the use of capital insurance to facilitate a financial institution’s recapitalization\nduring a systemic financial crisis. Another related idea is mandatory debt-equity conversions to\nsupplement capital in a financial crisis and to provide more discipline on the part of bondholders.\nAs part of any such recapitalization, I would support the mandatory cessation of dividend\npayments with the loss of earnings.\nSupervisory oversight of institutions that affect an economy’s financial stability is\nimportant. And, the most difficult aspect of this is that we balance supervisory authority and\ncapital requirements against the need to maintain financial innovation and not drive activities\ninto less-regulated markets. This is one reason why I would prefer to limit the safety net to\nprotecting the intermediation and payments mechanisms, while giving market forces as much\nlatitude as possible to guide financial innovation.\nThere may also be other ways that we can strengthen institutions and markets while\nlessening the need for safety nets. I have long supported increased public disclosure. With the\ninformation problems present in today’s markets, we need to work with market participants in a\nconcerted effort to improve disclosures and remove as much of the complexity and opaqueness\nas we can.\n\n5\n\n\fOverlapping these questions about the safety net and eligible institutions are two further\nissues: the appropriate scope of central bank lending and the resolution of solvency problems at\nnonbank financial institutions.\nWhat Is the Appropriate Scope for Central Bank Lending?\nTraditional central bank lending has been through the discount window with eligibility\ngenerally restricted to depository institutions. For the most part, central bank lending has also\nbeen short-term and fully collateralized with sound assets. During the current crisis, though, the\nFederal Reserve and a number of other central banks have chosen to expand the use of their\nlending facilities.\nFor the Federal Reserve, these efforts have included a number of different measures: a\nTerm Auction Facility designed to increase liquidity among depository institutions; an expanded\nsecurities lending program with broader collateral requirements to make illiquid securities more\nliquid; a primary dealer credit facility to increase liquidity at investment banks; lending to fund\nthe resolution/workout of several large nonbank financial organizations; and most recently,\nfunding to support money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market.\nThis broadening of central bank lending reflects, in part, the expanding role that nonbank\nfinancial institutions and more complex financial instruments play in the system. A key question\nnow for central banks is: Should central bank lending return to its traditional role once the\ncurrent crisis abates, or is this broader role the new reality?\nBroadening the scope of central bank lending has raised a number of issues, some old and\nsome new. A long-standing concern is that central bank lending should not be used to prop up\ninsolvent institutions, allowing them to take further risks that could end up costing the taxpayer.\n\n6\n\n\fBut the broadened scope of central bank lending raises new issues as well. For example, why\nshould institutions and financial markets maintain much liquidity on their own if they know\ncentral banks are likely to provide it when needed? Related to this is the idea that central banks\nmay be subsidizing access to liquidity for a growing list of borrowers. In addition, an expanded\nrole for the discount window may bring central banks more directly into allocating credit as\ncollateral requirements are selectively relaxed and lending is used to support specific segments\nof the market.\nWhile it may be too early to decide how central bank lending should be used going\nforward, we should start developing the basic principles that will guide its operations. Here are\nsome ideas that I suggest for consideration.\nI have already indicated my preference for putting some bounds on the federal safety net.\nBut if the discount window — as part of that safety net — is to be available to a broader range of\ninstitutions, then these institutions should be subject to some form of oversight and regulation to\nreduce moral hazard concerns. This oversight would help bring lending to nonbank financial\ninstitutions into closer conformity with that of depository institutions.\nWe should also think of how central bank lending could be structured to keep it from\nbeing a subsidized source of liquidity. Since this lending is essentially a line of credit, one idea\nwould be to charge a fee for access, and then require institutions seeking emergency access\nwithout a funded line of credit to pay a higher penalty rate.\nA final consideration is how far central bank lending should be extended. As I noted\nearlier, the focus should be on protecting the intermediation process and the payments\nmechanism. Because of the credit allocation issues and other concerns, I would argue for at least\n\n7\n\n\fdrawing a sharp line between banking and commerce, with our discount window only used to\nfund institutions and markets that play strictly a financial role.\nHow Should We Resolve Solvency Problems at Nonbank Financial Institutions?\nOne other key issue arising out of the current crisis is our approach in dealing with\nnonbank institutions that face solvency crises. Major examples of this now include Bear Stearns,\nLehman Brothers, AIG, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In each case, a unique approach has\nbeen followed. To some extent, these approaches reflect differences in the structure and\nexposures of these institutions. In some cases there were rushed decisions on whether they are\ntoo big to fail. However, it is apparent that we would benefit from a clear set of rules for\nhandling such firms, much like we have established to deal with failing depository institutions.\nAs it is now, we only have two, more problematic choices: putting together ad hoc rescue\npackages or relying on the more drawn-out corporate bankruptcy process, which may raise added\nconcerns and liquidity problems during a financial crisis.\nWe have some history in the United States on how to deal with large failing banks. This\nexperience is far from perfect, especially with regard to banks viewed as too big to fail, but we\nhave been able to construct a resolution framework that safeguards our payments system and\nhelps to maintain public confidence in the banking system.\nFor example, our bank resolution framework focuses on timely action to protect\ndepositors and other claimants. Insured depositors at failing banks typically regain full and\nimmediate access to their funds, while uninsured depositors often benefit from quick, partial\npayouts based on expected recoveries. Also, a continuation of many banking activities and\nrelationships is likely to occur given such resolution options as deposit transfers and asset sales\nto other banks, purchase and assumption transactions, bridge banks, conservatorships, and open\n\n8\n\n\fbank assistance. Other important features of the bank resolution framework include depositor\npreference statutes and a clear priority for handling other claimants, as well as an orderly\nreceivership process with limited allowance for judicial intervention.\nIn addition, we have a system of prompt corrective action by supervisors and, in the case\nof failure, bank resolutions that impose the least possible cost on the FDIC. These provisions\nhelp to promote a resolution of banking problems before they can become magnified and more\ncostly to the industry and, ultimately, to taxpayers. Requirements for least-cost resolutions and\npriority of claimants also help to put stockholders, subordinated debtholders, and uninsured\ndepositors at risk, thereby lessening some of the moral hazard concerns associated with the\nfederal safety net. Exceptions to least-cost resolution can be made when the failure of an\ninstitution could pose a systemic risk, but even in such cases, regulators can still make\nstockholders and managers bear the risk of their actions.\nI offer the thought that similar principles should be followed in setting up a resolution\nprocess for other types of financial institutions. The uncertainty that surrounded recent workouts\nof nonbank institutions has not only lowered market confidence, but also provided inconsistent\ntreatment of stockholders and creditors. In addition, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers has\nraised doubts about how different claims will be handled and how long the court and\nreceivership process will take.\nIn establishing a resolution process for nonbank financial institutions, there are a number\nof important principles to follow and several issues to consider. First, whatever the range of\ninstitutions granted access to the public safety net, we must design a process that limits moral\nhazard concerns and encourages market discipline. In particular, we must acknowledge that the\nmarket will make better decisions on capital and leveraging when investors and management are\n\n9\n\n\fsubject to the possibility of loss. As a result, nonbank resolutions or takeovers should leave\nstockholders and subordinated debtholders fully exposed to the losses in their firms. In the same\nway, such resolutions should provide for new management and directors either through a merger\nwith a sound institution or the insertion of a new management team.\nOther resolution steps should be structured to help ensure a continued flow of financial\nactivities, especially with regard to custodial accounts and any short-term claims that might harm\ncounterparties if not resolved in a timely manner. A continuity of operations could be facilitated\nthrough mergers, conservatorships, or something similar to the FDIC’s bridge-bank powers,\nespecially for large institutions that might pose a systemic risk if their operations were disrupted.\nI would also suggest using something similar to open-bank assistance for nonbank\nfinancial institutions that appear to be viable. However, this is only provided the assistance is\nstructured in a manner that does not subsidize stockholders or creditors or enable institutions to\ntake on more risk. As in banking, the authority to take action in a timely manner would help to\nreduce losses and best protect customers and creditors and their access to accounts and funds.\nA final set of issues is how to fund resolutions at nonbank financial institutions and who\nwould be in charge of the process. In order to protect taxpayers, I believe that industry\nresources, wherever possible, should be used to provide the major source of funds — much like\nin banking with the deposit insurance fund. We should be giving thought to how such a fund\ncould be established, particularly for less-regulated portions of the financial markets.\nConcluding Comments\nIt is clearly time to take a comprehensive look at our financial system and its regulation.\nWe have experienced financial crises in many different parts of the world over the past few\n\n10\n\n\fdecades, and the current financial crisis may be the most extensive one we have experienced\nsince the 1930s.\nOver the last year, central banks and other public authorities have taken a nearly\nunprecedented series of steps — steps that virtually all of us would admit are well outside of our\ncomfort zones. Also of concern to me is that recent public actions may result in unintended\neffects, most notably in terms of creating unwelcome incentives, unjustly favoring selected\nparticipants and segments of the financial markets, and putting taxpayers at significant risk.\nTo address these issues and concerns, we need to have a clearly understood framework to\nmake our financial system more resilient in the face of unexpected events and to resolve\nproblems in our financial markets when they invariably arise. In keeping with these objectives, I\nhave tried to present a few ideas and basic principles this morning for how we might structure\npublic safety nets, discount window lending, and resolutions of large nonbank financial\ninstitutions.\nThere are obviously many issues to be resolved as we go forward, and I will certainly be\ninterested in finding out what ideas all of you have. I am sure this conference will offer many\ninteresting insights into handling the current financial crisis, as well as thoughtful ideas for\nlonger-term reform.\n\n11\n\n\f"

            "content": "THE FINANCIAL CRISIS .AND THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nInstitute of International Bankers .Annual Breakfast Regulatory Dialogue\nWashington, D.C.\nOct. 13,2008\n\n\fI am delighted to be here today.\n\nObviously, we have experienced several shocks in this country, from housing to\nthe financial implosion to the commodity price shocks and now a dramatic loss of\nconfidence in the institutions of credit.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been involved in tins from the start. We have engaged in\n\na new scope of broadening our lending facilities and are now lending outside of the\nimmediate commercial banking area. Within the banking area we have expanded our\n\nprimary credit. Through our Tenn Auction Facility, we’re lending well over $140 billion.\n\nOur primary dealer facility has been involved with well over $70 billion of lending. Our\nforeign exchange swaps have been more than $600 billion. Our money market mutual\n\nfund liquidity provision has more than $140 billion, and we are involved in a commercial\npaper facility as well. In the meantime, we have lowered our fed funds rate from 5% to\n1XA percent. Each of these steps has provided important liquidity within the system as we\n\nhave tried to work tlnough this problem.\n\nThis is in addition to the other bailouts, starting with Bear Stems and continuing\ntlnough the most recent $700 billion initiative, which is daunting to say the least.\n\nNow, the financial industry itself has to step up. While the leadership and actions\nof the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are necessary and of utmost importance, we\n\ncannot do it alone. We need our 21st century J.P. Morgan, who also led Wall Street and\nthe financial sector when the nation was in a financial crisis 100 years ago. A very\n\nimportant part of this is willingness to cooperate and trust one another. Rather than every\nman and woman for themselves, I think the financial industry has to come together and\n\nsay, “How can we handle this?” If it doesn’t, credit won’t be released no matter what\n\nsteps policymakers might take. We have to get beyond the fear and work forward. If the\nFederal Reserve provides liquidity and the Treasury provides significant capital, then the\nfinancial industry can and should step up to the challenges of making loans to credit­\n\nworthy borrowers.\nThe regulatory bodies, the Federal Reserve, the Comp trailer of the Currency, the\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, along\nwith the other regulatory agencies around the world, also have to fill their role hr working\n\n\fwith the industry, not overreacting, but at the same time pushing us toward solutions.\nThat will be one of our major challenges.\nIf the International Monetary Fund is correct, the estimated financial losses for\n\nU.S. originated credits are a little less than $1.5 trillion, more than half of that has been\ncharged off and some of that has been recapitalized already. So the proposal that you\n\nheard described here today, I think, has the wherewithal to address the remaining capital\n\nneeds of the industry\nWe have to show the confidence that the plan will work and then begin to act\naccordingly if we are going to move through this crisis. The fact is that we have been in\n\ncrises before, we’ve managed through them and we will do it once again. I was involved\nin supervision and regulation during the banking crisis in the 1980s. During those trying\n\ntimes it seemed every bit as tense as the crisis we have now. But steps were taken, plans\n\nwere implemented, we got through it and we were wiser for it.\nI also think if s important that although problems seem to overwhelm us that we\n\nstop at this point and look into the future, knowing this crisis will pass. Central banks are\ncharged with being concerned with the long run, and we need to think about resolution\nand some of the reforms that will be needed as we go forward.\n\nAs we begin this process we must be careful not to misdiagnose the problem. In\n\nsaying that, I would also note that, despite some people’s views, the supervisory structure\n\nis not the cause of this crisis. There is almost an infinite variety of regulatory structures,\nfrom the multisupervisory structure of the United States to the Financial Services\nAuthority in Great Britain. No structure seems to have done particularly better or worse\n\nthan another in preventing these imbalances, the resulting problems and panics.\nThe hard truth is the crisis was seen coming and the warnings were mostly\n\nignored dining the boom. The regulators also failed to say “no” or insist on contingency\n\nplans during that boom time, hr addition, we need to introduce better countercyclical\nsafeguards to better assure we do not face this again in the future. I am aware that when\n\ntimes are good it is very difficult to impose constraints on the institutions that are\nenjoying the good times.\nOne of the debates that will come out of this debacle, for example, is principles-\n\nbased supervision or rules-based supervision. Based on my own experiences, I am very\n\n\fmuch supportive of a rules-based program. Principles-based solutions usually become\n\nvague, they’re subject to volumes of regulatory interpretations and they become more\nprocyclical than countercyclical.\n\nI would suggest that any approach we might one day adopt must have three\nelements to it. The rules need to be relatively simple, understandable and enforceable.\nThe more complexity there is to a set of principles, the less likely they are to succeed.\n\nFor example, one of our major challenges will be the Basel capital proposal. Risk­\nbased capital, as we have attempted to build it has become increasingly complex and\ndifficult to understand and has provided too little information to the broad public.\n\nIn contrast, a simpler, although hardly foolproof approach is the use of the\nleverage ratio as a measure of overall risk to an institution. Dirring tills crisis, the leverage\n\nratio has been the capital measure of choice, more often than any other capital measures.\nIf you looked at the investment banks, the ratios average somewhere around 30-to-l.\n\nEveryone understands that. When you look at banks, it is around 12-to-1, sometimes as\nhigh as 15-to-l. These ratios are straightforward and simple. If we set a range of\n\nstandards around that, I think they would be more enforceable. I don’t recall a single\ndiscussion of substance over the last several months about risk-based capital, and that is a\n\nhard truth.\n\nWhen you have boundaries that are clear, that set reasonable limits within which\n\nan institution must operate and they are enforceable by the primary supervisor. I think it\nbecomes more countercyclical. We know it will not eliminate the crisis, but it will\n\nmitigate the damage.\n\nFinally, let me end by suggesting a number of other issues that this crisis raises\nthat we will need to think about as we go forward:\n\n•\n\nAs the consolidations continue, we need to address the rising levels of\nconcentration of financial resources among a financial oligarchy that will\nwield vast powers in the future.\n\n•\n\nThe degree to which we accept too big to fail. If we do accept that, then the\n\npremiums that should be charged these favored institutions for that status.\n•\n\nThe oversight required of the entire industry of hedge and equity funds will\nhave to be addressed as this crisis proceeds.\n\n\f•\n\nThe appropriate degree to which the central banks of the world should extend\ntheir lending facilities to staunch financial crisis in the future.\n\n•\n\nThe level of guarantee the government might give to the assets of individuals\nwho place them in trust of private financial managers and institutions of any\nsize and import. That is extremely important as we work through this crisis\n\nand are making decisions today.\n•\n\nThe unintended consequences should be looked at in terms of moral hazard\nthat are introduced by extending government safety nets now globally.\n\n•\n\nWe also need a framework for how we resolve these issues. We need to put it\nhi place in advance of the next crisis so we can find a systematic way in the\nfuture.\n\nThere is much to do. We must use the tools we have to navigate these difficult\n\nwaters. The Treasury’s most recent capital program will be important to moving forward\n\nand how we implement it will determine its success.\nTin optimistic we’ll work through this crisis. Then, we need to turn to addressing\nthe very thorny issues this crisis has set in motion.\n\nThank you.\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFinancial Tunnoil: Its Effects on Developed and Emerging Economies\nA Money and Banking Conference at the Central Bank of Argentina\nBuenos Aires, Argentina\nSeptember 1, 2008\n\n\fIt is a pleasure to be in Buenos Aires today to participate in tins high-level conference\n\nsponsored by the Central Bank of Argentina. Revolutionary changes in financial markets,\ncombined with events such as the market disruptions associated with the subprime lending\n\ndebacle, have raised anew questions about the role of central banks in maintaining financial\nstability. Though central banks have traditionally had some responsibility for financial stability,\n\nsuch responsibility has typically not been placed on par with more explicit mandates for price\nstability and economic performance, hr part perhaps, because of the episodic nature of financial\n\ncrises. Yet, recent market disruptions in the United States make it very clear that the financial\nmarkets, the general public and political authorities will look first and foremost to the Federal\nReserve to respond to any significant threats to financial stability.\n\nIn this context, it may be useful to take a closer look at a central bank’s mandate for\n\nfinancial stability. Today, the Federal Reserve plays a role in “crisis prevention” through its\nregulation and prudential supervision of banks and bank holding companies. It also plays a role\n\nin “crisis management” by providing liquidity to stem financial disruptions and by using\nmonetary policy to reduce the impact of financial disturbances on economic activity. In the\n\ncurrent crisis, the Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented steps to manage and contain the\n\ncrisis. As we examine lessons learned front these events, we will have to decide whether\n\nfinancial stability can be best maintained in the future, as some have suggested, by extending the\nFederal Reserve’s supervisory and lending authority to a broader part of the financial system. In\n\ndoing so, we need to examine both the intended and possible unintended consequences of such a\ndecision. Alternatively, if we do not envision a broader role for the Federal Reserve, we need to\narticulate what other institutional reforms might be needed to avoid a repeat of the recent crisis\n\nand to reduce the crisis management burden on central banks going forward.\n\n1\n\n\fA second issue worthy of further discussion is how a central bank’s mandate for\n\nfinancial stability can be balanced with its other macroeconomic responsibilities. For the Federal\nReserve, adding a more explicit financial stability mandate to its existing dual mandate for price\nstability and economic growth raises important and difficult questions about the compatibility of\n\nthese responsibilities and the problems that might arise in attempting to achieve them all\nsimultaneously.\n\nLet me begin my remarks by examining more closely what is meant by “financial\n\nstability” and the Federal Reserve’s current role in maintaining financial stability. Then I will\nlook at the changing structure of the financial system, how the Federal Reserve has responded to\nthe current crisis and the issues surrounding the possible extension of the Federal Reserve’s\n\nresponsibilities. Finally, I will address some of the possible implications of a broadened\n\nfinancial stability mandate for the Federal Reserve’s other macroeconomic responsibilities.\nFinancial Stability and Systemic Risk\n\nAs we are all aware, a stable financial system is essential to a growing economy,\nparticularly in terms of providing a sound payments mechanism and efficient, sustainable credit\n\nintermediation. Since disruptions to this payments system or credit intermediation process will\n\ndirectly and adversely affect real economic activity, I believe that public policy has an important\nrole to play in mitigating these market breakdowns.\nOne aspect of public policy is to provide a resilient and rational framework within which\n\nfinancial institutions and markets can operate. History, however, suggests that some breakdowns\nwill inevitably occur within any dynamic financial system and economy. Consequently,\nmaintaining financial stability from a public policy perspective does not mean preventing all\n\nfinancial disruptions, but rather mitigating those market and institutional breakdowns that could\n\n2\n\n\fhave a significant impact on aggregate economic activity. A key implication from this\n\nperspective is that financial losses or the failure of an individual firm, even a large one, does not\nwarrant governmental intervention unless the outcome poses a substantial threat to the economy.\n\nThis public policy role is most clearly warranted itr addressing systemic risks to the\n\nfinancial system. Systemic risk can be broadly defined as the risk that problems at an individual\ninstitution or segment of the market would spread to a wider set of institutions and markets and\n\npose a major threat to economic activity. This type of contagion could occur because of the\narray of linkages that may exist among institutions and markets through counterparty, payments\n\nand other risk exposures. While counterparty exposures at large institutions have constituted the\ntraditional view of systemic risk, I would also extend the definition of systemic risk to include\n\ninstances where many institutions - and not just the largest - are exposed to a common set of\n\nadverse factors, such as during the real estate, energy and agricultural collapses in the United\nStates during the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nCommercial banks have long had a unique role in supporting the economy through their\ncredit intermediation activities and in connecting individuals and businesses to the payments\nsystem. These activities have placed banks at the center of policy concerns over systemic risk.\n\nHowever, given the growing role of capital markets and nonbank institutions in the\nintermediation process, we should begin to ask ourselves whether these broader market segments\n\npose systemic concerns that are independent from those already arising from their linkages to the\nbanking system.\n\nThe importance of maintaining financial stability and addressing systemic threats to the\neconomy justifies the federal safety net and the need for prudential supervision. We have a long\n\nhistory of using prudential or safety and soundness supervision of the banking system to limit the\n\n3\n\n\fpotential risks to this safety net. The premise behind this approach is that the health of the\n\nfinancial system can be solidified by monitoring and controlling the risks assumed by individual\nbanks and by requiring appropriate levels of capital and liquidity to support their operations. To\n\nthe extent these supervisory objectives can be met, the risk of serious failures and safety net\n\nlosses can be reduced. Our changing financial markets, though, are now prompting us to\nexamine how far this framework of prudential supervision and safety net protection can and\n\nshould be extended.\nThe Federal Reserve’s Current Role\n\nAs the central bank for the United States, the Federal Reserve has been assigned a critical\nrole in promoting financial stability and responding to financial crises. This role is inherent in\nmany of its powers hi eluding: banking supervision, the provision of liquidity through the\n\ndiscount window and open market operations, and payments system oversight.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s responsibilities for banking regulation and prudential supervision\nare largely aimed at preventing financial crises and protec ting the federal safety net.\n\nAccordingly, these efforts encompass capital adequacy standards for state member banks and\nholding companies, consolidated oversight of the risk exposures and risk management practices\n\nof these institutions, and corrective enforcement actions to deal with serious problems. The\n\nSystem’s responsibilities for supervising holding companies and state member banks also\nprovide valuable insights on the operation of individual institutions and banking markets.\n\nMoreover, with regard to crisis management, this supervisory experience and the information\n\nobtained in the supervisory process have been increasingly important in designing appropriate\nresponses to financial disruptions.\n\n4\n\n\fTo deal with or manage potential crises, the Federal Reserve also relies on its authority to\n\ninject liquidity into the financial system. Although other regulatory agencies also bear\nresponsibility for helping to ensure financial stability, the Federal Reserve’s authority to supply\n\nliquidity gives it a unique role during a financial crisis. This role represents a fundamental\npurpose behind the creation of the Federal Reserve System and the reason why the Federal\n\nReserve is expected to take the leading role in maintaining financial stability and mitigating\n\nbreakdowns in the financial markets.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may inject liquidity through open market operations. To provide\nliquidity in a more targeted manner, the Federal Reserve may lend through the discount window\nto any depositoiy institution and may also lend to any individual, partnership or corporation in\n\n“unusual and exigent circumstances.” These different ways to inject liquidity thus give the\n\nFederal Reserve a choice in how it will supply liquidity to institutions and the overall economy.\nThe New Financial Structure and the Broadening Mandate for Central Banks\n\nTraditionally, the Federal Reserve’s supervisory responsibilities and its financial stability\nconcerns have centered on commercial banks. Tills approach reflects the multifaceted role of\nbanks including: their responsibilities in the payments system, their participation in the credit\n\nintermediation process, and their role as a source of liquidity and acting as a counterparty in\nfinancial transactions.\nI think we would all agree, though, that the current market turmoil points out how much\n\nthe financial system has changed over the past several decades. Recent events illustrate that\n\nfinancial disruptions can arise from outside of the traditional banking channels, while taking on\nnew dimensions and features. As an example, many of the recent problems arose from\n\nmortgage-backed securitization activities that not only involved U.S. banking organizations, but\n\n5\n\n\falso brought in a complex mixture of other firms. Such firms have included investment banks,\nmortgage originators, credit rating agencies, mortgage servicers, securities issuers, asset\nmanagers, investors and financial institutions across many different countries.\n\nThis experience clearly indicates that more of the credit process is now taking place\n\noutside of the banking system and within a much broader global financial marketplace.\nInvestment banks, in particular, are an important segment in this expanding marketplace as they\n\ngo beyond their traditional focus on underwriting and distribution of securities and private\nplacement activities. Today, we can see that investment banks derive an increasing portion of\ntheir busmess from more sophisticated securities and derivatives activities, mortgage and\ncommercial lending, and the operation of thrift and industrial loan company subsidiaries.\n\nThe current financial crisis also shows the extensive and complex set of counterparty\n\nrisks to winch major institutions are now exposed and the difficulties such risks may pose in\nmaintaining market confidence and addressing problems at individual institutions, hr fact, the\n\ncollapse of Bear Steams provides a striking example of how the ramifications of a single\nnonbank firm’s troubles can extend throughout the financial system, threatening public\n\nconfidence and complicating any resolution efforts.\nThese developments thus raise a number of issues for managing financial crises. The\nsheer size of the financial markets, the many different counterparties and the interdependencies\n\namong participants suggest that significant disruptions from any portion of the market - bank or\nnonbank - could “freeze” financial transactions and activities and consequently harm the real\n\neconomy. Most notably, the growing role that capital markets and nonbank institutions play in\nthe financial intermediation process suggests that systemic concerns can arise independently or\n\nin conjunction with the linkages that already exist through the banking system.\n\n6\n\n\fTo deal with the financial breakdowns that have occurred in this expanded financial\nsystem, the Federal Reserve has taken several steps that are of a nearly unprecedented nature.\n\nThese include opening the discount window to primary dealers, taking in a wider range of\ncollateral on loans, lending $30 billion to support the takeover of Bear Stearns, and pledging\nbackup support to Faimie Mae and Freddie Mac. I would note that such steps are taking the\n\nFederal Reserve well beyond its traditional policy boundaries and are broadening its financial\nstability mandate to encompass much more than the banking system and its usual links to the\n\nfinancial marketplace and the overall economy.\nAn apt analogy would be to say that the recent market tunnoil has taken us to the other\nside of the river from where we have traditionally operated. Consequently, we must ask\n\nourselves if we should stop and stay where we are today, continue and go even farther into tills\nuncharted territory, or try to find a way to go back across the river to our previous and wellknown position.\n\nMore specifically, should the Federal Reserve, as well as other central banks facing the\nsame pressures, seek to formalize this broader role in financial stabilization? If so, a logical step\nin this process would be for central banks to take on whatever supervisory authority would seem\nnecessaiy for overseeing the entities operating in this expanding marketplace and for protecting a\n\nmuch wider safety net. Or, alternatively and after the current crisis abates, we could select a path\nthat would take us back to our traditional role and a more carefully defined and contained safety\nnet? Under this approach, many would take steps to strengthen or provide more inherent\n\nresiliency to those areas that have suffered the most from recent market breakdowns, which\nwould reflect the positive side of market discipline.\n\n7\n\n\fWhat course we choose is of critical importance to the future role of central banks and to\n\ntheir ability to maintain independence in formulating policy. I would like to explore these\n\nquestions next hi terms of two issues: the appropriate use of the federal safety net and the\nimplications for monetary policy under a broadening mandate.\nSafety Net Issues and Moral Hazard Concerns\n\nThe public policy actions directed toward Bear Stearns, primary dealers, and Fannie Mae\n\nand Freddie Mac have resulted in a significant expansion of the safety net and the Federal\nReserve’s lending practices. Now that more financial activities have gravitated outside of the\n\nbanking system, more financial stability concerns seem destined to arise. Our lending to support\nthe takeover of Bear Stearns and to provide liquidity to primary dealers, for example, has taken\n\nthe Federal Reserve well beyond its traditional approach of injecting discount window funds\n\nthrough the commercial banking system.\nTins new financial framework, consequently, leaves us with several distinct choices.\n\nSome, for instance, have suggested that we should extend more of a bank-like supervisory and\nregulatory framework over the major players hr this broader financial marketplace in return for\ntheir having access to the discount window and other possible forms of public assistance.\nOthers, though, believe that such oversight and safety net responsibilities could lead to a range of\n\nproblems and an even more fragile marketplace by compounding moral hazard problems and by\nreducing the role that market discipline could play in strengthening our financial markets and\n\nfostering innovation.\nIn general, most recognize that we must think carefully about permanently extending the\n\nfinancial safety net and the Federal Reserve’s lending responsibilities. Using the Federal\nReserve’s resources to address breakdowns within a broader financial marketplace will\n\n8\n\n\fnecessarily benefit the assisted institutions, and the particular market segments or financial\ninstruments associated with the problems. Also it is important to keep in mind that many other\nmarket participants who have made more prudent decisions will be left at a disadvantage by\n\nhaving to compete without such special favors. For the Federal Reserve and other public\n\nauthorities, such a role would thus involve a host of difficult decisions during a financial crisis\nand would potentially put the Federal Reserve in the position of having to pick the winners and\nlosers from a broad range of financial institutions and investors. Moreover, as the Bear Steams\n\nexperience shows, these decisions may have to be made in a hurry and with limited information\nin many cases, and any actions will likely raise questions about why some segments of the\n\neconomy are protected while others are not. This is a difficult position to find ourselves in and\n\nits consequences must be carefully weighed before we choose such a course of action.\nIn providing liquidity or other assistance to market participants who have made unwise\ndecisions, we risk magnifying the moral hazard problems in financial markets. These moral\n\nhazard problems will arise as any substantial public assistance works to undermine market\noutcomes and thereby reduce the incentives that institutions and investors have to manage risk\n\nand make sound choices. One need only look to the GSEs Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to\n\nwitness the effects such favored treatment has in the marketplace.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent example of moral hazard risks is the “too-big-to-fail”\nproblem associated with large commercial banks. As I have noted in prior speeches, this has\n\nproven to be a very intractable issue for banking regulators. We all recognize that extending\npublic safety nets, discount window lending and bank-like supervision to a much broader\nmarketplace risks creating a financial system of less inherent stability and an ever larger class of\n\n“too-big-to-fail” institutions. Over time it would involve making difficult decisions regarding\n\n9\n\n\fwhat segments of the broader financial system should be supervised, how extensively they\n\nshould be supervised, and whether this supervision would adequately protect the safety net in\n\nthis new environment.\nWhen we consider these consequences it becomes more apparent, to me at least, that we\nmust strive to limit public safety nets and minimize their associated moral hazard problems.\nThere are a number of policy steps we should consider to help markets function in a more\n\norderly fashion and become more resilient to financial crises. To return to my analogy, this\nmeans doubling back across the river to a more historical central banking role, and making clear\na future crossing would be rare. And we must accept that the credibility of such an assertion will\ndepend critically on how future crises are handled.\n\nIf we choose to double back, then we must also direct more supervisory focus to the\nmarket interdependencies among commercial banks, and we must institute better mechanisms to\nunwind failing nonbank financial institutions and their counterparty exposures. We should\n\ncontinue to pur sue initiatives with the private sector to increase market transparency, entrance\n\ncorporate governance mechanisms and market incentives, and strengthen settlement systems and\ntrading and securitization markets. And it should be clear that major nonbank financial\ninstitutions that seek discount window assistance will immediately come under Federal Reserve\noversight. This oversight would be directed toward ascertaining the viability and exposures of\n\nsuch institutions and controlling potential safety net losses.\n\nImplications of a Broadening Mandate for Central Banks\nFinally, let me now turn my remarks toward a discussion of the macroeconomic\nimplications of broadening the Federal Reserve’s traditional dual mandate for price stability and\nmaximum employment to include more explicit responsibilities for financial stability. The events\n\n10\n\n\fof the past year have been especially usefill in articulating the challenges that may arise in\n\nimplementing a tripartite mandate. I would like to focus on the following four questions as\nparticularly important to our understanding of how financial stability fits into a central bank’s\n\nportfolio of responsibilities.\n\nFirst, can we define a set of principles to guide a central bank’s mandate for financial\n\nstability? This is a key issue for a central bank in determining when it needs to take actions to\npreserve financial stability or, conversely, when it should refrain from doing so, particularly in\nsituations when political and industry pressures may be calling for a policy response. It is also\n\nessential if a central bank is to know when to unwind and remove policy accommodation or\nspecial liquidity measures. Defining the principles guiding our financial stability mandate is also\n\nimportant for central banks in communicating with the public and for formulating meaningfill\ndebates witinn the central bank.\nSecond, does a central bank have the ability to effectively pursue a tripartite mandate?\n\nThat is, does it have enough policy tools, and will these tools be effective in a financial crisis? I\nthink it is fair to say that, at the outset of the current crisis, central banks did not have practiced\n\nmechanisms in place to provide liquidity to the institutions and markets most in need of liquidity.\n\nOver the past year, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have shown considerable\nflexibility and ingenuity in addr essing these needs. It remains to be seen, of course, whether\n\nsome of these facilities will be made a more permanent part of the central bank’s policy toolkit.\nAt the same time, it is sometimes the case that the stimulus provided by lowering the\n\npolicy rate is less effective in a financial crisis because important parts of the policy transmission\n\nmechanism are dysfunctional. This difficulty was highlighted in the current crisis where the\nfinancial difficulties centered on housing, which is typically a key component of the transmission\n\n11\n\n\fmechanism. And, it was even more dramatically illustrated in the Japanese banking crisis a few\n\nyears ago where monetary policy was pushed to its limits with very little effect. As I have\nindicated on other occasions, care must be taken not to ask too much of monetary policy or we\n\nrisk adding significant inflationary pressures into an economy.\n\nThird, how does a central bank trade off potentially conflicting objectives under a\ntr ipartite mandate? Centr al banks, for instance, may have more to deal with than a financial\n\ncrisis. In the current situation, we have experienced a severe financial shock coupled with a\nsinge in global inflation. In the face of accelerating inflation, it is important that we not calibrate\npolicy principally to deal with the financial crisis if it involves compromising to an unreasonable\n\nextent our ability to achieve our mandate for price stability, hr the United States, core PCE\ninflation has been above most definitions of price stability for the past four years and is poised to\n\nmove even higher over the near term. The current stance of policy, while understandably\n\ncalibrated for responding to the immediate financial crisis, will make it difficult to achieve our\nmandate for price stability over the longer term.\n\nFinally, how can a central bank implement a financial stability mandate while\nmaintaining the independence needed to actively pursue its other mandates? As I noted earlier,\n\nin the midst of a financial crisis, a central bank will likely be encouraged to take actions that are\n\nfiscal in nature or that directly affect the allocation of credit by targeting assistance or liquidity to\nspecific institutions, markets or financial instruments. These actions necessarily affect\nexpectations for similar actions in the future and bring forward political pressures that confirm\n\nsuch expectations for the future, hi these circumstances, a central bank must be particularly\naware of the difficult trade-offs between its financial stability and price stability mandate,\n\n12\n\n\fespecially where, like the United States, the central bank does not have a formal objective for\nprice stability.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nLet rne conclude by emphasizing the broader applicability of the issues that I have\ndiscussed today. Although I have focused my remarks mainly on the Federal Reserve, I believe\nmany of the issues raised by this period of financial stress have important implications for other\ncentral banks as financial market liberalization and development proceed around the world.\n\nMaintaining financial stability in a changing financial system is a difficult task and, realistically,\n\nfinancial crises will occur in the future despite our best efforts to prevent them. Addressing these\nissues requires a delicate balance between markets and policy intervention and requires\n\nrecognition of the important macroeconomic implications for central banks. While there can be\nlittle doubt that central banks will continue to have responsibility for financial stability going\n\nforward, recent events raise important questions about how this mandate should be implemented.\n\nFinally, for a market economy to work best, it must to the maximum extent possible find\na balance between financial stability and a stable price environment and in doing so must be able\n\nto allow individual institutions to fail. The “Too Big to Fail” issue will only grow in importance\nas the consolidation of the financial industry grows in both size and scope in future decades.\n\n13\n\n\f"

            "content": "Challenging Times for the U.S. Economy\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nDurango, Colorado\nJuly 16, 2008\n\n\f2\n\nThank you. I am pleased to be in Durango today to talk with you about current\neconomic conditions and the prospects for the national economy and monetary policy in\n\nthe period ahead. As you know, the U.S. economy is in the midst of a very difficult\n\nperiod. Economic growth has slowed considerably, employment has declined and the\nunemployment rate has risen. Despite these developments, there remain some positive\nsigns in the economy and, with cunent fiscal and monetary policy actions, we may yet\n\navoid a recession. At the same time, however, higher oil, food, and commodity prices\nhave boosted inflation, undermining the economy and causing hardship for many\n\nhouseholds and businesses.\nhi this environment, monetaiy policy must walk a fine line: supporting growth,\n\nwhile ensuring that higher food and energy prices do not cause inflation expectations to\nbecome unanchored and lead to a more widespread inflation problem. While the cunent\n\naccommodative stance of monetaiy policy reduces the risk of recession, it almost\ncertainly raises the risk of higher inflation.\nIn the next few minutes I want to develop these points by providing my\n\nperspectives on current economic conditions, the outlook for the economy over the\nsecond half of the year, and the difficult challenges for monetaiy policy in the cunent\n\neconomic environment.\n\nCunent Economic Conditions\n\nOver the past two quarters, we have seen a significant slowing of economic\ngrowth. Real GDP growth was just .6 percent hi the final quarter of last year and\nimproved only slightly to 1 percent in the first quarter of this year. Second quarter\nestimates, which will be released at the end of this month, are likely to be somewhat\n\n\f3\n\nhigher, perhaps in the neighborhood of 2 percent. These numbers, while better than\nmany expected, still fall short of the economy’s estimated potential growth rate of\napproximately 2.5 percent.\n\nAs growth has slowed, we have seen rising layoffs and a higher unemployment\nrate. Over the first six months of this year, payroll employment growth has declined by\nover 400 thousand jobs, with the largest job losses in construction and manufachiring.\n\nFrom a low of 4.4 percent in March 2007, the unemployment rate has risen to 5.5 percent\ncurrently.\nThere are three primary factors behind this weaker growth. First, the slump in\n\nhousing construction, now in its third year, has taken almost a frill percentage point off\n\ngrowth over the past eight quarters. Second, higher energy prices have led to a marked\n\nslowing in consumer- spending, with purchases of autos especially affected. Third, the\nfinancial distress following the collapse of subprime mortgage lending has led banks and\nother financial intermediaries to restrict the availability of credit, not only for mortgage\n\nlending, but for other business and consumer lending.\nWith these negative factors, many economists and financial analysts believed a\nrecession was inevitable in the first half of this year. However, a recession has not\nmaterialized because of strengths in other parts of the economy which have helped\nsustain growth, hi particular, with the sizable decline in the dollar over the past few\n\nyears, U.S.-made goods have become more competitive, and we have seen a boom in\nU.S. exports, hi addition, federal defense spending and state and local government\n\nspending have continued to provide a boost to growth and employment. The Federal\nReserve also has taken significant steps to limit the economic slowdown by providing\n\n\f4\nincreased liquidity to financial institutions affected by the subprime crisis and by\n\nlowering the federal fluids rate target to its current level of 2 percent.\nComplicating this picture has been the fact that as we have eased policy to counter\nthe slowing economic growth, we have seen inflationary pressures rise. Price increases\n\nin energy, food and many industrial commodities are accelerating. Oil prices have more\nthan doubled over the past two years, and food price inflation is tire highest in many\n\nyears. Overall inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator,\n\nhas increased by 3.1 percent over the past year. Core PCE, which looks at the prices of\nnon-energy and non-food goods and seivices, has increased a more modest 2.1 percent\nover the past year. But, price pressures appear to be building. Indeed, business and\n\nhousehold surveys indicate rising inflationary expectations over the near term, a\ndevelopment that bears close scrutiny over the next several months.\n\nThe Near-Term Outlook\nTurning from where we are to the near-term outlook, I expect only modest\n\nimprovement in the second half of this year, with GDP growth in a range of 1 to 1.5\npercent. Growth will be supported over this period by the fiscal stimulus from the tax\n\nrebates, from further strength in exports and government spending, and horn the current\naccommodative stance of monetary policy. Indeed, growth is likely to be relatively\n\nstrong in the third quarter because of the rebates and then may soften noticeably in the\n\nfourth quarter.\nHousing will continue to be a drag on growth for the balance of this year and into\n2009. Inventories of new and existing homes remain very high in many parts of the\n\n\f5\n\ncountry, which will put additional pressure on home prices and dampen new housing\n\nconstruction. In addition, higher mortgage rates and reduced credit availability are likely\n\nto impede a housing recovery. Still, there are some very tentative signs of improvement\nin existing home sales, and my expectation is that housing will be less of a drag on\n\ngrowth as we move through 2009.\n\nTwo other factors limiting second half growth are the ongoing strength in energy\n\nprices and continuing restrictions on credit availability. High oil and gasoline prices are\ncontinuing to sap consumer spending, forcing households to cut back spending on\ndiscretionary items and especially autos. There has been a sharp decline in sales of new\n\nautos, especially SUVs and light trucks, which is likely to continue unless there is a\ndramatic reversal in oil prices.\nCredit availability also is likely to restrain growth in the near term. Going\n\nforward, the fallout from the subprime debacle is likely to lessen as the institutions\ninvolved hi securitization of mortgages and other asset-backed securities move to clean\n\nup their balance sheets and raise new capital. However, as the economy has slowed, Ioan\ndelinquencies on other types of loans have increased, and banks are restricting credit and\n\nraising the price of credit to many of their customers.\n\nPutting the positive and negative factors together, I think that we are likely to see\npositive but subdued growth over the balance of the year. Strength in exports and\ngovernment spending, the tax rebates, and a reduced drag from housing should help\n\ncounter the effects of higher energy prices and financial stress. While I believe we can\navoid a recession. I recognize that there are significant risks that growth could turn out\n\nweaker than I suggest here.\n\n\f6\n\nI am, disappointedly, even less optimistic about the inflation outlook over second\nhalf of the year. Indeed, I expect both overall and core inflation measures to rise further\n\nover the next several months. The most recent surge in energy prices that began in May\n\nhas not yet been fully reflected in inflation measures. Moreover, my sense in talking to\nmany businesses is that it has become much more difficult for businesses to hold the line\non prices generally as energy and other materials prices continue to climb. And, with\n\nrising import prices, especially from China, businesses are finding that they have more\npricing power than in recent years.\n\nWhile I have been encouraged by the small pass through of food and energy\nprices to core inflation thus far, I am worried that this pattern could change quickly. As I\nnoted earlier, short-term inflation expectations have moved higher over the past few\n\nmonths. Over time, if an inflation psychology becomes embedded in household and\n\nbusiness behavior, this current rise in food and energy prices could lead to a much more\n\npersistent inflation problem.\nChallenges for Monetary Policy\n\nLet me close with my perspectives on the challenges facing monetaiy policy in\nthe period ahead. As you know, over the past year the Federal Reserve has responded\n\naggressively to the financial market disruptions associated with the subprime mortgage\ncrisis. It put into place a number of liquidity facilities to improve the functioning of\n\nfinancial markets, and it lowered the federal funds rate from 5 V* percent to 2 percent to\nhelp cushion the broader economy from these disruptions.\n\nThe continuing rise in energy and food prices over the past several months has\nmade the current monetary policy environment considerably more challenging, however.\n\n\f7\n\nWhile a 2 percent federal funds rate may be appropriate in a period of extr eme economic\nweakness, if maintained for too long it could allow inflationary pressures to build over\ntime.\nYou may recall the last time we had very large increases in energy and food\n\nprices was in the 1970s, and these increases contributed to the rise in inflation rates to\n\ndouble-digit levels in the late 1970s. You will notice that I said “contributed” - not\n“caused”. Increases in food, energy and other commodity prices can cause a temporary\n\nincrease in inflation but cannot cause a permanent increase. Indeed, markets work, and\ncommodity price increases invariably lead to reduced demand and increased supply of the\n\ncommodities that cause their prices to decline.\nCommodity price increases can contribute to a more long-la sting inflation\n\nproblem, however, if they occur in the context of an accommodative monetary policy that\n\nallows these increases to pass through into the prices of other goods and services, and\ninto higher wages. Tins pass through is more likely when money policy remains\naccommodative for an extended period, and inflationary psychology becomes entrenched\nin consumer and business behavior and every price increase leads to expectations of\n\nfurther increases.\nIf we look back to the 1970s, the reason food and energy price increases had such\na large effect was that inflation had become entrenched in the economy. Inflation\n\nexpectations had become unanchored because monetary policy had been too\naccommodative and had kept interest rates too low for too long in an attempt to stimulate\n\neconomic growth. Indeed, inflation had risen to more than 5 percent in the late 1960s and\n\n\f8\n\nearly 1970s, and the Nixon administration had made an unsuccessful attempt to bring\ninflation down through wage and price controls even before the first oil price shock.\n\nWhile the comparison to the ’70s can be useful, the present economic situation is\nalso different from that period. The current increases in commodity prices are occurring\nin an environment in which inflation has been low and inflation expectations have been\n\nbetter anchored. However, like the 1970s, monetary policy is currently accommodative,\nnot only in the United States but in many other countries around the world. In this\n\nenvironment, there is a significant risk that inflation and inflation expectations could\nmove higher in coming months. Thus, it will be important for the Federal Reserve to\nmonitor inflation developments and inflation expectations closely, and to move to a less\n\naccommodative stance in a timely fashion. When to begin the process, and how fast to\n\nmove, will be difficult decisions for the Federal Open Market Committee in the period\nahead. I can assure you, however, that the Federal Reserve takes both parts of its “dual\nmandate” seriously and will walk that fine line to maintain stable economic activity and\n\nlow inflation.\n\nThank you, that concludes my prepared remarks, and I would be happy to respond\nto your questions.\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nEconomic Club of Colorado\nDenver, Colorado\nMay 6, 2008\n\n\f2\n\nI am pleased to be in Denver and I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you\nabout current economic and financial market developments. As you know, the past eight\n\nmonths have been a very difficult period for the U.S. economy. A sharp slowdown in\n\ngrowth has put the economy at the brink of a recession while, at the same time, rising\ncommodity prices have caused inflation pressures to rise considerably. And, to make\nmatters worse, these events have occurred against the backdrop of a collapse in housing\n\nmarkets that has shaken financial markets around the world.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has responded to these developments aggressively. It has\ntaken unprecedented actions to provide increased liquidity to banks and other financial\nmarket participants to maintain the functioning of financial markets. And, it has eased\n\nmonetary policy considerably to try to ensure that the disruptions in financial markets do\n\nnot spread to the broader economy.\n\nDespite current difficulties, in my view there is room for optimism about the near­\nterm outlook for the U.S. economy. Financial markets appear to have stabilized somewhat,\n\nand the economy should pick up in the second half of the year as fiscal and monetary\nstimulus take hold. The damage to financial markets is severe, however, and it is likely to\n\nbe some time before they are able to function normally. Indeed, I believe that major\nchanges in industry practices and a significant rethinking of financial regulation will be\nrequired if we are to avoid similar problems in the future.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nTo begin, then, over the past two quarters, economic growth has slowed\n\nconsiderably. Real GDP growth was only 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, and\nthe fir st estimate of first-quarter growth, released last week, was again only .6 percent.\n\n\f3\n\nAs the economy has slowed, we have seen a decline in employment and an\nincrease in the unemployment rate. During the first quarter, nonfarm payroll employment\n\nfell by almost 240,000, with most of the job losses in construction and manufacturing.\nAnd, over the past year, the national unemployment rate has risen from 4.4 percent to 5.0\n\npercent.\nMost of the current economic weakness can be attributed to two factors: the\nongoing slump in residential construction activity and the effects of higher energy prices on\n\nconsumer and bushiess spending. Over the past two years, housing activity has plummeted\n\nas rising defaults on subprime and other adjustable-rate loans have led to a severe decline\n\nin sales of new and existing homes. With rising inventories of unsold homes, new housing\nconstruction has collapsed in many parts of the country, and house prices have declined for\nthe first time in many years. Ure slump in new home construction has had a large effect on\nGDP growth, lowering growth by an average of 1 percent over the past two years.\nIn addition, rising energy prices have sapped consumer and business spending.\nBecause so much of our oil is imported, an increase in oil prices effectively acts as a tax on\n\nconsumer and business spending. Economists estimate that a sustained increase of $10 per\n\nbarrel in oil prices leads to a decline in GDP growth of .2 to .5 percentage points per year\nfor two years. Since oil prices have risen from $55 per barrel hi January 2007 to more than\n\n$115 per barrel recently, their economic impact has likely been to take at least another frill\npercentage point off of GDP growth.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned the potential impact of the recent financial market disruptions\non growth. Indeed, concern with the effects of these disruptions and, in particular, the\n\npossibility they could lead to a severe credit contraction was the principal motivation for\n\n\f4\n\nthe aggressive easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve over the past several\n\nmonths. As you know, since September, the federal funds rate target has been reduced\n\nfrom 5C percent to 2 percent. Although credit conditions have tightened considerably in\nrecent months and some markets for asset-backed securities have shut down, we have not\nseen as large a credit crunch as some anticipated. Indeed, outside of some mortgage\n\nmarkets, consumers and businesses with strong credit histories have continued to have\naccess to credit on reasonable tenns. Consequently, in my opinion, financial markets\n\ndisruptions, while noteworthy, are not the major story behind the recent weakness in\neconomic activity. Energy price increases and housing dominate this slowdown.\nAnother troublesome fact is that accompanying the recent slowing of growth has\n\nbeen renewed inflationary pressures. Prices for energy, food and other commodities have\n\nsoared over the past year. Overall CPI inflation has risen 4 percent from March 2007 to\nMarch 2008 and core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 2.4\n\npercent over the same period. It may seem somewhat strange for inflation to be at these\nlevels even as the economy is slowing, but the inflationaiy pressures are not primarily due\nto domestic factors. In fact, we are seeing significant increases in world commodity prices\n\nand prices for imported goods, including goods imported from China. Paid of these\n\nincreases is due to strong economic conditions abroad, but part is likely due to the sizeable\ndecline in the U.S. dollar over the past several years.\nSome would dismiss these rising inflationaiy pressures as temporary. I believe\nthey are more serious. Energy prices have been trending up for the past five years, and\nthere are good reasons for thinking that higher food and commodity prices are not being\nentirely driven by temporary supply and demand imbalances. However, the bigger concern\n\n\f5\n\nis that these increases are beginning to generate an inflation psychology to an extent that I\nhave not seen since the 1970s and early 1980s. Measures of inflation expectations in\n\nsurveys and financial markets are moving higher, and businesses are increasingly passing\non higher input and commodity prices to consumers and business customers. In this\n\nenvironment, in my opinion, there is a significant risk that higher inflation will become\n\nembedded in the economy and require significant monetary policy tightening to reduce it.\nTurning to the outlook, as I mentioned earlier, there are reasons that suggest the\neconomic slowdown will be short-lived. Part of the pickup in growth will likely come\n\nfrom the tax cuts that are going into effect currently, part from the monetary policy\nstimulus provided by low interest rates and pail from a boost to exports from the lower\ndollar. Forecasters also see moderation in energy and food costs later this year, which\n\nwould provide a boost to growth but also lead to lower inflation pressures.\n\nAs I indicated earlier, we are also seeing signs of stabilization in financial\n\nmarkets, with improved liquidity and more transactions. Still, many markets are not\nfunctioning normally, and it will take additional time for the damage to be assessed and\n\nrepaired.\n\nAs to monetary policy, the current accommodative stance should be sufficient to\ncushion the economy from a deeper slowdown and the risks that financial disruptions\ncould spill over to the broader economy. As the economy recovers and credit conditions\nimprove, however, it will be necessary for the Federal Reserve to remove the policy\n\naccommodation in a timely manner. How fast this occurs will depend on whether\ninflation pressures moderate or intensify in the period ahead.\n\n\f6\n\nThe Financial Crisis and the Federal Reserve’s Response\nLet me turn now to a more detailed discussion of the disruptions in financial\nmarkets that have occurred over the past several months and the Federal Reserve’s\nresponse to these events. It is a simple fact of history that, over a business cycle, markets\n\ntend toward excess optimism in which risk is seriously underestimated. In some cases,\n\npublic policy is required to “bail out” undeserving parties so as to minimize the broader\n\nimpact on the economy. It is also a fact that no matter the source of the financial\nproblem, no matter the size of the institution or the region in which the problem emerges,\n\nthe Federal Reserve will be part of any solution that is developed. This was the case in\nthe ’70s, ’80s and ’90s during the foreign debt, farm, real estate and energy crises and is\nthe case today. As a necessary principal party in prudential supervision and as the lender\n\nof last resort, the Federal Reserve is best positioned for this task.\nMost in this room are by now well aware of the role that subprime lending played\nin the creation of the housing bubble and its collapse. However, the problems in the\nfinancial system are much broader and deeper than subprime lending. Over the past\n\nseveral years, we have seen the emergence of easy credit availability, new complex\nfinancial instruments and reduced credit standards by many financial institutions. This\nleft the U.S. financial system dangerously exposed to an economic or financial shock that\ncould cause widespread defaults and erosion of asset values. Rising subprime\n\ndelinquencies provided the spark that started the financial conflagration, but there was a\nlot of dry tinder to spread the fire and an absence of firewalls and a sprinkler system to\n\ncontain the blaze.\n\n\f7\nIn recent years, subprime mortgages, like other mortgages, have been packaged\n\ninto mortgage-backed securities, and these securities then served as collateral for more\ncomplex asset-backed securities. When subprime delinquencies rose unexpectedly last\n\nsummer, investors in many types of asset-backed securities fled these markets, causing\nsevere valuation declines and losses to the holders of these securities. Although banks\ndid not make many of the original subprime loans, they held many of the affected\n\nsecurities and made loans to other institutions that created and held these securities.\n\nWhat resulted was a tremendous liquidity squeeze for the banking system and financial\nmarkets as well as large losses as the value of mortgage and other asset-backed securities\ndeclined. These strains were felt not only hi the United States but also in Europe,\n\nCanada, and some other countries where banks and other financial institutions had also\ninvested hi U.S. mortgage and asset-backed securities.\n\nTo meet panic demands for liquidity, the Federal Reseive and central banks in a\nnumber of other countries have taken extraordinary steps to maintain the functioning of\nthe financial system. In the Uihted States the Federal Reseive has made funds available\n\nto banks and other depository institutions through its discount window and has lowered\nthe cost of these funds. It has created a new discount window program, the Tenn Auction\nFacility, to provide additional funds to depository institutions at a market-determined\n\nrate.\n\nThe Federal Reseive also has taken a series of unprecedented actions to provide\nsupport to financial markets more generally. For example, it has broadened the range of\ncollateral hi its open market operations and security lending program. More recently, it\n\nhas created a new discount window facility for the banks and investment banks that\n\n\f8\n\noperate as primary dealers. These institutions play a key role in the Treasury securities\nmarket, and their health is important for the Federal Reserve’s ability to conduct\n\nmonetary policy through open market operations and for Treasury debt management\n\noperations. And, the Federal Reserve recently chose to provide direct support to Bear\n\nSteams, a primary dealer, to facilitate its purchase.\nAs I indicated earlier, financial markets have stabilized recently, in part because\n\nof the Federal Reserve’s timely actions. However, many of these actions were short-term\nin nature, and it is important that more permanent approaches be developed so that a\n\nsimilar crisis does not happen again. In my remaining time, I will discuss the longer-term\napproaches necessary to restoring and maintaining financial stability.\nSteps Toward Financial and Regulatory Reform\n\nThe current financial crisis has revealed weaknesses both in the private\nmechanisms that financial markets employ to provide internal discipline and in our\nsystem of financial regulation and oversight. From the standpoint of private market\n\ndiscipline, this crisis has provided the first major test of securitization, complex financial\n\ninstruments, risk modeling, and our new and broader market structure. Recent events\nindicate dismal test results: Many financial institutions and investors did not adequately\njudge, price or control the risks they assumed and did not prepare well for changing\nfinancial conditions. All of this occurred despite the wide array of new financial\n\ninstruments for hedging risks and the substantial advances many market participants\nclaimed to have made in their risk management processes.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, existing policies and supervisory oversight came\nup short in several areas, most notably in identifying and addressing the exposures\n\n\f9\n\ninstitutions had in certain off-balance-sheet activities and in their mortgage lending and\nsecuritization activities. These exposures, along with shortcomings in bank risk\n\nmanagement systems, led to inadequate capital and liquidity levels and to inaccurate\n\ndisclosures of risk positions to investors. Other complaints about the regulatory\nframework have included its failure to prevent fraudulent and abusive practices in some\nareas of the subprime market.\nOne other important regulatory concern is that many of the steps public\n\nauthorities have taken over the last year to stabilize the financial system seem likely to\n\nweaken market discipline and extend moral hazard problems to a much wider financial\nmarketplace. A key example of this, the recent sale of Bear Stearns, seems to indicate\n\nthat in a crisis situation, public authorities will not be in a position to let market discipline\nplay out when larger financial institutions encounter problems. Bear Stearns’ collapse\nindicates that such phrases as “systemically important” and “too-big-to-fail” can even be\n\napplied to investment banks below the top tier.\n\nThe danger from a public policy perspective is that a much broader group of\nmanagers and creditors may now believe and act as if they have an added layer of\n\nprotection from the risks they pursue. Beyond “too-big-to-fail” concerns, other market\n\ndiscipline and moral hazard problems may be inherent in some of the recent and more\nexpansive proposals to support housing markets and in the actions the Federal Reserve\n\nhad to take to provide liquidity to the market and expand discount window access.\nAll of these questions about our financial system are eliciting many suggestions\n\nfor reform. Some have suggested that we should turn back the clock when it comes to\nour efforts to deregulate financial markets, and others are suggesting significant changes\n\n\f10\nin the regulatory structure. However, I believe a more fundamental issue is at the heart of\nour problems and should remain the focus of our efforts: How can we strike an\n\nappropriate balance between risk and return in our financial marketplace, while\ndeveloping the public policy steps necessary to support this framework and promote\n\nfinancial stability?\nIn a longer-run context, we have two basic means by which to strengthen and\n\nreform our financial system: promote more effective market discipline and implement an\nimproved and more countercyclical regulatoiy framework.\n\nSteps toward more effective market discipline\n\nFor our financial markets to work well, market participants must serve as a strong\ndisciplinary force in rewarding successful venhires and curtailing funding for nonviable\n\nprojects and investments. However, as shown by the current crisis, market discipline\nfailed to prevent an overexpansion in the markets for mortgage finance and allowed a\n\nsignificant mispricing of the underlying risks.\n\nSome of the factors that contributed to this market breakdown include the\nemergence of extremely complex and hard-to-understand financial instruments,\nshortcomings in regulatoiy oversight and poor disclosures, financial conflicts of interest,\nand shortcomings in corporate governance. For instance, evaluating the more complex\nmortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations taxed the abilities of most\ninvestors. These investors were then left to rely on the credit assessments of loan\n\noriginators, rating agencies, traders, and the managers of hedge funds and other investor\nvehicles, most of whom had competing financial incentives. Of course, the perennial\n\nfactor in boom-and-bust cycles - greed-induced myopia - also played a central role as\n\n\fmany market participants assumed that we could not have a nationwide decline in\n\nhousing prices and that a continuous flow of hinds would be available.\nWhat steps should market participants take to restore their disciplinary role in the\n\nfinancial system and prevent the depth of problems we have recently experienced? In the\nnear term, investors can be expected to show a preference for simpler and more readily\nunderstood financial instruments, while showing a reluctance to put their money in the\n\ntypes of markets and investment vehicles that have caused much of the recent turmoil.\nThey can also be expected to exert more “due diligence” and to favor the originators,\nrating agencies and hind managers that demonstrate a reputation for providing sound\n\ncredit analysis and accurate disclosures. These are certainly some of the most apparent\n“lessons to be learned,” and it will take some time for our financial markets to regain the\nconfidence of investors and meet this revised set of expectations.\n\nExperience tells us, however, that as time passes and memories fade, market\n\nparticipants will always be tempted to relax their ongoing disciplinary role, particularly\nas any corrective steps begin to appear outmoded in a more prosperous time and as new\n\nand seemingly more profitable opportunities and investment vehicles are developed. For\nmarket discipline to be most effective over an entire cycle, it will thus be important for\n\ninvestors and institutions to work to establish a more resilient financial framework.\nSome key areas for market participants to work on are: improving financial\n\ndisclosure practices and developing risk management processes and models that reflect a\nfull range of economic experiences. Other needed reforms include establishing stronger\ncorporate governance steps - including a better set of incentives for financial agents to\n\n\f12\nreduce the conflicts of interest they now face - and fostering better control of liquidity\n\nrisk, clearing and settlement risks, and counterparty risk.\n\nA stronger, more countercyclical regulatory framework\nWeaknesses in our regulatory system revealed by the current financial crisis also\nrequire carefill thought and action. This crisis, hi fact, is raising questions about such\ntraditional supervisory issues as bank liquidity analysis, capital standards, risk\n\nmanagement practices and off-balance-sheet exposures. Because many financial\n\nactivities are gravitating beyond the banking system and into less-regulated capital\n\nmarkets, questions about the scope of regulation and how it can best support market\ndiscipline must be addressed.\nOne area where a number of large banking organizations and securities firms have\n\nfallen short is in the amount of capital they were holding against their risk exposures. It\nis clear that many organizations underestimated such risks and, accordingly, the amount\n\nof capital they would need. This was particularly hue for a number of new off-balance­\nsheet activities of larger banking organizations. With the transition to Basel II\n\ninternational capital standards for large banks and the reliance this system will place on\nbank internal risk models, it is particularly important that we make sure this approach\n\naddresses the type of problems recently encountered.\n\nIn this regard, I have a number of concerns and believe we need to be cautious as\nwe implement the new standards. First, banks have had a fairly short history with their\nrisk models and much of the data going into these models reflects only the period of\n\nprosperity before recent events. In fact, tests run on these models over the past few years\nhave suggested that most large banks could safely reduce the amount of capital they hold\n\n\f13\n\n- a premise which has now been shown to be overly optimistic, hi addition, recent\ncapital problems for larger banking associations were tied, in part, to their off-balance­\nsheet operations, and it is not clear whether Basel II will address these practices, as well\nas future banking innovations, any better than Basel I.\n\nA final concern is that Basel II has the potential to be procyclical as bankers\n\nupdate their risk models to reflect new events. Consequently, if we want banks to have\nthe capital to withstand future crises, I believe it is important for our capital standards to\n\nincorporate a longer-term view of risk and for banks to maintain a base of capital or a\n\nleverage ratio sufficient to support all their operations. A countercyclical, rules-based\napproach to control leverage is needed. It must be simple and observable and, thereby,\n\nenforceable.\nLiquidity has been another problem for many institutions, particularly with\n\nbreakdowns in the commercial paper and other funding markets, difficulties in valuing\nasset-backed securities and other investment vehicles, maturity mismatch problems, and\n\nquestions about the financial condition of some institutions. As I mentioned previously,\nthe Federal Reserve has taken a number of new approaches through the disco tint window\n\nto address these liquidity issues. We will certainly reevaluate these steps in the near\nfuture and decide what worked and whether such innovations as the liquidity facility\nshould be continued.\n\nWe will also have to take a carefill look at the moral hazard issues that might have\n\nbeen created by the expansion in discount window access and consider what we can do to\nchange such perceptions. Other suggestions for reforming the discount window have also\n\nbeen made, such as converting some of the lending to a “line of credit” format, under\n\n\f14\n\nwhich institutions could pay a fee for standby access to the window. It is also of critical\nimportance for banking and other financial supervisors to review and strengthen their\npolicies on liquidity; otherwise we will face many of the same problems in the future.\n\nBecause many of our current financial problems can be tied to asset-backed\nsecurities, beginning with the subprime market, we should ask ourselves what can be\ndone to strengthen the regulatory framework surrounding securitization and to address\nthe asymmetric information problems in this market. This is a particularly important\n\nquestion given the benefits that securitization can bring to our credit markets in terms of\n\nattracting new funding sources and distributing risk across a broader marketplace.\nAmong the ideas now being suggested are: (1) tighter registration requirements\n\nfor loan originators; (2) improved disclosures by originators and securitizers on the\nunderlying loans; (3) new limits on the types of asset-backed securities regulated\n\ninstitutions can hold; (4) greater liability, risk exposure or equity positions for originators\n\nand securitizers; and (5) new regulations for the agencies rating these securities.\nOther regulatory steps may be necessary. For example, some have questioned\n\nwhether the regulatory framework has kept up with the movement of securities films into\na broader range of activities. Where such firms once concentrated on brokerage and\n\nunderwriting activities, the recent market collapse has shown that the most significant\nrisks securities firms face are now in other areas. In regard to subprime lending\n\nregulation, the Federal Reserve has proposed a number of regulatory changes under\nRegulation Z and the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act to provide greater\n\nprotection to consumers and to eliminate certain deceptive or abusive practices on higherpriced mortgage loans. These amendments would also extend other protections to all\n\n\f15\n\nmortgage loans, including additional disclosures when lenders advertise loan rates and\nfeatures.\nA final and very important regulatoiy issue is what we do with firms that might be\nconsidered “too-big-to-fail.” With a growing number of large firms linked to each other\n\nthrough clearing and settlement systems, capital markets activities, and counterparty\nrisks, it is becoming more difficult to avoid supporting such entities during crisis periods.\nIn fact, we are rapidly creating an environment hi which the investors, creditors and\nmanagers at such institutions take it for granted that they will have this added measure of\n\nprotection when taking risk.\nThere are no easy answers in dealing with this “too-big-to-fail” issue, but we need\n\nto take some strong steps if we are to restore the proper balance between financial risk\nand return and make market discipline effective. But we must be certain that whenever a\n\nbailout cannot be avoided, it should follow also that public authorities assume senior\npositions with respect to stockholders and other creditors at these “too-big-to-fail”\n\ninstitutions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, as the nation's central bank, has responsibility and\naccountability for overall financial stability. It has been given the tools of authority hi\n\nmonetary policy, and regulatoiy and payments system oversight in a decentralized\nstructure insulated from politics to achieve its mission. Doing what must be done to\n\nfacilitate financial stability has always been the independent Federal Reserve System's\nrole. It will be difficult. One has to look no further than recent news media headlines\nabout the strong opposition to the proposed regulatoiy changes hi the mortgage industry\nthat I just mentioned to know this is true. But this environment is not much different\n\n\f16\ntoday than at the Federal Reserve's founding. Thus, as we take on these new challenges,\n\nI'll leave you with this quote from 1930 to illustrate my point. It is from Paul Warburg,\n\nwho was appointed a member of the first Federal Reserve Board by President Woodrow\nWilson.\n\"hi a country whose idol is prosperity, any attempt to tamper with conditions in\n\nwhich easy profits are made and people are happy, is strongly resented. It is a\ndesperately unpopular undertaking to dare to sound a discordant note of warning in an\n\natmosphere of cheer, even though one might be able to forecast with certainty that the\n\nice, on which the mad dance was going on, was bound to break. Even if one succeeded\nin driving the frolicking crowd ashore before the ice cracked, there would have been\n\nprotests that the cover was strong enough and that no disaster would have occurred if\nonly the situation had been left alone.\"1\nThere are many challenges ahead, many choices to make. Some I suspect will be\n\ndesperately unpopular.\n\n1 Paul M.

Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\n2008 Institute of International Finance Membership Meeting\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil\nMarch 5,2008\n\n\f2\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here today to speak at this forum on regulatory and industry\n\napproaches for dealing with recent market strains. Even as the current financial crisis in\nsubprime lending and structured products continues to unfold, we should be turning our\nattention to what changes in financial market structure and regulation may be appropriate\n\nto prevent a repeat of this type of crisis in the firurre.\n\nLet me begin with a point that is obvious but that has very significant implications\nfor how we should proceed in the future. The point is that while the current crisis\noriginated hi a small part of the financial system - the subprime mortgage market - it has\n\nrevealed some very large deficiencies in the functioning of the overall financial system.\nThus, solutions to the problem need to go far beyond repairing the subprime market and\nare likely to require sweeping changes in the business methods of financial institutions as\n\nwell as hi prudential supervision and regulation. My own views on how we should\nproceed are likely to differ from many of you in this room, but I hope that they may help\nsharpen the debate as we move forward.\nIt may be help fill to start with a brief summary of my main points. As I look at\n\nthe current crisis and other financial crises irr recent years, I am struck by the heavy\n\nburden that has been placed on monetary policy to cope with the crisis and its potential\nspillover effects to the broader economy. As someone who has been active in both the\n\nmonetary policy and supervisory spheres, I have come to the view that we are placing too\n\nmuch burden on monetary policy in dealing with financial crises. Thus, going forward,\n\nwe need to focus more attention on measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of\nfinancial crises, and we need to place more emphasis on other macro policy options to\n\n\f3\n\ndeal with the economic consequences of these crises. In addition, while I am very\nsupportive of industry efforts, including the IIF initiatives, to improve market practices, I\nremain skeptical that markets and market participants can be counted on to solve these\n\nproblems without an important role for prudential supervision and regulation. At the\n\nsame time, I understand that there are no simple solutions given tire need to strike a\nproper balance between financial innovation and financial stability across a range of\n\ndifferent financial institutions that operate in an increasingly global financial marketplace.\nCentral banks’ roles in financial stability\n\nLet me start with some thoughts about the roles that central banks play in\nfinancial stability. As the current crisis has evolved, central banks have provided\nsubstantial amounts of funds to the banking system to meet the heightened liquidity\n\ndemands of individual institutions, and some have also adjusted the stance of monetary\n\npolicy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been especially active on both fronts. Early on, it\nbecame clear that liquidity demands in this crisis differed in significant ways from\n\nprevious crises, and that established lending facilities were not adequately addressing the\nproblems. Both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank developed creative\nways of dealing with the liquidity pressures including, using greater flexibility in the\n\nconduct of open market operations; modifications to existing lending facilities; and the\nauctioning of term credit by the Federal Reserve, ECB, Swiss National Bank, and the\n\nBank of England. Indeed, I believe we need to consider whether some of the changes\nthat the Federal Reserve has implemented, such as the Tenn Auction Facility, should be\nmade permanent. Of course, this will require a more thorough assessment of the\n\n\f4\n\neffectiveness of these programs and possible longer-term ramifications on bank and\n\nfinancial market behavior.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has also adjusted the stance of monetary policy significantly\nto limit the potential spillover of these financial disturbances to the broader economy. In\n\nfact, the reduction in the federal funds rate target from 5 % percent in early September\nlast year to 3 percent today is quantitatively similar to the aggressive easing of policy in\nthe first half of 2001. As you know, policy was also eased in a number of previous\n\nfinancial crises in which there was concern that there might be significant effects on the\nbroader economy. These episodes include the 1987 stock market crisis, the banking\n\ncredit crunch in the early 1990s, and the LTCM/Russian debt default crisis in 1998.\n\nWhile monetary policy can play a key role in responding to a financial crisis, my\n\nown view is that we should be cautious in our expectations of what monetaiy policy can\naccomplish and consider some of the longer run consequences of excessive reliance on\nmonetary policy. This is especially true when policy is eased a lot and easier policy\n\nremains in place for an extended period of time.\nOne of the principal advantages of monetaiy policy as compared, say, to fiscal\n\npolicy is that monetaiy policy can react quickly. Even with the surprising speed that a\n\nU.S. fiscal stimulus package was enacted in this crisis, and even with the longer\ntransmission lags of monetaiy policy, monetaiy stimulus will be affecting the economy\n\nlong before the fiscal stimulus comes into force.\nHowever, monetaiy policy also has some significant limitations that. I believe,\n\nshould lead us to question how much we should rely on it when dealing with financial\n\ncrises. First, there may be a build up of inflation pressures if monetaiy policy remains\n\n\f5\n\ntoo easy for too long. As I noted earlier, an advantage of monetary policy is how fast it\n\ncan be put into effect. However, historically, I believe it has been more difficult to\nremove policy accommodation in a timely fashion, which may have consequences for a\n\ncentral bank’s longer-term inflation objective.\n\nSecond, the monetary policy transmission mechanism relies heavily on a well­\nfunctioning financial system and operates through the relatively narrow channel of\nsectors that are sensitive to the cost of credit, such as housing. In the current situation,\n\nmonetary stimulus is facing significant headwinds from the weak condition of some of\n\nthe interest-sensitive sectors, as well as restrictions in credit availability and a repricing of\n\nrisk, hi these circumstances, a central bank may have to ease policy more in order to\n\nachieve its desired effect. Third, there is a risk that an extended period of low interest\nrates may distort long-run investment decisions; lead to a search for yield that results in\nexcessive risk-taking; and contribute to the development of asset price bubbles.\n\nIn my view, these limitations are significant, and they lead me to believe that we\n\nshould look to fiscal policy to play a more important role in responding to the economic\nspillovers from a financial crisis. In contrast to monetary policy, fiscal policy can work\n\neffectively even when the financial system is impaired, and its effects are felt more\nbroadly across the economy. My own view is that monetary policy may be a good first\n\nline of defense, but should not be relied on too heavily for too long. Of course, we would\nhave to rely less on monetary policy to respond to financial crises if we could, instead,\n\ntake measures that would reduce the likelihood or severity of financial crises. I would\nlike to hini next to a discussion of some of these options.\n\n\f6\n\nPreventing financial crises\nAs we look to actions that would make financial crises less likely and less severe,\n\nthere is considerable scope for improvement along many dimensions. These include\nactions that may be forthcoming from the private sector as well as by policymakers. I\nwould like to offer a few thoughts on some of these alternatives.\n\nMarket discipline and market best practices\n\nOne theme that has come up in discussions of how to prevent future financial\ncrises is greater market discipline. My views on the role of market discipline are\n\nsomewhat different from most in the regulatory and academic conununities, hi principle,\nmarket discipline is a powerful corrective to the risk-taking incentives of financial\n\ninstitutions. In practice, however, it does not work well in a system of large and complex\nfinancial institutions. For market discipline to work, investors and creditors need good\ninformation, but more importantly, they need to believe that their money is truly at risk.\n\nUndoubtedly, poor information and complexity contributed to the current crisis, and steps\ntoward greater transparency and standardization will be helpful going forward. However,\n\nI think it is naive to think that creditors will view their investments hi the largest financial\ninstitutions as truly at risk. Consequently, I do not think that increased market discipline\nis likely to be the panacea that some believe.\n\nI do think, however, that there is considerable scope for industry efforts to\nimprove best practices. The rapid pace of financial innovation dining the past two\ndecades has made it difficult for both market participants and regulators to stay abreast of\nthe changing financial landscape. However, I think there are limits to what can be\n\n\faccomplished here, and I don’t think markets can solve these problems without support\n\nfrom prudential supervision and regulation. We have all heard discussions of how poor\n\nmanagement, lack of investor knowledge and fraud may have contributed to the current\ncrisis, hi my view, the problems go much deeper to the incentives built into the market\n\nplace by regulation, accounting standards and industry practices. These incentive\nproblems must be dealt with if we are going to move toward a more stable financial\nsystem. Finally, we need to continue to recognize that there are significant externalities\n\nin financial markets that cannot be internalized adequately by the private sector and that\nwill continue to require a significant role for supervision and regulation.\n\nScope for supervision and regulation\nIn thinking about the scope for supervision and regulation in preventing future\n\nfinancial crises, I would offer an analogy between a financial crisis and a fire in a home\nor business. A fire can have serious effects on individual structures, but like a financial\n\ncrisis, is also subject to contagion that allows it to spread to other institutions. One way\n\nof dealing with fires, is to have a fire department to provide liquidity to put out the fire\nand help contain its spread. Ure role of a centr al bank hr responding to a financial crisis\nis not unlike the role of the fire department.\nHowever, most communities do not rely exclusively on a fire department to put\n\nout fires after they start, but to have policies and procedures designed to prevent fires or\n\ncontain them at a very early stage. These policies and procedures include building codes\nthat require sprinkler systems, fire doors and flame retardant materials, and also include\nfire inspectors to ensure that these regulations are being followed. Again, the analogy\n\nwith regulation and prudential supervision is clear. My take on this analogy is that in the\n\n\f8\n\npolicy sphere we are relying too heavily on the fire department to put out financial fires\n\nand, going forward we need to focus more on fire prevention.\nIn the area of supervision, I would offer two thoughts. First, the curr ent financial\n\ncrisis reinforces the importance for a central bank to have accurate and timely\ninformation on the condition of all institutions that might make use of its liquidity\n\nfacilities. Personally, I believe this is most likely to happen when the central bank has\n\nongoing supervisory responsibilities for all institutions eligible to use its liquidity\nfacilities. Thus, I am not a supporter of the removal of supervisory responsibilities from\n\ncentral banks as has happened in a number of countries. If this separation is in effect, or\nsegmented as it is in the United States, I believe a central bank must have the legal\nauthority to require this information from the supervisory agency on terms set by the\n\ncentr al bank. A voluntary exchange of this important information is no more likely to be\neffective in a financial context than it was in the U.S. intelligence community prior to\n\n9/11.\n\nAs to whether increased supervision can be relied upon to prevent financial fires, I\nhave some doubts based on my years in an examination and supervisory capacity. A key\n\nfeature in the current crisis is how well known the build up in leverage and risk-taking\nwas in a variety of financial markets in recent years. When times are good, as they have\n\nbeen for many years and banks appear well capitalized, it is very difficult for bank\nsupervisors to convince bankers to heed warnings that they need to behave differently.\nIndeed, in many situations, there may be no legal basis for requiring a change in business\n\nor lending practices. Thus, I don’t think we can expect expanded supervision to prevent\n\nthe types of financial excesses we have seen in recent years. Consequently, while there\n\n\f9\nmay be improvements in supervision practices that can be implemented as a post-mortem\n\nto this crisis, I think we need to be realistic about what we can expect in this area.\nWhere we might be more successfill in preventing future financial conflagrations\nis in the regulatory sphere. My own view is that we should consider hard wiring more\n\nsprinkler systems into financial markets and institutions. One obvious area to look is\n\nwhether we can improve the risk-based capital approach embodied in Basel II. If capital\nis to function effectively, it needs to rise as risks increase and be depleted as losses\nmaterialize. I think we need to look especially at how we can limit the procyclical\n\nbehavior of leverage that we have observed in some large financial institutions. In\n\naddition, I believe there may be merit in considering formal liquidity requirements, and\nperhaps loan-to-value ratios for banks and other financial instihrtions, especially the large\ninstitutions that provide liquidity and risk-management products to other financial\ninstihrtions and to financial markets. I also think that it is time that we extinguish some\n\nof the off-balance sheet fictions that have developed to excess in recent years.\nConcluding comments\nIn conclusion, let me stress a gam my belief that the response to this crisis should\n\nbe fundamental reform, not Band-Aids and tourniquets. I also think both the private\nsector and government will have key roles to play in articulating needed reforms and\n\nensuring they are implemented. The task is made all the more complex, of course\nbecause of the broad scope of our modern financial system that encompasses many\n\ndifferent types of institutions across a variety of regulatory and national boundaries. We\nalso need to strike an appropriate balance between the many benefits that can come from\n\n\f10\nan innovative and dynamic financial system and the tremendous costs to people and\ninstitutions that result when financial fires rage out of control.\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nThe Central Exchange\nKansas City, Missouri\nJanuary 10. 2008\n\n\f2\n\nThank you. It is a pleasure to once again join you at the Central Exchange and\nshare my perspectives on the cunent state of the U.S. economy and my outlook for 2008.\n\nAs you know, over the past year the economy has experienced considerable stress. A\n\nslumping housing market has caused weaker growth, and higher food and energy prices\nhave boosted inflation. In addition, rising mortgage delinquencies have caused\n\nconsiderable turmoil in financial markets around the world, leading the Federal Reserve\nand other central banks to take actions to stabilize financial markets and limit the effects\n\nof these disruptions on the broader economy. These developments have led to\nconsiderable pessimism in the media about the prospects for the U.S. economy in the\n\nperiod ahead and increased speculation about the possibility of a recession.\nAlthough I, like others, see a significant slowing of economic activity through the\nfirst quarter of 2008, there also is a case to be made that growth will strengthen over the\nbalance of the year. And, hr my view, the likelihood of a recession is smaller than others\n\nare suggesting. I also judge that in the cunent economic environment, the challenge for\n\nmonetary policy in the coming year is especially difficult and will be influenced not only\nby the risk to growth but the risk of inflation.\n\nLet me now turn to a more detailed discussion of the economy’s performance\nover the past year and my thoughts on the economic outlook and monetary policy in the\n\nnew year. My comments today represent my own views. I am not speaking on behalf of\nthe Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Economy’s Performance in 2007\nLast year was challenging for the U.S. economy as the housing slowdown\nintensified and led to significant losses for major financial institutions and disruptions in\n\n\f3\n\nfinancial markets. In addition, higher food and energy prices boosted overall measures of\ninflation. Despite these challenges, however, overall economic performance remained\n\nsolid as consumer, business and government spending remained sound and as a lower\ndollar boosted exports to our major trading partners. Moreover, there were important\n\nregional differences in economic performance, with the Midwest doing significantly\nbetter than some other parts of the country.\nHousing and inflation\n\nThe big story of the past year, of course, was the continuing decline in housing\nactivity. Since the beginning of 2006, new housing construction has declined by more\nthan 50 percent, sales of new and existing homes have plummeted, inventories of new\n\nand existing homes have ballooned, and house prices have fallen significantly in many\nparts of the country. And, unfortunately, the bottom has not yet been reached as housing\n\nstarts, pennits, and sales fell significantly in the most recent November data.\nTo a large extent, the housing slump represents the unwinding of a surge in\nhousing construction and house prices earlier in this decade that was fueled by low\n\ninterest rates and ample credit. Both subprime lending and speculative activity played a\n\nkey role in these developments. With higher interest rates and slower house price\nappreciation in 2005 and 2006, however, the housing market changed abruptly. Many\n\nborrowers were simply not qualified to borrow in the first place, and others could not\nmeet higher mortgage payments when their adjustable-rate mortgages reset. As mortgage\n\ndelinquencies and foreclosures rose, higher inventories of unsold homes placed additional\ndownward pressure on house prices.\n\n\f4\nIn the past, traditional mortgage lenders, such as banks and savings and loans,\n\nbore the brunt of a decline in housing activity. However, over the past 25years, housing\nfinance has changed considerably. Many mortgage loans, particularly subprime loans,\n\nhave been originated by nonbank mortgage lenders and have been “securitized” and used\n\nas collateral for bonds that are sold to investors in the United States and abroad. These\ninvestors are now exposed to this decline in housing activity as mortgage defaults reduce\nthe value of the underlying collateral.\nIndeed, last August, the housing slump took a new and unexpected twist as rising\n\ndelinquency and foreclosure rates on “securitized” subprime mortgages caused investors\n\nto flee from mortgage-backed securities. Hie resulting financial panic affected financial\n\nmarkets in the United States and a number of other countries and caused severe strains on\nthe banking system in the United States and abroad.\n\nAs these financial pressures worsened, the Federal Reseive and other central\nbanks began a series of actions to restore liquidity to financial markets. For example, the\n\nFederal Reseive attempted to make funds available to banks through its Discount\nWindow. Its actions included reducing the interest rate and extending the term on its\n\nloans to banks. Last month, the Federal Reseive took additional steps to provide funding\nto banks by introducing a new Tenn Auction Facility, which allowed banks to obtain\n\nneeded longer-term funding through a competitive auction.\nIn addition to the direct effects of the housing crisis on financial markets, the\n\nFederal Reseive recognized that these financial disruptions could have potential effects\non the broader economy by reducing credit availability to households and businesses and\n\nby damaging consumer and business confidence. To limit the potential spillover of\n\n\f5\n\nfinancial distress to the broader economy, the FOMC lowered its target federal funds rate\nfrom 5 A percent to 4 Y* percent over the past four months.\n\nUnderlying economic strength\n\nDespite these considerable challenges and the attention they have received, you\nmay be surprised to know just how well the overall economy performed last year. While\nhousing accounts for between 6 percent and 8 percent of total GDP and its decline was\n\nsubstantial, it was not the only economic event in 2007. Strength in other sectors resulted\n\nin good overall economic performance. Indeed, even with a significant slowdown in\ngrowth in the fourth quarter expected by most forecasters, GDP growth for 2007 is likely\nto come in at 2.5 percent or slightly higher when we get full-year data later this month.\nMoreover, despite a decline in construction and manufacturing jobs, overall employment\n\ngrowth remained solid.\nBehind this solid economic growth were some pretty substantial factors. For\n\nexample, consumers, despite the housing slump and higher food and energy prices,\n\ncontinued to spend. And, businesses and government continued to invest and spend at\nvery good levels. A particularly important factor was a rise in U.S. exports. Sales of\n\nU.S. products abroad have surged over the past year, supported by strong growth in the\neconomies of our major trading partners and by the decline in the dollar, which has\nreduced the price of U.S. exports.\n\nRegional Differences\nFinally, let me focus on some significant regional differences in economic\nperformance. Having spent considerable time traveling this region over the past year, I\nsuspect that some of you have experienced a “disconnect” between media reports of\n\n\f6\n\neconomic weakness and your own personal experience. Indeed, there have been\nimportant regional differences in economic performance across this counhy. The\n\nMidwest and the Tenth District, in particular, have generally performed better than the\n\nnation as a whole. Part of the regional variation is due to differences in housing markets.\n\nWhile housing is weaker than normal almost everywhere, it has been especially weak in\nthose pails of the counhy, such as Florida and the West Coast, that experienced the\nlargest boom in housing construction and housing prices in recent years. For the most\npart, this part of the counhy did not experience the boom and has not experienced as\n\nmuch fallout from the housing collapse.\nhi addition, energy and agriculture play a relatively more important role in our\n\npart of the country, and the strength in these sectors has more than offset the slower\n\nhousing sector. This performance is reflected in District labor markets, where businesses\ncontinue to report difficulty in finding qualified workers, and in state and local\ngovernment finances, where revenue growth has supported needed spending for\n\ninfrastructure and education in many District states.\nInflation Trends and Their Risks\n\nUnfortunately, although the housing slump received most of the headlines, it was\n\nnot the only challenge the economy faced in 2007. Inflation accelerated at a most\n\ninconvenient time. Rising food and energy prices caused the overall inflation rate to\nsurge to its highest level hi several years. Through November, overall CPI inflation was\n\n4.3 percent on a 12-month basis, up significantly from the 2.5 percent rate in 2006.\nRising food prices were caused by both demand and supply factors. Higher incomes in\ndeveloping countries and the ethanol boom in the United States have spurred increased\n\n\f7\ndemand for many agricultural products, and world supplies have been affected by\n\ndrought in some producing countries\nEnergy prices also increased significantly last year. Crude oil prices rose by\n\nnearly 60 percent over the course of the year as demand continued to outpace supply and\n\ngeopolitical uncertainty and speculative activity also contributed to higher prices. Core\ninflation, while more moderate dian overall inflation, is now running at a 2.3 percent\n\nannual rate.\n\nThe Economy and Monetary Policy in 2008\nWith this review of the economy as background, let me him now to a discussion\n\nof the economic outlook and the challenges for monetary policy in the upcoming year.\nAs I indicated earlier, most forecasters believe the economy slowed significantly in the\n\nfourth quarter to about 1 percent from the third quarter’s 4.9 percent pace. While I am\nnot as pessimistic as some about the outlook, the fact is there most likely will be a\n\ncontinued slowdown as we move into this year with many growth estimates for the first\nquarter at around 1.5 percent.\nWhatever the final figures, a slower pace of growth is likely and is the result of a\n\ncombination of factors. Part of it is cyclical and represents some offset to the unusually\nstrong pace in the second and third quarters of last year. In particular, government\nspending is expected to slow somewhat and manufacturers are reducing inventories after\n\nstrong gains in preceding quarters. In addition, the continuing weakness in housing and\n\nthe impact of higher energy prices on consumer spending for autos and other durable\n\ngoods will contribute to lower growth.\n\n\f8\nHowever, as we move into the second quarter of the year and beyond, many\n\nforecasters see growth picking up, even gaining momentum. This expected pickup comes\nfrom several sources including strengthened manufacturing as domestic demand remains\nstable and export growth remains strong. Also, while hardly a rallying point, GDP\n\ngrowth should be helped to some extent by a slowing in tire decline of housing. Also,\nwhile energy prices most likely will remain elevated, most expect some slowing in the\nrise of energy prices, thus giving consumers some added spending power for other goods.\n\nAnd finally, the policy easing that the Federal Reserve has undertaken in recent\nmonths will provide additional stimulus as we move through the year.\n\nFrom my perspective, the outlook for inflation is less clear and therefore of\nconcern. To the extent the economy’s GDP slows to 2 percent or less, we should see\n\nsome moderation in what otherwise might be accelerating inflationary pressures. But this\noutcome is far from certain. There remains, at this point, strong global demand for\n\nresources and, in the United States, upward price pressures for both goods and services.\nThus, while my views on inflation are not significantly different than that of the\n\nconsensus forecast, they are, at the moment, on the higher end of views.\n\nPulling this all together. I expect GDP growth for the year to be in the range of 2\npercent to 2.5 percent measured on a Q4-over-Q4 basis. I also expect the rise in overall\ninflation to moderate as the U.S. economy slows, but I do not expect any quick reversal\n\nof inflation trends, and I therefore expect core inflation to remain above 2 percent.\nRA&s to the outlook\n\nWhile this forecast represents a best estimate, like all forecasts it may not\nmaterialize. In particular, the continuing fallout from the housing crisis and financial\n\n\f9\n\nmarket disruptions could lead to weaker growth. This outcome would be more likely if\n\nthose financial institutions that have experienced losses in recent months reduce credit\navailability to households and businesses. The resulting credit crunch could reduce\n\ngrowth significantly below consensus estimates and represents an important downside\nrisk to the economy over the next several months.\n\nAnother way the consensus forecast might prove wrong is its outlook for\ninflation. While in 2007 inflation expectations remained contained, this could change if\n\ninflation rates continue to rise. In 2008, there are a number of factors that could lead to\n\nupward pressure on overall and core inflation and perhaps cause long-term inflation\n\nexpectations to rise, thus undermining our long-term stable inflation goal. These include\nthe effects of the weaker dollar on import prices and the slower trend productivity growth\n\nexperienced in recent years. In addition, if food and energy prices do not moderate as\n\nforecast, they could further add to these inflation pressures. Thus, another important risk\nto the forecast is that inflation could move higher.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nLet me close then with a brief discussion of the outlook for monetary policy in the\ncoming year. And let me preface these final remarks by emphasizing the view that in the\n\nconduct of policy, the central bank must take a long-run approach in its selection among\nthe policy options. Such choices are never simple and sometimes not obvious, but to\nfocus on only short-run disturbances is to assure broader problems as the economy\n\nevolves going forward.\nThe FOMC has eased policy significantly over the past four months to limit the\npotential spillover of financial market disruptions to the broader economy. And the fact\n\n\f10\nis that many financial market participants believe that more easing is likely in the coming\nmonths. These views are understandable and place significant weight on the downside\n\nrisks to the outlook and especially the possible development of a credit crunch.\nBut if the economy continues to expand at a modest but reasonable rate above 2\n\npercent, then the case for further easing would be less convincing, especially in light of\nthe recent moves. And, if the economy strengthens above forecasts, then the risks of\n\nhigher inflation would increase more significantly, hi this instance, the Federal Reserve\nwould need to consider an unwinding of its recent policy easing, especially if inflation\n\nexpectations also move higher.\nLet me close by recognizing that the economy is faced with some obvious\ndifficult challenges as we enter 2008. Growth has slowed as we exit 2007 and there are\nrisks that the economy could falter further this year. But still, on balance the economy in\n\n2007 grew at a solid pace despite the drag from housing. Other sectors have held up well\n\nand the prospects for 2008 are reasonably good if these sectors hold up as they have in\nthe recent past. In addition, inflation, while still modest, is on the high side of acceptable\nlevels and we must not lose sight of its harm to the economy if it fails to recede as\n\nexpected.\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nSanta Fe, N.M.\nNovember 15, 2007\n\n\f2\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be in Santa Fe. In my remarks today, I want to\nprovide my perspective on the national economy and monetary policy in the period ahead.\n\nAs you know, over the past few months, problems in U.S. housing markets have\nintensified and have caused severe stress in financial markets in the United States and\n\nabroad. These events have led to timely actions by the Federal Reserve and other central\nbanks to provide stability to financial markets. In particular, to help ensure that these\n\ndevelopments do not spill over to the broader economy, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) lowered its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points on\nSept. 18 and then again by 25 basis pints on Oct. 31, bringing the federal funds rate target\n\ndown to 4.5 percent.\nSince housing represents the largest risk to short-term economic growth, I will\n\ndevote most of my time this evening to a discussion of the magnitude of the problems in\nhousing, some of the causal factors behind the housing slump, and how the problems in\n\nhousing are likely to affect the economic and monetary policy outlook over the next few\n\nquarters. I will then close with some brief comments on the economic outlook and\nmonetary policy in the period ahead.\n\nDimensions of the Housing Slump\n\nLet me begin by looking at the magnitude of the housing slowdown and its impact\non the overall economy. Over the past year and a half, we have seen the largest\ncontraction in U.S. housing markets since the early 1990s. Sales of new and existing\nhomes have declined by 45 percent and 30 percent, respectively, from their peaks in 2005.\n\nSingle family housing starts, which represent new construction, have fallen by 46 percent.\nAnd, as sales and construction have fallen, we have seen inventories of unsold new and\n\n\f3\nexisting homes rise dramatically, putting downward pressure on prices. Indeed, as\n\nmeasured by the Case-Shiller index of repeat home sales, home prices are falling\n\nnationally for the first time since the early 1990s.\nWhen we look at the impacts of this housing slump on the overall economy, it is\nimportant to keep some things in mind. First, the direct effects of housing occur mainly\n\nthrough the value of new housing construction and sales commissions on new and\nexisting homes. In addition, when home sales decline, consumers may also cut back\n\npurchases of other household items, such as furniture and appliances. On the other hand,\nin these circumstances some existing homeowners may remodel or improve their house,\n\nwhich tends to boost spending.\nhi contrast, changes hi house prices do not have direct effects on economic\n\nactivity because they represent capital gams or losses not associated with current\n\nproductive activity. However, house price changes can have an indirect effect on\neconomic activity to the extent that they affect consumers’ wealth. While not as\npowerfill as changes in households’ earned income, these wealth effects are not\n\ninsignificant. Indeed, economists now estimate that the wealth effects from house price\nchanges may be as large as, or even larger than, the wealth effects from stock price\n\nchanges.\nWith these points in mind, we see that the housing slump has had a significant\neffect on real GDP growth. Over the past six quarters, we have seen double-digit\npercentage declines in residential construction expenditures, which measures the direct\n\neffects of housing on GDP. Even though residential construction expenditures represent\n\nonly about 6 percent of overall economic activity, the magnitude of the decline has been\n\n\f4\nenough to reduce real GDP growth by a full percentage point - a large effect indeed. The\nindirect effects of the housing slowdown are more difficult to measure but have likely\nreduced other consumer- spending by a somewhat smaller amount. As a result, over the\n\npast six quarters, GDP growth has averaged about 2.25 percent, considerably below\nestimates of potential growth of around 2.75 percent.\nWhile the housing slowdown has contr ibuted to slower economic growth, I\nbelieve it is important to recognize how strength in other parts of the economy has\nsupported economic activity. In the past, housing slumps similar in magnitude to the\n\ncurrent episode have often been associated with a recession. While growth has slowed\nrecently, we have not come close to a recession because solid consumer spending,\n\ngovenunent spending and a boom in exports have more than offset the housing weakness,\nhr fact, while employment growth has softened somewhat over the last year, we have\n\nseen only a small increase in the unemployment rate. Moreover, we have seen\nimprovement in core inflation from the elevated levels of last year.\n\nUnderstanding Recent Events in Housing and Financial Markets\n\nOver the past few mouths, however, a new dimension has been added to the\nhousing problem. A number of nonbank mortgage lenders have experienced difficulties,\n\nand some have gone out of busmess as new mortgage originations have declined and as\ndefault rates on existing mortgages have risen. Financial markets in the United States\n\nand abroad have been disrupted by investor fears that further defaults may lie ahead and\nthat they may be more exposed to these problems than they thought. As the disruptions\n\nin mortgage markets have spread to other financial markets, the Federal Reserve and\n\n\f5\nother central banks have responded to these pressures by providing additional liquidity\n\nthrough the Discount Window and through open market operations.\nSince these recent developments are so important to the economic outlook, I\n\nwould like to take a few minutes to discuss what’s behind them and also place them in\nhistorical context.\n\nFrom a longer-term perspective, it is important to recognize that the recent\n\nproblems in housing are coming at the end of a very long-lasting and unprec edented\nboom hi housing. Beginning in the late 1990s, we saw a significant increase in new\nhousing construction, along with rising homeownership rates, and several years of\ndouble-digit house price increases in many parts of the country.\n\nSome of this prior boom in housing has been attributed to speculative activity,\n\nspurred by the low interest rates and easy availability of credit in the early part of this\ndecade. Not surprisingly, this activity has largely ceased with rising credit costs and\n\nfalling house prices. However, in my opinion, the rise and fall of speculative activity is\nnot the main story behind recent events.\n\nThe bigger part of the story is the tremendous changes we have seen in the\nstructure of housing finance over the past two decades. We have gone from a system of\nhousing finance centered around depository institutions, savings and loans, and banks, to\n\na new system of market-based finance in which private investors, here and abroad,\n\nprovide the financing for housing. We have also seen significant changes hi the structure\n\nof mortgage contracts, which have altered the risk profile of these contracts significantly.\nOne key change in the structure of housing finance is the development of\n\nsecuritization, in which individual home mortgages are packaged together and used as\n\n\f6\ncollateral for a type of bond called a mortgage-backed security (MBS). These bonds are\n\npurchased by investors such as pension and mutual funds both in the United States and\nabroad.\nIn the past, mortgages were typically originated, financed and serviced by local\n\ndepository institutions. With securitization, the financing can come from investors\nanywhere hi the world. In addition, securitization has facilitated the enhance of new\n\ninstitutions into the housing markets that are largely unregulated because they do not fit\n\ninto the existing regulatory and supervisory structure for depository institutions.\nhi terms of the mortgage contract itself, two important developments stand out.\n\nThe first is the growth in the use of adjustable-rate loans. Adjustable-rate Ioans have\nbecome popular because they usually have lower payments and so may be more\n\naffordable than fixed-rate loans. However, they also place the risk of interest rate and\npayments changes on the borrower rather than the lender.\n\nThe second development in the mortgage contract is the use of risk-based pricing,\nthat is, mortgage rates based on the household’s credit rating. This change has allowed\n\nmany households who could not previously qualify for a so-called “conventional” loan to\nobtain a mortgage loan. This change has fostered the rapid growth in subprime lending\nover the past several years.\n\nIf we combine these two developments, we can go a long way toward an\nunderstanding of the housing slump and why it spread to financial markets around the\nworld. Let’s start with subprime Ioans. In the last several years, their growth has\naccelerated, totaling an estimated 20 percent of mortgage originations in 2005-2006.\n\n\f7\nMany were made as adjustable-rate loans, and some had features, such as low “teaser”\n\nrates and negative amortization, to make them more affordable.\nWhen these loans experienced their first rate reset, the borrowers experienced a\n\nlarge rate increase and much higher monthly payments. Hie problem was exacerbated by\nthe rise in short-term interest rates as the Federal Reserve tightened policy from 2004 to\n\n2006. Indeed, over the past year, the delinquency rates on subprime loans have increased\n\nconsiderably. As of 2007 Q2, delinquency rates on adjustable-rate subprime loans rose to\nmore than 16 percent compared to 4 percent on prime adjustable-rate loans and only\n\nabout 2 percent on prime fixed-rate loans.\nBut why, you might ask. did these rising delinquency rates have so large an\n\nimpact on financial markets around the world? Like conventional mortgage loans, many\nsubprime loans have been securitized in recent years. As the default rates on these loans\nrose, investors holding securities backed by these loans sold these securities, driving\n\ndown their prices and imposing capital losses on remaining holders. More generally,\n\ninvestors withdrew from securities not backed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae guarantees.\nWith the growth of international capital markets in recent years, many of these securities\n\nhave been purchased by financial institutions and private investors abroad, including in\n\nCanada. Europe and Asia. Consequently, the effects of these disruptions in U.S.\nmortgage markets have spread to financial markets around the world.\nFurthermore, some nonbank mortgage lenders funded their holdings of mortgages\n\nand mortgage-backed securities by issuing asset-backed commercial paper. As the\nmortgage market tunnoil increased, these institutions found it impossible to get investors\nto purchase their commercial paper. These institutions then turned to banks for short-\n\n\f8\nterm loans, which then funded these loans in short-term money markets. As bank\n\nfunding pressures increased, the Federal Reserve and other central banks temporarily\nprovided additional reserves to meet these needs and keep money markets operating.\n\nWith these central bank actions, and especially following the Federal Reserve’s\ndecision to tower its federal funds rate target on Sept. 18, markets have improved\n\nsomewhat. However, financial market functioning has not returned to normal even with\nthe FOMC’s decision to tower its funds rate target again on Oct. 31st. The market for\n\nconventional mortgage loans, in particular, has been functioning well, with rates on these\nloans moving down slightly in recent weeks. In contrast, the markets for\nnonconventional loans, subprime and jumbo loans, continue to experience difficulty.\nMoreover, since many subprime loans made in late 2005 and 2006 have not yet\n\nexperienced their first rate reset, subprime delinquencies are expected to rise into next\nyear.\n\nImplications for the Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nThese recent events in housing markets and financial markets have led many\nforecasters to tower their estimates of economic growth over the next few quarters. Some\ncommentators have suggested that a recession is much more likely, perhaps inevitable.\nIn my remaining time. I would like to offer my own perspectives on the economic\n\noutlook and monetary policy in the period ahead. I stress that they are my own views and\n\ndo not represent those of the FOMC or the Federal Reseive System.\nRealistically, there are a number of avenues by which housing and financial\nmarket stress could lead to a further reduction in growth. First, as bad as the housing\n\nslump has been, it could get worse. Second, the recent difficulties in financial markets\n\n\f9\ncould lead to a more general tightening of credit conditions that could reduce consumer\nor business borrowing. Third, the housing and financial market difficulties could lead to\nreduced business and consumer confidence, leading to lower spending.\n\nWhile I take these possibilities very seriously, my own view is that the economy\nshould weather this storm. I do expect somewhat slower growth over the next two to\n\nthree quarters coming mainly from continuing weakness in housing and somewhat tighter\ncredit conditions. I think the effects of the financial market disruptions are unlikely to\nspread very far, however, in part because of the timely actions of the Federal Reserve and\n\nother central banks hi meeting liquidity pressures.\n\nFinancial market conditions have improved, but they are not yet back to normal.\n\nFor example, while commercial paper outstanding has generally stopped declining,\n\nvolumes have not returned to preturmoil levels and currently equal their April 2006 levels.\nAlso, while commercial paper and corporate spreads have declined from their peaks, they\n\nalso are not back to pre tunnoil levels. In addition, the improvement has been subject to\n\nshort-term reversals. For example, over the last few weeks we have seen some pullback\nas markets adjust to surprising news from some financial institutions. This should not be\nsurprising in a market economy that is trying to find and then move to a new set of\n\nequilibrium prices.\nFinally, as to monetary policy in the period ahead, the FOMC sets monetary\n\npolicy in order to achieve its dual objective of maximum sustainable employment and\nstable prices.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s easing of monetary policy, along with the recent declines\nin the dollar, should support growth in the near term. The FOMC has reduced its federal\n\n\f10\nfunds rate target by a cumulative 75 basis points over the last two months. In addition to\nsupporting growth, the easing of policy can be viewed as an insurance policy against\n\nsome of the possible adverse effects from financial stress. And, as I noted earlier, growth\nin U.S. exports has been a source of strength during the housing slump. The recent\n\ndecline in the dollar should provide even more impetus to export growth over the next\nfew quarters.\nHowever, the Federal Reserve must also be vigilant about the longer-term\ninflation outlook. As we have learned the hard way over the last quarter-century, low and\n\nstable inflation is essential for maximum sustainable employment. In tills regard, recent\n\ndata on core inflation continues to be favorable, and I expect overall inflation next year\n\nwill moderate as the effects of higher food and energy prices wear off and energy prices\nthemselves level off.\nDespite these recent favorable trends, though, upside risks to inflation remain.\n\nGreater dollar depreciation and higher energy and commodity prices, along with a greater\n\npass-through from all thee, could push inflation higher for a period of time. In addition,\n\nwe have seen a gradual up-creep in some measures of longer-term inflation expectations.\n\nIn looking to the future, the Federal Reserve must be mindful of both objectives:\nconducting policy to ensure maximum sustainable employment without putting its\n\nobjective of stable prices hi jeopardy. Policy will need to respond to the evolution of the\neconomy in terms of both gr owth and inflation. At this time, I believe the risks on both\nsides of this policy decision are elevated, and we need to wait, watch and be ready to act\n\ndepending on how events develop.\n\n\f11\n\nThat concludes my prepared remarks, and I would be happy to address your\n\nquestions.\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nHigh Level Meeting on Regulatory Capital and Issues in Financial Stability\nSydney, Australia\nNovember 6, 2007\n\n\f2\n\nIt is a pleasure to be in Sydney today to participate in this meeting and to offer my\n\nperspectives on some of the recent events in financial markets and their implications for\n\nfinancial stability. Over the past three decades, we have experienced an increased\nnumber of financial crises in many countries around the world. These crises have taken\n\nplace in many different parts of the financial system, including: banking and payments\n\nsystems, housing finance systems, securities markets, and currency markets. Central\nbanks and other authorities charged with maintaining financial stability have drawn\nimportant lessons from each of these crises and have instituted regulatory and policy\n\nchanges that have helped strengthen the financial system in the wake of these crises.\nIndeed, forums like this meeting are extremely helpfill in providing a venue for\n\ndiscussion of these crises and possible policy responses.\nDespite our best efforts, much like a vims responds to the body’s immune system\n\ndefenses, financial crises have continued to return in modified form, requiring ongoing\nvigilance by policymakers. Moreover, the task of maintaining financial stability has\nbecome more difficult over time because of the changing structure of the financial\n\nsystem. As you may know, many countries are in the process of shifting from a bank­\nbased system of financial intermediation to a capital markets-based system. The pace of\nchange has risen as well, with many new financial products and many new players in the\n\nfinancial landscape. In addition, the intermediation process has become increasingly\ncomplex, posing difficulties both for market participants and policymakers. And, with\nthe increased global linkages among financial markets, disruptions in one market may\n\nspread quickly around the world.\n\n\f3\nUnfortunately, we have not adapted our regulatory and policy framework at the\nsame speed as financial market developments. Our main regulatory and supervisory\n\npolicies and our central bank liquidity facilities are best positioned to deal with traditional\n\nbanking crises, and appear less adequate to deal with crises that increasingly originate in\nfinancial markets and outside the banking system.\nIn my remarks today. I would like to use the recent subprime mortgage crisis to\n\nmotivate a broader discussion of how we can maintain financial stability in a changing\nfinancial system. While the recent crisis has revealed some new and unexpected\n\nvulnerabilities in the financial system, it has also highlighted the need to remember some\nof the lessons we have learned from past crises-as indicated by the title of my speech.\nRecent Evolution of the Financial System\n\nLet me begin my discussion with some general comments on the sweeping\nchanges we are seeing in financial systems around the world. The key development in\n\nthis changing framework is the evolution from a bank-based system of financial\n\nintermediation to a market-based system. Banks retain an important but increasingly\ndifferent role in financial intermediation. For the larger banking organizations, activities\n\nand earnings are now focused more on loan originations and credit risk management\nservices, and less on holding loans on the balance sheet to generate interest income.\n\nWhile some of these developments may be further along in the United States,\nsimilar trends are evident throughout the world. In this new system, investors can be\nvery far removed from borrowers, relying on a number of agents to ensure the smooth\n\nfunctioning of the system. With the increased linkages among financial systems around\n\n\f4\nthe world, financial instruments and claims pass through many hands and often wind up\n\nfar from their origins.\nSeveral factors are behind these dramatic changes in the financial framework.\n\nOne key factor is the enormous growth hi the amount of funds managed by large\ninstitutional investors such as pension and mutual funds. Equally important are\n\ntechno logical innovations in information processing and telecommunications. The\n\nsignificance of these innovations can be seen in the greatly expanded access to timely\nfinancial information by investors and institutions, the substantial reduction in the cost of\n\ngathering and processing such data, and the unimpeded flow of information and\nconununications around the world.\n\nAccompanying these developments are advances in financial theory, which have\nmade it possible for market participants to develop mathematical models to price a wide\n\nvariety of new financial instruments. This financial engineering is also allowing banks\n\nand others to break up the payment flows on debt obligations and partition them into a\n\nwide array of risk tranches, thus allowing firms and investors to actively manage their\nrisk exposures and select the level of risk they are willing to incur.\n\nThe rising importance of market-based finance is leading to several significant\nchanges in the banking industry. With lending for their own portfolios declining in\n\nimportance, banks are expanding then operations in other areas, including trading, market\nmaking, investment banking, and risk management products for themselves and others.\nAnd while the banking industry is still the largest holder of credit market obligations hi\n\nthe United States, this lending has moved away from large corporate lending and now\n\n\f5\nincludes more credit card and real estate construction lending, and loan origination and\nsecuritization activities.\n\nThis changing loan focus, in part, reflects the increased availability of information\nin financial markets and the efficiencies in using these markets. At the same time, the\n\nregulatory and supervisory framework is shaping what banks can do. For example,\nregulation and capital requirements may be making it too costly for banks to hold high-\n\nquality assets on the balance sheet and to compete directly in certain market segments.\nOne important consequence of these changes in financial structure is that we have\n\nseen an evolution in the nature and location of financial crises. Key events in recent\n\ncrises, for instance, have often originated outside of the banking system. In fact, the\nname most commonly ascribed to recent events has been “market turmoil.” Another\n\ncharacteristic of recent events and crises is that they have spread across countries and, in\nmany cases, through surprising and unexpected linkages. These developments have\nraised new challenges for policymakers about how the effects of these crises can be\ncontained and whether conventional policy tools will provide the most desirable and\neffective response. But, they also raise new concerns about moral hazard.\n\nA Conceptual Framework\n\nBefore I talk more specifically about the recent subprime mortgage crisis and its\n\nramifications, it may be helpfill to review the key factors that underpin the functioning of\nthe financial system and the need for policy intervention to maintain financial stability.\n\nAt a very basic level, financial intermediation, whether bank-centered or market­\ncentered, requires overcoming asymmetric information and agency problems. And,\n\n\f6\n\nfinancial intermediation has associated externalities that provide an important role for\npublic policy.\n\nTraditional methods of overcoming problems of asymmetric information include:\nestablishing long-tenn relationships with borrowers, requiring specific equity or capital\nlevels to be maintained, requiring collateral in support of a loan, imposing restrictions on\n\na borrower’s activities and use of loan proceeds, and asking for third-party guarantees of\n\nloan contract performance. Fundamentally, the shift of intermediation from banks to\nmarkets can be understood in terms of markets gaining access to more information on\nwhich to base their funding decisions and having the tools, such as credit scoring, to use\nthis information efficiently.\n\nAgency problems also complicate the intermediation process when the incentives\n\nof agents are not aligned well with the principles they represent. In a bank-based system\nof intermediation, banks serve to internalize many of these agency problems, hi the new\nmarket-based system of finance, the growing complexity of the inteiinediation process\n\nand the increasing number of players that are involved in intermediated transactions are\n\nleaving investors, savers, and borrowers much more dependent on the actions and advice\n\nof others, many of whom may have competing objectives and incentives. This\nmisalignment of incentives may play a role in destabilizing parts of the inteiinediation\n\nprocess and, more generally, the financial system.\nFinally, the financial system exhibits important externalities that can lead to a\nmarket failure and require public intervention to address or realign the focus of market\n\nparticipants. Moreover, given the interconnected nature of financial markets and\n\npayments systems-both on a domestic and an international level-the shocks or\n\n\f7\n\nbreakdowns in one sector caused by externalities can be readily transmitted to other\nsectors, thereby having systemic implications.\n\nThe presence of externalities justifies a strong role for public policy in\nmaintaining and improving the efficiency and stability of the financial system. At a\nmicro or institutional level, these policies include standard setting, regulation, and\n\nsupervision. But there are also connections at the macro level where overall\nmacroeconomic stability can promote financial stability and where financial instability\ncan affect and impair macroeconomic performance.\n\nAs we step back and look at the recent subprime crisis, I find it very helpfill to\nframe my thoughts in terms of these issues. For example, my take on the recent subprime\ncrisis is that the mechanisms that have been developed to overcome asymmetric\ninformation and agency problems in financial markets are much less robust than we may\n\nhave thought. In the case of externalities, my sense is that our traditional policy\n\napproaches, which are designed for a bank-based financial system, may not be as wellsuited to our new, market-based financial system.\nA Closer Look at Recent E.vents\n\nWith these ideas providing a frame of reference, I would now like to take a closer\nlook at the recent U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and its ramifications for the financial\nsystem. Rather than providing a detailed discussion of the evolution of the crisis, which\n\nhas been well-documented by others, I would like to highlight three areas that I believe\npolicymakers should focus on as we try to strengthen the financial system in response to\nthese developments.\n\n\f8\nLiquidity strains\n\nWhile the root of the subprime crisis lies in tr aditional concerns about credit\nquality and credit risk, I believe more attention should focus on the severe liquidity\n\nstrains that enveloped financial markets and which continue, to some extent, even today.\nAs you may know, much of U.S. mortgage finance in recent years has flowed through\ninstitutions outside of the depository system and outside of the formal bank supervisory\n\nand regulatory process. Many of these institutions behaved like traditional depositoiy\ninstihrtions in borrowing short and lending long. With no deposit base, these institutions\nobtained funding in short-term money markets using asset-backed commercial paper.\n\nWhen concerns about subprime credit quality heightened over the summer,\n\ninvestors ran for cover. Those instihrtions without backup lines of credit were forced to\nsell assets, typically at a large loss, and a number were liquidated. Those instihrtions with\nbackup lines of credit with banks were, in many but not all cases, able to obtain funding.\n\nHowever, banks were not well-positioned to meet these demands, and their funding\n\nrequirements placed enormous strains on money markets in Europe and the United States.\nAnd, as you know, these funding pressures necessitated massive amounts of reserve\n\nprovision by central banks through open market operations and lending facilities.\nIn many respects, these are events we have seen before in periods of banking\n\ncrises. What is new is that the initial problems are arising in instihrtions outside of our\nregulatory and supervisory purview and without direct access to traditional elements of\nthe safety net-deposit insurance and access to central bank lender-of-last-resort facilities.\nMoreover, the problems are spilling over very quickly into the banking system, hr\n\naddition to direct exposure through lines of credit, banks have taken an active role in\n\n\f9\nsetting up some of these off-balance-sheet entities and may be holding similar securities\nin their investment and trading portfolios.\n\nBut there is another new dimension to liquidity that has raised the ante in coping\n\nwith financial crises. As we have shifted from a bank-based system to a market system\n\nof finance, the functioning of markets in periods of crisis has become critical. Beginning\nwith the U.S. stock market crash in 1987: then in the Asian, Long-Term Capital\n\nManagement, and international debt crisis in 1997-98; and now in the subprime mortgage\ncrisis, we have seen repeated instances in which markets have seized up and ceased to\nfunction, just when they are most needed. This poses serious problems for those financial\n\ninstitutions that do not have adequate portfolio liquidity and rely on markets to obtain\nliquidity. In addition, without well-functioning markets to establish prices for securities,\n\nit becomes extremely difficult to do the valuation exercises that are required by our mark-\n\nto-market accounting systems.\nAsset valuation\nIndeed, the difficulty in valuing assets in the recent crisis raises a second serious\n\nconcern about our increased reliance on asset valuation models. These models require\n\ngood data on the credit experience and volatilities of the underlying assets. But, they also\n\nrequire good judgment in their application. The subprime crisis has revealed appalling\nweaknesses in both regards. Subprime Ioans do not have a very long history, and their\n\nrecent history is somewhat deceptive because many were made in a period of rapidly\nrising house prices. Thus, valuation of these loans relied very heavily on a judgmental\nbet that the benign market conditions of recent years would continue. In addition,\n\nvaluation exercises did not appear to make sufficient distinctions between types of\n\n\f10\nmortgage contracts offered to subprime borrowers. A fixed-rate, 80 percent loan-to-value\n\nratio Ioan is a very different product from a variable-rate, 100 percent loan-to-value loan\n\neven if they are made to subprime borrowers with the same credit score.\n\nI do not think these valuation problems are confined to assets backed by subprime\nloans. Indeed, they are likely to be veiy pervasive across asset classes because of the\nbenign financial conditions of recent years and the proliferation of nonstandard terms in\ncontracts and bond covenants.\n\nProblems in asymmetric information\nA third issue that I would like to focus on is weaknesses that have been exposed\nin financial markets mechanisms for overcoming asymmetric information and agency\n\nproblems. As I noted earlier, the phenomenal growth of financial markets in recent\n\ndecades is largely a result of the development of methods to get around these problems.\nIn particular, credit ratings have become extremely important in supporting the growth in\n\nasset-backed lending. Why else would investors around the world buy assets backed by\nloans to U.S. borrowers with low credit ratings? Until a few months ago, investors\nviewed credit ratings on privately issued mortgage backed securities as almost equivalent\n\nto the implicit government guarantees on GSE-backed securities. Many investors have\n\nnow discovered the difference between an opinion and a guarantee.\nBecause credit ratings play such an important role in the functioning of markets\nand in Basel II standards, I believe it is extremely important to understand what went\n\nwrong. Despite the self-serving responses of some of the rating agencies, I believe there\n\nare some very serious issues to be addressed. One important issue is the incentive\nconflict that arises because the agencies receive compensation from the companies who\n\n\f11\n\nare obtaining the ratings. Another issue is the models used by the agencies to rate\n\nstructured securities and the judgment used in the rating process.\n\nAs an example, consider a recent story by Allan Sloan in Fortune magazine.\nAccording to Sloan, a mortgage trust assembled by a prominent investment bank had a\n\nportfolio of second mortgage loans that had essentially no borrower equity and had little\nor no documentation on more than half the loans. Amazingly, 93 percent of the tranches\n\nwere rated investment grade by the two main credit-rating agencies. As of September, 18\npercent of the loans had defaulted, wiping out many of the lower-rated tranches.\n\nAnother lesson that markets have “relearned” from recent events is the\nimportance of equity in disciplining behavior. Many of the subprime loans made in\n\nrecent years contained very low homeowner equity. Moreover, as the example above\n\nindicates, much of the so-called equity in these loans was in fact borrowed from other\nlenders through a second mortgage. With no equity and with interest rate resets requiring\n\nmuch higher payments, the viability of these Ioans depended almost entirely on rapid\n\nappreciation in house prices. Of course, issues of excessive leverage in financial markets\nare not confined to subprime mortgage lending.\nThere are similar incentive problems in the mortgage Ioan origination process,\n\nmuch of which now occurs outside the regulated banking system. Mortgage brokers,\n\nrealtors, and appraisers make money through the volume of transactions, but bear little or\n\nno responsibility for the quality of the loans that are made.\nOf course, the same incentive problems for borrowers and intermediaries have\n\nalways been present in bank-based lending. But, over the years, supervision, regulation,\n\nand banks' own risk management and corporate governance practices have provided\n\n\f12\n\nimportant checks and balances on these incentive problems. Unfortunately, our new\nmarket-based system of finance does not appear to have addressed these incentive issues\nappropriately or in a very robust manner.\n\nPolicy Challenges\n\nI would like to close my remarks today with a brief look at some of the policy\nissues that have been raised by these recent events. I will touch briefly on four topics:\nliquidity issues, information and disclosure, incentive problems, and moral hazard\n\nconcerns.\nLiquidity issues\n\nProviding liquidity to the financial system in times of stress is, of course, a\n\nprimary responsibility of central banks. However, because central bank liquidity\nfacilities are generally directed toward the banking system, it is less clear whether the\ntraditional liquidity facilities are well-positioned to meet liquidity pressures that emerge\n\nfrom outside the banking system. As a case irr point, the Federal Reserve’s Discount\n\nWindow facility was not used as much as we might have liked in the recent crisis. Part of\nthe difficulty was the historical stigma issue that has caused banks to be reluctant to use\n\nthe window, part was the relatively high price of Discount Window credit, and part was a\n\nunique feature of the current crisis in which pressures were concentrated in term funding\n\nrather than overnight funding. While the Federal Reserve made a number of temporary\nmodifications to discount procedures to try to enhance the window’s effectiveness, a\nbroader rethinking of the structure of lending facilities may be irr order. As part of this\nexercise, it may be useful to consider whether lending facilities should be accessible to a\n\nbroader range of institutions than has been the case historically.\n\n\f13\n\nA broader question regarding liquidity is who should be responsible for providing\nit: institutions or central banks? In recent years, the U.S. banking system has seen a\n\ndecline in on-balance-sheet liquidity as banks have relied more on liability management\nand purchased funds. The reasons are obvious: as markets have grown, they have\n\nprovided increased liquidity in normal times, and the provision of a liquidity buffer that is\nneeded only occasionally by banks is very costly. So, as we examine how to improve\ncentral banks’ methods for providing liquidity, perhaps we should also consider whether\nthe banking system should play a larger role as well.\n\nThe second type of liquidity issue that I mentioned earlier, market liquidity, is a\nmore complex issue. I really believe that we need to focus more attention on research\n\ninto the microstructure of financial markets to understand why liquidity pressures\ndevelop and why markets seize up in times of crisis. Until we have this understanding,\nwe will be forced to deal with these pressures indirectly via the banking system.\nDisclosure of information\nIn much of the commentary on recent events, there has been a considerable\n\nemphasis on additional disclosure of information to help financial market participants\nmake better decisions. While I have been a long-time advocate of greater disclosure,\n\nespecially in the banking system, I wonder whether these concerns are somewhat\nmisplaced. In this new information age, we have plenty of information. For many of the\nmore complex structured products that have been developed in recent years, it is possible\n\nto obtain most of the underlying data needed to analyze the products. In a sense, the real\n\nproblem may be that we have so much information that, combined with the complexity of\nthe financial products, investors cannot possibly make appropriate risk assessments\n\n\f14\nwithout relying on other agents. Even sophisticated analysts, such as the rating agencies,\nmay not be able to do a thorough and complete analysis. So, I think the information\n\nproblems go much deeper than suggested by calls for additional disclosure.\nCorrecting incentive problems\nhi terms of incentives, I think it is important to ask whether markets are likely to\ncorrect some of the problems themselves or whether they will need substantial assistance.\nIndeed, there are currently a number of legislative proposals in the U.S. Congress\n\ndesigned to address some of these problems. These include greater standardization of\nmortgage products, licensing and regulation of mortgage lenders, and requirements that\n\nborrowers have real equity behind their loans. To be effective, however, some of these\nchanges will require supervision and/or significant financial penalties.\n\nTwo more difficult problems involve the rating agencies and nondepositoiy\nlenders. Given the importance that ratings play both in the new structure of financial\n\nmarkets and in Basel IL some reform of the credit-rating system is imperative, but the\nsolution is not obvious. In the case of nondepository lenders, even though they do not\n\noperate under explicit safety net protection and bank regulation, their behavior does have\nsystemic implications, and they may have ties to larger financial organizations that are\nconsidered too big to fail. While I don't have an answer to whether or how they should\nbe regulated, this is an issue that policymakers may have to address in the future.\n\nMoral hazard issues\n\nFinally, with regard to moral hazard issues, there has been a lot of talk in the\nfinancial media about the implications of policymakers' response to financial crises as\ncreating moral hazard and sowing the seeds for future crises. I believe that some of this\n\n\f15\n\ntalk is clearly off the mark in the sense that responsible parties are in many cases bearing\n\nthe fruit of their bad decisions. They are not being “bailed out.”\n\nHowever, there are some deeper issues here that should give us concern. First, to\nthe extent that some large, systemically important institutions are protected through\n\nforbearance or temporary relaxation of regulations, policymakers are making decisions\nabout who will bear the losses.\n\nSecond, those of you who are familiar with the macroeconomics literature are no\n\ndoubt aware of the relevance of the Lucas Critique to these issues. The Lucas Critique\ninforms us that policymakers must be aware, and take into account, how their actions\n\naffect the expectations of market participants. Hie reason this point is labeled a\n“critique” is that up to the mid-1970s, this style of thinking wasn't common among\n\npolicymakers. Today, we recognize that if policymakers change their behavior, market\nparticipants will take this into account and expect policymakers to behave similarly in the\nfuture.\n\nThus, there is no doubt hi my mind that financial market participants have taken\nnote of central bank actions and will factor these actions into what they expect in the\n\nfuture. So, in this sense, we must recognize that actions that seem appropriate in dealing\n\nwith the current crisis do have future consequences. One example that 1 have referred to\nearlier today and on numerous occasions in the past is “too-big-to-fail.” Another is the\n\nrecent granting of exemptions between bank and financial affiliates under Section 23 A of\nthe Federal Reserve Act. Please note that I am not being critical of changes that\n\npolicymakers implement in times of crises, Indeed. we may find that some temporary\n\n\f16\nchanges are very necessary, and perhaps some should be made permanent. But such\n\nactions have consequences.\n\nIn a similar macroeconomic vein, I believe that to the extent policymakers\nrespond effectively to financial crises, they do alter the behavior of asset prices and\n\ndefault probabilities. Since this information serves as the “history” for our asset\n\nvaluation models, it may become more difficult to use these models effectively in pricing\n\nsecurities or hr conducting risk-sensitivity simulation exercises.\nConcluding Comments\nIrr conclusion, let rue acknowledge that there are many other important issues\n\nraised by recent events that are beyond the scope of my comments. These include how\nthe more widespread implementation of Basel II will change the financial landscape that\n\nwe operate in and how recent events may cause us to rethink how we structure capital\n\nrequirements going forward. In any event, I believe we can rest assured that financial\nmarkets and institutions will continue to evolve so that we will likely need to reconvene\n\nat a future date to address a new set of important policy issues.\n\n\f"

            "content": "COMMUNITY BANKS AND THE FUTURE OF THE KANSAS ECONOMA\"\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nHie Kansas Bankers Association .Annual Meeting\nColorado Springs. Colorado\nAug. 2, 2007\n\n\fIt is a pleasure for me to be here today, and I want to thank you for the opportunity to\n\nspeak at your annual meeting.\n\nThe Kansas Bankers Association has played an important role in the history of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dating back quite literally to our Bank’s founding.\nYou may have read about some of this history earlier this year in an article published in The\n\nKansas Banker.\nWhen the Federal Reserve’s founders were determining locations for the nation’s new\nReserve Banks in 1914, the KBA was especially active in promoting Kansas City. Under the\n\nKBA’s leadership, more than 1,000 Kansas bankers signed cards indicating their support for\n\na Bank in Kansas City. It was an impressive and important showing of unity as the entire\nregion came together for a common purpose. It was also unique, hi many other areas of the\ncountry, bitter local rivalries nearly overwhelmed the individuals responsible for determining\nthe locations of the 12 regional Banks.\n\nThe president of the KBA at that time was an Atchison, Kan. banker named Willis\n\nBailey. Interestingly, Bailey, who was also a former Kansas governor, became a member of\nour Bank’s first Board of Directors. He is also one of my early predecessors, serving as the\n\npresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for 10 years starting in 1922.\nBailey and his work set the stage for a long and important relationship between our\n\norganizations that continues to this day. Over the years, many of you have participated at our\n\nconferences, economic forums and regulatory updates. We have also had a supervisory\nrelationship with nearly all of you, at either a bank or a holding company level. Moreover,\n\nKansas bankers, inchiding some of you, have been important participants on our Board of\nDirectors.\n\n\fAnd recently, we were pleased when a group from the KB A was one of the first to tour\nour new headquarters, which is now under construction. We are extremely happy with\n\nprogress on the project, and we look forward to next spring when we will have the once-in-a-\n\ncentury experience of moving into a new building. We look forward to the KBA joining us in\nthose ceremonies.\n\nToday, I would like to talk about an issue that is important to all of us: the Kansas\neconomy, its future, and the potential opportunities and risks for Kansas banks. I will be\n\nmore than happy to take your questions at the end of my remarks as time allows.\n\nThe economic environment\nOverall, the economy is healthy, with growth accelerating to potential while\nunemployment is low. There are, however, a few key concerns of which you are probably\n\nwell aware. One is residential housing, which might not recover as soon as some have\n\nexpected, and another, of course, is high energy prices, which could push up prices on other\ngoods and slow consumer spending.\nIn this economic environment, recent banking performance has been very strong.\nROAs have generally been high. Credit quality has been good, although slippage is\nbeginning to show in some portfolios.\n\nLooking ahead, Kansas bankers face continuing challenges as the structure of the\nbanking industry and the state economy evolve. As Kansas goes, so goes Kansas banking,\nand so the important questions can be framed around what opportunity will there be in the\n\nKansas economy of the future?\n\n\fWhat sets the Tenth District and Kansas apart?\nThe industrial structure of the Tenth Federal Reserve District, including that of\nKansas, has changed considerably in recent decades, and it will continue to change in the\n\nyears ahead. It is vital for Kansas bankers, as they think about the future of their comnnniity\n\nbanks, to be prepared for whatever they encounter.\nAccording to research by our Bank’s economists, a region’s ability to outperform the\n\nnational economy hinges on the industries that are unique to that area. These defining\n\nindustries are what can differentiate, for better or worse, a local economy from national\ntrends. Knowing both what these industries are and how they are changing is vital for\nrecognizing the opportunities as well as the risks.\nBefore we discuss the industries that most define the Kansas economy, it is important\n\nto look at the overall evolving industrial structure, both in Kansas and more broadly in the\n\nseven states of the Tenth District.\nTo give an idea of just how much the structure of the regional economy has changed\n\nover a long period: At the time of the 1900 Census, nearly half of all workers in the Tenth\n\nDistrict were employed in the agriculture and mining sectors. By 2000, that share had\ndr opped to less than 5 percent. Manufacturing’s share of employment in the region has also\n\nfallen as techno logic al advances make it possible for fewer workers to produce greater\namounts of goods.\n\nDuring tills transformation to a more service-based economy, the industrial structure\nof both Kansas and the entire Tenth District has come to look somewhat more like the rest of\nthe nation. However, it is important to note that in even with this transition, we still remain\n\ndistinctly different, hi a ranking of how closely states mirror the national industrial structure,\n\n\fKansas is 30th, and other states in the Tenth District are even more unique, including New\nMexico, 43rd, and Oklahoma, 47th. Wyoming was the state most unlike the national economy,\n\nfinishing 51st in the ranking, which also included the District of Columbia.\n\nAs you might expect, a few of the Tenth District’s defining industries, or those that\nmost differentiate our region from the rest of the country, include energy extraction and\nagriculture. Others that play a role include such long-standing important industries as meat\n\npacking, aircraft manufacturing, rail transportation and telecommunications.\n\nHowever, in various places across the Tenth District, trew industries are emerging as\nsignificant. These are industries that have achieved critical mass, they pay relatively well and\nthey are expected to continue to grow rapidly. A few examples from various District states\ninclude software and computer systems design, medical laboratories and biosciences, and\n\ndata processing and other high-tech back-office support services.\nMost of the long-standing defining industries for the rest of the Tenth District play the\nsame role in Kansas, and they will likely continue to do so for many years to come. However,\n\nI believe there are also a couple of emerging industries in the state worthy of some attention\n\ntoday, hr order to thrive in the future, Kansas banks need to be aware of what these industries\nare, and what risks and opportunities they present.\n\nOne industry that still highly defines Kansas is aircraft manufacturing—centered in\nWichita. This industry has been hit hard at times in recent decades with defense cutbacks, as\nwell as the overall difficulties of the airline industry following 9/11. But the industry has\n\nperformed well of late—aircraft manufacturing employment in Kansas is up 6 percent from a\n\nyear ago—and the outlook is generally positive. Increases in demand for defense aerospace\n\n\fproduction the past few years and an improving trend in demand for civilian aircraft have\n\ncreated solid job growth.\nAnd demand for personal air travel in general is likely to rise relative to other forms of\ntransportation heading forward, as real incomes rise. This should be a boon for Wichita’s\ncivilian aircraft makers, as well as their many suppliers and employees in the years to come,\n\nproviding some opportunities for Kansas bankers. The industry will likely remain relatively\n\nvolatile, though, presenting some lending risks as well.\n\nAnother highly defining industry in the state is wired telecommunications providers,\ncentered primarily at the Sprint Campus in Johnson Comity but distributed in many ways\nacross the state. Wired telecoms were victims of the high-tech bust of tills decade, brought on\n\nby considerable overinvestment during the 1990s. While performance has improved slightly\nin the past couple of years and some opportunities exist as high-speed wired telecom access\n\nreaches more homes, employment remains well below pre-2001 recession levels, and many\n\nanalysts project the outlook for wired telecoms to not be as solid as for wireless, cable and\nsatellite telecommunications. Industry consolidation and strong price competition are\nexpected to decrease telecom employment as well. But telecormrnmications in general will\nremain important to Kansas bankers, both as they make sure their own bank is up-to-speed on\n\nthe latest capabilities and as they watch the extent to which the important telecom\n\ninfrastructure and expertise located in Kansas can adjust to changing trends in the industry.\nIn addition to aircraft and telecoms, another industry that remains fundamentally\n\nimportant throughout the state is, of course, agriculture, in all facets of the industry. This\n\nincludes input supply and processing; famring and ranching; and, increasingly, biofuels. In\ngeneral, employment growth in agriculture-related industries is anticipated to be sluggish\n\n\fheading forward as fanning technologies and productivity continue to advance, although the\nrecent success of biofuels may provide some boost. While risks exist regarding the long-term\nviability of ethanol as an economic driver, the adaptation of traditional agricultural methods\n\nand expertise to new products and services may continue to present opportunities in many\n\nparts of Kansas and thus be opportunities for Kansas banks to grow and expand as well.\nThese might include other types of alternative energy, other high-value-added products, agri­\ntourism and the like.\n\nWhile aircraft manufacturing, telecommunications and agriculture will, in one way or\nanother, continue to largely define and drive the Kansas economy in the years ahead, there\nalso are a couple of other industries emerging as significant in the state. Though, as with the\n\nstate’s long-standing defining industries, there are risks to relying too heavily and focusing\ntoo much attention on specific industries, these industries could serve as potential anchors for\n\nfuture economic growth in some areas. As such, their recent developments and trends need to\nbe on the radar screens of Kansas bankers.\n\nThe first is biosciences, including ag product-related research and development, as\nwell as R&D related to human health, food and pharmaceuticals and animal health. As\n\nrecently at 1990, this industry had very little presence hi Kansas relative to the country as a\n\nwhole. But by 2005, it was more than twice as concentrated here as in the nation. It now\nemploys thousands and has begun to blossom in several places around the state. Although it\n\nhas been prominently located in Johnson County, where synergies with the Stowers Institute\nin Kansas City, Mo., are possible, activity has also emerged in or near most of the state’s\nlarger university towns—including Lawrence, Manhattan, Wichita and Hays. The\n\nbiosciences industry pays quite well (average earnings of $48,000 in 2005). and the outlook\n\n\fheading forward is generally bright. While activity is likely to continue to center around\n\ncollege towns or areas with large research institutions, the economic wealth created could\nbenefit many banks throughout the state.\nhi addition to biosciences, a second important emerging industry in Kansas is what is\n\ntermed office administrative services, and includes relatively high-tech back-office logistics,\npayroll, and other types of management support and consulting services. Like biosciences,\n\nthis industry is now more than twice as concentrated in Kansas as in the nation, and it pays\n\nrelatively well (also -$48,000). Although it is also currently located primarily in Johnson\n\nCounty, with advancing Internet technology, portions of this work could potentially be\n\nperformed in more remote areas looking for new sources ofjob growth. A key will be\n\nmaking sure these Kansas communities have access to the right kinds of telecommunications\ninfrastructure, as well as well-educated workers, a necessity for economic growth in general.\n\nSummary\nTo summarize, the Kansas economy, like the national economy and the economy of\n\nthe Tenth Federal Reseive District, has changed considerably over time and will continue to\n\nchange, both within its traditional industries and in new defining industries. While trends hi\n\naircraft manufacturing, telecommunications and agriculture will continue to play a sizable\nrole in the fate of the Kansas economy heading forward, new industries such as biosciences\n\nand back-office high-tech work may present solid opportunities for communities across the\n\nstate. Kansas bankers can thrive in this changing economic environment, but in order to do\nso, they need to be aware of trends in each of these industries and recognize the unique\n\nopportunities and risks they present for the state.\n\n\f"

            "content": "OKLAHOMA BANKS\nAND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITY\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nThe Oklahoma Bankers Association Annual Convention\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma\nJune 12, 2007\n\n\f2\n\nIt is a real pleasure for me to be here, and I want to thank you for the opportunity.\nThe Oklahoma Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nhave an important relationship. Banks provide a key link in the implementation of monetary\n\npolicy, and our relationship with the OBA is an important component in carrying out our\nresponsibilities for the macroeconomy and for financial stability. The connections between\nour organizations extend into other areas as well, ranging from the credit available through\nour discount window to the work of our bank examiners to our role in the payments system.\n\nWe know each other well and have for years.\n\nWhen times are good, as they are now, we might tend to take our strong connection for\n\ngranted. Today Fd like to reflect on our long working relationship: how it has worked\nduring stressful times in the past and its importance for the future. I will also outline several\n\nbanking issues we should be aware of even as we enjoy today’s very positive banking\n\nenvironment. Finally, I will briefly discuss the current banking conditions in Oklahoma.\n\nThe Oklahoma Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nFrom their beginnings, both the Oklahoma Bankers Association and the Federal\n\nReserve Bank of Kansas City have had a strong interest in serving their membership and the\npublic. The OBA had its start in June 1897 - 110 years ago this month -10 years before\nOklahoma became a state. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City opened in 1914 and\nour Oklahoma City Branch had its start in 1920.\nThere are many things I can mention in terms of a very positive relationship between\n\nOklahoma bankers and the Federal Reserve. Many of you have participated at our\n\nconferences, economic forums and regulatory updates. We have also had a supervisory\n\n\frelationship with nearly all of you, at either a bank or a holding company level. Moreover,\nOklahoma bankers, including some of you, have been important participants on our board of\n\ndirectors hi Kansas City and at our Oklahoma City Branch.\nOklahoma bankers, the OBA and Oklahoma legislators have also been very active in\n\nstate and national legislative issues, inc hiding many key pieces of legislation affecting the\n\nFederal Reserve.\nIn discussing the Federal Reserve’s connection to Oklahoma, I should mention first\n\nand foremost that the person who was responsible for writing much of the original Federal\n\nReserve Act was Robert Owen of Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.\nWithout his efforts, and those of several other key legislators from the Midwest, it is unlikely\nthat the Federal Reserve Act would have been passed in 1913 and that we would have the\ntype of central bank that we have today.\n\nOn a more personal level, I would also like to mention my long personal relationship\n\nwith Roger Beverage and Mick Thompson. They have been extremely helpful in providing\nme with their insights on Oklahoma banking and have been great to work with on a variety of\n\nbanking issues of importance to Oklahoma and our region.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Involvement in Supervision\n\nThe Federal Reserve derives many benefits from our cornrection with each of you.\n\nOur Oklahoma City Branch office gains insight on the regional economy by staying in\ncontact with bankers and local business leaders. We also place great importance on\nmaintaining our relationships through our role in supervision and payments.\n\n\f4\nIn the area of supervision, Federal Reserve Governor Don Kohn described the\n\nimportance of this connection in a recent speech, saying, “The Federal Reserve’s activities as\na bank supervisor provide us with important and sometimes critical information, expertise,\n\ncredibility and powers to both deter and manage financial crises.”\n\nFrom a personal and a very practical perspective, this supervisory experience and the\nresulting relationships with bankers on a regional level proved to be extremely helpfill to me\n\nand others at our Bank during the energy, real estate and agricultural collapses in the 1980s.\nThis was particularly true in Oklahoma as energy prices dropped dramatically. We\n\nrelied extensively on the firsthand knowledge gained through our supervisory responsibilities\n\nof major Oklahoma banking organizations. Tills knowledge provided us with an in-depth\nview into the Oklahoma economy and financial system - insight that proved to be of great\n\nimportance when our Bank was called upon to give its views on macroeconomic policy and\nto take steps to help maintain a stable financial system.\n\nWhile much of the rest of the country was still experiencing “boom-like” economic\nconditions, we were among the first regions to sound the alarm that the economy was not as\nstrong as some thought.\n\nIn one instance - the failure of Penn Square Bank here in Oklahoma City - we were all\nreminded that a seemingly small organization can have a substantial impact on the entire\n\nbanking system and that actions on a regional level can have important implications\nnationwide. Prior to its failure, Penn Square Bank had sold loan participations to eight of the\n50 largest banks in the country. These participations served as the initial impetus in the\n\nfailure of Continental Illinois National Bank in 1984, which was one of the 10 largest U.S.\n\n\f5\n\nbanks, and in Bank of America’s acquisition of Seattle First National Bank under a special\nWashington state failing-bank law.\n\nMany of the steps taken in Oklahoma in the 1980s also benefited from a close\n\nrelationship among the Federal Reserve, the Oklahoma Banking Department, the FDIC, the\nOCC and individual bankers in Oklahoma. This was a very stressfill time for everyone, and\n\none of my strong memories from that time was the effort by John Kirkpatrick to save Liberty\n\nNational Bank and keep it under local ownership. The commitment of John and a number of\notliers helped Liberty become one of only two major banks in Oklahoma and Texas not to\n\nfail or need FDIC assistance dining the 1980s. Such efforts were of critical importance in\nterms of providing a starting point for turning around the Oklahoma economy, maintaining\n\nfunding for many businesses here and encouraging investment in other banks, such as George\nKaiser’s willingness to support Bank of Oklahoma. These relationships and experience\n\nfurther made it clear to me that banking in the United States is best understood and mutmed\n\nat a regional level.\n\nThe Changing Banking Landscape and Financial Competition\nSince the 1980s, the banking landscape has changed quite dramatically, and all of you\n\nnow face a much different competitive environment. In this new environment, I would like\nto think the relationship to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City is as important and solid\nas ever.\nThere has been a significant trend toward consolidation. The number of banks\n\nnationwide, and in Oklahoma, has declined to about half the 1980 level. During this same\ntime period, the 10 largest banking organizations in the United States increased their share of\n\n\f6\ndomestic banking deposits from about 19 percent to more than 44 percent, Interstate banking\n\nhas also been an important factor in these consolidation trends, with banking organizations as\na group now holding nearly the same amount of deposits in other states as they hold within\n\ntheir home states. In Oklahoma, 27 percent of deposits are held by organizations\nheadquartered outside of the state.\n\nWhile there may be fewer banks hi Oklahoma, many of you are competing against\n\nlarger institutions, including a notable number headquartered outside of Oklahoma.\nMoreover, the total number of banking offices - main offices and branches combined - has\n\nrisen since 1980 by about two-thirds nationwide and somewhat more than that in Oklahoma.\n\nCompeting institutions have wider footprints in your markets. As a result, structural changes\nin banking, along with several other factors I’ll discuss next, are leading to a more intensely\n\ncompetitive environment - one that differs greatly from that ofjust a decade or two before.\nOn the lending side, a wide variety of factors are leading to more competitive credit\n\nmarkets. Financial information on borrowers is more readily available and at a much lower\n\ncost - both to bankers and to a wide range of nonbank lenders. At the same time, the cost of\n\nprocessing this loan data and making a loan has declined significantly, particularly with the\nadvent of credit scoring, automated underwriting systems and other data processing\n\nadvances. Loan customers can even be solicited over the internet, and funds are often\nextended with little or no personal contact.\nSecuritization is further bringing new investors into the marketplace, sometimes from\n\nall over the world, and increasing the volume of finds flowing into credit markets.\nSecuritization is also creating lenders who are largely originators and hold veiy few loans on\n\ntheir books at any time. In addition, new financial instruments, such as credit derivatives, are\n\n\f7\n\nallowing credit risk to be transferred to other parties - ideally, to those who are in the best\n\nposition to bear such risks.\n\nAn outgrowth of all these developments is an enormous expansion in the types of\n\nlenders and investors that serve credit markets, and, in turn, the creation of a much more\ncompetitive lending marketplace. These bends have birther brought down risk premiums,\nand the spread between high-yield or junk bonds and U.S. Treasury securities has now\n\ndropped to near historic lows.\nOn the deposit side, a rising interest rate environment has meant a higher cost of funds\nfor banks. Further adding to these funding costs is increased deposit competition. Hie\ninternet is greatly expanding the choices that depositors have for placing their money. Tocal\nbankers are also facing increasing competition from other sources. Many large banks, for\nexample, have rediscovered the benefits of retail banking and a broader office network,\n\nparticularly as competition drives down profitability in their other business lines. In addition,\n\na rising stock market and improving returns on other investments are now encouraging\ndepositors to move more funds into nonbank investment options.\n\nAs all of you are aware, these bends are driving up the cost of bank funding and\nbeginning to put pressure on bank net interest margins. Dining the past few years, increased\n\nreal estate and business lending have helped Oklahoma banks to maintain or increase\nprofitability in this more competitive environment and period of declining risk spreads.\nHowever, there are obvious limits to how far tills strategy can be taken without adversely\n\naffecting a bank’s risk exposure and potential loan losses. Thus, for all of you as Oklahoma\n\nbankers, an important question is, “How far can you go in this new environment and still\nmaintain profitable and safe banking operations?”\n\n\f8\n\nRisks and Responsibilities\nThe current performance of Oklahoma banks indicates that many of yon are meeting\nthe challenges of this changing landscape. Net income for Oklahoma banks has been at or\n\nnear record levels for the past few years. In fact, the average ROAA for Oklahoma banks\n\nwas 1.4 percent hi 2006, winch may very well be the highest ever achieved hi this state.\nOther measures of banking performance, such as loan growth, interest margins,\ncapital, nonperforming assets and loan losses have also remained at very favorable levels.\n\nBased on this performance, it would appear that a challenge many of you face as\nOklahoma bankers is not to become complacent and lose sight of the risks that are always\n\ninherent in your operations.\nIn this regard, I recently gave a speech titled, “This Time It’s Different (Or Is It?).”\n\nThe idea behind this speech was that some bankers are now telling us, as well as their\ndirectors and stockholders, not to wony about their current strategies.\nPart of their reasoning is that the marketplace has changed and that we are more\n\ncapable of measuring and controlling risk exposures. Many also suggest that the United\nStates economy has become much more stable, as based on our recent experience with\n\nseveral of the longest expansions on record and very mild recessions in between.\nIn some ways, though, this combination of great optimism, record bank earnings and\n\ndeclining risk spreads minors what we saw here in Oklahoma during the energy boom of the\n\n1970s and early 1980s. Back then, many Oklahoma bankers saw little reason to wony about\nrisk spreads since the price of oil could only go up.\n\nAnd indeed it did - for a while.\n\n\f9\n\nFrom $2.75 a barrel in 1973, oil prices rose to a peak of nearly $37 in 1981 before\ndropping all the way down to $10 in 1986. The optimism and rapid upward trend in oil\n\nprices made energy lending the hottest ticket in banking back then and ultimately contributed\n\nto previously mentioned collapses of Penn Square Bank, Continental Illinois and Sea-First.\n\nFor most of you, this is hardly new information. My point in drawing this quick\ncomparison is not that I think we will repeat what happened then, but I believe we need to be\na little careful at this point in the business and credit cycle. In my previous speech on this\ntopic, I ga ve a number of examples of bankers in the 1970s and 1980s who thought they were\n\nfollowing “foolproof’ strategies only to find there was something they should have been\nmuch more skeptical about. Eventually, some of today’s strategies will be tested under more\nstressful circumstances - subprime lending is a current example - and we will then find out\n\nhow “foolproof’ such strategies might be.\n\nSummary\n\nOne key to success for bankers is to be willing to ask the difficult questions about your\n\nbank’s operations and strategies: Is there anything that you should be more skeptical about?\nThese are the kinds of questions that bankers and central bankers should be asking as we\nmanage the present and prepare for the future. None of us can predict the future, my 30 years\nin banking and economics taught me that, but we can prepare for its uncertainty.\n\nI would assert that each of you is in the best position of anyone in the financial\nmarketplace to play this role, given your close customer relationships and the detailed\nknowledge and experience gamed through your daily banking operations.\n\n\f10\nFinally, to come full circle, I suggest that the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nand the Oklahoma Bankers must continue to pursue the common objectives of sound banking\nand a sound economy. Our staff are observing best, and worst, practices. We can provide\n\ninsight and help strengthen banking in Oklahoma. As Oklahoma bankers, you can greatly\nhelp the Federal Reserve as well, by sharing with us your valuable knowledge and personal\n\ninsights on the Oklahoma banking industry and the economy.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts on the current banking environment and to\ncontinue our banking and supervisory relationships.\n###\n\n\f"

            "content": "RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS\nAND PERSPECTIVES ON LONG-TERM GROWTH\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nCody, Wyoming\nJune 6, 2007\n\n\f2\n\nI am pleased to be in Cody today to speak with you about the prospects for the\nU.S. economy in the period ahead. As you know, the U.S. economy has been through a\ndifficult period over the past year, with slower economic growth and higher inflation. I\n\nam optimistic, however, that economic conditions will improve in coming months.\nIndeed, as the year progresses. I expect to see a notable pickup in economic growth, and I\n\nam hopefill that we will also see lower inflation. Realistically, though, there are some\nimportant risks to both outlook and inflation, and the path for monetary policy tills year\n\nwill depend importantly on how these risks play out.\n\nMoving beyond the near-term outlook, I would also like to discuss some\nsignificant challenges the U.S. economy will face over the longer term. In recent years,\nthe U.S. economy has performed very well, with strong growth in employment and\n\noutput coupled with low interest rates and inflation. However, the future may not be as\n\nrosy. Indeed, ongoing demographic changes combined with slower productivity growth\ncould lead to a reduction in the economy’s potential growth rate and make it more\n\ndifficult to continue to increase our living standards. These changes will pose important\nchallenges for policymakers during the next several decades.\n\nLet me begin with a closer look at recent economic conditions and the near-term\noutlook and then provide some perspectives on these longer term economic issues.\n\nRecent economic conditions\nDuring the past four quarters, the U.S. economy slowed considerably, with\ngrowth in real gross domestic product averaging less than 2 percent. This is well below\n\nthe economy’s estimated potential growth rate of around 3 percent. At the same time.\ninflation moved higher. Overall CPI inflation, measured on a 12-month basis, rose to\n\n\f3\nmore than 4 percent last summer before declining somewhat last fall. Core CPI, which\n\nremoves volatile food and energy prices, was close to 3 percent last summer and\ncurrently remains at 2.3 percent.\n\nThe slowdown in growth resulted primarily from weaker investment spending,\nboth residential construction and, more recently, business investment spending. The\nslump in housing, by itself, reduced GDP growth by a full percentage point over the past\nfour quarters. Indeed, absent the housing slowdown, the economy would have grown\n\nvery near potential last year.\n\nThe weakness in business investment spending resulted from several sources.\nSome of the weakness hi housing activity spilled over into business investment spending\nin industries that supply the housing market, hi addition, declining auto sales, caused by\n\nhigher energy prices, led to cutbacks in auto production and inventories. Business\n\nspending on new plant and equipment weakened as well, for reasons that are not entirely\nclear, but may reflect the general slowing in economic activity.\n\nAlthough there has been considerable talk in the media in recent months about the\npossibility of recession, such talk ignores some of the fundamental underlying strengths\nin the economy. In particular, even though investment has been weak, consumer\nspending, government spending, and exports have remained strong and have cushioned\n\nthe effects of weaker investment. Indeed, despite the slowdown in GDP growth, we\n\ncontinue to see solid job gains, and unemployment remains very low.\nWhen we look more closely at the recent behavior of inflation, we see two main\nfactors. First, higher energy prices last spring pushed up overall CPI inflation, and may\nhave spilled over into core inflation as well. When energy prices declined last fall, we\n\n\f4\nsaw considerable improvement in overall CPI inflation and a somewhat smaller\n\nimprovement in core inflation. The second key factor affecting inflation last year was a\n\nlarge increase hi the cost of homeownership, which was caused by the housing boom\n\nduring the past few years. After rising sharply last spring, increases in homeownership\ncosts have moderated, contributing to the slowing in inflation in recent months.\nThe near-term outlook\nTurning to the near-term outlook, most forecasters see a pickup in growth for the\nbalance of this year and some moderation in core inflation. I share tins outlook. Indeed,\n\nI believe growth is likely to average 2.5 percent to 3 percent over the balance of this year\nand turn in a similar performance next year.\n\nThis improvement comes from several sources, including: solid consumer\nspending, strong export growth and government spending, higher business inventory and\n\nfixed investment, and a diminishing drag from residential construction. Because growth\n\nis likely to remain below the economy’s potential growth rate, however, we may see\n\nunemployment rise somewhat by year-end. I also believe that we will see some gradual\nimprovement in core inflation, especially as homeownership costs continue to moderate.\nRealistically, however, there are some important risks to the outlook, and the\nanticipated pickup in growth may be delayed. Growth may not rebound quickly if the\n\nhousing slump turns out to be deeper or more prolonged than expected. As you know,\nmuch of the recent weakness in housing markets is due to the contraction in subprime\n\nlending. Many of the new home loans made in recent years were to borrowers who did\nnot qualify for conventional mortgage financing. And, a large number of these Ioans had\n\nfeatures, such as low teaser rates, short adjustment periods and interest-only payments,\n\n\f5\nthat made them vulnerable in a higher interest rate environment. Indeed, a rise in short­\n\nterm interest rates and reduced home price appreciation have made it difficult for some\nsubprime borrowers to continue to make mortgage payments or refinance their mortgage,\n\nleading to a rise in delinquencies and increased foreclosures.\n\nThese developments have caused highly publicized difficulties for some lenders\n\nspecializing in subprime lending and have resulted in some tightening of credit terms hi\nthe subprime sector. Moreover, hi the past few weeks, we have also seen some upward\npressure on conventional mortgage rates, which may put additional pressure on housing\n\nmarkets. Most forecasters believe it will be several more months before conditions\nstabilize and even longer before we see a housing recovery.\n\nAnother risk is that consumer spending may turn out weaker than anticipated.\nConsumer spending has been the primary engine of growth during the past several years.\nHowever, many consumers have been spending beyond their incomes by tapping into\n\nhome equity. With lower house price appreciation, this spendhig stimulus may diminish.\nWe have also seen somewhat weaker employment growth and retail spending in the past\n\nfew months, which may be a harbinger of weaker consumer spending going forward.\n\nThe recent uptick in energy prices may contribute to slower spending as well, especially\nfor autos.\nA third risk is that business investment spending may remain sluggish. Weak\n\ninvestment spending would not only result in lower economic growth in the near term but\ncould also reduce growth in productive capacity, leading to lower potential growth and\n\nhigher inflationary pressures over the long teim. I will have more to say about the\n\nconnections among investment, productivity and growth in a few minutes.\n\n\f6\nNot all of the growth risks are on the downside, however. Growth could be\nstronger than expected due to stronger exports and greater fiscal stimulus. Export growth\n\nwill benefit from the weaker dollar during the past several years as well as stronger\neconomic growth abroad. In fact, much of the recent improvement in manufacturing\n\nactivity, both in the Tenth District and nationally, is being driven by stronger export\n\norders. There is also likely to be significant fiscal stimulus coming from the improved\n\nbudget situation of state and local governments as well as continued strong defense\nspending.\n\nThere are also risks that inflation may not moderate as expected. Recently, we\n\nhave seen renewed strength in energy prices, which may pass through temporarily into\n\ncore inflation. In addition, there may be additional cost pressures corning from tight\nlabor markets, rising commodity input prices and the lower dollar. Of special concern is\n\nthe recent slowdown in labor productivity, which, if it continues, would lead to additional\n\ncost pressures in the future.\nAs to monetary policy in the period ahead, the Federal Reserve faces some\ndifficult decisions in balancing the risk of weaker growth against the risk of higher\n\ninflation. Irr my judgment, the current stance of policy, with a federal funds rate at 5 V*\n\npercent reflects an appropriate balancing of these opposing risks. I believe that the\n\ncurrent policy stance is somewhat restrictive and, if maintained, will bring core inflation\n\nback to acceptable levels over time. While I can envision a set of circumstances hr which\nthe fluids rate is lowered, I can just as easily see circumstances in which policy might\n\nneed to be tightened further. Consequently, any futur e change in the stance of policy will\nlikely depend on the evolution of the economy in the coming months.\n\n\f7\nLonger term growth and monetaiy policy challenges\n\nIn my remaining time here, I would like to shift from a discussion of the near­\n\nterm economic outlook to examine the longer run growth prospects for the U.S. economy.\nSpecifically, I would like to focus on some of the important factors that will determine\nour potential rate of growth in coming decades and the challenges they pose for monetaiy\n\npolicy.\nEconomists define potential output as the output that an economy can produce\nwith fully employed resources and with low and stable inflation. The growth in potential\n\noutput is a key determinant of how fast our living standards improve over time.\nCurrently, many economists believe that the potential growth rate of the U.S. economy\n\ncould slow over the next decade from current estimates of around 3 percent to 2 to 2 %\npercent. I would like to examine why this might happen and some of the difficulties this\n\ncould create.\nGrowth in potential output stems from two main sources: growth in the labor\n\nforce and growth in the productivity or the amount of output than can be produced per\n\nworker. Labor force growth depends mainly on demographic factors such as the size of\nthe working age population. Productivity growth depends on amounts of capital\n\nequipment, technology, and the education and skills of the labor force. Forecasts of\nslower growth in potential output are based primarily on estimates of a sizable slowdown\nhi labor force growth and partly on estimates of declining productivity growth over the\n\nnext several years. To see what lies behind these projections, let me take a closer look at\nthese two factors.\n\n\f8\nLaborforce growth\n\nThe projected slowing of labor force growth is largely based on the anticipated\nretirement of baby boomers over the next decade. It also reflects a continuation of the\nlower labor force participation rates of younger age groups in recent years. As you know,\npopulation aging is not unique to the United States. Most industrialized countries and\n\neven some developing countries, such as China, will experience rapid population aging\nand lower labor force growth in corning decades.\n\nThr ee factors might mitigate the expected slowing of the labor force. One\npossibility is that many workers may postpone retirement. In fact, we have seen some\n\nsigns of increasing labor force participation rates for older age groups hr recent years. In\naddition, increased shortages of labor could lead to rising wages and increased\n\nparticipation rates for those not currently in the labor force.\nHowever, the largest factor is likely to be the role that immigration plays hr labor\nforce growth. Immigration has been an increasingly important part of the labor force in\n\nrecent years and potentially could make up a significant portion of the expected shortfall\nin labor force due to population aging. However, recent immigrants have generally had\n\nless education and job skills than the overall labor force and so would need significant\nimprovement hr these areas to be as productive as other workers.\n\nProductivity trends\n\nWhile some slowing of labor force growth is inevitable, the outlook for\nproductivity growth is much less certain. As we look back over the past several decades,\n\nwe see both periods of strong productivity growth and periods of weak productivity\ngrowth. During the 1960s and early 1970s, for example, growth of output per hour in the\n\n\f9\nnonfarm business sector averaged a strong 2.8 percent. Then, from the mid-1970s to the\nmid-1990s, productivity growth dropped by half to only 1.4 percent. Corresponding to\nthis slowdown in productivity growth was a significant slowing hi the growth of potential\n\noutput to around 2 percent to 2 14 percent.\nBeginning hi the mid-1990s and continuing to 2004, however, productivity\n\ngrowth rebounded to around 2.9 percent, and estimates of potential growth increased to 3\nto 3 XA percent. Economists have attributed much of this surge in productivity to business\n\ninvestments in information and telecommunications technology.\nMore recently, we have once again experienced much lower productivity growth.\n\nSince 2005, productivity growth has averaged only 1.8 percent. It is tins recent slowing\nthat is starting to concern policymakers because, if it continues, it could exacerbate the\n\nreduction in potential output growth coming from slower labor force growth.\n\nAs I noted earlier, productivity growth is closely tied to factors such as the\namounts and types of capital workers use as well as the skills that workers apply to then\n\njobs. Worker skills, of course, depend on education and on-the-job training. The\nquantity of capital goods and the technology incorporated in those goods depends\n\nprimarily on research and development and investment decisions made by firms. The\nrecent weakness in business investment spending that I discussed earlier is potentially\n\nworrisome because it could exacerbate the recent productivity slowdown and so lead to\nslower growth in potential output over the longer run.\n\nChallenges for monetary policy\n\nLet me conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of these developments\nfor monetary policy. To begin, it is important to recognize what monetary policy can and\n\n\f10\ncannot do with regard to growth in potential output. Monetary policy can play a major\n\nrole in assuring that the economy operates close to its potential. For example, the Federal\nReserve can push interest rates up to head off inflationary pressures when the economy is\n\noperating above potential. And, the Fed can push rates down to provide economic\nstimulus when the economy is operating below its potential.\n\nTo be effective in stabilizing the economy, however, policymakers must have a\nreasonably accurate measure of the economy’s potential growth. Without this\n\ninformation, there is the risk that policy could be unnecessarily tight if potential growth is\n\nunderestimated or too inflationary if potential growth is overestimated. In fact, some\neconomists attribute the surge hr inflation dining the 1970s to policymakers’ failure to\nrecognize the slowdown in productivity growth and potential growth that I discussed\n\nearlier. Consequently, the behavior of productivity and potential growth over the next\nfew years could have important implications for monetary policy.\n\nFinally, it is important to recognize that while monetary policy can help provide\n\nshort-run economic stability, it cannot affect the rate of potential output growth directly.\nAs we have seen, the economy’s potential growth rate depends mainly on demographic\nfactors and productivity. Monetary policy can influence potential growth indirectly by\nproviding a stable, noninflationary economic environment. Such an environment reduces\n\nuncertainty about the economic outlook. In doing so, it provides a more favorable\nframework for households to plan their lifetime savings and spending decisions and for\n\nbusinesses to make long-term investment decisions. And, as businesses are encouraged\nto pursue research and development and introduce new technology, productivity and\n\npotential growth increase. Thus, by providing an environment of economic stability and\n\n\fprice stability in the short nm, monetary policy can contribute to the economy’s potential\n\ngrowth in the longer term.\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nBasel Capital Standards:\nImplementation and Challenge\nSSI Program\nCape Town, South Africa\nFebruary 5, 2007\n\n\fIt is a pleasure to be here with you today.\nWe are in a period of revolutionary change in the financial industry that is greatly\ninfluencing the way banks and financial institutions operate.\n\nThe financial industry is becoming much more diverse, hr the United States, for instance,\n\nsome banks—typically smaller banks—continue to specialize in traditional deposit and loan\nactivities. Others—usually larger banking organizations—now engage in a far more complex set\n\nof financial services, including trading, clearing, and other securities and capital markets\nactivities. Many of these activities are further conducted on a global basis. I imagine there are\n\nsimilar differences hr the financial industries of many African nations where the branches of very\nlarge foreign banks are operating in the same markets as local banks.\n\nTills growing diversity among financial institutions, combined with rapid techno logical\n\ninnovation and financial deregulation, is having a profound effect on the regulatoiy and\nsupervisory framework. A key question for us, as bank supervisors, is how can we respond to\nthese changes in a manner that ensures a safe and sound banking system without undermining\n\nthe industry’s ability to innovate.\n\nBanking supervisors worldwide are having to move toward a more risk-focused\nsupervisory framework that looks at the effectiveness of the risk management process, hi\n\naddition, supervisors are grappling with the issue of how they can best tailor regulations to a\n\ndiverse group of institutions without giving a competitive advantage or imposing regulatoiy\nburdens unevenly. An important example of such a challenge is the Basel II Capital Standards\n\nand the approaches that countries are now taking to implement it.\nMy goal here is to make you aware of important elements of the Basel II implementation\n\nin the United States. As part of tills I’ll describe various related steps we are taking to establish a\n\n1\n\n\fworkable capital framework for banks that do not engage in significant international or\nnontraditional activities. To give yon the broadest understanding of our process, it will be helpfill\n\nto review how our financial system and its supervision have changed in recent years. These\nchanges have led to greater diversity among individual institutions and a transition to a more\n\nrisk-based supervisory framework.\nBasel II, to be successfill, requires a good risk-based capital program. To be fully\nsuccessful, it must also rely on strong supervision and market discipline—as reflected in part by\n\nPillars 2 and 3 of the Basel framework. It is the combination of capital standards, supervisory\n\noversight and public disclosure that will allow a risk-based capital and supervisory program to\nsucceed.\n\nFinancial market developments in recent years\n\nThe world is experiencing a rapid evolution of its financial markets. Innovations in\ntechnology and finance have greatly lowered the cost of financial transactions, while\n\ndramatically increasing global communication and access to financial information.\n\nThe implications are enormous. Banks no longer operate within a segmented financial\nsystem, which had previously limited competition among banks, thrifts, credit unions, securities\n\nfirms, insurance companies and the capital markets. As a result, each of these industries is\nexpanding, causing banks and other financial institutions to face new and growing competition.\nMeanwhile, lower costs for information, transactions and data processing have combined\nwith applied financial theory to open the door to new and complex financial instruments and\n\nbetter ways to manage risk. Examples include derivatives, securitized assets, and new risk\nmanagement models and systems. For banks—particularly larger banks—these changes have\n\n2\n\n\fmeant less need to hold and fund assets on their own balance sheets, a more accurate means for\nmeasuring and managing risk exposures, and new ways of lending, using such tools such as\n\ncredit scoring and the internet. These same developments are further enabling capital and\n\nfinancial markets to fulfill some of the same roles as banks in funding the credit and investments\nneeds of households and businesses.\nA final effect of technological innovation is to make financial intermediation more of a\nglobal activity. With lower communication and information costs, banks can extend their\n\ninternational financial activities and follow individual films as their business needs become more\nglobal in scope.\n\nResulting changes in the supervisory and regulatory system\n\nIn the United States, significant changes in the supervisory and regulatory system have\n\nbeen required to keep up with these marketplace developments. Previous regulatory restrictions,\nsuch as deposit interest ceilings, limits on permissible banking activities and constraints on\ngeographical expansion, have proven unworkable or ill-advised in this changing financial\nenvironment. As a result, substantial deregulation has occurred. Banks and other financial\ninstitutions now have much greater latitude in deciding what products they can offer, how they\n\nprice them and how they can expand their business.\n\nFor U.S. banking supervisors, these changes mean less reliance is placed on rules and\nrestrictions in ensuring a safe and sound banking system. For larger banks that are heavily\ninvolved in transactional activities through their hading, clearing and derivatives operations,\n\nsupervisory review of current balance sheet positions provides only limited insight into a bank’s\n\nrisk exposure. In response to tills changing banking environment, supervisors are developing a\n\n3\n\n\fmore risk-focused supervisory framework. They are giving greater emphasis to the unique\n\ncharacteristics of each bank and to the processes, management information systems and internal\ncontrols that a bank has in place to manage and control its risk exposure.\n\nA second implication of this financial revolution is that supervisors must interact with a\n\nmuch more diverse group of banks. Although all banks have seen technology and financial\ninnovation greatly change their operations, the more significant changes are occurring at the\n\nlarger U.S. banking organizations. Examples include the development of complex financial\ninstruments; entry into securities, insurance, trading and other capital markets activities; more\n\nsophisticated risk management practices; and expansion of global financial activities. The wider\n\nrange of products being offered by financial institutions and the merging of banking, securities\n\nand insurance activities is also leading to the growing importance of large bank and financial\nholding companies. This development is shifting more risk management practices to the parent\ncompany level and thereby increasing the importance of consolidated supervision.\n\nThe growing diversity among financial institutions requires regulators to take a\n\nmultifaceted approach to supervision and regulation by designing provisions that reflect the\nunderlying risks and are either limited in their coverage or apply only to a particular group of\n\nbanks. Examples of targeted supeivision in the United States include examination frequencies,\n\nbank holding company inspections, internal audit standards and the Basel capital requirements\nthemselves.\n\nThe role of Basel II in this environment\n\nFor bankers, investors and regulators, a critical step hi this new environment is to bring a\nbank’s capital into a closer relationship with its risk exposure. Since its adoption, the Basel I\n\n4\n\n\fframework has helped to provide some fairly broad adjustments in capital standards for credit\n\nrisk and, more recently, market risk. However, the Basel I risk weights fail to address significant\ndifferences in the quality of individual assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. Consequently,\n\nbanks have been required to put the same amount of capital behind their highest and their lowest\n\nquality loans—a feature of Basel I that makes it costly to keep better assets on the balance sheet\nand provides incentives to arbitrage this capital framework.\nComplex financial instruments also have made the simpler Basel I standards more\n\ndifficult to implement. Basel I, for instance, fails to take advantage of the substantial progress\n\nand advances some banks have made in then internal credit rating systems, financial models and\neconomic capital calculations.\n\nBecause of the need to have capital standards reflect these advances, the United States is\nin the process of adopting Basel II and, in some instances, Basel IA. For the largest banks in the\n\nUnited States, the goal at this time is to adopt the advanced (internal ratings-based) approach in\nBasel II rather than the standardized or the foundation internal ratings-based approaches. The\n\nadvanced approach would apply to core banking organizations—those with consolidated assets\nof $250 billion or more, or with consolidated on-balance-sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion\nor more. Other U.S. banking organizations—opt-in banks—could voluntarily adopt the advanced\nBasel II standards, provided they receive approval from their regulators after submitting detailed\n\nimplementation plans.\nNine U.S. banks have been identified as core or mandatory Basel II banks, and another 10\n\nto 15 banks are expected to be voluntary opt-in banks. Current plans are for these banks to\n\ncomply with the advanced measurement approach for operational risk. However, and\n\n5\n\n\fnoteworthy, our recent request for public comments asks for views on whether large banks\nshould be able to use the other credit and operational risk alternatives in Basel II.\n\nOur implementation of Basel II will be phased in over a number of years to give banks\nand the markets time to learn and adjust to the new standards. Full implementation of Basel II for\n\nU.S. banks may not be until 2012 at the earliest. While U.S. regulators have concerns that this\ndelayed implementation will put U.S. banks behind some of their international counterparts, we\nwant to make sure that banks maintain adequate capital levels while implementing their risk\nmodels and transitioning to Basel II.\n\nI mentioned Basel LA a moment ago. This approach would be available to banks that are\nnot far enough along in then credit rating systems and models to adopt the Basel II standards.\nOne of the intentions behind Basel IA is to keep these banks from being put at a capital\n\ndisadvantage when competing in the same loan markets as Basel II adopters.\nThis alternative approach would allow a greater variety of risk weights compared to\nBasel I. For instance, Basel IA would allow a range of risk weights for residential mortgages\n\nbased on loan-to-vahre ratios and possibly the borrower’s credit history. Other proposed aspects\nof Basel IA include gr eater use of external credit ratings to set risk weights and lower risk\n\nweights for small business Ioans guaranteed by owners and collateralized by business assets.\nBanks not electing to use Basel IA could continue to use Basel L unless regulators decide\n\nthat the organization’s risk profile would not be captured adequately by the existing standards.\nThese Basel I banks would presumably be those that already hold capital in excess of the\n\nstandards and don’t want to be burdened with the cost of shifting to a new capital framework.\nThe combined framework of Basel I, IA and II consequently reflects the view that a “one\nsize fits all” approach to capital won’t work very well in today’s diverse banking environment.\n\n6\n\n\fRather than relying on one capital framework that would be too burdensome for smaller banks or\ntoo simplistic to capture risk exposures at larger institutions, U.S. supervisors will be taking a\nmore varied approach.\n\nCapital ratios aren’t enough\n\nThe role of overseeing the safety and soundness of financial institutions necessarily\ninvolves much more than calculating capital levels and implementing capital standards. Basel II\n\nitself, in fact, recognizes that numerical capital standards aren’t enough and, accordingly,\nincludes Pillars 2 and 3. These two pillars establish a framework for ensuring that supervision\nand market discipline have an appropriate role hi the risk-based capital process.\n\nBeyond this role in reinforcing capital standards, risk-based supervision and marketplace\n\ndiscipline fillfill an even broader and more essential role in directing the actions of financial\ninstitutions toward a stable financial environment.\n\nA new supervisory framework and increased market discipline should be regarded as\nessential elements as we develop a more risk-based approach to both bank capital and banking\noversight. Risk-based supervision will have to replace the more restrictive banking rules of the\n\npast. Additionally, markets, in fulfilling their established role of allocating resources, will have\n\nto pass judgment on acceptable bank capital and risk levels.\nWith regard to bank supervision, there is no question supervisors need to review and\nassure banks of all sizes accurately measure, manage and report the risks they assume. In the\n\ntransition to a more risk-based capital and supervisory framework, an accurate picture of a\nbank’s major assets and risk exposures will be of central importance, with this picture based\n\nincreasingly on a bank’s internal credit and risk analysis. Consequently, bank supervisors will\n\n7\n\n\fneed to work with banks and their management to ensure that a bank's current systems and\npractices are adequate and capable of accurately informing the market of its financial and\n\noperating position. As reflected by Basel IA and II in the United States, risk-based supervision\nwill need to be tailored to the individual bank and its activities, but the basic objective remains\nthe same—ensuring a safe, sound and competitive banking system.\n\nMarket discipline and public disclosure—as reflected hi Basel K’s Pillar 3—are\nimportant tools a country and its banking supervisors can use to reinforce a risk-based approach\nto supervision and capital standards. In many instances, market discipline and disclosure provide\nthe most effective way to encourage bank management to pursue sound policies and make any\n\nneeded changes, especially at the world’s largest banks. Financial deregulation has clearly\n\nelevated the role of market discipline in allocating financial resources and ensuring sound\nbanking conditions. A number of recent studies, in fact, have concluded that weaknesses in\nmarket discipline have contributed to many of the recent financial crises.\n\nUnder the Basel capital standards, market discipline and public disclosure have a critical\n\nrole to play. For market discipline to be effective in this process, investors and depositors must\nhave the necessary information and the confidence to make decisions about which financial\ninstitutions are deserving of their funds. At the heart of this market process, banks will need to be\n\nopen about their risk exposures, the adequacy of their risk measuring and management practices,\nand then capital decisions. In turn, supervisors will have to take a strong position in ensuring that\nbank disclosures are accurate and complete.\nDisclosure and transparency will be of significant value in other aspects of the Basel\n\nimplementation process as well. In this regard, the quantitative impact studies that have been\n\nconducted for Basel II have shown a substantial variation across banks in their calculations of\n\n8\n\n\frequired capital. Variation is also likely to occur over the credit cycle, depending on how long of\n\na period banks use to calculate default and loss probabilities. Other differences will exist\n\ninternationally as countries implement Basel II. All these differences will be difficult to resolve\nif bank investors, creditors and private credit rating agencies don’t have the basic information\n\nneeded to draw hidependent decisions.\n\nFor emerging market countries, disclosure and transparency will be especially important\nin the transition to a more risk-based supervisory and Basel capital framework. Sound accounting\npractices and timely and accurate identification of credit problems will be necessary for a risk­\n\nbased approach, whether capital or supervisory, to work. Moreover, a country and its financial\nmarkets must ensure that institutions disclose accurate and material information about their\n\nperformance, credit quality and overall condition. As central bankers and supervisors, many of\nyou will undoubtedly have to play a critical role in improving public disclosure and\ntransparency, especially as you continue developing your supervisory frameworks and oversight\n\nof financial markets.\n\nSummary\n\nThe implementation of Basel II reflects the advances that are occurring hr banking—both\nin terms of technological change and the progress banks are making in their own risk\nmanagement systems. Basel II is also serving as a reminder of the growing diversity of banks\n\nwithin individual countries and across countries. One result of this changing financial\n\nenvironment is to make a risk-based approach to capital requirements more essential, particularly\nas countries deregulate their financial markets and remove provisions that once served to limit\n\nrisk taking.\n\n9\n\n\fHowever, I want to reemphasize that just making a commitment to more risk-based\ncapital standards will not be enough.\n\nFor new capital standards and the remainder of our supervisory framework to be\neffective, we will also have to take a risk-focused approach to our supervision. In this approach,\nwe must ensure that the major risks at individual financial institutions are identified and that\nthese institutions are taking the necessary steps to manage their risk exposures. In addition, we\n\nneed to promote greater market discipline and disclosure for financial institutions, thus bringing\nbank investors and creditors in as a more effective force in directing the actions of banks and\nbank management.\n\nOverall, we will need to strike the proper balance in this changing financial enviromnent\namong the numerical calculations of Basel IL the use of risk-focused supervision and the\n\ndiscipline provided by the marketplace. All of these factors must be designed to reinforce each\nother and address the variety of risks that different institutions incur.\n\n10\n\n\f"

            "content": "THE NATIONAL. ECONOMY AND MONETARY POLICY IN 2007\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nKansas City, Missouri\nJanuary 19, 2007\n\n\f2\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the outlook for the U.S. economy\nin 2007 and the implications for monetary policy in the period ahead. The him of the\n\nyear is traditionally a time to look back at the events of the past year and to look forward\n\nto the prospects for the new year. In the distant past soothsayers peered into a crystal\nball to deliver their prognostications. Nowadays, economists use computers. But, despite\n\nthe increased sophisticatioir of the forecasting instrument, the economic outlook is\ninherently uncertain, and there are always risks that the economy may perforin differently\n\nthan expected.\n\nWith that caution, then, what does our high-tech crystal ball tell us about 2007?\nOverall, the economy should continue to improve with stronger growth and lower\n\ninflation. However, there are at least two major risks that could cloud the scene. The\nfirst of these is the housing market, where a substantial adjustment in housing activity\nand home price appreciation is underway. Although there are some signs that housing\nmay be bottoming out, weaker residential investment and related spillover effects on\n\nconsumer spending remain a downside risk to the near-term outlook for economic\n\ngrowth.\n\nThe second risk is that tight labor markets or a resurgence in energy prices could\nexacerbate inflationary pressures. Last year’s solid employment growth brought the\nunemployment rate down to a very low level, and labor cost pressures could build if labor\n\nmarkets tighten further. There is also the ever-present risk that recent energy price\ndeclines could be reversed, leading to a less favorable outlook for inflation in the coming\nyear.\n\n\f3\nLet me spend the next few minutes providing more detail to this general outlook,\nand then I’ll close with comments on its implications for monetary policy.\nA quick look back\nTo provide some perspective on the outlook, it may be helpful first to look back at\n\nsome of the key economic developments in 2006. Last year, real GDP grew near its trend\nrate of about 3 percent, but the growth rate slowed notably over the course of the year.\nGrowth in the second half of 2006 likely averaged around 2 percent to 2.5 percent at an\n\nannual rate, about half the average rate of the fir st half of the year.\nMuch of the softening in growth last year can be attributed to weaker housing\nmarket activity and lower automotive production. Some analysts feel these sectors were\n\nunsustainably strong earlier in the expansion, and now they may be adjusting back toward\nmore sustainable levels. In addition, past increases in interest rates have slowed housing\n\nactivity, and higher energy prices earlier in the year hurt auto sales. Housing and autos\n\nalso affect a broad network of industrial suppliers, causing a slowdown in several\nmanufacturing and materials industries. But, there is little evidence so far that the\nsoftness in housing and autos has spilled over to other parts of the economy, especially\nconsumer spending.\n\nEmployment grew fast enough last year to keep labor market conditions relatively\ntight. The civilian unemployment rate drifted down by 0.5 percentage point over the year\n\nto 4.5 percent in December. Although this unemployment rate is below most estimates of\nthe full-employment rate, recent reports on labor costs are mixed, with some hinting at\nincreased labor cost pressures while others remain fairly steady.\n\n\f4\nPartly because of higher energy prices in the first part of 2006, cons tuner price\ninflation was higher last year than I would find acceptable over the long term. The core\n\nCPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 2.6 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nCore inflation was even higher than that in the spring and summer of 2006, but\nmoderated somewhat at year's end as growth slowed and energy prices declined.\n\nA look ahead at 200\"\n\nLooking into 2007, we are likely to see some important shifts in the traj ectories\nfor growth and inflation. Although real GDP growth slowed over the last year, I expect\n\nto see a recovery in growth in 2007 back toward trend. And, I expect to see core\nconsumer price inflation gradually recede from last year’s unacceptably high rate.\nIn my view, real GDP growth is likely to rise gradually from 2 percent to 2.5\n\npercent annually in the second half of last year to around 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 2007.\n\nThe gradual recovery in growth will reflect several factors. First, the drag on growth\nfrom the housing market should diminish by mid-year as housing markets stabilize.\nSecond, the spillover effects from housing on consumer spending should continue to be\nrelatively small and be offset by such other factors as solid employment and labor income\n\ngr owth. And third, tire more favorable energy price developments in the second half of\n2006 have raised households’ discretionary income and boosted their willingness to\n\nspend.\n\nFinancial conditions also remain favorable for growth. The more restrictive\nstance of monetary policy over the recent past has helped contain long-term inflation\n\nexpectations and helped hold long-term interest rates relatively low. Moreover, these\n\n\f5\nactions have set a favorable background for the stock market, which posted strong gams\nlast year.\n\nFavorable financial conditions and strong profit growth should encourage further\nsolid gains in business investment, which are likely to offset some of the continuing\n\nweakness in housing. In addition, international trade should be less of a drag on\neconomic growth this year, and perhaps even a contributor to growth. The temporary\n\nslowing of growth is helping hold down imports, and past depreciation of the dollar has\nmade our products more competitive in world markets.\n\nSolid foreign economic growth will also encourage stronger gains in U.S. exports\nthis year. Although world growth may moderate somewhat from last year's pace, the\n\nconsensus outlook is that world growth will remain more than 3 percent. Moreover,\ngrowth will likely remain strong in many emerging markets. For example, growth in\nChina is projected to be almost 10 percent, and Indian growth could be near 8 percent.\n\nLast year’s decline in energy prices has supported foreign demand, helping balance world\ngrowth by making it less dependent on U.S. impoils.\n\nWith our real GDP only gradually rising toward trend this year, labor market\n\npressures should moderate somewhat iu the first half of the year. Although I do not\nexpect large changes in the unemployment rate, we could see the unemployment rate\n\nmove back toward 5 percent over the course of the year.\n\nAs to the inflation outlook, most forecasters expect some moderation of the\ninflation rate in 2007. Past monetary policy actions combined with moderate economic\n\ngrowth and stable energy price pressures should contribute to a reduction in both the\noverall and core inflation rates.\n\n\f6\nRecent inflation readings seem largely consistent with this expectation, hi\n\nparticular, core CPI inflation has slowed noticeably in the last few months. For example,\nthe three-month average inflation rate for core CPI fell from a high of 3.8 percent last\n\nMay to 1.4 percent in December. The 12-month average has shown less improvement,\n\nfalling from a high of 2.9 percent in September to 2.6 percent in December. I share the\nview that core consumer price inflation is likely to moderate from last year’s high level,\nand I think that we will continue to see stable long-term inflation expectations.\n\nRisks to the outlook for growth and inflation\n\nAs always, there are many uncertainties in the outlook, so let me turn, now, to a\ndiscussion of some of the major risks to economic growth and inflation.\n\nThe housing market\n\nThe housing risk is foremost in the minds of many homeowners and home\nbuilders right now. Some observers have warned for some time that the housing market\n\nwas overheated. Over the past several years, there was a rapid increase in home prices\nfueled partly by low mortgage rates. The increase in household wealth from home price\n\nappreciation also helped sustain strong consumption growth in the current expansion.\nClearly, we have now seen a substantial cooling in housing market activity in\n\nmost parts of the country. Single-family housing starts have dropped about 25 percent\nfrom a year ago, and both new- and existing-home sales have declined sharply.\nMoreover, the slowdown in home sales and the increased inventory of unsold\nhomes have dr amatically reduced the rate of home price appreciation. The Office of\n\nFederal Housing Enterprise Oversight’s national home price index rose at a 3.5 percent\nannual rate in the third quarter of 2006, which is down substantially from a 12 percent\n\n\f7\nrate hi the last quarter of 2005. And, some areas of the country, where house prices were\nmost elevated, have experienced substantial price declines.\n\nThe slowing in the housing market has direct and indirect effects on the economy.\nLess home construction means fewer jobs for construction workers and fewer building\n\nmaterials purchased. Moreover, the reduced appreciation in home values may have\nimportant indirect effects by lowering the growth rate of household wealth and the ability\n\nof households to easily tap into past wealth gains. In recent years, many homeowners\nhave used their home equity to finance strong consumption growth through mortgage\n\nrefinancing or home equity loans.\n\nThe risk of a sharper-than-predicted slowdown in residential investment and\nfalling home prices cannot be dismissed entirely. Policymakers will need to monitor the\n\nsituation carefully, both in terms of the state of the housing market and its broader\neconomic effects.\n\nBut, there are also some good reasons to think that the adjustment in the housing\nmarket may be more moderate going forward. We are already seeing some signs that the\n\nhousing market may be near the bottom. Housing starts and home sales have increased\nsomewhat from their lows in 2006, and home builders' attitudes and mortgage\n\napplications to purchase a home are no longer plummeting. Underlying this more\npositive tone are fairly low mortgage rates and strong labor market conditions, although\n\nsome of the improvement may also reflect mild weather at the end of last year.\nMoreover, continued income and employment growth and high levels of stock\n\nmarket wealth will help to cushion any adverse effects of the weaker housing market on\nconsumer spending. I do not mean to say that we could not see further weakness in\n\n\f8\nhousing activity and prices, but the evidence at this point suggests that the housing\n\nmarket adjustment is unlikely to derail the broader economic expansion.\nLabor markets and energy prices\n\nThere are also factors which pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. Strong\n\nlabor market conditions could result in cost pressures that are passed on to consumer\n\nprices. In addition, disruptions to energy supplies could result in renewed strength hi\n\nenergy prices.\nDespite the slowdown in overall economic activity in 2006, employment growth\nremained solid. Payroll employment growth averaged about 150,000 jobs per month hi\n2006, and the unemployment rate declined over the course of the year. Growth in service\nand government jobs offset weakness in manufacturing and construction.\nhi reviewing these data, I would note that one reason labor markets have remained\nrelatively tight is that the labor force has not been growing as fast as in the past.\n\nDemogr aphic factors, such as the aging of the baby-boom generation and the smaller size\n\nof the following generations, are part of the explanation. Also, the labor force\nparticipation rate of women has stabilized after trending upward for many years\nRecent research conducted at our Bank suggests the trend growth rate for\n\nemployment over the next 10 years may be around 120,000 jobs per month. Thus, it\nshould not be too surprising that last year's employment growth has kept labor market\n\nconditions fairly tight.\n\nThe tight labor market conditions have put some pressure on labor costs. For\nexample, growth of unit labor costs has drifted upward over the last couple of years. This\n\nincrease partly reflects stronger gains hi compensation per hour. Compensation growth\n\n\f9\n\nwas particularly strong in the first quarter of last year when some employees received\nexceptionally large bonuses. Faster growth of unit labor costs also reflected weaker\n\nproductivity gains in 2006 as real GDP growth fell below trend.\nShould these recent trends in compensation and productivity continue, there is a\nrisk that businesses may be under pressure to raise prices. Although a risk, there are\n\nforces in play that may restrain increased labor cost pressures from contributing to a rise\nin inflation in 2007. Some companies, for example, may absorb increased cost pressures\n\ntlnough reduced profit margins rather than raise prices and risk losing valued customers.\nIn addition, productivity growth should rebound in 2007 because of strong business\n\ninvestment and the continued adoption of new technologies. And, there is no evidence\nyet, at least, that labor market tightness is fostering an inflationary psychology.\nA second immediate risk to the inflation outlook is that we could see a resurgence\n\nof energy prices in 2007. The decline in energy prices during the second half of 2006 and\nso far this year is a welcome development as it helps to lower short-term inflation\n\npressures while providing support to consumer spending.\nHowever, many analysts view the recent energy price declines as resulting from a\nmore favorable short-run supply situation rather than longer run fundamentals. In\n\nparticular, these analysts attribute the recent weakness in energy prices to a combination\n\nof higher-than-nonnal inventories coupled with a more benign fall hurricane season,\nunusually warm weather earlier hi the whiter, and the absence of major geopolitical\n\ndisruptions in supply. Thus, there is a risk that price pressures could reemerge if the\nsupply situation worsens in an environment of steadily increasing world energy demand.\n\nMonetary policy in 2007\n\n\f10\n\nLet me close with some discussion on the outlook for monetary policy hi the\nperiod ahead, hi doing so, I am not in a position to speculate about the future course of\npolicy. Instead, I hope to convey some of my thinking about the factors that will shape\nthe Federal Open Market Committee’s decisions hi the period ahead.\nIn my opinion, there has been a discrepancy lately between the views of FOMC\nmembers, as summarized in the Committee’s public statements, and the views of many\n\nfinancial market participants. Although there is a wide range of views in the market,\nsome participants have jumped to the conclusion that monetary policy will be eased in the\nnear future. Surveys of financial market economists show that many expect an eashig in\nmonetary policy sometime this year, hi addition, the yield curve and financial futures\n\nprices incorporate some expected easing of monetary policy later this year.\nIn contrast, the FOMC has continued to express its concern about the upside\n\ninflation risks. After its last meeting on Dec. 12, the FOMC stated that “some inflation\nrisks remain,” and that the “extent arid timing of any additional finning” would depend\n\non how incoming data affected the outlook for growth and inflation.\nIn my view, the easing of monetary policy that market participants expect would\n\nbe appropriate only if inflation clearly subsided from recent elevated levels, and if the\n\nincoming data implied the inflation outlook would remain favorable in the future. And,\nof cotu'se, it would depend too on the growth path of the economy itself, hi my\n\njudgment, it is premature to conclude that current conditions define a clear path for\npolicy. Although recent inflation reports have been encouraging, the inflation rate over\nthe last 12 months remains higher than I would find acceptable for the long term. And, as\n\n\f11\n\nI suggested earlier, upside inflation risks still exist from possible labor market pressures\nor higher energy prices.\n\nAs economic data accumulate over the next few months. I suspect some of the\ncurrent uncertainty will dissipate, and we will have a clearer view of the monetary policy\npath going forward.\n\n\f"

            "content": "This Time It’s Different\n(Or Is It?)\n\nRemarks By\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nWestern States Bank Directors Education Foundation\nTucson, AZ\nOctober 30, 2006\n\n\fThose of you with several year's of business experience in this part of the country may\nrecognize that many of the things we are hearing today about the economy have\ncounterparts in the past: Asset values are appreciating, farmland values are strong and we\nare all well-aware of what has occurred this year with the energy markets. In short, for\n\nmany hr this area of the country, times are good.\n\nAt the start of the 1980s, we were told that oil prices could only go higher,\nfarmland was a solid investment because, “they aren’t making any more of it,” and\n\nhousing and stock markets would continue to climb.\n\nOf course, if you were involved in busmess or banking 20 years ago, you will\nrecall that several of the financial decisions made on those speculative forecasts created\n\ntheir own sets of problems, some reaching far beyond local banks.\n\nToday, I am told that while there may be some similarities with current banking\nconditions and those of a quarter century ago, things are different tins time. You may be\nhearing the same thing from investors and bankers, and, in fact, you may be saying to\nyourself: This time, it’s different.\nOr is it?\n\nThrough the late ‘70s and ‘80s I had the opportunity of being an officer in\n\nbanking supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. I spent those years\nheavily involved in the banking crisis that enveloped the Tenth Federal Reserve District,\na region that includes the central United States: Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Wyoming,\n\nColorado, northern New Mexico and western Missouri.\n\n\fConfidence abounded among borrowers, bankers and even supervisors during the\nearly 1980s. And, as with any euphoric environment, potential pitfalls abound.\nI realize this is not new information to many of you - maybe to none of you. But I\n\nbelieve that this is a particularly apt time to take a retrospective look at banking and\nfinance. We now have a new generation of bankers who haven’t experienced much in the\n\nway of a substantial banking downturn. Furthermore, many who can recall the 1980s will\n\nsoon be leaving the business, and we need to gain from their knowledge and experience\nbefore they leave. Lastly, it never hurts to be reminded of important lessons.\n\nLet me share with you some statements that we actually heard from bankers and bank\n\ndirectors during the ‘80s:\n“I am the CEO of this bank, and we’re doing it my way.”\n“Yes, we loaned a hundred percent on this project, but everyone knows that the\ncollateral value can only go up during construction.”\n“If you understood this better, you wouldn’t have a problem with it.”\n“Although this is unconventional, our accountant says it is perfectly legal.”\n“The corporate plane will save money for the bank in the long run.”\n“We have put our problems behind us - our bank rating will be much improved at\nour next exam.”\n“If it weren’t for the examiners, this bank wouldn’t have failed.”\n\nLessons from the 1980s\nBefore I go further, let me provide a brief background on the 1980s to remind us\n\nof the context of these stories - all of which happened in our Federal Reserve District. In\nthe 1980s, community banks made up much of the District banking population, with a\n\n\fnumber of regional organizations filling out the total - a trend that continues today with\n\nadditional entry by a number of large interstate organizations.\nDistrict banks played various roles in speculative booms in agriculture, energy\nand commercial real estate - all of which were significant for the District economy - and\n\nwhich all came to a precipitous end. The price of crude oil, for example rose from $2.75\na barrel in 1973 to a peak of nearly $37 in 1981 before dropping to $10 in 1986.\nSimilarly, farmland values in Nebraska rose by more than fourfold in the 10-year period\n\nbefore 1982, but then dropped by 45 percent during the next five years. Inflation was\naround 13 percent at the beginning of the 1980s, and the prime rate reached 20.5 percent\n\nin 1981.\n\nThe sharp economic fluctuations had a severe impact on District banks. Dining\nthe 1980s, 309 banks failed in District states, which was 11 percent of the 1980 District\n\nbanking population. Now, let me recognize one very important point before I go on. Most\nbanks in the 1980s, like banks today, were well-run, prudent and successfill. But some\nmanagers couldn’t resist the possibility of greater profit. These examples are designed to\n\nsteer you away from similar mistakes.\n\nFor each of the statements I shared previously, there is a story around the events\nthat eventually unfolded. I have three more statements for which I want to provide the\n\nstory of the consequences. I hope these will serve as examples of what you, as directors,\n\nneed to be alert to when exercising oversight at your banks. Age-old behaviors, such as\ngreed, shortsightedness, and arrogance, are at the center of these problems, and, I would\ncaution, they are with us today just as they were in the 1980s.\n\n\fThe first comment stems from one of the most prominent examples of the ‘80s\nbanking crisis:\n\n“The examiners are dead wrong, they don’t understand what we’re doing -\n\nthey don’t have a clue about our business.”\nAt the height of the agricultural, energy and commercial real estate booms of the\n\nlate 1970s and early 1980s, competition among lenders was intense. When our\nexaminers would ask about a loan with questionable characteristics during tills period,\n\nthey too often heard bankers say, “If I don’t make the loan, the banker down the sheet\nwill.” In many cases, unfortunately, this turned out to be a race to the bottom.\n\nNowhere was this more evident than in the area of energy lending. Good loan\n\nunderwriting standards were often swept away under an aura of optimism and the belief\nthat oil prices could only go up. In this environment, repayment ability was not a\n\nconcern, especially because rising oil prices would bail out any lender, and good loan\ndocumentation was something to be done later, provided the lending business slowed\ndown at some point.\n\nOne notable or, in tills case, notorious District energy lender was Pemi Square\nBank of Oklahoma City. If you’ve read books like “Funny Money” or “Belly Up,” you\nknow a lot of major banks courted Penn Square and competed with one another to\nparticipate in the bank’s seemingly lucrative energy lending business. Energy lending\n\nwas the hottest ticket hi banking then, and in the race to stake out a position, none of\nthese major banks paid any real attention to Penn Square’s loan underwriting and\nadministration or did much in the way of their own due diligence. In many cases, the\n\n\floan participations were bought on blind faith and unlimited optimism. For Penn Square,\n\nthis provided an incentive to make loans to anyone who walked in the door, and Penn\n\nSquare sold more than $2.1 billion in loan participations to 88 banks, including eight of\nthe top 50 banks in the country. Greed, thus, overwhelmed reason for all who were\n\ninvolved. This, in some ways, shikes me as similar to some “hedge funds” excesses of\nthe recent past.\n\nThe outcome of these practices back then was the failure of Penn Square Bank\nduring the Fourth of July weekend in 1982. At the Federal Reserve, we were faced with\n\na decision on whether to continue lending to Penn Square through the discount window\nor to stop and let it fail that weekend. With all the questionable energy loans on Penn\n\nSquare’s books, there was little to be salvaged, and a few colleagues and I found\n\nourselves spending the holiday weekend working on what to do about it. After Penn\nSquare’s failure, FDIC Chairman William Isaac made clear where the blame lay when he\n\nstated, “The Penn Square debacle was caused by a gross dereliction of duty on the part of\nthe bank’s board of directors and management.”\nPerm Square’s failure also led to a ripple effect within the banking industry. A\n\nstaggering total of more than $1.1 billion in Penn Square loans had been sold to the\n\nsupposedly more sophisticated Continental Illinois National Bank. These loans received\nlittle, if any, review by Continental Illinois’ management and served as the initial impetus\ntoward that bank's eventual failure in 1984. Seattle First National Bank was also a heavy\n\nbuyer of Penn Square loans. After Penn Square’s failure, Sea-First quickly slipped from\nbeing a darling of stock market analysts to a bank shut out of funding markets and pushed\n\nto the brink of failure. The orrly thing that prevented it from becoming the largest U.S.\n\n\fbank failure at that tune was its hurried acquisition by Bank of America under a special\nWashington state failing-bank law. Several other major banks also took significant losses\n\non Penn Square loans and fell into a weakened condition.\n\nThe simple fact is there are times when it is wise not to jump on the bandwagon.\nIn some instances, it is better to let the parade pass you by. As directors, you should be\n\nextremely cautious if your management can’t fully and clearly explain the business lines\n\nthey are about to enter or if there is too much of a rush to jump in.\n\n“If you understood this better, you wouldn’t have a problem with it.”\n\nThere are a host of stories from the 1980s and early 1990s of individuals thinking\nthey had a sure thing - something that would produce spectacular returns with little or no\n\nrisk. Unfortunately, bank directors have sometimes been caught up in this enthusiasm as\nwell. One banker, for instance, became a loan originator, relying entirely on another\n\norganization to be the secondary market conduit. It seemed like a foolproof strategy with\nfar better returns than the bank’s ag lending business in the 1980s - simply find willing\nloan customers funneled through from distant sources, make sure the loan paperwork is\nfilled out properly, and then watch the conduit purchase the loans and place them in the\nsecondary market. For several years, this strategy worked - great origination and\n\nservicing fees, virtually no credit risk with the quick sale of loans, and a big boost to local\nemployment. Eventually, however, the market conduit cancelled its contract with the\n\nbank, thus leaving the bank itself to fund and hold all the loans it was making. The\nbank’s balance sheet ballooned with the influx of loans, and the bank soon found that\n\n\fmany of these loans were of questionable quality - a fact that eventually led to the bank’s\nfailure.\n\nAnother bank from this period had a history of struggling along and was glad to\n\nfinally pick up some new ownership, especially because this change brought in two fast­\ntrack partners from a securities firm. Soon the bank’s investment portfolio was earning\nreturns well above market rates - an outcome that pleased the directors and led to\n\nmanagement bonuses.\n\nNo one seemed prepared to question how the bank could continue to earn above­\n\nmarket returns on U.S. government securities. The answer came out later. One of the\npartners in the securities firm was charged with fraud, through a Ponzi scheme, and with\nmoney laundering, and the bank became a defendant in a securities lawsuit. After losing\n\nthe lawsuit, the bank was insolvent.\nSimilar stories can be found in other banks. A particularly common story\n\nconcerns structured notes. How many banks bought such notes through bond salesmen\n\nwith the idea that they earned high returns but were safe because they were backed by the\nFederal Home Loan Bank System and the federal government? One banker even told us\nhe didn’t have to worry about his securities because his broker “controlled” the risk for\n\nhim. In many cases, bankers never gave a second thought to the significant risks\n\nstructured notes presented to their banks.\n\n“Didn’t you learn from corporate finance that leverage can be powerful?”\n\nFranklin Savings was a Kansas thrift institution that made a name for itself\nthrough its complex arbitrage operations, expert staff and ability to “outsmart” major\n\n\fsecurities firms on trades. Franklin Savings started out as a small traditional thrift\n\ninstitution in a small Kansas town. Like many thrifts in the early 1980s, Franklin Savings\n\nfaced substantial losses from interest rate mismatches in its mortgage portfolio. In\nresponse, Franklin changed its business model to an arbitrage and hedging strategy, using\n\nbrokered deposits to fund its positions in mortgage-backed securities, junk bonds and the\nfutures market. The thrift brought in an impressive staff of Wall Street and capital\n\nmarkets hotshots to cany out its strategies, and in just a few years, Franklin grew from\nvirtually nothing to one of the largest and most profitable thrifts in the country with more\nthan $11 billion in assets.\n\nWhile Franklin Savings had impressive returns for a number of years, its rapid growth\n— along with tighter thrift capital standards under FIRREA (Financial Institutions\nReform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989) — turned its leverage into a regulatory\n\nissue. Also, unexpected movements in interest rates led to sizable losses at Franklin in\n\n1989 and to further declines in its capital ratio and net interest margins. In a dispute over\naccounting practices, the Office of Thrift Supervision seized Franklin in 1990. What\n\nfollowed was a series of articles and court cases in which a number of well-known\narbitrage experts took turns defending and criticizing Franklin’s reporting of hedging\n\ngains and losses and the length of time it could take in recognizing some notable losses.\nThere was no consensus on whether Franklin was a viable institution or was truly\n\ninsolvent. In the end, the courts largely deferred to the OTS.\nAmong the lessons we can leant from Franklin Savings is that an institution’s\n\nmanagement should be able to explain fully its strategy and risk exposure to directors,\ncurrent and prospective investors, and bank supervisors. Franklin also could be regarded\n\n\fas forerunner to today’s hedge funds, except that it was relying on insured depositors and\n\nits thrift charter for funding advantages and didn’t have large, sophisticated investors as\nits target clientele. As a result, it had a great responsibility to be transparent in its\nstrategies and to maintain its capital at prudent levels and in compliance with minimum\n\nsupervisory standards.\n\nSome might quibble about whether the thrift examiners were knowledgeable enough\nto judge Franklin’s activities. But they had enough experience by then to be skeptical\nwhen managers at problem institutions would tell them: “We’re too sophisticated to get\n\ninto trouble,” “You don’t understand, we know what we are doing,” and “We have a tax\n\n- or an accounting - angle that will make this pay off.”\n\nConclusion\n\nMy purpose in reviewing these stories with you today is not that I think a return to\na 1980s-style crisis is imminent. Certainly, banking conditions today are good: strong\nearnings, good asset quality, no bank failures in more than two years. However, those\nwho, in the early 1980s, predicted an endless rise in energy markets and real estate values\nwere as confident in their outlook as we are today. And, certainly, the same rules and\n\nlessons continue to apply in banking and finance.\n\nAlthough the world has changed during the last quarter of a century, at least one\nthing has not - human nature. As I mentioned earlier, greed, pride, arrogance and other\n\nhuman frailties are often at the root of bad banking decisions, and those qualities remain\nwith us today. They still motivate behavior as they have hi the past, and, in many cases,\nthese frailties keep us from acting on the lessons we should have learned from previous\n\n\fgenerations. In addition, no matter how sophisticated we think current analytical tools,\n\nmanagement information systems and financial instruments are, the most critical element\nin banking is still individual experience and judgment. In the end, bank employees, and,\n\nI would stress to this audience, bank directors, are still making the important decisions.\n\nThe quality of those decisions will always depend on human characteristics and our\nability to leant from the past.\nOne banking scholar said, “There is really nothing new in banking and finance,\n\neach generation just thinks there is.” So, are we in a different situation than 20 years ago?\n\nI would suggest that one way we can ensure a different outcome is if you, in your\noversight capacity as bank directors, are willing to be skeptical, willing to ask the\n\ndifficult questions and unwilling to accept the answer “This time, if s different.”\n\n\f"

            "content": "MONETARY POLICY .AND THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nNew Mexico Economic Forums\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\nOctober 3, 2006\n\n\f2\n\nIt is a pleasure to be in Albuquerque tonight and to have this opportunity to share\nmy views on the economic outlook and monetary policy. Although our economy has\n\nperformed well over the last few years, some observers are uneasy about the current\n\nsituation. Economic growth is slowing from the brisk pace earlier in the year, and\n\ninflation has been higher than desired as past increases hr energy and other materials\nprices raised production costs and strained consumer budgets.\nMuch of the recent concern has been driven by two issues. One of these is the\nrisk of a larger than anticipated decline in the housing market. Although economists have\n\nbeen predicting a slowing in the housing market for some time, definitive signs of this\n\nslowing only appeared hi the last few months. The extent of this slowing and its impact\non future consumer spending is naturally a concern because the family home is the\nprimary asset for many households.\n\nThe other issue is uncertainty about the direction of energy prices. Over the past\nthree years, sharp increases in petroleum prices have pressured household budgets and\nraised the inflation rate. But, recently, we have seen gasoline prices declining and\n\npetroleum inventories building, creating uncertainty about future energy price\n\nmovements.\nIn tonight’s remarks, I would first like to provide a brief assessment of cunent\n\neconomic conditions and the outlook thr ough 2007. Then I will spend some time\ndiscussing the issues related to the housing and energy markets and how these might\ninfluence the outlook. Finally, I will speak briefly about some of the challenges facing\nmonetary policy in the period ahead. I would emphasize that these views are my own\n\n\f3\nand do not represent the official position of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n\nCurrent Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin by taking a closer look at recent economic performance. Real GDP\ngrew at a brisk pace in the first half of this year. Although growth slowed from the first\nquarter to the second, real output expanded at a 4 percent rate over the first half of 2006,\n\nwell above the economy’s long-run sustainable rate. Part of this surge in economic\n\nactivity was, however, a rebound from economic weakness in the second half of 2005\n\nrelated to the Gulf hurricanes, higher energy costs, and reduced auto sales incentives.\nMost forecasters believe that growth slowed further in the third quarter because of\n\nanother decline in residential investment and more moderate business investment in\nstructures and inventories. Housing starts and sales declined over the last few months,\nthe inventory of unsold homes on the market is rising, and home price appreciation is\ndecelerating. However, consumer spending appears to be growing moderately despite the\npressure on household budgets from past energy price gains.\n\nAlthough the labor market remains healthy, the pace of hiring slowed in the\nspring. Nonfarm payroll employment grew at an average pace of 176,000 jobs per month\nin the first quarter of this year, but only by about 119,000 jobs per month over the next\n\nfive months. While hiring has slowed, the unemployment rate was quite low in August at\n\n4.7 percent of the labor force. This unemployment rate is below the level that many\neconomists believe is consistent with full employment and stable prices.\n\nThe inflation rate has been a major concern so far in 2006. Past sharp increases in\nenergy prices caused broad inflation measures to rise over the last few years. Reflecting\n\n\f4\nhigh resource utilization and some pass-through of higher energy prices, core inflation\nmeasures, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, also worsened earlier this year.\n\nFor example, the core CPI inflation rate rose from about 2.2 percent in 2005 to 2.8\npercent over the year ending in August. This is a pace of inflation that I would not find\n\nacceptable over the longer term. However, it is encouraging that core CPI inflation\nmoderated somewhat in July and August, and core producer price inflation eased as well.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nAlthough policymakers carefully monitor current conditions, our focus is on what\nthe indicators imply for the economic outlook. Monetary policy must be forward-looking\nbecause policy actions affect growth and inflation with long lags. With that hi mind, let\n\nme him to the outlook for real economic growth and inflation.\n\nReflecting past increases in energy prices and interest rates, many forecasters now\nanticipate somewhat below-trend real GDP growth over the second half of this year and\nfor most of 2007. Many economists believe the potential growth rate for the U.S.\n\neconomy is around 3 to 3 % percent.\n\nI share the view that real growth is likely to be slightly below the potential growth\nrate, averaging around 2 to 2 XA percent at an annual rate over the second half of this year\nand around 2 XA to 3 percent in 2007. But I would stress that the economy A likely to\nkeep expanding, and that growth that is a little below trend in the near temi may help to\nkeep the economy from overheating and thus sustain growth over the longer term.\n\nAn important factor in this outlook has been the gradual tightening of monetary\npolicy. Since June 2004, the Federal Reserve has raised its federal fluids rate target from\n\n1 percent to the current level of 5 % percent. Over this period, the stance of monetary\n\n\f5\npolicy has moved from being extremely accommodative to a setting that I would describe\nas somewhat restrictive. Other interest rates have also increased over this period,\nalthough the rise in long-term rates has been fairly moderate.\n\nMuch of the slowing in economic growth will likely come from housing and\n\nconsumer spending. To some degree, higher interest rates have produced this slowing\nbecause housing and consumer durables spending are interest-sensitive sectors. In\n\naddition, past increases in oil prices hint consumer confidence and left many households\nwith less income to spend on discretionary items. Moreover, sharp gams in home prices\n\nhave reduced the affordability of new homes for first-time buyers.\nOffsetting some of the weakness in consumer spending and housing will probably\n\nbe healthy busmess investment and solid export growth. With regard to business\ninvestment, equipment spending was weaker than expected in the second quarter, but\n\nnonresidential construction posted large gains, partly due to increased spending on energy\n\nproduction. Orders for capital equipment continue to trend upward, and operating rates\nare above-average in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, strong growth in corporate\n\nprofits should help to sustain business investment spending.\nIn addition, export growth will likely be a positive for economic growth through\n\n2007. Although the latest monthly trade deficit was disappointing, much of the\n\ndeterioration was due to high oil imports. Going forward, solid growth by our major\ntrading partners should increase the demand for U.S. goods and services. The\nInternational Monetary Fund, for example, just raised its forecast for world economic\n\ngrowth in 2006 and 2007. At the same time, tire expected slower growth in domestic\nhousehold spending should moderate import growth. As a result, I expect international\n\n\f6\n\ntrade to be less of a drag on growth over the next year or so, and possibly even a modest\ncontributor to growth.\n\nWith real GDP growth slowing below the trend rate, labor market pressures are\nlikely to ease somewhat. Although I do not expect large changes in the unemployment\n\nrate, we could see the unemployment rate drift upward by late next year to 5 percent, or\nperhaps slightly higher.\n\nAs to the inflation outlook, most forecasters expect some moderation in the\ninflation rate over the next year or so. Slower economic growth and reduced energy price\n\npressures are expected to gradually reduce both the overall and core inflation rates. I\nshare the view that core consumer price inflation is likely to moderate from the elevated\npace in the first half of this year, and I am pleased that long-term inflation expectations\nwere reasonably well contained during the past run-ups in oil prices.\n\nA Closer Look at Housing and Energy\nAs always, there are many uncertainties about the economic outlook. I want to\nhighlight two issues in particular because these issues are foremost in the minds of many\n\neconomists as well as American households. These are, fust, the risk of a sharper than\nexpected decline in residential investment and, second, uncertainty about the future\n\ndirection of energy prices.\n\nWith respect to housing, some observers have warned for a long time that the\n\nhousing market was becoming overheated. Over the past several years, there has been a\nrapid in crease in the value of U.S. housing fueled by low mortgage rates. This has\n\nincreased household wealth and contributed to strong growth in household consumption\nduring the current economic expansion. If housing prices have risen above levels\n\n\f7\n\ndictated by economic fundamentals, there is a chance that housing prices could fall,\nhurting consumption as well as residential investment.\n\nMy own view is that the housing market is cooling, but this adjustment seems to\nbe happening in an orderly way. Of course, orderly does not necessarily mean painless,\nbut there appears to be enough strength in other sectors to keep real GDP growing.\n\nPolicymakers, however, must remain aware of the risk that the housing market might\n\nsoften more than is built into current economic forecasts.\nEvidence of a cooling housing market is abundant. Single-family housing starts\nfell more than 20 percent over the last year. Existing home sales and new home sales\nhave also declined this year, and the number of unsold homes on the market has risen.\n\nHome price appreciation as measured by the OFHEO index has slowed sharply from over\na 13 percent annual rate last year to less than a 5 percent annual rate in the second\n\nquarter.\n\nThe slowing housing market has both direct and indirect economic effects. Less\nhome construction means fewer jobs for construction workers and fewer building\n\nmaterials purchased, and a lower rate of home sales decreases brokerage commissions.\nBut the reduced appreciation of homes also may have important indirect effects by\nlowering the growth rate of household wealth and the ability of households to easily tap\n\ninto past wealth gains. Many homeowners have used their home equity to finance strong\nconsumption growth through mortgage refinancing or home equity loans.\nThere is a risk of a sharper than predicted slowdown in residential investment and\n\nfalling home prices, which cannot be dismissed entirely. Policymakers will need to\n\n\f8\nmonitor the situation carefully, both in terms of the state of the housing market and its\n\nbroader economic effects.\n\nBut at the national level, we have not seen prolonged declines in nominal home\nprices when the housing market slowed in the past. Moreover, continued income and\n\nemployment growth and high levels of stock market wealth will help to sustain consumer\nspending. As a result, I believe the housing market adjustment is unlikely to derail the\n\neconomic expansion.\n\nLet me turn to a second issue that is very much on people’s minds right now—the\nfuture direction of energy prices. The outlook for energy prices appears to have shifted\nsomewhat.\n\nWe have been through a difficult period in which energy prices soared because of\nstrong world demand and unexpected disruptions to energy supplies. As a result, we\n\nhave become accustomed to nothing but bad news on the energy front, and risk premiums\nwere built into energy prices to reflect possible supply disruptions. But the forces\n\naffecting the energy market appear to have become more balanced.\nOil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile by nature. Small changes in the\n\nquantity of oil supplied may require large price changes to balance the market because\ndemand is relatively insensitive to price changes in the short run. Shocks to the energy\nmarket can come suddenly—as we saw with the hurricanes last year—and there is little\n\nexcess production capacity in the world right now with which to meet unexpected\ndevelopments. Thus, the risk of a sharp upward movement in oil prices has not\n\ndisappeared.\n\n\f9\nBut although markets have focused on rising energy prices for several years, we\n\nnow must seriously consider the possibility of further decreases in energy prices.\nSupplies of petroleum products and natural gas are building, and we have seen some\n\nlarge declines in the prices of gasoline prices, crude oil, and natural gas. For example,\nthe price of a gallon of regular gasoline is more than 20 percent below levels in July.\n\nNatural gas prices have also plummeted because inventories are at record highs for this\ntime of the year. These recent declines in energy prices may help to moderate future\ninflationary pressures and free up some discretionary income for many households and\n\nperhaps also cushion the effects of weaker housing.\nChallenges for Monetary Policy\n\nFinally let me him to the challenges facing monetary policy in the period ahead.\nIn doing so, I am not in a position to speculate about the future course of policy. Instead,\n\nI hope to convey some of my thinking about the factors that will shape the FOMC’s\ndecisions in the period ahead.\nWe must always remember that monetary policy decisions are not based on\n\nindividual data releases. Rather, policy decisions depend on the implications for the\neconomic outlook of the accumulation of data over time. Monetary policy must be\n\nforward-looking because policy influences inflation with long lags. Generally speaking,\na change in the federal funds rate may take an estimated 12 to 18 months to affect\n\ninflation measures.\n\nThe existence of lags hi monetary policy has two important implications. First,\nthe Federal Reserve should only respond to high current inflation to the extent that it is\n\nexpected to be highly persistent. If inflation pressures are seen to be temporary and\n\n\f10\npolicy is currently restrictive, maintaining the cunent policy stance may be consistent\n\nwith a reduction in inflation over time. Second, given the existence of policy lags, the\nactions that the Federal Reserve took over the past year in raising the federal funds rate\nhave not yet had their full effects on the economy or inflation.\n\nAs I have stated previously, I believe a reasonable case can be made that the\ncurrent stance of monetary policy is likely to be consistent with a reduction in irrflatiorr\n\npressures over the next few quarters as energy prices moderate and economic growth\nslows. If housing were to weaken more than in the consensus outlook or if energy prices\n\ndropped further, the case for maintaining the current policy stance might be reinforced.\nBut at the same time, I recognize that further policy tightening could be\nwarranted if the expected slowing in irrflatiorr does trot materialize or if long-term\n\ninflation expectations should rise suddenly. As economic data accumulate over the next\nfew months, I suspect some of the cunent ecottonric uncertainty will dissipate, and we\n\nwill have a clearer view of the monetary policy path going forward.\n\nConcluding Comments\nIn summary, although some observers are uneasy about the current economic\n\nsituation, my reading of the incoming data and economic forecasts is that the economy is\nmaking the transition to a somewhat slower growth path. At the same time, inflationary\n\npressures may moderate if growth does slow to a below-hend pace and upward pressures\non energy prices abate.\nTwo important issues that bear close watching are the risk of a sharper than\n\npredicted slowing in the housing market and uncertainty about the future direction of\n\n\f11\n\nenergy prices. The forces affecting the energy market have become more balanced,\nhowever, with both price increases and decreases being possible.\n\nThe current somewhat restrictive stance of monetary policy may be sufficient to\nreduce core inflation over the next few quarters. But the course of monetary policy is not\nentirely certain and will depend on how the economy evolves in the coming months. In\n\nthis regard, I can assure you that the Federal Reserve will continue to maintain its\ncommitment to price stability and economic growth.\n\n\f"

            "content": "TWELVE BANKS:\nTHE STRENGTH OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nCopper Mountain, Colorado\nSeptember 15, 2006\n\n1\n\n\fFrom time to time, the question is raised: “Does the Federal Reserve still need 12\n\nregional banks?”\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal article earlier this year, a former vice chair of the Federal\nReserve’s Board of Governors suggested the answer to that question is “no,” saying it is\n“very clear” 12 banks are no longer necessaiy and that as few as four might be\n\nsufficient.\n\nWhile some might occasionally suggest a reduction in the number of banks is in\norder, the Federal Reserve believes in its own firhire as a 12-bank system. The Federal\nReserve has invested hr new facilities in Minneapolis, Atlanta and most recently Kansas\nCity, where we will be moving into our- new headquarters building in 2008.\nHowever, with the changes occurring in the banking industry, it is\nunderstandable why some might raise the topic of the number of regional Reserve\n\nBanks and efficiency. The banking and economic structure of the United States\n\nobviously has changed in the decades since the Federal Reserve was created. Today,\nwhile currency remains in wide use, check writing is in decline, and credit and debit\n\ncard use is becoming the standard payment means. These developments most certainly\nhave affected Federal Reserve operations nationwide.\nSo, as a particular business changes, it is perhaps anticipated that some would\n\nask whether a 12-Reserve Bank system is necessary. It is, in this narrow context, a fair\nquestion.\nHowever, it is a question that fails to appreciate the founding purpose and\n\nstructure of the Federal Reserve System. It is a question that, by its very asking, reflects\na different understanding of value versus cost.\n\n2\n\n\fThe Federal Reserve’s 12-bank system was not established as simply a check­\nprocessing system. It was designed to serve multiple interests across a variety of\nregions and financial institutions. It was designed to assure broad input to decisions and\nto provide a mechanism to build national policy consensus across broad regional,\n\neconomic and cultural differences. And it was designed as a public-private partnership,\n\naccountable to, and yet independent of, the government. To miss these connections is\nto incorrectly tie the Federal Reserve’s structure to its processing activities rather than\nto its efforts of assuring trust in the institution.\n\nThe 12-bank system reflects the vast economic differences among regions in the\nUnited States. It also reflects the need to provide a mechanism for input to banking and\nour important credit policy activity for each region.\nOur nation's regional differences are illustrated in a variety of forms. For\n\nexample, some years ago, I spoke with a policy person from another sector of the\n\ncountry making his first visit to the Midwest. During the conversation he quite\nsincerely noted how impressed he was that the city had such a “full” skyline. Clearly he\n\nwas surprised. Similarly, an East Coast reporter traveling to Cleveland once phoned and\nasked us if he could drive by and see the Kansas City Bank during the trip. He\napparently thought Kansas City and Cleveland were closer than the more than 800\n\nmiles that separate us. Being from Missouri, I have come to appreciate in a personal\nsense our regional differences. In my travels through the southern United States, I am\n\noften called a Yankee, while, in the north, I might be referred to as a Southerner. Most\n\nrecently I took notice of a New York Times article pointedly titled “The Not-So United\nStates.”\n\n3\n\n\fFrom an economic perspective, these regional variances can be even more\n\nstriking. One need only look at the differences in average home prices between any\nMidwestern community and a similar community on either coast to get some idea of the\ndiversity of our economy. Regional employment and manufacturing can also vary\n\ngreatly.\n\nThe fact is that as homogenous as we like to drink we are, we remain a country\nwith large variances in regional perceptions, biases and economies.\n\nThe founders of the Federal Reserve were clearly addressing these differences\nwhen they created our decentralized system in 1913. Even then, decades before today’s\n\nhigh-speed technology, there was no compelling physical reason for having 12 Reserve\nBanks.\nIn fact, the nation previously had trot one, but two monolithic central banks, both\n\nlocated itr Philadelphia.\n\nThe first Central Bank of the United States was established in 1791 and was\ndesigned by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. It was controversial from the\n\nstart. Some protested its constitutionality. Many were fearful of its influence.\nWhen it came time for Congress to renew the Bank’s charter in 1811, the Bank’s\n\ncritics were able to stop it. The proposed renewal lost by a margin of a single vote in\neach house of Congress.\n\nThe issue of a central bank reappeared in 1816. For five years, the country had\nbeen without a central bank to regulate banking and credit. Meanwhile, the War of\n1812 had thrown American finance into chaos. Ure Second Bank of the United States\n\n4\n\n\fwas chartered under President James Madison, and once again there was widespread\npublic distrust.\nIn essence, neither the first nor second central bank of the United States was\n\nwidely understood by the population at large. In each case, the central bank was\nstructured as a single bank. It was central and I am sure, using today’s jargon, it was\nefficient—but mostly it was distrusted and even hated by some. Andrew Jackson, a\n\npopulist president, vetoed the renewal of the Second Bank’s charter, bringing an end to\n\ncentral banking in the United States for the next eight decades.\n\nRegional distrust and dissatisfaction crippled the nation’s first two central banks\nand contributed to their eventual demise.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, as the United States became a growing economic\nforce, it was apparent the banking and financial system needed a “central bank.” During\nthis period, the United States faced numerous instances of financial panic as\n\ncommercial banks across the country suffered serious liquidity problems. Business\n\ncredit collapsed, and the public suffered significant financial hardship.\n\nBut there were a few hurdles to overcome in chartering this third central bank.\nAmong the most important was the question of whether the United States once again\n\nwould have a highly centralized institution with concentrated authority. Or would it be\nbest to create a new system—a decentralized system that would share authority across\nthe nation?\nhi his memoirs, Paul Warburg, one of the Federal Reserve’s founders, lists tire\n\nmain objections to the establishment of the central bank:\nFirst: The danger of political control,\n\n5\n\n\fSecond: The danger of control by special interests,\nThird: Hurtful competition with existing banks.\n\nThe debate regarding the structure of the central bank went on for some time, but\nin the end, “a system of centralized reserves and decentralized banking power is clearly\n\nthe system that this country requires,” Warburg said.\n\nThis time the founders better understood that to provide for a more durable\ninstitution they needed a structure that shared the institution’s responsibilities and\n\npower across the country, not just with the central government and in Wall Street. It\n\nwas concluded our central bank should reflect the value we Americans place in shared\ncontrol of some of our more important institutions.\n\nEach Reserve Bank has a board of directors from the region where it is located.\nThese directors not only provide oversight of the Reserve Banks, but also information\nregarding then industries and communities. As was noted to me some time ago,\n“through these 12 Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve has roots that run deep within\nour communities, which enables it to gamer broad public knowledge and support, and\n\nto function far more effectively than if it was located in only a few places.”\n\nThe 12 regional banks flanking the Board of Governors keep the Federal Reserve\nfrom becoming insulated from Main Street America.\nThey interact with the public and financial institutions at a local level. In doing\n\nso, the central bank demonstrates it is something other than a cumbersome bureaucracy\ncounting its money. The board offers the public unprecedented direct access to the\n\nthinking of policymakers. Each bank rs part of the basic fabric of its community,\n\n6\n\n\fproviding a connection between the community and its busmess and policy roles. This\n\nhas been a critical element of the Federal Reserve’s long-run success.\nThis structure and these principles are as important today as they were in 1913,\nperhaps more so. The Federal Reserve System remains a powerfill institution. Its ability\nto gain and hold a broad base of trust and support is fragile, yet crucial to its success\nand, even more importantly, to the success of our national economy.\n\nIn terms of its overall operations and policy, the 12-bank system has consistently\nshown itself to be efficient and adaptable to change.\n\nDining the recent decades, it is hard to name another organization that has been\nsystematically more effective in carrying forward its missions, whether in providing\n\nservices to the public or conducting day-to-day policy.\nJust as important, the 12-bank system has performed superbly across the nation\nduring numerous crisis situations, ranging from the banking crisis of the 1980s, through\n\nthe Y2K millennium experience, the tragedy of 9/11, and most recently dining the\n\naftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nOf course, it may be argued that the issue isn’t so much about a centralized or\ndecentralized structure but about whether the System should have fewer than 12 banks.\nThat debate also occurred at the Federal Reserve’s founding. There was considerable,\nand often heated, discussion regarding the number of Federal Reserve Banks. Some\nwanted as few as five while others wanted more.\n\nEven after the System was established with 12 banks, the debate continued for a\n\ntime. It is interesting to recall that within about two years of the formation of the\n\nFederal Reserve, there was a serious confrontation among the members of the Board of\n\n7\n\n\fGovernors about reducing the number of Districts. In the end, the Attorney General of\nthe United States wrote an opinion stating, in essence, that the Board did not have the\n\nauthority to unilaterally reduce the number of operating Reserve Banks. Senator Carter\nGlass, one of the lawmakers who helped create the Federal Reserve, said those wanting\nto reduce the number of Banks were ignoring the will of the Senate.\n\nA system of reserve banks was seen as an essential element to building trust in so\n\npowerfill an institution, one that would have enormous influence over our economic\nlives.\n\nIt was also Paul Warburg who suggested one strength of the Reserve System lies\nin one of its weaknesses: protection against the dangers of an autocratic central\nadministration, hr this respect, the Reserve System was preferred to a more centralized\nsystem. There is no doubt that such a system, if enacted, might have been more\n\nefficient, but it certainly would have offered easier and more tempting targets for\n\npolitical attacks. This political superiority of the Reserve System was of immense\nimportance, although it is, at the same time, a weakness.\n\nObviously, many tilings have changed during the past eight decades. We have\nexperienced exceptional changes in technology, banking structure, banking products\nand a greater national and international scope of busmess and banking. But, the\n\nfundamentals that drove the United States toward a 12-bank system are as real today as\nthey were then.\n\nToday, concent for centralized and concentrated financial power understandably\nremains important in the minds of the American public. The trends in consolidation\nhave only heightened concerns in this regard.\n\n8\n\n\fAt the same time, although there has been significant consolidation within the\n\nfinancial system, there remain thousands of regional and community banks which\ncontinue to play an important role across the nation. Banking activities vary across the\nnation and are greatly affected by their regional economies.\n\nFor example, about 25 percent of New England’s banks failed in the early 1990s\nafter local real estate values collapsed. In our own Tenth District, anyone involved hr\n\nbusiness or banking can recall vividly what happened in this region after the collapse of\n\nvalues hi agriculture, energy and real estate. While it would be nonsense to suggest that\nthese crises could not have been addressed in a centralized banking system, it is fair to\n\nsay they were well addressed in a decentralized, although coordinated, manner.\nKnowledgeable working relationships with regional and community banks are\n\ncritical to understanding change and perhaps even discovering these types of problems\nin a timely fashion. The 12 Reserve Banks give us a broad distribution of contacts and\n\nmeans of interaction with commercial banking that is crucial for understanding and\nresponding to local banking markets. Such interaction might be accomplished with\n\nfewer than 12 Reserve Banks but, I would argue, not as effectively.\nOn the justification for having fewer rather than more Reserve Banks as it relates\nto cost, I would note a couple of points.\n\nThe System has been diligent in controlling its costs. Inflation-adjusted expenses\nfor the 12 banks, as reported in the System’s budget documents, have increased on\naverage about 1.5 percent a year since 1970, showing actual declines in real terms in\n\nrecent years.\n\n9\n\n\fMoreover, the Federal Reserve has consolidated some of its operations where the\n\nopportunity to improve efficiency was apparent. Check processing is one such area.\nOthers include wire transfers, retail electronic payments and support activities. All\nthese actions have served to contain costs.\n\nYes, there is every reason to pursue cost savings when it makes sense to do so.\nCertainly repetitive processes often benefit from new technology that simplifies\noperations.\n\nBut there is another side to consolidation where costs can rise and performance\n\ncan decline. When the consolidation withdraws authority for local decision-making, it\ncan lead to cumbersome bureaucracies, slower decision-making and loss of local\n\nincentive and performance.\nAll consolidations involve cost-benefit trade-offs. Balancing the difficult-tomeasure benefits of access, communication, broad regional representation and\n\noperational delivery against any hard-dollar savings that might come from having fewer\nbanks requires an understanding of bottom-line accounting and organizational purpose.\nIn this context, the value over the cost of our 12-bank system is considerable.\n\nFinally, the value of this structure has been recognized by others. In 1998, the\n\n16-bank European Central Bank was established and modeled closely to the Federal\nReserve. Like our nation’s central bank, the ECB is responsible to a diverse population\n\nacross a broad region with varying economic and banking conditions. As with the\n\nFederal Reserve, a broad base of support is necessary for the ECB to succeed in its\n\nmission.\n\n10\n\n\fRobert Bremner, in his biography of Chairman William McChesney Martin,\n\nreferred to a quote which described the Federal Reserve System as “America’s greatest\ncontribution to the science of government.”\n\nWhile this may be hyperbole, looking in the past, this stincture has served us\nwell. And looking to the future, it is designed to last.\n\n11\n\n\f"

            "content": "THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND MONETARY POLICY:\nCHALLENGES IN THE PERIOD AHEAD\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOmaha, Nebraska\nJuly 19, 2006\n\n\f2\n\nIt is a pleasure to be in Omaha today to discuss the national economic outlook and\n\nmonetary policy. Over the past three years, the U.S. economy performed very well.\n\nStrong output and employment growth led to a significant drop in the unemployment rate,\nand inflation remained relatively low despite higher energy costs.\nRecently, however, we have seen increasing signs that economic conditions are\nbecoming less favorable. Continuing high energy costs and rising interest rates appear to\n\nbe slowing economic growth. At the same time, inflationary pressures are beginning to\n\nemerge. These developments have been associated with increased volatility in\ncommodity markets and in financial markets around the world.\n\nThe changing economic environment has important implications for the Federal\nReserve’s monetary policy. Since June 2004, the Federal Reserve has systematically\n\nraised its federal funds rate target from 1 % to its current level of 5 % %. Over this\n\nperiod, as credit costs have increased, the stance of monetary policy has moved from\nbeing extremely accommodative to a setting I would characterize as somewhat restrictive.\n\nGoing forward, however, the outlook for policy is much less clear, and\nuncertainty about tire future policy path appears to be one factor behind some of the\n\nrecent volatility in financial markets. Indeed, as you are aware, there is currently a lively\n\ndebate among financial market participants about whether the Fed will need to raise rates\nfurther to ward off inflationary pressures or whether the Fed has already tightened\n\nsufficiently to maintain its commitment to long-run price stability and stable economic\n\ngrowth.\n\n\f3\nIn my remarks, today, I would like to provide my assessment of current economic\n\nconditions and the outlook for the economy in the period ahead. I would also like to offer\nmy perspective on the challenges facing monetary policy in this difficult economic\nenvironment. In this regard, I would emphasize that my views are my own and do not\n\nrepresent the official position of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market\n\nCommittee.\n\nCurrent Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin by taking a closer look at the performance of the economy in recent\nmonths. 2006 started out on a very strong note. First quarter GDP growth rose 5.6 %, a\n\nconsiderable improvement from the sluggish pace at the end of 2005. As you may recall,\ngrowth was held down in the second half of last year by a combination of the effects of\nthe Gulf hurricanes, higher energy costs, and reduced auto incentives. So, part of the\nsurge in growth in the first quarter was a bounce back from the economic weakness last\n\nyear.\nMost forecasters believe that the pace of economic activity slowed in the second\n\nquarter of this year to around 3 % due to weaker consumer spending and slower\n\nresidential investment. The most recent round of energy price increases seems to be\nhitting some consumers veiy hard, and the effects are being felt both in purchases of\n\nautos and other retail sales. There is also growing evidence that housing is slowing in\nmost parts of the country as higher interest rates and rising home prices have reduced\n\naffordability. At the national level, single family pennits have declined for several\n\n\f4\nmonths. Signs of a softening housing market are also showing through in weaker\n\nhousing starts and sales of new and existing homes in many parts of the country.\n\nWe are also seeing signs that hiring is slowing. Nonfarm payroll employment\naveraged 176,000 over the first three months of the year but only 108,000 hi the second\n\nquarter. Much of this slowdown has been hi retail trade and construction, no doubt\nreflecting the softness hi consumer spendhig and housing.\n\nAmid the signs of slower growth, recent inflation news has been somewhat\ndisturbing. While higher energy costs have caused broad inflation measures to rise over\n\nthe past few years, most core measures of inflation, which exclude volatile energy and\n\nfood prices, have remained low. In the past few months, however, we have seen sizeable\n\nincreases even hi core measures of inflation. For example, core CPI rose 3.8 % over the\nthree months from March to May while the core PCE deflator increased 3.25 % over a\nsimilar period.\n\nOne explanation for the pickup hi inflation is that energy costs are now being\n\npassed tlu'ough to prices of other goods and services to a greater extent than previously.\n\nWhen energy costs increased a few years ago, the lack of pass through to the general\nprice level was somewhat surprising. Now the surprise seems to be going in the opposite\n\ndirection.\nAlternatively, these increases could also reflect fact that the economy has been\n\noperating at high levels of resource utilization for a period of time. The current\n\nunemployment rate of 4.6 % is below the level many economists believe is consistent\nwith full employment and stable prices. And, capacity utilization has been rising in many\nindustries. In any event, if these recent elevated inflation readings persist, they could\n\n\f5\nmake it difficult for the Federal Reserve to maintain price stability over a medium-term\n\ntime horizon.\n\nThe Outlook and Rrsks to the Outlook\nSo far, I have discussed where the economy has been and our best estimates of the\n\ncurrent economic situation. From a monetary policy standpoint, however, it is the\n\neconomic outlook over the next several quarters that is most important in determining the\nfuture path of policy. Let me move next to a brief discussion of the outlook and some of\nmajor risks to the outlook in the period ahead.\n\nMany economic forecasters see somewhat slower growth continuing in the second\nhalf of this year and into 2007. Indeed, most estimates of GDP gr owth over the next six\n\nquarters are about 3 % or slightly lower, which seems quite reasonable to me. In looking\nat these numbers it is important to keep them in perspective. Many economists believe\nthat the U.S. economy’s potential growth rate is around 3.25 %, so a 3 % growth rate,\n\nwhile somewhat below potential, may be a desirable development to keep the economy\n\nfrom overheating.\n\nA more detailed look at the outlook suggests that the major areas of slowing in\nmost forecasts are housing and consumer spending, reflecting the continuing effects of\nhigh interest rates, high energy costs, and slower employment growth. In addition, weak\n\nhousing prices and stock prices could act as a drag on consumer spending.\nOffsetting the weakness in these sectors are healthy business investment\n\nspending on plant and equipment and increased exports due to strong growth in our major\ntrading partners. Also, when we look beyond the consumer and housing sectors, there\n\n\f6\n\nappears to be considerable strength in manufacturing, much of it aimed toward export\nmarkets, that is likely to provide ongoing support to the economy.\nAs to the outlook for inflation, most forecasters see elevated inflation levels for\nthe next few months. Over the longer term, however, slowing economic growth and a\n\nmoderation in energy costs are expected to put downward pressure on both overall and\n\ncore inflation measures. Indeed, most forecasters see both overall and core measures of\ninflation somewhat lower next year.\n\nWhile I am in general agreement with the consensus outlook that I have\ndescribed, I recognize there are both upside risks to inflation and downside risks to\n\ngrowth. If either should materialize, the future course of monetary policy could be quite\ndifferent than we now expect.\n\nAs to inflation risks, the main concern is that inflation could stay elevated for a\nconsiderable period offline and could feed into higher inflation expectations in financial\n\nmarkets and labor markets. If so, the Federal Reserve might have to tighten policy\n\nfurther to insure that inflation expectations are contained and price stability is maintained\nover the long term. Thus far, inflation expectations have remained fairly subdued, but\n\nthey will require continued scrutiny in coming months.\nHowever, there is also some likelihood that the economy could slow more than\n\nwe currently expect. The last several policy moves by the Federal Reserve are still\nworking through the economy and may have a bigger effect in restraining growth than we\nare forecasting. Growth could also be weaker if energy prices do not moderate as\n\nexpected. In addition, consumers in the U.S. have been living beyond their means in\n\nrecent years, tapping into savings and home equity to finance current consumption. Any\n\n\f7\n\nretrenchment by consumers from recent spending patterns could lead to weaker economic\ngrowth. Finally, central banks in a number of other industrialized countries are currently\ntightening policy, and slower growth abroad could limit some of the anticipated\n\nimprovement in U.S. exports over the next year.\n\nChallenges for Monetary Policy\n\nWith this discussion of the economic outlook as a backdrop, I would like to use\nmy remaining time today to explore the challenges facing monetary policy in the period\nahead. In doing so, I am not in a position to speculate about the future course of policy.\n\nRather, what I hope to convey is some of my thinking about the design of monetary\npolicy strategy in the current economic environment.\n\nAt the present time, financial markets place a fairly high probability on another\nincrease in the federal funds rate target from 5 V* % to 5 Vi % at the August FOMC\n\nmeeting. Tire downward slope to the Treasury yield curve, however, suggests that\nmarkets believe the Federal Reserve is close to completing the tightening cycle and is\n\nlikely to reduce rates somewhat over a longer time horizon.\n\nThe primary reason markets expect further tightening in the near term is the\nexpected response of the Federal Reserve to higher core inflation. Indeed, this morning’s\n\nrelease of the June CPI numbers is consistent with the view that inflation pressures are\ncontinuing. The overall CPI for June was up .2 % and core CPI was up .3 %. The June\n\nnumbers imply a three-month rate of 5.1 % for overall CPI and 3.6 % for core CPI and\ntwelve-month rates of 4.3 % and 2.6 % respectively.\n\n\f8\nIn interpreting these inflation measures, it is help fill to keep a couple of points in\n\nmind. First, monetary policy decisions are not driven by individual data releases. Rather,\n\nthey depend on the implications for the economic outlook of the accumulation of data\nover time. Second, monetary policy influences inflation only with fairly long lags.\n\nGenerally speaking, a change in the federal funds rate today may take an estimated 12 to\n18 months to affect inflation measures. As a consequence, monetary policy must be\n\nforward-looking in design.\n\nThe existence of lags hi monetary policy has two important implications. First,\nthe Federal Reserve should only respond to high cunent inflation to the extent that\ninflation is expected to be very persistent. Indeed, to the extent inflation pressures are\n\nseen as temporary and policy is currently restrictive, maintaining the current policy\nstance may be consistent with a reduction in inflation over time. Of course, the other\n\naspect of this is that if inflation pressures remain elevated, then they will affect\n\ninflationary expectations requiring more forceful action later.\n\nSecond, given the existence of policy lags, the actions that the Federal Reserve\ntook over the past year in moving the federal funds rate target from 3 % % hi June 2005\n\nto 5 'A % last month have not yet had their full effects on the economy or inflation. This\nis one reason why most forecasters predict lower growth and inflation in the future even\n\nwhile current growth and inflation are quite strong.\n\nBased on this discussion, I believe a reasonable case can be made that the cunent\nstance of monetary policy is likely to be consistent with a reduction in inflation pressures\n\nover the next few quarters as energy costs moderate and economic growth slows. At the\n\nsame time, I recognize that further policy tightening could be wananted should the\n\n\f9\nexpected slowing in inflation not materialize. As economic data accumulate over the\n\nnext few months, hopefully some of the current economic uncertainty will dissipate, and\nwe will have a clearer view of the path of monetary policy going forward.\n\nConcluding Comments\n\nTo conclude my remarks, today, I would like to briefly summarize my views on\nthe economic outlook and monetary policy. My reading of the incoming data and\n\neconomic forecasts is that the U.S. economy is beginning a gradual transition to a\nsomewhat slower path of economic growth. At the same time, inflation pressures have\n\nrisen to the point that they cannot be easily dismissed. In this environment, the future\n\ncourse of monetary policy is uncertain and will depend, to a large extent on how the\neconomy evolves in coming months. In this regard, I can assure you that the Federal\nReserve will continue to maintain its commitment to price stability and economic growth.\n\n\f"

            "content": "QUALITY OF THE LABOR FORCE\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nThe Governor's 2006 Summit on Workforce Development\nCasper, Wyoming\nMay 16, 2006\n\n\f2\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be with you this evening to discuss issues surrounding the\nnation's labor force. Recently, our economy has grown at a robust pace, and, as a result,\nlabor and capital resources are now at or near the point of frill utilization. While inflation\n\nhas risen because of increased energy prices, outside the energy sector, inflation has\nremained well contained. Over the same period, monetary policy has moved from a\n\nhighly accommodative stance to one that today is more neutral. Remarkably, this\neconomic performance has occurred despite a number of shocks to the economy,\n\nincluding hurricanes and considerable energy price volatility. The U.S. economy\ncontinues to demonstrate its resiliency and underlying macroeconomic strength.\n\nAs I talk with business people in the Tenth District, I am hearing more reports of\nshortages of qualified workers. This is one indication that resource utilization is\nincreasing. In a recent survey of small businesses by the National Federation of\n\nIndependent Busmesses, 31 percent of Finns reported unfilled job openings, almost twice\nas many as reported such openings in 2003. hi addition, 13 percent of firms listed labor\n\nquality as their single most important problem—the third-most common response behind\ntaxes and health insurance.\n\nMismatches between the supply of skills in the workforce and the demand for\n\nskills by employers create challenges for monetary policy, making it harder to achieve\nlow overall unemployment with stable inflation. But shortages in skilled workers also\nraise longer-run issues for our economic performance. Inadequate growth in the supply\n\nof skilled workers can hold down our overall rate of economic growth. In addition,\nfailure of the supply of skilled workers to keep up with the demand can worsen income\n\ninequality by widening the gap between skilled and unskilled wages.\n\n\f3\nShortages of qualified workers have become more common partly because\n\nstronger job growth has reduced the overall rate of unemployment. But several other\nfactors may be contributing to the increased reports of shortages. First, firms in some\n\nindustries may be having more difficulty finding workers because the industries are being\nshunned by young people just entering the labor force. Before the 1980s, for example,\n\nmanufacturing was seen as a source of stable, high-paying jobs with generous benefits.\n\nWith frequent stories in the media about plant closures and cuts in wages and benefits,\ncareers in manufacturing have lost some of their appeal to today’s youth. In a similar\n\nmanner, the boom-and-bust cycle in the energy sector over the last three decades\n\ndiscouraged many young people from pursuing careers as oil and gas engineers or rig\nworkers.\n\nAnother factor that may be contributing to the increased reports of shortages is\nthat films are hying to fill new positions from outside instead of training their existing\n\nworkers. According to this view, increased turnover in the labor market has reduced\nfirms’ incentive to invest in job training. Rather than bringing existing workers up to\n\nspeed, firms may be seeking workers who already have the required skills and can hit the\nground running. If the required skills are highly specific, such workers may be hard to\n\nfind.\nA final explanation for the reported shortages is that globalization and\n\ntechno logical change are creating demands for new skills. In U.S. manufachiring,\ncompetition from foreign companies with access to low-wage, unskilled labor is causing\n\na shift toward higher-end products that are technologically sophisticated or tailored to the\n\nspecific needs of customers. These higher-end products have increased the demand for\n\n\f4\n\nhighly skilled factory workers at the same time that the supply of young people interested\nin manufacturing careers has declined.\n\nReported shortages of skilled workers are less common today than during the\neconomic boom of the late 1990s. However, there are reasons to believe such shortages\n\nmay increase in the years ahead, even if the economy grows close to its potential. One\nreason is that in some industries, a high percentage of skilled employees are in their 50s\n\nand close to retirement. Two such industries that are important in our District are\naircraft manufacturing and oil and gas extraction. In 2000, the share of employees aged\n50 or older was 37 percent in aircraft manufacturing and 31 percent in oil and gas\n\nextraction, compared to 25 percent in all industries.\nAnother reason shortages of skilled workers may increase is that growth in\n\neducational attainment is projected to slow. The percentage of people aged 25 and older\nwith college degrees has increased sharply since World War II—from only 6 percent\n\nright after the war to 28 percent in 2004. During the last three decades however, most of\nthe increase in the share of college graduates has been due to the replacement of elderly\n\npeople who grew up during times of low college enrollment by better educated young\n\npeople. Over the same period, the share of adults aged 25 to 29 who graduated from\n\ncollege has increased only modestly. If college enrollment rates do not him back upward,\ngrowth in the supply of college graduates will likely fall short of growth in the demand\n\nfor such workers, which will continue to be boosted by technological change.\n\nWhat can be done to alleviate such shortages of skilled workers? First is to raise\ncollege enrollment in the nation. Dining the last several years, there have been some\nsigns of an increase in school attendance among people in their late teens. It is too soon\n\n\f5\nto know, however, whether this increased interest in school is a temporary response to the\nslowing of the economy in the early 2000s or a longer-term trend. At some point, further\n\nincreases in college enrollment will come only by raising enrollment among the nation’s\ndisadvantaged minorities, who currently lag well behind in college attendance. For some\n\nstates such as Wyoming, an additional challenge is to retain those young people who do\n\ngo on to college. During the second half of the 1990s, for example. Wyoming suffered a\nnet outflow of 3,800 college graduates aged 25 and older, more than 5 percent of the\n\ntotal.\nBesides increasing the supply of college graduates in the U.S., it is important to\nupgrade the skills of blue collar and clerical workers in the middle of the job distribution.\n\nOne way to do that is to devote more resources to primary and secondary education,\nincluding vocational programs. Another way is to take greater advantage of community\n\ncolleges, which not only prepare local youth for technical careers but also retrain older\n\nadults whose skills have become outdated. Improving skills for middle-level workers is\nnot only valuable in its own right but also can help states like Wyoming attract and retain\n\nhighly educated workers. If Wyoming’s blue collar and clerical workers are viewed as\nhighly productive, more firms will choose to locate here. And if more firms locate here,\nmore high-level jobs will be created for college graduates, slowing the brain drain.\n\nWhile increasing the quantity of education in the United States is highly desirable,\nchanges in the global economy make it equally important to increase the quality of\n\neducation. The supply of highly educated workers in foreign countries has increased\ngreatly over the last three decades. With advances hi electronic conununication, some\n\nservices that used to be produced by well-educated workers in the United States now can\n\n\f6\nbe provided by these highly educated workers abroad. In the face of these changes, we\n\nneed to ensure that U.S. workers at all levels have the kinds of skills that allow them to\ndo their jobs better than lower-paid workers overseas. That means putting more emphasis\nin our educational system on creativity, problem solving, and communication skills.\n\nMy main focus this evening has been on the need for skilled workers. But even\nwith continued technological progress, there will still be many unskilled jobs that need to\nbe performed in our economy. For the most part, these will be jobs that require little\neducation but cannot be easily automated, such as janitorial jobs, restaurant jobs, and\n\ncertain construction and agricultural jobs. In recent years, unskilled inunigrants have\nplayed an important role in performing these jobs, and they can continue to do so in the\n\nfuture. However, because the potential supply of unskilled workers from poorer\n\ncountries is so vast, it is important to bring the volume of immigration under better\ncontrol, as Congress and the Administration are trying to do. Whatever level of\nimmigration we do decide to allow in this country, we also must rrrake sure to provide\n\nopportunities for poorly educated immigrants to upgrade their skills. That way unskilled\nimmigrants can eventually move on to better jobs, leaving the many low-end jobs that\nstill need to be performed in our economy to the next round of legal immigrants.\n\nLet me conclude by saying that to ensure favorable economic performance in the\nU.S. economy over the longer run, it is important to increase the skills of our workforce.\nThis will require us not only to raise college enrollment hr the nation but also use our\ncommunity colleges and other educational institutions to upgrade skills in the middle of\n\nthe job distribution.\n\n\f"

The U.S. economy\ncontinues to demonstrate its resiliency and underlying macroeconomic strength.\n\nThis evening, I plan to review recent economic performance, provide my\nassessment of the near-term economic outlook and discuss the implications of the outlook\n\nfor monetary policy. In particular, I will start by looking back at the performance of the\n\nU.S. economy in 2005 and then take a look at some of the fundamental forces that will be\nshaping the outlook in 2006. Next, I’ll discuss some of the risks to the outlook—both on\n\nthe upside and the downside. I’ll conclude with a brief discussion of how monetary\npolicy has contributed to the favorable performance of the economy over the last year or\n\nso and discuss factors that will influence the course of monetary policy over the next\nseveral months.\n\nLooking back at 2005\n\nLet me begin by taking a look back at the year just ended. Real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growth was weaker than expected in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\n\f3\n\ngrowing at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent. It is important to note, though, that the\nslower growth was probably due to transitory factors. Auto sales weakened early in the\n\nfourth quarter because of reduced sales incentives. Defense spending fell sharply, which\nis unlikely to continue in the months ahead. And, because of the hurricanes, net exports\n\nworsened. In particular, exports were temporarily depressed by the shutdown of some\n\nGulf ports, and imports of crude oil and chemicals surged temporarily to replace lost\nproduction.\nDespite the weaker-than-expected numbers for the fourth quarter, the economy\n\ngrew at a solid pace of 3.2 percent in 2005 as a whole. Moreover, growth was strong\nenough to further reduce the unemployment rate and raise industrial capacity use. For\nexample, the unemployment rate fell from 5.4 percent in December 2004 to 4.9 percent in\n\nDecember 2005, and it has continued to fall tins year to 4.8 percent in February, hi\n\naddition, capacity utilization in manufacturing has edged up to around its long-run\naverage rate.\nAll major components of domestic demand contributed to this performance.\n\nConsumer and business spending grew solidly, and residential investment spending\n\nactually accelerated a bit relative to the previous year. The only major sector not\ncontributing significantly to overall growth was the foreign trade sector, where we\n\ncontinued to see large and growing deficits.\n\nOn the inflation front, the news was also reasonably good. Although there was a\nsignificant impact of higher energy prices on overall inflation, the core inflation rate\n\nremained low and stable. Over the year ended in December, the overall consumer price\nindex (CPI) rose by 3.4 percent. But the CPI excluding food and energy prices rose a\n\n\f4\nmore modest 2.2 percent. Looking at the more recent data for the 12-mouth period\n\nthrough February 2006, overall CPI rose 3.6 percent, but core CPI inflation actually\ndeclined a bit to 2.1 percent. Thus, while we have seen sharp increases in energy prices\n\ncontribute to higher headline inflation, we have not seen these price pressures passed\nthrough to a higher core inflation rate.\nOne of the factors that contributed to the solid economic performance last year\n\nwas the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Although the Federal Open Market\n\nCommittee (FOMC) raised the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each\n\nof its eight meetings last year, and at both meetings so far this year, for most of 2005, the\nrate remained below the level most analysts would describe as neutral. A neutral funds\nrate is one that neither stimulates nor restrains overall economic activity. Although no\none knows exactly what level of the hinds rate is consistent with neutrality, we clearly\ndid not approach the neutral range until late in 2005. Recall that at the beginning of the\n\nyear, the funds rate was just 2 V» percent in nominal terms—and zero percent after\nadjusting for inflation. Today, it is 4 3/4 percent nominal and around 2 16 percent real. So,\n\nthroughout most—if not all—of 2005, monetary policy remained accommodative.\n\nLooking ahead at 2006\nLooking ahead. I expect the favorable performance of the economy to continue.\nMost private forecasters expect the momentum from the solid growth in 2005 to continue\n\ninto 2006. While 2005 ended on a weak note, that weakness was due to special factors\nthat will not likely be repeated in 2006. In addition, the limited data we have so far for\n\nthe first quarter of 2006 suggest a rebound is likely in the first quarter. Consumer\nspending was strong in January, and construction activity actually picked up speed due to\n\n\f5\nthe unusually warm weather, backing down only recently. Labor market indicators\n\nsuggest continued growth in employment and a low level of unemployment.\nAlthough monetary policy is less accommodative, it will continue to support\n\neconomic activity in the near term. Because of the lags with will ch monetary policy\naffects the economy, monetary policy accommodation over the past year will continue to\n\nact as an economic stimulant in the near term, though clearly not as much of one as in the\npast several years. Over the second half of this year, our moves to remove monetary\n\naccommodation should help ensure the economy settles into a growth rate that is\nconsistent with the economy’s long-run growth potential.\n\nMy view is similar to the consensus of private sector forecasters. I would expect\ngrowth of around 3 Yi percent (Q4/Q4) for 2006, which is just slightly above most\nestimates of trend GDP growth. That said, growth in the first quarter may come in well\n\nabove 3 V2 percent, as the economy rebounds from the sluggish fourth quarter. But over\nthe course of the year. I would expect to see GDP decelerate to around its trend growth\nrate.\n\nAs hi 2005, consumer spending is expected to be a primary contributor to growth\nin 2006. In recent months, consumer confidence has rebounded sharply from its\nhurricane-related plunge last fall. More importantly, consumer expectations of the future\n\nare positive. Concerns about high heating costs this winter have been mitigated to some\n\nextent by unseasonable warm weather, which has kept fuel supplies ample and costs more\nor less in check. And these concerns should diminish further this spring as heating\n\ndemands decline and production in the Gulf region is more hilly restored.\n\n\f6\n\nDespite the upheavals in several sectors of the economy, such as the domestic\nauto industry, busmess investment is also expected to contribute to growth in 2006.\n\nStrong growth of corporate earnings combined with low borrowing costs over the past\ntwo years has led to marked improvement in firms’ balance sheets, hi the fourth quarter\n\nof last year, corporate profits were 21 percent higher than the year-earlier period.\nLooking ahead, while there may be some slowing from recent performance, most private\nsector forecasters expect profit growth of 8 percent to 9 percent in 2006. Together,\nunproved balance sheets and strong profit growth will provide fundamental support for\n\ninvestment spending.\nhi the international sector, continued strong growth in the rest of the world will\nreduce the drag on U.S. GDP growth corning from net exports. Such growth, however, is\n\nalso likely to increase further global demand for natural resources. This implies that\nprices for some commodities, such as oil and cement, may remain at elevated levels for\nan extended period.\n\nThe solid gr owth forecast for the economy also should translate into steady\ngrowth in employment. The increases will be somewhat less than employment gains seen\nin the past two years due to two factors. First, as growth slows and converges toward the\n\neconomy’s trend growth rate, fewer additional workers will be needed. And second,\nstrong productivity growth over the past few years is expected to continue, suggesting\nthat the existing workforce will be able to produce a sizeable portion of the projected\n\nincrease in output. Based on these factors, I would expect that employment will grow by\n\n\f7\nbetween 1.5 million and 2 million jobs in 2006. That translates into an increase of\n125,000 to 167,000 jobs per month.\n\nTurning to inflation, I expect the core inflation rate to remain at about its current\n\nlevel. Tints far, the impact of higher energy prices on the core measure of CPI inflation\nhas been moderate. However, I recognize that the longer energy prices remain at\nelevated levels, the greater the possibility that these higher costs will be passed on from\n\nproducers to consumers. Still, for 2006,1 generally expect these energy price pressures\n\nto result in a modest increase of core inflation in the first half of the year before\ndiminishing in the second half.\n\nRisks to the outlook\n\nLet me turn now to some of the risks to this very favorable outlook. Despite the\nremarkable resilience of the U.S. economy to a variety of economic shocks over the past\nseveral years, if s important that we continue to remain aware of potential problems.\n\nRight now, in my view, the risks to the favorable outlook for inflation and growth are\nreasonably well-balanced. While there might be a small upside risk to the inflation\n\noutlook, that risk is balanced by a small downside risk to economic growth.\n\nThe upside risk for inflation stems from two sources. First, the increase in energy\nprices has led to increased costs for transporting and producing many goods and services.\n\nIf these higher costs of production are passed through to consumer prices, we could see a\ngreater-than-expected increase in core inflation. Second, if the economy expands at a\n\nrate faster than underlying trend growth, the pool of available workers will shrink. Such\nexpansion could eventually result in higher labor costs. Thus far, we have yet to see\nrapid growth in wages. Over the past year, unit labor costs have increased by about onlyl\n\n\f8\npercent, but they accelerated by 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter. Looking forward,\n\nmeasures of wage pressures and total resource demands will require carefill monitoring as\nthe economy continues to grow.\n\nThe risk of slower-than-expected output growth also stems from several sources.\nOver the past several years, as you know, there's been a rapid increase in the value of\n\nhousing in the United States fueled by low mortgage interest rates. This has increased\nhousehold wealth and contributed to strong growth in household consumption during the\ncurrent economic expansion. But, if housing prices have risen above levels dictated by\n\neconomic fundamentals, there’s a chance prices could fall. With the current high debt\n\nlevel of consumers, such a drop in household wealth could cause them to sharply curtail\n\ntheir spending, leading to slower growth in the economy. While I don’t think there is\nmuch risk of a housing price collapse on a nationwide basis, we could see a decline in\nprices in certain markets.\n\nAnother risk to output growth is the current low savings rate in the United States.\n\nFor the last three quarters of 2005, the personal savings rate was negative. That means\nthat personal consumption spending exceeded disposable income. So while businesses\n\nhave been improving their balance sheets as a result of strong earnings growth, consumer\n\ndebt has been increasing. The picture for government savings is not any better due to the\ncurrent large federal budget deficit. Combined, strong consumer and government\n\ndemand have caused imports to exceed exports, resulting over time in the large U.S. trade\ndeficit, now approaching 7 percent of nominal GDP. To finance this tr ade deficit,\n\nforeigners have acquired large holdings of U.S. securities.\n\n\f9\nAt some point, the domestic savings rate will need to increase to reduce this trade\n\nimbalance. Many economists expect that the transition to a higher savings rate will occur\nsmoothly, but with an imbalance of this magnitude, there is a chance that a rapid\n\ntransition could lead to a downturn in the economy through a sharp falloff in\n\nconsumption.\n\nTo summarize, the risks to the favorable outlook—while present, as always—\ncurrently appear to be balanced. A small risk of higher inflation is roughly balanced by a\n\nsmall risk of slower output growth. With the economy now at or near the point of frill\nutilization of resources, it will become more challenging to set a course for monetary\n\npolicy that continues to properly balance these risks.\n\nImplications for monetary policy\n\nThat brings me to the final part of my presentation: the role of monetary policy in\nfostering sustainable economic growth with price stability. Over the course of the last\n\nyear and a half, the FOMC gradually has raised its target for the federal funds rate from\nan unusually low level of 1 percent in 2004 to 4 3A percent today. As a result of these\n\nactions, the funds rate now has retinned to a more normal level and is within the range\n\nmost analysts would associate with neutrality. In fact, the funds rate now may be at the\n\nupper end of the range I would associate with neutrality. While this strikes me as where\nwe most likely should be, balancing inflation and output risks, we cannot know this for\ncertain. Only as new data and anecdotal information on the economy arrive will we\nknow how monetary policy will need to respond.\n\nWhen the funds rate was at the unusually low level of 1 percent two years ago, it\n\nwas relatively easy to signal a direction for future changes in monetary policy. As the\n\n\f10\neconomy gained momentum in 2004, it was clear that the fimds rate needed to increase\ngradually back to a more normal or neutral range. However, as the fimds rate has entered\n\nthe neutral range and risen to the upper end of that range as estimated by most analysts, it\n\nhas become more difficult to know in advance what the next move is likely to be or when\nthe next move should occur.\nCurrently, as I have described, the economy is operating at or near full resource\n\nutilization, output is projected to grow at roughly the economy’s growth potential over\nthe course of the year, and core inflation is projected to remain relatively low and stable.\nIn addition, the risks to the outlook are balanced, and the funds rate has returned to a\n\nmore normal level.\n\nGiven lags in the effects of monetary policy on the economy, however, we cannot\nbe sure how our past policy actions will impact the economy down the road. We\n\ntherefore will need to carefully examine incoming data for signs of inflationary pressure\nor economic weakness and be prepared to take appropriate action. Because economic\n\ndata often give ambiguous signals, we must go cautiously, watching the new information\nto confirm where we are in the current economic and policy cycle and that we not tighten\npolicy too much, thus, needlessly slowing the economy below potential. That said,\nbalance requires that long-run inflation expectations remain well anchored if price\n\nstability is to be maintained.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me conclude by saying that I expect we will continue to enjoy solid economic\ngrowth with low inflation throughout 2006. Output likely will grow at or slightly above\nthe economy’s long-run growth potential. With the possibility of increased resource\n\n\f11\n\nutilization and the pass-though of higher energy prices to core inflation, there is a risk\nthat inflationary pressures could build. At the same time, there are also risks—though\n\nperhaps small—that a decline in housing prices or a disorderly adjustment to our trade\n\nimbalance could cause a pullback in consumer spending. In this environment, we will\n\nneed to carefully monitor incoming data and take necessary actions to keep the risks to\nthe attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in\n\nbalance.\n\n\f"

            "content": "THE NATIONAL ECONOMY .AND MONETARY POLICY\nIN THE NEW YEAR\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nKansas City, Missouri\nJanuary 9, 2006\n\n\f2\n\nI’m pleased to be back at the Central Exchange to speak with you about the\noutlook for 2006 and implications for monetary policy. With the start of the New Year,\nit’s a particularly opportune tinre to reflect on the past year and to anticipate the\n\nopportunities and challenges that the current year might bring. Some of you might recall\nthat I spoke here a year ago, providing rny perspective otr the U.S. economy for 2005.\n\nFortunately, last year, my crystal ball proved reliable, and the year unfolded largely as I\n\nexpected.\n\nToday, I would like to review the performance of the economy in 2005 and take a\nlook at some of the fundamental forces that will be shaping the outlook in 2006. I also\n\nwould like to give you rny perspective on monetary policy over the period ahead. I\nhope—but can’t guarantee—that my crystal ball will prove as reliable this year as it did\n\nlast year.\n\nLooking back at 2005\n\nLet me begin by taking a look back at the year just ended. While we don’t yet\nhave GDP data for the fourth quarter, it appears the economy experienced solid growth\nthroughout the year. In the first three quarters of the year, the economy grew at an annual\n\nrate of 3.7 percent. This strong growth—which is above most estimates of the economy’s\nlong-run growth potential—largely closed the output gap and returned the economy close\n\nto frill resource utilization. For example, the unemployment rate fell horn 5.4 percent hr\n\nDecember of 2004 to 4.9 percent in December of last year, and capacity utilization in\nmanufacturing edged up. This growth rate was also close to the forecast of 3'/? to 4\n\npercent that I gave here last year.\n\n\f3\n\nAll major components of domestic demand contributed to this performance.\nConsumer and business spending remained robust, and residential investment spending\n\nactually accelerated a bit relative to the previous year. The only major sector not\ncontributing significantly to overall growth was the foreign trade sector, where we\n\ncontinued to see large deficits. But, depending on what happened in the fourth quarter,\neven that sector likely has been less of a drag on growth than hi previous years.\n\nOn the inflation front, the news was also reasonably good. Although there was a\nsignificant impact of higher energy prices on overall inflation, the core inflation rate\n\nremained relatively low and stable. On a year-over-year basis, the overall CPI rose by\n\n316 percent in November of last year. But, the CPI excluding food and energy prices rose\na more modest 2.1 percent. This outcome was consistent with what I expected last year\n\nat this time. Although last year I mentioned a number of factors that made me cautious\nabout the outlook for inflation, my expectation was that core inflation would remain\nstable.\n\nNow, before I get carried away with my forecasting ability, let me acknowledge\nthat last year I obviously was not anticipating the disruption to economic activity caused\n\nby hurricanes Katrina and Rita or the spike in energy prices they precipitated. Indeed, the\nlong-run outlook for oil and gas prices has changed dramatically since this time last year.\n\nHad the hurricanes not struck, I suspect economic growth might have come in even\nstronger than I was anticipating last year, and, certainly, overall inflation would have\ncome in lower.\n\nOne of the factors that contributed to the solid economic performance last year\nwas the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Although the Federal Open Market\n\n\f4\nCommittee (FOMC) raised the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each\n\nof our eight meetings last year, for most of the year, the rate remained below the level\nmost analysts would describe as neutral. A neutral funds rate is one that neither over­\n\nstimulates nor restrains overall economic activity. Although no one knows exactly what\nlevel of the funds rate is consistent with neutrality, we clearly did not approach the\nneutral range until late in 2005. Recall that at the beginning of the year, the funds rate\n\nwas just 2% percent in nominal terms and zero percent after adjusting for inflation.\n\nToday, it is 414 percent in nominal terms and just over 2 percent after inflation. So,\nthroughout most—if not all—of 2005, monetary policy remained accommodative.\n\nLooking ahead at 2006\nLooking ahead, I expect the favorable performance of the economy to continue.\nMost private forecasters expect the momentum from the solid growth in 2005 to continue\n\ninto 2006. Although monetary policy has become less accommodative, it will continue to\nsupport economic activity. Because of the lags with which monetary policy affects the\n\neconomy, monetary policy accommodation over the past year will continue to act as an\n\neconomic stimulant, though clearly far less so than hr the past several years. My sense is\nthat most forecasters expect growth of around 3% percent (Q4/Q4) for 2006, winch is just\n\nslightly above most estimates of trend GDP growth. My own view is that we will see\ngrowth in the 314 to 314 percent range, which encompasses the consensus estimate.\n\nAs in 2005, consumer spending is expected to be a primary contributor to growth\nin 2006. In recent months, consumer confidence measures have sharply rebounded from\n\nthe hurricane-related decline last fall. More importantly, consumer expectations of the\n\nfuture are positive. One possible drag on consumption lies in the persistence of high\n\n\f5\nenergy prices, especially for natural gas. High utility prices for heating are expected to\n\nconstrain spending somewhat during the winter months. This drag should diminish by\nspring as heating demands decline and production in the Gulf region is more fully\n\nrestored. Overall, I expect to see consumption growth of around 3 percent for 2006.\nDespite the upheavals in several sectors of the economy, such as the auto\n\nindustry, business investment is also expected to contribute to growth in 2006. Strong\n\ngrowth of corporate earnings combined with low borrowing costs over the past two years\nhave led to marked improvement in firms' balance sheets. In the first three quarters of\n\n2005, corporate profits were nearly 15 percent higher than the year-earlier period.\n\nLooking ahead, while there may be some slowing from recent performance, most private\nsector forecasters expect profit growth of around 8 percent in 2006. Together, improved\n\nbalance sheets and strong profit growth will provide fundamental support for investment\nspending.\n\nIn the international sector, continued strong growth in the rest of the world will\nslow the growth of the trade deficit. An expanding world economy is expected by many\neconomists to generate increasing demand for U.S. exports. Such growth, however, is\n\nalso likely to further increase global demand for natural resources. This implies that\nprices for commodities such as oil may remain at elevated levels for an extended period.\nThe solid growth forecast for the economy also should translate into steady\n\ngrowth in employment. The increases will be somewhat less than employment gains seen\nin the past two years due to two factors. First, as growth slows and converges toward the\n\neconomy’s trend growth rate, fewer additional workers will be needed. And second,\nstrong productivity growth over the past few years is expected to continue, suggesting\n\n\f6\nthat the existing workforce will be able to produce a sizeable portion of the projected\n\nincrease in output. Based on these factors, I would expect that employment will glow\nbetween 1.5 and 2 million in 2006.\n\nTurning to inflation. I expect the core inflation rate to remain low. Thus far, the\n\nimpact of higher energy prices on the core measure of CPI inflation has been moderate.\nHowever, the longer energy prices remain at elevated levels, the greater the probability\nthat these higher costs will be passed on from producers to consumers. For 2006,1\nexpect these energy price pressures to result in a modest increase of core inflation in the\n\nfirst half of the year before diminishing in the second half.\nRisks to the outlook\n\nWith the general performance of the economy outlined, let me next discuss what I\nsee as the major risks for the U.S economic outlook. Over the past year, the economy\n\nagain has displayed its resilience to economic shocks. In first half of 2005, we\nexperienced a sharp run-up in energy prices, hi the second half, we faced the devastating\n\nimpacts of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which led to an additional increase in energy\n\nprices. Throughout these events, the economy has continued its robust growth, and\nrelated inflation pressures appear to have been temporary. Despite the excellent\nperformance of the economy in the wake of these events, it is important that we continue\nto be on the lookout for potential problems ahead.\nThe primary near-term concern pertains to the upside risks for the economy and\n\ninflation. If global demand continues to accelerate, total resource demands could\nincrease as well. As mentioned earlier, the increase in energy prices may lead to higher\ncore inflation if higher energy costs are passed on by businesses to consumers. In\n\n\f7\n\naddition, if the U.S. economy continues expanding at a rate faster than underlying trend\ngrowth, the pool of available workers will shrink. Such expansion eventually should\nresult in higher labor costs. Thus far, we have yet to see rapid growth in wages. Over the\n\npast year, unit labor costs have increased by only 2 percent. But looking forward,\nmeasures of wage pressures and total resource demands will require care fill monitoring as\nthe economy continues to grow.\nA second, longer-term concern relates to the current low savings rate in the\n\nUnited States. For seven of the past eight months, the personal savings rate has been\nnegative. So while busmesses have been improving their balance sheets as a result of\n\nstrong earnings growth, consumer debt has been increasing as consumers have spent in\n\nexcess of their incomes. The picture for government savings is not any better due to the\ncurrent large federal budget deficit. Combined, strong consumer and government\n\ndemand have caused imports to exceed exports, resulting over time in the large U.S. trade\ndeficit. To finance this trade deficit, foreigners have acquired large holdings of U.S.\n\nsecurities. At some point, the domestic savings rate must increase to reduce this hade\nimbalance. Many economists expect that the transition to a higher savings rate will occur\n\nsmoothly, but with an imbalance of this magnitude, there is the low probability that a\nrapid hansition could lead to a downturn hi the economy through a shaip falloff in\n\nconsumption.\nA third concern relates to a possible imbalance in asset prices. Over the past\n\nseveral years, there has been a rapid increase in the value of housing in the United States\nfueled by low mortgage interest rates. This has increased household wealth and\ncontributed to strong growth hi household consumption during the current economic\n\n\f8\nexpansion. If housing prices have risen above levels dictated by economic fundamentals,\n\nthere is a chance that prices could fall. With the current low savings rate and high debt\nlevel of consumers, such a drop in household wealth would have negative implications\n\nfor the economy. While I do not think there is much risk of a significant housing price\ndecline on a nationwide basis, we could see a decline in prices in certain markets.\nThese tluee factors present both upside and downside risks to the economy. As\nthe economy nears the point of full utilization of resources, it will become more\n\nchallenging to set a course for monetary policy that appropriately balances these risks.\n\nImplications for monetary policy\n\nThat brings me to the final part of my presentation: the role of monetary policy in\nfostering sustainable economic growth with price stability. Over the course of the last\n\nyear and a half the FOMC gradually has raised its target for the federal funds rate from\nan unusually low level of 1 percent hi 2004 to 414 percent today. As a result of these\nactions, the funds rate now has returned to a more normal level and is within at least the\n\nlower range of what most analysts associate with neutrality. Whether the funds rate is\n\nnow precisely at the point within the neutral range where it needs to be is a question I\ncannot answer with any degree of certainty. This depends on possible increases in\n\nresource utilization as well as elevated energy prices, and whether other factors add to\ninflation pressures.\nMore generally, when the funds rate is within the neutral range, as I believe it is\n\nnow, changes in the funds rate target become more dependent on incoming economic\n\ndata and on anecdotal information on economic activity and inflation. If such evidence\nwere to suggest that core inflation was increasing above the level associated with price\n\n\f9\n\nstability, it might be necessary to move the binds rate target higher within the range of\nneutrality. Or, depending on the extent of upward price pressure, it might be necessary to\n\nmove the funds rate above the neutral range to offset the tendency for inflation to rise.\n\nOne indicator that would be of particular concern to me would be any upward movement\nin long-mn inflation expectations. It is essential for long-run inflation expectations to\n\nremain well anchored if price stability is to be maintained.\n\nIn contrast, if incoming evidence suggested the expansion were faltering, it might\nbe necessary to adjust the funds rate downward. As I suggested earlier, the burden of\n\nhigh energy prices or a desire by consumers to curtail their spending could lead to a\n\nslower-growth scenario. Depending on the outlook for inflation in such a scenario, it\nmight be appropriate to move the bmds rate lower within the neutral range or, potentially,\n\nbelow neutral to help stimulate spending and production.\nOn balance, while the current setting of monetary policy may be close to where it\nwill ultimately need to be, we won’t know this until new data are reported. The point is\n\nthat we still must monitor closely incoming information as we seek to calibrate our policy\n\nin the months ahead.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me conclude by saying that I expect we will continue to enjoy solid economic\ngrowth with low inflation throughout 2006. Output will likely grow at or slightly above\nthe economy’s long-run growth potential. With the possibility of increased resource\nutilization and the pass-though of higher energy prices to core inflation, there is a risk\n\nthat inflationary pressures could build. In this environment, we will need to monitor\n\n\f10\n\ncarefully incoming data and take necessary actions to keep the risks to the attainment of\nboth sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.\n\n\f"
