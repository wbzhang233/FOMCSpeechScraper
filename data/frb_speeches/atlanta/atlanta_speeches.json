International trade has played an increasingly important role in the U.S.\neconomy. Reasonable debate about trade policies needs to be informed by the full picture, not\nby a single-minded focus on either costs or benefits alone.\n• Bostic: Assessing the impact of international trade is difficult, and assessing the effect of trade\npolicy can be even more so. For example, the uncertainty touched off by trade restrictions can\neasily affect firms’ decision making.\n• Bostic notes that the fields of economics and finance lack diversity, with women and minorities\nunderrepresented. To increase diversity, he says we should introduce students to economic\ndecision-making during the earliest days of their education. Federal Reserve staff are creating\nengaging lessons for elementary school teachers to use to introduce key economic concepts\nto the youngest students.\n• Bostic: When the economy is doing well and standing on its own, as it is now, I think monetary\npolicy ought to be moving toward a neutral stance.\n\nFacebook Watch\n\nIt's a pleasure to be with you at this forum today. I think we can all agree that basic knowledge and information about how to fully participate in the\nfinancial system are essential to the success of our economy.\nAs many of you know, we have a program at the Atlanta Fed that focuses on economic and financial literacy. Critical to that program are partnerships\nwith organizations like the Mississippi Council on Economic Education. My colleague Adrienne Slack's presence on your board of directors and the\nprograms and workshops that Claire Loup and the council work on together demonstrate our commitment to this partnership and our shared mission of\neconomic and financial literacy.\nThe Atlanta Fed supports these efforts across the six states in our District. For example, I spoke with economics teachers at Florida Gulf Coast\nUniversity in Fort Myers, Florida, on financial literacy and economic opportunity this past spring, and our Bank is a longtime partner of the Georgia\nCouncil on Economic Education. I've learned a lot from those experiences and have seen some inspirational things. So it's an honor to talk with you\ntoday.\nToday I want to talk about economic education and the important role that it plays in our civic lives. This is a soapbox issue for me, and I will try not to be\ntoo preachy. But it's too important to ignore, and so I'm going to lean in on it. I will emphasize two aspects of economic education. First, I will highlight its\nimportance for an issue of current policy concern—international trade. It is clearly a contentious and complex topic, but that makes it an excellent\nexample of how equipping students with the basic tools of economic reasoning can enhance the public debate and, ultimately, consensus building.\nSecond, I want to discuss economic education in the context of what I see as unfortunate facts: the economic profession is not often enough the field of\nchoice for some of our best and brightest, and it remains stubbornly unrepresentative of the population. I think all of us with a passion for advancing\neconomic education and literacy should work hard to ensure that we increase the pool of young people who find economics interesting and exciting and\nthat we add diversity to the profession. I'll close my remarks with a few brief comments on the economy and policy.\nAs always, the views I'll offer are mine alone. I don't speak for the Federal Open Market Committee (or FOMC) or for any other Fed official.\nThe important role of economic education and understanding trade\nI'll begin, then, with my first point: the importance of economic education in our civic lives in the context of international trade, and I'd like to start with a\nstory.\nLast month, I participated in an event with the World Affairs Council on NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Agreement. One of the attendees\nasked me why trade matters for monetary policy, and I talked through the issues with her. Her gratitude, and admission that she had not heard this\nbefore, surprised me, and made it clear that more needs to be done to explain the basics of international trade and why it matters to a monetary\npolicymaker. So I will try to make progress on that front today.\nForeign trade has played an increasingly important role in the U.S. economy over time. Over the past 30 years, the value of U.S. exports—the goods and\nservices we sell to the rest of the world—has risen by about $2 trillion in today's dollars. Imports—the goods and services we buy from the rest of the\nworld—have increased by $2.5 trillion over that same period. As a result, almost 28 percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) is now linked\n\n\fto the international trade of goods and services.\nThis growing international dimension has important ramifications for how the U.S. economy operates. For example, even though the largest share of\nconsumer spending goes to goods that are produced in the United States, imported components are often used in the production process. Hence, part of\nthe spending on items \"Made in the USA\" also pays for imported components and services.\nHere in Mississippi, we need only look at the automotive industry to see that force in action. From major auto assembly plants operated by Nissan and\nToyota to vehicle parts suppliers scattered across the state, the industry relies on a global supply chain to bring products to U.S. consumers quickly and\nefficiently.\nAt the same time, when someone buys something labeled \"Made in China,\" that doesn't mean all of the retail price goes back to the Chinese producer.\nThere are all kinds of local content going into that retail price, including some fraction of the profits, rent, marketing, distribution, and transportation costs,\nas well as the wages paid to workers here in the United States.\nSome imported products, like cell phones, even contain components that were produced in the United States and then exported to a foreign\nmanufacturer for assembly. Foreign trade linkages are complex and not readily transparent.\nThe impact of trade on jobs can be similarly complex. While jobs are created and supported as a result of foreign trade, other jobs are at risk because of\nthe competitive pressure of foreign production.\nRegarding jobs at risk, think back to the decline of the cut-and-sew apparel industry in Mississippi during the 1990s to recognize that the disruption\ncaused by new foreign competition can be dramatic. On the other hand, the Southeast's foreign auto plants, for example, have grown to be important\nexporters of vehicles to places like China, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Mexico, and the Middle East.\nIf assessing the impact of international trade is difficult, assessing the effect of trade policy can be even more difficult. Economic reasoning tells us that\nwhat might happen in the future can affect behavior every bit as much as what is happening today. In practical terms this means, for example, that the\nuncertainty touched off by the imposition of trade restrictions can easily affect firms' decision-making, independent of the direct effects of the restrictions\nthemselves.\nIn a recent macroblog post published on our website, my staff at the Atlanta Fed reported on the results of a survey that asked whether firms are\nreassessing their capital investment plans in light of recent tariff hikes and fears of retaliation. An uncertain outlook can cause firms to delay investments\nwhile they wait to see how the situation unfolds. Such a development could grow to have macroeconomic ramifications the longer the uncertainty\nremains.\nThe survey results showed that about one-fifth of the firms surveyed in July say they are reassessing their capital spending plans in light of tariff worries.\nBut only 6 percent report they are actually cutting spending or deferring previous plans in reaction to tariff worries. These findings suggest that tariff\nworries have had only a small negative effect on U.S. business investment so far.\nStill, there are reasons for concern. First, 30 percent of manufacturing firms report they are reassessing their capital expenditure plans because of tariff\nworries, and manufacturing is highly capital intensive. So the investment effects of trade policy frictions are concentrated in a sector that accounts for a\nsubstantial share of business investment.\nSecond, 12 percent of the firms report they have placed previously planned capital expenditures under review. Third, trade policy tensions between the\nUnited States and China have only escalated recently. The negative effects of sustained tariff worries on U.S. business investment could easily grow.\nGlobal interconnectedness is a fact. Its effects—and the effects of policies aimed at altering the landscape of international trade—are far from\nstraightforward. The distinction between \"Made in America\" and \"Made in China\" is not always clear-cut. Trade poses competitive threats to many\nbusinesses and workers, but also has clear benefits for many others.\nTrade policies are not implemented in a vacuum, and perceptions of how our trading partners will respond to our actions can either accentuate or\ncounteract the policies' intended effects. Reasonable debate about trade policies needs to be informed by the full picture. We will only talk past one\nanother by pursuing a single-minded focus on either the costs or the benefits of trade and trade policy alone.\nThis is precisely why the work all of you do to promote economic education really matters to our nation's future. We need the voices of informed\nconsumers to help shape effective policies and practices that are grounded in factual analysis and sound economic basics.\nThe case of international trade I have been discussing is just one example. Other questions that are vital to our collective futures include the effects of\nfiscal deficits and options for addressing them, the causes and consequences of wealth and income inequality, the case for and against independent\nmonetary policy, and the value of market interventions of various sorts. In my view, basic economic literacy is the necessary foundation for\nunderstanding, let alone addressing, the challenges these questions pose.\nDiversity in economics and finance\nI'd like to use the balance of my time to share a few thoughts about a challenge we are facing in the field of economics—one that we need your help in\naddressing. It is widely recognized that the fields of economics and finance lack diversity, with women and minorities underrepresented among\neconomists and finance professionals.\nYou should know that, for me, this challenge is personal. I discovered economics by accident. I was a good student in math through middle and high\nschool, but had little formal schooling in economics or any kind of finance by the time I graduated. I found economics only after a particularly harrowing\nexperience in an introductory chemistry class, which led me to find other channels to pursue academically. First, I studied psychology and, after that,\neconomics. While I am very fortunate that serendipity worked in my favor in this case, I am committed to working to see that dumb luck doesn't turn out\nto be the field's main recruitment strategy.\nIn thinking about the lack of diversity in my profession, one explanation I have gravitated toward is that the pool of minority and women candidates\ncoming to the market on an annual basis is too small to make a dent in longstanding shortfalls. For example, there were fewer than 25 African American\neconomics doctoral students on the market for U.S. junior academic economic positions this year. That's 25 total. With numbers this small, it is unlikely\nthat the vast majority of institutions could become measurably more diverse, even when devoting significant energy and resources toward this goal.\n\n\fI think we need to focus on both improving instruction and becoming more targeted in our approach. To improve instruction, we should build on the\noutstanding work of partners like the Mississippi Council for Economic Education to strengthen the instruction of economics and personal finance among\nhigh school students. As you know, the council partnered with the Mississippi Department of Education to create master teacher programs in economics\nand in entrepreneurship. Both of these are state-endorsed certificate programs for secondary social studies and business education teachers.\nThis year, the Atlanta Fed and the St. Louis Fed partnered with the council to develop a \"master teacher in personal finance\" program, one that I hope\nwill become another state-endorsed certificate for Mississippi's teachers. After a successful pilot this summer, the curriculum is being finalized and\nreadied for implementation. I strongly support these types of certification programs because they equip and empower teachers to provide engaging\ninstruction that excites students.\nRegarding developing targeted approaches, the Financial Services Pipeline Initiative in Chicago has found that African Americans' and Latinos' interest\nin working in the financial services industry often crystallizes during the high school years, compared to college years for whites.\nThis suggests that, to increase diversity, we should introduce students to economic decision-making much earlier, during the earliest days of their\neducation. In that spirit, economic education staff across the Federal Reserve System are creating engaging lessons that elementary school teachers\ncan use to introduce key economic concepts to the youngest students. This approach strengthens students' ability to make good decisions and engage\nwith the economic systems that will lead to a lifetime of better economic outcomes.\nI am actively working with my colleagues across the System to develop a program to help address these issues. We are in the early stages, but I think\nwe can build on our existing programs and deepen partnerships like the one we have with the Mississippi Council on Economic Education to spark the\nimagination of all students, but especially female and minority students, to pursue a career in economics and finance.\nLet's be sure to continue to promote the economics profession as a place where bright, curious people from all backgrounds can roll up their sleeves to\nhelp solve real problems that affect individuals, businesses, and nations.\nFinally, let me say a few words about the economy and policy. As you may be aware, the FOMC has two mandated objectives: maximum sustainable\nemployment and price stability, which the Federal Reserve has defined as 2 percent inflation. Relative to both of those objectives, the economy is\nperforming quite well.\nThe unemployment rate is low relative to historical standards and has been at or below 4 percent since the spring. You'd have to go back nearly 20 years\nto find a similar performance. This suggests we are at, or at least very close to, full employment.\nGDP growth in recent years has been quite robust, helping to support the strong labor market performance we are enjoying. The recent economic data\nsuggest that output growth is likely to continue at an above-trend pace in the current quarter. One particularly bright spot has been consumer spending,\nwhich rebounded sharply in the second quarter, and looks similarly strong currently.\nAgainst the backdrop of a full-employment economy, we have also moved much closer to our price-stability mandate. Underlying measures of inflation\nsuch as the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index and the Dallas Fed's trimmed-mean price index both hit 2 percent in July. There\nis little evidence to suggest that inflation is accelerating materially beyond this.\nWhen the economy is doing well and standing on its own, as it is now, I think monetary policy ought to be moving toward a neutral stance. For me, this\nmeans a gradual increase in nominal interest rates over the next handful of quarters.\nThanks, and now I'll be glad to take some questions.\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nPDF version • Raphael Bostic's biography • Speakers Bureau\n\nContact: Marc Fordham 404-498-7324\n\n\f"

Bostic has challenged his Atlanta Fed colleagues to\nbuild momentum toward this goal.\nIt's a pleasure to be with you at this awards luncheon today. These award-winning teachers exemplify the committed educators across this nation who\nequip students with tools and information to help them meet their full potential and ultimately contribute to the success of our nation.\nThe issue of economic education is one that has been a soapbox of mine, which is why I was pleased to learn upon arriving in Atlanta last year that our\nBank has taken a leadership role in developing the economic and financial literacy of students throughout the Southeast. We are committed to\nsupporting teachers through professional development programs and the creation of classroom-ready resources. As you saw in the new video a few\nmoments ago, Reserve Banks across the Federal Reserve System engage educators through similar endeavors. I am proud of this work.\nIn addition, our work in the Sixth Federal Reserve District would not be possible without committed external partners. Being in Atlanta, I think it's\nappropriate to give a shout-out to the Georgia Council on Economic Education, led by Mike Raymer, with whom we have had a successful and\nlongstanding partnership. Thanks to Mike and his team for all they do to help advance our goals.\nBut we are equally grateful for the outstanding relationships with our partners at other state councils and centers across the Sixth District, many of whom\nare here today. At the national level, the System Economic Education group partners with the Council for Economic Education. Nan Morrison, the\nSystem is grateful for your contributions to the Centennial Advisory Council. And I know that my colleague Loretta Mester, the president and CEO of the\nCleveland Fed, is pleased to serve on the Council's board of directors.\nToday I want to talk about economic education from two perspectives. First, I will highlight its importance for current policy, including some thoughts on\nlast week's Federal Open Market Committee (or FOMC) meeting. Second, I'll offer a few comments on how I'm seeing current economic conditions.\nThird, I want to discuss economic education and your role in introducing young people to the discipline of economics.\nAs always, the views I'll offer are mine alone. I don't speak for the FOMC or for any other Fed official.\nA view on the FOMC and policy\nSpeaking of the FOMC, I thought I might start my remarks by trying to shed some light on what happens at a Committee meeting and how I prepare for\nit. I'm guessing you are familiar with the nuts and bolts of how the Committee is structured, so I thought I might talk a little inside baseball.\nAs you know, the FOMC meets eight times a year, roughly every six to eight weeks, to determine the appropriate stance of policy. At each meeting,\nevery Committee participant offers his or her perspective of current national and local economic and financial conditions, what the policy path moving\nforward should look like, and the risks associated with that outlook.\nEvery Fed governor and president has the floor twice, and I will never forget the first time the floor was mine. Statements are often written out in\nadvance, so that the transcript reflects the precise ideas an FOMC participant seeks to convey, and I had taken this approach. This being my first foray\ninto the process, I wanted to be extra sure everything was precise and on point.\n\n\fNormally, when I read a statement, I try to make it sound conversational, with emphases and pauses for effect. So I was going along and got to one of\nthose pause moments, and when I paused, the room was completely silent. I had done a lot of speaking in front of people, much of that time, like you, in\nfront of a class. In most of those instances, though, I knew that some small fraction of my audience was not listening or paying attention. You know\nexactly what I mean here.\nNow, here I was, speaking before a very important monetary policy institution that included some titans of economics, such as Janet Yellen and Stan\nFischer, and everyone was laser focused on me and what I was saying. To be honest, it was a bit nerve-wracking. Terrifying, actually. But I managed to\nget through it and, in time, have gotten more used to it. It is truly an honor and privilege to have an opportunity to contribute to policy in this way.\nTo prepare for the FOMC meetings, my staff and I have frequent, ongoing conversations about the national economic picture, the output of a variety of\neconomic and statistical forecasting models, and any academic research that may prove useful in understanding all the aspects of the current\nenvironment.\nOut of these ongoing conversations, my staff has developed quite a few interesting tools to help us analyze economic developments. We have even\nmade public some of the tools that we have found particularly useful.\nPerhaps the most well-known of these tools is one we use to get an early indication of current-quarter gross domestic product (GDP). Our GDPNow\nforecasting model provides a \"nowcast\" of the official GDP estimate before its release, using a methodology similar to the one used by the U.S. Bureau\nof Economic Analysis.\nGDPNow is not an official forecast of the Atlanta Fed. Rather, it is best viewed as a running estimate of real GDP growth based on available data for the\ncurrent measured quarter. There are no subjective adjustments made to GDPNow—the estimate is based solely on the mathematical results of the\nmodel.\nOther tools we have developed include our Wage Growth Tracker, which is a measure of nominal wage growth that is less susceptible to changes in the\nmakeup of the workforce than average hourly earnings. As a result, it may give us a cleaner reading on wage pressure.\nAnd we've also developed survey tools like the Business Inflation Expectations survey, which helps us better understand and track the inflation\nexpectations of businesses.\nThese are just a few of the many tools economists at the Atlanta Fed have developed to better understand the economy—and they're free. So, in a\nshameless plug, go check out our website at frbatlanta.org.\nBut I don't just rely on national statistics, economic models, and input from my research staff. The Atlanta Fed has also built an extensive network of\nbusiness contacts, community groups, and nonprofit organizations that we affectionately call REIN—or the Regional Economic Information Network.\nInsights from this REIN network help me paint a broader picture of the health of the economy than I could capture with economic models alone. With the\naid of these Main Street perspectives, I can dig into puzzling developments in the macroeconomic data, get a different perspective on the challenges that\nbusinesspeople in my district are confronting, and gain some visibility into their expectations for the future.\nCurrent economic outlook\nNow that you've gotten a peek behind the curtain, let me briefly turn to my current economic outlook. The incoming economic data on the real side of the\neconomy have come in stronger than I had been expecting earlier this year. So much stronger, in fact, that the central question in my mind is whether the\napparent strength in GDP and job growth is a signal that I have materially underestimated the underlying momentum of aggregate demand. If that's the\ncase, the potential for overheating would require a higher path for rates than what I had been thinking.\nGiven the particular challenge of interpreting these data at the moment, what is likely to happen and what does this imply for policy? I've been leaning\nheavily on my REIN network and Bank directors to glean some useful signals on the likely forward path of the economy.\nThese business leaders have struck a largely upbeat tone regarding the current environment, with the majority reporting that demand roughly matched or\nwas slightly above their expectations. That said, my contacts generally indicated that they have not materially revised their outlooks for the remainder of\n2018 and 2019.\nThis sentiment is especially true regarding expectations of future capital investment spending. This is puzzling, as economic and statistical models would\nassess the recent trajectory of investment growth and project a further acceleration in investment spending, especially against a backdrop of recent tax\nreform and fiscal stimulus.\nSo we delved into this issue during conversations with our contacts. The responses were a little varied, but they had one unifying theme: Businesses'\ninvestment strategies are driven by demand fundamentals. In this environment, business leaders have not yet bought into a significant persistent pickup\nin demand beyond their current capabilities to meet that demand.\nUncertainty regarding tariffs and trade policy remains a feature of the economic landscape, but I get the sense that business leaders have become\ninured to the seemingly endless string of day-to-day fluctuations in the business environment. So much so, that it is dampening their reactions to good\nnews as well.\nTurning to the consumer, the recent data point to a pickup in household spending. However, I think it is noteworthy that much of this recent strength has\nnot been in goods that are associated with longer-term commitments, such as autos and large appliances. A reasonable interpretation of this behavior is\nthat households are exercising prudence, not wanting to take big, irreversible bets. And it is in this light that I view the personal saving rate, which has\nremained elevated relative to its average over the previous expansion. So, despite high levels of sentiment and improved balance sheets, households,\nlike businesses, are continuing forward with caution.\nOn inflation, I see retail prices continuing to increase at about a 2 percent pace.\nConsistent with aggregate measures of wage growth, reports from my district suggest some firming in labor costs. A growing number of firms across the\nDistrict reported an uptick in merit increases, averaging in the 3 to 3.5 percent range.\n\n\fFurther, there was a marked uptick in the reported ability of firms to pass on cost increases. This was especially true for firms subject to tariff- and freightrelated cost increases. Those firms reported little to no pushback when passing along rising costs to their customers. But I get the sense that the\nphenomenon is becoming more widespread. It's a development that I will continue to watch closely.\nIn sum, the current economic growth picture looks bright, but businesses in my district, at least, appear to be exercising a healthy dose of restraint\nregarding the outlook. Inflation is currently running very near the FOMC's price stability target of 2 percent and appears poised to continue to do so.\nBased on that assessment of the health of the economy and its likely path forward, last week I voted with my colleagues on the FOMC to raise the\nfederal funds target range by 25 basis points to 2 to 2.25 percent.\nCurrent conditions suggest, to me, that we ought to get to a policy stance where our foot is neither on the gas pedal—what we call an accommodative\npolicy—nor on the brakes—what we call a restrictive policy. Such a neutral policy position would allow the economy to stand on its own.\nThe importance of early economic education\nNow I'd like to turn to a topic about which I am passionate—and one that we need your help in addressing. We need a far deeper pool of young people to\nsee economics, banking, and finance as desirable career paths. Without a deep and diverse workforce, our fields suffer. For example, ideas are\nchallenged less often and conventional wisdoms can persist, even when they're wrong. So we need to make sure a strong pathway exists for people to\nlearn about, and be excited by, economics and finance.\nI take myself as an example. I discovered economics by accident, only after I had a scary experience in an introductory chemistry class, which led me to\nfind other channels to pursue academically. First, I studied psychology and after that, economics. This path worked for me, but I'd rather see people\ncome to this profession by choice rather than chance.\nIt seems to me that early exposure to the economic way of thinking, and explanations of how economics is useful and important for everyday life, are\ncritical. One approach that the Council has advocated is for all states to require that high school students take a dedicated economics course. As you\nknow, the Council's latest Survey of the States found that less than half the states require high school students to take an economics course. Only 16 of\nthose states have a state-mandated test of economic concepts, a number that has not moved since 2014. So there remains work to do here.\nA second approach is to push for states and school districts to introduce, and perhaps mandate, economics courses and modules in the grades leading\nup to high school. In Georgia, the history of a standalone economics course that is validated with a meaningful state test has driven a focus on\neconomics at every grade level from K through 8. And it has been accompanied by levels of success by African-American students in advanced\nplacement economics courses that outpace the national average.\nIt is my goal that the Federal Reserve play a leading role in this latter effort. This summer, my staff started working with Fed staff in St. Louis and others\nto develop strategies for the creation of new curricula and teaching modules for grades K through 12 and content to fill them. My hope is that these\nefforts result in materials that are promulgated nationwide and certified by states as exemplary tools that are then adopted by school systems across the\nUnited States. I hope the Council's network serves as a powerful partner in helping us with this, so that together we empower educators to ignite\nstudents' passion and imagination.\nThe time has come to equip a cadre of K through 12 teachers across this country to reach students from every background, in every school, so that their\ndiscovery of economics is not accidental, like mine. I encourage you to join us in this pursuit.\nThanks, and now I'll be glad to take some questions.\n\nContact: Marc Fordham 404-498-7324\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nPDF version • Raphael Bostic's biography • Speakers Bureau\n\n\f"

However, he says\ncaution remains with firms and households regarding longer-term investments.\n• Bostic: The potential for changes in trade policy to affect the costs of production—through either direct tariffs, supply-chain disruptions, or firms\nswitching to higher-cost routes to import supplies—remains a risk to his inflation outlook.\n• Citing Atlanta Fed research, he cautions against letting the economy slip too far into high-pressure periods that ultimately impose heavy costs on\nmany people across the economy. Facilitating a prolonged period of low—and sustainable—unemployment rates is a far more beneficial\napproach.\n• Bostic believes that, in the current environment, the Fed should shift into a neutral monetary policy stance. While there is some uncertainty\nsurrounding estimates of neutral, his assessment is that we are still a few rate hikes away.\nI'm delighted to be in Baton Rouge and to join you at this business roundtable today. I know the Louisiana Committee of 100 shares the Atlanta Fed's\ngoal of fostering economic prosperity for everyone in our communities.\nThe work you have championed to improve regional workforce development at the Cyber Innovation Center and early childhood care and education\nthrough the Louisiana Early Childhood Business Roundtable are just two examples of where your efforts dovetail with ours.\nI'd like to recognize two folks attending this afternoon: Jude Melville of Business First Bank is a member of the Atlanta Fed's Community Depository\nInstitutions Advisory Council, and Stephen or \"Stevie\" Toups of Turner Industries is a member of our Energy Advisory Council. Thank you both for being\nhere and for your service to our Bank.\nBefore I get too far into my remarks, I'd like to do a commercial. As many of you may know, we have an outreach program at the Atlanta Fed that we call\nREIN—the Regional Economic Information Network. Our regional executives, like Adrienne Slack here in Louisiana, and their staffs spend nearly all of\ntheir time out in the field, meeting with business leaders like you to get your take on economic trends, opportunities, and challenges. Through these\nmeetings, they bring me real-time, real-world stories that paint a forward-looking picture of the economies in the Sixth Federal Reserve District and help\ninform my thinking on policy directions. So I have a request for you: When Adrienne or someone from our REIN team calls you, please take the call and\nmeet with them. Only with your help can I have the best information possible when deliberating on policy.\nIn my comments today, I'd like to provide my latest view of the economy and my economic outlook. I'll share some thoughts on how my outlook has\nevolved since the beginning of the year. Then I'll offer my views on what the Federal Reserve is trying to achieve with our current monetary policy path\nand what might happen if we fail to act.\nBefore I begin, let me say that I am offering only my personal opinions today. I'm not speaking for anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or for the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\nCurrent economic conditions\nThe economy is in a good place. So good, in fact, that as I was sitting down to write this speech, I struggled to come up with sufficient variations on the\nword \"strong.\" Strong has many definitions that can describe physical prowess, the intensity of an odor or flavor, and, in physics, a type of force between\nparticles. But one definition stands out to me as particularly apt to describe the economy at this moment: strong—able to withstand great force or\npressure.\nAt the moment, there are headwinds in the form of tariffs, trade restrictions, and market volatility, each with the potential to disrupt economic activity and\nmaterially slow growth. There are also tailwinds in the form of recent tax reform and fiscal stimulus, with the potential to push economic growth up well\nbeyond its longer-run potential.\nYet, after digging through the data, consulting our economic models, and gathering a Main Street perspective from our extensive network of business\ncontacts, I come away with the sense that economic growth is on a strong trajectory. It's on solid footing and hasn't been materially pushed higher or\nlower.\nThat does not mean that the trajectory for the economy is immovable. As I will note later, there are ample reasons for a central banker like me to be\n\n\fconcerned. But, from my perspective, the economy is performing well enough to stand on its own without support from accommodative monetary policy.\nOn Friday, we will get our first reading on real gross domestic product (or GDP) in the third quarter. Many analysts expect growth in the 3 1/2 percent\nrange. Our own in-house tracking model—GDPNow—has an estimate that is slightly higher than that.\nIt's important to put that 3 1/2 percent figure in some context. Over the entire economic expansion, 37 quarters so far, real GDP growth has risen at an\nannualized rate of 2.3 percent. Given that trend, one quarter above 3 percent growth is not all that unusual. However, on the heels of the second\nquarter's 4.2 percent annualized increase in real GDP, this may suggest that the economy is shifting into a higher gear.\nEconomic outlook\nAs a result of these higher-than-expected GDP growth numbers in the second and third quarters, I've revised up my 2018 projection. I have also moved\nup my 2019 growth forecast a bit in light of the performance of the consumer over the past two quarters. But a note of caution remains with firms and\nhouseholds regarding longer-term investments.\nThat said, I do see the risks as being tilted to the upside. Should consumer spending hew to a higher growth trajectory, I suspect that would prompt firms\nto respond by ratcheting up expansionary investment.\nUncertainty from tariffs and recent changes in trade policy remain a feature of the economic landscape. That appears to be particularly true for Louisiana\nand its deep connection to oil and gas exploration. A Brookings Institution report released earlier this year identified Louisiana as highly exposed to the\ntariffs on steel and aluminum imports, ranked only behind Missouri in terms of its share of imports. So I imagine this is something you're all thinking a lot\nabout.\nHowever, by all appearances, the majority of firms have remained resilient in the face of these risks. Businesses have yet to suggest that uncertainty\nregarding tariffs and trade policy has significantly changed their plans for employment, sales revenue, or capital spending.\nCosts are the one area where I have picked up a potential impact from changes in trade policy. Firms in my district are describing an upward shift in their\ncost structure. However, we have not yet seen a significant pass-through of higher costs into the final consumer space. Inflation remains stable, hovering\naround the FOMC's 2 percent objective.\nStill, the potential for changes in trade policy to affect the costs of production—through either direct tariffs, supply-chain disruptions, or firms switching to\nhigher-cost routes to import supplies—remains a risk to my inflation outlook.\nMonetary policy: Shifting to neutral\nGiven the current strength of the economy and that retail prices are already \"on target,\" I supported the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds target\nrange to 2 to 2 1/4 percent at the September FOMC meeting. And, unless the data talk me out of it, I view a continued, gradual removal of policy\naccommodation as appropriate until we get to a neutral policy rate.\nI want to be clear here. My assessment is that monetary policy has not yet reached a neutral stance. We are still providing accommodation. Let me use\nthe analogy of driving a car: if the economy is the car and the driver is the FOMC, in my view we are still giving the economy gas at the moment. We\nhave yet to pump the brakes.\nHigh-pressure economies: A policy consideration\nHere's a picture I've been thinking a lot about lately (see the next figure). I think it explains an important conversation monetary policymakers are having\nat the moment. The blue line in the figure is the official unemployment rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The black line is what's referred to as the\nnatural rate of unemployment. This one is the current estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (or CBO).\n\n\fAs the CBO defines it, the natural rate is \"the unemployment rate that arises from all sources other than fluctuations in demand associated with business\ncycles.\" These \"other sources\" include frictions like the time it takes people to find a job or frictions due to a mismatch between the set of skills workers\ncurrently possess and the set of skills employers want to find.\nI think it is important to point out that we do not observe the natural rate directly. It's something we infer from statistical models, other labor market\nindicators, and indicators of wage and price pressure. So, there's some uncertainty about that black line, and it can be substantial. But let's set that aside\nfor the moment.\nWhen the actual unemployment rate dips below the natural rate—highlighted as the red areas in the figure—the economy has moved into what\neconomists call a \"high-pressure period.\" For simplicity, you can think of this as moving beyond full employment.\nAnd I think here's the interesting policy conundrum. What happens at the end of every high-pressure period? A recession or gray bar in the figure. The\nreal question is why. One view is that it is because monetary policy tends to take on a much more \"muscular\" stance—some might say too muscular—at\nthe end of these high-pressure periods to combat rising nominal pressures.\nThe other alternative is that the economy destabilizes when it pushes beyond its natural potential. These high-pressure periods lead to a buildup of\ncompetitive excesses, misdirected investment, and an inefficient allocation of societal resources. A recession naturally results and is needed to undo all\nthe inefficiencies that have built up during the high-pressure period.\nYet, some people suggest that deliberately running these high-pressure periods can improve outcomes for workers in communities who have been less\nattached to the labor market, such as minorities, those with lower incomes, and those living in rural communities. These workers have long had higher\nunemployment rates than other workers, and they are often the last to benefit from periods of extended economic growth.\nFor example, research has shown that the gap between the unemployment rates of minority and white workers narrows as recoveries endure. So, the\nargument goes, allowing the economy to run further and longer into these red areas on the chart provides a net benefit to these under-attached\ncommunities.\nBut the key question isn't whether the high-pressure economy brings new people from disadvantaged groups into the labor market. Rather, the right\nquestion is whether these benefits are durable in the face of the recession that appears to inevitably follow.\nThis question was explored in a research paper by Atlanta Fed economist Julie Hotchkiss and her research colleague Robert Moore. Unfortunately, they\nfound that while workers in these aforementioned communities tend to experience greater benefits from these high-pressure periods, the pain and\ndislocation associated with the aftermath of the subsequent recession is just as significant, if not more so.\nImportantly, this research tells me we ought to guard against letting the economy slip too far into these high-pressure periods that ultimately impose\nheavy costs on many people across the economy. Facilitating a prolonged period of low—and sustainable—unemployment rates is a far more beneficial\napproach.\nLet's fast forward to where we are now (see the next figure). The CBO's estimate of the natural rate is at 4.6 percent. Again, there is some uncertainty\nabout where exactly that natural rate line lies. My estimate is about 1/2 percentage point below that. And it could be even lower. Given the general\nuncertainty about that line in real time, and given the current absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, we can't completely dismiss that possibility.\nAlthough, with the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent—a 49-year low—it seems likely that we're at least at our full employment mandate.\n\n\fGoing forward, I intend to weigh the risk of acting too swiftly and choking off the expansion against the risk of having the economy overheat and get into\na situation with rising inflation and inflation expectations that would necessitate a muscular policy response. My thinking will be informed by the evolution\nof the incoming data and from what I'm able to glean from my business contacts. And while I wrestle with that choice, one thing seems clear: there is\nlittle reason to keep our foot on the gas pedal.\nInflation is at 2 percent, employment is at or near full employment, and the overall economy is strong. These are facts that are consistent with (at least)\nachieving the Fed's dual mandate. Moreover, the current data on both consumers and businesses suggests they are acting with prudence.\nHousehold incomes are rising amid continued job gains. Consumer attitudes have risen to relatively high levels. And measures of indebtedness such as\nthe debt-service ratio and the household financial obligation ratio have fallen to and remain at multi-decade lows. Together, these fundamentals would\nsuggest ample room for further acceleration in household purchases. Yet, much of the recent strength in consumer spending has been in services and\nnondurables, not in goods associated with longer-term commitments.\nTurning to the business investment picture, here, too, my sense is that growth will continue on at a moderate pace but not move markedly higher. I'm\nbasing this assessment largely on the feedback I've heard from firms in my district either through surveys or from face-to-face interactions. These\nbusiness leaders have struck a largely upbeat tone regarding the current environment, with the majority reporting that demand roughly matched or was\nslightly above their expectations. That said, my contacts generally indicated that they have not materially revised their outlooks for the remainder of 2018\nand 2019.\nEven against a backdrop of tax reform and fiscal stimulus, what we hear from business leaders is that they have not yet bought into a significant and\npersistent pickup in demand beyond their current capabilities to meet that demand.\nIn that environment, we ought to shift into neutral. While there is some uncertainty surrounding estimates of neutral, as evidenced by the latest Summary\nof Economic Projections from the FOMC, my assessment is that we are still a few rate hikes away. At that point, after our policy foot is off the gas, but\nnot on the brake, I will look to see if consumers and businesses continue to act in ways that do not suggest a buildup of excesses. If that continues, it will\ngive me confidence that the economy is on a sustainable path.\nThank you for listening, and now I would be happy to take some questions.\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nPDF version • PowerPoint presentation • Raphael Bostic's biography • Speakers Bureau\n\nContact: Marc Fordham 404-498-7324\n\n\f"

That gradual pace has become characteristic of the policy path since then.\n• Bostic points out that today, inflation is effectively at the FOMC's longer-run 2 percent objective and the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7\npercent, very close to the FOMC's goal of promoting maximum sustainable employment growth, or possibly some measure beyond.\n• In Bostic's view, conditions warrant the final steps in adopting a neutral stance of monetary policy. But he believes the FOMC must balance the\nrisks of stopping short of full normalization and risking an overheated and unstable economic environment, versus going too far and shortcircuiting an otherwise sustainable expansion.\n• Bostic says that to manage the balance between the risks of being too timid and being too aggressive in the Fed's monetary policy course, he can\nthink of no superior approach than to proceed cautiously and keep a keen eye on the data.\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak tonight. It's an honor to be among so many distinguished colleagues from across the globe.\nWe are just about a week past the latest Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, meeting. Understandably, a lot of\nattention focused on what signal the Committee might send about the near-term path of the federal funds rate.\nIn my remarks this evening, I would like to shift the focus away from the \"how many more rate moves\" question. Instead, I'm\ngoing to talk about the framework that informs my thinking about U.S. monetary policy—in terms of both where we've been and\nthe risks we might consider in defining the next phase. In particular, I'm going to address what, if any, further adjustments might\nbe needed to get to a neutral policy.\nAs you may know, these comments reflect only my own opinions. Nothing I say tonight necessarily reflects the thinking of my\nFOMC colleagues or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nReview of the path to the present\nLet's begin the story in late 2015. Just about three years ago, the FOMC began the process of normalizing its monetary policy stance. The Committee\nmoved the target range for the federal funds rate up from the near-zero floor that had been in place since December 2008. At the time, the\nunemployment rate stood at 5 percent. That's half the level it reached following the crisis.\nThe initial increase in the policy target was modest—a 25-basis-point rise—and that gradual pace has become characteristic of the policy path since\nthen. So even with the first upward adjustment in the funds rate target, policy remained extremely accommodative.\nGiven the facts on the ground, continued accommodation was fully justified. In its statement and published projections, the Committee noted that there\nwas still room for improvement in labor markets.\nPerhaps more important, inflation remained a distance from the FOMC's longer-run price stability objective. At the time, core inflation was expected to\ncome in well below 2 percent for 2015, and to not recover fully until this year. Given that the road of an economic forecaster is usually a rocky one, it is\nworth noting that the FOMC's outlook was amazingly prescient. On a year-over-year basis, overall inflation as measured by the personal consumption\nexpenditures, or PCE, price index was a mere 0.3 percent by the end of 2015. The inflation rate did not consistently reach the neighborhood of 2 percent\nuntil this year.\nBy June 2017, the FOMC had moved its target range for the federal funds rate up by a full percentage point. The unemployment rate had fallen to 4.3\npercent, far surpassing expectations. The inflation outlook had progressed roughly as anticipated. So the Committee decided to take the next step in the\nnormalization process by announcing that it would slowly shrink the size of the Fed's balance sheet, which had more than quadrupled in the wake of the\ncrisis.\nThe balance sheet normalization strategy was formulated under two guiding principles. The first was to implement the wind-down in a manner that would\nnot disrupt financial markets. The second was to put the balance-sheet rundown in the background, if you will, focusing ongoing policy adjustments via\nthe traditional interest rate channel. For these reasons, the Committee chose a process that was phased in, gradual, and based on a relatively fixed\nschedule. By most accounts, mine included, this strategy has been successful.\nWhich brings us to today. As I have noted, inflation is effectively at the FOMC's longer-run 2 percent objective. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7\npercent, a level that has not been sustained for at least a half-century. So we are very close to the FOMC's other key goal—promoting maximum\n\n\fsustainable employment growth. Possibly, we have gone some measure beyond.\nThis is a record of great progress, and I believe that it is at least in part a result of the FOMC's deliberate, but patient, removal of monetary\naccommodation. In my view, conditions warrant the final steps in removing any remaining accommodation and adopting a neutral stance of monetary\npolicy. The question now is as complicated as it is straightforward: What, if any, further adjustments are necessary to get to neutral?\nA balance of risks\nIn a recent speech, Fed Chairman Jay Powell emphasized the role that risk management plays in the FOMC's decision-making. He explained how an\nimportant element of good policy is calibrating it to manage both upside and downside risk.\nI couldn't agree more. As I noted in a speech I delivered last month in Baton Rouge, Louisiana: with the economy performing well and monetary policy\nseemingly within shouting distance of neutral, the FOMC faces both upside and downside risks with its next set of policy adjustments. As I see it, the\nCommittee now must balance the risks of stopping short of full normalization and risking an overheated and unstable economic environment, versus\ngoing too far and short-circuiting an otherwise sustainable expansion.\nI will speak to each of these risks in turn.\nToo timid, too long\nIs there is a risk of being too timid, for too long? Yes, and that risk would start with my earlier observation that the current level of the unemployment rate\nis historically quite low. Not only is the current rate at 3.7 percent but, as reflected in the Summary of Economic Projections published in September, the\nconsensus of FOMC participants is that this level will be maintained for at least the next three years. A sustained unemployment rate of 3.7 percent or\nbelow has been seen only twice in the post-World War II era—and not at all since the late 1960s.\nPerhaps more to the point, the current level of the unemployment rate is below that which the consensus of the Committee views as sustainable in the\nlong run. The central tendency in FOMC participants' latest projections ranges from 4.3 to 4.6 percent.\nNow I'll show what many would consider a disturbing picture. It highlights periods of time when the actual unemployment rate fell below what the U.S.\nCongressional Budget Office now estimates as the so-called natural rate of unemployment. I refer to these episodes as \"high-pressure\" periods.\n\nHere is the punchline. Dating back to 1960, every high-pressure period ended in a recession. And, all but one recession was preceded by a highpressure period.\nThere are many possible interpretations for the leading relationship between high-pressure periods and downturns in the economy. One is that the\nrelationship is entirely spurious. That would be a pretty benign interpretation. I'm not convinced that such a benign interpretation is consistent with good\nrisk management practice.\nI think a risk management approach requires that we at least consider the possibility that unemployment rates that are lower than normal for an extended\nperiod are symptoms of an overheated economy.\nOne possible consequence of overheating is that decision-making in the private sector becomes increasingly risky, and imbalances, especially in\nfinancial markets, build up. As of yet, there does not appear to be evidence of widespread imbalances in the United States.\nBut I am not taking the current situation for granted. As an example, I have my eye on some recent evidence in the consumer credit market that I think\nbears watching. We have seen rising delinquencies on consumer credit cards at small banks. While they are not currently driving the core of the market,\nrising delinquencies that manifest in the small bank sector may spill out and become a broader issue. So while the aggregate picture is still a healthy\none, these pockets of concern call for a more careful scrutiny of risks.\nAnother consequence of overheating is that inflationary pressures inevitably build up, leading the central bank, in turn, to respond aggressively, and\neconomic weakness follows.\n\n\fYou might argue that the simple answer is to not respond so aggressively to building signs of inflation, but that would entail risks that few responsible\ncentral bankers would accept.\nIt is true that the Fed and most other advanced-economy central banks have the luxury of solid credibility for achieving and maintaining their price\nstability goals. But we shouldn't forget that such credibility was hard won.\nInflation expectations are stable for now, but we know little about how far the scales can tip before it is no longer so. With apologies to Joni Mitchell,\nwhen it comes to inflation expectations, \"you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone.\" I don't think it would be a good idea to find out.\nRisks of going too fast\nBut just as there are risks to too-timid policy adjustments, there are decidedly risks to policy adjustments that are too aggressive.\nThe main uncertainty, as I see it, is that it is very difficult to determine when the economy is actually overheating—especially when inflationary signals\nacross the board remain subdued.\nConsider, for example, the task of determining the \"normal\" rate of unemployment. My definition of normal is a sustainable level that avoids overheating\nin the economy. I would have pegged an unemployment rate around 5 percent as normal when the Committee started down the path of normalization in\n2015. My view now is that the longer-run \"normal\" rate of unemployment is a good deal closer to 4 percent than 5 percent.\nEstimating the capacity of the economy—about which the unemployment rate is just one measure—is extremely difficult, not least because it can be a\nmoving target. One example is the behavior of the U.S. labor force participation rate.\nMost economists accept that the secular trend of the participation rate is negative, due to the aging of the population. But the overall rate ticked up in the\nlatest report, and has been basically flat for the past several years.\nThe labor force participation rate of prime-age U.S. workers, especially women, has actually been on the rise. We have no solid interpretation for this\ntrend. But it is reasonable to suspect that larger flows of workers into the labor market, smaller flows of unemployed workers out of the labor market, and\nstill relatively modest wage pressures are signs that there may be more slack in labor markets than typically assumed.\nI found another example that capacity may be more flexible than we might think in a recent report from my staff. The Atlanta Fed collects anecdotal\ninformation from businesses throughout our district. These field reports—collected as part of what we call the Regional Economic Information Network,\nor REIN—have for some time included reports of acute shortages in the trucking industry.\nIn the most recent reports, we heard some interesting news. The recent implementation of technologies that monitor and help to enforce restrictions on\nhow long truck drivers can be on the clock has leveled the playing field in the industry. The competitive pressures have resulted in trucking companies\nurging their customers to adopt processes that have resulted in less downtime as drivers wait for their cargo to be unloaded. The faster turnaround time\nhas actually increased capacity in the industry—a result of greater efficiency rather than a greater number of trucks or truck drivers.\nI don't know if this sort of development is a game changer. But it was notable to me that this anecdote came from one of the sectors that has persistently\ncited capacity strains. It was notable at least as a reminder that capacity is always a slippery concept.\nIn addition to the hazards of defining a concept like overheating, there are some rather straightforward downside macroeconomic risks. At least some of\nthe strength in GDP growth this year can be traced to fiscal stimulus. I expect this effect to fade over the next several years. Although fiscal stimulus has\nclearly boosted growth in the present, I don't think we have a firm grasp on whether it is masking any building weakness for the longer run.\nAdd to these potential risks the uncertain outcome of global tariff and trade developments. In general, global growth seems to be slowing. Although the\nUnited States could have safely ignored these developments in the past, assuming that this is true today seems like a recipe for a policy mistake.\nConclusion\nHow, then, to manage the balance between the risks of being too timid and being too aggressive in the Fed's monetary policy course? I can think of no\nsuperior approach than to proceed cautiously and keep a keen eye on the data.\nI don't think we are too far from a neutral policy, and neutral is where we want to be. We may not be there quite yet, but I am inclined to think that a\ntentative approach as we proceed would be appropriate.\nBut I am also prepared to support a more aggressive approach than my baseline view should the data deliver clearer signals of overheating. We are, for\nexample, finally seeing some movement on wage growth. In and of itself, this is a good thing. But accelerating wage pressures would be of concern if\ncoupled with other signs of building inflationary pressures.\nI don't think I am relaying to you anything other than common sense. But what is good risk management, after all, if not the application of common\nsense?\nThanks for your attention. I look forward to our moderated session.\n\nContact: Marc Fordham 404-498-7324\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nPDF version • Raphael Bostic's biography • Speakers Bureau\n\nRELATED LINKS ON OTHER SITES:\n\nWatch the video\n\n\f"

If estimates hold, growth of gross domestic product for the year will have topped\n3 percent for the first time since 2005.\n• Bostic believes that partly due to the trajectory of capital expenditures, real GDP growth will slow over the next few years as the effects of tax\nreform and fiscal stimulus begin to wane.\n• Bostic notes that most respondents to an Atlanta Fed survey measuring firms' year-ahead expectations and uncertainties said tax reform will not\naffect their capital expenditures at all. The survey also found that, despite uncertainty regarding tariffs and changes in trade policy, most firms are\nstill generally quite optimistic about their outlook over the year ahead.\n• He believes that given the current strong growth, very low unemployment rates, and inflation close to 2 percent, monetary policy ought to be\ntaking a more neutral position.\n• Bostic: \"We're within shouting distance of neutral.\" He does not see clear signs of overheating nor of a material weakening in the macroeconomic\ndata. Should the data deliver clearer signs of either, he would be fully prepared to support policy actions to mitigate the risks in either direction.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for that kind introduction. It's a pleasure to be here today.\nWe are less than two weeks away from the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (or FOMC). I won't\npredict the outcome—I'll leave that to you. Between now and the meeting, I will continue to process the incoming data to inform\nmy assessment of the health and momentum of the economy and balance the risks to the outlook.\nToday, I will offer a few thoughts on how I see the current position of the economy, the national economic outlook, and some\nparticulars on the labor market, inflation, and risk management as I consider the monetary policy path.\nAs always, these will be my personal views and may not reflect those of my colleagues here or other colleagues on the FOMC\nor in the Federal Reserve System.\nCurrent economic conditions\nThere is a lot to like about the current snapshot of the U.S. economy. Output has continued to grow at an above-trend clip, the unemployment rate is very\nlow on a historical basis, and inflation has held near the FOMC's 2 percent target recently.\nReal, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) has been on something of a tear recently. Over the first three quarters of 2018, real GDP has\nincreased by 3.3 percent. And according to GDPNow, the Atlanta Fed's in-house tracking model, GDP is expected to increase by a little more than 2 1/2\npercent in the fourth quarter.\nTo be sure, this early in the fourth quarter, there is a lot of uncertainty about the estimate. But if it holds, growth for the year will have topped 3 percent for\nthe first time since 2005. And it will have come in about a half-percentage point higher than I expected even just six months ago.\nAlongside the robust pace of economic growth we have enjoyed this year, job gains have averaged roughly 200,000 a month and the unemployment rate\nhas fallen to 3.7 percent, a level that has not been sustained for at least a half-century.\nWe will, of course, get an important update on labor market conditions in tomorrow's labor report. I think we are very close to meeting the first half of the\nFOMC's dual mandate—promoting maximum sustainable employment growth. And it's possible that we have gone some measure beyond. I will say a bit\nmore on this later.\nThe other half of the FOMC's mandate is to deliver price stability, which has been defined as 2 percent inflation over the longer run. As of October, the\nyear-over-year percent change in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index was at 2 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, the\ncore PCE price index was just a notch below that on a year-over-year basis. Transparency requires that I note that its performance over the past three\nmonths has been modestly weaker. Still, if you paint with a broad enough brush, inflation is either at or very close to our target.\nIt's possible that some of the unexpectedly strong growth we've seen this year can be tied to a more robust response by households to income tax cuts\nalong with a faster ramp-up in federal spending than I anticipated.\n\n\fConsumer spending has accelerated this year, and especially over the past two quarters. Interestingly, the acceleration seems to be concentrated in two\narguably discretionary spending categories—apparel and food services. In fact, the pickup in household spending at restaurants has led to its highest\ntwo-quarter growth rate since the early 1990s, more than tripling its typical contribution to overall output growth.\nGoing forward, my baseline view is that consumer spending will revert to a less torrid but still solid pace. I hold this view, in part, because the latest\nmonthly data on apparel and food services have softened. This may also suggest that some of the impacts from tax reform on household spending\ngrowth are waning.\nThe pace of federal government spending has also quickened over the second half of the year, turning from a headwind to a tailwind for growth, and is\nnow adding about a fourth of a percentage point to growth, on average, over the past four quarters.\nPerhaps surprisingly, business investment has remained relatively tepid. Nonresidential fixed investment has slowed in each of the first three quarters of\n2018. After factoring in a small rebound we expect to see in the fourth quarter, the year-over-year growth rate in business fixed investment will likely still\nbe slightly below its average growth rate during the past two expansions.\nEconomic outlook\nNow to my outlook. Like many other forecasters, I see real GDP growth slowing over the next few years as the effects of tax reform and fiscal stimulus\nbegin to wane. By the end of 2020, my projection has real GDP keeping pace with the underlying potential growth rate of the economy, which I estimate\nto be modestly below 2 percent.\nOne reason I'm a bit skeptical that the current pace of growth can be sustained into the next year is the trajectory of capital expenditures. That view is\nprimarily informed by two unique research initiatives undertaken by my bank's research department.\nThe first is an extensive network of business contacts, community groups, and nonprofit organizations that we affectionately call REIN—or the Regional\nEconomic Information Network. Insights from this REIN network help me paint a broader picture of the health of the economy than I could capture with\neconomic models alone.\nThe other initiative is an exciting new national survey of firms. In partnership with Steven Davis of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nand Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University, the Atlanta Fed has created the Survey of Business Uncertainty (or SBU). This innovative panel survey\nmeasures the one-year-ahead expectations and uncertainties that firms have about their own costs, employment, capital investment, and sales. The\nsample covers a broad range of firm sizes and all regions of the U.S. economy, and every industry sector except agriculture and government.\nLast November, after the original House bill on tax reform had passed, the SBU had a survey in the field asking firms how tax reform would affect their\ncapital expenditure plans for 2018. Roughly two-thirds of respondents said the reform wouldn't affect their capital expenditures at all. Just 15 percent said\nthey would increase capital spending by 10 percent or more, and those responses came mostly from smaller firms.\nThese results held in a follow-up survey in February. The survey asked the same question on capital expenditures for 2018 and extended it to include\nplans for 2019 as well. The results were not meaningfully different than before for 2018. Roughly three-quarters of firms did not plan to change their\ncapital expenditure plans in 2019 as a result of the tax reform.\nAnd, arguably, this has been borne out in the middling trajectory for business investment we have seen so far.\n\nNow, before you think I'm keeping these great insights from the Survey of Business Uncertainty to myself, I'll invite you to visit our website. Last\nWednesday, the Atlanta Fed began publishing some of these data. The hope is that policymakers and researchers can use the SBU to help forecast\neconomic activity and better understand how business expectations and uncertainty affect economic outcomes.\nI see both upside and downside risks to my growth projection. On the upside, businesses may interpret the recent strength of consumer spending as a\nsignal of stronger future demand and may ramp up expansionary capital investment to meet it.\nOn the other hand, the U.S. economy has been beset by increasing uncertainties that may slow its growth, such as international trade tensions, the\npotential slowing of the global economy, and a recent bout of financial volatility. Indeed, our SBU survey data suggest that business uncertainty has\nincreased since the beginning of the year.\nTo be clear, while uncertainty regarding tariffs and changes in trade policy remains a feature of the economic backdrop, most firms appear to have taken\n\n\fthis in stride. According to our survey data, businesses are still generally quite optimistic about their outlook over the year ahead.\nThoughts on the policy path\nGiven the current constellation of strong growth, very low unemployment rates, and inflation close to 2 percent, I think that monetary policy ought to be\ntaking a more neutral position—one that neither provides policy accommodation nor hinders growth.\nWhile that sounds easy enough, this neutral rate is not something we observe directly, and as such, we can only infer its position. So in attempting to\nachieve a neutral stance of policy, I have adopted a risk management approach, attempting to balance both the upside and downside risks to a further\nremoval of accommodation.\nThose risks are, one, staying too accommodative on rates and risking an overheated and unstable economic and financial environment. And, two,\npushing rates up too far, too fast and potentially short-circuiting an otherwise sustainable expansion. And it just so happens I have a picture that helps\nhighlight those risks.\n\nThis slide shows periods of time when the actual unemployment rate fell below what the U.S. Congressional Budget Office now estimates as the socalled natural rate of unemployment. I refer to these episodes as \"high-pressure\" periods.\nHere is the punchline. Dating back to 1960, every high-pressure period ended in a recession. And all but one recession was preceded by a highpressure period.\nThere are many possible interpretations for the leading relationship between high-pressure periods and economic downturns. One is that the relationship\nis entirely spurious. But I'm not convinced that such a benign interpretation is consistent with good risk management practice.\nI think a risk management approach requires that we at least consider the possibility that unemployment rates that are lower than normal for an extended\nperiod are symptoms of an overheated economy.\nOne potential consequence of overheating is that inflationary pressures inevitably build up, leading the central bank to take a much more \"muscular\"\nstance of policy at the end of these high-pressure periods to combat rising nominal pressures. Economic weakness follows.\nYou might argue that the simple answer is to not respond so aggressively to building signs of inflation, but that would entail risks that few responsible\ncentral bankers would accept.\nIt is true that the Fed and most other advanced-economy central banks have the luxury of solid credibility for achieving and maintaining their price\nstability goals. But we shouldn't forget that such credibility was hard won.\nInflation expectations are reasonably stable for now, but we know little about how far the scales can tip before it is no longer so.\nOn the other hand, there are decided risks to raising rates too soon and too aggressively.\nThe crux of the issue, as I see it, is that it is very difficult in real time to determine when the economy is actually overheating. That is especially true at the\nmoment, when the signaling from the nominal side of the economy is, if anything, still a bit subdued.\nWhile nominal wage growth has picked up since the beginning of the year, it is still trending in line with productivity growth and inflation. Inflation itself\nhas, if anything, softened slightly over the past three months.\nI know that on this picture the \"normal\" or natural rate of unemployment is drawn with a sharp black line, but in reality it's best to think about that line as\nmore of a blurred zone or range. My definition of normal is a sustainable level that avoids overheating the economy. I would have pegged an\n\n\funemployment rate around 5 percent as normal when the Committee started down the path of normalization in 2015. Fast forward to September of this\nyear, and the Committee's longer-run consensus projection for the unemployment rate had fallen by almost half a percentage point, to 4.5 percent. And,\nI'm on record suggesting it may even be lower than that. So the red zone could be smaller than what you see here.\nEstimating the capacity of the economy—of which the unemployment rate is just one measure—is extremely difficult, not least because it can be a\nmoving target. One example is the behavior of the U.S. labor force participation rate.\nThe labor force participation rate of prime-age U.S. workers, especially women, has actually been rising. We have no solid explanation for this trend. But\nit is reasonable to suspect that larger flows of workers into the labor market, smaller flows of unemployed workers out of the labor market, and still\nrelatively modest wage pressures are signs that there may be more slack in labor markets than implied if we just focused on the unemployment rate.\nSome might argue that this is further evidence that we are right at or close to full employment rather than measurably beyond it.\nConclusion\nSo, in an environment where even defining the concept of overheating is a challenge, how can we balance the risks of being too timid with the risk of\nbeing too muscular? For me, the answer is to proceed cautiously, with a keen eye on the data. This will particularly be the case over the next six to 12\nmonths, as I look for signals in the data that might confirm or refute my current position.\nI currently think we're within shouting distance of neutral, and I do think neutral is where we want to be. I'm not seeing clear signs of overheating, nor am\nI seeing any indications of a material weakening in the macroeconomic data at the moment.\nThat said, should the data deliver clearer signals of either, I would be fully prepared to support policy actions to mitigate the risks in either direction.\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Regional Economic Information Network (REIN) • Survey of Business Uncertainty (SBU) •\nRaphael Bostic's biography • Speakers Bureau\n\nContact: Marc Fordham 404-498-7324\n\n\f"

This speech is an update of one Lockhart delivered on January 9, 2017, to the\nRotary Club of Atlanta.\nIt's a pleasure to be back in Huntsville. As I have traveled the Southeast as president of the Atlanta Fed, I've come to realize the uniqueness of\nHuntsville in Alabama and in the region. In many respects, Huntsville is one of a kind. Huntsville has an enviable economic position, and I salute you\nfor that.\nHuntsville and its environs have been well represented over the years in Federal Reserve citizen governance. Pam Hudson, CEO of Crestwood\nMedical Center, is a current director and chair of the board of our Birmingham Branch. Tom Stanton, CEO of Adtran, preceded Pam as chair and\nserved for six years until 2014. Hundley Batts and Bobby Bradley served as directors before Pam and Tom. And Larkin Martin, of Decatur, has done\neverything your central bank could ask of her and more: Birmingham Branch director, Agriculture Advisory Council, chair of the Federal Reserve\nBank of Atlanta, and chair of the conference of all the chairs. She also hired me just before the financial crisis. Thank you, Larkin.\nI also want to introduce Lesley McClure, our regional executive for Alabama working from Birmingham. Lesley's job is to listen to contacts all over\nthe state about how you are experiencing the economy.\nOver the 10 years I've been a Fed policymaker, I seem never to have avoided the Chinese curse \"may you live in interesting times.\" The current juncture is, well, interesting.\nOver the last several weeks, since the election, optimism about our economic prospects has increased. Many in the business community are expecting faster growth\nresulting from fiscal stimulus, infrastructure investment, deregulation, and tax reform. At the same time, anecdotal input from contacts across the Southeast reflects a \"wait\nand see\" posture as regards capital investment for growth.\nIn a few days, I will be stepping down as Atlanta Fed president almost 10 years to the day of my arrival. Today I want to provide some perspective on the current situation by\nlooking back at how we arrived at this particular economic moment. With that as background, I'll offer my views on the near- and medium-term outlook and comment on how\nour national economy is positioned for the future. How the economy is positioned, realistically, for the future is a pivotal question, it seems to me.\nThis is a good time for my usual disclaimer. I'll present only my personal views. I'm not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nLet's go back a decade to the time just after Larkin Martin's fateful decision to hire me. There was plenty of drama early in the decade of my tenure. There was the financial\ncrisis—it's fair to say \"panic\"—in 2007 and 2008. This turbulent period involved bank failures, bailouts, interventions to stabilize markets, government capital forced on banks,\nand understandable political and public outrage.\nIf you prefer pictures to commentary here, in general terms, is what happened to the economy from 2006 to early 2009. Let me mention that even in times of severe\ncontraction, economic data can follow a sawtooth pattern. Over the next few minutes, I'm going to present some graphs where the month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter\nvariability is smoothed out.\nThe curve you see on the screen is an apt depiction of a raft of economic indicators. It's a fair representation of overall economic activity, consumer spending, house prices,\nbank lending, and many other key data. Starting in 2007 and through 2009, virtually all key economic indicators took a dive (or the inverse—rose dramatically when that was\na bad thing).\nThis is where I came on the scene. I know what you're thinking. In my defense, I'll point out—as economists often say—correlation does not equal causation.\nOne account of the last 10 years involves a story of slow, but satisfactory, cyclical recovery. After a deep and damaging recession—officially dated from December 2007 to\nJune 2009—the economy got on a recovery path that has lasted to today. If I add the years since 2009 to the earlier chart, this curve is a good representation of much of the\ncyclical story of the last decade.\n\n\fLet me back that up with some details.\nReal gross domestic product, or total output, now stands at 112 percent of the 2007 level.\nIn a two-year period during the recession, the economy lost more than 8 1/2 million jobs. Over 15 million jobs have been added since the labor market hit bottom,\nroughly 7 million above the level before the crisis.\nThe net worth of U.S. households and nonprofits fell by more than $12 trillion during the recession. Household net worth has rebounded by more than $34 trillion since\nthen and is now approximately a third higher than prior to the crisis.\nA big share of the growth of household wealth came from recovering house prices. After falling nearly 30 percent during the crisis, house prices in the aggregate have\nfully recouped those losses plus a little more.\nPerhaps as a result, measures of consumer confidence are at their highest levels since 2007.\nHave we returned to normal? I feel some need to resist calling this recovery a return to normal. Even though the economy has been through what looks like a full cycle, the\neconomy is \"returning,\" if you will, to a new place. I think of \"normal\" as a code word for a desired state of the economy—in equilibrium, at full employment, with inflation\nrunning at an annual rate of 2 percent, and all this sustainable. That's what \"normal\" means to me.\nAs I said, this cyclical recovery is a satisfactory story, but it is a subplot, not the whole story. A more complete story of the economy includes three other subplots.\nThere's a policy subplot. The policy response to the financial crisis and ensuing recession was extraordinary.\nThe Fed's policy interest rate—the rate that highly influences all other interest rates—went from 5 1/4 percent on the day I started in March 2007 to zero, in effect, by\nDecember 2008. The policy rate stayed there for seven years. Today—after only two quarter-point increases over the past 14 months—the policy rate target range rests at\n1/2 to 3/4 percent.\nWhen interest rate policy goes as low as it can go and central bankers want to add stimulus to a sluggish economy, they sometimes resort to unconventional measures. One\naspect of the Fed's unconventional policy was a controversial measure known as QE, or quantitative easing, in central bank jargon. The Fed created new money and bought\nlong-maturity Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, and did this three times. The aim was to put downward pressure on long-term market interest rates to make\nmortgages, car loans, business term loans, and bond financing cheaper. As a consequence of these policy actions, the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve grew from $900\nbillion before the crisis to around $4.5 trillion today, a quintupling.\nThere is a secular trends subplot. It underlaid the cyclical behavior of the economy and the policy reaction that accompanied it. Secular trends are aspects of the economy\nthat did not behave cyclically. Many predated the financial crisis and recession. Some of these may reflect ongoing structural changes in an evolving economy and society.\nThe distinction between secular trends and structural factors in economics is not always crystal clear. Secular trends may amount to deep-seated structural problems. Or\nthey may not. They may be reversible. Or they may be irreversible. I'll simply say such trends tend to move persistently in one direction for a long while, sometimes in an\nunhelpful or undesirable direction.\nThe point I want to make is while we enjoyed a cyclical recovery, there were secular factors holding back expansion. To illustrate the secular versus the cyclical, I'll show\nsome of these persistent secular trends side-by-side with associated cyclical factors. I do this to make the point that, while the economy has recovered in many respects, it\nhas also evolved to a different place today. This is the point I made earlier when talking about what \"normal\" means. And again, I've smoothed the data fluctuations to present\na simple trajectory for each trend.\nI'll start with employment. Employment has substantially recovered. I think we're close to a state of full employment. Here's the employment cycle in terms of unemployment.\nGoing back to the previous slide, while we've seen employment recover, we've also seen a secular decline in labor force participation.\nEmployment-related secular trends are highly influenced by demographic trends. It's well known that the United States has an aging population distribution. The baby boom\ngeneration is reaching retirement age, and the number of retirees is growing. Age demographics, and demographic trends broadly, affect the economy in a number of ways.\nI'll cite just a few: consumption patterns including health care consumption; wealth distribution, savings levels, and investment patterns; and workforce growth, composition,\nand labor market dynamism. The concept of labor market dynamism captures worker geographic mobility, job creation and destruction, and worker churn. It, too, has been in\nsecular decline.\nThere's one more point related to employment: while employment has returned, wage growth fell and then stagnated for much of the decade until recently. This slide\nhighlights this stagnant period. In addition, as is well known, income and wealth inequality have increased.\nTo widen the lens, the employment recovery can be attributed to the resumption of growth of gross domestic product, or GDP. Think of GDP as total output or total economic\nactivity. GDP growth has averaged a little over 2 percent since the recession officially ended in the summer of 2009. The recovery has been slow compared to earlier postrecession episodes. That said, as mentioned earlier, GDP has regained all the ground lost during the recession and more.\nHowever, for much of the recovery period, productivity growth has languished. Growth of productivity is a key driver of overall economic growth. And it is a basis of wage\ngrowth. It has been extremely weak by historical standards, and the reasons are a matter of debate.\nAlso, while the economy overall has recovered, business investment spending has been weak through most of the recovery period to date. To generalize, the private sector\nhas been spending to maintain and replace capital equipment and software, but not to build capacity for a rosier future. Businesses have spent to take costs out, but not to\nprepare for increased demand. I think this is one of the reasons for weak productivity growth.\nAlong with weak capital spending, business dynamism has been in secular decline starting before the recession and throughout the decade. A good indicator of business\ndynamism is new business formation.\nI'll provide one more example contrasting the cyclical and the secular. The housing sector has made a nice comeback—as indicated by housing starts, house prices,\nmultifamily residential development, and sales activity. At the same time, household formation seems to be in secular decline. The right-hand side is a picture of your grown\nkid living in your basement. I'm told the number of grown children living with parents is at the highest level since the 1940s.\n\n\fMy final subplot is about headwinds. Headwinds, by my definition, are temporary developments that suppress economic activity. The spate of such episodes over recent\nyears may partially explain the weakness in business capital investment. What headwinds do I have in mind? I'm referring to events and developments such as fiscal crises\n(government shutdowns, the fiscal cliff), uncertain effects of the Affordable Care Act, the Greek debt saga, European fiscal strains and European bank weakness, the\nslowdown in China, oil price volatility and decline, and last year, Brexit and the U.S. presidential election. Each of these, in its time, contributed to uncertainty and raised\nconcerns about what the future held. These kinds of concerns evoked caution and influenced decisions to defer investment, hiring, and major household purchases. The\nheightened uncertainty shortened planning horizons and rattled financial markets.\nThe economic story of the past decade, with its four subplots (cyclical recovery, policy response to crisis and recession, secular trends, temporary headwinds) is prologue to\nwhat we all care most about—our economic future.\nI'll offer views on that future in a just a moment, but let me add still more context to the economic moment. The experience of the past decade has brought growing\nrecognition of fundamental factors weighing on the economy. As a result, many economic analysts have lowered certain of their medium- and longer-term expectations.\nRecently, many Fed economists—among them, my team at the Atlanta Fed—have progressively lowered estimates of three critical forecast elements. First, we have dropped\nour estimate of long-run potential GDP growth to reflect both demographic effects on the labor supply and a slower pace of productivity growth. Second, we have reduced our\nforecasts of actual GDP growth in the nearer term, reflecting the negative impact of the slow business-investment recovery I referenced earlier.\nThe third critical adjustment to our projections relates to where we think interest rates will settle out in a cycle of rising rates—where the Fed would stop, in effect. You might\nhave heard the terms \"neutral rate\" or \"equilibrium rate.\" This is the policy rate setting where monetary policy can be judged to be neither accommodative nor restrictive,\nneither purposely applying stimulus nor tightening. Such a policy setting would fit an economy humming along at steady state—an economy operating at full employment and\nregistering an inflation rate around 2 percent. Normal—in my sense of the word.\nBased on our changing assessment of potential growth, we have lowered our estimate of the neutral rate, and along with it, the projected path to this stopping point. Knowing\nwhat I know today, I continue to expect a gradual pace of interest rate increases with a stopping point at a lower policy rate setting than in earlier rising rate cycles.\nYou may be asking, \"So what?\" I'll answer this way. When I joined the Fed in March 2007, the official unemployment rate was 4 1/2 percent. The inflation rate was running\nabout 2 1/2 percent. And, as mentioned earlier, the Fed's policy interest rate was set at 5 1/4 percent.\nToday, conditions are very similar—almost the same. Yet the target range of the Fed's policy rate is set at 1/2 to 3/4 percent. How can this stark difference in policy be\nexplained?\nThere was one answer to this question in the earlier cyclical-secular, side-by-side graphs—the weight of secular trends on the economy. While the economy has enjoyed\ncyclical recovery, certain underlying fundamental forces have been restraining the pace of growth. Most prominent among these are productivity, business investment, and\nlabor force trends.\nAs we start 2017, the economy appears solid, growing steadily at a moderate pace—to put a round number on this moderate pace of growth, around 2 percent. I expect\ninflation, which is still below the Fed's 2 percent longer-run target, to edge higher. I see inflation getting to a rate near the FOMC's target this year or next. I expect\nemployment to reach or even exceed most estimates of full employment. That's my baseline outlook.\nWhile I think we can expect a continuation of the moderate growth enjoyed over the recovery, I'm agnostic at this point in time about achieving a sustained pace of growth\nmuch above a range of 2 to 2 1/2 percent. While I believe the economy is well positioned for moderate growth and steadily improving conditions, it's less certain that the\neconomy is positioned for a breakout to markedly higher growth that will last. Accomplishing such a breakout requires offsetting demographic influences and accelerating\nproductivity growth. These are heavy lifts.\nI mentioned demographic influences earlier. Demographic trends are strong forces. We see demographic trends expressed especially in labor force participation.\nFor the next several years, the big labor force story will be the growth of retired workers over age 65. This story swamps the growth of prime-age workers age 25 to 54. In\nalmost all plausible scenarios, participation will decline over the coming years. Even if the decline of participation stabilizes, labor supply growth will continue to slow because\nof the aging population. This puts the burden on productivity growth to achieve higher GDP growth rates.\nTo boost productivity growth, we need a number of things on the supply side of the economy to come together, among them more business investment. The chances of a\nsustained productivity surge are an unknown.\nThe job of cyclical recovery is largely done. The Federal Reserve is quite close to achieving its mandated policy objectives of full employment and stable prices. The job of\noffsetting secular trends and implementing structural change lies ahead. This set of challenges will define the next economic phase.\nDuring the Great Recession and the recovery phase, the Fed and monetary policy largely took the lead. Monetary policy will continue to be influential, but success in the next\nphase of economic advances depends greatly on the actions of the administration, Congress, and the private sector.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version with slides • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speakers Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nCrisis, Recession, and Recovery: 2007-16\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRotary Club of Atlanta\nLoudermilk Center\nAtlanta, Georgia\nJanuary 9, 2017\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a January 9 speech at the Rotary Club of Atlanta, looks at the economic story of the past decade.\nLockhart says the complete narrative of the last 10 years involves a story of slow, but satisfactory, cyclical recovery.\nLockhart states that some underlying fundamentals, including productivity, business investment, and labor force trends, have been restraining the pace of growth.\nLockhart notes that many close observers of the economy have lowered medium- and longer-term expectations for long-run potential GDP growth, actual GDP growth in\nthe nearer term, and the neutral policy rate setting.\nLockhart continues to expect a gradual pace of interest rate increases.\nLockhart believes the economy today is well positioned for moderate growth and steadily improving conditions.\n\nThis is my 10th and final appearance at our Rotary Club in my capacity as president of the Atlanta Fed. I am stepping down effective February 28,\n10 years to the day of my arrival. These last 10 years have been an extraordinary period economically for all Americans and certainly for me as a\nFederal Reserve Bank president.\nToday I will observe tradition and offer my views on the outlook for 2017 and a bit beyond, but I would like to preface my look ahead with a look back\nat the economic story of the last decade. This retrospective will coincide almost exactly with my time in office as a Fed policymaker. I'll present only\nmy personal reflections and views. I'm not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nI promise this won't be just a trip down memory lane. I'll look back at the events and forces that have shaped our collective economic experience, but also push the narrative\ninto the present. The relevant question, I think, is, how is our national economy positioned for the future?\nThe storyline has plenty of drama early in the decade of my tenure. There was the financial crisis—it's fair to say \"panic\"—in 2007 and 2008. This scary period involved bank\nfailures, bailouts, interventions to stabilize markets, government capital forced on banks, and political and public outrage.\nStarting in 2007 and through 2009, virtually all key economic indicators took a dive (or the inverse—rose dramatically when that was a bad thing). I came on the scene just\nbefore the crisis hit. I know what you're thinking. In my defense, I'll point out—as economists often say—correlation does not equal causation.\nThe complete narrative of the last 10 years involves a story of slow, but satisfactory, cyclical recovery. After a deep and damaging recession—officially dated from December\n2007 to June 2009—the economy got on a recovery path that has lasted to today. Let me back that up with some details.\nReal gross domestic product, or total output, now stands at 111 percent of the 2007 level.\nIn a two-year period during the recession, the economy lost more than eight-and-a-half million jobs. Over 15 million jobs have been added since the labor market hit\nbottom, almost seven million above the level before the crisis.\nThe net worth of U.S. households and nonprofits fell by more than $12 trillion during the recession. Household net worth has rebounded by more than $34 trillion since\nthen and is now approximately a third higher than prior to the crisis.\nA big share of the growth of household wealth came from recovering house prices. After falling 27 percent during the crisis, house prices in the aggregate have fully\nrecouped those losses plus a little more.\nPerhaps as a result, measures of consumer confidence are at their highest levels since 2007.\nHave we returned to normal? I feel some need to resist calling this recovery a return to normal. Even though the economy has been through what looks like a full cycle, the\neconomy is \"returning\" to a new place. In that sense, there is no return to normal. I think of \"normal\" as code for a desired state of the economy—in equilibrium, at full\nemployment, with annual inflation running at 2 percent, and all this sustainable. That's what \"normal\" means to me.\nFour subplots\nAs I said, this cyclical recovery is a satisfactory story, but it is a subplot, not the whole story. The deeper story of the economy includes three other subplots.\nThere's a policy subplot. The policy response to the financial crisis and ensuing recession was unconventional. The Fed's policy interest rate—the rate that highly influences\nall other interest rates—went from 5 1/4 percent on the day I started in March 2007 to zero, in effect, by December 2008. The policy rate stayed there for eight years. Today—\nafter only two quarter-point increases over the past 13 months—the policy rate rests at 3/4 percent or a little lower.\nWhen interest rate policy goes as low as it can go, central banks sometimes resort to unconventional measures to add stimulus to an ailing economy. One aspect of\nunconventional policy was a controversial measure known as QE, or quantitative easing, in central bank jargon. The Fed created new money and bought long-maturity\nTreasury and mortgage-backed securities, and did this three times. The aim was to put downward pressure on long-term market interest rates to make mortgages, car loans,\nbusiness term loans, and bond financing cheaper. As a consequence of these policy actions, the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve grew from $900 billion before the\ncrisis to around $4.5 trillion today, a quintupling.\n\n\fThere is a secular trend subplot. It underlaid the cyclical behavior of the economy and the policy reaction that accompanied it. Secular trends are important economic\ndimensions that did not swing back cyclically. Many predated the 10-year period of my story. Some of these may reflect ongoing structural changes in our society and\neconomy.\nThe distinction between secular and structural trends in economics is not always crystal clear. Secular trends may amount to deep-seated structural problems. Or they may\nnot. They may be reversible. Or they may be irreversible. I'll simply say such trends tend to move persistently in one direction for a long while, sometimes in an unhelpful or\nundesirable direction.\nTo illustrate, I'd like to contrast certain secular trends that had the effect of offsetting, to an extent, economic indicators that carved cyclical trajectories. I do this to make the\npoint that, while the economy has recovered in many respects, it has also evolved to a different place today. This is the point I made earlier when talking about what \"normal\"\nmeans.\nI'll start with employment. Employment has recovered substantially. I think we're close to a state of full employment. At the same time, we've seen a secular decline in labor\nforce participation.\nEmployment-related secular trends are highly affected by demographics. It's well known that the United States has an aging population distribution. The baby boom\ngeneration is reaching retirement age, and the number of retirees is growing. Age demographics, and demographic trends broadly, affect the economy in a number of ways.\nI'll cite just a few: consumption patterns including health care consumption; wealth distribution, savings levels, and investment patterns; and workforce growth, composition,\nand labor market dynamism. The concept of labor market dynamism captures worker geographic mobility, job creation and destruction, and worker churn. While employment\nhas recovered, labor market dynamism has been declining for some time.\nAlso, while employment has returned, wage growth fell and then stagnated for much of the decade until recently. In addition, income and wealth inequality have increased.\nThe employment recovery can be attributed to the resumption of growth of gross domestic product, or GDP. Think of GDP as total output or total economic activity. GDP\ngrowth has averaged just over 2 percent since the recession officially ended in the summer of 2009. The recovery has been slow compared to earlier post-recession\nepisodes. Yet, GDP has regained all the ground lost during the recession and more.\nHowever, for much of the recovery period, productivity growth has languished. Growth of productivity is a key driver of overall economic growth. And, it is a basis of wage\ngrowth. Productivity growth has been extremely weak, and the reasons are a matter of debate.\nAlso, while the economy overall has recovered, business investment spending has been weak through most of the recovery period to date. To generalize, the private sector\nhas been spending to maintain and replace capital equipment and software, but not to build capacity for a rosier future. Business leaders have not been ready to place those\nkinds of bets. I think this is one of the reasons for weak productivity growth.\nAlong with weak capital spending, business dynamism has been in secular decline starting before the recession and throughout the decade. A good indicator of business\ndynamism is new business formation.\nI'll provide one more example that contrasts the cyclical and the secular. The housing sector has made a nice comeback—as indicated by housing starts, house prices,\nmultifamily residential development, and sales activity. At the same time, household formation seems to be in secular decline. This is about your grown kid living in your\nbasement. I'm told that the number of grown children living with parents is at the highest level since the 1940s.\nMy final subplot is about headwinds. Headwinds, by my definition, are temporary developments that suppress activity. Such episodes may partially explain the weakness in\nbusiness capital investment. What headwinds do I have in mind? I'm referring to events and developments such as fiscal crises (government shutdowns, the fiscal cliff),\nuncertain effects of the Affordable Care Act, the Greek debt saga, European fiscal strains and bank weakness, the slowdown in China, oil price volatility and decline, and\nrecently, Brexit and the U.S. presidential election. Each of these, in its time, raised concerns about what the future held and evoked caution. These kinds of concerns\ninfluenced decisions to defer investment, hiring, and major household purchases. They shortened planning horizons and rattled financial markets.\nCurrent position of the economy\nThe economic story of the past decade—with its four subplots of cyclical recovery, the path of policy, secular trends, and temporary headwinds—is prologue to what we all\ntoday care most about—our economic future.\nI'll offer my views on the outlook in a moment, but let me first add some context. The experience of the past decade—with growing recognition of fundamental factors\nweighing on the economy—has caused many close observers of the economy to lower medium- and longer-term expectations. Over the last two or three years, many Fed\neconomists—among them, my team at the Atlanta Fed—have progressively lowered estimates of three critical forecast elements. First, we have dropped our estimate of\nlong-run potential GDP growth to reflect both demographic effects on the labor supply and a slower pace of structural productivity growth. Second, we have reduced our\nforecasts of actual GDP growth in the nearer term, reflecting the negative impact of the slow business-investment recovery I referenced earlier.\nThe third critical adjustment to our projections is a little arcane, but very important as a working assumption or estimate. It relates to where we think interest rates will settle\nout in a cycle of rising rates. It's where the Fed would stop. You may have heard the terms \"neutral rate\" or \"equilibrium rate.\" This is the policy rate setting where monetary\npolicy can be judged to be neither accommodative nor restrictive, neither purposely applying stimulus nor tightening. This policy setting would fit an economy humming along\nat steady state—an economy operating at full employment and registering an inflation rate around 2 percent.\nBased on our changing assessment of potential growth, we have lowered our estimate of the neutral rate, and along with it, the anticipated path to this terminal point.\nKnowing what I know today, I continue to expect a gradual pace of interest rate increases.\nIn general terms, the downward adjustment of these forecast elements is analogous to a lowering of the metabolic rate of the economy. Growth has been subdued, but it's\nbeen good enough to bring unemployment down by half.\nWhen I joined the Fed in March 2007, the official unemployment rate was 4 1/2 percent. The inflation rate was running about 2 1/2 percent. And, as mentioned earlier, the\nFed's policy interest rate was set at 5 1/4 percent.\n\n\fToday, the unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, almost identical to the rate 10 years ago. The equivalent inflation rate is currently running at 1.6 percent. So conditions are\nclose to the same. Yet the target range of the Fed's policy rate is set at 1/2 to 3/4 percent. How can this stark difference in policy be explained?\nOne answer lies in the weight of secular trends on the economy. While the economy has enjoyed cyclical recovery, some underlying fundamentals have been restraining the\npace of growth. Most prominent among them are productivity, business investment, and labor force trends.\nOutlook\nNow to the outlook. The economy going into 2017 appears solid, but growing at a moderate pace. To put a number on this, it's around 2 percent per annum, as mentioned\nearlier. The last half of 2016 will likely register a bit stronger growth, but the year overall will clock growth of near 2 percent, consistent with earlier years.\nMy outlook anticipates more of the same over the next three years. I expect inflation—which is still below the Fed's 2 percent longer-run target—to move higher, converging\non target in 2017 or 2018. I expect employment to reach or even exceed most estimates of full employment.\nMany in the business and financial community are anticipating improved growth prospects with the change of administration in Washington. Again speaking only for myself, I\nhave not factored fiscal stimulus and regulatory change into my growth forecast. Without details, I consider it too early to estimate the effect of these policy changes.\nHow is our economy positioned for the future? This is the key question. The economy today is well positioned for moderate growth and steadily improving conditions. It's less\ncertain that the economy is positioned for a breakout to markedly higher growth on a sustained basis. To accomplish such a breakout—as many anticipate and certainly we\nall hope for—requires offsetting demographic drags and accelerating productivity growth, in my opinion. To boost productivity growth, we need a number of things on the\nsupply side of the economy to come together, among them more business investment.\nThe job of cyclical recovery is largely done. The Federal Reserve is quite close to achieving its mandated policy objectives of full employment and stable prices. The job of\nmitigating secular trends and implementing structural adjustments lies ahead. This set of challenges will define the next phase.\nThis juncture feels transitional to me. During the Great Recession and the recovery phase, the Fed and monetary policy took the lead. Now I think it's time for the Fed and\nmonetary policy to shift to more of a support role.\nThe Fed's monetary policy mostly affects demand conditions. Inducing supply-side and structural change is more the domain of Congress, the administration, and the private\nsector.\nWith the cyclical job largely complete, it's personally tempting to claim that we're at the end of an era—or at least a phase—and that this transition coincides with my leaving\nthe scene. That's going a bit too far. As I said, correlation does not equal causation.\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speakers Bureau\n\n\f"

As you may know, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, met Tuesday and Wednesday. The FOMC is the group in\nthe Federal Reserve responsible for setting monetary policy, especially interest rate policy. The Committee took no action at this week's meeting and\nkept the policy rate where it's been since last December—in a range of 25 to 50 basis points.\nI am going to try to make myself useful to you this morning. In the time I have, I'm going to focus on the factors that I expect will influence how many\nhouses you'll sell in 2017 and coming years.\nLet me provide you a roadmap of my remarks. I will comment on the factors influencing demand. They include the health of the general economy,\ncredit availability, and affordability. I'll then comment on supply factors including inventory levels and residential investment or, more narrowly, new home construction.\nThe punchline will be positive. Despite some challenges, my outlook for the housing sector is, on net, optimistic. I think the longer-run housing outlook looks promising\nbecause of demographic trends and projected household formation. In the near term, the broad economy seems to be on a moderate growth path, which should be good\nnews for your industry.\nBefore I get going, a disclaimer: I'll be offering my personal views. I'm not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the FOMC.\nDemand factors\nI'll start with comments on the general health of, and outlook for, the broad economy. I'll touch on the strength of the economy as a factor propelling housing demand.\nEconomic growth in 2016 will likely be a little below 2 percent. Expansion in the first half of the year was rather weak. The economy grew at an annual rate of 1.1 percent\nthrough June. The first estimate of the Bureau of Economic Analysis of third-quarter growth of GDP (gross domestic product) was nearly 3 percent. I had been expecting a\ngrowth rebound in the second half, so the headline number of 2.9 percent was welcome. I expect the fourth quarter and 2017 to be consistent with a continuing theme of\nmoderate annual growth of around 2 percent.\nThe details of the third-quarter report carried mixed messages, but did not set off any alarm bells. Consumer activity backed off a little in the quarter that ended in September,\nbut on the heels of second-quarter strength. Business fixed investment improved slightly, but remains subdued. Net inventory accumulation contributed to growth after having\nbeen a drag for several preceding quarters.\nResidential investment is, appropriately, of particular interest to you. To generalize, this element of the growth picture has been somewhat soft, but improving. Monthly\nhousing starts have been in the range of 1 million to just over 1.2 million annualized since early last year. Residential investment has historically been a contributor in a\nrecovery, but this time less so.\nEmployment is an important channel through which the overall economy influences housing demand. Employment conditions continue to tighten. The pace of job gains has\nbeen stronger than the pace of economic growth over the last two years.\nThis morning we got the employment report for October. It showed a net gain of 161,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate ticked down a tenth to 4.9 percent. While I haven't\nhad much time to dig into the details, the top-line numbers look solid.\nLabor force participation has been in secular decline for a number of years, partly due to baby-boomer retirements. However, participation has risen a bit over the past year.\nContrary to some reports, the uptick in participation is mostly due to fewer people leaving the workforce versus out-of-the-workforce people coming off the sidelines. This\nrespite from the declining participation trend means the official unemployment rate has gone sideways for several months, but for good reasons.\nWe have been paying attention to wage growth as an indication of a tightening labor market. Wage growth is accelerating modestly. At the Atlanta Fed, we have our own tool\ncalled the Wage Growth Tracker. It tracks wage gains of continuously employed individuals, which means it is not influenced by newer, lower-wage entrants. Readings of our\nWage Growth Tracker have risen to the highest level since the recovery began in 2009.\n\n\fTo summarize, job gains remain on a stable course, and the economy is approaching full employment. Conditions overall are favorable for your industry, in my opinion.\nAs you may know, the FOMC focuses on two specific policy goals—maximum employment and price stability, or low and stable inflation.\nInflation continues to trend below our 2 percent longer-run target. So an immediate policy objective is to get the rate of inflation closer to 2 percent. It's fair to say inflation has\nbeen low and stable, just a bit below what the Committee considers the healthiest ongoing rate.\nA positive economic environment should support house sales, especially if combined with favorable demographics. Millennials are the largest demographic group in the\ncountry, larger than my boomer generation.\nThe circumstances of millennials, as prospective home buyers, are mixed. They are living with their parents or remaining renters longer and starting families later. As recently\nas 2013, a third of 18- to 34-year-olds were living at home, according to research by Zelman and Associates. That is the highest number since 1970. Zelman's research\nconcludes that this phenomenon is not a permanent structural headwind. Their study in 2013 estimated pent-up demand in this age group of more than 1 million households,\nassuming a better economic environment. And much economic progress has been achieved since 2013.\nMany millennials are entering the workforce with considerable student loan debt. So far, student loan debt does not appear to be a material threat to ultimate homeownership.\nMillennials with high student loan debt also tend to have higher incomes and can afford to purchase a home.\nAlthough there may be fewer qualified first-time home buyers than typical at the moment, household formations should average on the order of 1.4 million to 1.5 million a\nyear through 2020. This projection is based on work done at the San Francisco Fed using Census Bureau projections. Household formation should support house sales to\nsome extent. Some of the pickup in household formations will fuel rental markets. The single family/multifamily mix appears to be changing, so a greater proportion could go\nto multifamily. All that said, studies have confirmed the intention of millennials to eventually be homeowners.\nA third factor affecting demand conditions is credit availability. The Mortgage Credit Availability Index produced by the Mortgage Bankers Association suggests that credit\navailability through September has continued to slowly improve.\nThrough the first half of the year, banks reported strengthening demand for most categories of mortgage loans. Results from the August Federal Reserve Board Senior Loan\nOfficer Opinion Survey indicate that some banks have continued to ease lending standards on loans eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A Wall Street\nJournal article this week addressed nonbank lenders' growing share of mortgage finance, especially in segments banks have deemphasized. This should result in wider\ncredit availability.\nCertainly, there are individual buyers who still face challenges qualifying for loans, especially borrowers at the lower end of the creditworthiness scale. But, overall, I think you\ncan argue that credit for home purchases is gradually becoming more available.\nOne more factor influencing sales is affordability. The rise of house prices has been outpacing general inflation as well as growth of income. But as the National Association\nof Realtors' affordability index shows, low mortgage rates have been partially offsetting this unfavorable affordability drift.\nI'm sure you are concerned about the future interest rate environment and its effect on affordability in individual cases. I anticipate a very gradually rising interest rate\nenvironment over the next two years. At the same time, I do not see rates marching higher for an extended period in a preprogrammed tightening campaign. The economy\ndoes not call for that, at least not at this time. Rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and, therefore, meeting-to-meeting, in my view.\nAnd when the rate environment does reach steady state, mortgage rates should still be low and affordable by historical standards. Over our last few official projections, we\npolicymakers have revised lower our estimates of the so-called neutral policy rate. Think of the neutral rate as where we stop when policy goals have been substantially met\nand the economy is functioning well on a sustainable trend.\nIn my opinion, Realtors should not interpret the prospect of rising rates as ominous. Substantial economic progress has been achieved since the recession ended in 2009.\nThe outlook is for moderate growth and improving conditions. And we are close to achieving the Fed's monetary policy objectives. Although higher interest rates will raise the\nmonthly payment cost of housing for some new borrowers, policy is not disconnected from factors that should improve overall affordability—factors like wage growth and\nemployment prospects.\nSupply factors\nMy colleagues and I are, however, concerned about the housing affordability trend—both rental and purchase—for lower-income households. Many urban areas are seeing a\ndistressing shortage of affordable housing. Research done recently by the McKinsey Global Institute concludes that, in California for example, 50 percent of households\ncannot afford housing in their local market. McKinsey goes on to argue \"...virtually none of California's low-income and very-low-income households can afford the local cost\nof housing.\" I would argue that the supply of affordable housing is not only an economic inclusion issue, but one that affects labor mobility and the overall efficiency of urban\neconomies that increasingly are the dominant force in national output.\nWith that problem in mind, let me shift now to supply factors that will influence industry sales next year and over the medium term.\nI don't need to remind this audience that inventories of houses for sale are tight. The months' supply of inventory estimate is below five.\nInventory levels across markets are being limited by available land, available construction labor, and stronger supervisory guidance as regards acquisition, development, and\nconstruction (ADC) lending.\nSince the recession, homebuilders have been more selective in their new home construction projects. Many homebuilders have, of necessity, shifted their development\nactivity well above historic entry-level price points. Today, only 28 percent of newly built homes are priced below $250,000, down from 43 percent before the financial crisis.\nThe homebuilders we talk with cite cost constraints as the driver of this trend.\nThey also mention the regulatory environment of lenders. Lending for acquisition, development, and construction activity has tightened considerably. Banks that went into the\nGreat Recession with the highest exposures to ADC loans typically had the most financial distress, and many failed. As a result, supervisory guidance has become more\n\n\fexplicit about concentration levels and project risk when it comes to this type of lending. Also, new consumer compliance regulations have added complexity and associated\ncosts to real estate transactions.\nLet me close with a few summary thoughts. The housing sector has challenges, of course. But the housing industry's near-term outlook, as I see it, is one of continued\nimprovement in the context of moderate economic growth. The longer-term housing outlook looks promising, supported by demographic trends, employment growth, and\ncredit availability. I think it's prudent to expect a rising interest rate environment, but I would expect the rate environment to stabilize at a lower level than in past periods of\nsustained expansion. Such an environment should promote affordability and a healthy sales market.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions: On the Front Lines\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nOpportunity Finance Network Conference\nAtlanta, GA\nOctober 25, 2016\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in an October 25, 2016, speech to the Opportunity Finance Network Conference in Atlanta, presents his views on\nfinancing community development.\nLockhart says despite economic progress achieved, the circumstances of many urban and rural low-income communities remain very difficult. He believes community\ndevelopment financial institutions—CDFIs—are well positioned to play a pivotal role.\nLockhart notes that CDFIs operate in a fragmented industry community with more than 1,000 individual entities.\nIn his opinion, CDFIs should get to scale in good time or combine with others, and they must adapt to changes in the landscape of financial technology.\nLockhart says we can't assume a community has the capacity to absorb development capital in ways that move a distressed place and its residents ahead.\nIn Lockhart's view, a set of circumstances is coalescing in the nation's economy that will put CDFIs on the front lines of efforts to address troubling, perhaps even\ndangerous, distributional imbalances.\n\nI'd like to begin by welcoming OFN to Atlanta. This city is an apt venue for engaging the issues at the heart of this conference.\nLast week I visited Detroit and spoke to some civic leaders who also participate on the board of directors of the Federal Reserve facility there. One\ndirector called the experience in Detroit a \"tale of two cities.\" I understood him to mean that for years the experience of the professional and relatively\naffluent class in Detroit has been radically different from the living experience of the working poor.\nAtlanta's circumstances are not as extreme, but sharp contrasts are evident here as well. Atlanta is one of the fastest-growing urban regions in the\ncountry, yet Atlanta is one of the worst for economic mobility. This community continues to attract new residents, to attract business operations\nrelocating from elsewhere, and to attract new investment. Yet real per capita income today is lower than it was in 2000, and we have pockets of entrenched poverty and\ndisinvestment.\nThis conference is about community development finance and especially the role of community development financial institutions, or CDFIs. And the theme of this\nconference is \"rethink.\"\nQuite frankly, I don't consider it necessary to do a comprehensive, top-to-bottom rethink of the role, business model, and operating methods of CDFIs. I am a fan of CDFIs. I\nlike your dedicated focus on funding mostly unbankable entities, providing technical assistance, and operating with intimate knowledge of your community's dynamics and\nyour borrowers' daily business details.\nBefore joining the Federal Reserve, I worked as a banker and investor up and down the borrower quality continuum. I had a lot of experience with high-risk, relatively\nimmature businesses. I oversaw a number of small business finance companies. I also chaired an investment group called the Small Enterprise Investment Funds that made\nequity investments in the equivalent of underserved communities in emerging markets around the world. To generalize from my experience, lending to and investing in\nrelatively young, undercapitalized, entrepreneur-led enterprises is hard. That said, there is often a difference between perceived risk and actual risk, and skilled lenders and\ninvestors can exploit that distinction. CDFIs inhabit such a market space and do it quite effectively.\nSo, while I might question the need for a complete rethink of what you're doing, I do accept that it's healthy to revisit and refresh assumptions from time to time. This is what I\nintend to do today. I consider this an opportune time because, although we're in the eighth year of recovery following the Great Recession, progress has been uneven. You\nconfront that reality daily.\nI must mention here that Federal Reserve officials who participate in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)—the body that makes monetary policy—are now in a quiet\nperiod as regards public remarks. There is a meeting of the FOMC next week, so I cannot address current issues influencing monetary policy. This frees me to focus on the\ntopic at hand—financing community development.\nYou may ask why your central bank—an institution appropriately concerned with macroeconomic conditions and interest-rate policy—in short, the big picture—is involved in\ncommunity development and community development finance.\nThe Fed's community and economic development work is rooted in our bank supervisory responsibility for enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). We\ncontinue to oversee the banking industry's performance about their CRA responsibilities, but we have built on that experience by devoting some resources directly to\nmicroeconomic issues of communities, especially low- and moderate-income communities. Our Community and Economic Development team spearheads that activity.\nEach Federal Reserve Bank adapts its program to its own geography. Five Federal Reserve banks as well as the Board of Governors in Washington are represented at this\nmeeting. Colleagues from Reserve Banks in Chicago, Minneapolis, Richmond, and St. Louis are here to engage in this discussion. As I said, each has its own unique\nprogram.\nIn our district, which encompasses much of the Southeast, we are specializing in four interconnected areas—workforce development, housing and neighborhood\nrevitalization, small business, and community development finance.\n\n\fOur resources for this work are limited, so we've put emphasis on research that can be useful to practitioners along with partnership efforts conducted in various ways. Let\nme drop some names. We're partnering with leaders in community development finance like Donna Gambrell (we're lucky to have Donna as a visiting scholar at the Atlanta\nFed); Bill Bynum with HOPE Credit Union in Mississippi; Ignacio Esteban with the Florida Community Loan Fund; Grace Fricks with ACE; and Clint Gwin from Pathway\nLending. They have been helping us understand the ground-level challenges facing the communities and enterprises served by CDFIs.\nIn spite of the economic progress achieved, the circumstances of many urban and rural low-income communities remain very difficult. Everyone here is all too familiar with\nthe human and community face of income inequality, concentrated poverty, and economic exclusion. Demands for redress are growing louder, in my opinion.\nIf, in the coming years, American society pulls together to address these problems in a more aggressive way, I believe CDFIs are well positioned to play a pivotal role. You\nspecialize in serving underserved markets. You grasp the complex dynamics at play in distressed areas. And you invest with an eye on both financial and social returns.\nSo, it seems to me that a front-and-center question is…are you ready? Let me flesh out that question. Are CDFIs ready to be the vehicle of choice to confront the challenges\nof inequality, economic and financial exclusion, and the deficit of, and the underfunding of, entrepreneurial ventures in low- and moderate-income communities?\nI certainly hope this conference will bring forth perspectives on the question. Let me offer some tentative views—views that are informed by my organization's contacts with\nknowledgeable figures in your industry.\nFirst, CDFIs operate in a fragmented industry community. Since the U.S. Treasury started certifying CDFIs in the late ‘90s, the population of CDFIs has expanded to more\nthan a thousand individual entities. The industry includes both regulated depositories and unregulated loan funds. Most are relatively small.\nIt's my impression that a large number of the thousand or so certified CDFIs have not reached operational sustainability. Given their mission, this is not an indictment. Rather,\nit's an attempt to point out obvious implications—get to scale in good time or combine with others.\nI think a period of consolidation can be anticipated. Sustainability pressures may call for leaders of CDFIs who can identify partnering opportunities that bring efficiency\nbenefits while preserving the market knowledge of smaller, place-based organizations.\nA second observation is CDFIs must adapt to changes in the landscape of financial technology. We're in a period of significant industry disruption in banking, small enterprise\nfinance, and personal finance. Innovative business models and methods are exposing costly and inefficient business practices in areas such as payments, borrower\nidentification and loan origination, loan processing, and customer interface. Jeremy Nowack pointed to this challenge in a provocative paper published by OFN earlier this\nyear. He said, \"FinTech should be considered a wake-up call for CDFIs.\"\nMy third and last point relates to capacity constraints—not of CDFIs narrowly, but of distressed communities where CDFIs attempt to operate. Perhaps it's a tautology, but\ncapacity constraints are most prevalent where challenges are greatest. We cannot facilely assume a community has the capacity to absorb development capital in ways that\nmove a distressed place and its residents ahead.\nI've come to understand that the challenges you all confront in your lending and technical assistance activities are often most intractable where there are few institutional\npartners to work with. Whether you are financing a charter school, financing development of affordable housing, financing the building of a health clinic, or financing a small\nbusiness of some kind, you need partners who can execute.\nUnfortunately, those partners don't exist everywhere. New research performed by Fed community development teams in Atlanta and Philadelphia looked at philanthropic\ngrants for community economic development. The research assessed the local factors that make a place more or less likely to attract funding from larger foundations. Our\nresearchers found a statistical relationship between population and grant dollars received per capita. They also found that places with a greater density of nongovernmental\norganizations (NGOs) operating locally are more likely to attract funding. Perhaps this too is an obvious finding. Places with more capacity—a more built-out institutional\nlandscape—attract greater amounts of philanthropic funding from large foundations.\nMy team here developed an online tool called \"Following the Money\" that can be used to visualize the flow of foundation grants and the capacity constraints that limit such\nflows.\nOther research work on the capital absorption capacity of communities suggests they struggle to absorb double or triple bottom-line investments. This is not because the\nsupply of social impact capital is constrained, but because development projects are disconnected. They are often not clearly aligned with a set of visible local priorities. They\nmay be siloed in one department or agency. This work leads us to urge communities seeking investment to organize their demand for capital into an agreed set of priorities\nyielding a pipeline of investable opportunities. This is true, it seems, even in larger communities with a dense network of NGOs.\nWhether it involves a small metro area or a large urban region, agreement on community priorities does not come easily or automatically, I know. Lately, I've been musing\nabout the role of volunteer civic leadership in communities of all sizes. It seems to me there is an element of serendipity in the fortune of communities. Some are blessed with\nthe right mix of committed, talented leaders at a community's time of need. Some communities may not be so blessed. You might call this the \"hero theory of community\nprogress.\" In Detroit last week, I heard the uplifting story of civic leaders stepping up when the city had its back to the wall.\nI'll be retiring from the Federal Reserve next February. I have served in my position over a momentous 10-year period that spans the financial crisis, a deep recession, and a\nprotracted recovery. The country has come a long way since 2008 and 2009, but there is more to do. In my view, a set of circumstances is coalescing in the nation's economy\nthat will put CDFIs on the front lines of efforts to address troubling, perhaps even dangerous, distributional imbalances. I'll repeat the important question: are you ready? I do\nhope this conference will bring forth a response to the readiness question in a way that inspires and empowers your organizations.\nAs I said, I am a fan of CDFIs, and my Reserve Bank is deeply engaged with the CDFI community in our region. We look forward to continuing our work with your community.\nThank you for what you do.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\n\fRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speakers Bureau\n\n\f"

It's the third most populous state, so consumer activity here contributes significantly to trends in\nconsumer activity nationwide. Tourism—so important to this state—tells us a lot about the state of mind of domestic consumers and their propensity\nto spend. Residential real estate development in Florida is a signal of national (and also international) demand conditions and consumer confidence.\nI could go on, but the point is that Florida, with its diverse sub-economies and cultures, is an important window into the national economic picture.\nTrends, both positive and negative, and economic challenges in Florida have national relevance.\nToday I plan to do three things with my remarks. I will interpret the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to leave policy\nunchanged at our recent meeting of September 20 and 21. I will offer my assessment of the current state of the national economy and the outlook.\nAnd I will discuss how human capital influences economic outcomes.\nGrowth is a central issue of our times. Growth results from rising numbers in the workforce, enhancement of their tools, and improvement of their skills.\nAt the national level, a central question today is, why is actual and potential growth restrained? Over the last several quarters, my FOMC colleagues and I have been\nprogressively writing down our estimates of medium-term and long-run growth in official forecasts. There are a number of contributing factors. An important one is low growth\nof labor productivity. So another question is, why does the trend of productivity growth continue to run low? In my remarks I'll provide my personal views on these questions,\nand I'll offer some thoughts on state and local workforce development efforts as a way to improve labor productivity.\nAs always, all my remarks will be personal views. I'm not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the FOMC.\nStance of monetary policy\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, the FOMC left the policy interest rate—the federal funds rate—unchanged at our last meeting. The policy rate target range is set just 1/4 of a\npercent above a setting of zero, for all practical purposes.\nYou may also be aware that on three occasions in recent years, the FOMC undertook bond-buying programs in an effort to keep longer-maturity interest rates low. These\nprograms swelled the central bank's balance sheet to around $4.5 trillion today. The FOMC is maintaining the status quo balance sheet as part of a quite accommodative\nstance of policy.\nIn the statement following last week's meeting, the Committee acknowledged that the national economy is improving and the case for a policy rate increase has\nstrengthened. Nonetheless, the decision was to stand pat for the time being. That phrase—for the time being—appeared in the statement suggesting, as I see it, that a\nchange in policy could occur before long. However, I did support the consensus view that, before taking the next move, it makes sense to see a little more evidence of\nprogress toward our statutory policy objectives.\nState of the economy and outlook\nThose statutory policy objectives are full employment and low and stable inflation. They are the north stars of monetary policy. So, decisions of the Committee to adjust policy\nsettings are highly influenced by our collective assessment of how far the economy is from the goals of full employment and a sustainable rate of inflation close to 2 percent.\nThink of full employment and 2 percent inflation as indications of an economy operating at steady state. When we've achieved those two objectives on a sustainable basis,\npolicy should be set at neutral—neither intentionally stimulative nor intentionally restrictive.\nIn my opinion, the national economy remains short of these two steady-state conditions, but not by a lot. An evaluation of employment conditions ought to take into\nconsideration a wide set of indicators, including conditions of various age cohorts and demographic groups. That said, the headline national unemployment rate is a useful\ngauge. Unemployment in August stood at 4.9 percent. This is within the range of last week's estimates from FOMC participants of the long-run sustainable unemployment\nrate.\n\n\fLikewise, there are a variety of ways to assess inflation. The measure preferred by the FOMC stood at 0.8 percent for the year through July. Headline inflation is influenced\nby volatile elements like prices of gasoline and foodstuffs. If these categories of prices prone to ups and downs are excluded, core inflation over the last 12 months stands at\n1.6 percent. There is some difference of opinion among economists and my colleagues whether or not the core inflation shortfall is all that material.\nAs a policymaker, I take both the current employment picture and recent inflation indicators as encouraging. We're closing in on our objectives. We're nearing our objectives\ndespite a relatively weak pace of growth.\nThe economy expanded slowly in the first half of the year at a rate closer to 1 percent. The Atlanta Fed's estimate of growth in the third quarter, the current quarter just about\nto end, is slightly below 3 percent. We believe this pickup in the pace of growth will continue through the fourth quarter such that growth for the year overall will likely end up\njust shy of 2 percent.\nA 2 percent annual rate of growth has been the story of our economy's recovery since the recession ended in the summer of 2009. We've made substantial progress even\nwith sluggish growth, particularly in broad measures of employment.\nThe reality of a solidly performing labor market suggests that even at 2 percent, the economy has been running above its long-run potential rate of growth. The thought is that\nidle or underutilized resources—including labor resources—are absorbed into the economy when it operates for a period above steady state.\nPotential economic growth is limited by growth in the size of the labor force and how productive that labor force is. I'll repeat that in a slightly more complicated way.\nPopulation growth, adjusted for participation, times productivity yields economic growth.\nBoth labor force participation and the rate of growth of labor productivity have been constraining potential for a number of years.\nLet me elaborate further on each factor. The explanation for declining participation is multifaceted, but a significant portion of the decline is explained by demographics. Baby\nboomers are reaching retirement age, and although some are extending their working lives, their participation overall is falling. Florida, of course, is the beneficiary of this\nphenomenon from the perspective of population growth.\nThere are other things affecting participation—for example, millennials staying in school longer and two-earner families reverting to one earner as the economy has improved.\nRecently we have seen a slight uptick in participation. I attribute this to people who used to be out of the workforce rejoining the workforce, encouraged, in my view, by the\ncontinuing growth of jobs. Monthly payroll job growth has averaged 204,000 over the last year and 232,000 over the last three months. I expect we will continue to see job\ngrowth comfortably above the number needed to absorb population growth. So I expect we'll see either a further drop in the unemployment rate or a continuation for a while\nof the reversal of the participation trend. Possibly both. That said, my medium- to long-term assumption is a persistent decline in participation. Demography is destiny, you\nmight say. It would require an implausible rise in the labor force participation rate to fully offset the predictable retirement numbers of baby boomers.\nLabor productivity growth\nLet me now comment on labor productivity growth. I believe a good deal of the explanation of weak productivity growth relates to weak spending on capital equipment.\nInvestment in the structures, equipment, software, and other intellectual property products used by the labor force has been very soft since the early years following the end\nof the recession. When we at the Atlanta Fed ask business leaders across the Southeast about reticence to invest more, we hear a range of reasons. In Louisiana, we hear\nabout the severe cutback in drilling structures investment because of the fall of oil prices. This is just part of the picture, however. A broader sample of businesspeople—\nrepresenting both small businesses and larger enterprises—tells us that businesses are cautious about predicting future demand in a low-growth economic environment.\nAnd, very frequently, we hear references to greater perceived uncertainty—geopolitical, domestic politics, regulation, fiscal, financial stability.\nIn my latest forecast of economic performance through 2019, I assumed a modest pickup in capital spending just to sustain a 2 percent rate of growth over that timespan.\nImportantly, I am not assuming an increase of capital deepening across the economy of a magnitude that would rapidly and meaningfully boost productivity.\nI'll repeat the simple growth equation from my introduction. Growth results from rising numbers participating in the workforce, enhancement of their tools, and improvement of\ntheir skills. With declining participation—even while the population is growing—and weak investment in capital goods, the country has challenges achieving strong growth.\nHow to respond? I believe workforce development programs have a place in the response to these challenges.\nThe role of workforce development\nOver the last year or so, my community and economic development team at the Atlanta Fed has sharpened its focus on workforce development systems and policies. The\nFederal Reserve System overall has stepped up resources devoted to workforce development research and engagement of stakeholders.\nWe believe workforce development represents fertile ground. I'll point to five opportunities.\nFirst, the workforce development landscape is fragmented and could be better coordinated as an industry. Our community and economic development team engaged with a\ngroup of 25 organizations across metro Atlanta engaged in workforce development. Atlanta is a representative large city. The group found a lot of duplication of services and\nlimited communication between and among organizations. There is much scope for greater collaboration.\nSecond, too many providers of workforce development programs are not sufficiently aligned with employers. In a recent study of just over 200 providers in Atlanta's workforce\ndevelopment community, we found only 30 percent had a relationship with an employer.\nI'll note that Florida has taken an important first step in broadening connections to the business community by rebranding all of its public workforce boards under the\nCareerSource banner. This common brand has helped to make resources more available and understandable to businesses and job seekers.\nThird, programs do not operate at large enough scale to meet the needs of employers and workers. We see potential to expand programs that have a demonstrated record of\nsuccess. We're also of the view that states in the forefront of workforce development efforts would be well advised to leverage the power of existing resources such as\ncommunity and technical college systems.\n\n\fFourth, the funding situation of workforce development programs is complex. There has been significant reliance on federal and philanthropic grant funding. There are\nmultiple federal programs that fund workforce development, but they have been in decline. Funding from state and local governments is uneven. Funding challenges make\ngood programs hard to scale. My colleagues believe that new financial models are needed to attract funding to workforce development programs. We're working on this.\nFinally, improved data collection and dissemination will help direct resources to programs that are effective. We recently invited state labor data directors in our region to a\nmeeting to discuss their data systems—what they thought was working and where they were seeking improvement. Representatives from CareerSource Florida and the\nFlorida Department of Economic Opportunity joined in the discussion. They pointed to improvement in the state's longitudinal data system. The intent is to evaluate the\neffectiveness of training programs for workers over the long term. We also heard about efforts to source local information across Florida on prevailing salaries in order to\ndirect resources to programs that fill actual labor market gaps and deliver higher and more immediate returns on investment.\nThese are opportunities—opportunities to bring workforce development efforts to bear on labor productivity and, ultimately, growth of potential and realized economic growth.\nAn important state like Florida ought to be a leader in this movement.\nWe all want to see stronger growth. As a policymaker, I would like to see growth modestly above potential for the immediate future to absorb remaining labor market slack. I\nwould also like to improve potential—that is, I'd like to find ways to improve the longer-run trend rate of growth. I believe doing so involves strategies that address\nfundamentals like our economy's endowment of human capital.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speakers Bureau\n\n\f"

You will see me twice today and will get a full dose of Fedspeak. I will present\nsome views in the coming minutes, and then this afternoon I will moderate a discussion with the chair of the Atlanta Fed, Tom Fanning, who is the\nchairman, president, and CEO of Southern Company, based here in Atlanta. My colleague Dave Altig, executive vice president and director of\nresearch at the Atlanta Fed, will also speak this afternoon.\nFor those of you who closely follow commentary of Fed officials, today is your last chance to hear views of the FOMC (or Federal Open Market\nCommittee) participants for a week and a half. As I'm sure you are aware, tomorrow we begin the observance of a blackout period on public\ncomments related to monetary policy ahead of the FOMC meeting.\nFinancial markets seem to be very sensitive to remarks of Fed speakers at the moment. I'd like to avoid any chance of contributing to market\nvolatility in advance of the September 20 and 21 meeting, so this morning I don't plan to offer an opinion on what will likely be done at the\nSeptember, November, or December meetings.\nRather, I will talk about what I think are the most important considerations for a policymaker at this juncture and how I'm weighting certain considerations.\nYou are all familiar with the Fed disclaimer. I will offer my individual views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the FOMC.\nSummary economic picture\nIn interviews at the Jackson Hole meeting in late August, I took the position that if the incoming data leading up to next week's meeting remained consistent overall with my\nsense of the economy, I would encourage \"serious discussion\" of a policy rate increase.\nNotwithstanding a few recent weak monthly reports—from the Institute for Supply Management, for example—I am satisfied at this point that conditions warrant that serious\ndiscussion.\nI believe the economy is sustaining sufficient momentum to substantially achieve the Committee's monetary policy objectives in an acceptable medium-term time horizon.\nLet me provide a high-level summary of the economic picture, as I see it, and then I will go into a little more depth on key points. The economy is expanding at a moderate\npace fueled mostly by growth of consumer activity. Business investment spending remains subdued. Jobs growth remains on a positive trend. I expect a slowdown as we\napproach full employment. Underlying inflation continues to run about 1/2 percent below target. Wage pressures are accelerating and broadening out as we approach full\nemployment.\nIn its fundamentals, the economy seems to be chugging along, not stalling out. I'll go a little deeper on some of these points.\nA more detailed look at certain elements\nFirst, growth: After relatively weak growth over the first half of the year, I expect a stronger second half. Recent incoming evidence has pushed the Atlanta Fed's third-quarter\ntracking estimate above 3 percent annualized growth. I'm referring to GDPNow, our real-time nowcasting tool. The author of GDPNow, Pat Higgins, will be speaking at this\nconference tomorrow.\nStrong readings on consumer spending, a solid report on private construction activity, and a positive signal from the latest factory orders numbers have contributed to our\nsense that growth is accelerating in the third quarter.\nI probably don't have to explain to this audience that there are error bands around our tracking estimate. At this point in the quarter, the 70 percent confidence interval\nstretches from 2 1/4 percent annualized growth to 4 1/2 percent. A number of other forecasters have a point estimate in the mid-twos, so I believe I'm on solid ground saying\nwe'll see stronger growth in the third quarter than we did over the preceding three quarters.\n\n\fI see full-year growth in 2016 coming in a little below 2 percent, just shy of the growth rate we've seen, on average, over the seven-plus years of recovery. With the weak first\nand second quarters, arithmetic produces that shortfall, but I consider the basic narrative of growth around 2 percent to remain intact. From that perspective, I see full-year\n2016 as more of the same.\nEmployment\nTurning to employment, we are continuing to make progress toward our full employment mandate. Jobs growth has averaged 232,000 over the past three months, in line with\nthe trend over the past year. I don't rely on any single indicator to judge the health of the labor market. Various measures of unemployment and underemployment are inside\na range I would consider at or very close to full employment.\nAdmittedly, the headline unemployment rate has leveled off in recent months. But I attribute this to an increased flow of people into the labor force, along with fewer exits.\nParticipation appears to have stabilized and ticked up slightly. This higher participation is likely a response to the ongoing, relatively strong employer demand for workers as\nsuggested by surveys of job openings and measures of churn.\nThe 12-month trend in payroll jobs growth has slowed a bit from its peak in the beginning of 2015, and I think it's reasonable to expect some further slowing in jobs growth as\nthe economy approaches full employment. Importantly, I consider the most recent number—151,000—to be comfortably above the various estimates of \"break even,\" the\nnumber needed to hold the unemployment rates constant. This suggests to me that we will continue to make progress in absorbing underutilized labor resources. While it is\nhard to pinpoint exactly when the labor market has reached full employment, I think the balance of evidence suggests the residual slack in the labor market is relatively small.\nInflation\nThat said, we are not yet seeing inflation data confirming that we're near full employment. I find the continuing shortfall from the Committee's inflation target and the\nambiguous evidence of movement toward target to be a frustrating element in the picture.\nHeadline inflation is roughly 1 percentage point below target, while measures of underlying inflation are trending about half a percentage point below target.\nA number of factors are at work in any given period. To my way of thinking, inflation experience basically is a function of inflation expectations (the anchor), resource slack\n(the Phillips curve component), and transitory influences such as commodity prices, the dollar's effect on import prices, and seasonal factors.\nAs I've said, I see the slack component as modest. And unquestionably, transitory factors have had significant influence on headline numbers.\nAs regards expectations, even with declines in some expectations measures over the past year or so, I am satisfied inflation expectations remain stable and adequately\nanchored.\nMy staff has done some work recently looking at the spread of inflation expectations. Our conclusion is that the typical forecaster or business decision maker's inflation\nprojection has remained fairly constant over the last few years, but the distribution of inflation expectations has tightened up. Those expecting a breakout of inflation to the\nupside have adjusted their expectations lower.\nI am a big believer in a dashboard approach to assessing the run rate of inflation. So, working with my team at the Atlanta Fed, I look at a wide range of price measures. For\npolicy purposes, we are always trying to discern the fundamental underlying behavior of prices separate from transitory influences. Recently we have been closely monitoring\nthe Dallas Fed's trimmed-mean inflation index as a reasonable proxy for the underlying inflation trend.\nThis measure of inflation has been very constant for four years now. It's been consistently around 1.6 percent and has varied from that reading by only two-tenths or less. By\nthis measure, progress toward the Committee's inflation objective appears to have stalled. The inflation data overall have not been suggesting disinflation or deflation, but the\nflat trend line is enough below target that, in my opinion, the shortfall cannot be considered immaterial. I find this to be an awkward state of affairs.\nYou will recall that last December, when the Committee decided to raise the policy rate for the first time in almost a decade, accompanying communication used the\nexpression \"reasonably confident\" when projecting the inflation outlook on which the decision was, in part, premised.\nI voted for the increase and supported the rationale. In my public comments after the meeting, I emphasized my desire to see tangible evidence of rising inflation in 2016 to\nsupport subsequent rate increases. At times during this year, we detected hints of accelerating inflation, but I have to say the evidence is not overwhelmingly convincing. I am\nstill relying on \"reasonable confidence\" to a greater extent than evidence in hand. My base case forecast is that inflation will trend toward target once the slack in our labor\nand product markets is sufficiently reduced. Given ongoing improvement in labor markets and output, I believe that process is continuing, and, therefore, confidence is\njustified.\nPolicy setting in this context\nFor me, the inflation outlook is a very important consideration. I am putting a lot of weight on it. You've heard my base case inflation scenario, but I acknowledge the need to\nconsider other narratives. I cannot totally dismiss an alternative scenario that describes the economy as stuck in a state of relatively weak growth, low productivity growth,\nand soft inflation. As you well know, this perspective is sometimes associated with the secular stagnation thesis. This line of thinking also shares ground with the attention\ngiven recently to the level of the neutral rate—both short-term R-star and the longer-term equilibrium policy rate.\nI have not signed on to this alternative view of an economy stuck in a state of weak performance. My approach to upcoming policy discussions is to hold to my base case\noutlook—one that sees both mandated policy objectives achieved in the medium term. I am treating the alternative scenario as a risk.\nMy base case forecast lines up well with feedback from many people in the economic trenches. Anecdotal reports of my contacts among business and community leaders\npretty consistently have been describing steadily improving economic conditions—not great, but not bad. Most of our business contacts expect continuing growth of demand\nat a moderate pace and accelerating wage pressures. They cite a range of uncertainties restraining capital investment. They perceive their worlds as steadily returning to\nnormal. They are cautiously optimistic for the most part.\nThese soundings of contacts in my region—even if anecdotal—influence how I frame the key questions I need to think about in the weeks preceding an FOMC meeting.\n\n\fAmong these—and I will close on this note—are, first, what is the right policy setting given an outlook of getting to full employment and price stability relatively soon—in the\nnext couple of years? And, if 1.6 percent inflation and 4.9 percent unemployment were all you knew about the economy, would you consider a policy setting one tick above\nthe zero lower bound still appropriate? These are some of the questions on my mind as I approach the next few meetings. I think circumstances call for a lively discussion\nnext week.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speakers Bureau\n\n\f"

Real final sales rose at an annualized rate of 2.4\npercent in the second quarter.\nLockhart is holding to an outlook of moderate growth through 2017. His baseline forecast calls for achievement of the Fed's core monetary policy objectives—full\nemployment and price stability—over the next year and a half.\nLockhart assumes continuing healthy consumer activity and a modest acceleration in business investment.\nLockhart will be watching the incoming data closely for confirmation that his outlook remains valid.\n_______________________________________________________________\nIn late July, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its first estimate of second-quarter growth of gross domestic product (GDP). Growth in the\nquarter was estimated at 1.2 percent annualized. The number was below our expectations at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and below the\npredictions of many others. The report has been treated as a downer. I gave an interview on August 2 and got the question, \"What do you make of\nthe dismal GDP report?\" It's not surprising a GDP report so much below expectations evoked strong reactions.\nWhen the history of the post-recession economic expansion is written, it will be described as a long period of relatively slow growth. Through mid2015, GDP growth averaged a little over 2 percent. Over the last year, GDP growth has averaged just 1.2 percent. Over the first half of 2016, GDP\ngrowth has averaged just 1.0 percent at an annual rate. At face value, it might appear that economic momentum is decelerating.\nAt these low numbers, an apparent decelerating pace of growth would not seem compatible with policymakers' thinking about raising interest rates.\nYet I, as one Fed policymaker, am not prepared to rule out at least one rate hike before year's end.\nToday I will examine the national economy's underlying momentum by decomposing recent GDP growth. I will argue that the headline number overstates weakness last\nquarter. I'll draw attention to real final sales, a subset of GDP, as a better indication of economic momentum. Looked at through the lens of real final sales, the report was not\nso disappointing and is consistent with our experience over much of the recovery that began seven years ago in the summer of 2009.\nI'll also lay out my baseline outlook for the rest of the year and next year, and I'll discuss the key risks I perceive around that outlook. As always, I will be presenting my\nindividual views. I'm not speaking for the Federal Reserve, or for the Federal Open Market Committee, the FOMC.\nGrowth over the recovery\nLet me start by providing some historical context for our current economy. As I said, from the summer of 2009 up to mid-year last year, official readings of growth of economic\noutput had averaged a little over 2 percent.\nIn speeches a couple of years back, I was arguing that although the U.S. economy seemed caught \"in a 2 percent growth world,\" the economy would shortly vault into a 3\npercent world as various headwinds abated. That has not happened.\nIn my official forecasts submitted quarterly as part of the FOMC process, and in my public comments, I have marked down my expectations of what is sufficient growth. I've\ncome to the view that GDP growth at around 2 percent in today's economy is sufficient to achieve the Fed's monetary policy objectives of full employment and price stability\nin a reasonable timeframe.\nWe've seen pretty strong employment performance despite the weaker-than-expected growth of real GDP. From the peak of unemployment in October 2009, the economy\nhas added more than 14 million jobs, and the official unemployment rate has declined to 4.9 percent according to the last report of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for July. In\nthe past 12 months alone, the economy has added two and a half million jobs.\nWhile jobs growth has been impressive, wage growth has been modest over the full period of recovery. Only recently have we begun to detect broad-based wage pressures.\nStill, these wage pressures may be signs we're approaching full employment. Wage inflation can also be a factor in the firming of broad inflation we desire.\nRecent growth story\nOver seven-plus years of moderate growth, the mix of factors contributing or detracting from growth has not been constant. The immediate drivers of and drags on expansion\nhave ebbed and flowed.\nLet me take a moment and walk you through the moving parts, so to speak, of GDP accounting. Estimates of gross domestic product measure total output. The biggest\nelements of total output are goods and services produced and consumed in a given period, the net change in private-sector inventories (inventories produced in the current\nperiod to be consumed later, less those produced earlier and consumed in the current period), the net of exports (output produced here but consumed abroad) and imports\n(output produced abroad but consumed here), and residential and business fixed investment. In addition, roughly a fifth of our economy is government services and\ninvestment.\n\n\fEarly in the recovery, growth was driven by a substantial ramp-up in business investment. One way to understand this is as a catching up of investment deferred during the\nrecession. Business investment included both fixed investment—that is, capital expenditures—and inventory. Consumer activity was fairly weak, except for autos.\nGovernment spending was a drag because of shrinking state and local budgets.\nLater in the recovery, investment trailed off and has recently become a drag on growth. Consumption has strengthened as household wealth and incomes have recovered.\nThis is, in good part, the picture today. Recent economic momentum has been consumer-driven. Inventory drawdown has been a drag on growth over the last five quarters, a\nrather long period. Exports relative to imports remain a drag. Government has moved from a drag on growth to a modest contributor to growth. And very importantly, business\nfixed investment—capital spending by the private sector—continues to be weak. Yes, the drop in energy prices has suppressed oil and gas structures investment, but this is\njust part of the story. Business investment overall has been on a slowing trend since 2012 and has actually declined over the past year.\nBusiness fixed investment\nWeakness in business investment is an unusual phenomenon for an expansion. There are a number of plausible explanations. I will cite some that my team has heard from\nour contacts across the Southeast.\nOur business contacts mention heightened uncertainty—both global and domestic. This has been a recurrent theme for some time.\nSometimes our contacts cite specific events on the horizon. An example would be the recent Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom. Recently I've heard mention of\npolitical uncertainty here in the United States associated with the upcoming election. I don't have direct causal evidence linking weak business investment and current\npolitical uncertainty, but it's possible the election is a factor—maybe not a primary factor—but a factor nonetheless affecting investment decision making.\nRecent research on the effects of uncertainty on economies suggests that even discrete spikes in uncertainty can have prolonged negative impacts on investment activity.\nGiven the seeming frequency of risk events, the picture may just be one of decision makers never getting out of wait-and-see mode.\nSpecific concerns like Brexit have been elements of a general atmosphere of heightened uncertainty fueled by—for example—political dysfunction, distressing fiscal\nscenarios, and worldwide economic and financial developments. Starting with the FOMC's January meeting this year, the Committee has noted in post-meeting statements\nthat risks associated with \"global economic and financial developments\" bear close watching.\nA second frequently cited explanation for a cautious approach to capital investment is businesses projecting relatively weak demand going forward. Firms continue to be\ncautious about an assumption of organic growth. In a number of recent conversations, companies mentioned mergers and acquisitions as their preferred growth strategy\nbecause they are not counting on organic growth.\nA third and related explanation is the lack of direct pricing power and continuing pressure on margins and profits. In this vein, some firms have mentioned excess capacity as\nwell as foreign-sourced product competition responding to global capacity and the stronger dollar.\nAccurately measuring capacity utilization in a large, diverse economy is a challenge. The most familiar monthly measure of capacity utilization—currently calculated to be\naround 75 percent—is pretty narrow in scope. It is derived from a survey of manufacturing, mining, and utilities firms—hardly a comprehensive perspective in a servicesdominated economy. Nonetheless, the figures are interesting. Over the past 30 years, the highs for capacity utilization metrics were around 85 percent. These came in the\nmid-1990s, a period of strong investment growth. In the Great Recession, capacity utilization hit lows in the mid-60 percent area. As I said, today these measures of capacity\nutilization are around 75 percent, and industrial capacity is barely growing. I infer that businesspeople, in the industrial sector at least, have some justification for deferring\ncapital spending on excess capacity grounds.\nBecause my staff and I consider some renewal of business fixed investment to be pivotal, my Atlanta Fed colleagues have taken every opportunity in recent months to ask\nabout capital spending plans and attitudes. Current capital spending is depicted mostly as replacement, productivity-improvement-oriented, or cost-takeout focused. While\nmost of our conversations evinced some longer-term optimism about potential for expansionary, capacity-building investment, we heard little that would suggest a near-term\nreversal of the weak trend.\nBaseline outlook\nI have two key assumptions in my outlook for the second half of 2016 and for 2017. One assumption is continuing healthy consumer activity. I'm not counting on consumption\ngrowth at the brisk pace of more than 4 percent (annual rate) in the second quarter. Consumption growth will probably settle back to something closer to the growth of\nincomes. Last Friday, we received a retail sales report for July. It suggested a slowdown of consumer spending compared to the second quarter. I'm interpreting that\nslowdown as expected moderation, not a cause for alarm.\nA second assumption is a modest acceleration in business investment. I acknowledge there is tension between an assumption of an upswing in business investment and\nwhat people in the business community are saying. For that reason, I'll be watching carefully for signs of a pickup in capital expenditures.\nI'm expecting decision makers' caution regarding capital expenditures to fade, to an extent, as sustained growth of consumer activity proves out over the coming quarters. My\nstaff has performed statistical analysis that suggests that increases in consumer spending tend to lead acceleration of business investment.\nI would argue that most of the fundamentals underpinning growth of consumption are pretty solid. Household balance sheets have been repaired. Employment prospects\nappear reliable, and the number of employed workers is growing. Interest rates are low for many borrowers. Gasoline prices remain low. Personal incomes are rising, and, as\nI said earlier, wage growth is beginning to pick up. Consumer confidence remains high. At the same time, it appears that recent consumption was fueled, in part, by drawing\ndown personal savings. It's unlikely this will last. In my opinion, consumption growth as strong as last quarter isn't required for continued expansion.\nIf you look beyond the troubling headline GDP growth number for the second quarter and study real final sales, a more consistent picture of economic momentum emerges.\n\"Real final sales\" is GDP less inventory swings. The trend of real final sales is a good gauge of ongoing demand conditions. Real final sales rose at an annualized rate of 2.4\npercent in the second quarter, more than a percentage point higher than the headline GDP growth number. Over the last year, growth of real final sales is 1.9 percent. Recent\nexperience is consistent with results over the full seven-year period of expansion. Final sales growth has been fairly steady since 2009.\n\n\fSo, I'm holding to an outlook of moderate growth through 2017. Furthermore, my baseline forecast calls for achievement of the Fed's core monetary policy objectives over\nthe next year and a half.\nJob gains cited in the most recent employment report (for July) were impressive, and gains were broad-based across industries. Taken together with an unemployment rate\nof 4.9 percent and stronger wage growth, I think it is fair to say we are closing in on full employment.\nPrice stability is the companion objective of full employment in the Fed's dual mandate from Congress. Inflation has not yet accelerated to the Committee's target of a 2\npercent run rate, but seems to be moving in a healthy direction. Recent price data hint at the firming of underlying price pressures. I'm reasonably comfortable with a forecast\nof reaching 2 percent by year-end 2017.\nCertainly, there are risks to this hopeful scenario. For example, the U.S. economy is not completely insulated from weakness elsewhere. Judging from recent actions of\nforeign central banks, major economies continue to combat very weak conditions that may worsen. That said, as I explained earlier, the risk that concerns me most is the risk\nthat an upswing in business investment fails to materialize.\nSo, to sum up, I caution against overreacting to the second-quarter headline growth number. Early indications of third-quarter GDP growth suggest a rebound. I don't believe\nmomentum has stalled. I remain confident about prospects in the second half of 2016 and 2017. I will be watching the incoming data closely for confirmation that the outlook\nI've presented here today remains valid. I'm not locked in to any policy position at this stage, but if my confidence in the economy proves to be justified, I think at least one\nincrease of the policy rate could be appropriate later this year.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

He is comfortable with a cautious and patient approach to policy in the near term.\n_______________________________________________________________\nI have visited this part of Idaho several times, but for purposes other than talking about the economy and monetary policy.\nThe Snake River runs through this area. I’ve floated all three gorgeous sections of the south fork of the Snake testing my fly-fishing skills against the\nwily trout that inhabit the river.\nI am no expert fly-fisher, but I've had good instructors and read a bunch of books on the sport. Before ever throwing a line, a fly-fisher has to read the\nwater. Reading the water involves identifying areas where the fish are most likely to be holding on that particular day. Considerations include the\nspeed and depth of the flowing water, soft spots in the flow made by rocks, trees, and eddies, and places where aquatic insects are emerging.\nFly-fishers are always looking for signs of rising fish. This tells you they are feeding on the surface of the water. A hatch of emerging insects is a\nfeast for fish and usually makes for good fishing if you can \"match the hatch\" with your artificial fly.\nSometimes it happens that you have a fishing outing planned for a day just after a storm has passed through. Bad luck. Storms can make the water cloudy and force the fish\ndown to lower depths. In such circumstances there’s little activity on the surface, and the fishing may not be so good. A dry fly-fisher just has to exercise a little patience until\nthe waters clear. I've found, in any event, that a bad day on the river is better than a good day at the office.\nThis may be a tortured metaphor, I admit, for current conditions Fed policymakers are facing. Brexit amounts to a storm that has clouded the economic waters. For the very\nnear term, I see little choice but to exercise some patience and let the picture clarify.\nI will expand on this theme in my remarks today. Here's what I plan to cover today: The bison in the room is obviously Brexit and what it means for the U.S. economy.\nWhether fully deserved or not, Brexit is being treated as a seminal event evoking a before-and-after comparison of perspectives on the economic outlook. So first, I’ll walk\nyou through my outlook before the momentous referendum of June 23. I’ll follow that with my after perspective, that is, my outlook in light of the uncertainty brought on by\nBrexit. I’ll also add some comments on how I think about uncertainty as a factor influencing economic performance.\nAs always, these will be my personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\nOutlook before Brexit\nLet me take you back to the beginning of the year, just after the FOMC made the decision at its December meeting to raise the policy rate by 25 basis points. The so-called\nliftoff decision was anticipated through much of 2015, and when the decision was made at the meeting in mid-December, it was the first increase in the federal funds rate in\nalmost a decade.\nAs 2016 began, I foresaw a year of steady, moderate, above-trend growth. I expected a pace of growth slightly above 2 percent. I expected this momentum to deliver\ncontinuing movement toward full employment. I also expected a firming of the inflation rate with clear evidence of movement in the direction of the Committee’s inflation\ntarget of 2 percent. Based on this outlook, I was among the FOMC participants who forecast four rate increases over the coming year. I have since cut back that projection.\nThe first quarter had a spell of financial market turbulence lasting the better part of six weeks. The volatility was apparently caused by a number of global economic concerns\nincluding the slowdown in China, the selloff of Chinese equities, declining oil and commodity prices, the resulting weakness of commodity-producing emerging markets, and\nthe perceived tightening by the Fed. The market turbulence subsided in mid-February.\nFor a variety of reasons, first-quarter growth was weak. The first estimate was a mere 0.5 percent annual rate of growth. This was ultimately revised higher to a 1.1 percent\nrate of growth, still quite weak compared to my forecast assumption for the year overall.\nThe employment markets in the first quarter seemed strong compared to the growth indications. Labor market data—including monthly payroll jobs growth—continued to\nshow the strong momentum measured in 2015.\n\n\fWhen official estimates of second-quarter growth are in hand, my staff and I believe we’ll see a much stronger number than the first quarter’s. Our expectation is based on\nthe output of our tracking estimate, called GDPNow. This is a nowcast as opposed to a forecast. As data are released, our model estimates the current quarter (or the justended quarter) in real time. Our most recent estimate of annualized second-quarter growth is 2.3 percent. We expect the official reading to be in that vicinity.\nThe second-quarter bounceback reflected continuing strength in consumer spending. We believe growth of consumer spending, at an annual rate, exceeded 4 percent in the\nsecond quarter. That’s a very brisk pace of consumer activity. Typically, consumer spending is influenced by factors such as the outlook for steady employment, real income\ngrowth, and the health of household balance sheets. Consumer fundamentals have been solid for several months and remain so, in my opinion.\nWhile growth seems to have accelerated in the second quarter compared to the first, the incoming data overall have been mixed. The employment report for May was\npublished the first Friday in June. As you may be aware, it was disappointing. The monthly net growth of payroll jobs, even adjusting for the Verizon strike, was weak, and\nmonthly numbers were revised lower back through March. At the time of its release, this report seemed to indicate that employment momentum had been slowing starting in\nthe first quarter and throughout the second quarter.\nBecause of the doubts raised by the May employment report and the timing of the Brexit vote a few days after the June FOMC meeting, I was comfortable with the\nCommittee's decision to keep policy on hold.\nIn preparation for that meeting, I made modest downward revisions to my growth forecast, but I have not really changed in any significant way my basic outlook for this year\nand the medium term. I continue to expect growth at a pace of around 2 percent per annum. This rate of growth is adequate to continue to absorb any remaining labor\nresource slack. Although inflation, by key measures, is still below target, I continue to expect the inflation rate to move higher and be near the Committee’s target in 2017.\nCurrent economic performance\nThis, then, was my sense of the domestic economy in advance of the Brexit referendum. Most of the data we've received recently is consistent with this base-case outlook.\nHowever, recent data releases mostly cover periods before June 23. Still, I have no basis—statistical or anecdotal—for assuming any significant change in economic\nmomentum since June 23.\nAs of today, in mid-July, domestic demand appears to be holding up well. As I said, consumer fundamentals remain sound. Growth of personal consumption is robust. Auto\nsales (that is, light vehicle sales) remain strong—above 16 million units annualized. However, we do hear reports that sales at recent levels may be difficult to sustain.\nBusiness investment remains subdued, and second-quarter residential investment has weakened compared to the first quarter. But exports have improved recently, pulling\nup the manufacturing sector. Oil prices have remained between $45 and $50 a barrel, reducing the drag from declining “mining” structures investment. While the picture\npresented by recent data is mixed, overall the economy is performing adequately to substantially accomplish our monetary policy objectives in 2017, in my opinion.\nThe healthy employment report we received on July 8 buttresses this view. Payroll jobs growth in June, even after netting out the return of striking Verizon workers, was\nstrong and quite broad-based. Many of the negative signals in May’s data reversed course. Over the past several months, it does appear that the trend in employment growth\nhas slowed somewhat from the pace seen last year. However, I think this slowing is consistent with an economy operating close to full employment.\nBrexit\nLet me now turn to the impact of Brexit. The referendum outcome surprised many observers, me included. It roiled financial markets in the days just after the vote, but very\nimportantly, the functioning of financial markets has been generally quite orderly.\nAfter a bout of volatility, financial conditions have mostly returned to the status quo before June 23. The broad dollar foreign exchange index is roughly unchanged from a\nmonth ago. The VIX index of financial volatility rose but then settled back into a normal range.\nA notable exception is the 10-year Treasury note yield, which has touched historic lows. I attribute much of the recent decline to safe haven flows reflecting a risk-off posture\nimmediately following the referendum.\nIt's too early to sound the \"all clear\" as regards financial market stability. Fed and other policymakers will need to stay on alert for signs of instability severe enough to pose a\nthreat to the broad economy. So far, the financial market turbulence we’ve seen does not seem to have caused direct harm to the country’s economy. As many have stated, it\nis not a \"Lehman moment.\"\nIn my view, a more nettlesome question is what Brexit might mean for U.S. economic prospects over the medium and longer term. I'll offer some tentative views from two\naltitudes.\nFirst, Brexit has raised the general uncertainty quotient at work in the world. The range of plausible (or perhaps I should say, not totally implausible) adverse political and\nsystemic scenarios is very broad at this moment. Economic consequences of the Brexit decision could play out over years.\nWhat would plausible adverse scenarios actually mean for the U.S. economy? At this point, I don’t think it's possible to make a prediction with much confidence. Only very\ntentative and very general assertions can be made, as I see things. Elevated and protracted uncertainty will not help growth prospects of an economy constrained by low\nbusiness fixed investment. Weak productivity growth is at least partially explained by subdued capital investment. Uncertainty that reduces business fixed investment activity\nis not helpful.\nMore immediately, there is the question of direct impact of Brexit on our economy. Negative effects could materialize through the trade channel if there is a sustained\nrealignment of the dollar-pound exchange rate. We might also see similar effects in our trade with Europe and the euro area.\nImmediately following the vote, there has been a lot of effort by a number of credible parties to estimate direct near-term impacts. Again, it's early, but I'm persuaded the\ndirect impact over a short time horizon will not be all that great.\nSo, to summarize my view of Brexit effects: negligible near-term effect; a risk factor over the medium term; higher uncertainty that could amount to a persistent economic\nheadwind.\n\n\fThinking about uncertainty\nI want to make a few comments about uncertainty as a factor influencing economic performance.\nThe minutes of the June FOMC meeting clearly pointed to uncertainty about employment momentum and the outcome of the vote in Britain as factors in the Committee’s\ndecision to keep policy unchanged. I supported that decision and gave weight to those two uncertainties in my thinking.\nAt the same time, I viewed both the implications of the June jobs report and the outcome of the Brexit vote as uncertainties with some resolution over a short time horizon.\nWe’ve seen, now, that the vote outcome may be followed by a long tail of uncertainty of quite a different character.\nSince the Brexit decision of the British people materialized, economic commentators have invoked heightened uncertainty as a reason to be apprehensive. To repeat, the\nconsequences of Brexit may play out over a number of years, and the associated uncertainty could become an economic headwind.\nIf uncertainty is a real causative factor in economic slowdowns, it needs to be better understood. Policymaking would be aided by better measurement tools. For example, it\nwould help me as a policymaker if we had a firmer grip on the various channels through which uncertainty affects decision-making of economic actors.\nI have been thinking about the different kinds of uncertainty we face. Often we policymakers grapple with uncertainty associated with discrete events. The passage of the\nevent to a great extent resolves the uncertainty. The outcome of the Brexit referendum would be known by June 24. The interpretation of the May employment report would\ncome clear, or clearer, with the arrival of the June employment report on July 8. I would contrast these examples of short-term, self-resolving uncertainty with long-term,\npersistent, chronic uncertainty such as that brought on by the Brexit referendum outcome.\nMeasuring uncertainty is quite difficult, as you would expect. We have some tools, but they are imperfect. There are uncertainty indexes. We also have survey data. At the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, in partnership with the University of Chicago and Stanford University, we conduct large-sample surveys of business leaders to gauge how\nthey assess the risks they face and how these risks inform their decisions. In a post-Brexit survey a few days ago, roughly one-third of the businesses we surveyed indicated\nthat the result of the referendum made their sales outlook more uncertain. They indicated they would be more cautious in hiring and capital spending decisions as a result of\nBrexit. We had a spirited internal discussion of whether one-third is a big number or not-so-big.\nTaking a long view, policymaking may have to adapt to an altered environment. To avoid letting uncertainty become a nebulous rationale for repeated inaction, refinements to\nhow we measure uncertainty and how we gauge its effects are to be encouraged. Economists have useful work under way on the problem. I look forward to more and better\ntools.\nI’ll close with a reminder as much to myself as anyone. FOMC policy decisions are to be grounded in the Committee's statutory monetary policy objectives—maximum\nemployment and price stability. In that regard, it's important to re-emphasize that policy is data-dependent—that the economic performance of Main Street America will be the\narbiter of the appropriate stance of the Fed's monetary policy. For now, I don’t believe the FOMC is behind the curve in the setting of the policy rate. For that reason, I'm\ncomfortable with a cautious and patient approach to policy in the near term.\nSometimes you just have to take some time and let the waters clear.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nFour-and-a-Half Current Questions for Policymakers\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nWorld Affairs Council Jacksonville\nThe River Club\nJacksonville, Florida\nMay 3, 2016\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a May 3, 2016, speech to the World Affairs Council in Jacksonville, discusses the Federal Open Market Committee's\nrecent policy decision and questions he will be considering as the June meeting approaches.\nIn spite of a weak first-quarter U.S. economic growth estimate, Lockhart continues to expect stronger growth over the rest of the year.\nLockhart believes the FOMC is closing in on its full employment objective and sees indications that broad-based inflation is firming.\nIn Lockhart's view, the downside risks from abroad appear to have subsided somewhat.\nLockhart says there is growing concern that the potential rate of economic growth is lower today than it was in the past, which would have implications for the path of\nmonetary policy. He adds that the low rate of labor productivity growth is puzzling.\n_______________________________________________________________\nThank you for that introduction.\nI once read a dictionary cover to cover. I was in a situation of mandatory attendance of classroom lectures on some dull subjects. So I brought a\ndictionary to class and worked my way through it. The instructors—when seeing me peering into my Webster's—thought I was looking up one of the\nwords they'd just used. This was an acceptable lapse of attention, I guess.\nOne of my favorite sections of the dictionary is the A-M-B words—words like ambiguous, ambivalent, ambidextrous, and amblyopic. Amblyopic refers\nto dim vision without obvious visual impairment. An apt word, perhaps. I'm from the Federal Reserve and I'm going to talk tonight about the\neconomy.\nA meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, concluded a week ago. The Committee decided not to increase interest rates.\nThe statement that followed the meeting said that economic activity appears to have slowed even while labor markets continue to improve. The Committee cited slowdowns\nin consumer spending, business fixed investment, and net exports. The housing sector was mentioned as a positive element along with consumer sentiment and growth of\nhousehold real income. The statement noted that inflation continues to run below our 2 percent target for the longer run, and inflation expectations remain stable. Finally, the\nCommittee repeated that it is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments.\nAt the time of the meeting, we did not have in hand the first estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth; that reading of the economy was received last\nThursday morning.\nIn the days running up to the initial GDP growth reading, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracking estimate predicted an annual rate of growth for the quarter in the neighborhood\nof half a percent. That turned out to be pretty close to the Bureau of Economic Analysis's first estimate of 0.5 percent. That's weak growth.\nThe economy is throwing off mixed signals. The data have an ambiguous quality. We have weak first-quarter growth and at the same time strong labor market data and\nindications that inflation is firming. Firming is desirable. We want to see the inflation rate move up toward, and ultimately to, 2 percent.\nThe FOMC's next meeting is in mid-June. For the next few weeks, you can expect to hear lots of discussion and speculation about whether the FOMC will make a second\nincrease in its policy rate. I'm not going to take a position tonight on that question. The policy path will depend on how conditions evolve between now and mid-June.\nRather, I'd like to provide you some insight into how I—one policymaker—am organizing my thinking on the economy and policy considerations at this juncture.\nThere are always many considerations, but I am especially attuned to four—actually four-and-a-half—questions that I feel I must think about as the June meeting\napproaches.\nHere are the four-and-a-half questions in shorthand:\nFirst, domestic economic growth—what's happening? What's the outlook?\nSecond, the FOMC's monetary policy objectives of full employment and stable prices—how close are we to achieving these objectives?\nThird, risks to the baseline outlook—what are the key risks and especially, how much weight to put on global risks?\nFourth, our economy's longer-run potential rate of growth—is it lower than before? Should we lower our expectations for future growth, in part because productivity\ngrowth is low?\nFinally, the half question: labor productivity growth—what should we make of the low trend numbers?\nI need to stress that my remarks this evening are my personal views. I am not speaking for any other Federal Reserve official or for members of the FOMC.\n\n\fGrowth\nAs already mentioned, first-quarter growth appears to have been weak. The disappointing first quarter follows a better, but less-than-stellar, fourth quarter.\nWhen, at the beginning of the year, my team at the Atlanta Fed set our expectations for the first quarter, we knew that some components of economic momentum that\nunderperformed in the second half of last year would likely remain soft. For example, we expected net exports to lag due to the dollar's strength, and we expected business\ninvestment in structures to stay depressed due to the fall in oil prices. It's worth noting that both the dollar and oil prices have reversed somewhat their strong moves over the\nlast two years.\nHousehold spending—also called personal consumption—was soft in the second half of 2015, but we were counting on a rebound of sorts in the new year. The underlying\nfundamentals then appeared and still appear solid. These consumer fundamentals include household balance sheets, house prices, income growth, and low interest rates to\nfinance purchases of homes, cars, and other durable goods.\nTo sum up, we were expecting solid growth of domestic demand fueled by strengthening consumer spending. So far this year, we've been disappointed. Although not a bad\nthing in the end, the savings rate has edged higher. Consumers appear to have banked some of the gasoline dividend. The consumer seems to be behaving cautiously.\nWhat to make of these conditions? Is slow domestic demand likely to be persistent or transient? And are the readings even fully reliable?\nDoubts are legitimate. The first quarter has been anomalous in recent years. In 2010, 2014, and 2015, the first quarter was substantially weaker than the remaining three\nquarters of the year. From 2010 through 2015, the first quarter averaged less than a percent.\nWe could be picking up statistical noise in first-quarter numbers. Some economists believe \"residual seasonality\" could be distorting the numbers. Rough estimates by my\nstaff put the impact of residual seasonality on first-quarter growth anywhere between 1/2 and 1 1/2 percentage points.\nAn alternative interpretation of the data sees first-quarter weakness as just a lull. In other words, normal quarter-to-quarter ups and downs are at work.\nIn spite of the first-quarter estimate, I haven't revised my view that the economy is growing at a moderate pace. For now, I'm sticking with my forecast that growth will be\nstronger over the rest of the year. The fundamentals look solid for consumer activity.\nHow close to objectives?\nAs you may be aware, the FOMC sets monetary policy to achieve two objectives—the so-called dual mandate established by Congress. The two objectives are full\nemployment and low and stable prices.\nThe exact measure of full or maximum employment is debatable. And it's widely accepted that full employment varies from year to year and period to period. Using the\nconventional unemployment number calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, most of my Fed and FOMC colleagues estimate today's full employment at a bit below 5\npercent unemployment. The current rate is fairly close to that.\nI believe we are closing in on our full employment objective, but there is some evidence that unused or underused labor resources remain.\nData on involuntary part-time workers, for example, are a bit elevated compared with pre-recession levels. Perhaps more striking is the recent reversal in labor force\nparticipation. More than 2 million workers have joined the labor force over the past six months. The number of people coming off the sidelines tells me there's a shadow labor\nforce, and it's now feeding employment gains. Monthly payroll jobs growth has averaged 234,000 over the last year and 209,000 over the last three months.\nAs for the inflation objective, the Committee has set the target at 2 percent over the longer run. Inflation readings remain below our target. Some of those readings show a\ngap to target that is not trivial. That said, there are indications that broad-based inflation is firming. This gives me some confidence that the run rate of inflation will rise to 2\npercent over the medium term.\nHere's a key point in assessing the current situation: the tone of reports on our two objectives—the encouraging employment and even inflation data—isn't easily reconciled\nwith the current growth picture. As a policymaker, I've got to form an opinion on which data element is the most reliable signal of economic reality. For the time being, I'm\nfavoring the encouraging employment data over the growth data. Our soundings of business leaders across the Southeast (a process led by our Jacksonville regional\nexecutive, Chris Oakley) are more upbeat than the recent GDP number.\nRisks—domestic and global\nThere are always risks—both downside and upside—around a baseline outlook for the economy.\nIt's an old joke that economists are ambidextrous—\"on the one hand, on the other hand\"—and that only a one-armed economist will give you a straight opinion.\nAs suggested by my earlier commentary on growth, my biggest worry is that a lull turns out, in fact, to be persistent. The motor of the economy is household spending and\nbusiness investment. We could be seeing a downshifting in consumer activity along with continuing and persistent wariness on the part of business as regards capital\nexpenditures.\nFurthermore, in its last three statements following FOMC meetings, the Committee has made a point of acknowledging concern about global financial and economic\ndevelopments. As you will recall, the year began with a period of heightened volatility in financial markets that seemed to be triggered by factors such as the slowing of the\nChinese economy, a sell-off in the Shanghai equities market, stress on commodity-exporting emerging markets, and concerns about diverging monetary policies around the\nworld.\nIn my view, the downside risks from abroad appear to have subsided since January and February. Things have calmed down somewhat.\nLast week's FOMC statement reiterated that the Committee continues to monitor global economic and financial developments. The global watch list includes a number of\nconcerns. I will mention one concern that has some potential to loom large as we approach the June meeting. That is Brexit, as it is called—the referendum in the U.K. on\nwhether to remain in the European Union. Brexit could be a source of heightened global uncertainty.\n\n\fI want to make another important point. As we monitor global factors, what concerns me is the potential effect on our domestic dual-mandate objectives (employment and\ninflation), not the drama of the developments per se.\nPotential\nNow I'd like to shift from relatively short-term economic considerations to a longer-term frame of reference. The last question—or question-and-a half—deals with what may\nbe structural aspects of our country's economic performance. The first question is about the trend rate of potential economic growth—that is, how fast can our economy grow\nover time on average?\nThere is growing concern that this number is simply lower today than it was in the past. Lower potential would have implications for the path of monetary policy. To explain, if\nthe potential rate of growth is lower, it is likely the neutral interest rate is also lower. The neutral rate is the rate at which policy must neither add stimulus nor remove stimulus\nto keep inflation low and employment at maximum. In this state of the world, interest rates would remain low for a long while. Put differently, even as the FOMC normalizes\nthe settings of interest rates, rates would be low by historical standards.\nProductivity\nThere are a number of reasons potential growth could be lower than in the past. I won't go into all the possible causes, but one in particular has become a matter of\nconsiderable concern and puzzlement. That is the low rate of labor productivity growth in recent years. Productivity, or output per hour worked, has averaged a mere 1/2\npercent per year over the past five years.\nTo put that number in perspective, over the 20 years leading up to the Great Recession, U.S. productivity growth averaged 2.2 percent per year. At that rate of productivity\ngrowth, the American standard of living was doubling roughly every 32 years. If the recent trend is the new normal, our standard of living would double in about 140 years.\nWe don't have compelling explanations for the cause of slower productivity growth, but we do have some clues. If we look at what is different these days as compared to the\npre-recession period, a factor that gets one's attention is the decline of what's called \"capital deepening.\"\nPut simply, U.S. firms are deploying net new capital at an unusually slow pace.\nAn implication of the recent trend in productivity is that the U.S. economy is growing almost entirely by pulling more workers into jobs. That's a good thing when the U.S. labor\nforce is underemployed.\nBut if, as I asserted earlier, the economy is nearing full employment, at some point we should begin to see mounting pressure in the labor market. One sign of mounting\npressure would be accelerated wage growth.\nWe have not yet reached that point. Generally speaking, wage growth remains tepid. Broadly based wage growth would be the clearest indication that the ability of the\neconomy to grow by adding workers is reaching its limit.\nClose\nI'll sum up. As the next policy decision point in June approaches, I will be probing three immediate questions while considering one and a half other questions. Are data\nrelative to growth improving, rebounding? How close are we to full employment and 2 percent inflation? What is the risk context? I will weigh answers to these questions\nkeeping in mind the longer-run concerns of slow labor productivity growth and its contribution to what may be lower potential growth. At the moment, the data, overall, are\nambiguous. As a policymaker considering whether to hike interest rates, I'm ambivalent at this point. But I continue to be ambitious for the performance of the U.S. economy\nfor the remainder of the year.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nA Kaleidoscopic Context for Monetary Policy\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRotary Club of Savannah\nHilton Savannah DeSoto\nSavannah, Georgia\nMarch 21, 2016\n\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a March 21, 2016, speech to the Rotary Club of Savannah, discusses the Federal Open Market Committee's\nrecent policy decision and his outlook for 2016.\nLockhart supported the FOMC's March 16 decision to hold rates steady and believes there is sufficient economic momentum to justify a further rate hike at one of\nthe coming meetings.\nLockhart says the U.S. economy is on a track that should produce moderate growth this year, between 2 and 2.5 percent, and the FOMC's inflation objective of 2\npercent is achievable in the medium term.\nIn Lockhart's opinion, the outlook for 2016 and 2017 swings on the question of whether domestic demand will hold up.\nLockhart adds that a longer-term structural factor to consider is the aging population distribution, which will present challenges to achieving vigorous growth in future\nyears. He says the just-released Atlanta Fed's annual report discusses this phenomenon.\nLockhart says that monetary policy remains on a gradual path of rate increases, and decisions will be data-dependent.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nLast week, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's group responsible for setting monetary policy, met and decided to keep\nunchanged the benchmark policy interest rate that influences the rates that businesses and households pay and earn.\nThe statement issued at the conclusion of the meeting characterized an economy that continues to grow at a moderate pace supported to a\nsignificant extent by growth of consumer spending.\nThe statement noted that progress continues on both monetary policy objectives—employment and inflation. Job gains continue to accumulate quite\nsatisfactorily, and some inflation indicators show movement higher in the direction of a healthier rate of inflation.\nDespite continuing economic progress, the Committee cited recent global economic and financial developments as a reason for its decision.\nI supported the Committee's decision. Although I believe further normalization of interest rates will likely be justified by economic performance this year—and possibly\nrelatively soon—I felt a patient approach made sense at this meeting.\nToday I will elaborate on the factors I considered most important in the recent policy decision. Looking ahead, I'll lay out my near-term economic outlook, and I'll comment on\nhow the context of risks and uncertainties around the outlook can affect decision making on policy.\nI will be sharing my personal views, as always. I'm not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nI'll start with my current assessment of economic momentum. I see the economy on a growth track that should produce moderate growth this year—between 2 percent and 2\n1/2 percent.\nThis outcome could be in question if you simply extrapolate from growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. The fourth quarter was relatively weak—currently estimated at 1\npercent. Consumer activity eased off considerably in the fourth quarter. The higher dollar continued to exert a drag on exports. This was felt especially in the manufacturing\nsector.\nAn important question is whether to view the fourth quarter as a one-off aberration or a sign of slowing growth. Since we're still in the first quarter of 2016, it's a little early to\ncome to a definitive conclusion. But we are able to gauge the strength of economic momentum in real time using a method we call a nowcast (as opposed to a forecast). A\nnowcast takes each data point as it comes in and adds it to a model-based computation of the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) on an annual basis. Such a\ncomputation is sometimes called a tracking estimate. The data we have in hand as input to this estimate run through January, with a few data points for February. Our\ntracking estimate for the first quarter is currently 1.9 percent.\nSo I am reasonably confident the first quarter will represent something of a bounceback from the fourth quarter of last year. Consumer activity has picked up sufficiently since\nthe fourth quarter to support the view that overall domestic demand—the lead driver of the economy—is expanding at a healthy enough pace.\nWith a moderate pace of macroeconomic expansion in 2016 should come continued improvement in employment conditions. The headline rate of unemployment stands at\n4.9 percent as of the last report. The employment report for February showed another small uptick of labor force participation, following earlier similar moves beginning last\nfall. I take this as an encouraging sign that potential workers previously out of the labor market are being enticed back into the labor force. Their return suggests that slack\nremains in our economy's utilization of all potential labor resources, but we're getting closer and closer to the objective of full employment.\n\n\fThe FOMC's other policy objective is low and stable inflation. The rate of inflation has been too low for a long time, and the current run rate continues to be measured below\nthe Fed's target of 2 percent. Depending on the measure you use, inflation is running between two-tenths and eight-tenths of a percent below the desirable rate.\nThere have been encouraging aspects of recent inflation reports that suggest inflation may firm as we get to the back half of the year. Measures of inflation that exclude the\ndirect price effects of energy prices and other relatively volatile consumer prices are not far below 2 percent. These data—taken with my assessment that the economy's\ngrowth is still a bit above the longer-run potential rate—make me optimistic that the Committee's inflation objective is achievable in the medium term.\nIn my opinion, the outlook for 2016 and into 2017 swings on the question of whether domestic demand will in fact hold up.\nArrows on the dashboard of domestic demand point in various directions. Business investment remains soft. Investment in inventories rose last year and remains somewhat\nelevated. The need to work off inventories could constrain expansion in the near term. As you know, investment in structures related to oil and gas exploration and production\nhas fallen dramatically. Other forms of business investment reflect a cautious mentality.\nThe economy has drawn its strength instead from domestic consumer activity. A number of factors seem to be underpinning household and consumer spending. Employment\ngains have bolstered confidence in job security, job availability, and prospects for future income. The recovery of house prices has increased household wealth. Household\nbalance sheets are much improved compared to those a few years ago. Low interest rates and available credit continue to enable spending on durable goods.\nShort of some big shock that turns consumer psychoIogy on its head, I see no reason why consumer spending growth should not continue. I think the conditions supporting\nthis engine of economic momentum are likely to hold steady. I should add to the list the so-called \"gasoline dividend.\" Although slower than expected to show through in\nconsumption patterns, lower oil prices and lower gasoline prices should bolster the economy through the consumer channel.\nThe incoming economic data have been, admittedly, mixed since the momentous December meeting of the FOMC (the meeting at which the Committee raised its policy rate\nfor the first time in almost a decade). We policymakers face some ambiguity. In my experience, this is almost always the case. But overall, I see the recent data as positive. I\nbelieve a forecast of sustained moderate growth momentum is realistic and remains the likely scenario. In my opinion, there is sufficient momentum evidenced by the\neconomic data to justify a further step at one of the coming meetings, possibly as early as the meeting scheduled for end of April.\nI have been closely following the commentary in reaction to the Committee's decision and subsequent communication last Wednesday. The decision to keep rates\nunchanged did not surprise financial markets. Financial market participants apparently had concluded that the tone of the incoming economic data, combined with the recent\nfinancial market volatility and signs of global weakness, was enough to dissuade the Committee from following up its December liftoff decision with another rate hike.\nIn contrast, much has been made of the implications of the 17 independent forecasts submitted by Committee participants, taken together. The number of interest-rate\nincreases in 2016 implied by the median forecast drawn from participants' submissions was reduced from the December projection. In past communications, we emphasized\nthat rates would likely rise gradually and, consequently, monetary policy would likely remain quite accommodative for some time. Now it appears the Committee has signaled\nan even more cautious and deliberate approach than that implied in December.\nSo what gives? Well, first, let me reemphasize a message frequently repeated in communications of the Committee. There is no pre-set path of policy decisions. There is no\ndate-specific plan that the public could take as a committed course of action. Decisions to raise rates will be data-dependent. To my way of thinking, this means that at each\ndecision point (each meeting), the Committee will reevaluate whether the real economy—the Main Street economy—remains on the assumed path to full employment and\nprice stability. The Committee will consider information received since the last meeting and what that information implies for the outlook. And, importantly, the Committee will\ntake account of the context of risks and uncertainties surrounding the outlook.\nI would argue that the real economy—the Main Street economy—remains substantially on the path envisioned by Committee participants at the time of the liftoff decision in\nDecember. However, the context of risks and uncertainties has shifted somewhat. In my view, this explains the Committee's changed sentiment regarding the speed of\nnormalization, the pace of rate increases.\nWhat do we know today that we did not and could not take into account in December?\nWe know that in January and early February, the world's financial markets, including our own, went through an episode of significant volatility. From the first trading day of\nJanuary, investors appeared to go \"risk off\" and headed for safety. A number of concerns seemed to gang up on investors: the weak fourth quarter here in the United States,\neconomic weakness globally in advanced economies and emerging markets, the apparent economic slowdown in China, Chinese currency depreciation, and the falling oil\nprice and what that could mean for global demand.\nWe know that an important index that measures financial volatility—the VIX—rose to a level above 28 (a very high reading) on February 11 and has since settled back to a\nmuch calmer reading around 15. We know that financial markets here have substantially recovered lost value, but we do not know if the volatility investors experienced and\nthe public observed in January and early February will have any extended impact on the broad economy.\nWe know that on March 5, the government of China stated its GDP growth target for the next measurement period at a range of 6.5 to 7.0 percent. The introduction of a\nrange was interpreted as allowing for lower growth than recorded in the past, reinforcing the sense that China's economy is slowing.\nWe know that the Bank of Japan—Japan's central bank—unveiled a negative rate policy on January 29. Japan joined the eurozone in using negative official rates to spur\ninflation and growth.\nWe know that on March 10, the European Central Bank deployed Mario Draghi's \"bazooka.\" The ECB pushed its policy rate more into negative territory and took other strong\nmeasures in an attempt to pull the eurozone out of its persistent weak state evidenced by very low inflation.\nThese are some highlights of a rough start to the year. As I said, the context has mutated somewhat since December, even if, all things considered, the economy remains on\na positive trajectory.\nA kaleidoscopic context for policymaking is a fact of life in today's world. Over the past seven years of economic recovery, there have been various points along the way at\nwhich I predicted an acceleration of growth. Too often a headwind or other complicating factor materialized to hold back the economy and undermine my prediction. There\n\n\fwas the European debt crisis that shook confidence. There were intermittent fiscal crises in this country. (Remember the \"fiscal cliff\"?) There were bouts of financial market\nvolatility, and there were weather events.\nHeadwinds pass. They are temporary factors that constrain growth, and in that sense they are part of the medium-term, cyclical story of the economy.\nThere are also longer-term structural factors to consider in forecasting growth. My team of economists at the Atlanta Fed is trying to gain a better understanding of these\nfactors. One such factor is demographics.\nToday we are publishing our 2015 annual report. It will include an essay entitled \"The Graying of the American Economy.\" It explores the economic consequences of an aging\npopulation distribution.\nAs the number of retired seniors expands over the next few decades, the growth rate of the labor force will slow, and the requirements of supporting the non-working\npopulation will accelerate. Other things being equal, slower workforce growth will restrain economic growth. Clearly, the nation faces challenges in achieving vigorous growth\nin the years ahead.\nBut returning to the near-term narrative, let me summarize my main points. The FOMC decided last Wednesday to keep the policy rate unchanged. The economy is trending\npositively, overall. Growth continues at a moderate pace. However, the environment for policy setting has changed enough since mid-December to justify exercising some\npatience as regards the next rate increase. The Committee will be monitoring global and financial developments along with evaluating incoming data. Policy remains on a\ngradual path of rate increases, and decisions will be made based on what the economic data tell us about the likely direction of the economy while taking account of the risk\nand uncertainty context.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • 2015 Annual Report • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

He foresees moderate growth in 2016 at a\npace between 2 and 2.5 percent, along with signs of a tightening labor market and accelerating wage growth.\nThe global economic environment is a downside risk to his outlook, but growing domestic investment could provide a potential upside.\nLockhart expects the economy to enjoy enough self-reinforcing momentum to sustain gradually rising interest rates. Monetary policy decisions are not on a preset\npath and will be data-dependent, he states.\nA key focus for 2016 will be the behavior of inflation. Lockhart expects inflation to begin converging to the FOMC's 2 percent target, but he will look for more hard\nevidence in the data.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nIntroduction\nThis is the ninth time I've addressed this Rotary Club. It's the tradition of this club to have the Atlanta Fed president talk about the year ahead. That\nrequires mustering the courage to make real predictions. That's a heavy responsibility, but I take comfort in the expectation that by this time\ntomorrow, you will be a little vague about what I said.\nYou are probably well aware that something has changed as regards Federal Reserve interest-rate policy. On December 16, after a two-day meeting\nof the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), we announced an increase in the target range for the benchmark policy rate—the federal funds rate\n(fed funds).\nThe action taken at the December meeting ended an era of a policy rate set at essentially zero. The fed funds rate had been at essentially zero for\nseven years, and last month's action marked the first rise in the Fed's policy rate in almost a decade.\nThe decision we took was not a surprise. It was very well signaled. As a result, the financial markets—both domestic and global—absorbed the news without unusual\nvolatility.\nIf you followed the run-up to the FOMC's decision, you know that the financial press and the financial community in general fell into the habit of calling the expected rate rise\n\"liftoff.\" Instead of Cape Canaveral, we have Cape Yellen, I guess. I'm hoping members Hugh Carter and Stan Anderson are here today. Hugh, Stan, we have liftoff. It's done.\nLiftoff has gone well operationally. The FOMC willed that short-term rates go up, and they did. There was some uncertainty associated with the mechanics of the first rate rise\nbecause the Federal Reserve's balance sheet had been greatly expanded by quantitative easing. There is, potentially, a large overhang of tradeable bank reserves in the\nmarket for fed funds, and the demand for fed funds by banks is small. This situation has not turned out to be a problem, and fed funds have been trading comfortably in the\nstipulated range of 25 to 50 basis points.\nThe FOMC's December decision is a small, first step ushering in what I expect to be a new era of normalization.\nToday I want to look ahead. I will give you my current reading of the national economy and the outlook for 2016. I'll comment on the risks around the outlook. I'll give you my\nsense of the outlook for further interest-rate moves, based on what I know today. And I'll discuss the key factors that will influence my thinking about subsequent rate moves\nas the year unfolds.\nSome of you—those amazing perfect-attendance members, at least—have heard my disclaimer eight times before. My remarks today are my personal views. I'm not\nspeaking for the Federal Reserve or the FOMC.\nRecent data/current condition of the economy\nBefore I look into the future, let me summarize the current state of the economy. The economy is growing at a moderate pace—not a spectacular rate of growth, but\nrespectable, just a little shy of the longer-term trend rate of growth per my team's estimation.\nGreater strength is coming from domestic demand than from the external (or export) sector, which is weaker. Domestic momentum has been fueled by growth of consumer\nactivity. In the third quarter of 2015, the annualized rate of growth of consumer activity was 3 percent. That's a solid number. We don't yet have a good reading on the full\nfourth quarter, but we believe it may show a slowdown. We also don't yet have official holiday spending numbers, but early reports suggest some year-over-year growth. All in\nall, the fourth quarter could look rather weak.\n\n\fThere is some good news within the trend of household and personal consumption. Auto sales have been extraordinarily strong. In fact, auto sales have never been better,\nit's fair to say. The annual pace of unit sales of cars, SUVs, and light trucks hit 18.1 million in November and 17.2 million in December. However, according to my auto dealer\ncontacts, they have resorted to discounting and aggressive incentives to sustain the high level of sales. This may have pulled forward future demand.\nThose same auto dealer contacts have cited low gasoline prices as a spur to recent sales. As last year got started, there was much anticipation of the gas price \"dividend,\"\nso to speak. Lower gas prices were expected to translate to a pickup in broad consumer activity. There were signs of this happening in the second half, but some of the\ndividend appears to have gone to savings. The savings rate rose about a half a percent in the second half of last year.\nAs I said, the external sector of the economy is currently weaker than the purely domestic side. Weakness in the manufacturing component of industrial activity reflects softer\nexports due to the higher dollar exchange rate.\nTwo other factors are weighing on the current rate of growth. There is a fall-off of investment in the energy sector—the oil and gas sector—in response to falling oil and gas\nprices. And there has been a slowdown in inventory investment following an accumulation of inventories in the first half of last year.\nOverall, I would say that recent economic data have been mixed, the fourth quarter may be disappointing, but in the same breath I would say mixed data do not undermine\nmy basic forecast.\nOne reason is the strength of employment growth and what that says about overall economic momentum. We got the final 2015 employment report just last Friday. It showed\nDecember (nonfarm) payroll growth of 292,000 jobs. This capped a year in which the monthly average net gain in jobs was a strong 221,000. Close to 2.7 million new jobs\nwere created in 2015, following an even better year in 2014.\nOutlook for 2016\nI'll now get to those predictions. Let me now lay out my outlook for 2016. I have a mildly optimistic outlook for 2016. Mildly, not wildly. I expect the broad economy to continue\nto expand at a moderate pace. To venture an estimate—between 2 and 2.5 percent, possibly a little higher.\nThis rate of growth should be sufficient to maintain positive momentum in employment conditions. Growing employment—in both jobs and hours—adds to aggregate\nhousehold incomes that, in turn, keep consumer activity growing.\nThe hiring trend in our economy has been quite encouraging. The official unemployment rate is 5.0 percent. This statistic doesn't tell the whole story, but we're making\nimpressive progress. There is still a gap to be closed to reach full employment. Over the next year or so, I believe we'll see measures of unemployment and\nunderemployment fall within the range most economists equate with full employment. As you may know, full (or maximum) employment is one of the two congressionally\nmandated objectives of monetary policy.\nAs we move through 2016, I expect to see growing signs of a tightening labor market. Wage growth, for example, should accelerate as labor markets tighten. In fact, our\nbusiness contacts have told us in recent months that it is increasingly difficult to find and retain staff. There is not yet convincing evidence of faster broad-based wage growth,\nbut there were some hints of a pickup in wage growth in the second half of 2015. I expect to see clearer signs of accelerating wages in 2016.\nRisks to outlook\nThere are risks on both sides of the trajectory I've described. In my view, the downside risks relate mostly to the influence of the rest of the world on our economy\nLast week we saw a global selloff in stock markets apparently triggered by data from China that fell short of expectations. The bearish environment was compounded by\ntensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the bomb test claimed by North Korea, and lower oil prices. When such volatility develops, I think it's helpful to look at the real\neconomy of the United States (as opposed to the financial economy) and ask if something is fundamentally wrong. Are there serious imbalances that make the broad\neconomy vulnerable to foreign shocks? I don't see that kind of connection in current circumstances.\nSince the American consumer is central to domestic demand, it's prudent to watch for a shock or development that could cause the consuming public to get very cautious. An\nobvious question is the effect of higher interest rates. I don't expect higher interest rates to snuff out consumer demand. The relatively modest rate increases forecast by\nFOMC participants over the year are premised on continuing economic momentum. I expect that the economy will enjoy enough self-reinforcing momentum to handle\ngradually higher rates.\nThere are also plausible upside risks. The global economic environment could improve. There are tentative signs of quickening recovery in Europe, for example. The positive\nconsumption effects of low oil and gasoline prices have not run their course, in my opinion. Corporations have a lot of cash on the sidelines available for investment. Even\nmodest improvements in the outlook could bring this cash off the sidelines. The economy could snap back faster from a soft fourth quarter if the three factors holding back the\neconomy—global conditions, oil sector investment, and inventory adjustment—dissipate more quickly than expected.\nPolicy outlook\nI expect further rate increases will be justified by economic performance in 2016. In my opinion, expectations for the path of the Fed's interest-rate policy should be grounded\nin these basic points:\nThere is no predetermined schedule of increases, no preset path of policy. No map. Monetary policy is not on autopilot.\nDecisions will be data-dependent. That is to say, the evolution of economic conditions will dictate the timing and, to a lesser extent, magnitude of further rate increases.\nBased on the current consensus outlook of FOMC participants, rate increases will likely come in gradual steps—something less frequent than every meeting.\nI'd like to be more definitive in predicting future rates, but the degree of uncertainty—particularly as regards global influences on our economy—affirms the wisdom, in my\nopinion, of letting the economic data do the talking. This means there is necessarily some tension between clarity of direction and policy optionality. It's not possible to max\nout both. I think the Committee has struck a reasonable balance under the current circumstances.\nKey factor—inflation\nI will be watching a broad spectrum of data this year, but the behavior of inflation will be a key focus.\n\n\fThe FOMC has set a target for inflation at 2 percent over the longer run. We have a specific way of measuring inflation—a particular version of a particular index—but I'll\nspeak in more general terms here.\nInflation has been running well below target for several years, in fact, and just above zero by our preferred measure for the past year or so. Much of the undershoot of the\ninflation target reflects the likely passing influence of the fall in energy prices as well as the dollar's downward pressure on import prices.\nPrice data are a lens that helps us evaluate the performance of the overall economy. Inflation numbers tell us something about overall demand conditions and whether the\neconomy is reaching a notional steady state. Factoring out the transitory influences of oil prices and the dollar exchange rate on the inflation rate, the data suggest there is\nstill a modest shortfall from target.\nA phenomenon as complex as price trends across the complete spectrum of goods and services in our economy is best evaluated using a dashboard approach. Dashboards\ncommonly involve up arrows, down arrows, and sideways arrows to depict the trend of the data. In the case of inflation, think of an up arrow as indicating rising inflation—that\nis, prices rising faster. A down arrow indicates disinflation (the slowing of the rate at which prices are rising) and could also be a warning of deflation (falling prices, broadly).\nA sideways arrow represents a stable reading of inflation, even if below target.\nThe 30 or so inflation data series we track at the Atlanta Fed, taken together, suggest a sideways arrow. Inflation is below where we want it, below what we consider to be\nmost healthy, but the picture is not really worsening.\nThat said, recent measures of inflation expectations hint at some slippage. We care about inflation expectations data because what the public believes about inflation can be\nself-fulfilling. It's important that expectations be anchored at the right level. It's more difficult to achieve an inflation objective of 2 percent over the long haul if people are\nfixated on the wrong number.\nI think the various measures of inflation expectations should be monitored closely this year. I will be watching for any signs of a more definite downshift. As of now, I'm not\noverly alarmed by recent readings. I believe inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored in the neighborhood of our target.\nI'm forecasting inflation readings to start to converge to our 2 percent target in 2016. I supported the FOMC's decision in December to lift off. The Committee had laid out a\ncriterion of having \"reasonable confidence\" that the inflation rate would move to target in the medium term. From my perspective, our satisfaction of the criterion of\n\"reasonable confidence\" was based on projections of the most likely outcome. I will be looking for more hard evidence in the inflation data as the year proceeds.\nSo, to sum up, I am optimistic about the economy's prospects in the new year, but I will be watching the data trends closely. Let me emphasize that the Fed's monetary policy\nis still quite accommodative even with the first rate increase last month and the assumption of subsequent increases in 2016. That will help the economy continue to build\nmomentum.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

Inflation has been below target, but Lockhart believes that\nmuch of what's suppressing inflation is transitory in nature.\nLockhart says that, absent information that drastically changes the economic picture and outlook, the case for liftoff is compelling.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nThanks for having me back at the Broward Workshop.\nThe next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the body that sets monetary policy for the country, is two weeks away. It is a\nmuch-anticipated meeting, and there is a chance it will be historic in character. I say \"historic\" because I expect the Committee to consider, as it has\nin recent meetings, the first increase in the policy interest rate in nearly 10 years. And it's been seven years since the federal funds rate was first set\nat effectively zero. The public has come to know the potential first rate rise as \"liftoff.\"\nI won't predict what the Committee will do. But I can give you my personal views on the considerations involved in such a decision. I have to\nemphasize that you'll hear my personal views. I am not speaking for the FOMC or the Federal Reserve.\nMy views on what's important in a decision to raise rates for the first time in almost a decade parallel the criteria the Committee set out back in\nMarch of this year.\nBy way of background, Congress has directed the Federal Reserve and the FOMC to pursue two principal objectives in formulating monetary policy. They are price stability\nand maximum (or full) employment. This is the so-called \"dual mandate\" under which the FOMC operates.\nBack in March, we established two conditions for a decision to lift off. They are consistent with the dual mandate. We said we want to see \"further improvement\" in labor\nmarket conditions. And we said we want to achieve \"reasonable confidence\" that inflation will firm up and converge to our target of 2 percent in the medium term.\nThe Committee has also emphasized, and has repeated often, that a liftoff decision will be \"data dependent.\" This simply means that we'll be guided by the numbers. That is\nto say, the central consideration will be what the economic data tell us about the state, momentum, and outlook for the national economy, as well as particulars regarding\nemployment conditions and inflation.\nSince I am just two weeks away from having to weigh in and ultimately vote on this important decision, my staff and I are getting close to a last review of the overall picture\nsuggested by the data. I'm approaching this exercise in the spirit of a final accounting. I'm going to walk you through its highlights. As I move through the key data elements,\nI'll provide some commentary on how reliable—in a final accounting sense—I consider the information we have. I judge reliability in terms of how noisy the monthly and even\nquarterly data can be, how subject they are to material revision, and how significant is the standard error around an economic statistic. These tests help me judge how much\nconfidence we can have in the signal quality of incoming data.\nI'll start with the economic top line, so to speak. That is growth of gross domestic product, or GDP.\nReal GDP is estimated to have grown at a 2.1 percent annual pace in the third quarter. Excluding weakness in the export sector as well as inventory reductions, the\ncomponent of GDP called real final domestic demand rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent. This demand growth was largely due to strong consumer spending. I currently\nexpect some slowing in the pace of consumer spending in the fourth quarter, which will dampen overall domestic demand a bit. I base this assessment on the Atlanta Fed's\nreal-time GDP tracking tool, called GDPNow, which processes incoming data on economic activity into an estimate of GDP and its components.\nI would characterize quarterly GDP growth estimates as being of medium reliability. They are subject to frequent, and sometimes sizable, revisions. As another check on the\nGDP growth numbers I just cited, we can look at a second method that calculates gross domestic income, or GDI. In theory, GDI should equal GDP, but that's rarely the case\nin practice. In the third quarter, GDI rose at an annual rate of just over 3 percent. This statistic seems to support the conclusion that the economy is growing at a solid pace in\nspite of ongoing headwinds coming from global conditions and the strong dollar. All things considered, I think a moderate pace of growth should be sustainable.\n\n\fLet me turn now to employment. We have in hand data through October. The October monthly nonfarm payroll growth calculation came in at 271,000. We'll get the\nNovember numbers this coming Friday. Monthly employment data are not terribly reliable. But a run of strong numbers for an extended period of time—like the average gain\nof 234,000 jobs per month we've experienced the past two years—gives me substantial confidence that the employment growth trend is for real.\nThe unemployment rate is perhaps the most important employment statistic in the mind of the public. It improved to 5 percent in October. A broader measure of\nunemployment and underemployment, known as U-6, tracks involuntary part-time workers and potential workers available for work but not currently looking for a job. This\nmeasure hit 9.8 percent in October, more than 7 percentage points lower than its peak in early 2010, and it has fallen a full percentage point since March.\nIn my opinion, the Committee's criterion of \"further improvement in labor markets\" has been met. And further \"further improvement\" is certainly attainable.\nI think the economy is closing in on full employment. As we approach that condition, I would expect to see confirming evidence that labor markets have tightened up. Such\nevidence might come in the form of wage growth. The trend in wage growth has been weak for some time, but it may be picking up. In October, average hourly earnings\nincreased at a 4.4 percent annual rate, well above the postrecession trend of just over 2 percent. But, as I said, a month does not a trend make.\nTo circle back to growth drivers, solid job gains and rising household incomes should contribute to a favorable spending outlook. Growing demand should encourage further\nhiring. I think this dynamic is at work and will continue into 2016.\nI'll complete this high-level review of the data picture with comments on inflation.\nInflation has been below target for much of the recovery, and continues so. A little background: In January 2012, the FOMC set the formal inflation target at 2 percent over\nthe longer run as indicated by the index of personal consumption expenditures (or PCE). In defining price stability, the Committee chose to rely on the overall, or \"headline,\"\nreadings of the index, inclusive of volatile energy and food prices.\nThe price data themselves are fairly reliable. However, the underlying inflation signal can be swamped by a variety of transitory relative price movements. This has been the\ncase recently. Transitory effects of declining oil and gasoline prices and the stronger dollar, along with the weight of remaining slack in the economy, have pushed headline\nPCE inflation close to zero.\nOne way to \"see through\" transitory factors is to use so-called trimmed-mean inflation estimations. These price statistics eliminate the largest monthly price swings—those\nthat often produce noise in the numbers. Trimmed-mean measures have been running much closer to the 2 percent target. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's trimmedmean index, for example, is up 1.7 percent over the past year. Comparing this and like calculations to headline numbers suggests to me that much of what's suppressing\ninflation is transitory in nature. I have bought into that view.\nTo wrap up, I've given you just the highlights of what I can assure you is a comprehensive review of the economic data that my staff and I perform before any FOMC meeting.\nPolicy considerations at the upcoming meeting call for an especially deliberate process. There are two weeks to go, with additional data still to arrive. That said, absent\ninformation that drastically changes the economic picture and outlook, I feel the case for liftoff is compelling.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nOutlook and Policy Views\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nDeKalb Chamber of Commerce\nAtlanta, GA\nNovember 19, 2015\n\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart speaks to the DeKalb Chamber of Commerce in Atlanta on November 19, 2015, about the economy, interest-rate\npolicy, and what he expects in a policy normalization phase.\nLockhart believes some important aspects of the economic picture are weaker than a year ago, energy being a prime example. Inflation has been running below the\nFOMC's longer-run target for a while, but Lockhart expects the gap to close gradually.\nStill, Lockhart believes the national economy is on a reasonably solid trajectory. On balance, the data have been encouraging and affirm the economy is growing at\na moderate pace.\nLockhart is comfortable moving the federal funds rate off zero soon, conditioned on no marked deterioration in economic conditions.\nLockhart expects the trajectory of policy rate rises to be dictated by the evolution of the economy and the balance of risks. There won't be a predetermined path,\nand policy decisions will continue to be data dependent. The normalization phase might look somewhat different than one's sense of normal based on historic\nepisodes of rising rates.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nToday I will offer a few thoughts on the position of the economy, the stance of interest-rate policy, and what I expect in a normalization phase.\nAs always, these will be my personal views and may not reflect those of my colleagues here or other colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nWe are four weeks away from the December meeting of the FOMC. I won't predict the outcome. There are more data points to evaluate over the\nnext four weeks. I will be processing that information to see whether the incoming data change my sense of the health and momentum of the\neconomy—said differently, whether the data broadly support or undermine my base case outlook.\nI believe the national economy is on a reasonably solid trajectory.\nCertainly, there are some important aspects of the economic picture that are weaker than, say, a year ago. The energy sector—both investment and employment—is a prime\nexample. The external sector—captured in the GDP accounting as net exports—is another aspect of the economy that is weaker than in 2014. Domestic manufacturing has\nbeen a bit softer as a result.\nStill, on balance, the data have been encouraging, in my view, and affirm that the economy is growing at a moderate pace. Real final domestic demand data have been quite\nsolid, driven in large part by robust consumer spending.\nSupporting consumer spending, employment conditions are undeniably, in my opinion, much improved relative to even a year ago. We can debate the extent of remaining\nlabor resource slack, but I think the Committee's earlier liftoff criterion of seeing \"further improvement\" has been met.\nThe inflation picture is not so clear, however. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run target for a while. But I expect the gap to close gradually as the\nreduction in resource slack puts upward pressure on prices and the effects of the decline in oil prices and the rise of the dollar exchange rate subside.\nFor me, a key point regarding inflation is that conditions have not been deteriorating, just hanging below target. Consistent with my rather sanguine outlook for inflation,\nsurvey measures of inflation expectations are not signaling imminent broad disinflation, in my view.\nMy overall assessment of the economy and my medium-term outlook have not really changed much over the last year. Before the breakout of heightened financial market\nvolatility in August, I was ready to support liftoff at the September meeting. But I supported the decision to hold off. I thought it was prudent to monitor global developments\nfor a while.\nI also supported the decision at the October meeting to keep the policy rate unchanged because not enough new information had accumulated regarding the drivers of the\nAugust volatility. I'm now reasonably satisfied the situation has settled down—at least as regards the likely causes of market volatility that converged in August.\nSo, I'm comfortable with moving off zero soon, conditioned on no marked deterioration in economic conditions. Given my reading of current conditions and my outlook views,\nI believe it will soon be appropriate to begin a new policy phase.\nThe term \"normalization\" has been used frequently to shape expectations for this post-liftoff phase.\nLet me make a few points about what I expect normalization to look like, given what I know today.\n\n\fI expect the trajectory of policy rate rises to be dictated by the evolution of the economy and the balance of risks, as you would expect. There won't be a pre-determined path,\nin my expectation. As other policymakers have said, policy decisions will continue to be data dependent.\nIn that context, I currently expect the path of policy increases to be relatively gradual or shallow, reflecting a cautious approach to the tightening of financial conditions shaped\nby policy. As a result, the pace of increases may be somewhat slow and possibly more halting than historic episodes of rising rates.\nMoreover, to the extent the evolving economic picture allows a process leading to a \"resting place\" (a neutral or equilibrium rate), that point might be lower than in the past,\nas implied by a somewhat lower trend rate of economic growth.\nI'll sum up by saying I think the normalization phase might look somewhat different than one's sense of normal based on historic episodes of rising rates.\nAs I said earlier, I am offering my personal views here. I will not predict the outcome of the next FOMC meeting. But I will say there are at least three contrary perspectives\nthat could come out in a debate about the timing of the start of normalization.\nFirst, there could be differing views on resource and output gaps. One might hold the view that economic conditions are just not yet close enough to the Committee's\nobjective of full employment.\nSecond, there could be concern that we have seen little or no evidence of inflation moving in the desired direction. This has been called the \"whites of their eyes\"\nperspective. The reference, of course, is to the Revolutionary War officer's command not to shoot until troops could see the whites of the Redcoats' eyes. In this case, the\nidea is not to raise the policy rate until evidence of inflation moving higher is in hand.\nThird, there could be continuing concern about risks associated with global conditions along with the prospect, for example, of further dollar appreciation weighing on\ndomestic activity more than is currently estimated.\nThese are serious concerns. At this point, I don't find them persuasive enough to dissuade me from supporting in the near term a first move to raise rates.\nIn my opinion, the decision to raise the bedrock policy rate, when and if it comes, should be seen as affirming that the economic outlook is positive. I would hope the\nannouncement effect would bolster confidence in our economic future and contribute to the very outcome I've forecasted as the outlook yields to reality.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThe Transition from Extraordinary to \"Normal\"\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nJoint Central Bank Conference\nBern, Switzerland\nNovember 5, 2015\n\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a November 5, 2015, speech at the Joint Central Bank Conference in Bern, Switzerland, discusses the\nfoundational framework that informs his thinking about U.S. monetary policy.\nLockhart describes \"normal\" monetary policy, employed before the financial crisis, in terms of a \"Taylor framework.\" This approach sees policy in terms of rule-like\nbenchmarks that rely on judgments.\nLockhart believes we are transitioning from a period of extraordinary policy—employed during and after the crisis—to normal policy. He feels it is now appropriate to\nbe thinking of the stance of U.S. monetary policy in terms of familiar Taylor framework benchmarks.\nLockhart thinks a case can be made for some adjustment of the federal funds rate target from its current near-zero level. Adjustment thereafter will most\nappropriately be very gradual, he says.\nLockhart notes that liftoff remains a close call. A relatively small adjustment in an estimate of the neutral rate of interest, or revisions in his forecast of how quickly\nremaining output and inflation-target gaps might close, could quite easily point to a longer period for a zero federal funds rate.\nLockhart expects to see a subsiding of the risks that appropriately led to a policy hold in September and October. He thinks the case for liftoff will continue to firm up.\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak tonight. I want to congratulate the organizing committee from the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Canada, the Cleveland Fed, and my\nown Atlanta Fed Research Department for putting on this excellent conference.\nI understand that Thomas Jordan was a founding father of this conference, which started many years ago as a forum to discuss issues of joint interest to our respective\nbanks. I'm sure, Thomas, you are justifiably proud of what you helped establish.\nI take special note of the fact that the collaboration and fellowship between our institutions has spread beyond just this event. At the suggestion of Thomas Moser during this\nconference in Ottawa last year, we hosted Katrin Assenmacher of the Swiss National Bank at the Atlanta Fed. Katrin observed our approach to preparing for meetings of the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. In turn, we will have the opportunity to send a member of my staff to do the same next year in Zurich. These sorts of interactions\nenrich our appreciation for the challenges we face in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.\nWe are just about a week past the latest FOMC meeting. Understandably, the public was focused on what signal the Committee might send about near-term decisions\nregarding the federal funds rate. Going into that meeting, I felt a successful outcome would be expectations aligning with the view that liftoff at our upcoming December\nmeeting is a possibility, but not a certainty. I am satisfied that was accomplished.\nIn my remarks this evening, I would like to shift the focus somewhat away from the \"will they or won't they\" question. Instead, I'm going to talk about the foundational\nframework that informs my thinking about U.S. monetary policy in its next phase. In particular, I'm going to talk about the broader context in which I think about the setting of\nthe federal funds rate target range.\nAs you know, these comments reflect my own opinion. Nothing I say tonight necessarily reflects the thinking of my FOMC colleagues or others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\"Normal\" Monetary Policy and the Taylor Framework\nMy commentary will start with making a distinction between the approach that has informed my thinking through much of the period after the Great Recession and what I will\nrefer to as \"normal\" monetary policy.\nBy \"normal\" monetary policy, I mean decisions that can broadly be described in terms of some variant of a Taylor rule as a benchmark for the policy rate target. I will refer to\nthis orientation as the \"Taylor framework.\"\nI intend to make what could be a quite abstract discussion more concrete and immediate. Toward that end, I'll conclude my remarks with comments on how the framework I\nwill describe relates to my support for the September and October FOMC decisions. I'll also make some tentative comments about the path forward. In doing so, I will\nhighlight the usefulness of the Taylor framework, but will also make note of its limitations.\nLet me make an assertion that I think is relatively uncontroversial. Before the financial crisis, monetary policy could reasonably be described in terms of what I have just\ncalled the \"Taylor framework.\"\nObviously, this is a reference to John Taylor and his famous rule. While Professor Taylor proposed a particular rule back in 1993, I am thinking more generally of a framework.\nMy notion of a Taylor framework does not lead mechanically to a rate setting. Rather, it's an approach that sees policy in terms of rule-like benchmarks. These benchmarks\nrely on judgments about resource-utilization gaps, deviations of inflation from central-bank objectives, and some notion of a \"neutral\" rate of interest. Such a framework, to my\nmind, captures the spirit of the congressional mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.\n\n\fPolicy in the Not-So-Great Recovery\nDuring the financial crisis, recession, and aftermath, the FOMC employed unconventional policy tools. And, with the benefit of hindsight, I think they were necessary. It's fair\nto say that the Great Recession was followed by the Not-So-Great Recovery. A variety of headwinds whipped up by the financial crisis and its aftermath have resulted in a\nhistorically slow and halting recovery in the United States, and indeed in the global economy.\nOne of the basic policy realities of this period, of course, has been a federal funds rate set at what is, in the United States, the effective lower bound. This was unconventional\nby the standards of history.\nAdditional unconventional tools included the three rounds of large-scale asset purchases, popularly known as quantitative easing. QE3, which began in September 2012,\nwas soon supported by explicit forward guidance indicating the FOMC's intention to maintain an exceptionally stimulative policy stance until explicit inflation and\nunemployment thresholds were reached.\nEventually, explicit thresholds were replaced with more general statements about labor market conditions and progress toward the Federal Reserve's inflation objective. But\nforward guidance remained a central tool of monetary policy. It became the sole policy tool when QE3 ended in October 2014.\nIn my view, the essential purpose of forward guidance was to stay the course on maintaining an extraordinarily low setting of the Fed's policy rate for longer than what would\nbe prescribed by \"normal\" monetary policy.1\nOnly when the recovery was firmly entrenched would it be appropriate to transition from an extraordinary, and in some sense emergency, stance of monetary policy to a more\nconventional use of standard benchmarks for setting policy rates.\nAt the end of last year, the statements accompanying the FOMC's rate decisions shifted from an approach that used forward guidance to an approach that has come to be\ndescribed as \"data dependence.\" I supported that shift, and view it as an element of a transition away from the extraordinary policies necessitated by a weak recovery.\nAt this juncture, it's my assessment that the U.S. economy is likely in an above-potential growth phase, with labor markets continuing to improve, and with an underlying\ninflationary trend that, if not rapidly moving toward the FOMC's objective, is at least not moving away from that objective.\nI believe we are transitioning from a period of extraordinary policy to normal policy. That is to say, I believe it is now appropriate to be thinking of the stance of U.S. monetary\npolicy in terms of familiar Taylor framework benchmarks. Let me comment on the state of the three ingredients of a Taylor framework: resource gaps, the inflation-target gap,\nand the \"neutral\" real rate of interest.\nResource Gaps\nThe first key ingredient of Taylor-rule benchmarks is an assessment of resource gaps. Given the Fed's dual mandate, it is appropriate to focus on resource gaps in terms of\nthe labor market.\nThere are a variety of ways to measure labor utilization. Indeed, I prefer a dashboard method of judging the employment gap. The dashboard includes the official\nunemployment rate, the employment-to-population ratio, and a measure recently devised by my staff in Atlanta. We call this the ZPOP ratio.2 The ZPOP ratio is akin to a\nworker satisfaction ratio. It estimates the share of the population that is working the hours they wish.\nZPOP counts people as satisfied with their hours of work if they are employed full-time, they are employed part-time by choice, or, according to their report to the Census\nBureau, they do not want a job.\nThose who say they don't currently want a job are treated as satisfied. In that sense, they are fully utilized, because the chances they will change their status in the near\nfuture tend to be quite low. The largest driver of the overall increase of people in the \"do not want a job\" group has, in recent years, been retirement.\nAs of September, the ZPOP ratio stood at 92 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis. So, by this measure, 8 percent of the working-age population is underutilized. That\nfigure is well below the cyclical peak of 15 percent in early 2010, but is still just above the cyclical trough of 7 percent in late 2006.\nIt is possible that structural changes in labor markets have changed the ZPOP ratio that should be associated with full utilization of labor resources. For instance, there\nprobably have been shifts in employment opportunities for less educated and younger workers toward industries that have larger concentrations of part-time employment.\nThis could indicate that the share of the group working part-time but wanting more hours is going to be a bit higher permanently.\nStill, it's my opinion that most, though not all, labor market slack has been absorbed. The conclusion our ZPOP-based analysis leads to is similar to our estimate of the output\ngap—that it's substantially, but not completely, closed.\nThe Inflation-Target Gap\nThe second ingredient of a Taylor framework is the inflation-target gap.\nA little over a month ago, FOMC Chair Janet Yellen gave an important speech on inflation dynamics and monetary policy. Chair Yellen put forward the view that, despite the\nsignificant shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent target, it's likely that inflation will gradually return to that target as transitory influences fade, resource slack continues to\ndiminish, and inflation expectations remain anchored. I share her view.\nRegarding inflation expectations, stable expectations are a critical underpinning of the case for confidence that the FOMC can meet its inflation objective over a reasonable\nhorizon. On this point, Chair Yellen made note of some puzzles—some contradictory aspects of various measures of private-sector inflation expectations. I'd like to examine\nthese apparent contradictions, applying work we've done at the Atlanta Fed.\nOne of these puzzles relates to divergent signals obtained from different survey measures of inflation expectations. At first glance, different players in the private economy\nhold very different views about future inflation. Two commonly referenced surveys are the Philadelphia Fed's Survey of Professional Forecasters and the University of\nMichigan's Survey of Consumers. With the former, professional forecasters tend to have expectations that are tightly grouped around the observed inflation trend. Meanwhile,\nhousehold surveys reveal a remarkably wide range of opinions about future inflation, and on average run persistently higher than trend inflation.\n\n\fThere is a large body of work that attempts to explain why groups in the economy apparently view inflation so differently.\nIn contrast, work by my staff at the Atlanta Fed indicates that views on inflation may not be as different as the survey data suggest—provided you ask the right question.3\nSince 2011, we have been surveying business executives about costs and prices. Our research shows that most of the differences we observe in survey measures of\ninflation expectations are a result of the questions being asked. For example, we find that when we ask business executives the same question usually put to households—a\nprediction of \"prices in general\"—they respond much the same way that households do. They give a prediction that appears unusually high on average and varies quite a bit\nfrom executive to executive.\nBut when we ask executives to predict a specific inflation measure like core CPI, or Consumer Price Index, inflation—the same question that is asked of forecasters—the\nresponses of the panel of firms are nearly identical to those of professional forecasters.\nTo me, these results highlight the importance of getting the question right. For business executives, who are, after all, the price setters, we ask questions about the costs they\nexpect to face and the prices they expect to charge. We think these are the questions that are meaningful to their businesses. And from these data, we conclude that inflation\nexpectations of business firms look, on average, quite similar to what's reported for professional economists and not much at all like what's reported for households. In other\nwords, expectations appear anchored and reasonably consistent from firm to firm, and near target-appropriate levels.\nA second concern noted in the Yellen speech was the recent softening of expectation measures derived from market-based inflation compensation. These are potentially\nimportant signals because they could represent the inflationary sentiments of parties who actually have money at risk.\nSince June, the five-year breakeven rate, measuring inflation compensation over the next five years, has fallen roughly 55 basis points (as of October 28). This raises the\nquestion of how much of this 55 basis-point decline is due to falling inflation expectations versus other factors.\nMy staff has made an effort to unpack the various components in these market-based break-even rates. Others have done similar work. Our results indicate that factors other\nthan expected inflation, notably market liquidity, can account for almost all the drop in the breakeven rate. Our estimate of investors' underlying CPI inflation expectations\nover the next five years is about 2.1 percent, right in line with the FOMC's objective.4\nOverall, it appears to me that inflation expectations are fairly well anchored.\nThe \"Neutral\" Real Rate of Interest\nThe final piece of the Taylor framework is some measure of a \"neutral\" real rate of interest. In John Taylor's original formulation, this would be the 2 percent real policy rate.\nMore generally, the neutral rate idea is meant to capture the level of the inflation-adjusted policy rate target that is neither stimulative nor restrictive.\nAs you in this audience are aware, there is a large literature on defining and measuring the neutral rate, variously known as \"r-star,\" the \"equilibrium\" rate, or the \"natural\"\nrate. I won't review that literature in any detail, but I will make three observations.\nFirst, by most accounts, the estimated neutral rate has been on a downward trajectory for some time, and is at historically low levels.5 This phenomenon has been estimated\nin other advanced economies as well.\nSecond, I tend to view the historically low levels of the neutral rate as resulting from fundamentals that are beyond the reach of monetary policy. These include population\naging, productivity growth, and the global appetite for saving and investment.\nFinally, it goes without saying that the level of the neutral rate—like all estimates of variables not directly observed—is subject to error and uncertainty. However, based on a\nrange of evidence, I think a neutral rate in the neighborhood of zero is a reasonable estimate.\nA Qualification: Benchmarks, Forecasts, and Risks\nAdding up all of the elements of the Taylor framework as I currently see them, I think a case can be made for some adjustment of the federal funds rate target from its current\nnear-zero level. That said, adjustment thereafter will most appropriately be very gradual, in my opinion.\nThere is a caveat—an important one, I think. The Taylor framework is a benchmark, and a benchmark only. Appropriate policy is forward-looking. The data inputs that drive\npolicy conclusions have meaning for policy not in the moment, but in how they influence projections of future economic conditions and progress toward policymakers' goals.\nA benchmark based on estimates of today's output and inflation-target gaps is informative, but it's only part of the picture.\nAny actual policy decision must take into account a broader array of considerations that cannot be captured by the simple framework I have described. An assessment of\nrisks is a crucial element in sound decision making.\nEarlier this year, I thought economic conditions would evolve in such a way that liftoff could be justified by the time the Committee met in September. The economy did more\nor less evolve in line with the path I expected.\nApplying the Taylor framework alone, liftoff in September was arguably appropriate. But emerging risks—that is, open questions about spillover effects from the slowdown in\nChinese growth and the sudden spike in volatility in global financial markets—called for some delay. For me, it was a close call, but I thought holding off was prudent.\nThen following the September meeting, I came to the view that the period leading to the October FOMC meeting was not long enough to answer all the questions that the\nCommittee faced at the September meeting. Here again, risk management principles in my mind justified some discounting of a liftoff signal that might derive from application\nof the simple Taylor framework.\nI expect to see a subsiding of the risks that appropriately led, in my opinion, to a policy hold in September and October. I think the case for liftoff will continue to firm up.\nLooking Ahead\nThough my assessment of the Taylor framework elements leads me to the view that liftoff will soon be appropriate, I am not concerned that the FOMC is behind the curve.\n\n\fLiftoff remains a close call. A relatively small adjustment in an estimate of the neutral rate, or revisions in my forecast of how quickly remaining output and inflation-target\ngaps might close, could quite easily point to a longer period for a zero funds rate.\nNew risks or uncertainties may well color future decisions in a way that will justify continued deviations from the simple prescriptions of a Taylor framework. But it is apparent\nto me that we are in the midst of transition from an extraordinary period that called for unconventional tools, to a period where we again utilize rule-like benchmarks.\n1\n\nMichael Woodford's presentation at the Kansas City Fed's 2012 Jackson Hole conference provided a timely and important articulation of this idea.

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nAn Economic Narrative\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nSociety of American Business Editors and Writers\nNew York, New York\nOctober 9, 2015\n\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in an October 9, 2015, speech to the Society of American Business Editors and Writers in New York City,\ndiscusses current economic conditions and his outlook.\nLockhart says the domestic economy continues to expand at a moderate pace amid a backdrop of global weakness and elevated market volatility. However, he\nperceives a touch more downside risk today than some weeks ago.\nLockhart notes signs of weakness in net exports and inventories, but real final sales, which factors out inventory movements, is estimated to have expanded at a\nrather robust 3.1 percent annual growth rate in the third quarter.\nThe employment situation, Lockhart says, is nearing levels that many economists associate with full employment. So the economy has come a long way in the\nalmost seven years since the federal funds rate reached the zero bound.\nAs he considers the signal value of incoming data over the next several weeks, Lockhart believes consumer data will be the most telling.\nLockhart believes it is important to keep attention mostly on the Main Street economy. Financial market gyrations should be influential in a monetary policy decision\nonly to the extent they could plausibly affect real activity through pretty clear and understood channels.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has a travel and tourism advisory council involving executives from tourism bureaus, the hospitality\nindustry, and theme park operators. Tourism is an important industry across the Southeast, especially in Florida, as you might expect. I met with\nour advisory council on September 30. I learned that the tourism sector is strong. I also learned that there are experiments under way to marry\nactual roller coaster rides with virtual reality, sometimes called augmented reality. The idea is the rider will strap on a headset that will add to\nand vary the ordinary thrills of the ride. Two people on the same ride can see different things.\nI looked up the names of the top 10 roller coasters in the world. They have names like Escape from Krypton, Tower of Terror, Dragon\nChallenge-Chinese Fireball, and Thunder Dolphin.\nWhere am I going with all this? Nowhere in particular, other than to draw a light metaphor for the experience of the last few weeks in global markets, in U.S. economic data,\nand in Fed watchers' reaction to these developments.\nConsider the odds-making on the timing of liftoff (of the policy rate by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC). The statement that followed the September 16–17\nFOMC meeting was interpreted by some as dovish as regards the timing of liftoff. That statement acknowledged global market volatility as a consideration in the decision to\nkeep the federal funds rate near zero. The statement read, \"Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to\nput further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.\" Subsequent commentary of FOMC participants was interpreted by some as firming up expectations of a decision\nto begin normalization at either the October or December FOMC meeting. Last Friday, we received a jobs report that was interpreted by some as lowering the odds of liftoff in\nOctober or December. The last few weeks have provided a bit of a roller coaster ride.\nI've been experiencing this ride from the vantage point of a member of the FOMC, one who participates in deliberations on the questions that provided the humps and dips of\nthe last month or so. Today I will offer my views on how to assess current economic reality based on recently arriving data. I'll suggest that recent information on the economy\ngives rise to some ambiguity. I'll attempt to put current economic signals in perspective as an aid to dealing with that ambiguity. I must emphasize, as I always do, that my\nremarks this morning will reflect personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee. I'm sure I have colleagues who will\ndisagree with my views.\nRecent incoming data\nI'll start with a summary of what the data are telling me and my staff about the state and momentum of the economy. Overall, I interpret the data to indicate that the domestic\neconomy continues to expand at a moderate pace, though this domestic expansion is occurring amid a backdrop of global weakness and elevated market volatility.\nThis conclusion requires looking through quarter-to-quarter swings. The Atlanta Fed publishes a tracking estimate of quarterly gross domestic product, or GDP, growth. Some\nof you may be familiar with our GDPNow tracker. Our estimate for the third quarter currently has real GDP coming in at a relatively soft 1.1 percent. This follows a strong 3.9\npercent official reading in the second quarter.\nMuch of the weakness we at the Atlanta Fed gauge in third-quarter output is associated with an inventory drawdown. We have inventory effects subtracting 2 percentage\npoints from third-quarter growth.\nA second and related area of weakness in our growth estimate this quarter is net exports. We got a trade report earlier this week. That report revealed a substantial widening\nof the trade deficit. With the arrival of the net exports number, our tracker computed a subtraction from the rate of growth of nearly three-quarters of a percentage point.\nNot surprisingly, the manufacturing sector appears to have been impacted by the strength in the dollar and global headwinds. Manufacturing production has decreased in\nthree of the past four months. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing purchasing managers' index, or PMI, has dropped markedly, hovering just above\nwhat the ISM would call expansionary territory.\n\n\fExports and inventories were evidently a drag on recent growth. There is a way to look through inventory swings. Real final sales—a GDP measure that nets out inventory\nmovements—is estimated to have expanded at a rather robust 3.1 percent annual growth rate in the third quarter. This estimate suggests that demand growth is even a bit\nfirmer than the average over the last four quarters.\nA lot of the final sales momentum can be attributed to the consumer. Growth in real consumption spending appears to have shifted into a higher gear over the past year or\nso, even as consumer sentiment has declined modestly. Consumption growth should continue given relatively solid income growth numbers.\nTurning to employment, September's payroll report was certainly disappointing relative to expectations. In the third quarter, payroll job gains have averaged 167,000 per\nmonth. While this is a step down from the brisker pace of job growth we'd enjoyed over the first half of the year, it is still more than enough to accommodate the trend growth\nin the labor force.\nAs a result, measures of labor underutilization continued to move lower in the third quarter. The headline unemployment rate is now close to my assessment of its normal\nlevel over the longer run. Nonetheless, broader labor utilization measures that factor in the marginally attached and those persons involuntarily working part-time are still a bit\nelevated. This suggests that there is still some slack remaining in labor markets. I believe this remaining slack may at least partially explain why growth in average hourly\nearnings has been hovering around a subdued 2 percent trend. Broadly speaking, employers have not yet needed to increase wages at a faster clip to attract and retain\nemployees. However, our business contacts in the Southeast report wage and salary pressures in selected categories and geographies.\nFinally, the headline inflation run rate is currently close to zero. This is far below the FOMC's objective of 2 percent over the longer run. I accept the view that incoming\ninflation data reflect the transitory influences of falling energy and commodity prices as well as an appreciated dollar. Stripping out energy prices has inflation running at\naround 1.3 percent.\nMy narrative of the economy\nFor the last several months, I have put forward a narrative of the economy that can be summarized as follows: moderate—above-trend—growth, continuing solid jobs gains,\ninflation running below target in the near term, but yielding in the medium term to accelerating price pressures once transitory factors have subsided. I think my narrative has\nheld up pretty well in spite of differences in monthly and quarterly performance. As a policymaker, the question I have to confront at this juncture is whether the recently\narriving data suggest a materially altered outlook. Should recent information cause me to change my working narrative?\nA month ago, prior to the September FOMC meeting, I foresaw solid continuing growth with steady employment gains. The soft August jobs report could have easily been an\nanomalous reading given the volatility in the data. I continued to feel that the soft inflation data could be explained by transitory factors. And I was prepared to dismiss an\ninflation picture that lacked clear evidence of progress toward target. I believed, and still believe, the inflation data will show in due course the desired upward trend toward\ntarget.\nI responded to incoming data at the time by reducing my longer-term projection for growth a little. I accelerated my forecast of achieving U-3 full employment, and kept the\ndate of reaching the 2 percent inflation target at 2017. The basic narrative I had in mind remained unchanged, and that is still the case. I maintain that the broad economy\ncontinues to move ahead at a satisfactory pace. Anecdotal feedback from business contacts in my district supports this view. And as I said, the third-quarter story is centered\nin inventories. We don't have anything to suggest this is a signal of some deep underlying problem. The data point real final sales continues to indicate healthy growth.\nNonetheless, while I have not changed my basic outlook, very recent data have not provided much confirmation that my narrative still holds. I perceive a touch more\ndownside risk today than I saw some weeks ago.\nUpcoming data\nMy staff and I are always paying attention to incoming data, but the ambiguity of the moment reinforces the need to closely watch the vital signs of the economy over the\ncoming weeks to determine if the outlook has changed.\nTo my mind, it's useful to review the upcoming data calendar to consider what the Committee will have as available information at each of the next two meetings.\nFor the October FOMC meeting, we will have last Friday's employment situation report, the already-in-hand final estimate of second-quarter GDP growth, and August PCE\n(or personal consumption expenditures) inflation data. We will also have some new numbers. We'll have September retail sales, industrial production, producer prices, and\nconsumer prices.\nNaturally, we will have more information in preparation for the December FOMC meeting. By early December, we will have the October and November employment numbers,\nalong with revisions for prior months. We will also have the September and October PCE inflation data and both the first and second estimates of third-quarter GDP.\nAs I anticipate the signal value of incoming information over the next couple of weeks to the October meeting and the nine weeks to the December meeting, I think consumer\ndata are likely to be the most telling. The consumer-based dimension of the economy has been robust for several months. By watching and analyzing the consumer numbers\ncarefully, I hope to avoid the trap of letting one or two months' specific data overly influence my outlook for the economy overall.\nThe longer view\nWhen weighing a big decision like liftoff in circumstances like those we face at this juncture, it's also useful, in my view, to step back and consider the longer, cumulative\npicture.\nSince the economy bottomed out in the second quarter of 2009, real economic output is up about 14 percent. Although the pace of growth has been slower than we might\nhave hoped, the economy in aggregate is approaching current potential. That is to say, the output gap has closed substantially, and with that has come levels of\nunemployment and underemployment that are way down from their peak levels in the tail of the recession. The employment situation is nearing levels that many economists\nassociate with full employment. So we have come a long way in the almost seven years since the federal funds rate reached the zero bound and the six-and-a-half-years\nsince the economy hit bottom.\nI continue to feel that cumulative progress is consistent with liftoff relatively soon. In weighing the timing of a liftoff decision, I'm trying to keep the endgame in focus. For me,\nthe endgame is to begin and sustain an orderly process of normalization when the time is right and when the balance of risks gives us confidence we will not be forced to\n\n\freverse course. It's also vital, in my view, to keep attention mostly on the real side—the Main Street economy. Financial market gyrations should be influential in a decision\nonly to the extent they could plausibly affect real activity through pretty clear and understood channels.\nTo wrap up, I believe the economy remains on a satisfactory track, and, speaking for myself, I see a liftoff decision later this year at the October or December FOMC\nmeetings as likely appropriate. However, the data are giving off varied signals, and there is more ambiguity in the current moment than a few weeks ago. In my opinion, the\nsituation calls for especially diligent monitoring of incoming data with particular attention to consumer activity.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

He describes the U.S. economy as performing solidly.\nThe FOMC set out two principal decision criteria for a fed funds rate liftoff: \"further improvement in labor markets\" and achievement of \"reasonable confidence\" that inflation\nwill rise to the targeted rate of 2 percent in the medium term.\nLockhart states that labor markets have improved, but that inflation has not yet achieved the FOMC's target. The inflation rate has hewed closer to 1 1/2 percent over the\neconomic expansion, and has been essentially zero over the past 12 months.\nLockhart believes that the inflation expectations of businesses and consumers remain anchored around 2 percent and that the continuing expansion of the broad economy\nwill play through to the inflation numbers once transitory influences have subsided.\nLockhart is ready for the first policy move on the path to a more normal interest-rate environment and is confident that the phrase \"later this year\" is still operative. He\nanticipates a gradual pace of rate increases.\n_______________________________________________________________\nIt's good to be back at the Buckhead Rotary. I see a number of friends in the audience. That's always a good thing when one's task is to explain the\nFed's monetary policy decisions, particularly just a couple of days after a policy meeting while debate still rages about whether or not we did the right\nthing.\nI'm sure almost everyone in the room is aware of what I'm talking about. The Federal Reserve's vehicle for making monetary policy—the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC or the Committee)—met last Wednesday and Thursday. The Committee decided to keep the policy rate—the\nfederal funds rate—where it has been for almost seven years. That is, at just above zero, effectively as low as possible. The Committee held off a\ndecision to lift off.\nSaid differently, the Committee held off on a decision to begin a process of normalization of the policy rate. Changes in the Fed's policy rate affect\nmany other short-term interest rates and, in turn, longer maturity rates in the economy.\nThe Committee issued a statement just after the meeting ended Thursday. The statement described a domestic economy that is expanding at a moderate pace and making\nsteady progress by most measures. The statement mentioned that underutilization of labor resources is declining. At the same time, the statement noted that inflation\ncontinues to run below our longer-run objective of 2 percent. Importantly, the statement acknowledged recent economic developments abroad and recent volatility in financial\nmarkets. It pointed out the possibility—but not certainty—that these developments could spill over to have some effect on the trajectory of our domestic economy, including\nrealized inflation.\nAlong with this statement, the Committee also issued its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections. Each FOMC participant submits a forecast of key variables—growth,\nunemployment, inflation, the fed funds rate—four times a year. As a group, the five Fed governors and 12 Reserve Bank presidents who make up the FOMC continue to\nproject growth in the range of 2 to 2 1/2 percent annualized over the next two to three years. This is very similar to the pace of growth seen on average over the now six\nyears of economic recovery. The group sees inflation moving in the direction of 2 percent in 2016, arriving reasonably close to target by the end of 2017. The group expects\nsome continuing decline in unemployment. But it's fair to say the current rate of 5.1 percent is close to what many participants would consider full employment, at least by the\nheadline unemployment measure.\nLast week's meeting was clearly an important one, even if the much-discussed liftoff decision did not arrive. Today I want to walk you through my take on the various\nconsiderations that influenced the decision to hold off raising rates. In so doing, I'll share my sense of the current condition of the economy and what to expect going forward.\nI said \"my take\" because, as is always the case, you will hear my personal views. I am not speaking for my colleagues in the Federal Reserve or on the FOMC.\nGlobal economic and financial developments\nLet me start by talking about recent global economic and financial developments, acknowledged in the FOMC's statement as \"on our screen\" as we approached decision\ntime.\nStarting in mid-August, financial markets here and abroad experienced markedly higher volatility. There are a lot of indicators of volatility. A useful one is the VIX, an index\nthat measures implied volatility of traded option contracts on S&P 500 stocks. The VIX measures the U.S. market's expectation of volatility over the next month. It is\nsometimes called the fear index.\nFears of financial market participants apparently rose in mid-August. Although volatility is lower today, as of Friday it had not completely subsided. In my estimation, the spike\nin volatility was in reaction to the confluence of several factors. I will just list them in no particular order. Contributing factors were the drop in Chinese equity share prices and\nthe devaluation of the Chinese currency. We also heard concerns about the apparent slowing of China's economy. And there was the weakness of emerging markets'\neconomic conditions resulting from declining commodity prices and the knock-on effects of a slowing China. Also on the list was the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and its\n\n\fassumed downward pressure on U.S. exports as well as inflation. Additional factors were the renewed decline of oil prices and uncertainty about the Fed's near-term policy\nintentions.\nAs I said, about a month ago, uncertainties loomed larger, market volatility rose, and, from a policymaker's perspective, risks to the domestic economy ratcheted up a little.\nIt's too early to know whether this episode amounts to a bona fide shock to the economy or just a nervous spasm in the markets.\nTaking the China considerations in isolation, I don't anticipate large first-order impacts on U.S. growth. First among first-order impacts would be effects on exports. I don't\nthink weaker demand from China will greatly reduce our export performance. It's possible there will be indirect impacts, perhaps by way of demand for our exports from\nemerging markets or Europe.\nIt's widely expected that lower-cost imports from China and elsewhere will soften inflation. Because of ordering cycles and lags in import cost adjustments, the disinflationary\neffect of cheaper goods from China is hard to know in a specific time frame.\nAt this point, my summary assessment is that the sources of uncertainty that fueled financial market volatility represent a modest risk to our economy, but a risk factor\nnonetheless.\nI want to stress a basic point. Financial market swings per se are not my central concern. The broad Main Street economy is my essential concern. Market volatility can be a\nsymptom of more fundamental ills. And market volatility, if protracted, can be a channel for damping forces on economic activity. It's too early to detect any significant impact\non the real economy, to know whether any or all ofthe factors I cited will evolve into a significant headwind. For that reason, I thought it prudent to wait to evaluate whether\nrecent developments change the outlook. I supported the Committee's decision last week to hold off, and the altered risk picture relative to the economic outlook was\ndecisive in my thinking.\nCurrent state of the economy\nSince, as I stressed, the impact of unexpected developments on the course of the Main Street economy is my central focus as a policymaker, let me now comment on the\nstate of the economy. The data indicate the economy is expanding at a moderate pace. The economy is performing solidly. This view is supported by feedback from our\ncontacts across the Southeast.\nThe weak first quarter was followed by a quite strong second quarter. Our tracking of real-time incoming data in the current quarter suggests a slower third quarter. One\ncause is slower inventory stocking. Looking at final sales—a measure that removes the influence of inventory swings—the underlying demand picture looks much firmer. This\npicture of solid continuing overall demand growth is underpinned by consumption growth, strengthening business investment, and steady growth of residential investment.\nI've been describing GDP (gross domestic product) growth trends at a national economy level. Let me come closer to home with a few comments on the economy here in\nAtlanta.\nThe economy in our metro area has been tracking progress in the national economy with a slight lag. We see this in the data. Employment is growing. Trends in sectors\nimportant to the region are positive—for example, transportation and logistics, tourism and lodging, residential construction, commercial real estate, and business services.\nThe business services sector is a mainstay of the Buckhead community. Atlanta is a recognized center of sophisticated business services with global reach. I consider\nAtlanta's economy to be better balanced, with a more diversified employment base, than before the recession. I'm bullish on Atlanta's economic prospects. Atlanta should\ngrow along with the national economy.\nThe FOMC's decision criteria\nI have a little more to say about the national economy. So, back to 40,000 feet.\nAs many of you are aware, the FOMC has a dual mandate and is required by statute to pursue two objectives in making monetary policy. They are maximum employment\nand price stability.\nAs a decision to lift off—to begin normalizing interest rates—became a more immediate consideration, the Committee set out two principal decision criteria. They were\n\"further improvement in labor markets\" and achievement of \"reasonable confidence\" that inflation will rise to the targeted rate of 2 percent in the medium term. Obviously,\nboth of these requirements derive directly from the FOMC's dual mandate objectives.\nLet me provide my assessment of conditions associated with these two decision criteria.\nFirst, employment: Over the past year, the economy has been adding jobs at a pace averaging 243,000 per month. This is a strong pace of job growth. In August, the\nunemployment rate ticked down 0.2 percentage points to 5.1 percent. This rate of unemployment is now quite close to the level many economists believe to be full\nemployment. That includes Fed economists and my colleagues on the FOMC.\nAn important question for policymaking is how much slack remains in labor markets. I have long held that the most familiar measure of unemployment—what the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics calls U-3—is not a sufficient indicator of the degree of labor resource underutilization in our economy. Broader measures present a more complete picture.\nThat picture incorporates measures of involuntary part-time workers and people who are only marginally attached to the formal labor force. This latter group is made up of\npeople who are not actively looking for work but are available and might go back to work if economic conditions were creating more demand for their labor.\nWhile the growth in jobs and the decline in joblessness have been impressive, I'm not yet convinced we're at full employment. I think some slack remains. At the same time, I\ncontinue to maintain that achieving full employment is not a prerequisite for a liftoff decision. By most measures, we have seen substantial improvement in employment\nconditions, and we can expect that improvement to continue.\nOne way to size up the degree of remaining labor slack is to look at wage growth. Wage growth across the country remains subdued. Admittedly, wage growth is a lagging\nindicator and may be slow to reflect labor market tightness. Nevertheless, the lack of significant wage growth can be taken as a cautionary sign.\nThat said, I think it's worth taking a minute or two to compare what the data are telling us about wage pressures with what my staff and I hear from contacts among major\nemployers in the Southeast. We hear of growing wage pressures for selected job categories. We get the clear impression that hiring challenges are intensifying. Very\n\n\frecently, our sense of rising wage pressures has become more generalized.\nThere are a number of ways employers might experience tightening labor markets before they resort to wholesale wage increases. (Perhaps here you can nod if you're\nexperiencing some of my examples.) They might experience accelerating attrition broadly or in the category of higher-paying jobs. They might have more offers turned down\nbecause of pay. They might have to match outside offers to retain some of their current employees. And they might have to increase hours of part-time workers, triggering\nbenefits, or increase hours of full-time employees, triggering overtime. If we put our minds to work, we could come up with a litany of things that could be classified as wage\npressures. These are just a few examples of evidence that employment conditions may be tightening and wage pressures may be about to accelerate.\nAs one participant in the Committee's process, I am satisfied I can check off the requirement of \"further improvement in labor markets\" as having been adequately met. I am\nnot so comfortable about inflation.\nIn January 2012, the FOMC set an explicit inflation target of 2 percent per annum over the longer run. Before 2012, individual Fed officials often referred to a target of 2\npercent in their speeches and put it in their longer-run projections.\nOver much of the past six years and more of economic expansion, our policies have failed to deliver on the inflation goal of 2 percent annualized. Using our preferred inflation\nindex, the rate of inflation has hewed closer to 1 1/2 percent, and, over the past 12 months, inflation has been essentially zero.\nA material share of the recent shortfall has been tied to falling oil prices. If we remove energy prices, inflation has been around 1 1/4 percent over the past year—still well\nshort of goal.\nI think the recent numbers largely reflect transitory factors—oil, the rising dollar, falling commodity prices. These factors produce relative price changes, and relative price\nchanges occur all the time. Relative price changes are not necessarily symptomatic of broad, fundamental inflation forces, but they do affect the numbers. Gauging the\nunderlying reality of trend inflation has been and continues to be challenging. The inflation picture is likely to remain murky into next year.\nI think the case for checking off the criterion of \"reasonable confidence\" that inflation will converge to the 2 percent target is harder to make than employment. Even so, I have\ngotten comfortable enough on the inflation question to take a first step in one of the coming FOMC meetings in what will likely be an extended process of normalization of the\ninterest-rate environment. My comfort is based on the belief that there are two forces at work that will shape the inflation outcome in the medium term.\nThe first is inflation expectations. I believe inflation expectations of U.S. households and businesses remain anchored around 2 percent. I base this on survey data of\nconsumers and business leaders. This evidence conflicts with recent financial market-based trends in inflation compensation. In the current volatile circumstances in financial\nmarkets, these data are hard to interpret. I am willing to look past these measures for now.\nThe second force is the continuing expansion of the broad economy. I assume that continued absorption of resources associated with ongoing expansion will result in tighter\nlabor and product markets. I expect such fundamentals will play through to the inflation numbers once transitory influences have subsided.\nThe way forward\nIn my vote at the recent FOMC meeting, I put most of the decision weight on prudent risk management around recent and current market volatility. As things settle down, I\nwill be ready for the first policy move on the path to a more normal interest-rate environment. I am confident the much-used phrase \"later this year\" is still operative.\nOnce normalization is under way, I anticipate a gradual pace of rate increases. This stance of policy will be appropriate, in my view, for an economy operating in a weak\nglobal environment, an economy with some amount of slack remaining in labor markets, and an economy trying to shake off disinflationary influences and sustain enough\nmomentum to achieve a healthy rate of inflation over the longer run.\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThe Interplay of Public Pensions and the Broad Economy\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nPublic Pension Funding Forum Speech\nBerkeley, California\nAugust 24, 2015\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in an August 24, 2015, speech to the Public Pension Funding Forum in Berkeley, California, discusses ways that public\npensions and the broad economy interact.\nLockhart says that state and local government spending cuts can become a headwind in a downturn and subsequent recovery, and pension funding gaps can exacerbate\nthis tendency. But he doesn't see the underfunding of public pension funds as a systemic risk.\nLockhart believes the time to address funding gaps is before the next downturn arrives.\nLockhart says that since the recession ended, the U.S. economy has grown at an average annual rate of 2.1 percent. His baseline forecast is for moderate growth with\ncontinuing employment gains and a gradually rising rate of inflation.\nConsistent with the picture of moderate growth, Lockhart expects the normalization of monetary policy—that is, interest rates—to begin sometime this year, and to proceed\ngradually, in an environment of low rates for quite some time.\n\nI want to thank the organizers of the Public Pension Funding Forum for inviting me to address this conference.\nI am not going to assume you are all fully up to speed on the structure of the Federal Reserve System, the role of the Reserve Banks, and the role of\na Reserve Bank president.\nI am one of 12 Reserve Bank presidents. The Reserve Banks have multiple functions. We implement bank regulatory policy. We process incoming\ncash currency from banks and distribute currency to banks. We operate in the payments system as a provider of check clearing and settlement\nservices as well as electronic funds transfer services. We conduct outreach programs with communities in our districts to enhance financial and\neconomic literacy, to research issues affecting low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and to gather anecdotal economic information to better\nunderstand ground-level economic reality.\nEach Reserve Bank has its own economic research department. Our economists conduct research and support the monetary policy role of their bank presidents. All of the\npresidents participate with the Federal Reserve Board governors in Washington in meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). The FOMC sets monetary\npolicy, which is substantially about interest-rate policy. Policy decisions of the FOMC influence the bond market yield curve. Monetary policy also influences the\nmacroeconomy across multiple dimensions such as aggregate demand, growth, employment, and inflation.\nIn my remarks today, I will explore two points of intersection between your world and mine. The first is financial stability and systemic risk. To pose a question, to what extent\nshould pension funding levels, particularly public pension funding, be considered a risk to financial stability—a potential systemic risk?\nThe second point of intersection is macroeconomic performance. What is the interplay between the condition of public pension funds and macroeconomic outcomes?\nMy overall objective today is a rather modest one. I'll just give you a sense of how I'm thinking about the questions I've just laid out.\nBefore I get into it, let me initiate you to the ritual of \"the Fed disclaimer.\" You will hear my personal views only. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the FOMC. My\ncolleagues may not agree with my views. This disclaimer is so regularly invoked in internal conferences that authors of papers and presentation slides don't even spell it out\nany more. We just put \"Fed disclaimer\" at the bottom of their title page or slide, and everyone knows what it conveys.\nFinancial stability and systemic risk\nFollowing the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, Federal Reserve System leaders were keenly aware that there were gaps in our institutional understanding of financial\nmarkets. We acknowledged some \"known unknowns.\"\nThere were four key areas in which we felt we were deficient. They were (1) money market mutual funds, (2) private equity and venture capital, (3) hedge funds, and (4) state\nand local government public finance.\nIn response to the near-death experience of the financial system, the Federal Reserve mobilized research and monitoring efforts to improve our knowledge of these potential\nsources of risk to the financial system and the economy. Teams were organized around each of these four areas. My Reserve Bank—the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta—\njoined with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to form a team for the last area I mentioned, state and local government public finance. The team's primary focus was on\nthe municipal bond market and public pension funds.\nLet me insert here a comment on the notion of systemic risk. There's no official definition, but systemic risk is associated with financial instability, financial panic, runs on\ninstitutions, and contagion facilitated by interconnectedness in the financial world. Episodes of system-wide financial instability may impose severe costs on the broad\neconomy and society.\nThe team's charge was to look at these two aspects of public finance—the municipal bond market and public pension funds—with respect to their relationship to the broader\nfinancial system. We already had many Fed economists studying the role of state and local government as a gross domestic product (GDP) component—that is, the impact\nof state and local government spending and employment on economic performance and growth.\n\n\fIn thinking about risks to financial stability, our economists applied a model with four sequential elements: shock, transmission, amplification, and feedback. Using this\nframework, they overlaid analysis and scenario evaluation on projections of real economy conditions with the aim of addressing questions such as:\nCould an event in the state and local government sector constitute a significant shock transmitted to the financial system, causing significant macroeconomic distress?\nAlternatively, would actions of state and local governments serve to transmit or amplify shocks from elsewhere in the financial system and exacerbate negative spillovers to\nthe Main Street economy?\nAnd, closer to home for you, could events deriving from funding shortfalls and solvency crises of public pension funds play a big role in what amounts to a shock or a\ntransmission mechanism or amplifier of a shock?\nI'll give you, in my own words, my sense of the conclusions that can be drawn from the work done by our team. Public pensions are not likely to be a source of a systemic\nshock. The current state of underfunding of some public pensions is a serious problem, but the problem is long term in nature. By long term I mean two things. I mean over\nthe long term—that is, a situation regarding public pension plans is likely to build gradually and not be prone to random surprises along the way. We will be able to watch the\nproblem develop. It's unlikely a shock will come out of the blue.\nLong term also means in the long term. By this I mean that a coming to a head, a climactic moment, if one comes, is likely to be well into the future.\nIn this conclusion, I'm focusing on public pension funds in isolation. As we've seen recently, there could very well be a financial crisis-like moment at the level of the\nsponsoring government entity. If a pension system's funding declines enough, there is a risk that a state government could at some point find itself in such financial distress\nthat it would be forced to choose between paying bondholders and paying pension beneficiaries.\nIt's my view that such an occurrence is low probability as a single event, and the probability is even lower that a bunching of such occurrences would amount to a significant\nshock triggering contagion in the financial system.\nGoing a little further with this thought process, if a large state were to default on its debt, an episode of financial instability, possibly fueled by contagion, would be more likely\nto follow from headline effects than through the direct exposure of financial institutions. The majority of municipal debt is held directly or indirectly by households, particularly\nhigh-net-worth households. The amplifiers of leverage and complex counterparty relationships that fueled the financial crisis of 2008 are largely not in play in the municipal\nsector.\nRecent headlines about episodes of financial distress in Detroit and Puerto Rico, for example, have not set off contagion affecting the entire municipal asset class. There was\na market reaction, but repricing was consistent with credit fundamentals.\nMy conversations with members of the team working on municipal markets and public pensions leave me pretty sanguine about chances of a system-shaking event. That\nsaid, they were tasked with thinking about extreme scenarios. This was prudent, in my opinion, because we learned from the events of 2008 and 2009 that tail risks do\nsometimes materialize. I think the right posture, therefore, is one of watchful vigilance. Investors fleeing from the entire municipal bond asset class would raise the cost of\ndebt for all state and local issuers. If prolonged, this could constitute a meaningful headwind for the broad economy.\nPublic pensions and macroeconomic outcomes\nPicking up from that last scenario, I'll shift now to reflections on the interplay of public pensions and the broad economy. I'll organize my comments around two directions of\npotential impact. I'll comment first on pensions impacting the economy and then conclude with thoughts on the economy impacting pensions.\nThe first question I want to explore is how pension funding problems might contribute to fiscal challenges that in turn spill over to the general economy. I will address this\nthrough the lens of the challenges created by significant cutbacks in state and local government spending.\nIn the wake of the Great Recession, one persistent issue—call it a headwind—was that even as private-sector employment and investment started to recover, cuts in state\nand local government spending, investment, and employment continued.\nIn particular, I note the large real declines in K–12 education (particularly school construction), highway and bridge repair, and state social programs. It is notable that while\nspending of this sort was falling, contributions to public pensions grew quite a lot. While the primary cause for this retrenchment in state and local spending was the decline in\ntax revenues, it is worth asking whether growing recognition of the extent of underfunding of public pension funds aggravated the belt-tightening experienced at the state and\nlocal government level.\nThis is not to suggest that states shouldn't have placed and shouldn't be placing a priority on funding their pension liabilities. Nor is it to make a judgment about the\ndesirability of lower government spending.\nMy point is that ongoing public-sector spending cuts can represent a headwind to overall demand and complicate efforts aimed at supporting growth to meet the Fed's\nemployment mandate. To the extent that funding issues with public pensions amplify fiscal stress, the longer-run problem of public funding may translate into growth\nchallenges as the economy seeks to heal from periods of economic weakness.\nEconomic growth and pension funding/investments\nI'll conclude by turning the lens in the other direction. I'll comment on how the macroeconomic growth environment can interact with pension funding.\nI would think the macroeconomic outlook is of great interest to you as you set your investment objectives for the coming years, review your allocation, and decide how much\nrisk you must accept.\nLet me frame the topic in this way: it's about the alignment of assumptions about overall investment portfolio returns with realistic assumptions about macroeconomic\nmomentum and trends. Not all investments in portfolios of public pension funds are correlated with broad economic outcomes, but I suspect many are. Forecast assumptions\nregarding GDP growth underpin, to an extent, forecasts of fixed-income portfolio returns and total returns of other asset classes.\nMy outlook for GDP growth (for the medium term, at least) cannot help but be influenced by recent economic history. Since the recession ended in the summer of 2009, the\ndomestic economy has grown at an average annual rate of 2.1 percent. Compared to other post-World War II recoveries, this is slow growth.\n\n\fOver this period, the economy has faced a number of headwinds and shocks. We've pushed through several domestic fiscal showdowns—including one federal government\nshutdown—a tsunami, two major winter weather events, geopolitical tensions, and wide swings of global energy prices. These developments slowed activity, shook\nconfidence, and bred cautious economic behavior on the part of American consumers and businesses. These spells of cautious behavior have contributed to a slow pace of\nrecovery. More recently, the Greek fiscal crisis was unsettling with its potential for a major financial event or worse. Currently, developments such as the appreciation of the\ndollar, the devaluation of the Chinese currency, and the further decline of oil prices are complicating factors in predicting the pace of growth.\nOur baseline forecast at the Atlanta Fed is for moderate growth with continuing employment gains and a gradually rising rate of inflation.\nThe fundamentals underlying this outlook relate to consumer spending, business investment, and the related issues of wage and income growth. I'll comment on the current\nstate of each of these.\nOver the past year, consumer spending has strengthened to a pace consistent with the solid, but unspectacular, pace of growth I just predicted. This spending has been\nsupported by reasonably good aggregate income growth, but it is important to note that aggregate income expansion has come more from employment gains in the\nworkforce than from gains in wage rates paid to workers. Average wage growth has persisted at levels well below the prerecession pace, very likely in part due to subpar\nlabor productivity growth over most of the recovery.\nWeakness in the pace of labor productivity gains has been associated with a relatively tepid pace of business investment. For example, during the past year, business\nspending on equipment has merely matched the lackluster growth of the overall economy.\nI am looking for some improvement in business investment spending other than energy-sector spending on wells and production infrastructure. The lower oil price has\ncaused major cutbacks in that category of investment.\nThe fundamental factors underlying GDP growth are linked. Business investment supports productivity growth. Growth of productivity fuels wage growth. Wage growth\nfosters the acceleration of consumer activity. I'm expecting continuing improvement in all these elements of the growth outlook, but I'm not predicting sharp acceleration in the\nforeseeable future.\nConsistent with this picture, I expect the normalization of monetary policy—that is, interest rates—to begin sometime this year. I expect normalization to proceed gradually,\nthe implication being an environment of rather low rates for quite some time.\nLet me wrap up. I've had the following basic messages for you today. I don't see the underfunding of public pension funds as a systemic risk. Nor do I see state and local\ngovernment fiscal stresses, to which pension underfunding can contribute, plausibly posing systemic-event risk individually or collectively. However, state and local\ngovernment spending cuts can become a headwind in a downturn and subsequent recovery. Pension funding gaps can exacerbate this tendency. Failure to shore up the\nfunding of public pensions when times are relatively good can compound stresses on state and local budgets when economic conditions become more challenging. For the\nsake of the overall economy, the time to address funding gaps is before the next downturn arrives. Finally, in setting your expectations for returns, you may wish to consider\nthe outlook for growth over the medium term. My own outlook foresees moderate growth, but not a breakout to strongly accelerating growth.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nA Story of Economic Progress\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAtlanta Press Club Speech\nAtlanta, Georgia\nAugust 10, 2015\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in an August 10, 2015, speech to the Atlanta Press Club, discusses the economic progress achieved since the Great\nRecession and the anticipated FOMC decision to move the federal funds rate off zero.\nLockhart says that from its peak of 10 percent, the rate of unemployment has fallen to 5.3 percent. However, the average rate of inflation over the six-plus years of\nrecovery has been 1 1/2 percent. He expects to see convincing evidence emerge that inflation is rising to a safer level and approaching the FOMC's 2 percent target.\nLockhart reiterates that the economy has made great gains and is approaching an acceptable normal, and policy should shortly acknowledge this reality. He is prepared to\nsee mixed data, but he thinks the time to begin normalizing monetary conditions is close.\nLockhart stresses that the path of interest-rate increases will likely be gradual and such a stance of policy will be appropriate for some time after liftoff.\n\nI very much appreciate the chance to address the Atlanta Press Club. As members of the fourth estate (and their guests), you certainly understand\nthe qualities of a good story.\nThe daily news story, I'm told, mostly follows the format of who-what-where-when-why. Longer stories—both nonfiction and fiction—make the\ngreatest impression when there is a hero or heroine, when there's a conflict that builds dramatically and with suspense to a climax, and when the\npoint of highest drama is followed by resolution. The French have a great word for that part of the story—dénouement.\nToday I want to begin my remarks by telling the story of the U.S. economy over recent years. We might think of the economy itself as the hero. The\nrecovery from deep recession is the struggle. The impending decision to begin raising interest rates is the climax. And the normalization of monetary\npolicy, along with the further normalization of our economy, is the dénouement.\nIf that seems a tad contrived for this venue and this audience, please indulge me.\nTo put all this in a more conventional framework—one you might expect from a central banker—the story I'll tell is one of how far we've come, economically speaking.\nSpecifically, I'll discuss how far we've come in terms of employment and labor market health. I'll tell the curious story of inflation, a story of less progress. And I'll present my\npersonal forecast of how the story will play out for a couple of years after the point of liftoff, as it's called.\nAs always, you will be hearing my personal views. I don't speak for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC, or the Committee). This must be\nemphasized given the current context of intense interest in what, when, and why the FOMC will decide to do something or not. I'm speaking only for myself.\nHow far we've come\nThe story could begin in the summer of 2009, when the economy emerged from the Great Recession and the long recovery began. However, I prefer to begin the story in\nDecember 2008, when the FOMC completed a rapid, year-long downward march of its policy rate, the federal funds rate.\nThe federal funds rate—the overnight rate for bank-to-bank lending—is the Fed's chief policy rate. Where this rate is set affects other borrowing rates broadly across the\neconomy.\nThe downward march of the policy rate began in September 2007, when the Committee dropped the federal funds rate from 5 1/4 percent to 4 3/4 percent.\nAs the crisis unfolded, the FOMC pushed the rate lower, and it reached zero, effectively, in December 2008. It has been there ever since.\nThe economic conditions that evoked that policy response in 2008 were extraordinary, to say the least. Let me describe the situation of the national economy at that time.\nWhen the Fed's policy rate hit zero in December 2008, the official rate of unemployment had already climbed from a low of 4.4 percent to 7.3 percent and was rising fast. It\nwould peak at 10 percent in less than a year. Between December 2007 and February 2010, U.S. payrolls fell by more than 8.7 million workers.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, real gross domestic product contracted at an annualized rate of 8.2 percent. The economy's performance in that quarter was its worst in 50\nyears. In December 2008, the economy had already been in recession for a year. The recession wouldn't officially end until the following June. When it finally did end, the\ncumulative loss in national output amounted to the greatest contraction in economic activity in the post–World War II era. The recession was extraordinarily deep, and it was\nbroad.\nBy early 2009, a substantial majority of U.S. industries had either stopped hiring or were cutting their workforce. Construction activity and employment entered their deepest\nand most protracted decline since World War II. Industrial production was hard hit, too. In January 2009, for instance, four of five manufacturers and other industrial\nproducers were generating output below levels six months earlier. Retail spending was off more than 10 percent from year-earlier levels. And measures of consumer\nconfidence had fallen to near historic lows. Virtually every region of the nation and every economic sector were under substantial stress.\nLet me contrast this picture of the state of our economy at the end of 2008 and early 2009 with the picture we see today.\n\n\fSince bottoming out in the second quarter of 2009, real economic output is up about 13 percent. Said differently, the economy is 8 1/2 percent larger than its prerecession\npeak. To give a sense of the scale of improvement, the U.S. economy has added activity about equal to the economy of Mexico.\nAlthough the pace of improvement in output has been slower than hoped for, by most measures, real gross domestic product is approaching its full current potential.\nFrom its peak of 10 percent, the rate of unemployment has fallen to 5.3 percent. We received a new employment situation report on Friday. The official unemployment rate\nremains at 5.3 percent. This level of unemployment is just a shade above what some economists think is consistent with full employment. A broader measure of\nunemployment and underemployment—one that includes marginally attached workers and those working part-time involuntarily—continued to fall in July, to 10.4 percent.\nFrom the employment trough, the economy has added more than 12 million jobs.\nConsumer spending is almost 14 percent above its recessionary bottom, and consumer confidence has recently climbed back to near, and by some measures above, precrisis levels.\nTo sum up, the economy has come a long way in the more-than-six-and-a-half years since the federal funds rate hit bottom. The subtext is that the recovery has been slow.\nIt's taken more than six years of recovery to accomplish what I just described. Clearly, this is a rather long story. The recovery has proceeded at an average annual pace of\nexpansion of only 2.1 percent.\nOver this period, the economy has faced a number of headwinds and shocks. We've pushed through several domestic fiscal showdowns, including one federal government\nshutdown, two major winter weather events, geopolitical tensions, and wide swings of global energy prices. Most recently, the Greek and European Union stare-down was\nunsettling with its potential for a major financial event or worse. These developments slowed activity, shook confidence, and bred cautious economic behavior on the part of\nAmerican consumers and businesses. These spells of cautious behavior have contributed to a slow pace of recovery.\nThe curious tale of inflation\nThe expansion over these six years has been sustained by extraordinary policy medicine involving not only ultra-low interest rates but also three episodes of quantitative\neasing, or QE. The Fed undertook these large-scale asset purchase programs to exert even more downward pressure on interest rates. QE3 ended last December in\nrecognition of substantial improvement in the state of the economy.\nOne constant over this period has been the FOMC's focused attention on achievement of our Congress-mandated policy objectives. \"True north\" in the Committee's setting\nof monetary policy is maximum employment and low and stable inflation.\nIn January 2012, the FOMC took the step of defining a formal target rate of inflation. The Committee set the inflation target at an annual rate of 2 percent to be achieved over\nthe longer run. The Committee believes this rate of inflation is most compatible with healthy growth, healthy conditions in the economy, and an adequate cushion against\ndisinflation and eventual deflation.\nThere are many inflation statistics. The Committee chose to apply the headline, or total, rate of inflation according to the index of personal consumption expenditures, an\nindex calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nThe curious thing is that over six years of expansion, inflation has chronically remained well below this target. The average rate of inflation over the six-plus years of recovery\nhas been 1 1/2 percent. Some of this weak price pressure can be explained by temporary influences such as falling oil prices and the appreciating dollar's effect on import\nprices. Oil prices, for instance, have fallen by about 50 percent since last summer and have fallen another 12 percent in the past month alone.\nThose downward pressures on the rate of inflation are not yet entirely behind us. Because of such factors, it has been difficult to discern the true underlying rate of inflation\nand its trend. This analytical challenge continues, and I expect it to persist for a while. But even if we heavily discount the influence of transitory forces on the headline\ninflation trend, inflation has remained low relative to our objective.\nThe plot progresses\nA few months ago, anticipating an eventual change of policy, the Committee set out two qualitative criteria for an initial interest-rate increase. We said we want to see \"further\nimprovement in labor market conditions,\" and we want to be \"reasonably confident\" that the inflation rate will rise over the medium term to 2 percent.\nThe Committee has also repeatedly emphasized that the decision will be data-dependent. This means there is no foreordained date, and the incoming numbers will dictate\nthe timing of the decision. When the Committee is comfortable that these two tests have been met, the policy move will come.\nMy colleagues and I always intensely monitor economic data, and that has especially been the case over recent months. Progress since the first of the year has been quite\nencouraging. As regards labor market conditions, almost one-and-a-half million more jobs have been added to U.S. payrolls since last December. And the national\nunemployment rate has fallen by half a percentage point in the past eight months. After a weak first quarter of 2015, during which the economy barely grew, the economy\nbounced back to some extent in the second quarter to record a solid rate of growth in excess of 2 percent.\nKey to my own thinking on impending policy decisions is the outlook from here. I expect somewhat stronger growth in the second half of the year. I expect the employment\nmarkets to continue to tighten. I expect continuing labor market progress to begin to put upward pressure on wages across the economy. And I expect convincing evidence to\nemerge that inflation is rising to a safer level and approaching our 2 percent target.\nThe story's climax\nThe economy has made great gains and is approaching an acceptable normal. Policy should shortly acknowledge this reality. The Fed took extraordinary policy measures in\nresponse to extraordinary economic conditions. Conditions are no longer extraordinary.\nCompared to earlier in the year, we know a lot more and can shelve some concerns. We appear to be past the most acute concerns of a spillover from Europe. I have more\nconfidence in the resilience of the economy today compared to even a few months ago. I am much less concerned about a reversal of economic fortune. We are getting\ncloser and closer to what feels like a healed state of the economy.\n\n\fFor me, the cumulative evidence of the economy's healing, and the likelihood the economy is on a path to achieving the Fed's mandated objectives, makes me comfortable\nthat the economy can handle a gradually rising interest-rate environment.\nFed Chair Janet Yellen has stated she expects conditions to jell, justifying a start to policy normalization sometime later this year. I agree. I think the point of liftoff is close.\nAs the Committee approaches what I consider a historic decision, I am not expecting the data signals to point uniformly in the same direction. I don't need this. I'm prepared\nto see mixed data. Data are inherently noisy month to month and quarter to quarter. Given the progress made over the recovery and the overall recent tone of the economy, I\nfor one do not intend to let the gyrating needle of monthly data be the decisive factor in decision making.\nThe dénouement\nThis is not to say that the process of policy normalization should be implemented with urgency, requiring a rapid pace of rate increases. Indeed, there are reasons to\napproach normalization with patience and at a deliberate pace. While the economy is a considerable distance from where it was when our zero-interest-rate policy was put in\nplace, we have somewhat further to go.\nThe Committee has provided guidance that the path of interest-rate increases will likely be gradual. I expect such a stance of policy to be appropriate for some time after\nliftoff. This is perhaps the most important message to reinforce today.\nA private-sector economist whose commentary I follow has typecast monetary policy options as aggressively stimulative, stimulative, neutral, restrictive, and aggressively\nrestrictive. I think this is a useful framework. In those terms, policy will likely transition from aggressively stimulative toward merely stimulative.\nLet me recap my main points. Much progress has been achieved since December 2008, when the Fed's policy rate reached zero, and mid-2009, when the recession ended.\nThat progress has been accomplished with the support of extraordinary monetary policy. Current and prospective economic conditions increasingly do not demand the most\naggressive stance of policy. I think the time to begin normalizing monetary conditions is close. Once underway, the process of raising interest rates to more normal,\nsustainable levels will likely be gradual. It has been a long story, sometimes frustratingly so, but one I am increasingly confident will have a happy ending.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nConsumer Outlook: A Linchpin of Growth\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nBaton Rouge Rotary Luncheon\nBaton Rouge, Louisiana\nMay 6, 2015\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a May 6, 2015, speech to the Baton Rouge Rotary Club in Louisiana, discusses the disappointing first-quarter output\ngrowth, his economic outlook, and the anticipated FOMC decision to move the federal funds rate off zero.\nLockhart says that the underlying fundamentals are strong enough to propel the economy along a growth path that delivers a bounce-back in the second quarter followed\nby a resumption of a pace of growth between 2.5 and 3 percent.\nWith a resumption of stronger growth, Lockhart expects to see further progress toward the FOMC's policy objectives: full employment and movement toward a healthier\nrate of inflation of around 2 percent.\nLockhart's confidence that growth will resume rests importantly on evidence of a pickup in consumer spending. Real consumption growth slowed sharply in the first quarter\nafter healthy gains over the second half of last year.\nAs support for growing consumer activity, Lockhart will be looking at the upcoming April employment numbers and over the longer term for direct, confirming evidence that\nconsumer spending is accelerating.\n\nI'm very pleased to be back in Baton Rouge.\nI'll start by setting the scene. The policy of a near-zero federal funds rate has been in place for more than six years. As you know, the federal funds\nrate is the Fed's official policy rate—the rate from which other interest rates are determined by market forces.\nThere is much anticipation of a decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) to move off zero sometime this year. And the Federal\nReserve has been busy with technical preparation for what's being called \"liftoff.\"\nIn its official communication, the FOMC has laid out a framework for making this important decision. There are two key criteria. The Committee is\nlooking for further progress in labor markets, and the Committee wants to be reasonably confident that the rate of inflation will move higher and\nconverge to the target of 2 percent over the medium term. The assessment that these two criteria have been adequately met is data-dependent.\nThat is to say, the Committee will be looking for evidence in incoming economic data. Those of you in the business world know the expression \"cash flow is king.\" Well, for\nus, data are king.\nToday, I would like to walk you through the data from the first quarter, the back story of my baseline outlook for the rest of the year. I normally prefer to think in terms of a\nmedium-term horizon. But because the FOMC will likely soon be considering a major policy change, the incoming data over the coming days, weeks, and near-term months\nmust be intensely watched and carefully interpreted. For policymaking purposes, the relevant timeframe has been foreshortened. I will provide you the key markers that I will\nbe monitoring\nAs always, I will be presenting my personal views. I am not speaking for the FOMC or the Federal Reserve. My colleagues in the Federal Reserve may not agree with my\nviews.\nThe first quarter\nAfter real GDP (gross domestic product) growth readings of a strong 5 percent in the third quarter of last year and 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter, the initial estimate of firstquarter 2015 GDP growth showed a marked deceleration. According to this first estimate, the economy grew at an annual rate of just 0.2 percent. There will be two more\nofficial releases on the first quarter by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, so revisions are possible, but as of now, it appears the quarter was unusually weak.\nEarly estimates of the current quarter's rate of growth are disappointing. I'm not overly concerned, however. Any estimate at this early date is based on just a few data points.\nReadings tend to get more accurate as more data on the current quarter stream in.\nWhile we can't say for sure, it appears that a variety of transitory or non-persistent factors restrained first-quarter growth.\nSevere winter weather was one such factor. My staff has a weather impact model that analyzes temperature patterns. This tool has produced an estimate that the economy\nlost a half percentage point of growth last quarter due to weather.\nAlthough the news, in February particularly, fixed our attention on weather in the Northeast, the temperature for the country as a whole was significantly colder than typical.\nData from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration measure the deviation in temperature from the long-term average. This source shows that seven of nine\ncensus divisions experienced significantly colder-than-normal temperatures in February. So severe weather was widespread.\nWeather effects on the economy are transitory. There were other factors at work in the first quarter. I'll call these transitional factors. These factors may not dissipate quickly\nlike weather influences and may constrain growth beyond a single quarter. In any event, the bite of economic adjustment from these factors was likely felt most strongly in the\nfirst quarter.\nOne such factor was the drop in oil prices, the effects of which are quite apparent to you here in Louisiana, I'm sure. Lower crude oil prices have interrupted momentum in\nenergy-related structures investment. Total investment in business structures, led by the sharp decline in the energy sector, is estimated to have shaved three-fourths of a\n\n\fpercentage point off real GDP growth in the first quarter.\nThe damper on energy-related investment from lower oil prices may persist for a while. Baker Hughes's count of active oil rigs continues to decline. According to the\ncompany's numbers, active rig count has fallen from 813 on March 27 to 679 as of May 1.\nIt should be said that adjustment to lower oil prices goes further than upstream exploration drilling and related investment. As this audience knows well, downstream users of\npetroleum industrial inputs tend to benefit when costs fall. So there will be offsets to the falloff in oil and gas investment as we go forward. In addition, consumer activity is\nexpected to demonstrate gains from lower gasoline prices, but this was not evident in the first quarter.\nA second transitional factor affecting first-quarter growth was an adjustment to the stronger dollar. The dollar has appreciated by roughly 15 percent since mid-2014,\naccording to a common measure of dollar exchange-rate movements. The stronger dollar was likely reflected in a drag on net exports.\nThe GDP component \"net exports\" measures the relative impact on economic activity of exports and imports. Looking at exports in isolation, after solid expansion over the\nprevious three quarters, exports fell sharply in the first quarter. Import growth, while a bit slower than its recent trend, still increased, which widened the trade deficit. In last\nweek's GDP report, weak net exports subtracted 1 1/4 percentage points from first-quarter growth. We just received revised international trade statistics yesterday, and it\nappears that the rise in the trade deficit was even larger than originally thought—perhaps due to the effects of the now-settled port closures on the West Coast. This raises\nthe possibility that first-quarter GDP growth was even slower than originally reported. Looking ahead, I expect net exports to be a modest drag on economic activity over\nmuch of the year.\nIt should be noted, however, that in recent weeks the dollar has stabilized and oil prices have begun to move up a little. These developments, if they stick, could dilute\nsomewhat what would otherwise be drags on the economy in the near term. We shall see.\nMy outlook\nMy lengthy discussion of the first quarter sets up the question of the moment—how much weight should we put on weakness in the first quarter? I am looking through firstquarter weakness. That is to say, I am not taking much of a signal from the first quarter in my forecast of the second quarter and the rest of the year.\nWe've seen this movie before. It's a pattern we've seen over the years of the recovery. Since 2010, the first quarter has averaged 0.6 percent annualized growth while growth\nover the remainder of the year has averaged closer to 3 percent.\nI'm just making an observation. It reminds us there are often weak quarters that turn out to be aberrations.\nI believe the underlying fundamentals are strong enough to propel the economy along a growth path that delivers a bounce-back in the second quarter followed by a\nresumption of a pace of growth between 2.5 and 3 percent.\nThis is certainly consistent with what I hear, on balance, from contacts across the Southeast. Business sentiment seems to be positive and optimistic.\nWith a resumption of stronger growth, I expect to see further progress toward full employment and movement higher toward a healthier rate of inflation around 2 percent.\nThese are the FOMC's ultimate policy objectives. Growth is the vehicle for achieving these objectives.\nAs I assess the possible and necessary contributors to a rebound in the second quarter and thereafter, attention has to fall on consumer spending, in my view. So a critical\nquestion is, how plausible is the assumption that consumer activity will strengthen and support resumption of growth?\nLet me paint the picture as regards consumption. The rate of real consumption growth slowed sharply in the first quarter after healthy gains over the second half of last year.\nMonthly details show a bit of an acceleration in March following a flat reading in February, perhaps because of weather. But taking a little longer view, since last December\nconsumption growth has been rather soft.\nWhat's up with the consumer? It's puzzling. The fundamentals supporting consumption growth seem strong. I consider consumer fundamentals to be real personal income\ngrowth, household wealth, access to credit, and consumer confidence. Consumer confidence is, in turn, highly influenced by the broad employment outlook.\nLet's look at these factors. Growth of real disposable income (income after taxes, inflation-adjusted) jumped in the first quarter, partly because falling gasoline prices brought\na decline in overall consumer prices. And real income is up almost 4 percent over the past year.\nGrowth in aggregate personal income as an economic statistic stems in large part from job gains (more people working) or wage gains (people earning more). With the\nexception of last month, the pace of job gains has been strong for more than a year. I should mention we will get the April report this Friday. Stay tuned.\nAlong with employment gains, accelerating wage growth raises the potential for consumption growth. Over most of the recovery, wage growth, by any measure, has been\nquite sluggish and has trended well below prerecession averages. Recently, we've seen a bit of an acceleration in some measures. Friday's employment report for April will\ninclude average hourly earnings. We'll be looking for confirming evidence of wage growth.\nThe wealth position of households, or household balance sheet strength, also influences consumption patterns. Household balance sheets have improved significantly since\nthe recession. The ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income has risen sharply over the past year alone. Homeowners' equity is at its highest level since\n2007.\nThe willingness and ability of consumers to access credit is another fundamental underpinning consumption. Households were deleveraging in aggregate until late 2013.\nHousehold debt began to grow again in 2014 and accelerated through much of last year, according to data from the New York Fed's credit panel. I take this as a healthy sign.\nAlso, the willingness of banks to lend to consumers has continued to improve over the balance of the recovery. Lending standards have eased even if they are still much\nmore stringent than precrisis levels.\nFinally, consumer sentiment measured in surveys has improved markedly over the past few months. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment has risen 16\npercent since mid-2014. It is now at its highest level since January 2007.\n\n\fPrices of gasoline at the pump affect consumer sentiment. And the recent sharp decline in gasoline prices, which was reflected in the jump in consumer attitudes, should\nhave bolstered spending growth. Instead, we saw a sharp, nearly full-percentage-point increase in the personal savings rate in the first quarter, from 4.6 percent to 5.5\npercent.\nConsumers seem to be behaving cautiously in most categories of spending. Notwithstanding what they say in consumer sentiment surveys, consumers don't yet seem\nconfident enough to increase discretionary spending in bellwether spending categories such as restaurants, movie theaters, and apparel. If there is an exception, it is durable\ngoods, especially autos. Auto sales saw an annualized sales pace of 16.5 million units as of April.\nSo, as I said, the recent consumer behavior is something of a puzzle, and, at the same time, consumption spending is the key factor that will make my forecast of resumed\nsolid growth come true.\nConcluding comments\nLet me sum up. Monitoring of incoming data is normal practice at the Fed. Given the possibility of a major policy decision in the near term, you can be sure we will be\nwatching the data intently and putting great effort into their interpretation.\nThe near-term growth picture has yet to come into focus. There are many considerations that go into assessing economic conditions. No single number, or even a small set\nof numbers, tells the full story. That said, the outlook I've laid out depends heavily on the health of consumer spending. As support for growing consumer activity, I will be\nlooking this Friday to see if job gains resume the robust monthly increases we saw prior to March.\nAnd over the coming weeks and months, I will be looking for direct confirming evidence that consumer spending is accelerating.\nThe FOMC has set out clear criteria for a decision to begin raising interest rates. Those criteria are further progress in the labor market and arrival at a position of reasonable\nconfidence that inflation will move toward the 2 percent target over a medium-term horizon. Central to my own assessment of the sustainability of progress toward these\nobjectives will be my confidence that growth is back on track. And, at this juncture, my confidence that growth will resume rests importantly on evidence that consumer\nspending is picking up.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

But his support for a monetary policy liftoff decision will inevitably be a\njudgment call. Strength in one aspect of the overall economic picture may offset ambiguity in another.\n Lockhart stresses that the process leading to a normalized structure of interest rates will just begin with the liftoff decision.\nThank you. It's a pleasure to be back in Palm Beach. I'd like to thank the Palm Beach Chamber and the Economic Council for hosting me at this\nevent.\nAs a Fed policymaker, I consider it essential to get out and talk to people in my Federal Reserve region to hear how they are currently experiencing\nthe economy.\nAt the same time, when I weigh options for optimal monetary policy and go to Washington to participate in meetings of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), I consider policy from a national perspective only. I don't base my position on policy matters on what is best for the regional\neconomy. However, what I learn about economic developments in the Southeast helps me build my national view.\nThe Sixth Federal Reserve District comprises six states in whole or in part. They are Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and\nTennessee. Florida is the largest state economy among these. The Southeast is expansive geographically and is a large chunk of the U.S. economy. It's over 40 million\npeople and about 13 percent of the country's gross domestic product. If the region were a separate country, its economy would rank as number 9 in the world. It helps our\nwork of gauging national trends that the Southeast economy is sizeable and resembles the national economy in industrial composition and employment distribution.\nThe Atlanta Fed operates from six offices across the region. Our Miami office is one of our largest. The Miami office focuses on South Florida and, particularly, Southeast\nFlorida.\nTo ensure we are gathering information about the performance of the economy as systematically as possible, we have organized something we call our Regional Economic\nInformation Network, or REIN. REIN is made up of business and community contacts in a variety of fields and includes firms and institutions of all sizes.\nOur economic information network in this part of Florida is overseen by our regional executive in Miami, Karen Gilmore. Karen, like me, is not a Fed career employee. She\nwas a banker in South Florida for many years and brings valuable Main Street experience and knowledge to the Fed. We are teaching her how to talk like a central banker in\nFedspeak. She's making appreciable progress commensurate with the extent of her temporal commitment thus far in her new capacity.\nAs someone who sits at the FOMC table, I can assure you that real-time economic intelligence about what's happening on Main Street is a big part of our discussions. I\nwould like to thank those of you here who have shared your insights on business conditions with Karen. For potential new partners in this audience, if she calls, I'd be very\ngrateful if you'd take the call.\nToday, I'll give you the opportunity to stand in my shoes as a Fed policymaker. I'll try to give you a good feel for a policymaker's considerations and thought processes as the\nFOMC approaches an important decision. The decision, of course, is whether and when to raise interest rates. I'm going to share my assessment of current national\neconomic conditions. I will provide my views on the outlook for the economy and what the economic picture suggests as the appropriate path for monetary policy.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee has laid down two criteria to be met before we begin to raise interest rates. They are further progress in labor markets and reasonable\nconfidence that inflation will rise to the longer-run target of 2 percent. The FOMC has also emphasized that the decision will be data-dependent. I consider this an essential\ndiscipline around our decision making on this matter. To me, data dependency means there is no preconceived plan. Data dependency means the decision will be based on\nthe best evidence we have of the reality and trajectory of the economy.\nI always must begin with a disclaimer. I will be presenting my personal views. I am not speaking for the FOMC or the Federal Reserve. My Federal Reserve colleagues may\nnot agree with my views.\nState of the economy\nI'll start by presenting the economic picture as I see it. Assessment of the performance of the economy requires at least three lens apertures to capture relevant timeframes.\nThe economy, in real terms, has made considerable progress over the past five years. Since mid-2009, real gross domestic product, or GDP, has grown by more than 13\npercent. The unemployment rate has fallen from its peak of 10 percent to 5.5 percent in the latest reading.\n\n\fThe pace of improvement picked up steam over the past couple of years. The official unemployment rate, for example, is now only ½ percent above my estimate of the\nlonger-run natural rate of unemployment—in concept, the lowest level of unemployment before job market slack is absorbed and inflation pressures begin to emerge.\nSubstantial progress has been achieved, and I believe the economy now has sustainable momentum, yet data available for the first quarter of this year have been notably\nweak. Most current tracking estimates of real GDP growth in the first quarter are in the neighborhood of an annual rate of only 1 percent. The Atlanta Fed's tracking estimate\nis considerably below 1 percent. A tracking estimate updates a key economic measure as each new data element arrives. A tracking estimate is a preliminary number. We\nare still receiving data on the first quarter, so we're still computing first-quarter tracking estimates.\nI'm sure many of you took note of the falloff in March payroll job growth reported early this month. The payroll jobs number came in at 126,000, well below the previous\nmonth. Importantly, there were downward revisions to the previous two months' numbers. The report for March brought the employment picture down to earth. Whether\ntemporary or persistent, the pace of decline in the rate of unemployment, and the pace of growth of payroll employment, slowed somewhat. The apparent weakness of the\nfirst quarter can be partially explained, I believe, by transitory factors. Bad weather in February was a drag on economic activity. There was some inventory drawdown\nfollowing inventory accumulation in earlier periods.\nConsumer spending in the first quarter was not as strong as expected. We did not see an expected boost to consumer spending coming from lower gasoline prices at the\npump. At the same time, drilling activity in the energy sector predictably fell off in reaction to the drop in crude oil prices. As the year proceeds, I see consumer activity\noffsetting lower investment and employment in oil exploration and development.\nOne other unexpected factor appears to have weighed on activity in the first quarter, and that is the effect of the higher dollar on exports. Net exports—that is, the contribution\nto economic growth after imports are netted against exports—has fallen apparently as a result of the stronger dollar. Manufacturing activity has felt the pressure.\nManufacturing growth numbers have softened considerably relative to a year ago.\nTo summarize, some factors at work in recent months were clearly transitory in nature, and some other factors have triggered rapid adjustment in certain sectors of the\neconomy. Together, they are giving rise to heightened uncertainty about the track the economy is on.\nInflation\nIn addition, the ongoing picture for inflation adds to uncertainty about the path of the economy. You can think of inflation pressures as symptomatic of demand conditions\nacross the economy. Or, saying the same thing in a different way, inflation pressures or the lack thereof may reflect the degree of slack remaining in product, service, and\nemployment markets.\nIn January 2012, the FOMC set an inflation target of 2 percent over the longer run. There are many measures of inflation. Technically, the FOMC defined its target using a\nparticular index—the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index—and chose the so-called headline version of the PCE index. In headline inflation statistics, the\nrelatively volatile food and energy components are included.\nBy this measure and others, the inflation trends over the last few years have been disappointingly sluggish. The problem we face as policymakers is getting inflation up to\ntarget, and for quite some time this has been difficult. Annual inflation numbers have come in below 2 percent for each of the past two years. This has been the case in spite\nof some quarters of growth well above the estimated longer-run trend rate of growth. And this has been the case in spite of what I believe to be an acceleration in growth\nsince mid-year 2013. It's a bit of a puzzle.\nRecent inflation readings continue to be soft, and the price data for the first quarter were especially weak. On a 12-month basis, headline inflation in February was up a\nmeager 0.3 percent. Core inflation—which excludes the recently falling gasoline component—was up 1.4 percent for the 12 months through February.\nI also look at shorter-term measures of inflation to get a sense of the current run rate. For the three months ending in February, core inflation was up only 0.9 percent.\nEven factoring out the effects of lower gasoline prices on consumer price inflation and the appreciation of the dollar on import prices, the behavior of inflation poses an issue.\nTo repeat, the FOMC has stated that to get comfortable about making the first move to raise interest rates, the Committee participants collectively need to be reasonably\nconfident that inflation will trend higher.\nMy economic outlook\nIt is axiomatic that monetary policy has its effect with long and variable lags. Monetary policy is therefore forward-looking. For that reason, my colleagues and I always have a\nworking forecast in place on which to make judgments about appropriate policy.\nIn spite of the recent weakness, I do not believe the economy in some fundamental way is faltering, stalling, slowing—pick your description. I expect something of a replay of\n2014—a weak first quarter due to transitory causes followed by a pickup in growth in later quarters. My outlook for the remainder of the year is for further progress toward full\nemployment with inflation gradually firming. I have the run rate of GDP growth resuming a pace between 2 1/2 and 3 percent per annum. But this forecast leans heavily on\nthe assumption that recent weakness is a passing phenomenon. The evidence on which to make this forecast is not yet \"in the numbers.\"\nOver the coming weeks and months, I will be monitoring the incoming data closely and carefully for validation of my outlook assumptions. A murky economic picture is not an\nideal circumstance for making a major policy decision. The decision to begin raising rates will be a Committee decision, of course. The decision will represent the consensus\nthat emerges from a wide-ranging discussion that I know will include a range of interpretations of the picture presented by the data as well as different weightings of risks and\npriorities.\nBy laying down the marker of data dependency, the Committee has set limits regarding what is relevant. The state of and outlook for the broad economy will be central.\nAs I see it, data-derived judgments on the timing of the liftoff decision can be based on tests of increasing stringency. I think the bar can be set at three levels.\nThree tests or bars\nThe lowest bar is that key indicators of labor market progress and, especially, the inflation trend are at least stable—that is to say, not moving in the wrong direction. To\nexplain, this test would be satisfied, in my opinion, if unemployment and underemployment numbers are not backing up. Core inflation measures would not be softening. This\n\n\flevel of evaluation might call for evidence that core inflation measures are headed back to levels that prevailed before the oil price and dollar exchange-rate shocks. This\nrequirement might also look for evidence confirming that the first-quarter weakness was an aberration. Some of the current uncertainty ought to have been dispelled.\nThe second bar would be set a little higher. The second test is that indirect evidence supports a favorable outlook for both continuing employment progress and especially the\nfirming of price data. To explain, I think some amount of comfort about prospects for rising inflation can be based on the strength of GDP growth indicators, the trend in\npayroll job creation, and the acceleration of wage pressures.\nThe highest bar would be, as you would expect, the most exacting. It is direct, affirmative evidence in the data that the desired outcomes are in fact materializing. This test\nwould call for a falling unemployment rate and rising inflation.\nIn a timeframe of a few months, I don't place equal probability on satisfying all three tests. I expect it will take longer for direct, affirmative evidence to appear that would\nvalidate a decision to begin raising rates. Falling unemployment and rising inflation may be unlikely in the very near term. In my working forecast, inflation does not pick up\nuntil the second half of the year.\nI'll state my preferences or leanings. Ideally, I'd like to see direct, affirmative evidence in the data that the desired outcomes are in fact materializing. But I can get comfortable\nwith less. I prefer at least some indirect evidence that progress toward our objectives is likely to continue. To get to \"reasonable confidence\" about inflation, sufficient\nevidence could show up in growth numbers, employment numbers, and rising wages as an indication of tightening conditions.\nMy support for a liftoff decision will inevitably be a judgment call. I don't think it is advisable to approach such a decision with rigid quantitative triggers in mind. Strength in\none aspect of the overall economic picture may offset ambiguity in another.\nThe post-liftoff path of policy\nOnce the initial decision to raise rates is made, attention will shift to the subsequent path of policy. The process leading to a normalized structure of interest rates will just\nbegin with the liftoff decision. This is a crucial point. Our policymaking is oriented to achieving the best outcomes in the broad economy. I see the interests of the Main Street\neconomy as more aligned with an approach that thinks of liftoff and subsequent rate moves as a package.\nTo my way of thinking, the data-dependency basis for a decision to lift off and anticipation of follow-on increases of the policy rate are connected. The less an initial decision\nto raise rates is based on concrete, unambiguous evidence of labor market progress and inflation convergence to target, the less that first move should bring an expectation\nof a rapid-fire string of subsequent increases. The more solid the data evidence underpinning liftoff, the more predictable the subsequent rate path can be, in my opinion.\nI think waiting a while longer improves the chances of seeing confirmation from incoming data that the economy is on the desired path. I think it is highly desirable that the\npublic sees an economic picture at the time of the liftoff decision that is consistent with the decision criteria the FOMC has set out. Ideally, coherence between data and\ndecision would be clear to all.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThoughts on Prudential Regulation of Financial Firms\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nGeorgia Law Review symposium\nFinancial Regulation: Reflections and Projections\nThe University of Georgia\nAthens, Georgia\nMarch 20, 2015\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a March 20 speech at the Georgia Law Review symposium at the University of Georgia in Athens, presents his views\non prudential regulation of financial firms. He contrasts prudential regulation of banks and shadow banks, or the firms that play a role in the shadow banking system.\nLockhart notes that the structure of the U.S. banking system is distinctive compared to other advanced countries. Our financial system has resulted in a large, growing, and\nopaque shadow banking system, and the money market fund industry has received particular attention.\nLockhart says that following the financial crisis of 2008, the concept of prudential regulation broadened to encompass \"macroprudential supervision\" to protect the financial\nsystem's ability to support the general economy. This, he says, should be the \"true north\" of any expansion of the regulatory overlay on shadow banking.\nLockhart calls for selective supervision and regulation of banking and shadow banking firms. The onus falls on regulatory policymakers to identify and respond to\ndevelopments that threaten the general economy.\n\nThank you for including me in this symposium on financial regulation. This is an important topic. Having spent most of my career in the private-sector\nfinancial world, I am a believer in the notion of regulatory balance. Our system of financial regulation neither should tolerate practices and risk-taking\nthat imperil public welfare, nor should it strangle innovation, initiative, and sound risk-taking under a mountain of compliance requirements. The exact\nright balance is, realistically, a moving target that is responsive to financial system structure and evolving circumstances.\nToday I would like to explore questions related to prudential regulation as it applies to banks and nonbank financial firms. More specifically, I'll\ncontrast prudential regulation of banks and so-called shadow banks, or firms that play a role in the shadow banking system. Banks are increasingly\nin competition with parties in the shadow banking system. I'll explore the logic of differential regulation between banks and shadow banks. I'll also\ncomment on differential supervision within the banking industry per se.\nMy talk today anticipates a conference sponsored by the Atlanta Fed week after next titled \"Central Banking in the Shadows: Monetary Policy and\nFinancial Stability Post-Crisis.\" As the title suggests, we will be looking at how shadow banking interacts with monetary policy and affects financial stability. Since I expect to\nlearn a lot at this conference, please take my comments today as work-in-process thoughts preliminary to the discussion that will take place at that conference.\nAlso, as always, I have to begin with a disclaimer. I will be presenting my personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or for my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\nPrudential regulation\nLet me start with a few contextual observations on prudential regulation—that is, regulation focused on the safety and soundness of individual institutions.\nPrudential regulation of banks in the decades leading up to the financial crisis of 2008 had, as a central aim, the protection of insured consumer deposits. This was especially\nthe case for smaller banks. The charge to regulators was multifaceted, to be sure, but careful stewardship of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—the FDIC—\ninsurance fund was central.\nThe aims of prudential regulation of larger banks were broader. A substantial proportion of large bank funding came from less stable wholesale funding markets. Also, if and\nwhen these institutions faced distress, the regulators' safety net extended to nonbank subsidiaries. This became reality in the crisis.\nThe crisis also showed that the regulatory safety net might be used to address threats to financial stability associated with firms that were previously exempt from prudential\nregulation. These were firms with no real reliance on consumer deposits, but they were tightly integrated with vital money markets. Regulatory interventions in the crisis\nbrought home the reality that substantial moral hazard accompanied exposure to such firms.\nI would argue that since the crisis, there is enhanced clarity around the broad aims of prudential regulation. The concept of prudential regulations has been broadened to\nencompass \"macroprudential supervision.\" The main goal of macroprudential supervision is to regulate banks—and, increasingly, some important nonbanks—to protect the\nfinancial system's ability to deliver vital services to the general economy. One could say, with little exaggeration, the goal is to protect Main Street from Wall Street.\nBanks have long been among the more heavily regulated firms. However, post-crisis, regulatory oversight has been taken to another level for all sizes of banks. Minimum\ncapital requirements are higher for all banks. Supervisors are requiring more and better internal risk management. Larger banks must now subject their portfolios to annual\nstress tests that assume severe recessionary conditions. They must demonstrate an ability to absorb losses and continue lending to support the broad economy. Their capital\nplans must pass regulatory approval both quantitatively and qualitatively. New regulations on liquidity are now being implemented to strengthen the ability of larger banks to\nwithstand deposit runs. There's more, but I think the point is clear enough. Banks are now even more heavily regulated.\nShadow banking\nIt has to be noted, though, that in the United States, banks represent only a part of the financial system. The structure of the U.S. financial industry is distinctive by\ncomparison with other advanced countries. The financial systems of most countries—and I include those in Europe as a region—are bank-centric. The evolution of our\nfinancial system, by comparison, has resulted in a shadow banking system of considerable scale and institutional diversity.\n\n\fA perfect definition of shadow banking is elusive. A simple and workable definition is financial services providers and credit intermediaries that operate without a bank charter.\nThe Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, uses a similar definition. It is \"credit intermediation involving entities and\nactivities outside the regular banking system.\" The key term in both definitions is \"credit intermediaries.\" Credit isn't the only financial service provided by banks and\nnonbanks, but lending is an essential function in the economy. Credit is the lubricant of economic activity and one of the principal channels through which monetary policy\nhas its effect.\nThe scale of shadow banking activity is large. The most reliable numbers focus on system liabilities. Shadow banking, as measured by liabilities, grew rapidly in the decade\nprior to the crisis. According to a 2013 report on shadow banking by the New York Fed, shadow liabilities peaked at $22 trillion in June 2007 and exceeded the liabilities of\ntraditional banks. More recently, by December 2013, traditional banks had the larger share. A crude estimate would have banks at 60 percent and shadow banks at 40\npercent of credit intermediation.\nA wide variety of financial firms could be classified as shadow banks in part or all of their activity. The list includes money market mutual funds, broker–dealers, nonbank\nfinance companies, business development corporations, hedge funds, pension funds to the extent they participate directly in financings, and so-called peer-to-peer online\nlending platforms. I would add the various functionally specialized participants in the securitization industry.\nSome of these types of intermediary deserve special mention. Broker–dealers, many of which are units of bank holding companies, fund themselves independently of their\nassociated banks in short-term funding capital markets and lend to investors against their clients' inventory of securities.\nParticipants in the securitization industry—the biggest component of which is home mortgages—have a share of shadow banking. In securitization, there is a chain of linked\nroles starting with loan origination, followed by warehousing, leading to structuring an asset-backed security or a collateralized debt obligation that is distributed in the capital\nmarkets.\nAnother component of the shadow banking system that has received a lot of attention is the money market mutual fund industry. Money market funds have drawn attention\nbecause of the aggregate scale of the industry and the quasi-deposit nature of shareholder investments in these funds.\nThe concern in the regulatory community—including the Fed—regarding money market funds relates to the industry's size and perceived vulnerability to runs in times of\nfinancial turbulence. Current regulation of money market funds by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allows only a very limited range of investments and tenors.\nThere is considerable correlation among constituent funds that results from this tight regulation.\nThe industry has about $2.7 trillion of liabilities. Almost 40 percent of that is in funds that hold only government and government agency securities. And almost two-thirds of\nthe $2.7 trillion in invested assets represents investments by institutional clients.\nThere is some basis for concern about the industry's potential role in an episode of financial instability. In the fall of 2008, a prime fund—the Reserve Primary Fund—\"broke\nthe buck\" due to holdings of Lehman Brothers commercial paper. In the week or so that followed, roughly $500 billion flowed out of prime money market funds into\ngovernment money funds. Prime funds met redemptions through decreases in commercial paper holdings, prompting a crisis in that market for issuers. The Federal Reserve\nquickly stood up market support facilities to address the crisis in short-term markets.\nThe money market fund sector remains a focus of regulators because of its potential to be both contributor to and victim of financial instability.\nThe banks' \"franchise\"\nToday, banks and nonbanks compete head-on to a great extent as credit intermediaries and in some other product markets. Put differently, the banking system and shadow\nbanking system go after similar business and serve similar functions.\nThe banking system no longer enjoys anything resembling an exclusive \"franchise\" in its three key functions: deposit taking, payments, and lending.\nAs regards deposits, consumers and businesses have many deposit or deposit-equivalent options. They include money market accounts of various investment styles,\ninterest-paying surplus balances on credit cards, and prepaid cards for various uses. I have a friend whose spouse keeps a substantial credit balance on her Starbucks\npayment card.\nIn payments, too, banks no longer have exclusivity. They no longer have end-to-end control of processing. Banks retain a virtual monopoly in final clearing and settling of\npayments, but now there are legions of financial transaction specialists doing payments processing. Some of these are relative newcomers—so-called fin tech startups—\nwhile others are well established. PayPal was founded in 1998!\nAs I said, the lending franchise of banks is also under pressure. Some nonbank competitors have substantial balance sheets. An example is GE Capital, the seventh largest\ndomestic financial institution. Recently, we've seen the rise of online lending platforms that use powerful credit scoring and decision-making algorithms. The market share of\nthese alternative lenders is small compared to banks. It's too early to assess their ultimate impact on the lending industry, but it's possible that these new nonbank lenders will\nbecome important players in some markets previously dominated by banks.\nI would argue that the coexistence of bank and nonbank credit providers benefits the overall economy. Not all credit extension is appropriately bank business. I once worked\nfor a nonbank finance company. We took lending risk for variable upside, performance-dependent reward where risk and loan structure was outside the appetite and\ncompetence of many banks. The risk transformation accomplished by securitization is analogous. Exposures that are individually outside the comfort zone of banks are\nbundled to create a portfolio with reduced default risk.\nNonetheless, banking and shadow banking are direct competitors along many dimensions. But most nonbanks are much less regulated than banks, and that regulation is\nlargely not prudential in character (that is, safety- and soundness-oriented).\nAside from the obvious question of whether this constitutes a level competitive playing field, is this good macroprudential policy? Furthermore, why are banks subject to more\nextensive regulation? And, given the experience of the recent crisis, is the relatively light regulation of shadow banks still sufficient?\n\n\fDifferential regulation\nBanks enjoy access to two important government programs that are designed to reduce the chances of economically damaging runs. They are the FDIC deposit insurance\nand the Fed's discount window—the central bank's lender-of-last-resort function. For the privilege of these two forms of support, banks submit to a process of regulation and\nsupervision. Banks are not immunized from survival risk. The regulatory regime permits orderly bank failures and prompt resolution under procedures designed to safeguard\nthe broader health of the economy.\nIf there is a case for greater prudential regulation of shadow banking institutions, it is also based on financial stability concerns. These institutions are a significant and\ngrowing source of credit in the economy. They depend greatly on wholesale funding. Many are opaque compared to banks in terms of their activities and exposures. They are\npart of an interconnected financial system that, in extreme circumstances, is prone to contagion. And shadow banking parties are not walled off from the banking system.\nThey share some credit exposures with banks, and they receive funding or support for their security issuance from banks.\nHeightened regulatory requirements have recently been imposed on some nonbanks, but the norm remains differential regulation. After the crisis, a few of the country's most\nsignificant nonbank financial firms—firms that did not own commercial banks—were pulled under the Fed's regulatory umbrella. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became\nbank holding companies subject to bank prudential regulation of the Federal Reserve. GE Capital has been designated a systemically important financial institution (SIFI), as\nhave some large insurers.\nIs market discipline sufficient?\nResistance to expanded regulatory oversight is often grounded in the view that market discipline is an effective substitute. Is market discipline sufficient to address risks\nresiding in the shadow banking world, risks that could have systemic impact? Some comfort can be taken from the reality that liabilities of the shadow banking system come\npredominantly from professionally managed money sources. Also, the spread of firms and activities classified as shadow banks or shadow banking may mitigate the risk of\nmassive concentrations of risk. That said, shadow banking activity is large, growing, and opaque. The financial crisis that began in 2007 arguably began in the shadow\nbanking arena. It propagated to banks and became global because investors and depositors could not assess their counterparties' exposures.\nAt a minimum, I feel the authorities responsible for preserving financial stability must monitor the sector very closely with ever-improving techniques. A robust regime of\nmonitoring is justified, in my opinion, because of the natural tendency in our economic system for activity to migrate to where it is least regulated. I also do not believe we\nhave to choose between complete exemption from prudential regulation and a wholesale extension of the existing framework of regulation developed for banks.\nIf we anchor calibration of regulatory oversight of firms, classes of firms, and markets in potential risk to the broad economy, then it seems to me we should variably monitor\nand supervise institutions and activities in the banking system that may have financial stability implications, and do the same in the shadow banking world. This does not\nmean we should undertake full-spectrum prudential supervision and regulation of everything in either sector.\nSelective supervision and regulation is both possible and desirable. The onus falls on regulatory policymakers to identify and respond to developments that threaten the\ngeneral economy. Too much regulation can threaten the vibrancy of the U.S. economy—although, to be sober about it, not as catastrophically as too little.\nThe concept of differential supervision also is applicable among banks of varying size, scope, and complexity. The Federal Reserve is implementing differentiated supervision\nof individual banks based on a bank's size, complexity, risk profile, and systemic importance. We're calling this approach two-tiered regulation. The approach recognizes\nsignificant distinctions between larger banks and community banks. I expect continuing refinement of supervisory methods along this line.\nThe true north of shadow banking regulation\nThe current orientation of prudential regulation reflects learnings from the recent financial crisis. We learned about concentrations of risk across firms that may not be\nidentified as excessive in individual firms. We learned about interconnectivity within the financial system and the threat of contagion in periods of financial stress. We learned\nabout the role of opaque firms, markets, and vehicle structures, and how they can contribute to cascading illiquidity and market shutdown. At the beginning of my remarks, I\nargued that the experience of recent years has made the primary aim of prudential regulation to protect the financial system's ability to support the general economy. In my\nview, this should be the \"true north\" of any expansion of the regulatory overlay on shadow banking.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nConsiderations on the Path to Policy Normalization\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nSouthwest Florida Business Leaders Luncheon\nHilton Naples\nNaples, Florida\nFebruary 6, 2015\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a February 6, 2015, speech to the Southwest Florida Business Leaders, shares his thoughts on the monetary policy\n\"liftoff\" decision ahead.\nLockhart says the linchpin in a decision to make a significant policy change is confidence in the economic forecast.\nLockhart's baseline outlook for 2015 and 2016 assumes growth at around 3 percent per annum.\nIn Lockhart's view, this outlook, combined with the improvement of economic conditions to date, indicates the economy is on a path to a satisfactory and desirable state of\nhealth.\nLockhart says that the weakness of inflation and wages is a concern, and that firming of inflation readings will give him confidence that the outlook on which monetary\npolicy decisions will swing remains realistic.\nFrom a Main Street perspective, Lockhart says, the important point for business planning is that monetary policy is likely to shift sometime this year, and that decision\nshould be a signal that the FOMC is confident that the economy is on track to achieve its objectives.\n\nI want to begin by expressing thanks to Gary Tice for his service on the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Miami board. Gary follows Gay Rebel\nThompson from this community, who earlier served as a board member and chair of the Atlanta Fed's board for South Florida.\nThis year—2015—is widely expected to be the year the Federal Reserve initiates normalization of monetary policy. This prospect has generated a\nlot of interest and buzz.\nIf you follow the Fed-watching industry, as I do, you are well aware that a top-of-mind question regarding policy is: At what meeting will the Fed\ndecide to lift off? At what meeting will the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raise the policy rate target above its current near-zero range?\nIf you are an investor in fixed-income or interest-paying assets, a lot of money may ride on the precise answer to that question.\nIn contrast, if you are a business person operating in the nonfinancial real economy, you may be less concerned about the precise timing of the first policy adjustment. You\nare likely to be more concerned about what a change in the interest-rate environment means for the outlook for overall demand conditions and the general direction of the\neconomy.\nToday I will orient my remarks mostly to the concerns of Main Street. This keeps the focus where, in my opinion, it ultimately should be—that is, on the health, resilience, and\nmomentum of the broad economy.\nWith this perspective in mind, I want to share my thought process, as one policymaker, on the decisions ahead and the economic context in which they may be made.\nWhen a Reserve Bank president speaks publicly, he or she is expressing individual views, not an official message of the Fed or the FOMC. That is the case today. My\ncolleagues may not agree with my views.\nEconomic progress and outlook\nThe national economy has improved greatly from the recession's trough in 2009. Much has been accomplished.\nThe Great Recession was a particularly severe episode. The economy lost quite a lot of ground. We lost nearly 7 million jobs—more jobs than in the prior three recessions\ncombined. During the recovery, we have regained that ground, and nonfarm payroll jobs are now about 2 million jobs above where they were at the onset of the recession.\nIn terms of total output, the economy is now almost 14 percent larger than at its nadir at the bottom of the recession.\nIt has taken a while—the recovery is five-and-a-half years old—and the job is not finished, in my opinion. But, as I said, much has been accomplished.\nI believe the economy has sufficient traction for the expansion to be extended through the medium term.\nMy baseline outlook for 2015 and 2016 assumes growth at around 3 percent per annum. I expect employment to continue to grow and both unemployment and\nunderemployment to continue to decline. This morning, we received the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment situation report for January. Payroll jobs grew by 257,000 on\nnet. And over the past three months, job gains have averaged 336,000.\nAs a general statement, the improvement of economic conditions to date, in combination with the outlook I just outlined, leads me to the view that the economy is on a path to\na satisfactory and desirable state of health.\n\n\fThe Fed's statutory objectives contained in the so-called dual mandate help define what is satisfactory and desirable. Our policy objectives are maximum employment and\nlow and stable inflation. The Committee has put a clear definition on the inflation objective. The Committee has defined it as a rate of 2 percent annual inflation over the\nlonger run as measured by a particular index called the personal consumption expenditures price index. Importantly, inflation is targeted on a total or headline basis including\nthe highly variable components of food and energy prices. In practice, most Fed officials monitor a collection of inflation indicators in an attempt to discern the underlying\ntrend. There are worrisome aspects of the current inflation picture, and reading underlying trends is problematic at present. Hold that thought. I'll emphasize the centrality of\ninflation concerns a little later.\nMaximum, or full, employment is less explicitly defined. Most economists assume that what constitutes full employment changes over time. Structural shifts in the economy\ncause the natural rate of unemployment to move around. For a good part of the recovery period, a number of Fed policymakers, me included, have estimated the\nunemployment level consistent with full employment as between 5 1/4 and 5 1/2 percent or a little higher. Today's report has the headline unemployment rate at 5.7 percent.\nSo, on that basis, we would seem to be approaching an acceptable steady-state level of employment.\nIt's a fair question, then, why the FOMC has not already started to normalize interest-rate policy. My answer is the recovery has been sluggish for much of its five-and-a-half\nyears. To accomplish what we have, the recovery has required the support of extraordinary policy measures—measures such as a policy rate set effectively at zero and three\nrounds of quantitative easing. Furthermore, the economy has endured periodic headwinds that threatened to dilute or reverse progress. And although the economy is\ngrowing, its strength has sometimes seemed tentative and fragile.\nA moment ago, I said the job is not finished. Some gaps remain.\nEmployment progress, for instance, may be less than meets the eye. Many of us have held that the conventional measure of unemployment probably overstates actual\nprogress. There are still almost 7 million workers counted as employed who say they are working part-time involuntarily. As a point of reference, 7 million is about 4 1/2\npercent of a labor force of 157 million. There are always people in this involuntary part-time category, but the number is still elevated compared to historical levels. Over the\nlast few years, there has been a worrisome outflow of prime-age workers—especially men—from the labor force. I believe some of these people will be enticed back into\nformal work arrangements if the economy improves further.\nThe distance between current conditions and our goals doesn't have to be completely closed for the FOMC to start moving interest rates higher. Monetary policy is, of\nnecessity, forward looking. If, as we look forward, it seems likely we will achieve our policy objectives, then we can consider beginning to adjust policy.\nFrom a Main Street perspective, it is the overall direction and extent of normalization that should matter most, rather than the exact date of liftoff. Liftoff will be a momentous\nevent when it happens, but it is the evolution of the interest-rate environment over the next few years that will most influence real business activity.\nConfidence as linchpin\nThe linchpin in a decision to make a significant policy change is confidence. By that, I mean confidence in a forecast—an outlook narrative, if you will—that has the economy\non track to achieve the FOMC's policy objectives in a reasonable timeframe. I think a reasonable time horizon is one to two years.\nI really want to emphasize this point. The Committee has repeatedly stressed that the first and subsequent policy moves will be data-dependent. It is confidence based on\nclear evidence in the data that will trigger the start of normalization.\nOne hundred percent confidence is never attainable. The test is one of sufficiency—that is, sufficient confidence that, in a defined period of time, the broad economy will\nreach conditions consistent with sustainable full employment and stable prices.\nAt this particular moment, I don't quite have sufficient confidence. There are factors at work at the moment whose effects I consider to be transient. Key among these factors\nis inflation.\nInflation, by almost every measure, has been running considerably below the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This was the case well before the recent drop in energy prices.\nBecause of the sharp falloff of energy prices—especially gasoline prices—headline or total inflation has gone negative in the most recent readings. Core inflation—the\nmeasure that excludes the direct impact of energy and food prices—has recently been running below 1 percent.\nIn my baseline forecast, I have inflation getting past this period of broad disinflation and resuming a gradual rise to 2 percent. It's important, in my opinion, to be confident that\nthis will occur, and certainly that the trend in overall prices is not continuing to move away from the FOMC's target.\nJust as current readings of inflation give some pause, broad wage trends seem to suggest we are not yet on the cusp of full employment. The quite modest growth of wages\nacross the economy does not seem normal given the solid growth numbers we've seen in recent quarters.\nInflation and wages ought to be telling indicators that the gaps are closing. Their weakness is a concern.\nA noisy first half\nThe first half of 2015 will present challenges in evaluating the validity of economic assumptions.\nI've mentioned oil prices. After seven months of decline, prices firmed in trading sessions last week, then fell again. Financial market participants interpreted the firming as a\npositive development. A number of oil and gas sector analysts forecast that global petroleum supplies will exceed demand through the first half of the year.\nThe dollar has appreciated by 13 percent on a trade-weighted basis since last June. Exports in the fourth quarter seem to have been negatively affected by the dollar's rise. I\nwill avoid predicting exchange rates, but suffice to say that the impact of the dollar on exports, as well as imported consumer goods prices, is part of the current swirl of\nvariables making the state of the economy harder to assess.\nThe direction of the dollar is an aspect of the larger context of slow global growth with risk of spillover to the U.S. economy. Some of the influence of soft economic conditions\nabroad is incorporated into my baseline outlook. In contrast, more extreme scenarios are not.\n\n\fI should also comment on inflation compensation in inflation-protected securities. Compensation for inflation in these securities (so-called TIPS) has moved sharply lower\nsince last summer. This decline may reflect transitory influences like falling energy costs. A less benign possibility is that investors are lowering their outlook for inflation. This\ncould be either because their confidence is waning that the Fed will achieve its 2 percent inflation target, or because they see growing risks to the continued strength of the\nbroad economy.\nSince mid-January, some inflation-compensation measures have shown signs of reversing. A firming in the inflation compensation data from their year-end lows is an\nexample of the kind of encouraging development that will bolster my confidence in the medium-term outlook.\nTo put an exclamation point on the proviso that the first half of 2015 may be noisy and hard to read, I'll just catalog a few of the obvious things that might confuse true\nunderlying conditions: oil prices, the dollar, the effects of both oil prices and exchange rates on headline inflation, their possible impact on core inflation, slow-to-improve\nwages, the ups and downs of quarter-to-quarter growth, and mixed messages from measures of inflation expectations.\nWhat am I looking for?\nSo, if the linchpin in a policy decision, for me, is confidence, what am I looking for?\nFor starters, as I said earlier, key indicators of economic conditions should not be moving away from my basic outlook. Assuming no substantial softening of GDP and\nemployment growth, my attention will likely be on the path of inflation.\nI'd like to see some evidence that what we believe to be transient factors driving recent weak inflation readings are, in fact, passing. I would like to see firming of inflation\nreadings. This will give me confidence that the outlook on which important decisions will swing remains realistic and likely to play out.\nInflation is appropriately a focal point because its firming will reduce concerns that the economy is somehow stalling, that prophesies of long-term stagnation have any basis,\nand that chances of accomplishing the FOMC's policy goals are receding.\nAs of today, I remain comfortable with the assumption that circumstances will come together around mid-year, or a little later, that will deliver sufficient confidence to begin\nnormalization with the liftoff decision. I won't be more definitive than that. I think all possibilities from June on should remain open. I don't at this juncture have a prediction or\npreference. Timing will depend on what the data tell us.\nFrom a Main Street perspective, the important point for business planning is that monetary policy is likely to shift sometime this year, and a higher interest-rate environment\nwill ensue. The decision to begin normalization should be a signal that the FOMC is confident the economy is on track to achieve its objectives and that the economy should\nhave sufficient strength and momentum to handle higher rates. The start of the process of normalization should itself instill confidence on Main Street.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nA Potentially Momentous Year for Policy\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRotary Club of Atlanta\nLoudermilk Center\nAtlanta, Georgia\nJanuary 12, 2015\nKey points\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a January 12 speech at the Rotary Club of Atlanta, reviews the growing strength of the economy, the economic outlook\nfor the year ahead, and the monetary policy outlook.\nLockhart stresses that the policy \"liftoff\" decision will be data-dependent.\nLockhart expects the annual rate of GDP growth for the second half of the year to be around 4 percent, which is strong growth.\nAnother reason for optimism, says Lockhart, is that there was more improvement in labor markets in 2014 than in any other year of the recovery. He thinks the momentum\nevident in the second half of 2014 will carry over into 2015, and the ongoing outlook will remain solid.\nLockhart feels the Fed is nearing the end of its job as defined by the extraordinary circumstances of the financial crisis and deep recession. He is looking for a new phase\nof policy to commence in 2015.\n\nAs I look back on 2014 and look ahead to 2015, I can comfortably assert that, more and more, the U.S. economy is hitting on all cylinders. The\nrecovery that began in 2009 is well-advanced, and we are getting closer to a point where the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the\nbody that formulates monetary policy, can begin a process of normalizing the interest-rate environment. That process will begin with so-called\n\"liftoff\"—that is, the first increase in the policy rate.\nChair Yellen, speaking for the Committee, has stressed that the liftoff decision will be data-dependent. That means we will be closely monitoring\nevidence of the performance of the economy as the year proceeds, and we will be assessing what the stream of economic data seem to indicate\nregarding the outlook.\nSo, today I want to present my forecast of how this potentially momentous year is likely to play out. I'll do this in terms of both the vital economic\nsigns and policy. I want to give you a sense of what factors could materially change—even derail—that scenario. And I want to convey a sense of the\nbasis on which important policy decisions ahead will be made.\nThis is my eighth annual address to this club. As always, you will be hearing my personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC. My\ncolleagues may not agree with what I have to say.\nCurrent state of economy and outlook\nSo let's start with the current economic situation. I'll do a short-form version of this focused on three key elements of economic performance—growth, employment, and\ninflation.\nAfter negative growth (contraction) in the first quarter of 2014 that was largely explained by bad weather, the economy experienced strong and accelerating growth through\nthe third quarter.\nGrowth in the fourth quarter is likely to be slower than the very strong third quarter. We are still working with very preliminary measures of fourth-quarter performance. At the\nAtlanta Fed, we expect the fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate to come in around 3 percent (annualized). That would produce an annual rate of growth\nin the second half around 4 percent. This is strong growth, and we believe there is solid momentum carrying over into 2015. Notwithstanding the equity market volatility of\nlast week, we're starting the year on an optimistic note in terms of real economic activity.\nGrowth of consumer spending appeared to accelerate toward the close of 2014. Personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of 9.2 percent in November,\nraising the year-over-year rate to 2.8 percent growth. Roughly half of the strong November growth of consumption was auto purchases, but other categories of spending\naccelerated as well. People seem to be more prepared to open their pocketbooks. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for December reached its highest\nreading since January 2007.\nAnother reason for optimism is that 2014 was a year of significantly improved employment conditions. Payrolls increased by almost 3 million, the strongest reading since\n2000, and the gains were spread across a wide range of industries. The headline unemployment rate fell by more than a percent over the year. The long-term unemployment\nrate, defined as 27 weeks or more, also declined meaningfully.\nAlso, we saw the smallest decline in five years in the participation in the labor market of working-age people. We believe this indicates increasing confidence in labor market\nprospects.\nOver the last year as the labor market has improved, we've paid special attention to trends in wages. Growing wages would validate tightening employment conditions and\nwould also support growth of consumer activity and prices. Both are highly desirable in current circumstances.\n\n\fThe recent evidence on wages has been mixed. A number of measures of wage growth remained well below historical norms throughout most of last year, while others did\ntick up slightly in the second and third quarters.\nBased on research, my team has advanced the thesis that the elevated number of people working part-time involuntarily is restraining wage growth. There are about 6.8\nmillion such workers as of December. It's encouraging that the number of involuntary part-time workers declined by almost a million over the past year, four times the\ndecrease in 2013.\nOverall, there was more improvement in labor markets in 2014 than in any other year of the recovery. Employment conditions are improving, and improving faster, and\nprospects of continued progress are encouraging moving into the new year.\nThe behavior of wages and prices, in contrast, remains less encouraging, and, frankly, somewhat puzzling in light of recent growth and jobs numbers.\nMost recent readings of inflation remain considerably below the Fed's notion of a healthy rate, that is, 2 percent. In spite of extremely accommodative interest-rate conditions,\ninflation readings have tracked well short of the 2 percent target for the past two years.\nAt the Atlanta Fed, we don't rely totally on any single measure of inflation. We use a dashboard approach to tracking and assessing the broad inflation picture. The\ncomponents that typically make up a traditional inflation forecast (including, for example, producer prices and commodity prices) are showing readings toward the lower end\nof their longer-term ranges.\nLet me summarize in captions. Solid growth. Improving employment conditions. Stronger consumer activity. But mixed wage growth and weak inflation readings.\nTaking account of all this, I see a positive outlook for 2015. I expect GDP growth to be around 3 percent for the year. I expect continued robust job creation accompanied by\ngrowing wages. And, while acknowledging some room for skepticism about the inflation picture, I'm looking for inflation to rise gradually through year-end. There will almost\ncertainly be weak inflation readings early in the year influenced by energy prices. But once that influence has passed, I expect inflation to move toward the Fed's targeted\nlonger-term run rate.\nPotential headwinds and downside risks\nWhat could derail or materially undermine this scenario? There are certainly risk concerns, whether we characterize them as potential headwinds or more serious downside\nrisks. The most concerning is a soft global growth outlook. We're observing a rather sharp contrast between U.S. economic prospects and those of much of the rest of the\nworld. The jittery financial markets last week probably can be explained, at least in part, by an interpretation of falling oil prices as reflecting weak global demand, deflation\ndata in Europe, and a resulting flight of capital to safety.\nI'm sure the question of the broad economic effects of falling oil prices is on your mind. I am of the view, based on a preliminary assessment by Atlanta Fed economists, that\nlower oil prices will be a net benefit to the U.S. economy. I expect a decline in energy-sector new investment and some falloff in employment to be more than offset by a\nboost to consumer activity. Also, the lower cost of oil imports should positively affect the net exports component of the GDP growth calculation.\nThe appreciation of the dollar since last summer will likely affect the export sector, to some extent. My view is that the impact of the dollar's more expensive exchange value\nand, for that matter, the direct impact of lower oil prices on the energy sector are not severe for the national economy as a whole. But whenever two major world \"prices\"\nadjust so markedly, unanticipated second- and third-order effects could result. Geopolitical event risk connected to the rapid adjustment of these globally high-impact prices\ncannot be dismissed. Analytical humility is a sensible posture.\nPolicy outlook\nThese are concerns, not my base-case scenario. As I said earlier, I think the momentum evident in the second half of 2014 will carry over into 2015, and the ongoing outlook\nwill remain solid.\nIf that is indeed the case, I believe the first action to raise interest rates will in all likelihood be justified by the middle of the year.\nThe phrase \"middle of the year\" is admittedly not very precise. That's purposeful on my part. Understandably, some financial market participants are fixated on what exact\nmonth the first move will occur. Perhaps it's easy for me to say, but I don't think the exact timing of liftoff is the most important concern. A couple of years hence, whether the\nfirst rate increase came at a particular meeting or another—whether a bit earlier or later than expected—isn't going to make a great deal of difference for the real, Main Street\neconomy.\nThe key liftoff decision criteria ought to be closely linked to the FOMC's two principal policy objectives—maximum employment and low and stable inflation. In my view, the\nbiggest factor influencing the actual timing of a liftoff decision should be the Committee's confidence that these objectives will be achieved in an acceptable timeframe and,\nespecially, that inflation will move at deliberate speed toward the target of 2 percent per annum.\nInflation readings and forecasts may be pivotal in deciding when to begin adjusting policy. As already explained, we are, at present, experiencing inflationary trends well\nbelow target, and our readings are complicated by more-than-normal noise associated with the drop in oil and gasoline prices, falling import prices, and softening of some\nmeasures of inflation expectations.\nIt's quite possible there will be considerable ambiguity in the picture presented by data in the first half of the year. Beyond the noise in inflation numbers, it's obvious there is\nsimply a lot moving around at this time—oil prices, the dollar, even quarterly growth numbers, in all likelihood.\nNoisy, jumpy data affect my confidence in the outlook. I'm likely to decide what policy decision to support based on where I think things are headed. When the numbers come\nin noisy, it's just harder.\nIf the early months of this year bring mixed news on the economy, the risk manager in me will lean to preferring a later date for the first policy move to an earlier one. That\nsaid, after six years of recovery and considering all that that has both transpired and been accomplished, I don't think we policymakers should get too rigid about liftoff a little\nearlier or later. My preferred timing may not be the Committee's consensus decision.\n\n\fJust as I think it's appropriate to downplay the exact timing of liftoff, I think it's important to understand that a decision to raise rates will not constitute the throwing of a switch\nfrom easy money conditions to tight. The rate environment will remain stimulative, even as the policy rate gradually rises, as I expect. The pace of rate increases will not be\npreordained. The path of policy will depend on the ongoing performance of the economy.\nAt the recent meeting of the FOMC in December, the Committee made an adjustment of its forward guidance by introducing the theme of patience in beginning to normalize\nthe stance of policy. I supported and expect to continue to support a patient approach, one that is relatively cautious and conservative as regards the pace of normalization of\nrates.\nConclusion\nNow let me offer a few closing thoughts. I hope you will take away from this talk a distinct sense of satisfaction and optimism regarding the recent and prospective\nperformance of the American economy.\nThe financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, the deep recession that followed, and the sluggish recovery after that presented extraordinary challenges, and the response involved\nthe use of extraordinary policy measures. I feel the Fed is coming nearer to the end of our job as defined by those extraordinary circumstances, and anticipation of the\nnormalization of monetary policy—interest rate policy—is appropriate. In that sense, I look for a new phase of policy to commence in 2015.\nLeaders of the Federal Reserve—both Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen—have repeatedly emphasized that the Fed's monetary policy is not a panacea, not a cure-all for all\nthe nation's economic challenges. In my opinion, many underlying fundamentals of the economy remain to be adequately addressed. When I use the word \"fundamentals,\" I\nhave in mind concerns such as the long-term fiscal balance; the strength and prospects of the middle class; the skills, capacity, and health of the workforce; the quality of\ninfrastructure; and funding and incentives for continuing innovation. Addressing these really big challenges is not the work of monetary policy, but monetary policy can be a\nfacilitator and shape a supportive environment for other actors—in the public sector, the private sector, and civil society—to tackle the hard work of strengthening these\nfundamentals. There's still work to be done.\nI will end with that thought—a call to action for everyone in the room.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nMore than a Few Good Data\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nCouncil for Quality Growth\nAtlanta, Georgia\nDecember 8, 2014\nKey points\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a December 8 speech to the Council for Quality Growth in Atlanta, shares his thoughts on current economic conditions\nand appropriate timing of a decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to begin raising interest rates.\nLockhart emphasizes that the FOMC decision to begin raising the Fed's policy rate, which has been set at effectively zero since December 2008, will be data-driven.\nLockhart: There has been broad-based evidence of steadily improving employment conditions, with net payroll jobs being added at a monthly rate averaging 241,000 jobs\nso far this year.\nLockhart says that the current U.S. inflation picture is not so encouraging. Inflation for the past two-and-a-half years has been stuck below the 2 percent target.\nLockhart foresees sustained GDP growth at an annualized rate around 3 percent and the jobless rate falling to between 5 1/4 percent and 5 1/2 percent by year-end 2015\namid firming inflation measures.\nLockhart cautions that challenging conditions in Japan and Europe present potential spillover risks to the U.S. economy.\nCurrent momentum in the U.S. economy, says Lockhart, makes interest rate liftoff likely in mid-year 2015 or later.\n\nOne of my favorite movies is A Few Good Men starring Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise. I've seen it five or six times. It's about the murder of a\nMarine private down at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and the trial of two young Marines who thought they were roughing up a slacker under orders.\nAt bottom, it's about a narrative that does not hold up and hang together.\nThe Tom Cruise character, Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, a Navy JAG officer who has been assigned to defend the two Marines, puts the Jack Nicholson\ncharacter—Colonel Nathan Jessup—on the stand. Colonel Jessup is a hardened Marine commander of Gitmo. He can barely contain his resentment\nof the young Navy lawyer and his disgust at being called to testify.\nThe scene builds to a climax when Lieutenant Kaffee confronts Colonel Jessup:\nPrivate Santiago was begging for a transfer. But when he finally got it, how many people did he call? Not one call to his parents or a friend saying he was coming. He\nwas asleep at midnight and you say he had a flight out in six hours. Yet everything he owned was in his closet or his foot locker. Santiago was leaving for the rest of\nhis life and he hadn't called a soul or packed a thing. Can you explain that?\nToday I'm going to review with you another narrative and ask the questions: Is it holding up? Does it hang together? I'm going to present my narrative of the path of the\ncountry's economy. This is the basic narrative on which I'm basing my thinking on the appropriate timing of a decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to\nbegin raising interest rates.\nConsidering that the Fed's policy rate has been set at effectively zero since December 2008, the decision, when it comes, will be historic. As you might expect, my colleagues\nand I feel a great responsibility to get it right.\nAs members of the development community, I know you are quite interested in when and how this decision will be made. I know your business interests are highly attuned to\nthe evolving interest-rate environment, the capitalization rates associated with the cost of money, and general demand conditions in the economy.\nSince we are nearing year-end and will soon enter what could very well be a transitional year in terms of monetary policy, this is a good time to review the economic story line\nof 2014 as prologue to laying out the outlook for 2015.\nAs I do all this, please keep in mind that I'm presenting my personal views. My colleagues on the FOMC and in the Federal Reserve System may not agree.\nDevising a narrative\nBefore I get to a summary of 2014 and my outlook for 2015, let me explain how my staff at the Atlanta Fed and I do our work of economic forecasting and then fitting my\npolicy positions to the state of the economy. We construct a narrative of the path of the economy and the risks, both downside and upside, to that narrative. We continuously\nassess the validity of our narrative in light of incoming data. If the data are, on balance, consistent with our basic narrative, we stick with it. But when enough evidence has\naccumulated to seriously challenge the key assumptions in our narrative, we change our assumptions and adjust our narrative.\nColonel Jessup: \"You want answers?\"\nLieutenant Kaffee: \"I think I'm entitled to them.\"\nColonel Jessup: \"You want answers?\"\n\n\fLieutenant Kaffee: \"I want the truth!\"\nColonel Jessup: \"You can't handle the truth!\"\nGreat scene!\nIn economics, absolute truth is elusive, but here's what I'm thinking. Here's my economic narrative: For about a year now, I've put forth the view that the economy has shifted\nto a higher growth gear compared to the sluggish pace of growth over the first four years of recovery from recession. From the summer of 2009, when the recovery began, to\nmid-year 2013, growth averaged 2.2 percent. It has been my belief that, starting mid-year 2013, the pace of growth accelerated to around 3 percent, and that this growth rate\nwill be sustained at least through 2015.\nIf that story holds up, the economy should continue to make substantial progress in terms of the two statutory objectives that make up the FOMC's dual mandate. Those\nobjectives are maximum employment and low and stable inflation.\nLet's take a closer look at how 2014 has unfolded. I should mention that given the lag in receiving data and the likelihood of revisions, it will be well into 2015 before we can\nclose the book on 2014. But based on what we know now, full-year 2014 GDP growth should come in a little above 2 percent.\nOn the face of it, that number seems at odds with my 3 percent growth narrative. But when the tale of 2014 is told, I think it will be about one crazy, anomalous quarter and\nthree quarters of solid growth.\nThe first quarter of this year actually saw contraction of the economy approaching 2 percent. You will remember that much of that weakness was explained by unusual\nweather. My staff and I believed at the time, and with benefit of perspective we still hold, that the weak first quarter was a one-off event, not indicative of a trend. The strength\nof GDP growth in the second and third quarters seems to vindicate this view. With more than 4 percent annualized GDP growth in the second quarter and 3.9 percent growth\nestimated for the third quarter, our narrative seems to have remained intact.\nWe are well into the fourth quarter now, of course, and we expect this quarter to show a slowing of growth compared to the third. Our most recent estimate points to 2.1\npercent annualized growth in the fourth quarter. We are prepared to interpret this slower growth as normal and predictable quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, not the start of a\nmore persistent slowdown. We think the growth rate in the second half will come in at about 3 percent, the run rate that anchors our basic narrative of the path of the\neconomy.\nPolicy decisions are guided by the outlook for achievement of the two objectives in the FOMC's dual mandate. So employment conditions and measures of inflation and\ninflation expectations are vital signs we monitor closely. To date in 2014, there has been ample and broad-based evidence of steady improvement of employment conditions.\nI'm sure you are aware of Friday's jobs number—321,000 for November. Net payroll jobs have been added at a monthly rate averaging 241,000 over the past 11 months. The\nconventional measure of unemployment has fallen from 6.7 percent at the end of last year to 5.8 percent in its last calculation (November). I don't think we're yet able to claim\nultimate employment victory, but there is no question that substantial progress has been achieved and momentum looks to be pretty solid. The employment vital signs are\nvery encouraging.\nThe inflation picture is not as encouraging. In January 2012, the FOMC set an inflation target of 2 percent over the long run as measured by the overall index of personal\nconsumption expenditures. For much of the past two-and-a-half years, inflation has been stuck well below that 2 percent target. We've seen little evidence of upward price\npressures across the economy, and very few of our business contacts claim much pricing power. Behind this soft inflation picture lies a very modest pace of growth of\nconsumer spending.\nI have to say that simultaneous readings of robust job creation accompanied by falling unemployment and weak inflation are somewhat puzzling. The story doesn't hang\ntogether perfectly. Normally, we would expect a 3 percent run rate of GDP growth—a rate that is above what we believe to be the longer-run trend rate of growth of the\nAmerican economy—to be accompanied by both improving employment conditions and firming prices. But that is not what we're currently seeing.\nIt's possible we may be reading too much into measures of improvement in the labor market. Or we may be overestimating the underlying strength and momentum of the\neconomy.\nColonel Jessup to Lieutenant Kaffee: \"Are we clear?\"\nLieutenant Kaffee: \"Yes, sir.\"\nColonel Jessup: \"Are we clear?\"\nLieutenant Kaffee: \"Crystal.\"\nThe data are not presenting a picture that is crystal clear. There's some ambiguity.\nOutlook and the normalization decision\nFor now, I'm prepared to treat the conundrum of strong job creation and soft price pressures as suggesting some risk around my baseline outlook for 2015. I'm holding to an\noutlook of continuing growth around 3 percent. I'm expecting payroll job creation to continue at a rate of more than 200,000 a month. I'm expecting broad measures of\nunemployment to continue lower. I'm expecting the rate of unemployment, using the familiar headline unemployment rate published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to fall\nbetween 5 1/4 percent and 5 1/2 percent by the end of next year. And I'm expecting measures of inflation to firm up over the coming year.\nWage gains may be a telling signal that the economy remains on this basic course, a course that may justify raising interest rates. Broad-based rising labor compensation will\ntell us we're nearing effective full employment. And some amount of higher unit labor cost to employers should pass through to prices.\nIn the four years before the recession, measures of labor compensation growth were running between 3 1/2 and 4 percent. This was consistent with inflation tracking at close\nto 2 percent a year and labor productivity growth between 1 1/2 and 2 percent a year.\n\n\fFor much of the recovery—that is, since 2009—wage and compensation growth has been stuck at around 2 percent a year.\nBack to my comment that we may be reading too much into the falling unemployment rate—my staff and I think this soft wage pressure mostly reflects the still considerable\namount of underutilized labor resources in the economy. Our empirical work suggests that some amount of downward pressure stunting wage growth is coming from the\nlarge supply of people willing to take part-time jobs when they want full-time jobs. We believe there is more slack in the labor market than indicated simply by the share of the\nlabor force that is currently out of work.\nEven so, labor market conditions, as reflected in wages, are unquestionably strengthening. Some measures of wage growth have accelerated a bit recently. The Employment\nCost Index grew at an annualized 3 percent in the third quarter. Average hourly wage growth showed encouraging strength in November. And the number of involuntary parttime workers continues to gradually decline.\nAmong the payoffs from fuller utilization of labor resources, accompanied by moderately higher growth of wages, should be a boost to aggregate spending. Growth of\nconsumer spending is a key ingredient of my outlook of sustained GDP growth around 3 percent.\nRisks to the outlook\nI've presented what is, on balance, a positive outlook acknowledging real momentum going into 2015. But there are always risks.\nColonel Jessup: I eat breakfast 300 yards from 4,000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.\nIn our narrative building and validation, we identify risks, but we do not necessarily factor them into our baseline scenario.\nOne risk to our baseline scenario is weakness abroad—particularly in Europe and Japan. Japan is technically in recession, according to the latest estimate of its third quarter.\nBoth Europe and Japan are fighting to ward off the threat of deflation. Also, China's economy appears to be slowing. In general, the external environment seems somewhat\nprecarious, which raises concerns of spillover to our economy and financial markets.\nAs regards domestic risk to the outlook, I've already explained that the fourth quarter may prove to be slower than the third. I don't see this as signaling the onset of a\nslowdown. The momentum I perceive in the economy gives me confidence that the Federal Open Market Committee can consider beginning to normalize interest rates in\n2015. My publicly stated projection of liftoff is mid-year or later.\nIt will be a Committee decision, of course. And the Committee has been clear that a decision to begin normalization will be data-dependent. It will depend on how the\neconomy performs, how the numbers come in, and, importantly, on what the pattern of those numbers suggests as a continuing outlook.\nConcluding points\nIf I as a policymaker intend to stay true to data-dependency in making a decision to begin raising rates, I have to bear in mind what I will know and when I will know it in 2015.\nGiven the lag in receiving data, the inevitable revisions to the data, and the predictable month-to-month variability of the data, I think it will be a few months before we can be\nsure the essential trends are solid and the economy is ready for a momentous shift of policy.\nIt's natural for us policymakers, business leaders like you, and the public in general to be eager to get to policy normalization. Who does not want things to move closer to a\nlong-run normal? But I think the FOMC must do its best to avoid having to reverse course because, as it could turn out, we moved too early.\nOther central banks have seen this happen. The European Central Bank and the central banks of Sweden, Norway, Australia, and Japan have raised rates only to lower\nthem when their forecasts didn't materialize.\nThere would be real costs associated with an irresolute path of policy. Suffice it to say, reversing a start to interest-rate normalization, and subsequently having to go back to\nthe quantitative easing well, would erode Fed credibility and confidence in the economy for the longer term.\nColonel Jessup to the judge: \"I don't know what the hell kind of unit you're running here.\"\nI'm sure my colleagues, especially Janet Yellen, would not like to hear something like that.\nLet me wrap up. The balance of current economic evidence is encouraging and supports an optimistic outlook. That said, knowing what I know today, I think patience\nregarding timing liftoff and a cautious bias regarding the subsequent pace of rate moves is a sensible approach to policy. I don't see the risks of a patient approach as\nexcessive.\nI've presented here today a working narrative of the performance of the economy in recent and coming quarters. In its basics, it foresees sustained GDP growth at an\nannualized rate around 3 percent, continued absorption of underutilized labor resources, and gradual movement toward the 2 percent inflation objective. If it continues to hold\nup, and I think it will, 2015 looks to be a year of policy transition.\nColonel Jessup: \"You want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.\"\nI mean nothing by ending with that quote. I just love the quote.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nStrategic Workforce Development: Training for Employability\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nKeynote remarks for Community Development Conference:\nTransforming U.S. Workforce Development Policies for the 21st Century\nRutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey\nOctober 16, 2014\nKey points\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in October 16 keynote remarks at the Community Development Conference at Rutgers University, offers his thoughts on\nstrategic workforce development.\nLockhart focuses on three elements of strategic workforce development: soft skills, hard skills, and changing employer-employee work arrangements.\nLockhart cites anecdotal input from the Atlanta Fed's business contacts, who report a deficit in soft skills among job applicants. Soft skills encompass work ethic, attitude,\nand interpersonal skills, and are often a prerequisite for employability.\nLockhart believes job-specific requirements, or hard skills, will become more digitally demanding. In his view, problem analysis, troubleshooting, and critical thinking will be\nessential hard skills in the \"second machine age.\"\nLockhart says employer–employee work arrangements will be similarly fluid. Current trends—including the increased use of part-time, temporary, and contract workers—\nseem to have momentum.\nLockhart believes more workforce training will occur outside of employers, which will require better alignment among workforce training providers, educators, and\nemployers. To support this shift, the Atlanta Fed has catalyzed a new program, the Metro Atlanta Exchange for Workforce Solutions (MAX), which launches in December.\n\nGood morning. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and its Community and Economic Development team, I'm pleased to add my\nwelcome to the conference. Together with our partners—the Kansas City Fed and the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development here at\nRutgers University—we are presenting this conference to encourage innovative thinking about workforce development.\nYesterday afternoon, Harry Holzer of Georgetown University ably set the scene and described the demographic, technological, and social context of\nworkforce policy. He made the case for major changes, and I understand his remarks were well received.\nThe agenda for the remainder of the conference is appropriately ambitious. There are sessions on various target worker cohorts: the long-term\nunemployed, disabled workers, young workers. There are sessions on getting the facts straight and knowing what works through data analysis. The\npanel moderated by Ambassador Murphy will look at what we might learn from institutions and initiatives in Europe. And there are big-picture\nsessions that will build on Professor Holzer's opening session addressing questions like how to adapt formal workforce development efforts to\nchanging realities and evolving challenges. This is a rich menu. I expect everyone here will find something of value to take away.\nFor my part, over the next few minutes, I want to offer some thoughts on preparing workers to be and remain employable. I will make a distinction between training for\nimmediate, near-term employment and training (and retraining) to improve an individual's prospects of lifelong employability. I will comment on trends that will shape the\nreality of employer needs and wants over the longer run.\nJack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric, is reported to have said that he could not—as head of GE—guarantee a current GE employee employment, but he felt he\ncould guarantee employability, even if somewhere else. He meant, as I understand it, that the experience of working for GE ought to make a GE employee employable\nelsewhere. Implicit in his statement was a sense of responsibility on the part of large employers to play a real role in fostering the employability of people in the workplace.\nAs I see it, the workforce development community, for its part, divides its attention between two areas of focus. One is what you might call remedial efforts to help the hard-toemploy or those looking for a second chance after losing a job. The other area of focus is strategic workforce development, with the ultimate aim of sustained economic\ndevelopment of a metro area, a state, or the country. In my remarks this morning, I will address the second of these—strategic workforce development including interventions\nto enhance employability.\nObviously this is a big subject. To make it manageable in the time I have, I'll reflect on three topics. They are: prerequisites for employability (sometimes called \"soft skills\"),\n\"hard skills\" (or harder skills) for the long run, and changing employer-employee work arrangements.\nDeveloping soft skills early\nTo introduce the topic of soft skills, let me explain that the Federal Reserve is required by statute to set monetary policy with two objectives in mind—low inflation and\nmaximum employment. This is the Fed's so-called \"dual mandate.\" To evaluate employment conditions, my Reserve Bank conducts frequent and systematic interviews of\nemployers during the period between meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, the entity that sets monetary policy. We ask businesses and other major employers\nabout their hiring plans, their recruiting challenges, their willingness to spend on training, and their current wage policy.\nThroughout the economic recovery, we have heard a great deal about a perceived soft skills deficit on the part of job applicants. This is anecdotal input from contacts, not\nempirically grounded hard data. We take care not to interpret anecdote as fact. I will say, however, that the frequency of such comments coming from a wide spectrum of\ncontacts makes me wonder if there isn't something real there. I'm asking myself if our feedback from employers calls for a structured effort to determine the extent of the\nproblem and devise purposeful responses.\n\n\fAccording to many of these employers, their initial screening methods focus mostly on an applicant's readiness for employment. They look for prerequisite skills or individual\nattributes. Among the questions these employers try to answer are:\nDoes the person have the necessary work ethic and attitude?\nWill the person reliably show up for work on time, every day?\nCan the person work with others?\nDoes the person present himself or herself in a professional manner?\nAnd finally, can the applicant pass the drug test?\nJudging from the number of mentions, this last question concerns itself with a very real hurdle to employability in certain vocations.\nFormal efforts to engage prospective workers along these softer dimensions of attitudes, workplace conduct, and personal habits are most effective if started early in a\nworking career or even before. Successful programs like \"Year Up\" are addressing these concerns head on by working with young adults in eight metro areas nationwide to\ndevelop professional demeanor and personal presentation skills. Year Up backs this up with stipends, internships, and college credits—all to put the individual on the path to\neconomic self-sufficiency.\nA second example is the STRIVE model. The STRIVE approach, a national program that started in Cincinnati, helps communities build a local education ecosystem with\nsustainable civic infrastructure. The idea is to create a cradle-to-career approach to development. In Atlanta, we've seen the STRIVE model in action in an organization called\nNew Hope Enterprises. This group has been effective in raising soft skills as well as improving neighborhood life. Successful programs like \"12 for Life\" blend work education\nwith content designed to raise students' commitment to, and even passion for, work. Mike Wiggins, a founder of Southwire's 12 for Life program, spoke yesterday evening, I\nbelieve.\nI really think we need more work in the soft skills area, including development of effective training for adult workers. Complaints about soft skills are just too prevalent to\ndismiss entirely.\nFor many members of the workforce—especially, but not exclusively, the hard-to-employ—the prerequisites I've noted are just that. They are first tests of employability in\nadvance of consideration of actual job qualifications.\nFostering hard skills for the \"second machine age\"\nLet me shift the focus now to so-called hard skills and trends affecting employer needs.\nA recent McKinsey article entitled \"The Great Decoupling\" starts with the statement, \"As machine learning advances at exponential rates, many highly skilled jobs once\nconsidered the exclusive domain of humans are increasingly being carried out by computers.\" The same article quotes from a recent book by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew\nMcAfee called The Second Machine Age.\nThat's a useful phrase, so I'll borrow it. We can quibble about the meaning of highly skilled, middle skilled, and low skilled, but I'll argue that the second machine age has\nseen the automation of many middle-skill jobs. It has contributed to the phenomenon of job polarization and middle-class income stagnation. Job polarization refers to the\ndecline of mid-level positions relative to higher-level and lower-skilled jobs.\nIn work last year on job polarization, my staff cited a very useful framework for categorizing work that was developed by David Autor and David Dorn. Think of four quadrants\ninvolving the interplay of brain work and the nature of discrete tasks in a job. The four categories are routine/noncognitive, routine/cognitive, nonroutine/cognitive and\nnonroutine/noncognitive. Machine and computer substitution is bearing down on both the routine/noncognitive and routine/cognitive categories. Nonroutine/cognitive jobs are\nthe high-skill positions requiring advanced education, critical and analytical thinking, sophisticated communication, and complex problem solving. As the second machine age\naccelerates, only the lowest-skill, noncognitive, nonroutine kinds of work will be immune from attempts at automation, in my opinion.\nTwenty years ago, I attended a seminar featuring the great Peter Drucker. In the course of the conference, one of the presenters asked rhetorically, \"Is there anything you\nwould not buy online?\" Participants mentioned a number of goods and services that are now routinely purchased online. Fast forward to today. It's worth asking, \"Is there any\nwork machines cannot do?\" I predict that many of the tasks running through your minds at this moment will be automated in some form 20 years from now. Indeed, I would\nargue that even today, we're seeing machine operators of all kinds becoming machine tenders who monitor digital interface devices and intervene only if something goes\nwrong. As a prominent bank economist put it in a recent newsletter, \"Manufacturing jobs are far less blue-collar today and more business casual.\" And who has not noticed\nchanges in supermarkets and other retailers where one employee monitors the sales of four to six checkout stations?\nWe are seeing a wide range of relatively low- and middle-skill vocations under siege. As examples, I would point to production-line manufacturing positions, waiters, retail\ncheckout clerks, hotel check-in personnel, and customer service staff. Maybe, before long, the list will include drivers.\nThe process of substitution will likely be gradual, but I find it hard to believe the trend will reverse. If you accept as reality the persistence and growth of automation, robotics,\nproduction algorithms, and digitization in general, I don't think it's difficult to imagine what jobs will increasingly require as hard skills and consequently what strategic\nworkforce development will entail.\nHere are some thoughts: Most workers will deal with a digital interface device of some kind. Familiarity with technology and the literacy and numeracy skills to operate such a\ndevice will be essential.\nIn a world where much that is routine and repeatable is done by machine, human work will call for problem analysis and troubleshooting, critical thinking where judgment and\ndiscretion are required, and fine, customized work involving customer or colleague interaction and communication. Making emotional connections is human work.\nWorkers will need lifelong learning skills to adapt to changing job requirements dictated by the pace of substitution of technology for what they used to do.\nChanging work arrangements between employers and workers\nJust as job-specific requirements will be fluid over time, employer-employee work arrangements have their own fluid character. A number of current trends in the field of\nworkforce management seem to have momentum.\n\n\fWorkforce management practices include the use of temporary staff as a permanent and flexible workforce component, the use of contractors (I've heard them called \"1099\nemployees\") for project work or as a semipermanent workforce, and the structuring of job positions as part-time.\nAt the Atlanta Fed, we've done some research on the part-time phenomenon. I'll share some of our findings.\nFirst, the share of employed people working fewer than 35 hours a week rose sharply during the Great Recession. That fact in itself is not surprising. Employers will often\nrespond to a drop-off in demand by cutting hours of employees to avoid layoffs. However, the part-time share of employment has been slow to decline since the recession\nended. Typically, hours are restored in a recovery, but this has not so much been the case in this recovery. Involuntary part-time employment seems to have become, to\nsome extent, a structural thing. Part-time positions are prevalent in certain industries such as food service, hospitality, and construction, but our research finds that use of\npart-timers has become quite widespread.\nTo understand whether the shift to part-time jobs is structural in nature, we conducted a survey of 340 businesses in the Southeast, of which 86 currently have a higher share\nof part-time workers than before the recession. We found that two reasons were most commonly cited for elevated use of part-time employees. One was weak sales. This\nwould suggest a cyclical driver. The other explanation was the perceived higher all-in compensation cost—even when adjusted for hours—of full-time versus part-time\nworkers. We've concluded that there will likely be some falloff in use of part-time personnel as the economy strengthens further, but probably not to prerecession levels. In\nother words, preference for part-time workers is likely to persist. For Fed policy purposes, the balance of evidence suggests the labor market is still far from normal, even if\nnormal is not what it used to be.\nWhat might be the implications of the growth of part-time employment? Clearly, employers are seeking staffing agility. Employers want to stay nimble to adjust quickly to a\nfall-off of business. They increasingly want the flexibility afforded by a mix of employment arrangements with varying degrees of commitment to classes of employee.\nImpermanent part-time workers are least likely to receive significant employer-sponsored training. The training burden is likely to fall outside employers. The workforce\ndevelopment community is going to have to come to grips with this new reality.\nConclusion\nTo close, I'll summarize: What I've called \"strategic workforce development\" for long-term employability must anticipate, to paraphrase the great Wayne Gretsky, where the\npuck is going. In my view, the employability of young people and adults who are deficient in soft skills will go nowhere but down. The job-specific requirements in most\nindustries and vocations will evolve rapidly and become more digitally demanding, if you will, in the second machine age. Widening automation and digitization will reduce\nroutine job tasks, both cognitive and noncognitive. To be and remain employable, workers will trade on what cannot be programmed. And work arrangements with employers\nmay be structured to provide those employers more tactical flexibility in their workforce management.\nThis is what I imagine going forward. It's our view at the Atlanta Fed that to be responsive to this future, the workforce development system needs to operate with greater\ncoherence, cohesion, and coordination if it is to remain relevant. Through our Community and Economic Development program, we're working to help workforce training\nproviders, educators, and employers become better aligned. To this end, we've catalyzed a program called the Metro Atlanta Exchange for Workforce Solutions (or MAX).\nThis effort brings together more than 25 entities as partners to think and act in a more coordinated and streamlined fashion. This initiative will be officially launched in\nDecember. It's our hope it will help prepare the region's workforce development stakeholders for the reality of a 21st century economy.\nThank you for your attention this morning. And thank you for attending this important conference.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Transforming U.S. Workforce Development Policies for the 21st Century • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nKey Questions for Monetary Policy\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nMississippi Council on Economic Education\n2014 U.S. Senator Thad Cochran Forum on American Enterprise\nJackson, Mississippi\nSeptember 25, 2014\nKey points\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a September 25 speech before the Mississippi Council on Economic Education, shares his views on monetary policy\nover the medium term.\nLockhart's medium-term economic outlook calls for continued moderate growth around 3 percent annually accompanied by a substantial closing of the employment and\ninflation gaps. He notes that the economy's performance in coming quarters will dictate the decision to raise interest rates. He expects conditions for policy liftoff to ripen by\nmid-2015 or later.\nLockhart believes the United States will approach conditions consistent with full employment by late 2016 or early 2017. He believes the gap between headline\nemployment and broader measures, such as the number of people working part-time for economic reasons, suggests there is more work to do before we can be satisfied\nwith employment conditions.\nLockhart describes two inflation worries: persistent undershooting of the FOMC's 2 percent inflation goal and an overshoot of the goal that gets out of hand. Of those, a\npersistent undershoot is a bigger concern, in his view.\nLockhart also addresses concerns that the extended period of low rates might be feeding the risk of financial instability. He is comfortable that being patient regarding liftoff\nwill not trigger a systemic financial event.\nLockhart is also carefully monitoring geopolitical risks. He says that financial markets seem to reflect a view that the U.S. real economy enjoys some insulation from severe\nspillover risk.\n\nThank you for honoring me with the invitation to be your keynote speaker today. As you may know, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta shares your\ngoal to increase economic and financial literacy among our citizens. In fact, our New Orleans Branch staff has worked closely with the Mississippi\nCouncil on Economic Education for the past decade. Together, they produce \"Focus on the Economy,\" an annual conference that attracts teachers\nfrom throughout Mississippi for sessions about the Fed, the economy, personal finance, and related topics. I am pleased to continue that tradition of\npartnership here this afternoon.\nToday I want to share my views on current and prospective monetary policy with a medium-term horizon. I'll start by describing the context in which\nthe most recent decisions on monetary policy were made. I will round out my remarks with commentary on five front-and-center questions. They are\nquestions my colleagues and I are having to engage as we shape monetary policy and public expectations.\nI must emphasize that the views you'll hear are my personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC). There is a healthy spread of opinion on the FOMC. I can assure you I have colleagues in the Federal Reserve System who will not entirely agree\nwith my views.\nBefore laying out the five questions, let me provide some background.\nFOMC decisions change little\nLast week, I participated in a two-day meeting of the FOMC. The Committee's decisions involved very little change. The policy interest rate—the target range for the federal\nfunds rate—was kept at zero to 25 basis points. This decision continues the policy of keeping the bellwether Fed policy rate effectively as low as it can go. The policy of a\nrock-bottom policy rate has been in effect since the fourth quarter of 2008.\nThe statement that followed the meeting was updated in small ways from the July statement but conveyed little change in the outlook for the economy and the outlook for\npolicy. Importantly, there was no substantive change in our forward guidance about how long the policy rate will be held at an effective rate of zero. The Committee reiterated\nthe view that \"liftoff\" (the timing of the first move to raise rates) will likely occur a \"considerable time\" after the end of asset purchases (or QE, short for \"quantitative easing\")\nin October. The end of QE next month is now virtually certain. The statement also repeated the expectation of the Committee that once liftoff occurs, rates will rise at a\ngradual pace.\nI supported the Committee's decision to stay the course in both substance and language. For my part, I continue to expect conditions for liftoff to ripen by the middle of 2015\nor a bit later.\nThere are two more FOMC meetings this year and eight next year. As each meeting approaches, speculation will intensify that the Committee will signal in some way when\nthe tightening cycle will begin. The timing isn't foreordained. The performance of the economy in the coming quarters should and will dictate the timing of liftoff. This\nconditionality has been expressed by stressing that the decision will be data-dependent. The phrase \"data-dependent\" is a kind of shorthand, as I see it. It's shorthand for a\nprocess of assessing, based on the best and most recent evidence we have, whether the economy is on the track we assume it's on. The data should tell us whether the\noutlook has worsened materially and give some hint as to whether downside risks around the outlook have intensified.\nLet me lay out in broad strokes my sense of the outlook. I expect GDP (gross domestic product) to grow at an average annual rate of 3 percent this quarter and next and\nthrough next year. Inflation, by most measures, is running below the FOMC's longer-run target of 2 percent. I expect inflation to firm up gradually as the economy continues\n\n\fon a 3 percent growth track. And I expect unemployment and underemployment to continue to decline at a steady pace. I think the country will approach a condition near full\nemployment by late 2016 or early 2017. I'll ask you to keep this forecast in mind as I walk you through five questions confronting policymakers.\nQuestion 1: Is the 3 percent growth story holding up?\nYes, it appears so. The first half of the year 2014 had some wild swings from contraction in the first quarter to growth over 4 percent in the second. The second quarter had\nnonrecurring elements of a rebound from the drop-off in the first quarter. At this date, we have only tracking estimates for the third quarter. Tracking estimates gauge\napparent growth in real time and make adjustments with each incoming piece of data. Most tracking estimates for the third quarter—including our own at the Atlanta Fed—\ngauge growth this quarter at around 3 percent.\nThe recent run of data has been encouraging in many respects. Manufacturing data have shown improvement. The services sector has also seen improving activity.\nConsumer and business confidence indicators are rising.\nHowever, consumer activity per se has been growing only at a tepid pace, especially if you exclude auto sales. To be confident in an outlook of 3 percent or greater growth,\nwe need to see consistency in consumer spending. The housing sector also raises some concern, and the recent appreciation of the dollar may dampen export activity in\ncoming months.\nIn some respects, I view GDP growth as a means to an end. A chief end is full employment. The question is whether the pace of growth is enough to sustain progress in\nreducing underutilization of labor resources in the economy. Will we get enough growth to continue to shrink labor market slack? That sets up the second question.\nQuestion 2: How much labor market slack remains?\nFederal Reserve policy makers face the question of how much labor market slack remains. In its post-meeting communication last week, the Committee repeated the claim\nthat significant underutilization of labor resources persists. I agree with this view.\nAs you no doubt have heard or read, the recent national monthly payroll jobs report for August was disappointing relative to the average rate of jobs growth for the prior\nseven months. At the same time, the official unemployment rate—which stands at 6.1 percent—has been stuck around that level for a few months. I wouldn't read too much\ninto short-term movements in the data. I think steady progress is still the right characterization of employment markets.\nNo one measure of employment conditions tells the full story, in my view. I pay attention to a wide variety of indicators. In computing the unemployment rate, for example, if\nyou worked an hour for pay in the last month, you're employed. A broader measure treats some part-time workers—namely those working part-time involuntarily—as not fully\nemployed.\nThe same broader measure includes the so-called marginally attached in the workforce and in the ranks of unemployed. Marginally attached workers are available for work\nbut, for whatever reasons, have not looked for work in the last month. It's worrisome that the proportion of prime-working age men has grown among the marginally attached.\nThe current level of headline unemployment is still some distance from my notion of full employment. And the gap between headline unemployment and broader measures\nsuggests there is more work to do before we should be satisfied with employment conditions in the country.\nQuestion 3: What is the risk of inflation?\nOne way to assess the extent of labor slack is by observing wage pressures. Wage growth for the most part has been quite slow. We are not yet seeing much indication of\nbroad-based wage or compensation pressure. Rising wages can be viewed as a link between employment conditions and broad price pressures, or inflation. Inflation is\nalways a central banker's concern. I frequently hear a question about what inflation risk might be associated with keeping interest rates so low for longer. That's question\nthree.\nAs I said earlier, inflation is running below the 2 percent target the FOMC established in January of 2012. Inflation ran considerably below target for most of 2013 and early in\nthis year. We saw some encouraging firming of prices in the spring, but recently measures of inflation have backed up a little. Separating short-term and transient effects from\nthe underlying trend is always challenging. In its fundamentals, inflation is reflecting what are still, in my view, lukewarm demand conditions. I expect the inflation rate to rise\nonly gradually to a sustainable 2 percent.\nThere are two legitimate inflation worries. One is persistent undershooting, with all this would imply for the strength of economic activity. The other is an overshoot that gets\nout of hand. At this juncture, I'm more concerned about a persistent undershoot. I am relatively sanguine about the risk of a strong and undesired upside surge in inflation.\nInflation expectations, which are very influential in shaping real outcomes, continue to be firmly anchored. Also, in talking to business contacts, I hear almost no claims of\npricing power.\nQuestion 4: What about financial stability?\nAnother important question about the risk associated with keeping rates so low for longer is this: What risk of financial system instability might the Fed be feeding? Are we\ninviting another financial crisis?\nIt's clear that U.S. equity market indexes are hitting historic highs. It's clear that buoyant bond markets are pricing in some continuation of ultra-low interest rate policy. And\nit's clear that investors have been searching for yield for quite some time.\nAs a policymaker, I have to think about two scenarios. The first is that bond markets are somehow surprised in the coming months and that the transition to a period of\ntightening is disruptively and destructively volatile. Last year's so-called \"taper tantrum\" in the bond markets is something to avoid. The second scenario would resemble the\nrecent financial crisis, not perhaps in its particulars, but in the sense that it was a systemic event.\nTo my mind, the key filter in assessing risk levels in this regard is the word \"systemic.\" I am comfortable that being patient regarding liftoff until the middle of next year or\nperhaps a little later will not bring on a systemic financial event. I take comfort in the much-strengthened defenses of the banking system, financial institutions in general, and\nfinancial regulators. I take comfort in the enhanced capital levels of the most systemically important institutions. I think defenses are dramatically improved, and the resilience\nof the financial system is measurably stronger than in 2007.\n\n\fQuestion 5: What about geopolitical risks?\nMy fifth and final question relates to the global context. With developments in the Middle East, tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, quite soft economic\nconditions in Europe, and challenges associated with a transitioning economy in China, it's fair to ask: how does a policymaker factor geopolitical risks into policy thinking?\nAll these developments and others are monitored carefully, I can assure you. All these sources of potential geopolitical or global economic risk have been in our\nconsciousness for a while.\nIn my assessment, this concern is appropriately about an escalation of trouble that comes on suddenly and with great force. Such a shock could spill over through financial or\ncommodity markets to the broad economy. It would be foolish to dismiss this risk entirely, but our financial markets seem to reflect a view that the U.S. real economy enjoys\nsome insulation from severe spillover risk. I think that's a realistic assessment.\nConclusion\nI'll close with this thought: there are always risks around a projection of any path forward. There is always considerable uncertainty. Given what I see today, I'm pretty\nconfident in a medium-term outlook of continued moderate growth around 3 percent per annum accompanied by a substantial closing of the employment and inflation gaps.\nIn general, I'm more confident today than a year ago. I see the balance of risk around this outlook as reasonably balanced. No one has a perfect crystal ball, but I am rather\nconfident that we'll get to economic conditions between mid- and late next year that would justify initiating a period of normalization of the interest rate environment.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThoughts on Liftoff\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nSixth Annual Rocky Mountain Economic Summit\nJackson Hole, Wyoming\nJuly 11, 2014\nKey points\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a July 11 speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, discusses the timing of liftoff, or the raising of the federal funds rate.\nLockhart ties a liftoff decision to the economy's proximity to achieving the FOMC's two monetary policy objectives, price stability and maximum employment.\nLockhart says inflation has been running below 2 percent, the FOMC's target rate, for quite a while, but very recently inflation numbers have been firming.\nLockhart believes the recent firming of price data removes some downside risk, but we should be seeing other indicators of the absorption of economic slack, especially\nwage growth.\nLockhart feels a number of troubling employment phenomena have been at work, including the drop in prime-age participation in the labor force and the number of people\nworking part-time for economic reasons.\nLockhart cites two risk considerations. He feels we have to contemplate the risk of a prolonged overshoot of 2 percent inflation and is also looking at financial system\nstability as a potential risk. But he is not overly concerned.\nWith all factors considered, Lockhart maintains the view that economic conditions that would justify a liftoff decision will arrive in the second half of next year.\n\nI plan to focus my prepared remarks before the conversation with John Silvia and my colleague, Charlie Evans, on the question that is increasingly\ncommanding the attention of Fed watchers, financial markets, and Fed policymakers. In its most succinct form that question is, \"When is liftoff?\" I\nwill share how I, as one policymaker, am approaching that policy question.\nAs always, I must emphasize that I'm presenting my individual views. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and in the\nFederal Reserve System may not see things the same way.\nCurrent stance of policy\nA useful place to start, I think, is a quick review of the current stance of monetary policy here at the beginning of the third quarter.\nCompletion of the tapering of asset purchases—which began last December—is now virtually a foregone conclusion. The minutes of the June\nFOMC meeting indicate the asset purchase program will end in October, leaving just ongoing reinvestment of maturing securities.\nThe majority of FOMC participants through their individual quarterly projections have indicated that the first move to raise short-term interest rates will likely come in 2015 or\n2016. Opinions vary among FOMC participants on whether the first policy action ought to come earlier or later. Chair Yellen—speaking for the Committee, in my view—has\nemphasized that the timing of the decision will depend on the evolution of the economy over coming quarters and will, therefore, be substantially data-driven.\nFinally, the Committee has stated that once a tightening process begins, it is likely to proceed at a gradual pace.\nThat's where policy stands at the moment.\nSo the question Charlie Evans and I are confronted with as policymakers is under what circumstances will it be appropriate to start raising the policy rate (the federal funds\nrate)?\nA framework for contemplating liftoff\nLet me lay out my current framework for thinking about that question.\nFirst, I tie a liftoff decision to achievement of the FOMC's two monetary policy objectives—price stability and maximum employment. This is not to say the Committee must or\nshould wait until those objectives have been fully and unarguably achieved. Rather, I think we will be in the zone of liftoff decision making when the outlook for\naccomplishment of the two objectives suggests they are in sight. By \"in sight\" I mean that given the trajectory of the economy, they are highly likely to be achieved in a\nreasonable timeframe. You might call this a \"whites of their eyes\" approach to pulling the trigger on raising rates.\nDetermining that the economy is near achieving price stability and full employment is not entirely straightforward. I'll explain why.\nThe FOMC has defined price stability as a 2 percent rate of inflation over the long run as gauged by the overall (or headline) price index of personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE).\nI define price stability operationally to be, therefore, at or near 2 percent on a sustained basis. Speaking for myself, I can tolerate some deviation above or below the 2\npercent target providing inflation does not drift too far away from target for too long.\n\n\fReading the true course of inflation can be challenging because of normal month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in the data as well as occasional shocks that cause\nepisodes of transient changes in the numbers.\nInflation has been running below 2 percent for quite a while, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by the FOMC in devising its policy stance. Very recently the PCE inflation\nnumbers have been firming along with other measures of price trends. Over the first five months of the year, the year-over-year inflation rate according to the PCE index rose\nfrom 1.2 percent to 1.8 percent. The three-month inflation rate, which is presented as an annualized rate, of course, rose from 1.4 percent in January to 2.5 percent in May.\nThe higher recent inflation numbers are welcome, in my view, and I do not see this development as cause for alarm. At the same time, I don't feel enough evidence has\narrived to be sure price stability is here or near. Inflation does not typically come forth in isolation. We should be seeing other indicators of the absorption of economic slack.\nWe should see accompanying wage growth especially. So far, such affirmation of the sustainability of recent firming has been meager. The recent firming of price data\nremoves some downside risk, in my opinion. But a test of time hasn't been met.\nIt's a challenge also to arrive at an agreed-on definition of maximum employment.\nThe conventional approach is to define maximum employment in terms of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' official unemployment rate (U-3 on their scale). Today, U-3 is at 6.1\npercent. My working estimate for full employment on this basis is, say, 5 1/4 percent.\nBut a number of troubling employment phenomena have been at work that make me less confident in the exclusive use of the unemployment rate. Two such phenomena are\nthe drop in prime-age participation in the labor force and the rise during the recession and subsequent slow reduction over the course of the recovery of people working parttime for economic reasons (PTER).\nIn current circumstances, a single measure of employment or unemployment does not provide a complete enough picture of what I care about in labor markets. I care about\nthe full utilization, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of available labor resources.\nMy assessment is that the gap to be closed on the employment objective is bigger than estimated by a simple comparison of today's U-3 unemployment rate and a projection\nof the equivalent unemployment rate at full employment.\nThat said, the report that came out on July 3 was certainly encouraging. As you know, the payroll survey showed the addition of 288,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell\nto 6.1 percent. The trends and momentum are undeniably positive. We've seen four months in a row of quite healthy jobs reports, suggesting more is going on than just a\nrebound from the weather-affected first quarter. My caution in declaring that I see the whites of full employment's eyes is closely linked to the still-elevated level of involuntary\npart-time employment. That measure of labor utilization has been stubborn when compared to the decline of headline unemployment. The number of people working parttime for economic reasons increased in June. This series has been declining over the year, but over the last few months, it has toggled back and forth.\nAlso, as mentioned earlier, we have been seeing very little upward wage pressure, and this tells me there remains considerable actual slack in employment markets. I want\nto emphasize the important role of wage pressures as evidence that the employment gap is in fact closing and, for that matter, that the inflation numbers are for real. Slow\nwage growth seems to be connected to the PTER story. Studies have identified an empirical connection between slow wage growth and the elevated level of part-time\nemployment.\nTo cut to my bottom line, the FOMC is still somewhat short of the point where achievement of the two objectives is confidently \"in sight,\" in my opinion.\nImportantly, the two objectives remain complementary. The same basic policy posture can promote accomplishment of both objectives, in my view. At the moment, there is\nlittle or no tradeoff between the two objectives. That could change, but that's how I see the situation for the foreseeable future.\nRisk considerations\nThere is another aspect of my framework for thinking about the circumstances that should accompany a decision to begin raising rates. I am also considering the risk picture.\nSpecifically, there are two risk concerns on my screen.\nFirst, given that the Committee is seeking to approach a 2 percent run rate of inflation from below, I think we have to contemplate the risk of a prolonged overshoot of 2\npercent.\nI don't believe the recent broad-based uptick of inflation measures necessarily portends that inflation is going to get out of hand. Inflation expectations remain well-anchored.\nThere is no sign that price makers, or the general public, anticipate a break with the experience of price stability the country has enjoyed for more than two decades.\nI am also monitoring the risk situation as regards financial system stability. With equity indexes at or near historic highs, financial market volatility very low, and evidence of\n\"reach for yield\" behavior, concern about financial system and market instability has been building. In the thinking of some observers, the potential for a rash of damaging\nfinancial system instability can be associated with a continued low-rate environment.\nAgain, while remaining watchful, I'm not overly concerned that financial market conditions today map to systemic risk concerns with high potential for spillover to the real\neconomy, the Main Street economy, if you will. My emphasis on \"systemic\" and \"spillover\" is intentional. I see a difference between some degree of fragility in financial\nmarkets due to investors widely carrying \"risk-on\" positions and the realistic chances of a broad, systemic meltdown that engulfs the broad economy. I think the latter should\nbe the Fed's and FOMC's greater concern.\nConclusion\nA policy position always involves a tradeoff of real or potential costs versus benefits. In my view, the potential and achievable benefits of sustaining very accommodative\nmonetary stimulus, based on a policy rate in its current range of 0 to 25 basis points, beyond year-end 2014 and into next year continue to outweigh the possible costs.\nMy outlook for the economy in the coming quarters underpins my judgment on the cost/benefit tradeoff of current policy. The key element of my outlook is a run rate of GDP\ngrowth at or better than 3 percent through the next several quarters. I am focusing on the run rate as opposed to a projected full-year 2014 GDP growth rate because the\n\n\fweak first quarter will push down the full-year arithmetic. I think the run rate from the second quarter onward is more relevant to policy decisions ahead. On balance, recent\ndata have supported a 3 percent GDP growth run rate assumption.\nI am still prepared to believe that the first-quarter contraction was an anomaly attributable substantially to weather, an inventory adjustment, health care spending, and\nexports. However, if there were temporary or unusual factors at work depressing the first quarter, then it is reasonable to expect that the lifting of those factors provided a\nbump in the numbers in the second quarter that may also have been transitory.\nThere is quite a divergence between what we thought was happening in the first quarter based on tracking estimates, for example, during the quarter and the ultimate verdict\non first-quarter growth (contraction). Tracking the economy in real time is very hard. The Bureau of Economic Analysis first told us first-quarter growth was 0.1 percent. This\nfirst estimate of first-quarter growth was almost three percentage points off their most recent and final reading. My point is it will likely be hard to confirm a shift to a persistent\nabove-trend pace of GDP growth even if the second-quarter numbers look relatively good.\nThis experience suggests to me that we can misread the vital signs of the economy in real time. Notwithstanding the mostly positive and encouraging character of recent\ndata, we policymakers need to be circumspect when tempted to drop the gavel and declare the case closed. In the current situation, I feel it's advisable to accrue evidence\nand gain perspective. It will take some time to validate an outlook that assumes above-trend growth and associated solid gains in employment and price stability. I'm sticking\nto the view that conditions that would justify a liftoff decision will arrive in the second half of next year.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

He holds\nto an outlook of continuing growth over the next several quarters at a rate around 3 percent.\nLockhart notes progress in the unemployment rate, but other measures of labor market performance indicate that the economy is still operating well short of full\nemployment. He forecasts inflation to converge to the 2 percent rate over the medium term.\nLockhart believes the Fed's wind-down of asset purchases continues to be appropriate. He continues to be comfortable with a projection of the second half of next year\n(2015) as likely timing for liftoff of the policy interest rate.\n\nI'm pleased to be back in Baton Rouge and to continue to build on the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's partnership with the Graduate School of\nBanking at LSU. The Graduate School of Banking at LSU has worked closely over the last two years with our supervision and regulation staff to put\non banking outlook conferences. In our view, these conferences have been thought-provoking and have achieved a better dialogue between banks\nand regulators.\nI'm also pleased to be back on the campus of LSU. Our research department at the Atlanta Fed partners with the university on local economic\nanalysis.\nHere's what I plan to cover this evening: I'll address the approach of the Federal Reserve to supervision of community banks as well as some of the\nchallenges, as I see them, of operating a community bank. And I'll give you my sense of the economic outlook and the outlook for monetary policy.\nPlease keep in mind that you're hearing my personal views. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and in the Federal Reserve\nSystem, including colleagues principally engaged in supervisory activities, may not fully agree with my views.\nA few weeks ago, Fed Chair Janet Yellen gave a particularly thoughtful speech at the Independent Community Bankers of America policy summit. I think selected highlights\nof her remarks are worth repeating. I'll take the liberty of elaborating on a couple of her points.\nChair Yellen stressed the important role that community banks play in serving Main Street America \"by providing credit to small business owners, homebuyers, households,\nand farmers.\"\nShe devoted much of her speech to the notion of tailored supervision of community banks. She stressed that there is no one-size-fits-all supervision scheme for banks. In\nboth guidance from the Board of Governors and execution of supervisory programs at the Reserve Bank level, the Fed is working to tailor expectations of bank management\nto the size and complexity of the institution.\nBy way of example, we do not intend that community banks be held to the same formal requirements and standards as large banks in regard to stress testing portfolios and\ncapital planning. That said, let me editorialize. Every bank is expected to know the risks in its portfolio and the potential impact on earnings and capital. This may not require,\nhowever, the extent of modeling and scenario planning required of larger banks.\nChair Yellen also commented that the Fed has been monitoring how reliant banks are on short-term wholesale funding. She took care to point out that community banks are\nnot considered a source of potential systemic vulnerability related to wholesale funding.\nIn a summary statement, Chair Yellen reiterated that the Federal Reserve is committed to understanding community banks and their unique challenges.\nWhy so many community bank failures in the Southeast?\nOne way to put those challenges in perspective is by taking a look back at bank failures over the period 2007 through 2013.\nTo tee up this subject, let me show you two slides that depict bank failures in recent history; in particular, the slides show the geographic concentration of bank failures in the\nSoutheast.\nHere you have a heat map of sorts. The horizontal cut is by Federal Reserve District, and the vertical shows the years. The numbers are the total failed banks by year.\n\n\f(enlarge)\n\nThe Atlanta Federal Reserve District covers the entirety of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida and portions of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee.\nThis second slide shows the same information across the United States with some added information on the drivers of individual bank failures in terms of portfolio\ndelinquency concentrations. The key categories are residential acquisition and development loans, mortgages, commercial real estate, and consumer. As you can see, bank\nfailures in the Southeast were mostly concentrated geographically around Atlanta, South Florida, and the panhandle of Florida.\n\n(enlarge)\n\nI don't intend to present here tonight an in-depth analysis of the many factors that contributed to this experience. I simply want to ask—and then try to answer, at a high level\n—the question WHY? Why was it that the banking system in this part of the country was, apparently, especially vulnerable, and what lessons can be drawn from this\nexperience?\nAt the risk of some oversimplification, I'll propose four takeaways.\nFirst, concentrations can be deadly. Many of the banks that failed, especially around Atlanta, were relatively young banks that became highly concentrated in residential real\nestate loans, particularly acquisition, development, and construction, or ADC, loans.\nSecond, many of the banks that failed were excessively reliant on wholesale funding. The median wholesale funding-to-asset ratio of the Georgia banks that failed was 30\npercent. Hot money can burn you.\nAnother factor that contributed to failures was inexperience with severe conditions along with overdependence on collateral values without an understanding of cash flows\nunder various scenarios. I'm a former commercial banker. I was taught that cash generation repays loans, and analysis of the borrower's ability to repay is basic. I've heard\nthe view that a lot of bankers weren't ready for what happened. Their inexperience showed up in lending practices.\nFinally, many of the failed banks suffered from weak governance. Banks need board members who understand their role as directors. Directors as a group set policy, define\nthe risk appetite of the bank, and hold management accountable for risk management. I know most of you here are line bankers. In my opinion, you should welcome a board\nthat challenges management. To perform this role, directors don't necessarily have to be banking experts, but they should be individuals with business acumen.\n\n\fThe current economic context and outlook\nI'll now turn to the here and now and talk about the economic context in which you are currently operating.\nThe recovery began almost five years ago. On the whole, economic growth over this period has been subdued. Up until the middle of last year, growth averaged a little more\nthan 2 percent.\nBut the second half of last year showed a significant step-up in economic activity, with the pace of growth in excess of 3 percent.\nThen came the first quarter of this year. The first-quarter growth rate in the national economy was essentially flat. A new estimate is due Thursday, and it may show a slight\ndecline in activity—that is, contraction of the economy.\nThe view is widely held that the weak first-quarter performance can be explained mostly by bad weather. As one of my contacts put it, the first quarter was wrecked by\nweather. My staff and I ascribe to that view.\nMy going-in forecast for the second quarter was for the economy to resume growth at a run rate similar to that exhibited in the second half of last year—that is, a growth trend\nclose to 3 percent.\nThe March and April data have been consistent with this view. Said differently, looking through the normal month-to-month noisiness of economic data, there are no\nindications that an outlook of 3 percent or better growth through the rest of the year is wildly off base.\nAs you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is tasked with two principal objectives—achievement of full employment and low and stable prices (or low\ninflation). The Committee has defined the desirable rate of consumer price inflation to be 2 percent per annum.\nNeither objective has yet been achieved. That is to say, there is still slack in the employment situation of the country, and inflation is running below the desired rate.\nLet me update where the economy stands opposite these two objectives. Again, these are my personal views.\nWe are making progress on the full employment goal—by some measures, like the rate of civilian unemployment, a lot of progress. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.3\npercent last month and is closing in on levels that many believe to be consistent with a practical definition of full employment. But a number of other measures of labor market\nperformance tell me that the economy is still operating well short of full employment. Notably, there remains an unusually high percentage of prime working-age people who\nare marginally attached to the labor force, who are working part-time jobs when they would prefer to be working full-time, and who are leaving the workforce. These indicators\nand others suggest to me that fulfillment of our employment mandate is still a ways off.\nRegarding inflation, we saw rather broad-based firming of prices in the April Consumer Price Index. It's too early to conclude that the inflation trend is sustainably closer to\ntarget, but the risks associated with disinflation do appear to have receded.\nLooking ahead, I'm holding to an outlook of continuing growth over the next several quarters at a rate around 3 percent. With that, the official unemployment rate should\ndecline and other measures of labor market health should continue to improve. I don't expect dramatic improvement in labor resource utilization, but I do expect steady\nprogress.\nIn the same vein, I'm forecasting inflation to converge to the 2 percent target over the medium term. The inflation and employment objectives connect in the area of wages.\nRecently, we've seen some modest growth of wages, but again it is hard to conclude that the employment gap is very near to being closed.\nI've given you the broad strokes of a pretty optimistic outlook. Such an outlook is supported by anecdotal feedback from many of our business contacts. I would emphasize,\nhowever, that considering the weakness of the first quarter, it's still early in what you might call an assumption-validation process that would serve to confirm that the\neconomy is indeed on the trajectory I've laid out.\nAs confirming evidence, I'll be paying attention to consumer spending and consumer confidence. Data on both have been, on balance, encouraging. I'll be monitoring\nindustrial activity closely. While the manufacturing production numbers stepped down in April following very strong gains in February and March, the April report from\npurchasing managers on production and orders was quite positive. And I'll be looking for sustained employment gains. Payroll jobs growth was at 288,000 in April, and jobs\nhave shown a decided firming since December.\nOn policy\nAchievement of economic progress along the lines of the outlook I've laid out will likely bring about conditions in which higher interest rates will be appropriate. The question\nis when. There is already much talk and speculation among commentators about the timing of \"liftoff\"—the date when the FOMC will begin to move the policy interest rate\nhigher.\nI'm sure you are quite interested in this question. The management of interest-rate risk is a front-and-center concern for banks, a point that we have been emphasizing in our\ninteraction with banks and bank holding companies we supervise.\nI'll conclude with comments on policy considerations, as I see them.\nI believe the wind-down of asset purchases continues to be appropriate. I expect tapering to continue at the pace we've seen since December with the result that the\nquantitative easing, or QE, program will come to a conclusion in the fourth quarter.\nOn the question of the timing of liftoff, let me make a few points.\nAt any given juncture, absolute certainty of the economy's direction is not achievable. As I've suggested, I feel the need to see confirming evidence in the data validating the\nview that above-trend growth is occurring and is sustainable, and that the FOMC is closing in on its policy objectives. One quarter's data isn't enough. I expect it will take a\nnumber of months for me to arrive at conviction on that account.\n\n\fWhen the first move to tighten policy is taken, I would expect it to begin a cycle of gradually rising rates. This will be a significant, even historic, transition that must be\nexecuted skillfully, with tools sufficient to the task, and with clear communication that fosters orderly market adjustment, to the extent possible. The discussion of so-called\npolicy normalization documented in the latest minutes of the FOMC was just a first step, in my opinion.\nIt bears repeating that a discussion of policy normalization does not necessarily imply that a shift in policy is imminent. For the reasons I have discussed, I, as one\npolicymaker, am not in a rush to get to liftoff. I continue to be comfortable with a projection of the second half of next year (2015) as likely timing.\nEven as the economy accelerates this year to a somewhat higher growth trajectory, as I expect, I think continued monetary accommodation will be warranted for some time.\nWhen quantitative easing is done, anticipation of the next policy move will likely intensify. A combination of a shortfall from full utilization of our nation's labor resources and\ninflation below the FOMC's longer-term objective would, in my view, justify patience in raising policy rates.\nOne last comment: You are here participating in continuing education to be the best bankers you can be. The history of bank failures in the Southeast contains a number of\ncautionary lessons. I'll add one more. Improving conditions bring their own challenges. Conditions seem to be improving. Be careful.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThe Global Economy, the U.S. Economy, and the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nDubai, United Arab Emirates\nMay 11, 2014\nKey points\nIn Dubai on May 11, 2014, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart shares his views on the state of and outlook for the global and U.S. economies.\nLockhart notes that the global economy has been gradually recovering with moderate rates of growth and low inflation, but also with significant resource slack in advanced\neconomies.\nLockhart’s U.S. forecast calls for growth accelerating to an annualized rate of around 3 percent. He will be watching for a stronger rate of industrial production growth,\nimproved demand for capital goods, and a step-up in consumer spending.\nLockhart expects the Fed’s asset purchase program to be completely phased out by later this year, and says economic conditions will justify beginning to raise interest\nrates in the latter half of 2015.\nLockhart believes that changes in U.S. financial conditions affect interest rates and asset prices in other countries through various channels, but feels that overall emerging\nmarket vulnerability to external causes is considerably lower than it has been in the past.\nLockhart notes risks to his outlook in terms of U.S. economic growth momentum, geopolitical events, and financial instability, but is not overly concerned that markets or\ninstitutions pose broad systemic risks at this time.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to return to this part of the world. I’m on a bit of a nostalgia tour. I began my career 42 years ago in the Middle East and spent a total\nof seven years here. I have very fond memories of my experience in the region.\nToday, I will offer my views on the state of and outlook for both the global economy and the U.S. economy, and will explain the current position of\nthe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. And, given the weight of the U.S. economy and the importance of the dollar in global economic affairs, I will\ncomment on how Fed policy affects the rest of the world, particularly emerging markets. I will also comment on the future risks and explain how\nfinancial stability concerns factor into my thinking on policy.\nPlease note that I am speaking only for myself. My views may not be shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. I am here at the\ninvitation of the U.S. Department of Treasury and Department of State. However, I am not speaking for these arms of the U.S. government, and\nthey, too, may not agree with the views I will express today.\nGlobal economy\nLet me start with a look at the global economy. The financial crisis of 2007 to 2008 affected the entire globe, and the ensuing recession in the United States was mirrored by\nweak or stagnant conditions in most of the advanced economies. Many of the major emerging-market economies performed relatively well in the years immediately following\nthe recession—2009 to 2011—before slowing more recently. Overall, it’s been a slow process of recovery for much of the world.\nThe slow recovery has been supported by very accommodative monetary policies in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Interest rates remain quite low. Said differently,\nthe global cost of credit has remained unusually low. Monetary policy decisions are rarely coordinated among the major central banks today, but widespread weak economic\nconditions have dictated similar policies in the advanced countries, to be sure. Some aspects of monetary policy have been quite unconventional. I’m referring, of course, to\nthe measures taken in the United States and Japan when short-term interest rates could not be pushed any lower. The world knows these policies as “quantitative easing.”\nI believe that highly accommodative monetary policies have met with some success. However, the advanced economies still face large shortfalls in economic performance,\nas evidenced by still unsatisfactory levels of underemployment. Inflation in advanced economies has firmed a little lately, but remains low and below the targeted run rates of\nmany central banks. Persistent low inflation has raised concerns of tipping into deflationary conditions, but at a global level, this outcome has not materialized, in part due to\nthe extraordinary policies of the world’s central banks.\nRecently, the circumstances of some emerging markets have become less settled. Some emerging markets have experienced capital outflows, triggered in part by the\nwinding down of extraordinary policy accommodation in the United States. A number of countries have had spells of volatility in their financial and currency markets. There\nare persistent concerns about emerging-market fundamentals, especially in countries dealing with high inflation and wide current-account deficits.\nTo generalize, however, the global economy has been enjoying a gradual recovery with moderate rates of growth and low inflation, but also significant resource slack in\nadvanced economies.\nU.S. economy\nThe U.S. economy is my primary focus as a central banker, and the condition of the U.S. economy is very important in a global context, so let me spend a few minutes talking\nabout how I see economic developments there. Since the middle of last year, the U.S. economy appears to have entered a higher growth path, although the preliminary data\nfor the first quarter were much weaker than expected. After two quarters of growth above 3 percent (annualized), the quarter ended March 31 showed practically no growth at\nall.\n\n\fThe Bureau of Economic Analysis released an advance estimate of only 0.1 percent growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of 2014.\nUnusually harsh winter weather seems to have been a significant factor in the disappointing first-quarter growth. Businesspeople have noted, for example, weather-related\nlosses in production, retail sales, shipment time, workdays on construction sites, and visits to hotels and restaurants.\nStatistically, the drop-off in real GDP growth in the first quarter mostly reflected downturns in exports and capital spending, a decline in private inventory investment, and\nslower government spending.\nThe softness of the first quarter naturally raises concerns that the economy has lost momentum. Many forecasters, including Federal Reserve forecasters, are treating the\nfirst quarter as a temporary phenomenon with few, if any, longer-term implications. To generalize, forecasters and businesspeople alike are expecting a rebound in the\nsecond quarter and beyond. Most observers of the U.S. economy are optimistic that real growth will snap back to a pace of around 3 percent per annum.\nI share that outlook. My official forecast calls for growth accelerating starting this quarter to an annualized run rate around 3 percent. I expect stronger growth will help absorb\nunderutilized resources in the economy, especially labor resources.\nA week ago Friday, we got the latest employment report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The trend in payroll jobs creation was quite encouraging. Also, the official\nunemployment rate fell by a surprising four-tenths of a percent to 6.3 percent, but with the April number, the labor force participation rate fell again to almost a 30-year low. In\nsimple terms, last month, the United States apparently added jobs but lost workers. So I am hesitant to take on board this decline in the unemployment rate as indisputable\nevidence of progress toward full employment.\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve, through the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, conducts monetary policy with two primary objectives in mind. One\nobjective is to support full utilization of labor resources, or full employment. The other objective is to maintain price stability, or low (but not dangerously low) inflation. The\nFOMC has chosen to define price stability in terms of a targeted rate of inflation of 2 percent over the longer term.\nConsistent with my view that the economic growth rate will improve, I expect inflation to firm to a healthier rate over the medium term on a track to the FOMC's 2 percent\ntarget. There are some signs of firming in recent data.\nHowever, it may not be clear for several months, or even quarters, whether the U.S. economy is undeniably on a stronger and sustained growth path around a run rate of 3\npercent. To gauge the true extent of economic expansion, I will be watching for a stronger rate of industrial production growth, improved demand for capital goods, and a\nstep-up in consumer spending.\nU.S. monetary policy\nLet me now take a few minutes to discuss the Federal Reserve’s policy stance in light of the outlook I’ve laid out (which, I might add, is pretty mainstream among Federal\nReserve and private forecasters).\nAs you know, the Fed is winding down its asset purchase program, commonly known as “quantitative easing,” or QE. Starting last December, the Fed reduced its monthly\npurchases from $85 billion a month to the current level of $45 billion. I expect this program to be completely phased out by October or December this year.\nIn my view, this is a first step in the gradual normalization of monetary policy. Assuming continued recovery of the U.S. economy and the closing of employment and inflation\ngaps, the Fed’s policy interest rate would begin to rise at some point next year.\nFor now, the policy rate remains near zero, and the FOMC has indicated through its published statements its intention to keep policy rates low for a while longer.\nBased on my outlook, I think that conditions in the U.S. economy will justify beginning the process of raising rates in the latter half of 2015. Once rates begin to rise, I expect\nthe process to normalization of interest rates to be gradual.\nEffects of U.S. monetary policy worldwide\nThe world watches U.S. monetary policy closely, and global capital flows are influenced by expectations of Federal Reserve policy. Recent turbulence in certain emerging\nmarkets led to substantial controversy over the effect of U.S. policy on the rest of the world.\nQuestions were raised about the wisdom and timing of the Fed’s decision to start withdrawing the extraordinary support provided by quantitative easing and the decision to\ndo so seemingly without regard to the effect on other countries.\nI’ll give you my perspective as one U.S. policymaker. Changes in U.S. financial conditions do affect interest rates and asset prices in other countries through various\nchannels. U.S. central-bank policy influences capital flows and their effects, in turn, on the foreign exchange rate, equity markets and debt markets, both external and\ndomestic.\nAs a result, some emerging economies may face pressures when U.S. monetary accommodation is reduced. They may have to make policy and business adjustments. This\nwas the situation earlier this year, but since then conditions in most affected countries have stabilized or at least calmed.\nStepping back, my sense is that overall emerging market vulnerability to external causes is considerably lower than it has been in the past. Many emerging-market\npolicymakers responded to the financial crises in Asia and Latin America in the late 1990s and early 2000s by moving to flexible currencies, building official reserves, and\ncutting their dependence on foreign currency borrowing.\nThe Fed has tried to be transparent about the direction of its monetary policy. In my view, we have communicated clearly our intention to wind down asset purchases and\neventually begin to raise rates as the U.S. recovery advances and our policy objectives look more attainable. These contingencies should have been clear even before last\nsummer when the subject of phasing out the asset purchase program was broached in a Fed press conference.\nI believe it is in the world’s interest that the U.S. economy strengthens and that the Federal Reserve pursues policies appropriate for, and supportive of, improving conditions.\nAlso, with my expectation that the United States will experience better economic growth over the medium term, I believe the outlook for emerging economies is also\n\n\fimproved.\nRisks\nI have presented a rather upbeat outlook for the U.S. economy. I have to acknowledge some risks to my outlook. Risks can express themselves in a number of ways, but at\npresent I see the risks falling under three headings. First, as I said, it may be a while before we know if the intrinsic growth momentum of the U.S. economy is indeed as\nstrong as I’m projecting.\nSecond, there is the risk of financial instability. In a highly integrated global financial system, events almost anywhere can have an impact on financial stability in the United\nStates, here in the Middle East, and elsewhere. To take a U.S.-centric view, given how long a low-interest-rate environment has been in place, it’s wise to keep a close watch\non asset markets for signs of “irrational exuberance,” a phrase coined by former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. I can assure you Fed policymakers are monitoring\ndevelopments carefully. As one policymaker, I am not overly concerned that markets or institutions pose broad systemic risks at this time.\nThe third area of concern is geopolitical in nature. Tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine have an economic dimension, both in the interplay between the\nparties and the potential for destabilization of markets and economies. Even in the absence of significant direct exposure (which is the case for the United States), I think\nthere is risk that heightened conflict could produce volatility in global financial and commodity markets that, if prolonged, could spill over to the U.S. and global economies.\nThe recent lessening of tensions is a welcome development.\nConclusion\nIn my comments today, I’ve tried to provide a summary perspective on the economic circumstances of the day that I think affect us all. I learned early in my career that\ngeographic location influences a person’s perspective—where you sit often determines where you stand. I’m pretty certain the world looks somewhat different to you from\nhere, and that what you think is important may not have been covered in my remarks. So, I welcome now your comments and questions.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

Miami has made quite a comeback from the recession's depths in 2008 and 2009. It's nice to\nvisit a city that's enjoying such a strong rebound.\nI attribute that to Miami's unique position as a true international city and, of course, to collaborative leadership. I have some firsthand knowledge.\nYour chamber president, Al Dosal, also serves on our Miami Branch board. Thank you, Al, for your enthusiastic service.\nThere is an expression that seems especially apt as we watch events in the Ukraine. It is \"geography is destiny.\" In a quarter that's seen hard-hitting\nweather events across most of the country, South Florida was spared.\nI believe weather effects have been meaningful in the national economy in the quarter just ended. I'll elaborate on that point in my remarks today.\nHere's what I plan to cover today: I'll give you my sense of where the economy stands at this juncture and where it's headed. I'll argue that there\nremains a considerable amount of economic slack, especially in the utilization of labor resources.\nGiven my view on how economic conditions are likely to evolve, I will argue that monetary policy should remain quite accommodative for some time. To be even more\nprecise, any uptick in the policy rate is unlikely to be warranted until at least the last half of next year. I will provide a sense of how I am assessing economic progress toward\nthe Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) goals and provide my view on developments that could lead to a revision of that general timeline.\nI have to emphasize that what follows are my personal opinions. My colleagues on the FOMC and in the Federal Reserve System may not agree.\nThe economy's current position and outlook\nFirst-quarter growth of gross domestic product (GDP) was weak on a number of counts following two quarters of relative strength. It will be many weeks before we have a\nfinal and conclusive number, but tracking estimates indicate that overall growth in the first three months of this year was below 2 percent on an annualized basis.\nWeather seems to have been a significant factor in the disappointing first-quarter growth. In our contacts with business people across the Southeast, we heard accounts of\nweather-related losses in production, retail sales, shipment time, work days on construction sites, and visits to hotels and restaurants.\nDepending on industry, some of our contacts expect the lost activity to be made up in coming weeks while others expect activity to resume only to normal levels.\nAs convincing as these anecdotal accounts of weather effects may be, the softness of the first quarter naturally raises concerns that the economy has lost momentum here in\nthe early part of the year. Forecasters, including Federal Reserve forecasters, have to decide if the economy is likely to continue on this weak growth path or if the first\nquarter will turn out to be just a one-off spell of weaker performance.\nI am in the latter camp. My key working assumption is that growth will accelerate in the second quarter and repeat in subsequent quarters. I expect stronger growth will help\nto absorb underutilized resources in the economy, especially labor resources.\nMonetary policy objectives\nMy baseline forecast—just explained—is central to my view on the appropriateness of current monetary policy.\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve through the FOMC runs monetary policy with two primary objectives in mind. One objective is to support full utilization of labor\nresources, or full employment. The other objective is to maintain price stability, or low (but not too low) inflation. The FOMC has chosen to define price stability in terms of a\ntargeted rate of inflation of 2 percent over the longer term.\n\n\fConsistent with my belief that the economic growth rate will rise, unemployment will decline, and resource slack in the economy will shrink, I expect inflation to firm to a\nhealthier rate over the medium term on a track to the FOMC's 2 percent target.\nI want to spend some time describing how I think about monetary policy decision making in light of the ambiguity caused by first-quarter weakness. But before laying out my\nown framework for assessing the economy's true trend in coming months, let me refresh your understanding of the current state of the Fed's monetary policy.\nThe FOMC is currently using two instruments to implement its policy. One instrument is the program we refer to as large-scale asset purchases—what is often called\n\"quantitative easing,\" or QE. The other is communication about how long the Committee intends to maintain the key federal funds rate target at its present near-zero level.\nWe refer to this policy tool as \"forward guidance.\"\nAs you know, quantitative easing is being wound down. Through all of 2013, the Fed used its power of money creation to fund the purchase of mortgage-backed securities\nand Treasury securities in the amount of $85 billion per month.\nIn December, the FOMC took the first step to phase out this program. At the past three meetings, the monthly pace of purchases was reduced by $10 billion. Today, the level\nof monthly purchases stands at $55 billion. At this pace, purchases will drop to zero in October or December.\nI support the continued phase-out of the asset purchase program. Growth has improved and the unemployment rate has fallen since the start of the latest round of QE. My\nassessment of the underlying momentum of the economy leads me to the view that the FOMC's forward guidance will adequately support ongoing progress toward the\nCommittee's objectives.\nThrough forward guidance, the FOMC has indicated its intention to keep policy rates low for some time to come. I think this accommodative policy is right for the current\ncircumstances. My forecast of continued improvement in GDP growth, labor market conditions, and inflation is predicated on the continued support of accommodative\nmonetary policy. Furthermore, I think we are still some distance from full employment and a comfortable zone of inflation.\nWith our asset purchases tapering on a pretty predictable course, it is understandable that the focus has jumped ahead to the question of when the FOMC begins the\nprocess of \"liftoff\" of the federal funds target from the zero floor. Anticipation is a feature of monetary policy, not a bug. The essence of forward guidance is communication\nabout the conditions that would make policymakers change course.\nIt is very difficult, and ultimately undesirable, to link such conditions with a precise date. The use of forward guidance does require that policymakers articulate as clearly as\nthey can about how they are assessing economic conditions in formulating their views on appropriate monetary policy. In that way, the public can align their expectations with\npolicy intentions.\nMy approach for assessing progress\nSo let me lay out my approach for assessing progress as the economy moves along in the coming months. Understand that this is just one policymaker's thinking, not the\nCommittee's.\nFirst, my view is that sustained GDP growth in the neighborhood of 3 percent will generate sufficient movement toward the FOMC's objectives to justify a gradual liftoff in\npolicy rates sometime in the latter half of 2015.\nBut, if that progress fails to materialize, a later liftoff date than I am assuming will likely be appropriate.\nIt is important to note that pickup in GDP growth is not a goal in and of itself. As I have indicated, I am looking to this pickup because I believe it will be sufficient to produce\nlabor market and inflation outcomes that align with the FOMC's mandated objectives. So direct assessment of labor market and inflation developments is also critical.\nUnder ideal circumstances, we might be able to gauge the momentum of the economy using just a couple of economic statistics. For example, we might look mostly at the\nofficial civilian unemployment rate and the most recent 12-month trend growth rate of the price index of personal consumption expenditures (PCE). These indicators normally\nwork pretty well. But in the complicated environment that emerged in the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession, a more comprehensive approach to assessing\neconomic conditions is warranted.\nIndeed, I like to think in terms of a dashboard of indicators to help me gauge how close we are to full employment and price stability.\nMy staff at the Atlanta Fed has developed a labor conditions tracking tool based on a broad set of labor market indicators. Taken as a package, these indicators will help me\nassess progress toward full utilization of labor resources over coming quarters.\nFor example, in addition to the standard unemployment rate, I look at broader measures of unemployment that factor in marginally attached workers—people available and\nwanting a job but not currently looking for a job. Their numbers are about 1 million more today than before the Great Recession.\nAnother underutilized group are those working part-time but who claim they want full-time employment. They currently represent about 5 percent of the labor force, and that's\nan unusually high number relative to the official unemployment rate. We would clearly like to see an increase in the flow of these workers from part-time to full-time work.\nThe headline unemployment rate we are all familiar with is the U-3 statistic generated by the government. It currently stands at 6.7 percent. A more inclusive measure of\nunemployment that factors in the marginally attached and those who are involuntarily working part-time is called U-6. This measure is currently calculated as 12.6 percent.\nI'll be looking for two developments: an absolute drop in both the official and broader U-6 measures of unemployment over the coming months, but also a tightening of the\ngap between them. The good news is that over the past six months the difference between these two measures of unemployment has in fact been narrowing.\nMeasures of labor market turnover also help me gauge improving conditions. These give me indications of increased hiring by firms, and also of increased confidence of\nworkers willing to move on to better jobs. Progress along these dimensions has been very slow, and the rate of hires and quits remains well below prerecession levels.\n\n\fOne other important indicator is wages. Wage growth by most measures has been very low. I take this as a signal of labor market weakness, and in turn a signal of a lack of\nsignificant upward unit cost pressure on inflation.\nLabor compensation growth is at the heart of the connection between labor market conditions and inflation, so wage growth would also be a key indicator on my inflation\ndashboard.\nIn fact, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta maintains an \"inflation dashboard\" of 30 monthly indicators of inflation that I find useful in summarizing broad inflationary\ndevelopments.\nWith this dashboard as general guide, I will be watching for gradually stronger pricing power by firms as evidenced in a number of retail price measures.\nI would also hope to see a modest firming in commodity prices as global industrial activity improves.\nAnd I will be checking to make sure that the key measures of inflation expectations remain steady.\nConclusion\nAlthough my labor conditions dashboard shows signs of improvement, progress toward full employment has been very gradual and uneven when viewed from a broad\nperspective. With respect to inflation, the broad view has yet to suggest a clear movement back in the direction of the FOMC's 2 percent goal. So I believe the FOMC is still\nsignificantly short of achieving its two mandated objectives.\nLet me sum up. At the Atlanta Fed, my staff and I are in a period of collecting data in support of our baseline assumptions. We are assuming a resumption of growth\napproaching 3 percent in the second quarter and beyond. We assume the first quarter was weak mostly because of weather. We will know if our assumptions on that score\nare wrong relatively soon. Validation of our medium-term outlook, including progress on employment and inflation, may take a little longer.\nThe main instrument of monetary policy is forward guidance about the path of interest-rate policy and the conditions that will justify liftoff. If our assumptions are invalidated\nby incoming data, I think we will have to alter guidance. But based on my working medium-term outlook, I see the latter half of 2015 as the likely time frame for the first move\nto higher rates.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • 2013 Annual Report, Unemployment section • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThe Challenge of Estimating Full Employment\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nTanous Lecture, Georgetown University\nWashington, DC\nMarch 6, 2014\nKey points\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a March 6 lecture at Georgetown University, talks about the challenge of estimating full employment.\nIn Lockhart's view, the current stance of monetary policy appropriately aligns with the outlook, and the Federal Reserve's asset purchase program will continue winding\ndown.\nLockhart believes the real question is when the Fed's policy interest rate, now near zero, will begin to rise.\nLockhart reiterates that inflation and employment are both well short of goal.\nThe current official unemployment rate of 6.6 percent may overstate the overall health of employment conditions, Lockhart says.\nLockhart says that to get close to full employment would involve substantial absorption of the shadow labor force—those who are not working but also not counted in the\nstandard unemployment rate.\nLockhart stresses that a careful evaluation of the employment situation suggests that full employment is still a ways off, and continued monetary accommodation is\nnecessary.\n\nToday I will explore the challenge of estimating full employment and the implications for monetary policy. To give you a roadmap of my remarks, I\nwill start with an assessment of current economic conditions here in the first quarter of 2014. I will follow that by laying out my outlook for full year\n2014 and the early months of 2015.\nIt is axiomatic in monetary policy that the stance of policy should fit (be appropriate for) the outlook. I will explain the current position of policy and\ngive you my opinion of its appropriateness. I'll then discuss the questions about the direction of policy that are on the public mind and the mind of\nfinancial market participants.\nI will argue that the most important question is the timing of the first increase in the Fed's policy interest rate. And I will share my framework for\nthinking about that decision.\nIn my thinking, there are two dominant and equal considerations in the decision to raise interest rates. They are, in shorthand, inflation and\nemployment. I plan, in these remarks, to give most attention to employment (or, more to the point, full employment). And I will argue that there remains considerable slack in\nthe country's employment situation.\nSome might add a third consideration—financial stability. I will touch on that subject but treat it as an ever-present, ever-pertinent contextual requirement.\nAs you follow my line of thinking this evening, please remember that you're hearing my personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. My colleagues may not see things the way I do.\nCurrent economic conditions\nThe recession ended and the recovery began in the summer of 2009. For the first four years of recovery, gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged just over 2.0\npercent. In the second half of 2013, however, the economy appeared to pick up momentum. Growth in the third and fourth quarters of last year averaged 3.25 percent\n(annualized).\nWe entered 2014 with high hopes that the economy would continue to experience a phase of accelerated growth that might be sustained for some time. Many forecasters,\nincluding those at a number of the Federal Reserve Banks, foresaw growth in 2014 around 3.0 percent.\nSince then, the economic indicators have been mixed, but generally softer than expected. Overall consumer spending rose strongly in January, but was heavily concentrated\nin home utility expenditures—power consumption—as colder-than-usual weather hit many regions of the country.\nAuto sales, which were strong in 2013, slowed sharply at year-end and early in 2014. Likewise, home sales and housing starts have fallen off since last fall.\nFinally, industrial activity has slowed quite a bit since last October, following a mid-2013 surge. There was a pronounced decline in manufacturing production in January.\nSurvey data on factory orders in February show a modest increase.\nFor each of these data points, bad weather is thought to have had a significant, adverse influence on the reported number. Indeed, my research staff estimates that real GDP\ngrowth in the first quarter may have been reduced by about three-fourths percentage point (annualized) due to bad weather. I've seen roughly similar estimates from other\nsources, though I think all of these estimates are necessarily more impressionistic than precise.\n\n\fI think we could see an uptick in activity in the second quarter as business activity rebounds and some catch-up in sales and production occurs. If this is the case, forecasts\nof stronger growth in line with the second half of last year may still play out.\nThe alternative view, however, is that this quarter signals incipient renewed weakness—another false dawn. There is some ambiguity around the current state of the\neconomy.\nOutlook\nIn my personal outlook for 2014 and the beginning months of 2015, I am holding to an optimistic outlook. By \"optimistic,\" I mean I expect a resumption of growth after the soft\nfirst quarter closer to a 3.0 percent annual pace. That rate of growth should bring continuing solid employment gains and a healthier economy in general, including a healthier\nrate of inflation.\nAs I said, current conditions are ambiguous. Why am I not succumbing to doubts, you might ask? Because, in my view, the economy's fundamentals are stronger, and the\nheadwinds that have buffeted the economy and restrained growth are weaker.\nLet me expand on my claim that the economy's fundamentals are stronger. I think basic conditions in several key sectors of the economy are much improved compared with\nearlier in the recovery period. I would cite banking, housing, energy, and manufacturing as examples.\nHousehold balance sheets are much healthier now thanks to reduced debt, higher saving, and stronger asset prices, including higher home values.\nBusiness and financial-system leverage has been significantly reduced from levels precrisis that were demonstrated to be unsustainable. Business profitability is good, and\nfirm balance sheets are generally liquid.\nLikewise, fiscal imbalances, while not solved for the long term, are somewhat less a near-term concern.\nFinally, employment markets are unquestionably in a better state compared to even a year ago.\nAt the same time, certain headwinds that have persistently buffeted the economy and restrained growth appear to have lessened. The fiscal drag associated with federal\ngovernment budget austerity measures has eased. The risk of another financial meltdown emanating from Europe seems to have receded. Concerns about European\nsovereign debt and the exposure of the European banking system were an important source of uncertainty that weighed heavily on business confidence in the years 2011\nand 2012, for instance.\nThat said, we live in a world where change can come quickly. At the moment, the Ukraine situation is front of mind. The situation presents some risk, particularly to Europe.\nDisruption of the European economy could spill over to our own in some measure. The situation calls for close monitoring of developments.\nMore broadly, slowing growth in certain emerging market economies—a potential headwind—bears watching.\nStepping back, though, my overall assessment is that conditions have significantly improved.\nPolicy stance\nIn my view, the current stance of the Committee's policy appropriately aligns with this outlook. In December, the Committee made the decision to begin tapering its program\nof asset purchases. The level of monthly purchases now stands at $65 billion, down from $85 billion.\nThe foundational policy instrument—the target for the federal funds rate—remains near zero. The policy rate has been as low as it can go for more than five years.\nImportantly, the Committee has communicated through what is called \"forward guidance\" that interest-rate policy is likely to stay put for a while longer. So, in spite of the\nphasing out of asset purchases, the intended overall position of policy is \"highly accommodative.\" I think this is appropriate and needed.\nThis is where we are today as regards policy. The public—including, importantly, participants in financial markets—is focused at the moment on two questions about the\ncourse of policy. The public wants to know under what conditions might the Committee reverse course on tapering—either pause the wind-down of purchases or actually\nincrease the monetary stimulus that asset purchases aim to deliver. There is a high bar to reversing course, in my opinion. That is certainly my position. Unless the economy\ntakes a major turn for the worse or a spell of intense disinflation develops, I expect the program to be completely wound down by the end of the year.\nThe second question—in my mind the more salient of the two—is the timing of \"liftoff.\" Liftoff is the date when the policy rate, and presumably all interest rates, will begin to\nrise.\nIn my bank's official forecast, we are putting liftoff in the back half of 2015.\nKey considerations in a liftoff decision\nNow I want to frame for you how I, as one policymaker, am thinking about the liftoff decision.\nI think there are two key considerations that should affect the timing of liftoff. They are inflation and employment. Inflation (sometimes called price stability) and employment\n(expressed as maximum employment) have been assigned to the Fed by Congress as the primary objectives of monetary policy. They are captured in the so-called dual\nmandate.\nI want to spend most of my remaining time talking about the employment side of our mandate, but let me comment briefly on inflation.\nIn January 2012, the Fed established a formal inflation target of 2 percent. The official time horizon for achieving this target was stated as \"over the longer run.\" It says \"over\nthe longer run\"—which I take to mean most of the time—not \"in the long run,\" which I would translate as \"eventually.\" Two percent over the longer run is the Fed's notion of a\nhealthy rate of inflation and our definition of price stability.\n\n\fToday, inflation is running well below the 2 percent target. The January headline Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index showed inflation at 1.2 percent for the last\n12 months. The 12-month rate for the core PCE index (which excludes volatile food and energy prices) was 1.1 percent. There has not been much movement in the rate of\ninflation for several months. At the moment, it does not seem to be moving higher. Business contacts tell me they have very little, if any, pricing power.\nThe Committee would like to see the inflation rate rise to 2 percent over the coming many months. In my official forecast, I am projecting just this as a by-product of a\nsustained quicker pace of growth. In my view, the unhealthy low run rate of inflation justifies continuing monetary stimulus.\nThere are times when accelerating inflation might require putting the brakes on monetary stimulus. That is not the case now. Our inflation objective and full employment\nobjective are not in conflict. They are complementary objectives. So, I will now turn to the second consideration in a liftoff decision, the outlook for achieving full or maximum\nemployment.\nAchieving sustainable full employment\nThe current official level of unemployment is 6.6 percent. More than a year ago, the Committee set out a threshold of 6.5 percent as a criterion for beginning to consider a\nrate hike. Later, the Committee updated its rate guidance with a statement that it expects the policy rate to remain at its current level \"well past\" achievement of 6.5 percent.\nGiven that measured unemployment is so close to 6.5 percent, the time is approaching for a refreshed explanation of how unemployment or broader employment conditions\nare to be factored into a liftoff decision. In my mind, this requires a revisiting of what constitutes full employment.\nDefining full employment is a harder question than answering whether we are close to achieving such a state.\nIf all we had to go on was the official unemployment rate, we might think we are rapidly approaching full utilization of the nation's labor resources. There has been a\nsignificant decline in the unemployment rate. It was 10 percent at its peak and nearly 8 percent at the beginning of last year. As I said, it's 6.6 percent today. We get an\nupdated number tomorrow.\nI think the current official unemployment rate may overstate the overall health of and progress achieved in employment conditions. As you may be aware, the interpretation of\nfalling unemployment has been complicated by a decline in participation in the workforce.\nLet me explain what it means to be a participant in the workforce. The data used to construct the unemployment rate come from a survey of households conducted by the\nCensus Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To be counted as a participant in the labor force, a respondent must give rather specific qualifying answers to questions in\nthe survey. To be counted as a member of the labor force—and, therefore, to be counted in the calculation of the official unemployment rate—respondents have to indicate\nthat they were either working or available to work in the previous month. Evidence of availability for work is the claim to have actively sought employment in that month.\nOtherwise, they are not in the labor force.\nThe Census Bureau gets a variety of answers to its questions. Some people say they do not want a job. Others say they are available for work but have not looked for\nemployment in the last month. Some who are counted as employed say they are working part time but would like a full-time job.\nThose who are available, have looked for work in the past year, but have not recently looked for work are labeled \"marginally attached.\" They are not in the official labor\nforce, so they are not officially unemployed. You might say they are a \"shadow labor force.\"\nThe makeup of the class of marginally attached workers is quite fluid. About 40 percent of the marginally attached in any given month join the official labor force in the\nsubsequent month. But only about 10 percent of those who move into the labor force find a job right away. In effect, they went from unofficially unemployed to officially\nunemployed. I think there is a strong case for assuming that at least a fraction of the marginally attached should be treated as unemployed even though they don't show up in\nthe standard measure of unemployment.\nLet me insert here a short tutorial on the hierarchy of unemployment measures published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There are six levels—U-1 through U-6, each with\nits own technical definition that includes or excludes categories of workers. The official headline unemployment rate (which stands today at 6.6 percent) is U-3. One measure\nthat counts the marginally attached in the pool of the unemployed is U-6.\nU-6 also includes working people who identify themselves as working \"part time for economic reasons.\" These are people who want to work full time (defined as 35 hours or\nmore) but are able only to get fewer than 35 hours of work. In official employment statistics, these part-time workers count equally with full-time workers. In my view, people\nwho work part time for economic reasons might be thought of as partially unemployed. And among those \"economic reasons\" might be that the economy, in spite of recent\ngrowth, is not yet strong enough to close the actual, even if not fully measured, employment gap.\nHere's my point: what U-6 captures matters. Measures such as marginally attached and part time for economic reasons became elevated in the recession and have not\ncome down materially. Said differently, broader measures of unemployment like U-6 suggest that a significant level of slack remains in our employment markets.\nSo what's going on with the marginally attached, and even some of the completely detached?\nThe health of the labor market clearly affects decisions of individuals to enroll in school, apply for disability insurance benefits, or stay home to take care of house or family.\nDiscouragement over job prospects rose during the Great Recession, causing many unemployed people to drop out of the labor force and others not to enter it. People make\na participation choice based on their sense—from what they hear—of employment prospects, the costs associated with going to work (for example, commuting costs,\nchildcare, elder care, housekeeping), and the feasibility of alternatives to work (perhaps school or part-time tasks compensated in cash). People are well-attuned to\nincentives and disincentives and their opportunity costs. Individuals make personal calculations in answer to the question, am I (or are we as a household) net better off if I go\nto work? I'd argue that the responses of people in the surveys that determine the data are not independent of prevailing economic conditions. If the economy were hitting on\nall cylinders, many people would give different answers.\nAs a policymaker, I am concerned about the unemployed in the official labor force, but I am also concerned about the unemployed in the shadow labor force. To get close to\nfull employment, as I think of it, would involve substantial absorption of this shadow labor force. I do not think we're near that point yet. This is one of the reasons I support\ncontinuing with a highly accommodative policy and deferring liftoff for a while longer.\n\n\fFinancial stability\nEarlier, I drew your attention to the two objectives of the Fed's dual mandate as key considerations in a liftoff decision. Before closing, let me draw your attention to a related\nconsideration that could influence a liftoff decision. That is financial stability, or the risk of financial instability.\nFinancial stability can be viewed as a factor that is closely allied with our statutorily mandated objectives. A spell of financial instability, if severe enough, could be a spoiler in\nthe Fed's pursuit of stable prices and full employment through its accommodative policy stance.\nThe first line of defense would most likely be use of the tools of macroprudential supervision of banks and the financial system. But, speaking for myself of course, I don't\ncompletely rule out a situation in which emerging threats would influence the stance of policy.\nSince I'm here at Georgetown, I'll mention my colleague Governor Dan Tarullo (who also has a Georgetown connection, having been a law professor downtown), who\nrecently addressed the pertinent role of financial stability concerns in our policymaking. He said, \"[I]ncorporating financial stability considerations into monetary policy\ndecisions need not imply the creation of an additional mandate for monetary policy. The potentially huge effect on price stability and employment associated with bouts of\nserious financial instability gives ample justification.\"\nConclusion\nLet me sum up. Current economic conditions are ambiguous, but I believe that after a weak first quarter, the economy will resume growing at the accelerated pace seen in\nthe second half of 2013. I believe the fundamentals are stronger, and headwinds that previously restrained growth have diminished. The current stance of monetary policy—\nthe ultra-low policy interest rate accompanied by the wind-down of the asset purchase program—is right for the outlook and the remaining work to be done.\nThe pivotal question in terms of policy is when it will be appropriate for the Fed to raise the policy interest rate. To answer that question, I look to the state of inflation and\nemployment. I would argue that both are well short of goal. The employment goal is expressed as full employment. Even with the progress made to date, a careful evaluation\nof the employment situation suggests to me that full employment is still a ways off, and continued monetary accommodation is necessary.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart's biography • PDF version • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

The FOMC would like the ongoing rate of inflation to move\ncloser to 2 percent.\nAlso, labor market indicators show a qualitative weakness underlying the quantitative progress associated with the drop in the unemployment rate.\nLockhart stresses that the basic stance of Fed policy will remain highly accommodative until well past the 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold. In other words, the\nFOMC will not raise the federal funds rate for some time.\nLockhart says that the FOMC's focus on \"forward guidance\" about the direction of rate policy reflects its increasing importance as a policy tool.\nThe Atlanta Fed's official forecast expects the liftoff of the policy rate in the second half of 2015, and Lockhart remains comfortable with that forecast.\n\nI've been worrying about speaking in Macon for several weeks now. A few weeks ago, I was witness to a most amazing concert in Atlanta that\ninvolved musicians with Macon connections. Chuck Leavell was the organizer and lead performer of a night of rip-roaring southern rock that\nincluded Robert McDuffie, the superb concert violinist whose conservatory is here at Mercer University; Gregg Allman of the Allman Brothers; and\nthe Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. One of the most-appreciated numbers was Chuck Leavell's rendition of \"Low Down Dirty Dog.\" You should've\nbeen there. Since then, I've been worrying about my gig here—a central banker talking about the economy and monetary policy. Will you tell your\nfriends \"you should've been there\"? Or, maybe, \"you should've been there to hear that low down dirty dog from the Federal Reserve.\"\nWell, the pressure's on, I guess. Here's my playlist for this afternoon: I plan to talk about the country's current economic situation and the outlook for\n2014. I'll describe the positioning of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC's) current monetary policy in relation to the outlook. And I will\nspend quite a bit of my time discussing the FOMC's \"forward guidance\" about interest rate policy. My focus on forward guidance reflects its growing\nimportance as a policy tool of the Fed. Indeed, we're now in a period in which effective communication between your central bank and the public,\nincluding participants in financial markets, presents heightened challenges for us policymakers. I'll elaborate on that point in my remarks.\nAs always, my comments are my personal views and may not reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the FOMC.\nThe economic situation and outlook\nLet me begin with my views on the current state of the economy and the outlook. The economy seemed to move to a higher growth track in the second half of 2013. As the\ndata now stand (we do not yet have the final number for the fourth quarter), the economy expanded in the second half at an annual rate of 3.6 percent. This is the current\nestimate of real GDP (gross domestic product) growth—that is, growth net of inflation. That is about 1 1/2 percentage points above the economy's average growth since the\nend of the recession.\nMixed incoming data on economic activity in December and January have raised concerns about whether the economy has traction at this faster growth pace. There appears\nto have been a slowdown. Weather effects may very well have dampened retail sales, auto sales, housing starts, manufacturing activity, and of course transportation, among\nothers. Weather is also likely to affect the February unemployment report, which we'll receive on March 7.\nAs a result, the current quarter is difficult to read as an indication of the most likely story for the full year 2014 and first part of 2015. The recent mixed data could be just a\ntemporary thing—as the weather explanation suggests—or something more fundamental going on. While I am tracking the numbers carefully, at the moment I think it's too\nearly to draw a conclusion. Even though the first quarter this year may turn out to be soft, I am \"looking through\" the recent information to a full year of sustained higher\ngrowth. In that sense, my outlook remains optimistic for the full year. I expect real GDP growth to be between 2 1/2 and 3 percent.\nI remain hopeful for the full year because I think the fundamentals underpinning economic performance are notably improved compared to a year ago and earlier. Factors\nthat earlier impeded consumer spending and business investment have relented. Uncertainty about fiscal arrangements controlled by Congress is reduced. Business and\nconsumer confidence is higher. Risks of financial instability associated with problems in Europe have abated. The recent spell of emerging market turbulence has quieted,\nand U.S. equity markets seem to have firmed.\nWhile conditions have improved, substantial gaps exist between where we are and where we want or ought to be economically. Inflation is currently running around 1\npercent, depending on the measure used. The FOMC would like the ongoing rate of inflation to be closer to 2 percent. This is considered a healthier rate of inflation for the\nlonger term. At 2 percent, there is less risk of slipping into a cycle of economic contraction, and at the same time, price changes over time are not significant enough to distort\nthe planning of households and businesses.\nThere is also a sizeable employment gap between today's 6.6 percent rate of unemployment and estimates of full employment. We rely on a quantitative measure of\nunemployment to convey both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the country's work picture. The FOMC's most recent estimates of full employment, using the official\n\n\funemployment rate as a gauge, range from 5.2 percent to 5.8 percent. In my view, that difference of about 1 percent between today's rate and the Committee's estimate of\nfull employment may understate the distance still to be travelled.\nEven with these caveats, my bottom line is that the economy is in a better place today than a year ago and before. I maintain that the outlook is positive and, in terms of its\nbasics, much improved.\nPolicy stance today\nI'd like now to turn to an explanation of where the Fed's monetary policy stands. For all of last year, and since September 2012, the Fed pursued a program of large-scale\nasset purchases, or quantitative easing. Last December, the FOMC decided to reduce those purchases from $85 billion per month to $75 billion per month. In January, the\nCommittee brought those purchases down by another $10 billion per month. These decisions were based on the economic progress achieved since the recovery began in\nJune 2009, an improvement in employment conditions, and, importantly, the positive outlook for continued progress.\nAs long as the outlook remains solid and does not deviate dramatically from the path we believe it's on, I would expect the tapering of asset purchases to continue over the\nbalance of the year. I expect the asset purchase program to be completely wound down by the fourth quarter of this year.\nIn our public remarks over much of last year, my colleagues and I stressed a couple of very important messages. First, even with the phase-out of asset purchases, the basic\nstance of policy remains highly accommodative. To translate, the Committee intends to keep interest rates very low. The second message was that the QE program and the\nFed's policy interest-rate target are two separate tools of policy. Consequently, we can wind down the asset purchases—a program that was meant to provide temporary,\nsupplemental \"oomph\" to the low interest-rate policy—and preserve the accommodative positioning of policy appropriate for the reality of our economic situation.\nThe financial markets—particularly participants in the bond markets—seem to have heard these messages. In the aftermath of the tapering decision in early December,\nlonger-term interest rates did not rise and have not risen since then to any great extent. I think the transition currently underway has gone pretty well, and communication with\nthe public and markets on this aspect of policy was rather effective.\nGuidance as lead policy tool\nThat claim sets up my next topic—the role of forward guidance about interest-rate policy as an actual policy tool.\nAs most of you know, the FOMC sets a target for the federal funds rate. This is the rate at which banks with surplus reserves at the central bank lend to banks short of\nreserves on an overnight basis. This one interest rate—which the Fed can more or less control—serves as the foundation of the whole maturity spectrum of interest rates and\ninterest yields that matter to Main Street America. In that sense, the Fed's policy interest-rate decisions set the tone for broader financial conditions—tight or easy, as they\nsay. And, importantly, participants in longer-term bond markets anticipate the future path of the Fed's policy rate in determining the rates charged for car loans and home\nmortgages, for instance.\nThe federal funds rate target—the FOMC's policy rate—has been set at effectively zero for more than five years. It would not be possible to push it lower even if economic\nconditions called for lower rates. Quantitative easing was a way to exert further downward pressure on rates in the absence of the ability, in practical terms, to set the policy\nrate below zero. These have been unusual times since 2008, requiring unusual measures.\nNow that the program of asset purchases is being wound down—to repeat, appropriately, in my view—more of the work of maintaining an accommodative environment falls\nto Fed communication in general and forward rate guidance in particular.\nTo put emphasis on that point, let me quote from a speech last spring by Janet Yellen, the Fed's new chair. She said, \"[T]he Federal Reserve's ability to influence economic\nconditions today depends crucially on its ability to shape expectations of the future, specifically by helping the public understand how it intends to conduct policy over time,\nand what the likely implications of those actions will be for economic conditions.\"\nIndeed, modern monetary policy is aimed at influencing economic outcomes through the \"expectations channel.\" Expectations drive decisions by consumers, households,\nbusinesses, and investors throughout the economy. These decisions, taken together, have a big influence on the trajectory of the economy.\nSo what we at the Fed say we intend to do as regards interest-rate policy should have a big impact on what happens. I would argue that under the current circumstances,\nforward guidance about the direction of rate policy is more than just added commentary; it is a policy tool itself. And for the period ahead—the next couple of years at least—\nforward guidance may be the lead policy tool, arguably the most potent method we have for influencing financial conditions and economic results.\nLet me repeat that point using different words. Getting the economy we want depends increasingly on the ability of the public and participants in financial markets to hear,\nunderstand, and believe FOMC communication about the direction of monetary policy and the intended financial conditions tied to policy decisions.\nThe state of play of guidance\nToday, the central question that forward guidance addresses, and the predominant focus of financial market participants, is the timing of liftoff. Liftoff is code for the date of\nthe first increase of the policy interest rate.\nI'll lay out what the FOMC has said recently on this subject. A little over a year ago, in December 2012, the FOMC set an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent as a threshold for\nconsideration of liftoff. The unemployment rate has been falling rapidly toward that 6.5 percent threshold, and today stands at 6.6 percent. Its decline has been faster than\nmany expected, and the reasons have been more complicated than just unemployed people finding jobs.\nLabor economists follow the intensity of \"flows\" underlying employment statistics such as unemployment and labor force participation. At any given time, there are flows of\nemployed and unemployed people into and out of the labor force.\nYou may be aware that some of the decline in unemployment has coincided with falling labor force participation. About half of the fall in participation can be explained by\ndemographic trends— that is, baby boomers choosing to retire. At the same time, a nontrivial portion of the decline seems to be associated with a rising share of prime-age\nworkers who are not in the labor force. Some of these individuals are categorized as \"marginally attached\" to the workforce—they are available for work but have not actively\nlooked for a job in the last month. They represent what you might call a shadow workforce of people not actually counted among the unemployed. A subset of the marginally\n\n\fattached population is classified as \"discouraged workers.\" These people are not looking for a job because, for any number of reasons, they do not think there is work for\nthem out there.\nI should also mention the people who have a job—and so are officially employed—but are working part time and say they would like more hours.\nAll of these categories of underutilized labor resources—underutilized human capital, if you will—grew during the recession and have stayed elevated through the recovery.\nAs a result, I often point to what might be called qualitative weakness underlying the quantitative progress associated with the drop in unemployment to 6.6 percent.\nI would argue the official unemployment rate overstates progress to date. At the same time, the low readings of inflation are hard to square with stronger growth. I had these\nconcerns in mind when I supported the FOMC's decision to adjust its guidance in December of last year. The Committee said it anticipates that the policy rate will remain at\nzero well past the 6.5 percent threshold. Further, in its official statement following the January FOMC meeting, the Committee said that the \"highly accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends....\"\nThere are two reasons for this guidance. One is the weakness in employment data that underlies the improving unemployment rate. The other is the weakness of inflation\nreadings. I think that both factors should be equally important considerations in determining how long to keep the policy rate at its current level.\nMy current thinking on liftoff\nIn my Reserve Bank's most recent official forecast, we predicted liftoff of the policy rate in the second half of 2015. I remain comfortable with that forecast.\nEven with the intense interest in the date of liftoff, I expect that the work of forward guidance will not be finished just with the first increase of the fed funds rate. I expect\ncommunication and forward guidance to be especially demanding requirements for the FOMC, and for that matter other central banks, going forward.\nTo summarize my main points today, I see forward guidance on the Fed's policy rate as the lead monetary policy tool currently and for the foreseeable future. It is a challenge\nfor policymakers.\nThe central policy question is the timing of liftoff.\nThe key criteria for a liftoff decision are a firming of inflation to near the FOMC's target of 2 percent and both a quantitative and qualitative closing of the employment gap.\nSo, that's the \"lowdown\" on monetary policy as I see it at this juncture. I don't know how to use the rest of the song's title. It would just get me in trouble. I'll now try to answer\nyour questions.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\nRELATED LINKS ON OTHER SITES: Watch the video\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\n2014: A Transitional Year\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRotary Club of Birmingham\nFebruary 5, 2014\nKey points\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a February 5 speech at the Rotary Club of Birmingham, discusses the economic outlook for 2014 and Fed policy.\nLockhart says the last two quarters of economic expansion were rather strong, and this year is beginning with some carryover of momentum.\nHe expects 2014 to be a transitional year in terms of both economic performance and the mix of Fed policy tools. Absent a marked adverse change in the economic\noutlook, he expects the Fed's asset purchase program to be completely wound down by the fourth quarter of this year.\nLockhart notes that the FOMC expects to keep the federal funds rate at its current level until well past the 6.5 percent unemployment rate marker, especially if inflation\nremains low.\nLockhart believes that appropriate monetary policy and the self-reinforcing pull of inflation expectations should bring inflation back in line with the FOMC's longer-term\ntarget of 2 percent.\nLockhart states that monetary policy is positioned correctly and that policymakers should be patient and not quick to respond to zigs and zags in the data.\n\nGood afternoon and thank you to Philip Jackson, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, for that kind introduction. I'd like to\ntake a moment to recognize a few of our directors in attendance. I appreciate your dedication and service.\nI'm pleased to be with you today and happy to be back in Birmingham.\nMy overall message today will be optimistic. We are coming off two rather strong quarters of economic expansion. I think the year began with some\ncarryover of momentum, and even with the recent decline in equity markets, I sense in my conversations with business contacts across the\nSoutheast rather solid, well-grounded confidence about the year ahead.\nIn my remarks today I will offer an outlook for the year, but I will also give some time to a discussion of the tug and pull of mixed economic data.\nThere always seems to be some ambiguity around the true state of the economy. I hope you will find it interesting to hear about some of the\nquestions policymakers grapple with.\nI will close with comments on Fed policy. I'll share with you my mind-set on the appropriate positioning of monetary policy over the coming months. My colleagues in the\nFederal Reserve and on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may not have the same mind-set and underlying views. I am speaking, therefore, only for myself, not\nthe Federal Reserve or the FOMC.\nTransitional year\nFrom my perch at the Atlanta Fed, 2014 looks to be a transitional year. The Federal Reserve has a new leader. Janet Yellen was sworn in as the new Federal Reserve chair\non Monday and will preside over her first FOMC meeting as chair in March. If you follow the public communication and policy decisions of the FOMC, you've seen an\nemphasis under Ben Bernanke on transparency in communication and assertive action in support of the recovery. I expect continuity under Chair Yellen.\nThis year is also transitional in terms of the mix of Fed policy tools used to move the economy ahead. In December, the Committee made the decision to begin tapering asset\npurchases. The first reduction brought purchases down from $85 billion per month to $75 billion per month. At the last meeting a week ago, the Committee decided to bring\npurchases down by another $10 billion per month. Absent a marked adverse change in the outlook for the economy, I think it is reasonable to expect a progression of similar\nmoves, with the asset purchase program completely wound down by the fourth quarter of the year.\nAn orderly wind-down of asset purchases is contingent, as I suggested, on the economy staying substantially on track. It's hard to discern with absolute precision the track\nthe economy is on. Incoming data are rarely unambiguously positive or negative. Data are always messy. Policymakers are challenged to separate true signal from noise and\nto decide how much weight to put on the arrival of disappointing data reports.\nWe had such a situation with the arrival of the December payroll jobs number. It came in at a 74,000 net gain. A number closer to 190,000 was expected. My reaction—and\nthat of many of my colleagues—was to \"look through\" the December jobs report and assume the economy remains on the higher growth track enjoyed in the second half of\n2013.\nThere was a notable difference between performance in the first half and performance in the second half of 2013. In the first half of the year, real gross domestic product\ngrew at a rate of 1.8 percent annualized. This was a bit slower than the recovery average up to that point. In the second half of the year, growth picked up sharply, to an\nestimated annual pace of 3.7 percent.\nSome of the strength in the second half resulted from a buildup of inventory (which, of course, can't go on indefinitely), but we also saw strength in consumer spending,\nbusiness spending on equipment, and exports. The pickup in consumer activity and business investment hints at rising confidence about future prospects for the economy.\nWe may get some not-so-great numbers in the first quarter of this year. First-quarter GDP growth may be affected by weather events as well as the inventory cycle.\nEmployment numbers may also reflect these influences.\n\n\fStill, I think the fundamentals have improved, and the economy is likely to continue to perform in a higher gear over the full-year 2014. So, I will argue that 2014 may also turn\nout to be a transitional year in terms of economic performance.\nSustained higher growth ought to carry with it real progress on two key dimensions of economic performance—prices and employment. Both are explicitly set out as formal\nobjectives of the Fed as determined by Congress. The Fed's dual mandate calls for stable prices along with full employment.\nTo give you a fix on how we are starting the year relative to these goals, inflation is currently running around 1 percent per annum.\nGiven my current baseline outlook for the economy, I project inflation to gradually rise to around 2 percent, reaching that rate toward the end of 2015.\nTwo percent is the FOMC's longer-term target for inflation. This rate is low enough that it does not materially distort the economic decisions of households and businesses. At\nthe same time, it is just high enough to provide a safety margin against a debilitating cycle of deflation.\nJudging from a variety of indicators, it appears that expectations for future inflation are pretty well-anchored around 2 percent.\nUnfortunately, inflation is currently running well below this target. A persistent undershoot of inflation would likely be symptomatic of weakness in our labor and product\nmarkets, and reflective of risk to the economy going forward.\nI believe that a combination of appropriate monetary policy and the self-reinforcing pull of inflation expectations should bring inflation back in line with the FOMC's target,\nother things equal. That is my base-case forecast. But I am monitoring wage and price developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward 2 percent.\nAs regards employment, my forecast calls for continuing steady improvement in labor market conditions, consistent with my growth outlook. The unemployment rate is not\nthe sole indicator of labor market health, but it is an important benchmark. Unemployment—as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in its December monthly survey of\nhouseholds—is at 6.7 percent. We will get a new number on Friday.\nThe FOMC earlier set down a marker of 6.5 percent unemployment as a threshold for considering a change of interest-rate policy. We could cross that threshold before long.\nRecently, the Committee communicated that it expects to keep the federal funds rate at current levels well past 6.5 percent unemployment, especially if inflation is projected\nto stay below target. As I said earlier, absent a material change in the trajectory of the economy, the key policy question, as I see it, is how long to keep the federal funds rate\ntarget at zero.\nGaps/slack\nIn that regard, a question weighing on my mind as a policymaker is, how close or far are we from fulfillment of our mandated objectives—or, put differently, what is the extent\nof the current and near-term gaps we're dealing with?\nThe \"output gap\" is the distance between the economy's current performance and its potential. The \"employment gap\" is the distance between the current level of\nemployment—often expressed in terms of the rate of unemployment—and an estimate of full employment. And the \"inflation or price stability gap,\" if you will, is the difference\nbetween current readings of inflation and the FOMC's official inflation target, 2 percent. The inflation gap can be on either side of this target. Today, as I have mentioned, it is\nto the downside of 2 percent.\nI believe we're still dealing with sizeable gaps in terms of overall output, inflation, and employment. If inflation were running above 2 percent, my diagnosis might have to be\nmore nuanced, but today, the three gaps taken together suggest there remains a fair amount of slack in the economy. In the current context, the objectives are\ncomplementary.\nThe employment gap presents some analytical challenges. Much progress has been achieved in lowering the unemployment rate since the end of the recession. In fact, the\nunemployment rate has fallen faster than many forecasters expected.\nBut, as you have probably heard, this decline in unemployment has been accompanied by a sizeable drop in labor force participation—that is, the share of the working-age\npopulation in the labor market.\nSince the beginning of the recession at the end of 2007, the rate of labor force participation has declined by close to 3 percentage points—a very large and rapid decline by\nhistorical standards. In terms of today's population, that amounts to about 7 million people who are no longer part of the unemployment rate calculation. This development\nhas led some to wonder whether a falling unemployment rate may have lost some of its value as an indicator of improving labor market conditions.\nThis is where the analytical challenges come in. If the decline in labor force participation is due to structural changes—such as population aging—that is one thing. Monetary\npolicy cannot do much about the fact that we are getting older as a nation. But it is an entirely different matter if people are not participating in the labor market due to cyclical\nconditions. That would indicate the economy is not strong enough to create jobs and people are discouraged from looking for work. Monetary policy can do something to\ncombat weak spending conditions that could be holding back economic recovery.\nSo, which is it? Has the labor force participation rate fallen because of structural changes or cyclical conditions? It's not entirely clear, but the answer seems to be \"both.\" The\npoint is that even if we attribute much of the decline in labor force participation to structural developments, a significant part of the decline still seems to be a result of weak\nspending and the sluggish economic expansion.\nIn these circumstances, with indicators like the unemployment rate particularly difficult to read, readings of inflation can be especially informative. In general, we expect weak\ndemand to be associated with weak prices. Therefore, watching inflation and wage growth closely will help us gauge whether we're getting the basic economic strength\nneeded to improve the more complicated employment situation.\nAppropriate monetary policy\nIn closing, let me touch briefly on policy—the monetary policy of the FOMC. Notwithstanding the decision to taper asset purchases, the stance of policy remains very\naccommodative. Translation: short-term interest rates are quite low—and in my own outlook, they will remain low for quite some time. I expect the Fed's policy rate to stay put\nuntil well into 2015.\n\n\fThat assessment could be adjusted, of course, if economic conditions change a whole lot. But given my current views on the economy, I like the current positioning of policy.\nIt's in the right place for now, in my opinion. I think we policymakers should be patient—not too quick to respond to zigs and zags in the data.\nIn my view, the Committee should stay the course and let more clarity emerge on the sustainability of the recent pickup in growth, the path of inflation relative to the 2 percent\ntarget, and the nature of the employment situation.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThe Economic Outlook for 2014\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRotary Club of Atlanta\nJanuary 13, 2014\nKey points\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a January 13 speech at the Rotary Club of Atlanta, reviews current economic conditions, the economic outlook for the\nyear ahead, and the Fed's winding down of quantitative easing (QE).\nLockhart says we are entering this year on a more solid economic footing than we did last year. His view is that real GDP will expand between 2.5 and 3 percent in 2014.\nLockhart: Although the country has made a lot of economic progress, there's a fair distance yet to go before we should be satisfied. Both the employment picture and the\ninflation state of affairs have worrisome aspects. About 4 million more people than before the recession are unemployed today, and continued disinflation could pose risks\nto economic performance.\nLockhart believes that the overall accommodative posture of monetary policy is appropriate. The FOMC has stated that it intends to keep the short-term policy rate\nunchanged \"well past\" the achievement of a 6 1/2 percent unemployment rate.\nLockhart does not expect the change in leadership at the Federal Reserve to bring a change of basic policy direction. But if all goes as expected, there is a policy transition\nunderway from a QE world to a post-QE world.\nLockhart concludes that economy seems poised to transition to better conditions.\n\nHistory is likely to characterize the recovery from the Great Recession as slow and frustrating. The last four-and-a-half years have been frustrating,\nespecially to those of us who give predictions about the economic path ahead. In previous years, many of us have forecast accelerating growth only\nto be disappointed by developments in the year that followed.\nI was not the most optimistic among my colleagues, but the outlook I offered in some of my earlier speeches here at the Atlanta Rotary didn't\ncompletely pan out. In recent years, there has been a tendency in my business to predict that the next year will be better. The repeat of \"false\ndawns\" has taught me to be cautious.\nI did a little better a year ago. In preparation for today, I took a look at that speech and can claim that my forecast for 2013 mostly played out. I\npredicted gross domestic product (GDP) growth of between 2 and 2 1/2 percent for the year. This pace of growth would be in line with the slow\ngrowth trend since the recession ended and the recovery began in 2009. Although I did not explicitly lay it out in last year's speech, I expected\nrather weak growth in the first half of 2013 followed by stronger growth in the second half.\nThe most recent estimate of full-year growth for 2013 is 2.5 percent, according to the consensus of private forecasters—and indeed, growth accelerated in the second half.\nThe final number for third-quarter growth was 4.1 percent, and unofficial estimates for the fourth quarter, with the most recent export numbers, exceed 3 percent.\nCompared to previous Januaries, we are entering this year on a more solid economic footing. A year ago, I stressed the drag of uncertainties hanging over economic activity.\nFiscal policy uncertainty was most prominent. Although it wasn't always pretty, Congress got past the fiscal cliff and the fiscal drama of October. I think the weight of\nuncertainty holding back the economy has diminished.\nSo here we are again—here I am again—at an appropriate juncture to take stock of progress achieved, the state of the economy, and the challenges and risks in the year\nahead. And once again, I will offer an outlook for the coming year, this time with growing confidence. That's what I intend to talk about today. I hope to provide you some\ncontext for your own business decisions in 2014. I must emphasize I am speaking only for myself, not the Federal Reserve. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) and in the Federal Reserve System may not see things the same way.\nProgress\nBy most measures, the economy has made significant progress since the recession ended. Financial markets have stabilized, and the banking sector overall is in a much\nhealthier state.\nHousing has made a partial comeback. Housing starts are up significantly from recession lows. House prices are rising, and foreclosures are down.\nThe rebound in home values has helped households repair their balance sheets and given consumers more confidence. This trend, combined with the playing out of a long\ndeleveraging process, has put the household sector in a healthier state.\nThe corporate community—to generalize—is in solid financial shape, with debt down and lots of cash available for investment. Business conditions are improving broadly.\nManufacturing, for example, is making a comeback. Factory output, which had been growing slowly, accelerated late in 2013. Capacity utilization in manufacturing is now at\nits highest level since March 2008. Motor vehicle assemblies, which are an important and growing segment of our regional manufacturing base, have reached levels\napproaching the prerecession peak.\nManufacturing is benefiting from lower energy costs. Total U.S. oil and natural gas production stands at historic highs. We can thank technological advances for that. The\nstrength of the U.S. energy sector, coupled with rising international demand for American products, has generated export growth. The long-term prospects for domestic\nenergy supplies and cost reinforce my sense that the economy's fundamentals are improving.\n\n\fOutlook and risks\nNow let's look ahead. I expect the stronger pace of economic growth in the second half of 2013 to continue in 2014. My current view is that real GDP will expand between 2.5\nand 3 percent this year, and I would not be surprised if we achieve results at the upper end of this range.\nGiven this outlook for growth, it's reasonable to expect further progress on the employment front. The trend in jobs growth improved throughout most of 2013, notwithstanding\nthe surprisingly soft initial reading for December. The unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent in December, about a year sooner than forecasters were expecting when\nthe year began. Despite this improvement, about 4 million more people than before the recession are unemployed today. In a moment, I'll provide much more detail, but\nhere's the point regarding employment. While we've made substantial progress, we are far from a satisfactory situation. Hold that thought!\nTo round out my outlook for 2014, let me say a word on inflation. Rising inflation is not currently a problem. If anything, inflation is too low—well below the FOMC's longerterm objective of 2 percent. I see inflation rates moving gradually toward that objective as economic growth gains momentum. Again, I want to come back to the subject of\ninflation, so please also hold that thought—too low, not too high.\nForecasting is not a very certain exercise. It breeds humility. Things can go wrong. I mentioned at the beginning that disappointment followed earlier forecasts. Things have\ngone wrong in past years that slowed the recovery. To name two, there have been global financial problems, particularly coming from Europe. More recently, fiscal policy\nuncertainty and some amount of fiscal drag have disrupted the pace of improvement. A replay of these factors is not in my baseline outlook.\nIn fact, if I gauge the risks around the outlook I've laid out here, I conclude that the risks (the downside risks, to be more precise) have lessened. The restraining effects of\nfederal fiscal measures should diminish this year. That's one of the key reasons my growth outlook is more optimistic.\nEmployment\nSo now let me make my main point. While the country has made a lot of progress economically, and the economy appears to have some bounce in its step as we enter 2014,\nthere's a fair distance yet to go before we should be satisfied. Both the employment picture and the inflation state of affairs have worrisome aspects.\nLet's first take a deeper look at employment. As I mentioned earlier, the unemployment rate—the share of the labor force not working—has come down significantly since the\nrecession began. It doubled from 5 percent at the end of 2007 to almost 10 percent at the end of 2009, when employment trends began to improve. As of last Friday's report,\nthe unemployment rate now stands at 6.7 percent. Sixty-five percent of the increase in the unemployment rate caused by the recession has been reversed.\nI don't often resort to slides in my speeches, but I want to back up my central point as vividly as possible. One way to look at the nation's employment conditions is utilization\nof the country's labor resources. I'll use a familiar image (a football field) as a backdrop to make the argument that the unemployment rate is far from the whole story.\nProgress in the employment sphere has been uneven.\n\nUsing the prerecession peak as the goal line, in terms of the unemployment rate, we've gotten the ball 65 yards down the field.\nBut the unemployment rate is influenced by labor force participation, and there has been a sizable decline in the share of the population in the labor force since 2009. This\nexplains how you could get a big drop in the unemployment rate with anemic job gains, as occurred in December.\nSome of the decline in labor force participation since 2009 is due to the baby boomers retiring, but even among prime-age workers—those aged 25 to 54—the participation\nrate is down significantly. This suggests that other factors, such as low prospects of finding a job, are playing a role.\nTo examine this possibility, we can look at the sum of marginally attached workers. These are people who say they are willing to work and have looked for work recently but\nare not currently looking. During the recession, their numbers swelled. Using our football analogy, we've gained (or regained) only 12 yards of the ground lost (the increase in\nthe marginally attached) from 2007 to 2009. It's accurate to say the country has a large number of people in the so-called \"shadow labor force.\"\nSome economists have suggested that, because of the challenge of interpreting the decline in labor force participation, it might be more illuminating to look at the share of\nthe population that is working. When we look at the employment-to-population ratio for the prime-age group (aged 25 to 54), the picture is similarly discouraging. Since the\nend of 2009, employment gains for the core of the workforce have advanced down the field only 27 yards toward the prerecession peak.\nAlso, there is the issue of underemployment. Many Americans are working fewer hours than they would prefer because their employers are offering them only part-time work.\nThe share of workers who are involuntarily working part time doubled during the recession and has moved only about 30 percent lower since the employment recovery\n\n\fbegan. In football terms, we've advanced the ball only 31 yards on this measure of labor utilization.\nTo sum up, these comparisons of employment data suggest that the labor market is not as healthy as the improved unemployment rate might indicate. The unemployment\nrate drop may overstate progress achieved.\nIt's worth noting that wage and salary income growth remains weak. I hear very little from business contacts about upward wage pressures except in a few specialized job\ncategories. Wage pressures usually accompany growing demand and rising inflation but, although demand appears to be growing, inflation is very soft.\nInflation\nThe Federal Reserve has chosen an inflation target of 2 percent over the longer term.\n\nSuch a target is far enough away from the deflation danger zone and yet low enough to be ignored by businesses and households in their longer-term decision making.\nOver the past 12 months, inflation has averaged only 0.9 percent. Indeed, the broad patterns in the price data suggest we have been on a disinflationary trend for about two\nyears, as shown in this slide.\nContinued disinflation could pose risks to economic performance. This slide shows the trend of one key measure of inflation (the personal consumption expenditures inflation\nindex) over the last four years. At the Fed, we follow a number of inflation indices, and they show basically the same picture.\nThe inflation situation shown here seems disconnected from the recent growth momentum and the outlook that it will continue.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I think inflation will stabilize and begin to move back in the direction of the FOMC's 2 percent objective as the economy gathers momentum. So I'm\ninterpreting the soft inflation numbers as a risk signal. Through the lens of prices, the economy could be weaker than we currently believe.\nI talk with a lot of business people across the Southeast. Very few claim to have much pricing power. At the same time, inflation expectations—measured by surveys and\ninflation-adjusted financial instruments—have remained stable. There are no signs of disinflationary expectations being priced in. This gives me some confidence that\ninflation will firm.\nPolicy\nLet me conclude with a brief discussion of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The overall posture of policy is very accommodative, as we central bankers say, and\nappropriately so, in my opinion.\nIn earlier communications, the FOMC set a threshold of 6 1/2 percent unemployment as a condition for consideration of raising rates. In our most recent statement after the\nDecember meeting, the Committee communicated its intent to keep the short-term policy rate unchanged \"well past\" the achievement of a 6 1/2 percent unemployment rate. I\nthink this, too, is appropriate. As my football field representation showed, on what you might call a qualitative basis, we have a substantial employment gap. And, as of now,\nthe inflation data indicate disinflation, which is also worrisome.\nAs I'm sure you know, the FOMC decided at its December meeting to begin reducing the amount of monthly asset purchases by $10 billion a month—that is, from $85 billion\na month to $75 billion. This was the well-publicized \"tapering\" decision to phase out quantitative easing, or QE. This decision acknowledges progress made—especially in the\nemployment realm—and improving confidence in the outlook.\nIf the positive outlook I've outlined plays out, I would support similar tapering steps over the course of this year. Of course, the Committee will assess how things are going,\neconomically speaking, at each meeting, and decide on the next step.\nAt the end of one year and the beginning of another, it's tempting to attribute more and deeper historic significance to the turning of the calendar page than often turns out to\nbe real. That said, 2014 does look to me to be a year of transition.\nThere will be a transition of leadership of your central bank—that is certain. Janet Yellen will become chair on February 1. I do not expect the leadership change to bring a\nchange of basic policy direction, however.\n\n\fIf all goes as expected, there is a policy transition under way from a QE world, so to speak, to a post-QE world. As I said, that decision was made in December.\nAnd the economy itself seems poised to transition to better conditions. I hope I can return in a year and report I had it right.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

Lauderdale, Florida\nDecember 5, 2013\nKey points\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a December 5 speech at the Broward Workshop in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, reviews current economic conditions and\nthe Fed's eventual winding down of quantitative easing.\nLockhart says the economy has grown steadily, if slowly, since the recession ended four-and-a-half years ago, with annualized GDP growth averaging a little over 2\npercent, 7 million new jobs, and low inflation.\nLockhart's outlook for 2014 calls for some firming in economic activity, a gradual improvement in labor markets, and an inflation trend moving toward 2 percent.\nLockhart expects that a decision to begin tapering asset purchases will be considered in the coming meetings of the FOMC.\nLockhart feels that the financial markets have substantially internalized key points of the FOMC's direction with policy: the low-interest-rate environment will be maintained\nfor some time, a reduction of asset purchases is not tightening, and the Fed can change the mix of policy tools while preserving an environment of continuing economic\nprogress.\nLockhart says he would support a transition process of winding down asset purchases that would provide as much certainty as possible about how it will be done.\n\nGood morning and thank you for inviting me to speak to this prestigious group, the Broward Workshop. I'd like to take a moment to thank Tom Shea,\na former director of our Miami Branch, and Al Dosal, who currently serves as a director. I would also like to acknowledge Mike Jackson, one of your\nmembers, who has been serving as chair of our Miami board.\nOur directors serve principally as economic advisers and play a vital role in supplementing economic data with useful regional and sectoral\ninformation. Let me publicly thank them all for their service.\nToday I plan to provide my take on the current state of the economy and the outlook for 2014. I will also share my personal views on the current\nstance of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. More specifically, I'll comment on the alignment of market expectations with the conditional\nframework for tapering bond purchases that Chairman Bernanke laid out on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, in June.\nThe essence of the decision the Committee faces is whether to begin the process of winding down the use of an extraordinary monetary policy tool\nknown to the public as quantitative easing, or QE. The current program has been operating since September 2012 and is the third episode of the use of this tool. The\nfinancial markets are exceedingly interested in the prospect of reducing, over the coming months, bond purchases that are currently running at $85 billion per month. These\nasset purchases are made up of a roughly equal mix of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.\nThe expectation of a decision to start tapering has been a factor in the pricing of bonds across the maturity and issuer spectrum and, therefore, the market's determination of\nlong-term interest rates. The prospects for sectors like housing and autos are highly influenced by interest rates. It's fair to say that the near-term actions of the Fed are a\nfront-and-center concern of the financial community, business community, and the general public.\nAs a preface to my remarks today, it's important that I emphasize I'm speaking for myself, not for the Federal Reserve, and my views are not necessarily shared by my\ncolleagues on the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nReview of progress and economic outlook\nLet me start by attempting to define the context of upcoming policy deliberations. In the four and a half years since the recession ended, the country's economic conditions\nhave improved a lot, yet are short of what you'd call victory.\nThe economy has grown steadily, if slowly. Annualized GDP growth has averaged a little over 2 percent over this period. The level of real economic activity is about 5 percent\nhigher than the pre-recession peak. And with that expansion, the economy has netted more than 7 million new jobs. Inflation has been low—averaging 1.7 percent measured\non an annual basis over the postrecession period.\nA number of industries or industry sectors that contribute significantly to the overall economy have recovered a lot of ground. Improvement in the housing sector, for example,\nhas been a positive factor, especially in the more recent stage of the recovery. Housing starts have almost doubled from their low point in 2009. The Case-Shiller house price\nindex for the third quarter was up 11 percent from a year earlier and reached the highest level for the index since the third quarter of 2008. Other housing data tell a similar\nstory of recovery. Existing home sales were up 13 percent last quarter from a year earlier and were at their highest level since early 2007. One of the concerns earlier this fall\nwas the potential effect of higher long-term rates on the housing sector. Momentum in the housing sector has softened somewhat, but hasn't deteriorated markedly.\nStill, as I said, the recovery has been slow, and the acceleration of growth that many economists—including Fed economists—predicted has not really materialized.\nPositive developments that suggest the glass is half full are offset by areas of persistent weakness that bias some observers to the view that the economic glass is half\nempty.\n\n\fTo cite a couple of half-full/half-empty phenomena, unemployment has dropped from 10 percent to 7.3 percent today, but participation in the workforce has also fallen. And\ninflation, as I said, has remained low on average, but is actually too low to totally dismiss the concern that the economy is weaker than measured and vulnerable to a\nreversal.\nWe track a lot of data at the Atlanta Fed to consolidate a view of the trajectory of the economy. Recent evidence of forward momentum coming from the data has been mixed.\nAs a further example of mixed signals, let me relate a report on October construction spending received Monday of this week:\nTotal construction spending...rose in October, well above the consensus expectation.\nPrivate residential construction spending declined in October following an increase in September. Private nonresidential construction fell...following a decline in\nSeptember. And public construction spending rose in October.\nYou can't help but think \"on the one hand\" and then \"on the other hand.\"\nAt a higher level, looking at the overall growth picture, the economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, according to current estimates, which\nwill be revised later this morning. That sounds like a pretty good number, but about one-third of that growth was greater inventory accumulation. The pace of spending (what\neconomists call \"final sales,\" which eliminates inventory swings) rose just a shade above 2 percent last quarter, virtually right on its trend for the last three-and-a-half years.\nChanges in inventory investment are often followed by their opposite—in this case, the working off of inventories. As a consequence, growth this quarter is very likely to be\nonly half that seen in the third quarter as those inventories are drawn down. Recent tracking estimates of fourth-quarter GDP growth are substantially below 2 percent.\nIn an economy as large, complex, and diversified as ours, the data are almost always going to be somewhat noisy. That said, it's my judgment that the recent incoming data\nare, on net, positive.\nTapering decision considerations\nI expect that a decision to begin tapering asset purchases will be considered in the coming meetings of the FOMC. In my assessment, the trajectory of recovery—the outlook\nfor the economy—justifies consideration of such a move.\nMy outlook for 2014 calls for some firming in economic activity. Along with that expectation for stronger output growth, I am expecting labor markets to continue their gradual\nimprovement and inflation to move in the direction of the FOMC's 2 percent target.\nMy Atlanta Fed colleagues and I will be monitoring the incoming data and taking stock of information gathered from business contacts—our directors being prominent among\nthem. In this process, I'll be looking for positive evidence of momentum as well as the absence or retreat of factors that could restrain or even torpedo progress.\nLet me lay out my current thought process for coming to a decision to support or not support, as the case may be, tapering asset purchases.\nI'm looking for continuing positive evidence that employment is growing at a sufficient pace to sustain a steady, if gradual, march toward the Fed's objective of full\nemployment. Job growth came in at 204,000 in October. Over the last 12 months (October to October), monthly jobs gains have averaged 194,000. The rate of\nunemployment has fallen to 7.3 percent from 7.9 percent a year ago.\nI'm also looking for evidence of important elements of growth—important components of GDP—acting as drivers. One such driver is the growth of consumer spending. I think\nthere are reasons to be optimistic that consumer spending will strengthen. Real personal income growth has been firming. Household balance sheets are improving—in part\nbecause of rising home values and the rise of the stock market. Credit delinquencies are now below their pre-crisis lows.\nIn the category of what I'm hoping will be absent or shrink, I'm expecting a fall-off of fiscal drag in the coming year. Cuts in government spending have taken more than half a\npercentage point off GDP growth over the past year. The net drag of a downsizing government sector is projected to lessen, but not entirely dissipate, in 2014.\nI am also watching for any signs of disinflation. So, to turn that around, I'm looking for the absence of consistent disinflationary price trends. Inflation has, by a variety of\nmeasures, averaged about 1 percent over the past year, well under the FOMC's longer-term objective of 2 percent. Some of that shortfall has come from falling energy\nprices. But even if we look through the behavior of energy prices, inflation readings have been exceptionally soft. While I don't yet see convincing evidence that a\ndisinflationary trend is under way, inflation trends bear careful watching.\nFinally, my thought process includes a scan of the horizon for potential sources of economic shocks of the kind that could precipitate a reversal, shocks that could throw the\neconomy completely off track. There are always risks, but over the past year, I believe many of the most worrisome sources of risk have retreated.\nThe risk of severe financial instability coming from Europe has been managed down.\nWe've gotten past the fiscal cliff, and in October, the serious consequences associated with a fiscal default were avoided. The same fiscal matters come to a head again in\nJanuary, of course, so we can't yet breathe easy. There is still significant risk—that has to be acknowledged.\nSome recessions in the past have been precipitated by sustained oil price spikes. The Middle East remains fairly unsettled, and there are a number of factors at play, but I\nthink the risk of an oil or energy price shock affecting the United States is relatively low.\nAs I think through the various factors to take into account—the data evidence, the outlook, the balance of risks—I am pretty confident in the sustainability of the economy's\nprogress. The recent flow of data is not pushing me off the outlook I espoused a few moments ago. Again, I am forecasting a firming in economic activity, a gradual\nimprovement in labor markets, and an inflation trend moving in the direction of 2 percent.\nI didn't have such confidence in the fall of 2012, when the current program of asset purchases began. At that time, employment growth was slowing, and we were seeing\ncontinued weakness in housing, household deleveraging, and a much higher degree of uncertainty about the fiscal and banking situation in Europe.\n\n\fI also was not comfortable in September of this year with what appeared to be lagging job gains (they were later revised higher) and the fiscal negotiations coming in\nOctober.\nAnd I agreed with the decision at the October FOMC meeting to wait a while longer given the uncertain effect of the fiscal drama on consumer and business confidence and\nthe complications the shutdown caused in tracking the economy through vital data.\nI now think it is appropriate in coming meetings to put a tapering decision on the table as long as the resulting overall posture of policy preserves a high degree of\naccommodation.\nKey points in Committee communications\nEven though communication of the Committee's direction with policy has been complicated and challenging over the last months, I think many in the financial markets have\nsubstantially internalized certain key points. They are:\nThe low-interest-rate environment will be maintained for quite some time.\nA reduction of asset purchases is not intended to be tightening.\nAnd, the Fed can change the mix of tools we use to implement policy while preserving an environment supportive of continuing economic progress.\nIf market expectations are that the asset purchase program will wind down over the coming year, I think that is reasonable.\nIf and when the FOMC arrives at a decision to wind down asset purchases, it's my view that it will be helpful to the transition process to provide as much certainty as possible\nabout how this will be done. The minutes of the October FOMC meeting noted that\n[S]ome participants mentioned that it might be preferable to...announce a total size of remaining purchases or a timetable for winding down the program. A\ncalendar-based step-down...would be easier to communicate and might help the public separate the Committee's purchase program from its policy for the\nfederal funds rate and the overall stance of policy.\nI am among those who see merit in this approach as long as the economy follows roughly the path we expect. Once the decision is made, I favor providing the public as\nmuch clarity and certainty as possible about how the change will be executed.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook\nDennis Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAnnual Business and Economic Summit\nMontgomery, Alabama\nNovember 12, 2013\nKey points\nAtlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a November 12 speech at the Annual Business and Economic Summit in Montgomery, Alabama, reviews current\neconomic conditions and the Fed's highly accommodative monetary policy actions to support economic recovery.\nLockhart says that in an effort to orient the public's expectations regarding policy actions, the Fed employs several communication methods, including a formal statement\nafter each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, press conferences, and meeting minutes.\nLockhart says the Fed is pursuing two objectives—full employment and low and stable inflation.\nThe economy is growing at a slow pace, Lockhart says. Substantial progress has been made on employment, but there is more to be done. At the same time, inflation is\ntoo low, which carries some risk of a weakening economy.\nLockhart's baseline outlook for next year is for stronger economic activity—a growth rate in the range of 2 1/2 to 3 percent. But he is concerned about the possibility that\nthe economy will stay on its current track and we'll see no acceleration.\nLockhart stresses that the right monetary policy for these circumstances is continued strong stimulus, but that is not to say that the mix of policy tools needs to or will stay\nthe same.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction.\nOne of the ways the Federal Reserve's monetary policy shapes economic outcomes is through its influence on the expectations of the public about\nthe policy environment. The Fed and particularly the financial markets are engaged in a continuous minuet of policy action and communication and\nasset pricing. The market's pricing of various interest-paying instruments—from overnight repurchase agreements to long-term bonds—sets the\nrate or yield curve. The price of credit affects decisions of consumers and businesses here in Montgomery and across the country on matters such\nas buying or refinancing a home, buying a car, and making a capital investment.\nIn an effort to orient the public's expectations, the Federal Reserve—specifically, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC—employs a\nnumber of communications methods. A formal statement follows each FOMC meeting. Three weeks later, minutes of the meeting are published.\nThe Chairman conducts a press conference after some FOMC meetings. The Chairman testifies at least semiannually before Congress. The FOMC\npublishes quarterly compilations of the economic forecasts of individual FOMC participants—Fed governors and Reserve Bank presidents. And Fed\nofficials make speeches and do interviews. Many of these communications are reported and interpreted in the media.\nThe content of our public communication includes assessments of economic conditions, the outlook for the economy, risks to the outlook, and, importantly, the framework for\nmaking a future policy decision. Since policy must respond to evolving conditions and developments, the public and the markets are understandably interested in what is\noften called the \"reaction function\" of the Committee.\nThe Committee's reaction function is a matter of great interest at the moment because of anticipation of a decision about tapering. Tapering as commonly understood refers\nto the winding down of the Fed's program of asset purchases, or QE. Clarity regarding how a consensus-driven policymaking committee will react to a range of possible\neconomic scenarios is a real test. It's especially challenging when the degree of economic uncertainty seems to be high.\nThe policymaking context today is murkier than I would like. Because of the federal government shutdown, some of the data we follow are likely to be less reliable than usual\nthrough December at least. Earlier in the year, uncertainty seemed to be dissipating. But in my recent soundings of business contacts across the Southeast, I hear\nsentiments that uncertainty is back and visibility is shortening.\nToday I'll do my best to be as clear as I can. I must emphasize that the views you'll hear are mine alone. They may not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC and in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nFor the sake of clarity, I'm going to lay out my arguments right up front. Here are my key arguments: the Fed is pursuing two objectives—full employment and low and stable\ninflation. Currently, the economy is growing slowly. A lot of progress has been made since the end of the recession on employment, but there is a way to go before we should\nbe satisfied. Inflation is too low. It is well below the FOMC's goal of 2 percent.\nMy baseline outlook calls for an improved economy in 2014—growing a bit faster than it has been. But that may not happen. There is a nontrivial chance that 2014 will look\nlike 2013. Next year's economic outcomes will swing importantly on fiscal drag and consumer spending. Even with better growth, in all likelihood, at year-end 2014, inflation\nwill still be too low and employment levels will be well short of the goal. Therefore, monetary policy overall should remain very accommodative for quite some time. The mix of\ntools we use to provide ongoing monetary stimulus may change, but any changes will not represent a fundamental shift of policy.\nAt the FOMC meeting two weeks ago, the Committee chose to hold to an accommodative monetary stance to support ongoing recovery. As most of you are aware, the\nFOMC is using two principal tools to provide this policy accommodation. The first is a near-zero level of the federal funds rate target along with communication of how long\n\n\fand under what conditions we will maintain that level. The second is bond purchases, so-called QE3. The Fed is buying $85 billion per month of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities and government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. In late October, the Committee decided to keep both of those policy tools in force.\nCurrent state of the economy\nAs context for that decision, let me elaborate on the condition of the economy. As I said, the economy is growing slowly—averaging around 2 percent. At the same time,\nconsumer inflation is low. Consumer activity is expanding modestly. The consumer remains cautious. Manufacturing activity is continuing to gain strength, but not by leaps\nand bounds. Business investment is restrained. To generalize, businesses are not placing big bets on the future—they seem to be expecting more of the same in terms of\ndemand.\nEmployment is growing at a pretty steady, if unspectacular, pace. Monthly job gains over the last six months have averaged 174,000. It's fair to say employment conditions\nare improving. The official rate of unemployment calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was 7.3 percent in October, down from 7.9 percent a year ago. Over the last\nyear, the economy has created 2.3 million payroll jobs on net.\nThis is a good story, and an important story. When the current asset purchase program was announced in September 2012, private forecasters expected that the\nunemployment rate at the end of this year would be about 1/2 percentage point higher than it is today. In that sense, there has been substantial improvement in labor markets\nover the past year.\nOn the other hand, several measures of labor market health are less satisfactory. Long-term unemployment is at historically high levels. And the number of people working\npart time while looking for full-time work remains elevated. There are about 4 million more people unemployed today than before the recession. And there are significant\nnumbers of discouraged workers who are not counted in the labor force who would return if conditions were more encouraging.\nEven though the economy is growing, and we're making progress on unemployment, there are real concerns about whether the recent modest pace of GDP growth is\nenough to maintain employment momentum.\nInflation trend\nFinally, I'll comment on inflation. People generally tend to worry about the upside risk of inflation. But as I said at the outset, inflation is too low. A persistent low rate of\ninflation raises concerns about a stalling out of economic expansion.\nIn January 2012, the FOMC established an official inflation target of 2 percent as measured by the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index. By that measure,\nthe trailing 12-month rate of inflation was 0.9 percent in September. The recent three-month trend is only marginally stronger at 1.2 percent.\nMy interpretation is that inflation has been reasonably stable, but at a low level—well below the desired level of 2 percent. It's not falling, but it's also not showing much\ntendency to move toward our targeted goal.\nI don't think the inflation situation is that alarming yet. There are few signs of disinflation (the slowing of the rise of prices), let alone outright deflation (that is, broadly based\nfalling prices). And inflation expectations of the public remain stable. But I would like to see the inflation rate rise to around 2 percent and stay there.\nThe outlook\nNow let's look ahead to 2014. I'm assuming stronger economic activity next year—a growth rate in the range of 2 1/2 to 3 percent. Even with the preliminary third-quarter\nGDP estimate of 2.8 percent, full-year 2013 is likely to come in closer to 2 percent. To achieve a faster pace of growth, it's my opinion that we'll need to see two\ndevelopments. First, we'll need a pickup in consumer activity and, second, we'll need a fall-off of intensity of fiscal drag.\nThe fiscal drag weighing on the economy has a number of elements. They include the ongoing effects of the tax increases at the beginning of this year, the effects of the\nsequester, any lingering effects of the recent government shutdown, and the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty on business investment and consumer spending.\nAs regards the shutdown, we at the Atlanta Fed expect the direct impact of the shutdown to be relatively small and temporary. We expect to lose half a percent of GDP\ngrowth in the fourth quarter, with a similar amount added back, in all probability, in the first quarter of 2014.\nMy greater concern relates to fiscal policy uncertainty because it can affect consumer and business confidence. I've recently heard opinions among contacts in the region to\nthe effect that consumer confidence took a hit with the debt ceiling drama and the shutdown. In fact, consumer confidence did fall sharply between August and October this\nyear. Whether these effects are long-lasting remains to be seen.\nTo sum up, I remain cautiously optimistic that growth will pick up next year. This is my baseline outlook. But, at this juncture, I can't fully discount the possibility that the\nexpected economic improvement won't materialize and that we'll see a replay of the weak growth of the past three years. This possibility is an influence on my thinking about\nthe appropriate direction of monetary policy, the topic I'll turn to now.\nStance of policy\nMonetary policy is highly accommodative—as central bankers say. The FOMC is currently using two tools to maintain the desired degree of monetary accommodation—the\npolicy interest rate and bond purchases. Importantly, the FOMC has stated that it intends to keep the short-term policy rate low at least until the unemployment rate falls\nbelow 6 1/2 percent. This \"forward guidance\" is meant to convey a sense of how long short-term interest rates will stay near current levels.\nThere is some confusion about how the Fed's forward guidance and asset purchase program relate to each other. I will give you my view.\nIn the toolkit the FOMC has at its disposal, there is a sense in which asset purchases and low policy rates are complementary. Asset purchases and forward guidance on\ninterest rates are complements in the sense that they are both designed to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. Asset purchases obviously exert downward\npressure through the act of buying in specific maturity sectors of the Treasury and mortgage-backed securities market. Forward guidance on the short-term policy rate (the\nfed funds rate) influences market beliefs about the path of policy, and that too influences longer rates. Lower long-term rates encourage spending on business investment\nand consumer activity in interest-rate-sensitive sectors like autos and housing.\n\n\fBut there is also a sense in which these tools are substitutes. By substitutes I mean that guidance pointing to a sustained low policy rate and asset purchases are discrete\ntools that can be deployed independently or in varying combinations. They can be thought of as a particular policy tool mix chosen to fit the circumstances at this particular\nphase of the recovery. In my view, the use of these two tools has been effective in combination over the last many months. Both have provided stimulus. I think of asset\npurchases as supplemental stimulus on top of low short-term interest rates—current and prospective.\nGoing forward, it may be appropriate to adjust the policy tool mix. That will depend on circumstances and the economic diagnosis of the moment.\nI want to close where I began and repeat the basic points of my remarks today. The economy is growing at a slow pace. Even with that slow growth, substantial progress has\nbeen made on the employment front, but there is more to be done. At the same time, inflation is too low, and that carries some risk of a weakening economy.\nI expect things to pick up in 2014, but it's possible the economy will stay on its current track and we'll see no acceleration. The right monetary policy for these circumstances\nis continued strong stimulus. That is not to say, however, that the mix of policy tools needs to or will stay the same.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: PDF version • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nEconomic Recovery, Small Business, and the Challenge of Commercial Real Estate\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nUrban Land Institute\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate Conference\nAtlanta, Ga.\nNov. 10, 2009\nI appreciate the opportunity to speak to and with this sophisticated real estate audience about the interaction between conditions in the commercial\nreal estate (CRE) sector and the prospects for economic recovery. In earlier speeches, I have drawn attention to the exposure of the country's\nbanking and financial system to troubled commercial real estate loans as a significant emerging risk.\nBut in those speeches I didn't go much beyond identification of the risk, suggesting it bears watching.\nThis morning I'd like to go a bit further and venture an assessment of the CRE problem's likely impact on economic recovery. I will try to give you a\nsense—as a policymaker concerned with the broad economy—of how I am sizing up the commercial real estate challenge. One of my themes this\nmorning will be the links, or connectivity, between sectors and the potential for troublesome, self-reinforcing interactions.\nI must emphasize that the views I'll express are my personal thoughts and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve and\non the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic situation\nI believe an economic recovery is under way. It probably started in the summer.\nThe third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth number was 3.5 percent, the first increase in real GDP since mid-2008 and the largest gain since 2007. The primary\ncontributor to this gain was real consumer spending, which rose at a 3.4 percent rate, largely because of the \"cash for clunkers\" program. In addition, federal outlays grew\nrapidly, and the pace of inventory liquidation slowed. Accompanying positive GDP news, inflation measures remained relatively subdued.\nThere are other signs of improving conditions. Home prices appear to have bottomed out and have begun to move up in some markets. House sales appear to be growing in\nmany markets.\nSome financial markets—but not all—have stabilized, and risk spreads have normalized. For example, in the very important short-term interbank lending market, one-month\nand three-month LIBOR rates are very close to precrisis levels as measured by the spread over the federal funds rate.\nThe situation is much improved, but there are sobering aspects of the economic picture. Let me cite two.\nFirst, the economy has been supported and stimulated by several government programs. Appropriately, these programs are temporary. However, they are at various stages\nof removal or extension. It might be useful to go over the status of the key programs.\nThe $787 billion fiscal stimulus program remains in force. Nearly $200 billion of this amount has been paid out through the end of October.\nThe \"cash for clunkers\" program, part of the stimulus effort, has already expired.\nThe first-time home buyers' tax credit has been broadened and extended for another nine months.\nUnemployment insurance has been extended.\nThe Fed's credit market support liquidity facilities are winding down on their own.\nThe Fed's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) to support asset-backed securities markets is expected to expire in March 2010 with the exception of newly\nissued commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which is scheduled to expire in June.\nThe Fed's large-scale asset purchase program of Treasury securities ended Oct. 30. The agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency note purchases are\nscheduled to conclude at the end of the first quarter next year.\nThe Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), used to inject capital into banks, is seeing some return of capital to the government.\nThe FDIC's temporary liquidity guarantee program has expired.\nThese are by no means all of the government efforts to stabilize the economy and financial markets, stimulate activity, and treat the effects of job loss. Certainly, the Fed's\nmaintenance of its policy rate at the so-called zero lower bound for almost a year now should not be overlooked.\nA second reason to strike a note of caution about the economic picture is that both the data and anecdotal descriptions of ground-level reality are quite mixed. Data on\nforeclosures, unemployment, personal income, and bank failures continue to disappoint. Also, nonresidential construction continues to decline, and state and local\ngovernment budgets remain severely constrained.\nAlong with my colleagues at the Atlanta Fed, I spend a lot of my time asking business contacts about industry conditions and the outlook for their businesses. In recent\nsoundings we've heard frequently about weak top-line sales, continuing inventory liquidation, reticence regarding capital expenditures, and reluctance to hire.\nCharacteristics of this recession\nTurning to the outlook from here, my baseline forecast is for a relatively subdued pace of growth beyond the current quarter and through the medium term. The potential\n\n\fsluggishness of the recovery partly reflects certain unique characteristics of this recession. It was led by a crisis in banking and capital markets that was triggered by a sharp\nand persistent reduction in valuations of residential real estate assets.\nThe downturn in residential real estate did not remain contained in that sector. Trouble was transmitted to the rest of the economy via credit markets. The housing downturn\ntriggered a crisis on Wall Street that soon became a recession on Main Street, and, as job losses mounted and delinquencies rose, fed back again to financial markets. Also,\npersonal consumption retrenched because of the real estate price shock, tighter credit, and fear of job loss hitting close to home.\nDespite marked improvements in financial markets from a year ago and improved flow of private capital to banks in recent months, the banking system has not fully\nrecovered—far from it. Bank credit losses are still climbing, and many banks are still capital constrained. It almost goes without saying that recovery of the banking system is\ncrucial to the recovery of the overall economy.\nTo draw insights from the recession relevant to the future, it's instructive to consider the connectivity among sectors and the potential of a self-reinforcing negative feedback\nloop involving multiple sectors.\nToday, I'm particularly concerned about the interaction among bank lending, small business employment, and CRE values.\nTo elaborate, there is a tight linkage between CRE values and jobs. In a mid-September conference at the Atlanta Fed, CRE practitioners, investors, and academics agreed\nthat the evolution of the CRE picture will depend greatly on the path of employment. This point was strongly reinforced in the Urban Land Institute's \"Emerging Trends in Real\nEstate\" report at this conference.\nSmall business impact\nLet me go on to show the link between jobs and small business credit. During the last two economic expansions, small firms (those with fewer than 50 employees)\ncontributed about one-third of net job growth. But the depth and duration of this recession have taken a substantial toll on small businesses. In the 2001 recession, small\nfirms held up reasonably well and accounted for only 9 percent of net job loss. In this recession, however, small firms have accounted for about 45 percent of net job losses\nper our most recent data through the end of 2008.\nSmall businesses tend to depend greatly on the banking sector—especially community and regional banks—for financing. A Federal Reserve survey earlier in the decade\nshowed that more than half of smaller firms had a credit line or loan with a bank. In addition, about half of these businesses used a personal or business credit card to\nfinance working capital. In this recession, credit standards have tightened for all businesses, including small businesses.\nAt this juncture, it's hard to be encouraged about a fast rebound in job growth. As you know, last week's employment report pushed the official unemployment rate to 10.2\npercent, the highest since May 1983. Â,â Net job losses continue on a monthly basis but at a declining pace. Because employment growth tends to lag recovery from a\nrecession and because of factors such as small business credit constraints, my current outlook for employment is one of very slow net job gains once the trend reverses, in\nall likelihood sometime next year. If this view is correct, this job growth outlook doesn't help the commercial real estate situation.\nSo how serious is the CRE problem for the financial system and the broad economy?\nFirst, let me provide some overview comments: While the CRE problem is serious for parts of the banking industry, I don't believe it poses a broad risk to the financial\nsystem. Compared with residential real estate, the size of the CRE debt market is smaller, and the exposure is more concentrated in smaller banks.\nHowever, I am concerned about the potential impact of CRE on the broader economy. Unlike residential real estate, there is not the same direct linkage from CRE to\nhousehold wealth—and therefore consumption—caused by erosion of home equity. However, there could be an impact resulting from small banks' impaired ability to support\nthe small business sector—a sector I expect will be critically important to job creation.\nTo add some detail: At the end of June 2009 there was approximately $3.5 trillion of outstanding debt associated with CRE. This figure compares with about $11 trillion of\nresidential debt outstanding.\nAbout 40 percent of the CRE debt is held on commercial bank balance sheets in the form of whole loans. A lot of the CRE exposure is concentrated at smaller institutions\n(banks with total assets under $10 billion). These smaller banks account for only 20 percent of total commercial banking assets in the United States but carry almost half of\ntotal CRE loans (based on Bank Call Report data).\nMany small businesses rely on these smaller banks for credit. Small banks account for almost half of all small business loans (loans under $1 million). Moreover, small firms'\nreliance on banks with heavy CRE exposure is substantial. Banks with the highest CRE exposure (CRE loan books that are more than three times their tier 1 capital) account\nfor almost 40 percent of all small business loans.\nTo repeat my current assessment, while the CRE problem is very worrisome for parts of the banking industry, I don't see it posing a broad risk to the financial system.\nNonetheless, CRE could be a factor that suppresses the pace of recovery. As the recovery develops, the CRE problem will be a headwind, but not a show stopper, in my\nview.\nIt's appropriate to be a bit tentative in the assessment of CRE risk to the financial system, however. In 2007, many underestimated the scale and contagion potential of the\nsubprime residential mortgage-backed securities problem. With this experience in mind, my assessment should continue to be refined.\nThat said, I do see the process of CRE adjustment and resolution as a pivotal element of economic rebuilding. Toward these ends, on Oct. 30, financial regulators issued\nguidance addressed to both bank examiners and financial institutions. The guidance called for a balanced and pragmatic approach to CRE loan workouts and examiner loan\nclassifications, consistent with accurate and timely recognition of losses.\nIn my view, now that growth has resumed, the overall objective of economic policy should be to bring about a durable recovery and an environment that reduces\nunemployment as quickly as possible while containing inflationary pressures. The process of achieving this objective will necessarily involve judicious removal of government\nsupports and the normalization of monetary policy. As policymakers consider these decisions, attention to the state and trends in the commercial real estate sector will be\nessential.\n\n\fContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed Speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nEarly Childhood Education, Economic Development, and the Business Community\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nUniversity of Miami\nCoral Gables, Fla.\nOctober 22, 2009\nI'm delighted to be here at the University of Miami as part of your program, \"Investing in Florida's Future.\" For the purposes of addressing you today,\nlet me explain that I'm wearing two hats. One hat is the Federal Reserve hat. The other is cochair of a commission on early childhood education for\na 13-county area that encompasses metropolitan Atlanta. It turns out that a linkage can be made between my responsibility as an economic\npolicymaker and my role leading the commission. I'll touch on that in a moment. The commission is a creature of the United Way of Metropolitan\nAtlanta. The purpose of the commission is to assess the pre-K education landscape in the Atlanta area and recommend a way forward.\nThe commission began its proceedings about a year ago and is now getting to the point of finalizing findings and recommendations. The\ncommission will make recommendations to a number of stakeholders in the Atlanta community who have equity in the cause of early childhood\neducation. Among those stakeholders, we have presumed, is the business community.\nIn my remarks today I will discuss the connection between the interests and capabilities of a metro area business community and investment in preK early childhood education as a foundational element of economic development.\nDefining pre-K early childhood education\nLet me make clear what I'm talking about. Before I began the work of our commission I knew little about the specifics of pre-K education. So it would not surprise me if some\nof you aren't sure what this subject is all about.\nI'm talking about broadly accessible center-based, professionally delivered, appropriately curriculum-centered education for young children starting as early as two and a half\nyears old. That starting point is, today, mostly an aspiration. A more feasible focus would be on three- and four-year-olds. I am also talking about engagement of parents\nthrough the whole period from before birth to five years old, the age at which most children enter the formal kindergarten-to-grade 12 school system. Over this time span,\nadvocates place special emphasis on the period from birth through two years old, when parents are the dominant influence on child development.\nLet me also be clear what I am not talking about. Early childhood education, in my thinking, should not be confused with simple, low-quality day care. Of course, some\nelement of day care comes with any structured effort for children of this age. But the most developed early education programs aim to develop the child's cognitive, social,\nemotional, and motor skill readiness for the start of formal schooling in kindergarten.\nDiscipline applied to the work of the Atlanta commission\nWhat I have just described evokes a variety of legitimate questions and reactions in some quarters. These range from skepticism that social investment in this sort of initiative\nwill make much difference over time to indignation at the suggestion that many young children cannot achieve kindergarten readiness in the home.\nIn conducting the work of the Atlanta commission, we have been mindful of the full spectrum of natural doubts and reactions and have tried to adhere to some guiding\nprinciples—or disciplines.\nWe agreed to ground the case for further action and investment in empirical evidence.\nWe committed to making very concrete recommendations addressed to specific stakeholders.\nWe agreed to shape recommendations that will meet the test of practical feasibility, particularly where scarce funding resources are concerned. And in that regard, we have\ntried to apply the standard of measurable return on investment.\nCoverage of the commission\nWe began our commission's work with what we called our education phase. Over eight meetings, we were exposed to the neurology of young child development, the\nresearch on the economic development impact of early learning intervention, the current norms of quality in early education, and the practical experience of other cities and\nstates in this field.\nAmong the more powerful presentations was that of Miami's David Lawrence. I'm sure most of you are aware of Dave's work here in Dade County and Florida. Dave\nemphasized that community leaders who are trying to advance the cause of early education must think of their efforts as a political and social movement. We're incorporating\nthat notion into our commission's recommendations for Atlanta.\nAs I said earlier, the Atlanta commission is in the process of finalizing findings and recommendations, so I would be jumping the gun to declare where we'll come out. So for\nmy remaining remarks I'd like to stick to the personal views I've arrived at over the last year.\nI've concluded that there are common tradeoffs and decision variables that each community must confront. Therefore, the unique circumstances of communities will result in\ndiffering approaches. Each community must find its own model.\nEach community must wrestle with and ultimately take a position on these considerations:\nThe target age and population of children to be addressed by funded programs. Is the focus four-year-olds, or three- and four-year-olds, all children, or underprivileged\nchildren?\n\n\fThe degree of programmatic engagement of parents, particularly in the prenatal stage and the early years.\nThe working definition of quality as well as the ways quality distinctions are communicated to parents. Indications of quality include curriculum content, teacher qualifications,\nchild-teacher ratios, and physical set-up of classrooms.\nThe locus of movement leadership, recognizing that in most communities providers will be a diverse mix of private and public entities and individuals.\nAnd, importantly, the money question. That is, the method and distribution of funding families' access to programs of measured quality.\nIn my view, the reality of the early education landscape in most locales is a public-private partnership, and this arrangement will be the case for some time. The private side\nof this partnership will include for-profit, not-for-profit, faith-based, and secular providers. Bringing common and rising quality standards to this diverse community of providers\nand injecting market mechanisms to ensure there are incentives to improve quality are central challenges.\nSummary case for investment in early education\nI would like to connect the cause of early education to the business community—here in Miami, in Atlanta, or anywhere—but before doing that let me summarize the\ninvestment case.\nAt a high level, there is a compelling macroeconomic case for early childhood education as part of the education continuum. The contribution of education overall to labor\nproductivity growth is estimated in various studies to be between 13 and 30 percent of total growth.\nResearch validates the claim that intervention early in life improves kindergarten readiness, performance in school, and later success in life as indicated by sustained\nemployment, income, and health. Research further supports the claim that investment in early education for underprivileged, otherwise at-risk children yields the highest\nreturn. Some of this return accrues to the individuals as they advance through school and through adulthood. Some return accrues to society in the form of reduced public\nfiscal expenditure for remedial needs. The alternative to quality early education is to spend more down the road on criminal justice and social programs to treat a whole range\nof problems including school dropouts, teen pregnancy, crime, public health, and adult illiteracy.\nIn a recent speech, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke cited the body of research in support of early education. He said this research \"documented the high returns\nthat early childhood programs can pay in terms of subsequent educational attainment and in lower rates of social problems, such as teenage pregnancy and welfare\ndependency.\"\nI know it sounds flippant, but I believe we should view it as a pay now or pay later situation, with the costs of fixing problems associated with failed lives far greater than\ngetting those lives started right at the beginning.\nBusiness interests and business leadership\nBusiness communities across the country have recognized their interest in education in general and in the K-12 public school system in particular. In many major\nmetropolitan areas, there is intense attention being given to fixing the public schools. I'd like to suggest that a second strategy is worth considering. Along with improving the\nK-12 public schools, improve the young students entering the schools. Kindergarten readiness is a legitimate concern. Being behind on day one, with odds against catching\nup, is a portentous handicap for a child.\nI see a definite connection between efforts to improve early education and the long-term economic health of a city, county, or state. Business people understand that their\nenterprises will not prosper in an environment of rampant social problems, shaky public sector finances leading in all probability to rising taxes, and uncompetitive human\ncapital.\nIt is the human capital aspect—the imperative to invest in and upgrade our human capital—that I consider the most profound link to the interests of the business community. I\ndon't need to tell you here in Miami that we now compete in a global economy in which higher-order work—the best jobs—goes to the best educated and trained. We cannot\nwall ourselves off from this reality. Competitive human capital means productive employees, competent and responsive suppliers, and customers with money to spend.\nI'm sure it is the case here in Miami, and I know it is the case in Atlanta, that the business community plays a decisive leadership role in moving vital community initiatives\nforward.\nI've already described the likely persistent reality of a diffused landscape of early education providers, funders, advocacy groups, and interested actors. I believe you in the\nbusiness community can contribute a great deal, especially your skills and understanding in the domains of financial disciplines like return on investment, business-model\nthinking, governance, and competitive market mechanisms.\nI also believe business community leadership and advocacy—because of business's stewardship of the economic welfare of the community—is needed to sustain what\nDavid Lawrence wisely describes as a long-term movement. Investment in children in their earliest years for payback to the individual and community years later requires\nconviction grounded in confidence that the community can organize and execute a strategy in pursuit of a vision that will take time to mature.\nI'll close with this thought: The national economy is now emerging from a very painful episode. As a central banker and economic policymaker, I see the recent financial crisis\nand recession as a wake-up call to think deeply about and then move ahead to build a foundation for sustained economic vitality. I consider early childhood education an\nimportant element of that foundation.\nREFERENCES\nBernanke, Ben. 2007. Education and economic competitiveness.

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nUniversity of South Alabama\nMitchell College of Business Center for Real Estate Studies\nCoastal Economy Outlook\nMobile, Alabama\nSeptember 30, 2009\nFor a long time, we've all endured a barrage of bad news about the national economy. Now—finally, 20 months after the start of the recession—the\nU.S. economy is clearly showing signs of recovery. So today I want to try to answer some questions on many minds: Is the recovery for real? Will it\nlast? How soon will happy days be here again?\nThis will be a speech about how to think about recovery, about how to mix appropriate optimism with a considered approach to weighing positive\nattributes against weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and risks.\nI will begin my remarks by taking stock of the economic situation in the United States along with a few comments on the international economy as it\naffects our country. I will give you my views on the nation's near-term and medium-term outlook and the degree and nature of uncertainty\nsurrounding that outlook.\nThese are my personal views and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nTaking stock\nUnquestionably, the economy is improving. But the vital signs—as captured in macroeconomic data—are mixed. There are pluses and minuses, positives and negatives. It's\nnot a uniform picture. Optimism is warranted but should be tempered by awareness that this is an economy substantially buttressed by a large number of temporary\ngovernment support programs.\nI agree with all who are declaring that a technical recovery is underway. We are technically in recovery when a contracting economy gives way to growth. But even vigorous\ngrowth off a low bottom does not necessarily bring back prior activity levels for some time. By most estimates, it will be the second half of 2010 before the 2007 levels of\nnational output are reached.\nLet me catalog what I believe are both positive notes and areas of weakness.\nA turnaround in the housing market is key to recovery. The housing market has begun to improve as measured by sales volumes, prices, and new home starts. Yet new and\nexisting house inventories remain high, suggesting a weak residential construction outlook. And house sales are being supported by two government programs.\nOne is the first-time homebuyer subsidy—in the form of a tax credit. This program is due to expire at the end of November. The other is the Fed's program of mortgagebacked securities purchases amounting to $1.25 trillion. This program has improved liquidity in a key credit market and helped to maintain mortgage rates at historically\ncompetitive levels, currently below 5 percent for the 30-year qualifying conventional loan.\nThe Fed's execution of purchases of mortgage-backed securities and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency notes is scheduled to run to the end of the first quarter of 2010,\nafter which private investors are expected to power the market.\nHousehold net worth took a big hit in the recession, and as a consequence personal consumption dropped strongly. Of course, there is more to the story of consumption\npullback. Starting in 2007, households began to deleverage, and in recent months the personal savings rate is up substantially.\nRising unemployment and fear of job loss, tighter consumer credit, and the savings/deleveraging phenomenon combined to push consumption down, especially in the\ndurables category. Consumer durables buying has recently improved, but this improvement is associated mostly with the cash-for-clunkers incentive in support of auto\npurchases.\nThe effect of this program drove an uptick in recent manufacturing numbers. Industrial production turned higher in July and August after eight straight months of decline.\nWhile output gains were most notable in the auto industry, modest production growth has been seen across a broader set of industries as well.\nStock market gains along with higher savings and stabilization of house prices have begun to restore some household net worth lost since this crisis began in 2007. It is\nestimated that American households saw $14 trillion dissipate, largely from stock market losses and house price deterioration through the first quarter of 2009. This loss\nrepresents more than 20 percent of their net worth. About $2 trillion was recouped in the second quarter of 2009, primarily from market appreciation. And stock market and\nhouse price appreciation have added to these gains in the third quarter.\nA moment ago, I mentioned the pall cast over the economy by rising unemployment. When I joined the Fed in March 2007, the national unemployment rate stood at 4.5\npercent. Today the rate is 9.7 percent and likely to rise from here before beginning to fall.\nThe consensus among forecasters is something approaching a jobless recovery. The administration's stimulus program has helped soften the pace of job loss. But a recent\ninquiry of Southeast state budget officials, conducted by the Atlanta Fed, suggested much of the benefit, in infrastructure construction at least, has been front-ended in 2009\nand early 2010.\n\n\fNonetheless, the pace of job loss is slowing. Nonfarm payrolls fell by 216,000 in August. Analysts expect that the September report due out Friday will show a decline of\n180,000. This level of job loss is an improvement in comparison to nearly 600,000 jobs lost in an average month in the first half of this year.\nBusiness spending for capital goods and inventory retrenched dramatically in the recession. Businesses remain very cautious about spending on equipment and software.\nThis category of spending fell at an annual rate of nearly 8.5 percent in the second quarter of 2009 after tumbling almost 37 percent in the first quarter.\nThe data still suggest businesses are trimming these investments, but the pace of decline slowed substantially in the first two months of the third quarter. And while\ninventories continue to be liquidated, the pace of liquidation is slowing. At some point, inventory replenishment is likely to begin at some level.\nA surprisingly positive factor in the current domestic economy and outlook is the global economy. A worldwide recovery is materializing, led by the developing economies of\nEast Asia and India. Data released last week indicate that global trade increased at its fastest pace in five years. Foreign demand is expected to add about 1.3 percentage\npoints to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter once the final numbers are calculated. But it should be said that this resurgence also reflects sizeable\ngovernment stimulus spending, the effect of which, like here in the United States, is transitory.\nFinancial markets\nImproving financial markets are providing support for recovery. Most large-scale credit markets are functioning much better, and I believe an array of policy actions taken by\nthe Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury, and other agencies, taken together, has reversed much of the financial market dysfunction that fueled the recession.\nAt this juncture, interbank funding has returned almost to the precrisis normal, and the corporate bond markets have improved markedly. The important asset-backed\nsecurities market—the market that ultimately finances pools of car loans, student loans, small business loans, and credit card receivables—has seen issuance volume\nsteadily return. But it should be pointed out that progress in the securitization markets has depended, to date, largely on a Federal Reserve support program.\nIn contrast, the flow of credit through the U.S. banking system is not yet approaching anyone's notion of normal. For the three months through June, U.S. commercial bank\nloans fell sharply for the second straight quarter despite a surge in mortgage refinances. Banks too have been deleveraging and repairing their balance sheets. A return to\nrobust bank lending is unlikely, at least in the near term.\nThe banking system is healing, but it will take time. Banks across the spectrum of size have received liquidity and capital support from several Federal Reserve, Treasury,\nand Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) programs. Many of these programs are winding down as banks turn to alternative sources of funds that are more cost\neffective.\nCommercial real estate\nI want to draw attention to a developing risk that could set back the progress being made by banks. That is commercial real estate. The recession weakened the\nfundamentals of all segments of commercial real estate (retail, office, hotel, warehouse, and—sometimes included—multifamily residential). Vacancies have risen, rents have\nfallen because of vacancies and renegotiations, and capitalization rates (the discount rate used to calculate value) have risen. This combination of factors has caused\nproperty values to fall, in some cases dramatically. Since banks and securities markets lend against the value of properties, loan-to-value ratios have deteriorated. As loans\ncome due, or as loan defaults occur, restitution of sound lending ratios has to happen. If not, loans must be written down.\nIn mid-September the Atlanta Fed held a one-day conference on commercial real estate involving investors, developers, bankers, and academics. Panelists made several\npoints worthy of mention.\nFirst, panelists said commercial real estate follows employment or, stated differently, recovery of commercial real estate is job-growth dependent. I've already commented\nthat the recovery—the early stages, at least—might not bring much employment growth.\nLots of commercial construction is still in process, and until growth of supply stops, the industry statistics will continue to deteriorate. Panelists also said loss recognition by\nlenders has to occur for capital to return to the commercial real estate sector. Some panelists in the conference spoke derisively of what they termed \"extend and pretend\"\nand \"delay and pray\" measures on the part of both banks and regulators.\nFinally, the worst is ahead of us, not behind us, according to participants.\nI'm sharing these qualitative assessments of the situation to give you a sense of opinions expressed by very credible participants in a conference held just two weeks ago.\nEconomic outlook\nAs I said at the start, the economy is definitely improving, but the signals we're getting in the macroeconomic data are mixed. I expect we'll see a growth number when the\nthird quarter is totaled up, so the economy is in recovery. But will it last? Let me give you my take on the outlook.\nIf you look at history, recoveries following a deep recession have more often than not been quite strong. The broad consensus among forecasters is this recovery will be\nweak in comparison. But even within that consensus there is diverse opinion about the speed and path by which the economy will reach its full potential for growth.\nBased on recent information, we at the Atlanta Fed have been raising our estimates of near-term growth, but we remain cautious about assuming much strength in the\nmedium term. There is too much uncertainty at the moment to project happy days almost here again.\nTo elaborate, I see as uncertain the time required for the housing market to return to health, the potential commercial real estate drag on the financial system, the\nsustainability of recovery in the absence of government supports, and the resurgence of private demand.\nI would be remiss if I failed to comment on the inflation outlook. As a central banker, I am always concerned with inflation prospects, and certainly constant vigilance is\nrequired. At present, inflationary pressures seem well contained. Recent inflation measures have been benign, inflation expectations of the public are stable as best we can\ntell, and my business contacts tell me they and their suppliers have very little pricing power in this environment.\nFurther, the concern expressed in some quarters over the growth last year of base elements of the money supply—namely, excess bank reserves and the Fed's balance\nsheet—strikes me as exaggerated. When the time comes, I am confident the Fed has the tools to reverse the assumed monetary stimulus and exit the policies put in place in\n\n\freaction to the financial crisis and the recession.\nMeasured optimism\nI do not think that time has yet come, and to be consistent with my outlook, I think it may well be some time before a comprehensive exit need be under way. I support the\nmaintenance of interest rates at low levels \"for an extended period,\" as the FOMC has communicated in its public statements. Assuming stable inflation, I would like to see\nmore evidence of private activity in the economy before advocating change in the Fed's overall monetary policy stance.\nWe all ardently want to believe the nation is on the economic comeback trail. I don't think we are served by declaring prematurely that we're in the clear, nor by overweighting\nthe lagging data and the risks. In thinking about the recovery, I recommend for now a mindset of measured optimism.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed Speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nFederal Reserve Independence in a Global Context\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nWorld Affairs Council of Jacksonville\nJacksonville, Florida\nSeptember 10, 2009\nThere are around 90 active world affairs councils in the United States keeping their cities’ business and government leaders abreast of world\ndevelopments. Some serve a vital purpose of education and information directly pertinent to the economic welfare of the city and its hinterlands. I\nconsider the World Affairs Council of Jacksonville one of those. Jacksonville—with its important and growing port—makes a meaningful portion of\nits living from global exchange. The state of the world economy matters to Jacksonville.\nToday, I will discuss the U.S. economic situation along with developments in the global economy as they affect this country’s economic interests. I'll\nput forward a current assessment of the nation’s policy challenges using a framework familiar to country risk analysts. And I'll connect this analysis\nto the issue of central bank independence, an issue that is drawing serious attention as a result of the financial crisis and actions taken in response.\nIt's important that I emphasize that the views I'll express are my own and don’t necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\nStatus and forecast—U.S. economy\nTo lay the groundwork for this discussion, I'll begin with an overview of the current state of the U.S. economy. Overall, the U.S. economy is improving but still fragile.\nStabilization is proceeding, and the first stages of recovery are under way.\nIt is to be expected at a time like this that the vital signs of the economy are mixed. Some indicators are improving while others are not getting worse or are just declining at a\nslower pace. Let me detail some of the key signals we’re getting from the domestic economy.\nAlthough consumer confidence is rising, actual consumption has remained muted overall. Consumers remain cautious because of employment concerns and wealth loss.\nFinancing for consumer durable goods purchases is tight. Households continue to deleverage—that is, pay down debt. The savings rate is high compared with recent years.\nFor now, an atmosphere of frugality and self-restraint seems to have set in.\nManufacturing production numbers improved in July after eight months of decline, but this performance mostly reflects a surge in auto production, perhaps in anticipation of\nthe \"Cash for Clunkers\" program.\nInventories were liquidated aggressively during the first half of the year. The most recent survey of purchasing managers showed a slowing of liquidation. My view is that\nsome replenishment may be under way—notably auto inventories. But many businesses learned during the recession how to operate with leaner stocks.\nSales of both new and existing homes rose in August, and prices are up a little, according to the Case-Shiller index of 20 major real estate markets. However, regional\ninformation gathered by the Atlanta Fed across the Southeast is not uniformly upbeat.\nLast week's labor market report for August showed that the economy is still shedding jobs. The United States lost 216,000 jobs in August, and the unemployment rate rose to\n9.7 percent—the highest since June 1983.\nRegarding inflation, the headline inflation rate has fallen over the last year in part because of lower oil prices compared with a year ago. Core measures of inflation excluding\nfood and energy costs also have been drifting lower, currently measured at 1.5 percent. With continuing economic weakness and financial uncertainty, firms have very little\npricing power. I've tested this thesis in conversations with business leaders in this region with very little pushback. I expect inflation will remain contained for some time.\nAs I said, the picture is mixed, but stabilization and recovery appear to be taking hold.\nRecent improvements in the financial sector are supporting economic stabilization. Trust among financial institutions has been restored as reflected by risk spreads in the\ninterbank lending market. With the support of a Federal Reserve lending program, securitization of credit card receivables, auto paper, and student loans has bounced back\nto almost precrisis levels. Corporate bond issuance has been strong since the beginning of the year. Overall, capital flows reflect an unwinding of the near-total retreat from\nrisk-taking and the flight to safety that occurred last fall. Despite this improved flow of capital to riskier assets, financial conditions are still vulnerable, and the flow of credit\nremains constrained.\nOften a deep recession is followed by a sharp rebound in business and overall economic activity. As I look ahead, at least beyond the third quarter, I do not foresee this\ntrajectory. Over the medium term, I see a slow recovery with ongoing repair of the financial sector and structural adjustments in the broad economy.\nThere are risks to even this lackluster outlook. One risk I'm watching is the interplay of commercial real estate and the financial sector. Commercial real estate values across\nthe spectrum of property types—retail, office, hotel, warehouse—have fallen as a result of the recession. These values back loans held by banks and also by nonbank\nfinancial institutions and holders of commercial mortgage-backed securities. Maturing loans will bring the deterioration of lending ratios to a head.\nStatus and forecast—international economy\nLet me now turn to the international economy. Last fall, the financial crisis in the United States quickly spread to the rest of the world through trade and financial linkages. As\na result, the world economy fell into the worst recession since World War II.\n\n\fThe global economy is now emerging from a recession with the help of unprecedented monetary and fiscal support. Europe is expecting slightly improved performance in the\nshort term, although the strength of the European economy is uncertain beyond an immediate rebound. China and other developing countries in Asia are leading the global\nrecovery. Rising domestic demand and imports in China are contributing to economic recovery in export-oriented economies in Asia and elsewhere in the world.\nIf it was ever the case that the fortunes of the U.S. economy were decoupled from the rest of the world, it is no longer so. In 1968 total trade (the sum of exports and imports)\nwas about 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). By 1988 trade amounted to about 15 percent. As of last year, exports and imports together had risen to over 28\npercent of GDP.\nThe impact of increasing openness extends beyond markets for goods and services. The globalization of financial markets has been as important as—if not more important\nthan—the globalization of product markets. According to McKinsey & Co., total global capital flows rose from $1 trillion in 1990 to $11 trillion in 2007.\nBecause the United States runs a chronic trade deficit, foreign sources represent a considerable portion of the financing for the U.S. economy. Nonresident investors own\nnearly half of U.S. Treasury securities outstanding, 11 percent of U.S. equities, over 20 percent of U.S. corporate bonds, and about 15 percent of mortgage agency bonds.\nAlthough U.S. exports declined considerably in this recession and only now have begun to recover, the drop in imports was even larger. As a result, the U.S. current account\nand trade deficits narrowed somewhat. If this trend holds, the United States would become less reliant on the rest of the world for financing our public sector deficit as well as\noverall consumption.\nCountry risk exposure evaluation of the United States\nI began my career as an international banker in the Middle East. As a young banker I was taught the techniques of country risk and country exposure evaluation. I remember\nwell the speeches and lectures of some of the seasoned graybeards of my bank.\nThey taught that analysis begins with measurement of the relative growth of a country’s public sector versus its private sector. If the public sector is growing, one should\ndetermine how that growth is being financed. Is the government raising taxes or improving tax collection? Or is the government borrowing? If debt financing, is the\ngovernment borrowing from domestic sources in local currency or from external sources in foreign currency? If borrowing externally, what are the ratings trends of the\ncountry’s sovereign debt, and what seems to be the direction of creditor attitude and appetite?\nVery importantly, if the country is financing government spending domestically, is the balance sheet of the central bank growing, and does it appear that the central bank is\nmonetizing the growing public sector debt, perhaps under political pressure? Monetizing means issuing new money to buy the government’s debt. And how independently\ndoes the central bank appear to be operating?\nIf—from this analysis—we saw a picture of a public sector growing relative to the private sector, with that growth resulting from deficit spending, and that deficit spending\nbeing largely financed by the central bank monetizing new government debt, the conclusion was…do not increase the bank's exposure and do not go long on the country's\ncurrency.\nI was first exposed to this framework for analysis more than 30 years ago. I think it is still a sound framework. So, for our edification, let's apply this framework to the United\nStates. Let’s ask, what is our reality today within this framework?\nDuring the recession—over the last six quarters—total federal government outlays as a share of GDP grew from just under 5 percent to about 6.4 percent of GDP.\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the 2009 federal deficit will be about $1.6 trillion, or 11.2 percent of GDP. One international benchmark is 3 percent.\nThis is the ratio required to qualify as a new member of the European Monetary Union.\nTo finance federal deficits, the Treasury is issuing new debt. In 2009, the U.S. Treasury will issue about $1.7 trillion of net U.S. new debt. According to the Economist\nIntelligence Unit (EIU), this country’s national debt-to-GDP ratio will be 51 percent this year, up from 38 percent last year and is projected to reach 79 percent by 2013.\nBy comparison, the European Union's debt-to-GDP ratio was higher than the United States’ before the crisis and is expected to rise to nearly 90 percent by 2013. Among\nmajor developed economies, Japan is by far the most indebted. Its debt-to-GDP ratio reached 100 percent in 1997 and is forecast to hit 200 percent by 2011. By contrast,\ndeveloping countries are much less indebted. For the group as a whole, debt-to-GDP ratio is not expected to rise above 35 percent.\nDespite the recent growth in U.S. public indebtedness, the level of debt is still manageable. But the trend is unsustainable and in a less stable country would spell trouble. I\nam confident that we will return to a sustainable fiscal path, a judgment apparently shared by financial market participants that continue to absorb U.S. debt at quite low rates\nof return.\nHowever, it would be unwise to be Panglossian about the current stance of policy, and this includes monetary policy. As I noted earlier, one of the key questions of country\nrisk analysis is whether it appears that the central bank is monetizing the growing public sector debt, perhaps under political pressure.\nHere we are fortunate that both developed and developing countries have absorbed the hard lessons of history. For the most part, they have adopted institutional\narrangements that enhance the credibility of central banks in their efforts to maintain low and stable rates of inflation, even in the face of significant fiscal pressures. In the\nUnited States, such credibility has allowed the Federal Reserve, Congress, and Treasury the flexibility to aggressively respond to the financial crisis without a potentially\ndestructive unleashing of inflation expectations. And, thanks to operational independence, the Fed is not in a situation of monetizing the federal debt.\nStable inflation expectations and credibility are not guaranteed. The circumstances that promote stable expectations—particularly in an environment with rapidly rising fiscal\ndeficits and large injections of liquidity—arise by design, not by accident. Though the details of central bank design differ somewhat from country to country, experience\nclearly points to independence, accountability, and transparency as the key building blocks.\nIndependence, transparency, and the decentralized Federal Reserve System\nTo build on this theme, I believe central bank independence in the conduct of monetary policy can appropriately be considered an enduring principle of sound governance of\nany country or political entity that issues a currency. I came to believe this many years ago, long before I joined the Federal Reserve.\n\n\fCentral bank independence correlates well with low and stable inflation, which correlates with sustainable economic growth that maximizes employment. Those two very\ndesirable outcomes, not surprisingly, also happen to be the congressional mandates for the Federal Reserve.\nOver the past 15 years or so, institutional reforms designed to give central banks more independence to pursue price stability have been introduced around the world with\ngreat success.\nIn 1990, the EIU estimated that average inflation in the world was 40 percent. By 2000, it was 4.3 percent. This year, world inflation is expected to be a mere 2 percent—very\nclose to what many consider price stability.\nIt's no surprise I’m an advocate of central bank independence in the formulation of monetary policy. But the independence of a central bank cannot be sustained without a\nclear and deliberate regime of accountability to the public and their representatives. That regime requires what I call defined transparency. By this I mean formal reporting and\ncommunication practices that are sufficiently comprehensive and appropriately timely to balance process integrity with the value of open government.\nLet's consider where we are today. Central banks around the world now publish their objectives, publicly communicate their policy actions, and speak freely and openly in\npublic forums. In the case of the Federal Reserve, the chairman testifies semiannually on monetary policy, policy decisions are announced in a release immediately following\nan FOMC meeting, and the minutes of those meetings are reported on an expedited basis. The Fed also now publishes quarterly forecasts.\nAlso, the Fed publishes its balance sheet on a weekly basis and provides annually a detailed report on the financial activities of the Federal Reserve that are audited by an\nindependent public accounting firm. In addition, the Government Accountability Office audits the Federal Reserve across all its operations with the exception of, importantly,\nmonetary policy.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve System has a characteristic that is somewhat unique among central banks of the world. The system has a decentralized structure whereby\nregional, independent Reserve Banks, under the broad supervision of politically appointed governors in Washington, D.C., jointly set policy.\nThis decentralized structure, in my view, greatly enhances both the independence of the system and its transparency.\nRegional representation at the policy table provides a means for all corners of this diverse nation to weigh in on the important monetary issues influencing the economy.\nReserve Banks gather economic intelligence from around their districts representing the varied views and interests of our respective regions. And Reserve Banks are well\npositioned to bring important information back home again, communicating the Fed’s objectives in a way that enhances the understanding of their rationale.\nI strongly advocate this notion of defined transparency, which I mentioned a moment ago. I’ve seen firsthand the delicacy of the policy role the Federal Reserve plays\nopposite markets and financial institutions. The events of the last two years have exposed the fragile edifice of financial stability.\nI think the principles of transparency that should apply to the making of monetary policy include the following: Disclosure that does not do systemic harm. Disclosure that\ndoes not tend to shorten policy time horizons and open the monetary policy process to short-term political considerations. And, disclosure that does encourage a relationship\nof trust, confidence, and credibility between the public and the central bank.\nIn my view, the public interest resides in policies that influence the economy over the longer term, address economic fundamentals, and are politically neutral. I welcome\nfurther discussion on ways the Fed can be more accountable and transparent but always within the context of maintaining the monetary policy independence that has proven\neffective in the pursuit of broad economic goals.\nIn striking the right balance of independence, accountability, and transparency, we must also remain mindful of the global role of the dollar and the worldwide distribution of\nour obligations. I believe the independence of the Federal Reserve is crucial to the world’s perception that the United States will continue to pursue responsible monetary\npolicy. This perception is an essential underpinning of a calm, reasoned, and favorable assessment of U.S. country risk.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThe U.S. Economy and the Employment Challenge\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nChattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce\nChattanooga, Tennessee\nAugust 26, 2009\nThe last time I was here I delivered a speech to the Rotary Club of Chattanooga in late March of 2008. Since that time, the economic situation has\nchanged dramatically.\nA year and a half ago, as you recall, the U.S. economy was clearly slowing. But it wasn't yet apparent that we were in the midst of a deep and\nprotracted recession. Also, a major financial crisis was not part of the outlook.\nNow, evidence is mounting that the worst of the economic downturn is behind us. Today, I will talk about the economic situation and outlook at this\njuncture. I also want to take a deeper look into a critical economic issue for many Americans—and that is employment. The views I will express\ntoday are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nCurrent state of national economy\nLet me begin with the current state of the economy. Overall, the U.S. economy is improving but still fragile. Stabilization has taken hold, and the beginning stages of recovery\nare under way, in my view.\nConsumer spending has been dampened by housing market weakness and concerns about employment.\nThe attitude among the business leaders I talk to is quite cautious. Investment spending this year has declined sharply, but, according to recent data, the speed of falloff\nappears to be slowing. Also, inventories have been liquidated aggressively in the first half of the year.\nRecent improvements in the financial sector are supporting economic stabilization. Capital flows and securities issuance reflect an unwinding of the flight to safety that\noccurred last fall. Despite this improved flow of capital to riskier assets, I would say that financial conditions are still vulnerable, and the flow of credit remains weak.\nI'm concerned that commercial real estate weakness poses a serious potential risk to the economic recovery and to the banking system. Commercial real estate loan\nexposure is heavily concentrated in banks and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Commercial real estate values—that is, collateral values for loans—are being revised\ndown materially by the potent combination of increased vacancy, rent reductions, and appropriately higher capitalization rates. Further, there is a clear link between\nemployment trends (positive and negative) and commercial real estate trends.\nAs regards inflation, with continuing economic weakness and financial uncertainty, firms have very little pricing power. Headline inflation has fallen in part because of lower oil\nprices compared with a year ago. Core measures of inflation excluding food and energy costs also have been drifting lower. Looking ahead, I expect inflation will remain\ncontained.\nOutlook\nWith respect to growth, my forecast envisions a return to positive but subdued gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the medium term weighed down by significant\nadjustments to our economy. Some of these adjustments are transitional in the sense that they impede the usual forces of recovery. Among these are the rewiring of the\nfinancial sector and the need for households to save more to repair their balance sheets.\nSome of these adjustments, however, are more \"structural\" in nature. By this, I mean that the economy that emerges from this recession may not fully resemble the\nprerecession economy. In my view, it is unlikely that we will see a return of jobs lost in certain sectors, such as manufacturing. In a similar vein, the recession has been so\ndeep in construction that a reallocation of workers is likely to happen—even if not permanent. I'll discuss manufacturing and construction a bit more in a moment.\nMy forecast for a slow recovery implies a protracted period of high unemployment. And labor market weakness is a concern I hear about often as I travel around the\nSoutheast. Given this concern, I'd like to devote the remainder of my formal remarks to the challenge of unemployment and the potential for a jobless recovery.\nUnderemployment\nThis recession has had a severe impact on employment in various ways: jobs, furloughs, and number of hours worked. For example, the average manufacturing workweek\nhas fallen below 40 hours for the first time since 1983. And the number of workers employed part-time for economic reasons has increased more in this recession than in any\nsince the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) started tracking that information.\nIf one considers the people who would like a job but have stopped looking—so-called discouraged workers—and those who are working fewer hours than they want, the\nunemployment rate would move from the official 9.4 percent to 16 percent.\nWhere job losses occurred\nWhile the unemployment pain in this recession has been broad based, certain sectors have been hit particularly hard. I've already mentioned the most prominent cases,\nconstruction and manufacturing. Both fields employ a disproportionate number of men. As a result, some have called this a \"mancession.\"\nThe share of the jobs lost in construction and manufacturing is out of proportion to the share of jobs represented by these male-dominated sectors. Prior to the recession,\nconstruction and manufacturing together accounted for a little more than 15 percent of employment. Their job losses during the recession, however, account for more than 40\n\n\fpercent of all U.S. job losses. While men typically have borne most of the job losses during a recession, this recession ranks among the worst.\nSlow recovery\nClearly, it will be some time before the number of jobs in the economy returns to prerecession levels.\nThe higher share of part-time employment arguably gives employers a means to increase work hours without adding to the overall number of full-time workers. Businesses\nseem inclined to defer hiring and focus on productivity until a sustained pick-up in top-line demand is beyond doubt.\nFirms always have incentives to improve efficiency and keep a lid on costs—including labor costs. The last two recoveries have involved unusually long periods of GDP\ngrowth accomplished through productivity gains instead of employment growth. At this point, there is scant evidence that the coming recovery will break that pattern.\nThe sectors in which job losses have been most pronounced are unlikely to see a rapid return to prerecession levels of business activity, let alone prerecession levels of\nemployment. Construction, which represents about 6 percent of employment, has seen a recent activity uptick in the residential category from very low levels. But the\ninventory of unsold homes on the market is elevated. Much of this inventory will have to be absorbed before construction employment returns to any levels we might consider\n\"normal.\" Industry capacity before the recession approached 2 million housing starts on an annual basis. Starts are now hovering around 580,000.\nUnfortunately, time may not return manufacturing employment to prerecession levels. Between 1965 and 2000, manufacturing employment generally fluctuated between 16.5\nand 19.5 million jobs. The number of manufacturing jobs fell to just over 14 million in the first years of this decade and has continued to drift downward. The harsh financial\nconstraints of this recession appear to have accelerated this secular decline.\nSolutions to the unemployment problem\nThe country's employment problems are not completely intractable. Fortunately, most who are directly affected by job loss are eligible for the short-term income support of\nunemployment insurance. Benefits through that program have been extended three times since July 2008 and may be extended again.\nFor many workers, unemployment benefits provide much-needed income support to see them through a difficult job market. Some workers will have to look for a job in a new\nfield. There are some powerful forces in place that can assist those workers who need to make career changes—labor market flexibility and an educational infrastructure well\nsuited to retraining workers.\nFirst, with respect to labor market flexibility, the easier it is for workers to change employers, the faster structural adjustment can occur. U.S. workers have become\naccustomed to changing jobs. The BLS estimates that the youngest baby boomers had almost nine different jobs by the time they reached the age of 42.\nAlong with worker flexibility, worker retraining programs can also facilitate necessary adjustments. Community colleges serve an important role in preparing \"nontraditional,\"\noften older, students for new careers and in providing targeted training on a contract basis with private companies.\nIn the fall of 2007, more than a third of all postsecondary students were enrolled in community colleges, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Since the\nearly 1960s, enrollment in community colleges increased by about 750 percent—roughly four times the growth rate of enrollment in public and private four-year institutions.\nThe role that community colleges play in retooling the workforce can be seen by the bumps in enrollment during recessions. Also, enrollment in for-profit educational\ninstitutions has increased from only about 1.5 percent of postsecondary students in 1990 to about 7 percent more recently.\nIn recognition that many of the nation's unemployed will need to retool to re-enter the labor market, approximately $24 billion of federal stimulus money was allocated for\ntraining and education, according to the Workforce Alliance.\nHow Chattanooga is poised for recovery\nWith respect to our national employment challenge, Chattanooga offers a useful example—and perhaps a preview—of how labor markets will adjust as recovery takes hold.\nSince 1990, Chattanooga's employment situation has typically beaten that of the United States. But in this recession Chattanooga has been sharing the national pain. Like\nthe nation as a whole, Chattanooga has seen a disproportionate share of job losses in construction and manufacturing.\nFortunately for this area, top employers also include health and long-term care insurance companies, health care providers, and health care educators. Officials project one\nof the fastest-growing employment sectors through 2016 will be health care. Chattanooga should benefit from this growth coming out of the recession, and the local health\ncare insurance industry is also poised for more demand with the aging of the U.S. population.\nBut Chattanooga can boast of something unusual in today's economy: new manufacturing jobs. As you know, the new Volkswagen plant is expected to add some 2,000\nmanufacturing jobs to the local economy by 2011. This development runs counter to national trends, as I've already explained.\nPolicy issues\nIf my prognosis for the broad economy is correct, the pace of job restoration and growth through the medium term will be frustratingly slow. So, what can be done to address\nthe prospect of high unemployment and underemployment?\nFurther fiscal stimulus has been mentioned, but the full effects of the first stimulus package are not yet clear, and the concern over adding to the federal deficit and the\nresulting national debt is warranted.\nThe FOMC has stated its intention to keep the policy interest rate low for an extended period. I agree that this approach is needed. This policy stance should encourage more\nbusiness activity and facilitate more hiring.\nNo policy is certain to improve outcomes, and no policy is without risks. The challenge my colleagues and I face is navigating between the risk that early removal of monetary\nstimulus snuffs out the recovery and the risk that protracted monetary accommodation stokes inflation expectations that could ultimately fuel unwelcome inflationary\npressures.\n\n\fThe Fed must deal with this tension, particularly in coming quarters, as we pursue our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. I believe the overriding\nconcern should be the quality of recovery as opposed to the speed of recovery. The best answer to unemployment is restoration of a healthy, balanced, and growing\neconomy capable of producing sustainable employment. This objective will require structural adjustment in the economy and personal adjustment for many workers.\nI believe the economic outlook—including the employment picture—calls for continuing efforts to remove obstacles to the rebuilding of economic strength on solid\nfoundations. Chief among such obstacles is the still-constricted bank and securitization credit system, especially those segments that finance small business and\nhouseholds.\nI also believe progressive local community leaders can play a role in addressing the unemployment challenge. Beyond recruiting inbound investment that brings immediate\njobs, you as local leaders can continue to pursue a human capital agenda for your region. By this, I mean initiatives to advance early childhood pre-K education for three- and\nfour-year-olds, improvement of the public K–12 system, and backing of the community and technical college infrastructure that is so vital to worker skill development and\nretooling.\nI do not expect quick fixes for the unemployment challenge ahead, but I am convinced the right policy objective is sustainable employment growing out of a recovery that is\ngrounded in durable and resilient fundamentals.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nOn the Economic Outlook and the Commitment to Price Stability\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRotary Club of Nashville\nNashville, Tennessee\nJuly 20, 2009\nFor my remarks this afternoon, I'll talk about how I see the economy at this juncture, the near- and medium-term outlook, and the growing concern\nabout inflation. Let me add at this point my usual disclaimer that my remarks are my thoughts alone and may not necessarily reflect the views of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nIt's especially important that I mention this caveat the day before Chairman Ben Bernanke makes his semiannual monetary policy report to\nCongress. Tomorrow the chairman will speak for the Federal Reserve System. Today, I am speaking just for myself, informed by advice from my\ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\nCurrent economy\nCurrent economic conditions are mixed at best, but the economy appears to be in stabilization mode. Stabilization necessarily precedes recovery. A\nrecovery has not yet taken hold but should begin before too long.\nI'll start with a look at manufacturing, which has been hard hit in this recession. Just last week we learned that manufacturing production was down 0.6 percent in June,\nmonth over month. In the past year, manufacturers have cut production by more than 15 percent, and the manufacturing capacity utilization rate dropped to about 65 percent,\na record low.\nHere in middle Tennessee, manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of employment. The number of manufacturing jobs here declined by about 12 percent on a yearover-year basis in May, the most recent data available. I know that many of you here today have directly felt the troubles in this important sector.\nRecent indicators of business investment are also down but are a bit less discouraging. Durable goods orders increased this spring and in May reached the highest levels in\nfour months. On the other hand, the most recent data showed the liquidation of business inventories continuing, but the pace has slowed.\nConsumer spending absorbs about two-thirds of economic output, and the recent picture in this area is mostly negative. After taking price changes into account, it appears\nthat retail spending fell again in June. Restaurants, department stores, and building materials retailers all posted month-to-month declines. Overall, retail results are in line\nwith the ongoing weakness in consumer spending we have been seeing.\nThere is also indication of worsening consumer confidence. The University of Michigan's July report indicated that consumer sentiment fell sharply in recent weeks, reversing\nthe gains seen in May and June. Growing consumer pessimism has been reported in other survey data. It appears that expectations of future economic conditions, and\nparticularly employment prospects, are weighing on attitudes.\nAs for housing, permits and new home starts in June improved markedly compared with previous months, and the large inventory of houses for sale has been pared back\nsomewhat. But the housing sector is still under great stress. Reflecting a persistent pace of foreclosures, the percentage of distressed sales remains high—about one in\nthree sales in May. All in all, this information suggests a slower pace of decline in a still weak residential sector.\nData on the overall economy suggest the same trend of slowing decline. I, along with my team in Atlanta, believe real gross domestic product (GDP) fell slightly in the second\nquarter. This performance represents substantial progress coming off a contraction of 5.5 percent (annualized) in the first quarter.\nThe most recent monthly labor market report was disappointing, but employment tends to lag improvements in economic performance. Nothing in the incoming data has\naltered our view that the economy is nearing a bottom and will soon begin a very slow recovery.\nFinancial market healing\nIf stabilization is to lead to sustained recovery, the health of financial markets is crucial. In this regard, I see notable signs of improvement.\nFor example, most short-term money markets have seen rising volume, increased liquidity, and less concern with counterparty risk.\nIn the corporate bond market, spreads have declined and lowered the cost of capital for investment-grade businesses.\nOur credit markets include both banks and the very important securitization markets. Securitization markets have been coming back gradually from a base late last year of\nnearly zero. Total asset-backed security issuance in the second quarter of 2009 was $49 billion, which is 14 times larger than during the frozen market conditions of the fourth\nquarter of 2008.\nEquity markets were up globally in the second quarter. While the calendar of initial public offerings remains weak, stock issuance in the second quarter tripled compared with\nthe first quarter of 2009 and hit the highest level for the past year and a half.\nMuch of the recent equity issuance activity was capital raises of large banks. It's positive news that the banks participating in the so-called stress tests have raised a\nsubstantial portion of the required capital. Some banks have begun repaying their Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds to the U.S. Treasury. Also, use of the Fed's\nspecial credit facilities has fallen by $500 billion since March of this year.\n\n\fDespite this progress, the financial sector remains in a fragile state. So far this year, 57 U.S. banks have failed, including 13 in the Southeast. Banks in this region suffer from\noverconcentration of loans backed by residential and commercial real estate.\nOutlook\nNow, let me speak to the question of the outlook from here. Often a deep recession is followed by a sharp rebound in business and overall economic activity. Unfortunately,\nas I look ahead, I do not foresee this trajectory. I expect real growth to resume in the second half and progress at a modest pace. I do not see a strong recovery in the\nmedium term.\nThere are risks to even this rather subdued forecast. The risk I'm watching most closely is commercial real estate. There is a heavy schedule of commercial real estate\nfinancings coming due in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The CMBS (commercial real estate mortgage-backed securities) market is very weak, and banks generally have no appetite\nto roll over loans on properties that have lost value in the recession. Refinancing problems will not directly affect GDP—it's commercial construction that factors into GDP—\nbut I'm concerned problems in commercial real estate finance could adversely affect the otherwise improving banking and insurance sectors.\nRemoving obstacles to growth\nI'd like to elaborate further on my thinking regarding this forecast of an anemic recovery in the medium term. I will argue that growth is the natural state for the U.S. economy,\nand growth in the medium term will be slowed by structural impediments that must be removed or attenuated.\nGrowth is the natural state because market competition requires continuous innovation—product innovation, technological innovation, new business models, and\ndevelopment of new markets. Businesspeople—especially those in publicly held companies—understand that over the longer term it's either grow or disappear.\nIt follows then that resumption and acceleration of growth depends on removal of obstacles. By obstacles, I mean conditions that get in the way of a natural pace of growth.\nI see a number of obstacles whose removal will take some time. For example, the healing of the banking system will take time. Working off excess housing inventory will take\ntime. The reallocation of labor to productive and growing sectors of the economy will take time. It will take time to complete the deleveraging of American households and the\nrestoration of consumer balance sheets.\nIn short, I believe the economy must undergo significant structural adjustments. We're coming out of a severe recession, and it's not too much an exaggeration to say the\neconomy is undergoing a makeover. We must build a more solid foundation for our economy than consumer spending fueled by excessive credit—excessive household\nleverage—built on a house price bubble.\nThe surviving financial system must find a new posture of risk taking. The balance of consumption and investment must adjust, with investment being financed by greater\ndomestic saving. The distribution of employment must adjust to match worker skills, including newly acquired skills, with jobs in growth markets. Some industrial plant and\nequipment must be taken offline to remove excess and higher-cost capacity.\nAs I said, these adjustments will take time and will suppress growth prospects in the process. I believe the economy will underperform its long-term potential for a while\nbecause of the obstacles to growth that must be removed, adjustments it must undergo.\nMany observers see substantial slack in the economy that could persist for some years. Economists' more formal term for slack is “output gap.” We at the Atlanta Fed see a\nmeaningful output gap developing, but in our view it is smaller than would normally be associated with the weak pace of growth we expect over the next couple of years\nbecause all the obstacles to the natural pace of growth already mentioned have brought down the economy's potential for the medium term.\nInflation risks\nThis observation leads me to some comments on inflation.\nThe inflation statistics have fluctuated in recent months, mainly as a result of volatile energy prices. But the most recent core inflation indicators continue to point to an\ninflation trend somewhere just below 2 percent—not much different from where it has been for some time now.\nAt this juncture, my assessment is that inflationary and deflationary risks are roughly balanced.\nI don't believe businesses, broadly speaking, have much pricing power. I'm hearing this belief anecdotally. Recently, our regional executives asked a wide range of business\ncontacts in the Southeast about their ability to raise prices in this economy. The great majority of respondents reported that they were not able to raise prices, and some are\nhaving to renegotiate contracts to lower prices.\nStill, I recognize that concerns about inflation risks have recently risen in some quarters, and I would like to comment on those concerns.\nInflation pessimists—those predicting alarmingly higher inflation—point to growing federal deficits and the substantial growth of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet since\nlast October. More precisely, they note the enormous increase of excess bank reserves on the liability side of the Fed's balance sheet. The argument is that surely this rapid\ngrowth of the monetary base and balance sheet must translate eventually, and possibly quite soon, into outsized growth of the money supply. This growth in the money\nsupply is inflationary if not reversed fairly soon. That's the argument.\nTo carry this argument a little further, the concern is that banks will begin to lend the large quantity of reserves that exist today, putting the money into circulation as the\neconomy picks up. The growth in spending that could result from this increase in money could push against the economy's capacity constraints in a way that creates\ninflationary pressures, according to the inflation pessimists.\nAltered role of bank reserves\nLet me draw attention to an important policy change that has altered the relationship between the quantity of bank reserves and overall spending in the economy.\nSince last October, the Federal Reserve has been paying banks interest on their reserve deposits. This shift means that banks are more likely to hold reserves with the Fed\nthan in the past and less inclined to look for a way to invest or lend excess reserves. Now banks earn on reserves where previously they didn't. So now there is less direct\n\n\flinkage between growth in the size of the Fed's balance sheet and inflationary pressures. In other words, the absolute size of the Fed's balance sheet isn't as scary as it was\nbefore.\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not saying that the current size of the balance sheet is necessarily the most appropriate. What I am saying is one should not assume at this point that\nextraordinary measures to shrink the balance sheet are required to contain inflationary pressures.\nIn addition, let me highlight two points from the minutes of the most recent FOMC meeting. First, the size of the balance sheet is currently expected to peak later in the year\nand then begin to decrease. This decrease will occur as various liquidity programs are phased out or decline in use and as long-term asset purchase programs are\ncompleted.\nSecond, the FOMC is actively studying mechanisms to deliberately shrink the size of the balance sheet should the need arise, and to do this without causing disruptions to\nthe economy. According to the minutes of the last FOMC meeting, a top Fed priority is “ensuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn smoothly and at the\nappropriate time.”\nIn my view, some inflation pessimists are not giving weight to the changed mechanics of monetary policy transmission to the broad economy. For some years now the Fed\nhas used interest rates—interest rate policy—to influence economic activity and inflation. Paying the banks interest on their reserves allows the Fed to tighten monetary\nconditions by resetting this floor interest rate without direct manipulation of the size of the balance sheet.\nNonetheless, it's important that we policymakers remember that rising inflation fears can evolve into inflation expectations on which businesspeople and consumers act.\nModern inflation fighting by policymakers is substantially about anchoring expectations. The bulwark against rising inflation expectations is the Fed's credibility. By this, I'm\nreferring to the belief that the monetary authorities have the tools—and the commitment—to act against inflation.\nI want to assure you the Fed has several tools and is readying itself to act on the balance sheet when the time comes. And I am very confident of the FOMC's commitment to\nprice stability. I recognize, however, it's easy to say one is committed to act in advance of the need to act. Circumstances at the time may make the need less clear and the\ndecision more complicated. So, if the incremental step of announcing a formal inflation target would serve to calm current fears and prove convincing on an ongoing basis, I\nwould favor such a move. I think that discussion needs to continue.\nLet me summarize my argument here today. The economy is stabilizing and recovery will begin in the second half. The recovery will be weak compared with historic\nrecoveries from recession. The recovery will be weak because the economy must make structural adjustments before the healthiest possible rate of growth can be achieved.\nWhile this adjustment process is going on in the medium term, I believe inflation and deflation are roughly equal risks and require careful monitoring. Slack in the economy\nwill suppress inflation. And inflation is unlikely to result—by direct causation—from the recent growth of the Fed's balance sheet. In any event, the Fed has a number of tools\nbeing readied to unwind the policies used to fight the recession, and it will be some time before their use is appropriate.\nI will end with those thoughts and would be happy to take your questions.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Press release • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\nRELATED LINKS ON OTHER SITES: Interest on reserves FAQ\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nNational Association of Securities Professionals\nAnnual Pension and Financial Services Conference\nAtlanta, Ga.\nJune 11, 2009\nIn recent weeks, sentiment about the U.S. economy has clearly improved. A modicum of optimism has returned.\nI'm as ready as you are for a real turn of the economy. For several weeks now we've been hearing of so-called \"green shoots\"—that is, little signs of\nlife in the economy that foretell a recovery. This imagery coincides with spring having sprung. It seems very human. Our spirits rise with the better\nweather, the warmer temperatures, the return of baseball, and we see encouraging signs all about us. As I said, I'm ready for recovery, but I've got\nto ask: Could we be kidding ourselves? Is it real?\nIn my remarks today, I'll respond to that question first by providing an up-to-date fix—as current as the data allow—on the economic situation. Then,\nI'll talk about the most serious risks I see in the economy along with my baseline outlook for a near-term recovery. I'll close with some views on the\ntension I perceive between short-term economic prospects—which are net positive—and longer-term structural challenges that, in my view, must be\nfaced with a sense of urgency.\nThe tug and pull between immediate prospects for the economy and over-the-horizon threats seem to me to be captured in the question of the moment: What's causing rising\nterm U.S. Treasury yields? And in what way, if at all, should policy react? Here I must repeat my usual disclaimer: The views that follow are mine alone and don't necessarily\nreflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nCurrent fix on the economy\nMy view of the current economy is mixed. For the most part, the economy is still in decline, but the pace of decline has clearly slowed. I'd like to make a distinction between\nstabilization and recovery, and I believe we're seeing signs of stabilization.\nAs regards stabilization, I'd like to highlight four areas: employment, housing, consumer spending, and manufacturing.\nEmployment: Unemployment insurance claims data, released this morning for the week ending June 6, reinforced a two-month trend in labor markets, and that is, layoffs are\ngradually decelerating. However, claims remain near record-high levels, and firms' reluctance to hire has lifted the most recent unemployment rate to 9.4 percent in May.\nHousing: Many of today's problems started with housing, and by most measures a clear recovery in the housing market has yet to emerge. My contacts here in the Southeast\nconfirm the most recent data on the national housing market, namely that house prices are still falling, but the rate of decline has moderated somewhat.\nImproved affordability combined with historically low mortgage rates and a new first-time homebuyers' tax credit have helped move a portion of the huge inventory of unsold\nhomes off the market. Preliminary results from the survey of homebuilders and Realtors in the Southeast conducted by the Atlanta Fed indicate more optimism that sales will\npick up in the future.\nConsumer spending: In data released this morning, the Census Bureau reported that retail sales were up 0.5 percent in May after posting declines in March and April. Some\nof the increase may be related to higher gasoline prices. And there were areas of spending weakness. Overall, last month's retail sales numbers were more positive than\nnegative. But compared with May of last year, sales are down a striking 9.7 percent. So sales are nudging higher but from very low levels.\nWith consumers holding back, the personal saving rate in April climbed to 5.7 percent, marking the first time savings exceeded 5 percent of disposable income in more than\n14 years.\nManufacturing: The industrial side of the economy has been especially hard hit this year, and the sector remains under considerable stress. But there are recent signs—such\nas the latest Institute for Supply Management purchasing managers survey—that the rate of manufacturing decline may be slowing too.\nFinancial markets\nAs so many have said, a return to economic growth depends on working financial markets, and there's been recent progress in several areas, including with banks, shortterm funding, corporate markets, and securitization markets.\nThe number of so-called problem banks is elevated and likely to keep climbing. However, there's been some better news from the banking industry. For instance, the\nSupervisory Capital Assessment Program, also known as stress tests, has provided us with a better handle on the capital buffer the largest banks would need to remain well\ncapitalized and able to lend if the economy performs worse than expected.\nFollowing up on the stress test results, the Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced that the 10 banks required to bolster their capital have submitted plans to meet\ntheir requirements. Then on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury announced that 10 of the largest institutions participating in the capital purchase program had met requirements to\nrepay the government for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds provided to them. I view these developments as signs that the banking system is healing, and\nrising confidence in the banking system is justified.\n\n\fMarkets for short-term funding also have improved, including the interbank lending markets and commercial paper markets. Spreads between the London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) and the overnight index swap rate have declined to levels that are close to precrisis levels.\nCorporate bond issuance has increased recently. Although U.S. Treasury rates have been on the rise, spreads between Treasury yields and rates paid by corporate\nborrowers have narrowed somewhat. Overall, the cost of capital for highly rated businesses has come down.\nFinally, as regards securitization markets, the asset-backed securities (ABS) market collapsed in 2008 but this year has begun to gradually revive with the aid of public\nprograms designed to jump-start the securitization markets.\nIssuance of new ABS, including credit card, auto and student loans, and equipment leases, has totaled more than $40 billion since the Fed launched the Term Asset-Backed\nSecurities Loan Facility (TALF) in March. This activity is still far short of the $200 billion annual ABS issuance before the financial crisis, but it represents a marked\nimprovement from last year. Furthermore, risk spreads on ABS have been declining steadily this year and should help ease the cost of credit for both households and\nbusinesses.\nWhile credit market functioning has improved, the picture I've just painted of our current economic environment is framed with caution. At this point, there's still a debate\nabout whether business activity has reached a bottom.\nEven when the recovery is well under way, I expect an extended period of sluggish growth. And the initial phase of the recovery may \"feel\" like a recession for many\nhouseholds and businesses.\nForecasts and risks\nIn the normal course of our work, the Atlanta Fed produces a forecast of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation. Like most forecasters, we see the economy\nbeginning to recover in the second half of this year.\nFor the medium and longer term, however, I expect growth will be relatively subdued for some time after it turns positive. My thinking is the economy has to go through\nstructural adjustments that could lower the trend rate of growth for the recovery's first couple of years at least.\nMoreover, I believe there are ongoing threats that pose downside risks to sustained recovery.\nAt the broadest level, global economic weakness constitutes a continuing risk. This recession knows no borders, and the downturn has become especially severe in Japan,\nEurope, and certain developing markets such as Eastern Europe. Though there are promising signs in some countries, the International Monetary Fund still projects global\ngrowth this year will be –1.3 percent, the most severe worldwide contraction since World War II.\nDomestically, commercial real estate is a problem for the economy and problematic for my outlook. My forecast takes into account worsening commercial real estate—office,\nretail, hotel, and warehouse, all of which are under stress. But since this is an emerging story, I don't think we should underestimate the scope of the problems of commercial\nreal estate and the potential disruption to a still stressed banking system.\nFinally, in an economy built for personal consumption, there is the risk consumer psychology and resulting consumption could turn negative. Consumer sentiment regarding\nthe economy has improved but remains very low by recovery standards and could reverse with adverse turns in the data or worsening market conditions.\nEven without such a reversal, several factors are likely to continue to hold back consumer spending. These include weak labor markets, pressures to repair household\nbalance sheets, and still tight credit conditions. Going forward, I doubt that the financial system will accommodate the degree of household leverage consumers enjoyed\nbefore mid-2007. So I'm expecting a period of adjustment.\nResolving long-term imbalances\nAs mentioned at the outset, U.S. Treasury rates have risen recently. As you know, Treasury yields influence a broader array of market rates, most importantly mortgage rates.\nThe recent rise in Treasury rates has brought sharper focus to the requirements of recovery, in terms of both policy and the real economy. And these requirements compete,\nto some extent, with the requirements of transition or, more precisely, rebalancing.\nThe rise of Treasury rates, or yields, has been characterized as both good and bad omens. Various interpretations have been put forward. To wit:\nThe rise of term Treasury rates reflects the improved outlook for real growth.\nThe rise of term Treasury rates signals declining risk aversion and the unwinding of the safe haven inflows that occurred last fall.\nThe rate rise demonstrates increased inflation expectations related to concerns of monetization of the burgeoning federal debt.\nThe rise is evidence of decreased demand on the part of foreign investors.\nThese and possibly other explanations may all be factors in the market. I'm sympathetic to the good omen explanations—that the rise is connected to the improved outlook—\nbut I don't rule out that there is something here to monitor very carefully. The steepening of the yield curve may reflect growing concern over the nation's ability to correct\nprofound structural imbalances; that is, to combine recovery with transition.\nAn immediate recovery that does not bring with it substantial progress in rebalancing the economy for the longer term will not be durable. And failure to effectively come to\ngrips with the requirements of rebalancing could result in unwanted inflation and chronic economic underperformance.\nThe rebalancing agenda has been widely expounded. Among rebalancing imperatives, the U.S. citizenry must rebalance consumption and savings. Connected to this, the\ncountry must rebalance consumption and investment. And above all, the worsening fiscal imbalance must be addressed.\nHigher nominal rates in the term Treasuries market can be seen as an expression of creeping doubt that the American polity, and more specifically the policy community, is\nup to the sacrifices, tradeoff decisions, and the courage of convictions the situation requires.\n\n\fThe concerns about our economic path are crystallized in doubts expressed in some quarters about the Federal Reserve's ability to fulfill its obligation to deliver low and\nstable inflation in the face of very large current and prospective federal deficits. In a word, the concerns are about monetization of the resulting federal debt.\nI do not dismiss these concerns out of hand. I also recognize that the task of pursuing the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and sustainable growth will be greatly\ncomplicated should deliberate and timely action to address our fiscal imbalances fail to materialize. But I have full confidence in the Federal Reserve's ability and resolve to\nmeet its inflation objectives in whatever environment presents itself. Of the many risks the U.S. and global economies still confront, I firmly believe the Fed losing sight of its\ninflation objectives is not among them.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nLevy Economics Institute at Bard College\nConference on the State of the U.S. and World Economies\nNew York\nApril 16, 2009\nYour conference theme—\"Meeting the Challenges of the Financial Crisis\"—provides wide latitude for a speaker to look back, look forward, and treat\nany number of topics. This afternoon, I plan to look ahead and consider certain challenges of the post–financial crisis period.\nIndeed, I believe it's a good time to start thinking about life on the other side of the financial crisis. Today, the economy is still very weak, but there\nare some encouraging signs that support cautious optimism.\nMy outlook calls for the beginning of a recovery in the second half of 2009. I do not expect a strong recovery, but I do expect the economic\ncontraction we're now experiencing to give way to slow and tentative growth as early as the third quarter.\nRisks remain to this cautiously optimistic outlook. I am concerned about the commercial real estate sector and how its performance could affect the\nbanking system, which I addressed in a recent speech. I am concerned that continuing job losses will reverse the slight indications of improving\nconsumer confidence. And I continue to watch house prices with concern. House prices continue to fall, as indicated by the Case-Shiller index. Along with these domestic\nrisks, global risks are also considered in my outlook given downward revisions in forecasts for gross domestic product growth in most major economies.\nNonetheless, I think this is an appropriate juncture to give more detailed and practical thought to the world we want to construct after this difficult period. In my remarks today,\nI plan to share my personal views (not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee) on a basic question about the postcrisis environment. It\nis: What regulatory environment will both align with the reality of financial markets and adequately address recent failings?\nI trust this topic is appropriate for a conference in honor of Hyman Minsky. As you know, he devoted much of his academic life to the forces that give rise to financial instability\nand the important role that institutional arrangements play in both the promotion of, and the remedy to, financial instability.\nFinancial markets and securitization\nThere has been much discussion about restoring a commercial bank–dominant financial system, downsizing large systemically critical financial institutions to eliminate the\n\"too big to fail\" problem, and limiting the role of securitization as part of a shrinking of the shadow banking system. These are examples of opinions that range from\npredictions to prescriptions on what the financial system will look like.\nThe financial system has already undergone what some would call radical change. I'm referring to the reduction of the number of stand-alone investment banks, the\nconversion of some investment banks to bank holding companies, and the forced consolidation of the commercial bank sector. I'm cautious about predicting such substantial\nchange going forward. I expect the financial system to continue to involve a mix of capital markets and institutions, but with a wider array of institutions falling under\nregulatory supervision. Furthermore, I take it as given that there will continue to be large international institutions with operations in many countries, that is to say, regulatory\njurisdictions around the globe.\nLooking ahead, I see an ongoing role for securitization and the originate-to-distribute model. Securitization markets have shrunk dramatically over the last year and a half and\nin some cases have shut down altogether. I expect these markets to return, perhaps in simpler form and with more accountability.\nI expect securitization to continue because this form of financial intermediation developed in response to needs and realities that have not disappeared. I was a commercial\nbanker in the 1980s and I remember well the onset of the practice of balance sheet allocation according to return on assets and ultimately return on equity. Commercial\nbanks were, and remain, caught in a dilemma of wanting to serve their clients by providing loans, but not always being able to justify booking very competitively priced loans\non their balance sheets.\nThis tension gave rise to various securitization, distribution, and asset liquidity strategies including off-balance-sheet vehicles, such as the now notorious structured\ninvestment vehicles. The excesses that arose need to be addressed, of course, but the underlying economics of 12-to-one leverage banking continue to dictate that assets\nretained on balance sheet meet net interest margin and return requirements. Banks must compete against all businesses for capital and seek competitive returns and\nearnings per share growth. In this respect, they do not compete only against other banks.\nSecuritization has brought benefits to consumers that cannot be easily matched by a bank that originates a loan to hold. In particular, mortgage securitization, which began in\nthe 1980s, has led to lower mortgage rates, advancing the social goal of homeownership by improving affordability. In more recent years, however, mortgage-backed\nsecurities have been engineered and resecuritized into increasingly complex structures known as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs and even CDOs squared.\nInvestors in these securities relied on credit rating agencies to assess risk, and banks took advantage of regulatory arbitrage to conduct this business off balance sheet. The\nresulting lack of transparency regarding the value of the securities and the financial condition of the banks holding them was a central factor in the financial turmoil of the last\n18 months.\nGoing forward, markets and investors will show a new awareness of the potential for complexity, opacity, and risk in securitized instruments. This awareness, in and of itself,\nhas and will continue to provide incentives for the creation of simpler and more transparent securitization structures. For these and other reasons, I expect our securitization\nsystem to be reformed but not replaced.\n\n\fAgile oversight required\nThe regulatory environment we construct in the coming months must be suited to a financial system that remains a mix of capital markets and institutions—formal and\nshadow banking—with an array of institutional operating models.\nAgainst this reality, a system that responds to the perceived faults of the precrisis financial world by imposing a set of rules about what behaviors are prohibited is almost\ncertain to amount to \"fighting the last war.\" I do not believe we can easily anticipate where the next source of stress in financial markets will arise.\nIn my view, the postcrisis environment will require agile oversight. This regulatory approach should stress actively managing risk as it evolves with the associated potential for\nan institution failing versus an approach that focuses on avoiding failure.\nFollowing this logic, the regulatory environment we construct should be a well-balanced mix of rules and principles guiding flexible response and should also give a\nmeaningful role to market discipline. In an ideal world, effective market discipline necessarily allows for failure in a system in which no institution is too big (or interconnected,\nor complex, or operationally critical) to fail. It will take some time to achieve this ideal situation.\nSeveral policy actions over the last year and a half have been about avoiding the failure of a large, systemically critical institution. It's important to emphasize that some of\nthese actions took place in the absence of resolution authority, that is, the authority of a regulator to manage the failure of an insolvent institution in a purposeful and orderly\nmanner.\nIn simple terms, resolution involves these steps: 1) seizing control of the entity, 2) finding an acquirer or acquirers, 3) selling off assets, 4) stabilizing funding arrangements,\nincluding insured depositors and counterparty exposures, 5) working out unsold assets, 6) allocating losses to shareholders, bondholders, wholesale depositors, and other\nclaimants, and 7) managing final liquidation and shutdown, if required.\nThough this list sounds relatively straightforward, aspects of it are extraordinarily complex. At the core of the systemic risk issue is the fact that banks and other highly\nleveraged financial institutions are involved in a complex network of two-way, short-term funding arrangements. The failure of a large interconnected financial institution\nthreatens the funding of its counterparties, which then threatens their counterparties, and so on.\nThe metaphor that seems apt is a chain of falling dominoes. Any robust resolution process must come to grips with the potential for these sorts of network spillovers and\ninclude mechanisms for short-circuiting the potential cascade of counterparty failures when a lead domino falls.\nIt seems to me that this type of resolution of a large, globally integrated and diversified financial institution is new territory for regulators and involves some challenges that\nhaven't been faced. Ideally the process would be substantially accomplished in a short period of time with as little expense to the taxpayer as possible. Some commentators\nhave suggested that \"a short period of time\" be defined as something along the lines of \"over a weekend.\" Given the required scope and degree of integration with multiple\nnational economies, that description of speed may be unrealistic.\nThe challenge (or problem) of resolution can be summarized as follows: The entity is not just a domestic financial institution, but a collection of many domestic institutions, all\nwith cross-border connections. These entities in aggregate involve hundreds or more legal vehicles, operating across a range of business lines that are not easily separable,\nin as many sovereign legal and regulatory structures, each interested in orderly resolution in its jurisdiction. Further, there may be (is likely to be) no single buyer that is\nqualified and acceptable to all. A resolution exercise of this magnitude has not been performed before.\nYet, without a believable resolution capability, the too-big-to-fail problem isn't reduced. The problem becomes \"too big (interconnected, complex, etc.) to resolve.\"\nThis challenge suggests resolution planning should be a continuous effort on the part of regulators. Practices might include \"what-if\" consultation with national authorities\nwhere the biggest offshore operations are located, resolution simulations to identify potential problems in advance, and working with institutions and host governments to\nachieve cleaner and simpler legal structures that are resolution-ready. By resolution-ready, I'm envisioning legal vehicle structures that wrap the assets and business units of\norganic businesses into entities that can be easily evaluated and transferred in the event of a necessary disposal.\nThese are just top-of-mind ideas. My point is I'm urging careful thought on the implementation and execution capabilities required to limit systemic risk. In assessing the\nproliferating opinions about regulatory reform and focus, we should ask, how would you operationalize it?\nThe financial crisis in this country has resulted in financial industry consolidation. The effect of industry consolidation is greater concentration without, as yet, much reduction\nof systemic risk. The preferable direction is the opposite—toward less concentration.\nIdeas have been floated, but there is not yet much consensus on how to accomplish deconcentration. Forced downsizing and breakup is an option. I have concerns about\nsuch an approach. It strikes me as a drastic measure that could unfairly penalize relatively healthy and successful institutions.\nAn alternative could be a scheme of escalating supervisory attention as a financial institution approaches and exceeds thresholds of systemic risk. This approach might\nprovide a check on institutions and be a disincentive to becoming a potential systemic problem.\nNo return to simpler times\nIn my remarks, I have tried to contribute—based on my experience as a banker turned policymaker—constructive thoughts for the architects of the postcrisis financial and\nregulatory world. Next month, the Atlanta Fed hosts a conference at Jekyll Island, Ga. The conference will take place where about a century ago many of the ideas leading to\nthe Federal Reserve System were deliberated. Those meetings were held in 1910 in the aftermath of a financial crisis that bears strong resemblance to our current\nexperience.\nComing off the turbulence of 2007 through 2009, I can appreciate the yearning for a simpler era. But the future financial architecture and the regulatory approach that lines up\nwith it must be constructed, in my view, to be durable, evolve with inevitable change, and be equal to the reality of the financial sector that will survive this period. I expect the\nfinancial system to retain its diverse elements including securitization markets, large globally integrated institutions, and vigorous innovation.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\n\fRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart's biography • Press release • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nGlobal Interdependence Center Conference on Food and Water: Basic Challenges to International Stability\nParis, France\nMarch 26, 2009\nIn the United States today there are growing social and political tensions between those who identify with the mainstream public—often called Main\nStreet—and the financial sector, often lumped together as Wall Street. Many of my country's citizens see their interests as disconnected from the\nbanks and financial markets.\nIn the past few months, I've delivered several speeches with the message that functioning credit markets are absolutely necessary for economic\nrecovery. With a global recession and ongoing and comprehensive interventions aimed at restoring financial stability, I believe it's important for\neveryone to understand the linkages between credit markets and the broader economy.\nYour theme of food and water stability offers me another way to make my point about the interconnection of credit and economic activity. In my\nremarks, I will offer my views as a central banker on how problems in credit markets have dampened global trade, including trade in that most\nelemental of traded goods—food.\nTrade and finance\nI'd like to begin with some background on trade and credit markets. The fall of trade barriers and the rise of market economies, especially those in Asia and Eastern Europe,\nhave driven rapid growth of international trade in recent decades. The value of merchandise trade in 2008 was about $16 trillion, according to the World Trade Organization.\nBy some estimates, merchandise trade rose from 16 percent in 1983 to 25 percent in 2008 as a percentage of gross global product.\nImportantly, about 90 percent of cross-border trade transactions involved some form of credit (as opposed to cash settlement). So functioning credit markets have been and\nremain crucial to the flow of goods and services around the world.\nTrade-related credit is now supplied primarily by banks using the instrument of the documentary letter of credit, whose purpose is to secure payment for the exporter. Letters\nof credit guarantee that an importer is able to pay and allow exporters to load cargo for shipments with the assurance of getting paid. Pre-export and post-shipment funded\ncredit is tied to the self-liquidating feature of letters of credit.\nA significant majority of trade finance is handled by private sector banks and is highly concentrated among a small number of lead institutions. Furthermore, there are\nanecdotal reports about the disappearance of the secondary market in trade credits and country exposure.\nExport credit agencies, which are often state run, tend to step up to play a countercyclical role by supporting export transactions when their domestic banks pull back. Export\ncredit agencies assume risks that private lenders are unwilling or unable to accept and handle a sizeable portion—although a minority—of global trade financing.\nThis financing infrastructure made possible decades of trade expansion that came to a sudden halt in the fourth quarter of 2008. Since that time, many countries have\nreported double-digit declines in trade in nominal value terms, with real physical volume also declining.\nEconomists expect trade to decline during an economic slowdown. But the recent sharp contraction of trade appears to be far more severe than would be expected given the\ndecline in global economic activity.\nI believe some of the fall in international trade can be attributed to the disruption of the interbank credit system. The marked reduction of interbank lending appetite has been\nassociated more with the market for short-term liquidity, but it also has affected trade credit. With the interbank liquidity crisis, banks have moved to reduce overall\ncounterparty exposure including trade credit.\nPricing also has been affected and adjusted upward based on perceptions of increased risk. According to the International Monetary Fund, more than 70 percent of banks\nsaid that charges for various types of letters of credit have risen in the past year. And the percentage is higher for trade-related secured lending facilities in which goods\ntraded serve as collateral. Trade credit remains available in many cases, but its higher cost means fewer transactions are getting done.\nThe recent sharp decline of commodity prices also has affected trade financing. Volatile commodity prices have undermined confidence in the value of commodity cargo.\nThere are reports of commodity goods piling up in the physical channels of trade because of trade finance closing down.\nTrade finance used to be less affected by macro financial instability. But since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, trade finance has become more sensitive to generalized\nliquidity squeezes.\nThe Asian crisis a decade ago was a defining moment in the evolution of trade finance. With the broad-based disinvestment from emerging markets during that period, the\nthreat of contagion among borrowers alarmed international lenders. Capital account instability played a significant role during this period—more than during prior episodes of\ninstability.\nIn 1998, at the peak of the financial crisis in Indonesia, international trade finance for imports emerged as a problem. In that case, international banks reportedly refused to\nconfirm letters of credit opened by local banks because of an overall loss of confidence in the banking system.\n\n\fSince this episode, trade credit has tended not to be distinguished from other forms of exposure by creditors and, as a result, is now treated as just another form of shortterm credit.\nThe global food chain and credit\nNow, let me add a few remarks about trade in food, which of course is a basic life necessity. According to the United Nations, food trade amounted to nearly $800 billion in\n2007, or close to 6 percent of global trade. As a significant component of overall trade, food trade is also affected by problems with trade credit. Contraction of international\ntrade in food commodities is a serious concern.\nFood represents from 10 to 20 percent of consumer spending in industrialized nations, but as much as 60 to 80 percent in developing economies. Many emerging countries\ndepend on imports for a significant share of their food supply. As a result, some of these countries are highly vulnerable to contraction in food trade credit.\nMy home country has a major interest in this issue. The United States is one of the world's major exporters of food commodities. In the fourth quarter of last year, U.S. food\nexports fell 23 percent quarter over quarter.\nBeyond food exports, U.S. economic growth early last year was supported by overall exports, which held up until the sudden collapse in the fourth quarter. In my economic\noutlook for the remainder of 2009, I do not expect a sudden return of exports as a driver of recovery in the United States.\nAn obvious conclusion is the world is interconnected not just by the flow of physical trade but also through the flow of trade credit.\nSteps to address financial issues\nIn the public square of the United States, the tension over government actions to stabilize the banking and financial system has intensified in recent weeks. Much of the\nreaction to certain developments is understandable but, in my view, draws attention away from what must be the fixed focus of policy—to return the banking and financial\nsystem to health.\nFurthermore, the framing of the problem has been, perhaps naturally, mostly domestic. As a consequence, consideration of damage to the global trading system has taken a\nback seat for the most part.\nMy purpose today has been to bring attention to this dimension of the financial and economic crisis that besets us and to reemphasize the centrality of stabilizing banking\nsystems. Banks are a vital element of the international trading system.\nMany actions have been taken to stabilize the U.S. financial system, and further very important measures are in train. For instance, the removal of legacy \"toxic\" assets from\nbank balance sheets is an essential step. The Treasury's plan announced Monday should address this issue. I believe the capital adequacy assessment program, which\nsome have called stress tests, will establish a baseline of consistency with regard to balance sheet weakness and capital needs going forward. Finally, I welcome\nadjustments to fair value treatment of assets trading in illiquid markets that the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued for comment last week.\nThe subject matter of this conference—food stability—serves to elevate the priority of restoring full functioning of the trade finance system through continuing efforts to fix our\nvarious national banking systems. Food stability—or its inverse, food instability—tends to grab our attention and bring needed focus on what must be done.\nInternational trade has lifted millions of people out of poverty. But that progress is at risk. The weakened fundamentals of banks and the resulting diminished availability and\nhigher cost of credit have become weak links in the chain of global trade. By restoring functioning credit markets, I believe these weaknesses can be repaired.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart's biography • World Trade Organization • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nOn Real Estate and Other Risks to the Economic Outlook\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nGreater Miami Chamber of Commerce\nMiami, Florida\nMarch 4, 2009\nThanks for inviting me to be your speaker for the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce Trustee Luncheon. I appreciate this chance to speak to the\nbusiness leadership here in your city.\nAlready this year I have given several speeches on the economy, and in my earlier remarks to other groups I provided a picture of a U.S. economy\nthat was very weak but in a position to begin a modest recovery during the second half of the year.\nAlso, in these speeches I talked about a number of risks to this outlook. In my remarks today, I will elaborate on two of those risks, specifically\nresidential and, especially, commercial real estate.\nI believe this focus should interest you since real estate is a very important contributor to south Florida's economy and, for that matter, to the\nSoutheast region overall. Problems in residential real estate are well known. But with continued economic weakness I'm increasingly paying\nattention to commercial real estate.\nDeclining commercial real estate markets could put further pressure on already strained financial institutions and markets. And overcoming problems in the financial sector is\ncentral to achieving economic recovery.\nAs a policymaker, I feel the need to ground my views in a sober, unvarnished assessment of reality. But I do want to leave you with a sense that the Fed is ready and able to\nrespond decisively to emergent problems in the economy and that the Fed's actions are buttressed by other public policy programs and vice versa. Let me lay the foundation\nfor this discussion with a summary of the state of the U.S. economy and my near-term outlook.\nI must state up front that these remarks are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe economy\nLooking broadly at the national economy, the recent numbers have been discouraging. Just last Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis announced gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) contracted by 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008—worse than the 3.8 percent decline shown in the preliminary numbers.\nOther incoming data give little reason to be upbeat about the immediate future. Unemployment continues to rise. Unemployment insurance claims have been high—worse\nthan generally expected. Consumer spending has declined sharply since last fall, especially spending on durable goods such as autos. Businesses have scaled back\ninvestment spending.\nIn the housing sector, January home sales reports—both new and existing—were well off December levels. Housing starts have fallen from a peak rate approaching 2 million\nto an annual run rate below 500,000. The pullback in new construction is probably a necessary evil to bring down elevated house inventories.\nAmid this sharp drop-off in economic activity, I take some comfort in signs of improvement in strained credit markets, particularly where policymakers have provided support.\nInterbank lending risk spreads have fallen in recent months, and residential mortgage rates have reached levels low enough to encourage refinancing and purchases by\ncreditworthy borrowers. Commercial paper spreads over short-term Treasury bills have declined, and investment-grade corporate bond spreads have remained generally flat\nfor some months. Investment-grade corporate bond issuance has been healthy of late.\nNotwithstanding some improvement, it's fair to say credit markets remain stressed.\nAll that said, I have been predicting an upturn in the overall economy beginning in the second half of 2009, with a slow and gradual return to our full economic potential. To\ntemper that outlook a bit, uncertainty remains unusually high, and one has to be mindful of very real downside risks, including a further deterioration in real estate.\nResidential real estate\nAs you know, residential real estate was the catalyst of problems in credit markets. Problems in housing contributed to economic weakness, but now the slowing economy is\nfeeding back into the continued housing slowdown. South Florida has been among the hardest-hit residential markets, so let me spend a few moments discussing housing.\nAt the current pace of sales, the nation's supply of new homes is more than 13 months—the highest on record. Sales of new single-family homes fell 10 percent in January,\nand existing homes fell more than 5 percent.\nHome prices here in Miami—after a steep run-up during the housing boom—have fallen 41 percent from a peak in December 2006. Nationally, house prices in 20 major\nMSAs have fallen almost 27 percent since their peak in the second quarter of 2006, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index.\nOther measures show smaller declines nationally. There's no doubt, though, that declining house prices have been a major driver of mortgage delinquencies, defaults, and\nforeclosures. What's happening is a profound revaluation of mortgage portfolios as well as securities in the global secondary market for mortgage-backed securities.\n\n1\n\n\fEfforts to prevent foreclosures appear to have had only modest success so far.1 There are many reasons this might be the case, but among them is the obstacle posed by\nsecuritization agreements to loan modifications. To date, payment-reducing modifications have been the exception rather than the rule. As a result, redefault rates have been\nhigh, and new foreclosures continue to add downward pressure on housing prices.\nI should also comment on the weakening multifamily residential real estate picture. No two rental markets are exactly alike. But to generalize, those markets trending the\nworst probably share one or more characteristics. They had excessive condo construction or condo conversion activity. Such markets are seeing unsold units return as\nrentals. They had very high home price appreciation in the years 2004—07 with large amounts of speculative house construction activity. Today, in several markets, houses\ncompete with apartments as rentals. And they have been experiencing high and rising foreclosure rates.2\nCommercial real estate\nWhile historically smaller than residential real estate, commercial real estate (or nonresidential structures) accounts for a not-insignificant portion of the American economy—\nat least 4 percent of GDP directly and perhaps more, depending on estimates. Also, commercial real estate is important to the financial sector. And a rejuvenated financial\nsector is essential for economic recovery.\nThere are currently some $2.5 trillion of commercial property loans on the balance sheets of financial institutions and in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)\nmarkets. In contrast, residential mortgage debt amounts to about $11 trillion.3\nSome 25 percent of commercial real estate debt is securitized, compared with 60 percent of outstanding home mortgage debt. The volume of CMBS has more than doubled\nsince 2003, a bit faster than the growth of overall commercial real estate debt.\nThere are several subsectors of commercial real estate: retail, office, hotel, and industrial. All are facing problems.\nThere is a growing imbalance of retail space for several reasons. A lot of new retail space was added in areas that saw a high level of home construction, much of which has\nnot been absorbed.\nThis imbalance is aggravated by general weakness in the retail industry. Established retail centers are seeing rising vacancy rates. When an anchor tenant leaves a shopping\ncenter, or overall occupancy falls below a threshold level, other tenants are often free to cancel their leases. Industry data indicate that abandoned retail store expansions\nand store closings have reached levels not seen since the recession and real estate slump of 1991–92.4\nThe hotel subsector is facing excess supply in the face of soft demand. Occupancy rates declined about 8 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2008, according to\nindustry sources.5 Summer tourism was hurt by high gas prices, and now business travel is declining as companies scale back in a weak economy.\nAlso, with the decline in the economy and rising unemployment, office and industrial vacancies have been rising. In virtually all segments of commercial real estate, there is\ndownward pressure on property values because of new construction coming on stream—construction started before the recession fully set in—coupled with the effects of the\neconomic downturn.\nInterestingly, the only property type currently withstanding downward pressures is warehouse. This seems to be, perversely, at least partly because of the back-up of\ninventories resulting from weak consumer spending and adverse retail and manufacturing conditions.\nFinancing pressures\nGiven eroding demand for commercial space, financing pressures in commercial real estate are cause for concern. Vacancy, property value, and financing are connected, of\ncourse.\nBanks are a primary source of construction financing for commercial properties. Various financing models have evolved. The largest construction loans on \"trophy\nproperties,\" for example, are typically syndicated among very large banks with equity provided by institutional investors. When construction is completed and the property's\noperating cash flow has stabilized, the loan is placed with an investment fund, with an institutional investor, or in the CMBS market.\nFor other large properties, banks lend for the construction of new projects or to refinance existing loans and then look to the CMBS market to provide the longer-term funding.\nFor smaller properties, many regional and community banks do not use the CMBS market on a regular basis, often keeping the mortgages on their books.\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts estimates that about $400 billion of commercial mortgages are set to mature this year, raising concern about\nmaturity defaults.\nCommercial real estate finance challenges could further complicate efforts to stabilize the banking system and credit markets. Banks that financed the construction of\ncommercial properties may end up keeping those loans if the properties cannot achieve the cash flow needed to service new permanent debt. Loans maturing face a CMBS\nmarket that virtually shut down in the latter part of 2008 and a banking industry that is already saddled with bad assets from the residential sector.\nPublic policy response\nAs a Fed policymaker, I must consider whether we have tools in place to soften the impact of emerging weaknesses.\nThe Fed has a number of tools at our disposal and has been using them aggressively.\nWith the emergence of financial turmoil, starting in the latter half of 2007, and weakening growth, the FOMC aggressively lowered the short-term policy interest rate—the\nfederal funds rate—from 5.25 percent in September 2007 to a range just above zero today. The federal funds rate is the foundation rate of the whole spectrum of private\nmarket rates of varying tenors and loan purposes. By influencing the yield curve, the fed funds rate acts to stimulate general economic activity.\nThe Fed also introduced a number of targeted credit facilities aimed at easing liquidity pressures faced by financial institutions and restoring the functioning of key capital\nmarkets. Examples include facilities for commercial paper and money market mutual funds.\n\n\fRecently, the Fed has begun directly purchasing assets in securities markets. The Fed has authorized the purchase of up $100 billion of debt of federal housing finance\nagencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and another $500 billion of agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. To date, about $195 billion has been expended\nin this program. The provision of such liquidity has served to lower yield spreads on these securities, which ultimately can translate into lower mortgage rates for consumers.\nWith continued illiquidity in securitization markets, the Federal Reserve—in cooperation with the U.S. Treasury—recently announced that it is prepared to expand its\nforthcoming Term Asset-Backed Securities Liquidity Facility (TALF) from $200 billion to up to $1 trillion. This program was originally designed to support consumer and small\nbusiness finance through lending on securities backed by small business loans, student loans, auto loans, and credit cards. An announcement yesterday also said that the\nFed and Treasury are looking into accepting CMBS and other types of AAA-rated, newly issued ABS.\nI also want to mention measures taken to stem preventable foreclosures. Here in south Florida, for example, our staff created and co-chairs a homeownership preservation\ntask force of nearly 80 organizations to promote dialogue between lenders and foreclosure counselors. Since foreclosure prevention is not always possible, we are also\nproviding data and analysis to local municipalities as they prepare to purchase, rehabilitate, and sell properties to help protect neighborhood integrity.\nNear term and long term\nIt's fair to ask: Will these efforts be effective? There are no guarantees, but I take comfort from several aspects of the public policy response. First, policymakers have acted\nforcefully to address the economic and financial sector crises.\nAs mentioned earlier, Fed interventions have had success in credit markets where we've introduced specific facilities to address acute market stress. I look forward to the day\nthese programs are no longer necessary, but they can be kept in place as conditions require.\nSecond, other public policy organizations have also acted. For instance, the U.S. Treasury Department has announced a multipronged financial stability plan, which includes\nmeasures to strengthen the capital position of banks, remove bad assets from bank balance sheets, and other actions. And the new administration has recently released its\ncomprehensive Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan that is designed to lower actual payments for many homeowners. In addition, Congress recently passed a large\neconomic stimulus package with measures intended to stop net job destruction and kick-start job creation.\nWith regard to the longer run, it will be important to take a very careful look at what went wrong during this period. Many observers have expressed doubts about the\nsecuritization process. They have pointed to incentive conflicts within the originate-to-distribute model of financial intermediation, along with concerns about the ability of\nlenders and the rating agencies to properly measure risk.\nIn my view securitization markets need reform but in the end will be a substantial part of the nation's total credit system. Securitization has provided cost benefits to\nconsumers and other borrowers and liquidity to loan originators, including commercial banks. It's essential that securitization markets get brought back to life.\nOne more thought in closing: Public policy and the resilience of our citizens are being tested. With respect to public policy, I want to assure you that the Fed has the capacity\nto act, even with the federal funds rate near zero, with the aim of returning the country as quickly as possible to its enormous potential for growth and prosperity.\n\nFootnotes\n1.

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThoughts on Risk in the Current Economic Situation\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAssociation for Financial Professionals Corporate Risk Forum\nOrlando, Florida\nFebruary 23, 2009\nThanks for inviting me. It's a privilege to be your luncheon speaker for the Association for Financial Professionals Corporate Risk Forum.\nI approached this speech by thinking about what I could offer an audience of risk management professionals from diverse industries in these times\nof risk being all too real. Your businesses and clients share at some level a common macro environment even if the implications of macro risk might\nplay differently from industry to industry and company to company. Today I want to discuss the state of the economy and the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Atlanta's forecast, or outlook, for the economy this year. That sort of speech is pretty standard for a Reserve Bank president. To make the\n\"relevance connection\" to your field of risk management, you may take my remarks on the macroeconomy as one policymaker's views on the\ncontext in which you evaluate the risks specific to your company's or client's situation.\nRecently the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) enhanced the transparency of our policy deliberations by disclosing the central tendency of\nformal quarterly forecasts of each Reserve Bank. I will also provide my perspective on the macroeconomic forecasting process employed by the\nAtlanta Fed and comment on how you might consider the usefulness of such forecast information in your evaluation of macro risk.\nI must state up front that these remarks are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC.\nThe state of the economy\nA little more than a year ago, the economy entered into a recession. If the consensus economic forecast is accurate, we are likely to still be in recession through at least the\nfirst half of this year. Since the end of World War II, the United States has experienced 10 other recessions. On average, they have lasted 10 months. So the current\ndownturn is already longer than usual.\nI know that as risk management practitioners, you track the economy at whatever aggregation—regional, national, global—is most relevant to your business. Let me highlight\nfor you some of the national economic indicators I'm following as a monetary policymaker.\nFirst, there's housing—the source of much of the current economic weakness. New residential construction has fallen by more than half in the past 20 months, taking about\none full percentage point off annual GDP growth.\nTroubles with housing have taken a heavy toll on consumer spending. Purchases of big-ticket items that require a large financial commitment and access to credit—notably\nautos—have been especially curtailed.\nAlso, business spending has fallen sharply. Investment spending has been deferred and cost control intensified.\nLabor markets have been shedding jobs rapidly in manufacturing and services. During the past 12 months our economy has lost a net of 3.5 million jobs, with about half of\nthose job losses in the past three months.\nIf there has been a silver lining in the economic slowdown, it's prices. Inflation in recent months has declined to the point where consumer prices in January 2009 were\nunchanged from a year earlier—the lowest rate of change since August 1955.\nThe outlook\nIt's obvious to all that the current state of the economy is extremely weak. The more pertinent question is, what does the future hold?\nThe economic forecast I submitted for the most recent FOMC meeting at the end of January reflected my view that the economy faces obstacles likely to work against a\nstrong rebound of growth over the next several quarters. Those obstacles include credit markets not yet returned to healthy functioning, a housing market still weighed down\nby an excess supply of homes for sale, and low business and household confidence. None of these is likely to turn around quickly.\nBut as discouraging as these indicators are for the very immediate future, most forecasts, my own included, see catalysts for the start of modest recovery in the second half\nof the year.\nWith production falling—and expected to decline significantly more this quarter—I expect some reduction of excess inventories, putting producers in a position to expand\noutput as spending returns.\nThere are signs lower mortgage interest rates are helping housing markets on the margin. The January pending sales number was up, and there has been a spurt in\nrefinancing activity. If historically low mortgage rates can be sustained over the coming months, I expect more buyers will be drawn into the market.\nSeveral factors should lift consumer spending as the year progresses. These factors include the dramatic fall in energy prices, greater stability in the housing market, and\nimproving consumer confidence. Also, as you know, the tax cuts in the recent stimulus package were designed to generate an immediate boost to consumer spending.\n\n\fForecasts as an exercise in risk management\nThe premise of that baseline forecast is founded, as you would expect, on assumptions that may or may not materialize. My forecast of resumption of modest growth in the\nsecond half assumes, to repeat, some stabilization of house prices, some normalization of credit markets' functioning, some benefit from the stimulus package, and some\nimprovement of business and consumer confidence evidenced by greater investment spending and personal consumption. A Reserve Bank's official forecast also has as its\npremise \"appropriate monetary policy.\" That is to say, whatever scenario we adopt as our baseline forecast is not independent of policy, but rather vitally entwined with Fed\npolicy as a significant influence on outcomes.\nThis aspect of our forecasting is a little different than macro environmental assumptions relevant to individual enterprises. Companies can establish assumptions for the\nexternal environment and then derive implications for the business and strategies to respond to external reality. Public policy bodies like the Fed have meaningful influence\non the macro environment to varying degrees over time.\nPolicy is a major factor in our forecasts and not a reaction to a forecast. To convey a sense of what \"appropriate monetary policy\" might mean for the near term, I would point\nto the statement that followed the January 28 FOMC meeting. The committee stated that \"economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal\nfunds rate for some time.\" The committee further advised that all available tools will be employed to get back to economic growth, which means, in my interpretation, further\ncredit programs such as the purchase of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities or expansion of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which was\nrecently announced as part of the Treasury's Financial Stability Plan.\nI should also explain that my baseline forecast is a scenario around which we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta carry out a process of \"dynamic monitoring.\" The\nstream of incoming data is analyzed for implications for the assumptions underlying our forecast, which in turn is revised as required by the unfolding of reality—weekly,\nmonthly, and quarterly.\nEconomic forecasts—particularly when looked at collectively—provide valuable information for risk managers in their underlying assumptions and their information about the\ndegree of uncertainty in the economic environment. I would argue they are less useful as point predictions of data elements or timing of turning points.\nAmong the lessons I've taken from my two years of experience as a central banker is how difficult it is to see the transition to a nonlinear future, which you might think of as\nthe change from one phase of the business cycle to another. Forces that produce the beginnings and ends of recessions are particularly difficult to predict. Turning points are\nanomalous events and by their very nature are more difficult to see than variations around a more or less linear scenario, by which I mean continuity from past to present.\nAs a consequence, economic forecasts will tend to be overly optimistic as the economy goes into a recession but overly pessimistic as the economy comes out of recession\nand begins its expansion. Perhaps we should take some comfort in that observation today.\nI think there are some other lessons to take away from the experience of the last two years. Tail risks—low probability but extremely consequential events—do sometimes\nmaterialize. Ignoring tail risks—\"black swans,\" in the words of author Nassim Taleb—may be irresponsible. Because forecasting is an inexact exercise, because shocks by\nnature aren't anticipated, and because both theoretical models and econometric models cannot incorporate actual complexity, policy must sometimes take what we call a\n\"risk management\" approach. Policymakers occasionally need to take out insurance against economic tail risks, and this approach is especially relevant when traditional\nrelationships have broken down. Case in point: Our models are based on a history where financial markets are working.\nComprehensive policy response\nLet me give you my appraisal of current policy.\nResponding to the scope and severity of our economic ills, policymakers have taken and will soon implement unprecedented measures to restore financial stability and\neconomic growth. In my view, the diagnosis is substantially correct, and the actions targeted on discrete aspects of the overall problem, taken together, constitute an\nappropriately comprehensive approach. Let me bring focus to five dimensions of the current problem and connect them to the associated policy actions.\nFirst, there is credit market dysfunction. The Fed has attacked this problem by introducing a number of credit market liquidity programs. For example, the TALF supports new\nlending in credit cards, student loans, auto loans, and small businesses. This program could provide up to $1 trillion and should help repair securitization markets and boost\ncredit to broad categories of consumers and small and midsized businesses.\nJump-starting securitization markets is vitally important. Securitization markets are and will be a substantial part of the nation's total credit system.\nAnother problem is banking system weakness. I believe that by injecting capital into banks, the U.S. Treasury has strengthened and will further strengthen bank balance\nsheets. Under Treasury's new plan, the government also will create a mechanism to remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets, which should help rehabilitate the\nbanking system, a basic prerequisite of recovery.\nA third dimension of today's weakness is falling house prices. The FOMC has stated that the Fed will continue to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities to support mortgage and housing markets, and the Fed stands ready to expand the quantity and duration of such purchases. Also, a foreclosure prevention\nprogram is included in the Treasury's new plan. If successful, a source of pressure on home prices should be reduced.\nThe Administration's economic stimulus package is designed to address the recent surge of unemployment, which is a fourth aspect of economic weakness. Rapid\ndownstreaming of funding to state and local governments should help forestall further layoffs and furloughing of public sector employees. Public works and other investment\nprojects should put some of the unemployed back to work, depending on the speed of mobilization.\nFinally, there is the broad-based economic weakness that has enveloped almost all industry sectors with a deficit of confidence as both cause and effect. We are in a period\nof unconventional policy measures, and that situation is especially true of the Federal Reserve. But the stimulative power of conventional monetary policy in the form of a\nfederal funds rate at its lowest possible level should not be forgotten. As I said earlier, the FOMC has stated that low interest rate policy is likely to continue for some time.\nI believe these actions—taken as a whole—are a forceful and coherent response to the problems at hand. In judging coherence, I apply these criteria:\nIs the problem correctly diagnosed?\nIs the response to each dimension of the problem sufficiently sized?\n\n\fIs the response timely?\nAnd, is the specific policy reversible when required or appropriate?\nThere is policy risk, to be sure, by which I mean risk that the policy medicine won't work, won't be enough, or will come too late. But if forecasts of improvement don't\nmaterialize, as I said earlier, the Fed is not without capacity to act, even with the fed funds rate at its lower bound.\nOther risks\nA sober mindset dictates that I, as a policymaker, watch for indications of both recovery and further deterioration. Beyond policy risk, the banking system, and housing, there\nare other downside risks that bear watching, in my view.\nFirst, there's the commercial real estate sector. Vacancy rates are rising, and in 2009 a considerable amount of debt comes due and must be refinanced.\nSecond, I'm following the state and municipal fiscal situation. Revenues have fallen sharply and debt financing is constrained. Even with the stimulus money, some\ngovernment entities may continue to face serious fiscal problems.\nInternationally, I'm watching the external debt position of emerging markets and the effect of sovereign debt exposure on overseas banks, particularly in Europe.\nI'm also paying close attention to the trajectory of Japan. Last quarter the Japanese economy contracted by 13 percent, and deflationary pressures have accelerated.\nFinally, I'm concerned about growing global protectionist sentiment. The Great Depression taught that beggar-thy-neighbor policies can do immense harm.\nComprehensive, scaled, and coherent responses\nIn my view, we have reached a pivotal juncture.\nAfter a rapid onset of problems in the economy and financial system—both global and national—we've reached a point where incremental responses must proceed to\nsomething more comprehensive, scaled, and coherent.\nI believe the composite policy approach is correct in focus and intent, and now the devil is largely in the details and implementation. I am confident policymakers across the\nvarious relevant arms of government understand the importance of moving ahead as quickly as possible to provide detailed rules of the road and achieve clarity.\nAs these policy actions take effect and work in concert, I believe the economy and financial sector will respond positively. Thank you.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nBirmingham Regional Chamber of Commerce\nBirmingham, Alabama\nFebruary 19, 2009\nThanks for inviting me. It's a privilege to be your afternoon speaker for the Birmingham Regional Chamber of Commerce's 2009 Business Outlook\nConference.\nEarlier today, you heard about the local economy and some industries important in this region. This afternoon, I'd like to speak more broadly about\nthe U.S. economic situation and outlook. I know that times are rough right now, but I believe policies in place and about to be implemented will work\nto restore financial stability and economic growth for the long term. During my remarks, I will describe some of the signposts I'm looking for on the\nroad to economic recovery.\nI want to state up front that these remarks are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\nThe state of the economy\nA little more than a year ago, the economy entered into a recession. By all available indicators, we remain in recession today. And if the consensus economic forecast is\naccurate, we are likely to still be in recession through at least the first half of this year.\nSince the end of World War II, we've experienced 10 other recessions. On average, they have lasted 10 months. So the current downturn is already longer than usual.\nLast fall, the pace of business and consumer spending dropped off sharply and the labor market started shedding jobs at a much faster pace than what we had seen over the\nfirst three quarters of the year. So at a time when historical experience suggests the economy should have begun to crawl out of the downturn, the recession instead began\nto pick up momentum.\nLet me describe to you in somewhat broad terms the buildup to today and the current economic picture.\nThe problems originated in the housing market and spread to other sectors as mortgage-related losses damaged bank (and other financial institutions') balance sheets.\nCounterparty risk aversion first brought liquidity pressures. After a stream of writeoffs, these liquidity pressures progressed to doubts about solvency.\nAn array of key financial markets—particularly securitization markets—became illiquid. Access to credit through security markets or banks tightened severely. Business and\nconsumer confidence was shaken.\nAs you know, housing has been particularly hard hit. Existing sales have fallen about 35 percent from peak levels in September 2005, and the inventory of unsold homes has\nsoared and remained at high levels. As a consequence, home prices have fallen 20 to 25 percent nationally—even more in certain areas.\nThe direct impact of housing on the economy has been substantial. New residential construction has fallen by more than half in the past 20 months, taking about one full\npercentage point off annual GDP growth. Housing starts today stand below 500,000 annualized. Business models and capacity in the home building and building materials\nindustries were designed for starts at a rate approaching two million.\nYet while housing may have triggered the recession, the downturn—particularly since last September—has gone well beyond residential construction.\nConsumers have sharply pulled back spending. Declining home and equity values, worsening income prospects because of a deteriorating labor market, and a general\nunease about the economy have strained finances in many households.\nPurchases of big-ticket items that require a large financial commitment and access to credit—notably autos—have been especially curtailed. But virtually every component of\nconsumer spending has dropped in dollar value by deferral, substitution, or outright elimination from household expenditures.\nLed by a decline in motor vehicle and parts production, manufacturing output fell by 2.5 percent in January—the third consecutive steep monthly decline.\nAt the end of last year, exports and business investment spending became the latest casualties of this cycle of wealth and income destruction. As business conditions around\nthe world began to worsen, previously robust export markets dried up. Last quarter, U.S. real exports fell for the first time in five and a half years.\nAt the same time, the uncertain sales outlook and credit difficulties pushed capital spending sharply lower—down a bit more than 19 percent at an annual rate in the fourth\nquarter—its biggest quarterly retreat in 34 years.\nThe cascading drop in business activity I just described has taken a toll on the U.S. labor market. During the past 12 months our economy has lost a net of 3.5 million jobs,\nwith about half of those losses in the past three months. Even the recession-resilient services sector has lost more than 1.7 million jobs since December 2007.\nThe rate of joblessness has jumped a full percentage point since October to 7.6 percent. The share of unemployment attributable to layoffs, the share of people who are\nworking part-time because of a weak economy, and the proportion of people who have dropped out of the labor force in discouragement have all risen sharply in the past few\n\n\fmonths.\nThe outlook\nIt's obvious to all that the current state of the economy is extremely weak.\nThe national economic indicators I have described are evidenced daily in your order books, human resource reports, and income statements. I suspect there is little in these\nnumbers that you don't already know from your direct experience. What is likely \"top of mind\" for most of you, I am sure, is the question \"When does this dreary story end?\"\nThe economic forecast I submitted for the most recent FOMC meeting reflected my view that the economy faces obstacles that are likely to work against a strong rebound of\ngrowth over the next several quarters. Those obstacles include credit markets not yet returned to healthy functioning, a housing market still weighed down by an excess\nsupply of homes for sale, and low business and household confidence. None of these is likely to turn around quickly.\nBut as discouraging as these indicators are for the very immediate future, the economic outlook is not indefinitely bad. Most forecasts, my own included, see catalysts for the\nstart of modest recovery in the second half of the year.\nWith production falling—and expected to decline significantly more this quarter—I expect some reduction of excess business inventories, putting producers in a position to\nexpand output as spending returns.\nThere are signs lower mortgage interest rates are helping housing markets on the margin. The January pending sales number was up, and there has been a spurt in\nrefinancing activity. If historically low mortgage rates can be sustained over the coming months, I expect more buyers will be drawn into the market.\nSeveral factors should lift consumer spending as the year progresses. These factors include the dramatic fall in energy prices, greater stability in the housing market, and\nimproving consumer confidence.\nI should mention that last week the U.S. Census Bureau reported an unexpected increase in retail sales during January. I would like to see further confirmation of the\nunderlying strength hinted at in this report, but on its face, the pickup in consumer spending is encouraging.\nAlso contributing to the upturn seen in the consensus outlook are the large and targeted fiscal, credit, and monetary policies of the government and the Federal Reserve—a\ntopic I will return to in a moment. The intent of these aggressive and unprecedented policy actions is to support spending and fix the dysfunction in credit markets that has so\nseverely constrained the economy's natural forces of growth.\nIndeed, we have seen modest, but hopeful, signs that financial markets are improving. A key element in the improved economic environment expected in the latter half of the\nyear is that financial institutions will find more stable footing and begin to provide greater support to business expansion and consumer spending.\nComprehensive policy response\nAn important consideration in the outlook is the policy effect. Responding to the scope and severity of our economic ills, policymakers have taken and will soon implement\nunprecedented measures to restore financial stability and economic growth. In my view, the diagnosis is substantially correct and the actions targeted on discrete aspects of\nthe overall problem constitute an appropriately comprehensive approach. Let me bring focus to five aspects of the current problem and connect them to the associated policy\nactions.\nFirst, there's credit market dysfunction. The Fed has attacked this problem by introducing a number of credit market liquidity programs. For example, the Term Asset-Backed\nSecurities Loan Facility (TALF) supports new lending in credit cards, student loans, auto loans, and small businesses. This program could provide up to $1 trillion and should\nhelp repair securitization markets and boost credit to broad categories of consumers and small and mid-sized businesses.\nJump-starting securitization markets is vitally important. Securitization markets are and will be a substantial part of the nation's total credit system.\nAnother problem is banking system weakness. By injecting capital into banks, I believe the U.S. Treasury has strengthened and will further strengthen bank balance sheets.\nUnder Treasury's new plan, the government also will create a mechanism to in effect remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets, which should help rehabilitate the\nbanking system, a sine qua non of recovery.\nA third dimension of today's weakness is falling house prices. The FOMC has stated that the Fed will continue to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities to support mortgage and housing markets, and the Fed stands ready to expand the quantity and duration of such purchases. Also, a foreclosure prevention\nprogram is included in the Treasury's new plan. If successful, a source of pressure on home prices should be reduced.\nThe Administration's economic stimulus package is designed to address the recent surge of unemployment, which is a fourth aspect of economic weakness. Rapid\ndownstreaming of funding to state and local governments should help forestall further layoffs and furloughing of public sector employees. Public works and other investment\nprojects should put some of the unemployed back to work, depending on the speed of mobilization.\nFinally, there is the broad-based economic weakness that has enveloped almost all industry sectors with a deficit of confidence as both cause and effect. We are in a period\nof unconventional policy measures, and that is especially true of the Federal Reserve. But the stimulative power of conventional monetary policy in the form of a federal funds\nrate at its lowest possible level should not be forgotten. The FOMC has stated that low interest rate policy is likely to continue for some time.\nI believe these actions—taken as a whole—are not only strategic as argued above but also a coherent response to the problems at hand. In judging coherence, I apply these\ncriteria:\nIs the problem correctly diagnosed?\nIs the response to each dimension of the problem sufficiently sized?\nIs the response timely?\nAnd, is the specific policy reversible when required or appropriate?\n\n\fThere is policy risk, to be sure, by which I mean risk that the policy medicine won't work, won't be enough, or will come too late. But if forecasts of improvement don't\nmaterialize, the Fed is not without capacity to act, even with the fed funds rate at its lower bound.\nA sober mindset dictates that I, as a policymaker, watch for signposts of both recovery and further deterioration. On my watchlist through 2009 is the commercial real estate\nsector. For instance, I am following the risk of defaults related to refinancing demands of existing properties and project development loans coming up for long-term financing.\nI also will be watching the financial conditions of emerging markets as well as growing protectionist sentiment in this country.\nSignposts on the road to recovery\nAs I look ahead, signposts on the road to recovery include sustained normalization in credit markets and stabilization of house prices. Also, I'm watching for an uptick in\nbusiness spending to give a sign of a return of opportunity seeking and private sector risk taking needed to sustain growth.\nI draw hope that the signposts will be biased to the upside from my conversations with businesspeople like yourselves. Increasingly, I'm hearing that this current set of\ncircumstances presents very interesting opportunities for individual businesses. When stronger companies act on those opportunities, an important element of recovery will\nbegin.\nWe have reached a pivotal juncture. After a rapid onset of problems in the economy and financial system—both global and national—we've reached a point where\nincremental responses must proceed to something more comprehensive, scaled, and coherent.\nI believe the composite policy approach is correct in focus and intent, and now the devil is largely in the details and implementation. I am confident policymakers across the\nvarious relevant arms of government understand the importance of moving ahead as quickly as possible to provide detailed rules of the road.\nAs these policy actions take effect and work in concert, I'm confident the economy and financial sector will respond positively. Thank you.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Press release • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nNew Monetary Policy and the Economic Outlook\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRotary Club of Atlanta\nAtlanta, Georgia\nJanuary 12, 2009\nWithout question, last year was extraordinary. Developments included the failure of storied investment banks and the introduction of an arsenal of economic policy tools and\nresponses.\nEntering 2009—having been back in the South now for almost two years—I added one more tool to a list that includes rate cuts, special liquidity\nfacilities, rescue funds, deposit guarantees, and interventions to save institutions whose failure would pose risk to the global system. Following an\nold tradition, I had a plate of black-eyed peas on New Year's Day for good luck. I figured, \"Well, it can't hurt.\"\nAs a policymaker on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I want to organize my thinking by revisiting basic questions. I will structure my\nremarks today around two such questions. They are, first, what is Fed policy trying to accomplish in these extraordinary times? Second, how is the\nFed going about accomplishing those policy objectives?\nThe context here really matters. The principal instrument by which the Fed influences the economy is the federal funds rate (the overnight rate at\nwhich banks lend and borrow central bank reserves). The fed funds rate can't go any lower. As you know, at the FOMC meeting December 16, the\nfederal funds rate target was lowered to a range of 0–25 basis points. A year ago, when I last spoke to you, the fed funds rate target was at 425\nbasis points (or 4.25 percent).\nIn terms economists use, the policy rate has reached its zero lower bound. This situation has raised concerns that the Fed can't do any more to combat recession and that\nmonetary policy—broadly defined—has lost relevance at a crucial point in time. I would argue that a federal funds rate this low will have considerable macroeconomic effect\nespecially if accompanied by policies to improve the functioning of credit markets.\nTraditionally, these January talks by the Atlanta Fed president at the Atlanta Rotary have concentrated on the economic outlook. I will talk a bit today about the outlook, but I\nplan to depart somewhat from tradition to explain the new monetary policy regime that I expect will be employed for the foreseeable future—while the fed funds rate can't go\nany lower. My intent is to assure you the Federal Reserve has not exhausted its policy tools. The policy arsenal available to the Federal Reserve remains a powerful\ncorrective force on the economy.\nAs usual, I offer the disclaimer that all my remarks are my personal views and don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC.\nThe state of the economy\nI'll begin with some economic highlights of the year we have just put behind us. We now know that the U.S. economy was in a recession that began in December 2007, and\nthis recession could end up as one of the longest since World War II.\nFriday's employment report reinforced both the depth and breadth of the downturn. Nonfarm payrolls tumbled an estimated 524,000 in December as the unemployment rate\nhit 7.2 percent—a 16-year high. The economy lost around 2.6 million jobs for the year. Moreover, the job losses are very broad-based across industries, with only\ngovernment, private education, and healthcare adding jobs in December.\nThe depth of the downturn is reflected in the dramatic decline in consumer spending in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, led by a collapse of auto sales. Motor vehicle\nsales were some 36 percent below year-earlier levels in December.\nJust a few months ago, inflation was at very high levels following a steep run-up in commodity and fuel costs. However, commodity prices, most notably oil prices, have fallen\nsharply in recent months, evidencing a marked pullback in global growth. This, combined with a fall-off of broad domestic activity, has led to a substantial slowing of inflation.\nAs much as anything, we'll probably remember 2008 for extreme volatility and dysfunction in financial markets, particularly credit capital markets serving businesses and\nhouseholds. Volumes of credit flows fell off dramatically, risk spreads widened, and some markets virtually shut down. We've seen improvement since the worst period in\nSeptember and October, but, all in all, financial conditions going into 2009 are still unsettled.\nToday, as we move into 2009, economic conditions are extremely weak and financial markets remain impaired. In the banking sector, a posture of risk aversion—or at least\ncaution—persists.\nWhat's the Fed trying to accomplish?\nKeeping these circumstances in mind, let me address the first question I posed at the outset. That is, what's the Fed trying to accomplish?\nIn simple terms, we're focused on containing the impact of the economic downturn and stimulating a recovery as early as possible. The Fed is not alone in this effort. The\nTreasury Department and other federal agencies have also implemented policies to support economic growth, and the incoming administration has proposed a large fiscal\nstimulus package for the economy.\nThe Fed, as the country's central bank, conducts monetary policy—as distinct from fiscal policy—under legal mandates set down by Congress. The Fed's mandated policy\nobjectives—the so-called dual mandate—are sustainable economic growth along with low and stable inflation.\n\n\fThe mandates have not changed. But what has changed is some aspects of how we pursue those objectives. Extraordinary circumstances this last year and a half have\nrequired the Fed to expand the set of tools employed to meet those objectives.\nNew monetary policy\nModern conventional monetary policy is usually thought of as the Fed's adjustment of the federal funds rate target in the overnight market for bank reserves. Bank reserves\nare a liability on the central bank's balance sheet. The fed funds rate is important because it influences the whole term structure of interest rates. The lowering of the funds\nrate target some 525 basis points since September 2007 can be seen as a direct response to worsening economic conditions and the resulting downward revisions to the\noutlook.\nThe federal funds rate is a very general tool and one that relies on the functioning of credit markets to have its intended effects. But, as you know, credit markets have not\nbeen functioning normally even in markets strongly backed by the U.S. government, such as agency (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) mortgage-backed securities. In\nturn, mortgage markets and housing demand have suffered.\nProblems that began in the subprime mortgage-backed securities market spread rapidly and often ferociously among interconnected markets and institutions. It's not too\nmuch an exaggeration to say no one and no market remained untouched. In response to events, the Fed had to be creative.\nInitially, as the Fed responded to credit market strains, the focus was on interbank markets. But, as problems spread, the Fed introduced almost a dozen targeted credit and\nfinancial market facilities. The facilities now include short-term credit programs for financial institutions, longer-term lending arrangements, direct asset purchases, and swap\nlines with foreign central banks. The Fed has intervened, for example, in the commercial paper market, the agency market, and the private asset-backed securities market.\nPrograms have supported banks, nonbank financial institutions, money market mutual funds, and, as you know, specific institutions deemed to be systemically critical.\nAmong the programs in force is the direct purchase of agency (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) notes and mortgage-backed securities. These securities are directly linked to\nmortgage rates. Purchases began just a few days ago. The goal of such a program is not, in my view, to engineer a particular interest rate level, that is, to hit a particular rate\ntarget. But direct purchases can promote directionally lower rates, help restore normal market functioning, and thereby achieve a return to reliance on private sector marketbased credit allocation.\nThe introduction of targeted asset-side measures has been aimed squarely at the breakdown of credit markets, the circulatory system of our modern economy. In my view, a\nprecondition of economic recovery is the return of the normal functioning of credit markets.\nLet me emphasize that this asset-focused approach is a departure from what the textbooks describe as conventional monetary policy and is not without controversy. Some\nhave called it credit policy to distinguish it from the conventional approach where the central bank achieves its objectives through its influence on bank reserves on the\nliability side of the balance sheet.\nI don't often use slides in speeches, but I want to show you this image because it so clearly illustrates this new approach and, I believe, helps to answer the second question I\nposed at the outset. And that is, how will the Fed go about accomplishing the policy objectives I described earlier by using the asset side of its balance sheet?\nAs the graph shows, there are two aspects of this policy approach—growth of the Fed's balance sheet in absolute terms and change of the composition of assets. Even with\nthe federal funds rate effectively at zero, there is ample scope to do more of both if conditions require.\nMeasuring policy actions\nIs it working? Well, isolating the effects unique to the Fed's policy actions on these various markets is difficult. Nonetheless, financial market functioning has shown some\nsigns of improving in recent weeks.\nBy way of example, in the short-term interbank funding markets, which are of central importance, spreads have declined markedly across maturities.\nConditions in commercial paper markets also have improved. Commercial paper issuance has increased from recent lows, and spreads on 30-day, asset-backed commercial\npaper, for instance, have narrowed.\nIn addition, mortgage rates have fallen recently in response to the Fed's announcement that it will purchase large quantities of mortgage-backed securities and agency debt.\nFreddie Mac's most recent mortgage market survey showed the average 30-year fixed rate has declined to just over 5 percent—the lowest since the series began in 1972.\nIt's impossible to measure what economists call a counterfactual—what might otherwise have happened. But without a willingness to use all available tools and to adapt\npolicy tools as conditions required, I'm convinced the economy's performance and current outlook would have been considerably worse.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead, the overall economy is very weak, and I expect it will remain weak at least through the first half of 2009. The incoming data suggest fourth quarter GDP\ncontracted somewhere between 4 and 6 percent (annualized). And this quarter's performance could be similar. At some point—perhaps later this year—I believe financial\nmarkets will have stabilized sufficiently to support a recovery. So I am looking for an improving economy in the second half. To temper that a bit, there is always the risk of a\nshock or reversal in the financial sector or elsewhere that could again alter the outlook to the downside.\nClearly, the U.S. economy is in a tough fight against pernicious economic forces. But, on balance, confidence is warranted. Indeed, restored confidence is an essential\ningredient in the mix of factors that will change the momentum of the economy. To buttress confidence, I want to assure you the Federal Reserve still has considerable\nammunition in reserve to be used as needed.\nBy this time next year, I'm hopeful circumstances will look very much better than they do today. I must admit that I don't really like black-eyed peas, so I'm hoping I can take a\npass on that dish next New Year's Day.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\n\fRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Federal Reserve assets illustration • Press release •\nSpeaker's Bureau\nRELATED LINKS ON OTHER SITES: Dec. 16, 2008 FOMC Meeting Statement • Factors Affecting Reserve Balances\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nU.S. Association of Energy Economics Annual Meeting\nNew Orleans, La.\nDecember 4, 2008\nDelivered in place of Richard Fisher, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who was unable to speak because of an illness.\nToday, I plan to offer remarks on current economic conditions with some brief comments on building a recovery. Let me offer the disclaimer that my\nremarks are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the thoughts of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Afterwards, I\nwill be glad to engage in dialogue with you and try to answer any of your questions.\nCurrent conditions—economy and financial markets\nEarlier this week, we learned the economy is officially in recession and has been since December 2007, according to the National Bureau of\nEconomic Research. Already, we know that this recession has been longer than the past two recessions. At present we're in the midst of a long and\npainful adjustment process.\nLet me discuss the major components of the economic downturn. Employment is weak. We'll get a better picture tomorrow [Friday, Dec. 5] with the\nrelease of November data. Commercial forecasters project a decline of another 300,000–350,000 jobs for last month.\nThese job losses would be in addition to an employment decline of 1.2 million for the first 10 months of the year. More than half of that job loss occurred between August and\nOctober, so the rate of job decline has accelerated. The most recent unemployment rate is 6.5 percent—the highest since 1994.\nThe U.S. industrial sector is sharply contracting. The ISM Manufacturing Index continued its steep decline in November, reaching its lowest point since the 1982 recession.\nAlso, purchasing managers report a sharp falloff in costs for commodities such as fuels and chemicals. The prices paid measure, after a sharp run-up earlier this year, is at\nthe lowest level in almost 60 years.\nConsumer spending this year has declined sharply. Though retail sales for \"Black Friday,\" the day after Thanksgiving, were better than expected, the National Retail\nFederation projects holiday sales will rise about 2 percent this year—the smallest increase since 2002.\nThe housing decline has continued with negative consequences on overall economic growth. Housing sales are soft, inventories are high, and prices are falling.\nThe United States is not alone in economic weakness. And just a few months ago the picture was entirely different with strong global demand, along with a weakening dollar,\nsupporting solid growth in U.S. exports. In recent years, some assumed that U.S. economic strength or weakness had become decoupled from growth in developing nations.\nBut a recent slowdown in global growth calls into question that decoupling theory. Now, there's very little evidence to support the view that a severe economic cold in the\nUnited States would not infect the rest of the world.\nEconomic outlook\nGiven this picture of a pretty dramatic worldwide economic slowdown, let me briefly describe the Atlanta Fed's near-term outlook, which is not encouraging. Employment is\nexpected to weaken further. Also, house prices likely will continue to fall with a further erosion of household wealth. Personal consumption likely will decline—at least for the\nnext few months.\nWith a worsening recession in the United States, the rest of the world probably won't do so well, either. The International Monetary Fund now projects that for 2009 economic\ngrowth in advanced economies will contract for the first time since World War II. Growth for emerging economies also is expected to slow to about 5 percent.\nOne positive bit of news is that falling commodity prices and increasing economic slack have eased global inflation pressure.\nWith regard to the U.S. economy, I expect very weak growth for much of 2009.\nI hasten to add, however, that economic forecasts always involve substantial uncertainty. The elements interacting today include the complex and volatile behavior of\nfinancial markets globally, compounding weakness in the real economies of interdependent countries and regions, the political transition in this country, and the ever-present\nthreat of noneconomic shocks from weather and geological events to pandemics to geopolitical crises.\nThis litany is intended to emphasize the challenge of economic forecasting.\nAs I evaluate options as a monetary policymaker, I believe the obvious questions when considering plausible scenarios are how deep will the recession be and how long it\nwill last? If consensus forecasts are correct, we are experiencing the worst of this episode now and into early next year. It is difficult in these circumstances to hold any\nforecast with great conviction, but I do believe that process of adjustment necessary to recovery is ongoing.\nPolicy resources and elements of recovery\nI think it's possible to isolate elements of the current circumstances that require resolution as a recovery develops. I hesitate to call them sine qua non prerequisites rather as\nprimary contributors. They are 1) housing sector and house price stabilization, 2) a return of consumer confidence, and 3) credit confidence.\n\n\fA direct path to recovery is unlikely, and, as we have seen, events arise that potentially threaten to knock us off the path to a more stable economic environment. Here I am\nthinking, of course, of the credit markets events of last spring and, especially, the last couple of months. In each of these cases, the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury,\nCongress, and other organizations stepped in to unfreeze frozen markets and limit, to the extent possible, damage to the broader economy.\nWhat else can the Fed do? In my view, the Fed retains a number of options to help ease the economy through this difficult transition.\nFor instance, the Fed has the ability to influence the economy by adjusting the fed funds rate, which has been lowered to 1 percent. It is true that we are limited in this\napproach by the fact that the funds rate cannot fall below zero. But as Chairman Bernanke indicated in a speech a few days ago, there are many other mechanisms that the\nFOMC can use to provide liquidity beyond targeting overnight interest rates.\nBeyond that, the Fed also has the ability to provide liquidity through various facilities, which have been expanded significantly in recent months. Also, the Fed has the ability\nto work with other central banks, and that process of international coordination of policy actions is continuing.\nThe recession has advanced to the point that it's well beyond the housing sector, where many of the problems started. The process of working through today's problems is\nongoing. It has been painful, and the spillover of financial turmoil has been broad based.\nNotably, that spillover has involved periodic and acute problems in credit markets. The Fed and other authorities have stepped in as appropriate to help address issues and\nhave worked to dampen the effects of these problems along the way. I am fully confident that we have both the means and the will to continue to do so as events require.\nClosing\nThe country faces very challenging circumstances. There is little to be encouraged about in current data. The near-term outlook does not, in my view, offer material relief. If\ncurrent forecasts bracket reality, this quarter and the next one or two are likely as bad as it will get. Policymakers have policy tools remaining to respond to unwelcome\nsurprises. And the intrinsic resilience of the economy at its core combined with the regenerative capacity of the financial system will carry us through.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Atlanta Fed Speeches • Dennis Lockhart’s biography\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nJoint conference hosted by\nthe Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, the Economic Council of Palm Beach County, and Palm Beach County, Florida\nNovember 7, 2008\nThe country is suffering from a severe financial crisis that has contributed significantly to an accelerating economic downturn. What started as a\nhousing sector problem became a generalized financial and credit market problem that spilled into the general economy.\nToday, I want to provide a good fix on where we are—the current status of the economy and financial markets—and then take stock of what\npolicymakers have done to date in response to developments. Finally, I'll comment on near-term recovery prospects for financial markets and the\neconomy and share some personal thoughts on what's needed for durable recovery over the long term.\nI must emphasize that the views you'll hear are mine alone and not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nStatus of the economy\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve pursues a dual mandate—economic growth consistent with maximum sustainable employment and price stability.\nRecent data indicate that the national economy is in recession. Economic activity as measured by real gross domestic product (GDP) declined an estimated 0.3 percent at an\nannualized rate in the third quarter, according to the advance estimate. Data for October suggest an even steeper decline in GDP for the fourth quarter.\nRecent downbeat readings follow fairly strong GDP growth in the first part of the year. Those results were buoyed primarily by exports and the temporary impact of the\nfederal tax rebate on consumer spending.\nGDP data earlier this year probably masked underlying weakness. I say this because employment has declined in every month this year. In recent weeks, business\nreluctance to hire has shifted into a marked increase in layoffs. The most recent reading of unemployment was released this morning and came in at 6.5 percent—up from\n4.9 percent in January 2008 and the highest in 14 years. In 2008, nearly 1.2 million jobs have been lost.\nContraction of the nation's housing sector has also continued to weigh heavily on the overall economy this year, and this has been especially apparent in parts of Florida,\nsuch as the Palm Beach area. A spike in foreclosures has added to the supply of homes for sale in the area and accelerated price declines. The problem is particularly\nevident in the local condo market, where construction continues to outpace demand. West Palm Beach ranks among the top 10 cities in the United States for condo\ncompletions, with thousands of units still under construction.\nThe U.S. economy in September and October appeared to weaken dramatically. Forces of contraction took hold in consumer spending, business investment, industrial\nproduction, and foreign demand for U.S.-made goods. Problems are now broad based. Beyond the housing sector, activity has fallen in auto manufacturing, transportation\nand distribution, retail trade, financial services, and some segments of commercial real estate.\nAnd without question, the dramatic events of September and October in the global financial markets contributed to an extremely cautious posture on the part of consumers\nand businesses.\nTo illustrate the relevance to Florida, the tourism industry reflects the erosion of economic confidence. At a tourism industry meeting organized by the Atlanta Fed last week in\nMiami, it was noted that during the first eight months of this year tourism attendance was steady—although revenue per visitor declined. But starting in September\nattendance collapsed, with tour operators, hoteliers, restaurants, and other businesses noting a sharp drop-off in activity.\nAs a result of the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy, inflationary pressures appear to be declining. In particular, sharply lower energy and other commodity prices\nhave contributed to lower headline inflation measures, and businesses appear to be more hesitant to pass on cost increases. The headline personal consumption\nexpenditure (PCE) price index in September eased on a year-over-year basis for the second consecutive month, to 4.2 percent.\nEconomic outlook\nAll in all, the near-term economic outlook is not encouraging. The incoming data in September and October have been worse than expected, and these results pushed my\nstaff and me to revise downward the Atlanta Fed's outlook for the economy.\nI foresee substantial weakness at least through the first half of 2009. This weakness will exacerbate the employment picture. In my outlook, unemployment will rise some\nmore.\nIf there is anything positive in this near-term outlook, it is the trajectory of prices. I expect headline inflation to decline over the coming months and fall into an acceptable\nrange below 2 percent by 2010. Over the longer term, inflation experience is influenced by inflation expectations. Encouragingly, the University of Michigan consumer\nsurvey's reading for October shows a moderation in inflation expectations both for the year ahead and for the longer term.\nEarlier, I mentioned the positive effect of exports on overall economic performance in the first half of the year. Could exports save us? Here too the picture is not encouraging.\nEconomic weakness has spread in recent months to engulf much of the developed and emerging world, including key trading partners in Europe and Asia. This, together with\nthe recent increase in the dollar, should push down exports.\n\n\fThe front-and-center question about the path of the economy is how deep and how long. Economic forecasts always involve substantial uncertainty. The elements interacting\ntoday include the complex and volatile behavior of financial markets globally, compounding weakness in the real economies of interdependent countries and regions, the\npolitical transition in this country, and the ever-present threat of noneconomic shocks from weather and geological events to pandemics to geopolitical crises.\nThis litany is intended to emphasize the challenge of economic forecasting. Prudence dictates consideration of alternative scenarios that, taken together, capture a range of\noutcomes. For instance, there are plausible upside scenarios anticipating rapid stabilization of financial markets and a quick snapback of the economy. And there are, of\ncourse, scenarios estimating a deeper and more protracted period of economic distress, and I believe these have to be taken seriously.\nThe term \"risk,\" as used in financial and economic discourse, means a quantifiable deviation from expectations. So—contrary to popular understanding—you can have\nupside risks along with downside. In our consideration at the Atlanta Fed of paths for the economy and its components, we commonly make a judgment on the balance of\nrisks around our baseline outlook and include it in the mix of things influencing my policy recommendation. On balance, I must give greater weight to downside risks at this\njuncture.\nI don't want to suggest a truly dark, doomsday-like scenario. Such storylines get much airing in times of stress but ignore the self-correcting nature of financial markets as\nwell as the arsenal of policy tools available.\nStatus of the financial crisis\nThe intense correction in the housing sector—clearly evident here in Palm Beach—has undermined confidence in the broader financial sector that has, in turn, fed economic\nweakness and further housing decline. This adverse feedback loop is very real. This dynamic has exposed the highly reticulated reality of our modern financial economy that\nhelps explain the surprising spread of what was widely thought to be a disturbance limited to the U.S. housing sector.\nHere is my sense of the status of the financial crisis: The dysfunction is centered in the credit markets including interbank, mortgage, corporate and business, municipal, and\ncommercial real estate. To varying degrees, these markets remain quite strained. Also, equity markets have expressed pessimism about the effect of constricted credit flows\non the broad economy and about the obvious weakness of incoming economic data.\nIn many credit markets liquidity remains tight, maturities remain short, new issuance remains subdued, and pricing remains wide relative to precrisis levels. Fears of\ncounterparty insolvency remain widespread in the interbank funding markets. September and October saw a flight to safety as evidenced by demand for Treasury securities,\nfor example. There have been signs of improvement lately, but concerns persist that this is a false dawn, and more trouble could lie ahead.\nSmaller businesses don't access credit markets directly; rather, they borrow from banks. About 75 percent of domestic banks last month reported tighter lending standards for\nloans to smaller firms, according to the Fed's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. That rate is up from 65 percent in the July survey.\nWhat's been done\nAs financial troubles have gathered over the last few months and the systemic scope and scale of the situation have become evident, an impressive array of creative\nmeasures have been employed to forestall further deterioration. These measures can be organized under the rubrics of monetary versus fiscal, liquidity versus solvency, and\ndomestic versus international.\nThe federal funds rate target has been lowered by a total of 425 basis points since August 2007. On October 29, the FOMC dropped the target fed funds rate by 50 basis\npoints to 1 percent—the lowest level since 2004. This cut followed a drop of 50 basis points on October 8. Also, earlier this year, the Fed lowered the premium for discount\nwindow borrowing.\nIn my view, these decisions were forceful responses to deterioration of the overall economy and the continuing dysfunction and volatility of the financial system. Now is not a\ntime to be tentative.\nThe Fed has also undertaken several liquidity-enhancing measures over the past year, including six special-purpose facilities known by their initials: TAF, PDCF, TSLF, AMLF,\nCPFF, and MMIFF. To encourage resumption of interbank and wholesale lending, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) has temporarily guaranteed most short-term\ndeposits.\nThe fiscal authority—the U.S. Treasury, with Congress approving—put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. In addition, the Treasury Department is now\nimplementing the TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) approved under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. A key feature of the TARP is the injection of capital into\nthe banking system, a program aimed at preserving solvency. This follows implementation of a fiscal stimulus package earlier this year.\nUnder the heading \"international,\" the Fed has put in place dollar swap facilities with a number of central banks. These facilities provide U.S. dollars to the monetary\nauthorities of countries whose commercial banks require dollar-based liquidity support. And on October 8, as already mentioned, the Fed participated in a coordinated action\nof rate cuts along with five other central banks. Much has been done.\nI expect these cumulative measures will help create the conditions needed for financial markets to stabilize and find a new normal. What's got to happen? Two things: First,\nU.S. house prices need to stop falling, and the volume of defaults and foreclosures needs to stop rising. These factors should help stabilize troubled asset values. Second,\ndeleveraging of the financial sector must run its course. Deleveraging continues—both voluntary and forced (forced by regulatory ratios, fund redemptions, and tougher\nlending terms between financial counterparties). Progress on these fronts should enhance clarity regarding the condition of counterparties in transactions internal to the\nfinancial sector and lead to a general return of confidence. Restoration of confidence is essential.\nRecovery will certainly come, and there are hopeful signs these last few days in the credit markets that the process has begun.\nWith sustained improvement of term funding and other indicators of credit market health, my rather sober and downbeat short-term economic outlook proceeds to an\neventual recovery of growth near potential with inflation returning to an acceptable range.\nBuilding a long-term, durable recovery\nLet me close with some thoughts for the long term. In some respects, the current financial crisis and economic fallout can be seen as a painful adjustment made necessary\n\n\fby macro imbalances that are global in nature. Symptoms in this country of such imbalances have included a highly leveraged financial system, a savings shortfall in the\nhousehold sector, and growing public sector deficits.\nIn my view, a mere cyclical recovery that returns to the status quo ante will not be durable. The shape of that recovery must witness coming to grips with deep structural\nimbalances in our economic arrangements if we are to lower the potential for a recurrence of instability. Ideally, the return of confidence and the better conditions this will\nbring should be accompanied by progress or even resolution of these imbalances as part of a durable recovery for the long term.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Podcasts • Press release • Atlanta Fed Speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nAtlanta's Fate in the Current Financial Crisis\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nBuckhead Rotary Club\nAtlanta, Ga.\nOctober 20, 2008\nIn July of last year, the rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded certain classes of residential mortgage-backed securities. This event\nprecipitated what was then described as a generalized repricing of risk in the financial system. What followed over the next 13 months was a\ncascading sequence of worsening conditions and dramatic events that culminated in this September's volley of market developments and policy\nreactions.\nDevelopments in September included\nthe placement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship,\nthe acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America,\nthe failure of Lehman Brothers,\nan $85 billion emergency loan to AIG,\nthe sale of WaMu (Washington Mutual) assets to JPMorgan Chase,\nthe drama around Wachovia that ultimately resulted in acquisition by Wells Fargo,\nthe conversion of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to bank holding company status, and\nthe U.S. Treasury Department proposal of a $700 billion rescue plan for the banking system. As you know, the Treasury's TARP (Troubled Asset\nRelief Program), which is part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act passed by Congress earlier in October, is being implemented.\nThe situation has been fast-moving and complex. To make sense of it we can identify four dimensions. First, there is the institutional dimension, the micro level of individual\nfirms—the stress endured by individual banks and companies as they cope with developments in the markets. Second, there is the credit system dimension—the dysfunction\nof the economy's circulatory system as evidenced by constricted short-term funding markets, bond issuance, and flows of bank credit. Third, there is the investment capital\nmarkets dimension. In recent days the world has been fixated on gut-wrenching declines in equity markets. And fourth, there is the general economy dimension—the\nspillover effect of financial turmoil and constrained credit on the nonfinancial economy.\nBy any measure, September was historic. The events of September contributed substantially to a fundamental restructuring of this country's financial system. It also brought\na transition from an incremental approach, including the Federal Reserve's various measures to provide much-needed liquidity to markets, to a comprehensive attack on the\ndiverse elements of the crisis. In October, the global scope of the problem was acknowledged, and the forceful implementation of globally coordinated action was undertaken\nby most major central banks.\nThis forceful response by the Treasury, Congress, the Federal Reserve, and collaborating governments distinguishes today's crisis from past financial crises like those\nleading to the Great Depression and the \"lost decade\" of the 1990s in Japan. In these prior episodes, policy responses were neither timely nor strong enough to avert longlasting problems.\nRoot causes\nBooks are already being written to chronicle the root causes of this crisis. By now, many of you are familiar with the story line, but let me lay it out again. Following the 2000–\n01 recession, chronic global savings imbalances made dollar surpluses a worldwide phenomenon. Interest rates were low for an extended period. These low interest rates\ncombined with active capital markets, freely flowing capital, financial innovation, and a generally optimistic growth outlook encouraged leverage and, in retrospect, the\nunderpricing of risk.\nAlso, low rates set off pursuit of incremental yield. This need was filled by mortgage-backed securities, more specifically subprime RMBSs (residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities), among other assets. All manner of business practices grew from these conditions that now seem quite problematic, at least for some borrowers and investors.\nFor example, adjustable-rate subprime mortgages and complex CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) and CDO squared.\nEasy mortgage terms helped fuel the demand for housing in the United States, which contributed to a 47 percent rise in the median existing house price between 2001 and\n2006. In retrospect, this was clearly a bubble, a bubble pricked by the downgradings in July of last year.\nFinancial institutions worldwide were caught holding large inventories of residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs on and off their balance sheets. Much that was off\nbalance sheet came back on. The value of these assets fell significantly in an environment of light or nonexistent trading. The holders of this paper came under increasing\nsuspicion as regards their liquidity and, in some cases, solvency. Wholesale funding became increasingly difficult to roll over. Widespread and massive deleveraging ensued\nand continues.\nThese developments exposed the intricate, interactive, and interdependent connections among institutions, between institutions and markets, and among markets, all global\nin scope. As I said, the situation is complex, and measures to deal with it have been controversial.\nOne line of criticism and opposition to recent measures to address the financial crisis has pitted Main Street against the financial industry, referred to as Wall Street. This\nadversarial perspective is understandable but is in no one's interest as the basis of policy responses to the crisis. Main Street and Wall Street intersect in every city and town,\nevery day. Let me explain how Wall Street and Peachtree Street intersect here in Atlanta.\n\n\fAtlanta situation\nHousing markets have been at the root of today's financial turmoil, and Atlanta's experience is instructive. Each major housing market has its own dynamic. Atlanta did not\nexperience the extreme price bubble seen in some areas; instead, pressures here manifested themselves in overbuilding.\nA number of factors drove Atlanta's housing supply run-up. One factor is the lack of natural barriers that limit building. In recent decades, Atlanta has expanded dramatically\n(some would use the word \"sprawled\") because of an abundance of low-cost land available for residential development. The result was a single-family new home market that\nwas the strongest in the nation in 2005 with 61,000 single-family housing permits issued in the Atlanta area.\nWhen sales began to slow in 2006, inventories climbed higher. Inventories of single-family homes are now at more than a year's supply at the current pace of sales,\naccording to some sources. With the excess supply of houses, the Atlanta area has been experiencing sharper declines in permits than the nation as a whole.\nBoth Atlanta and the nation saw permits peak in the fourth quarter of 2005, but Atlanta has experienced an 81 percent decline since that time, compared with a 61 percent\ndecline for the nation as a whole.\nForeclosed properties coming on the market have aggravated the inventory situation. Georgia's nonjudicial foreclosure process turns quickly, contributing to a spike in bankowned real estate inventories over the last year.\nAs I said earlier, house price appreciation was more moderate in the Atlanta area than the nation as a whole. Existing home prices in the Atlanta region have fallen more than\n8 percent—a not insubstantial number—from their peak in July 2007, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index of September 30. Existing home prices in major metropolitan\nstatistical areas (MSAs) across the country peaked in July 2006 and since that time have declined almost 20 percent.\nIn addition to housing, commercial real estate has been a vital part of Atlanta's economy. Amid the housing woes, Atlanta's industrial and commercial vacancy rate held\nsteady through the first quarter of this year but has been drifting upward since then. Construction also has slowed much like the rest of the nation. In the retail sector, many\nprojects in this area have been put on hold or delayed.\nThe pullback in real estate development activity has added to a decline in overall employment. About 5 percent of all jobs in Atlanta are in residential and commercial\nconstruction. The Atlanta area's unemployment rate has risen for the past four months and today is measured slightly above the nation as a whole, where the unemployment\nrate was 6.1 percent last month.\nAtlanta's economic hit has been broad-based. Jobs have been cut in financial services, manufacturing, and other industries. Earlier this year, the run-up of energy costs\nprompted layoffs at a variety of employers ranging from airlines to car dealerships. Also, because Atlantans travel more vehicle miles per day than any other major\nmetropolitan area, higher energy costs have hit households particularly hard.\nBecause of job losses and credit issues, consumer spending has been quite weak. As a result, Georgia sales tax collections in 2008 through September fell more than 4\npercent from a year earlier. Budget shortfalls have also affected the city of Atlanta and other area governments.\nLooking ahead\nMy economist colleagues at the Atlanta Fed often cite Georgia as a reasonable proxy for the U.S. economy. With Atlanta representing approximately two-thirds of the state\neconomy, we can assume a high correlation between Atlanta's trajectory and national trends.\nIn addition, Atlanta has earned a reputation over the past three decades as a \"world city.\" Author Joel Kotkin uses this term to describe a city that is highly integrated with the\nworld outside its immediate hinterland. Atlanta is highly connected to the world economy in its role as a transportation and logistics hub, trade entrepôt, headquarters city of\nglobal corporations, and provider of financial and business services.\nThis global status will serve the city well over the long term, but near-term prospects are not as positive. Export growth had been a bright spot in the nation's economy until\nrecently, but forecasts of global growth have been revised downward because of the financial crisis. Growth is likely to decline in developed economies in Europe and Pacific\nAsia, although the slowdown should be less pronounced in developing countries such as India and China.\nAtlanta cannot evade the downturn in national economic and international activity and the fallout of the recent financial crisis. But I believe Atlanta's problems in this period\nare cyclical, not structural. Atlanta enjoys core strengths and assets that will sustain the city's prosperity. Among these are a world-class airport and logistics infrastructure,\nhigher education infrastructure, growing tourism amenities, and the city's renowned physical beauty and agreeable climate.\nOf all metropolitan areas in the country, Atlanta had the nation's largest numerical gain in population from 2001 to 2007. Notably, Atlanta is recognized as a top city for young\nprofessionals. Over time, their continuing migration to this area should help ease the problem of excess supply in the housing market and contribute to a strong and vibrant\nlocal economy.\nLooking ahead at the U.S. economy, this is a period of vexing uncertainty. There has been a great deal of focus on credit availability and terms as a consequence of severe\nproblems in our banking system. Recent measures of credit conditions—ranging from interbank spreads to surveys of bank lending officers—has indeed been very\ndiscouraging. In response, a broad set of policies have been devised and forceful actions taken to mitigate the effects of this credit contraction. I believe these policies will\nwork.\nWith the deterioration in economic conditions and the recent associated falloff in energy and many other commodity prices, I anticipate further dissipation of inflationary\npressures. Nevertheless, given high inflation readings during the summer and into the fall, I'll continue to watch developments closely.\nWe at the Atlanta Fed expect weakness to persist for some time into 2009 as credit markets gradually improve. The thawing of credit markets is a necessary condition for a\nrecovery back to levels of growth consistent with the economy's underlying potential.\nClosing\nIn closing, Atlanta, along with the rest of the nation, is experiencing a period of financial turmoil and economic downturn. I am confident this will pass, and the solid strengths\nof our city—and the nation too—will express themselves in a return to health and growth.\n\n\fContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nA Working Financial Sector Matters to Us All\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nGreater New Orleans Inc.\nNew Orleans, La.\nSept. 30, 2008\nThanks for inviting me to speak to your distinguished group. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike brought back memories of Katrina and Rita three years ago\nand reminded onlookers around the country of the courage and resilience of the people of New Orleans in the face of manifold stresses brought by\nthese storms.\nToday we're in the midst of very stressed financial markets with the potential of doing serious damage to the broad economy—Main Street in the\ncurrent jargon—both here in the United States and abroad.\nIn a few moments, I will talk briefly about the domestic economic outlook. But considering the fluid and fast-moving developments in the financial\nmarkets during the last month, I feel some obligation to address the immediate matters that are front of mind for most Americans.\nSpecifically, I will comment on conditions in the financial markets. I will try to bring some perspective to the complex situation policymakers currently\nface. And I will try to draw the connections between the financial sector, where these problems currently reside, and the lives of ordinary citizens.\nAfter my remarks, I will be happy to take some of your questions. Let me add that the views I present are mine alone and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\nConditions\nLet me begin by trying to summarize the extraordinary situation that has developed this month (extraordinary even in the context of the continuing financial turmoil that began\nin August 2007 and has persisted for 13 months).\nCredit markets remain quite strained. This is particularly the case in interbank markets in the United States and abroad. The interbank markets are a fundamental element of\nthe plumbing of the financial world. Banks with excess balances put them to work by lending to other banks that have clients—companies and individuals—who need the\nfunds.\nThe loan portfolios of U.S. banks and financial institutions are, as you would expect, mostly dollar-denominated. But foreign banks in recent years have also built sizeable\n\"books of business\" in dollars. The dollar interbank credit contraction is a worldwide problem that affects not only our banks here but banks overseas, particularly in Europe.\nWhen banks lend or take on other forms of exposure to each other, they gauge the counterparty risk. In recent weeks, there has been a widespread withdrawal of confidence\nin counterparties that has resulted in efforts to reduce exposure.\nAs part of this, maturities have shortened, risk spreads (typically measured as the interest rate spread over U.S. Treasuries) have widened, the cost of hedging against\ndefault risk (another measure of perceived counterparty risk) has risen dramatically, and the range of assets accepted as collateral has narrowed. Also, demand for liquidity\nprovided by the Federal Reserve has intensified.\nThis contraction in availability and rise of the cost of credit have worsened as well for corporate and business borrowers. We've heard anecdotes confirming this from\ncontacts throughout the Southeast. In short, Main Street is being affected.\nThe balance sheets of many banks and financial institutions continue to be burdened by illiquid, impaired assets that—because they are illiquid—are exceedingly difficult to\nvalue. One frequently hears the complaint, \"No one knows what this stuff's worth.\"\nFinancial institutions worldwide have been trying to deleverage; that is, offload at acceptable prices some of their stock of impaired assets and generally bring down their\nleverage ratios. This has proven hard, if not impossible, to do. As you know, a high proportion of the troubled assets is made up of mortgage-backed securities whose\nfinancial performance—cash flow—is unstable because of the continuing delinquency and foreclosure saga. Uncertainty about what's in a security is compounded by\nuncertainty about how individual loans will perform. Projections of loan performance are, in turn, affected by an uncertain economic outlook. All of this has driven off almost\nany buyer interest in these securities.\nIn recent weeks, an extremely difficult environment in credit markets—both interbank and corporate—has spread to the sphere of money market mutual funds. Problems\nhave been felt mostly in institutional money market funds. Concern about fund exposure to financial institutions whose liquidity is deteriorating has prompted redemptions.\nNews of redemptions has raised worries—and a few actual cases—of money funds \"breaking the buck,\" taking principal losses. Money market funds were never supposed to\ndo that.\nIn response, earlier this month, the Fed introduced a new liquidity facility called the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF).\nThis facility provides liquidity to markets by extending loans to banking organizations to finance their purchases of high-quality asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) from\nmoney market mutual funds.\nSeptember events\nUp to this point, measures in response to conditions and developments have been incremental—dealing with problems as they arise one by one. Let me review the key\n\n\fdevelopments in the month of September:\nSunday, Sept. 7: The U.S. government placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. This action was taken to stabilize housing and mortgage finance markets.\nMonday, Sept. 15: Bank of America announced it agreed to buy the investment bank Merrill Lynch. Also, efforts to find a buyer of Lehman Brothers failed. The same day\nLehman Brothers announced it was going to declare bankruptcy.\nTuesday, Sept. 16: AIG received an emergency credit line from the Federal Reserve—an action supported by the Treasury—to facilitate an orderly downsizing of the\ncompany.\nFriday, Sept. 19: The Treasury's rescue plan was first publicly proposed. As you know, the ultimate proposal presented to Congress after extensive deliberations was voted\ndown yesterday in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nAlso on Sept. 19: As mentioned earlier, the Fed introduced the AMLF.\nMonday, Sept. 22: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley—the last two independent investment banks on Wall Street—were approved to convert their status to bank holding\ncompanies. This meant that going forward they would be supervised by federal banking regulators, conform to bank leverage ratios, and have access to the Fed discount\nwindow.\nFriday, Sept. 26: Washington Mutual, a $300 billion thrift, announced that most of its assets would be acquired by JP Morgan.\nMonday, Sept. 29 (yesterday): Wachovia announced that most of its banking assets would be acquired by Citigroup with federal assistance.\nThese events were the most notable effects of deteriorating trends in credit and financial markets that, if allowed to march on, pose a serious threat to the broad economy.\nLet me elaborate further on those trends.\nConditions, continued\nEquity markets are down significantly for the year, particularly in September.\nBond markets have been under significant stress, with major corporations finding it difficult and expensive to issue debt. New debt issuance was $15.5 billion in September of\nthis year compared with $101 billion in September of 2007.\nIn the so-called cash markets, which are short term and normally very liquid markets, commercial paper issuance has become increasingly difficult for large corporations.\nTotal commercial paper outstanding is down $244 billion from September 2007 and down $44 billion the week ending September 24.\nThese data on credit markets translate to accelerating shrinkage of business credit at all levels, from large corporations to small businesses.\nThe yield last Thursday on the one-month Treasury bill was 0.1 percent versus 3 percent at the beginning of the year and 1.6 percent at the beginning of September. This\ndrop in yields reflects a broad flight from risk.\nIn sum, the situation in September has been one of accelerating deterioration of the institutional and market landscape of our financial system.\nThese conditions are still with us and, as of yesterday, show no signs of relenting.\nIf they persist, they will surely evoke public policy responses in an effort to restore confidence in financial markets. Confidence will return with improved liquidity, more clarity\non the value of troubled assets, and the recapitalization of financial institutions. These are prerequisites of credit expansion in support of growth.\nThe ultimate aim is to avert serious costs to the total economy and facilitate the process of long-term economic recovery.\nImplications for real economy\nLet me turn to the question of the outlook for the total economy.\nAt the root of today's financial turmoil is housing sector weakness. In recent months, housing starts have declined sharply, and inventories of unsold new and existing homes\nremain high. With oversupply, house prices in most markets have continued to decline. Financial instability has affected house prices by tightening credit to potential home\nbuyers.\nPrior to September, we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had a rather downbeat outlook for the second half of 2008 and early 2009. We expected—and continue to\nexpect—a very weak second half reflecting contracting consumer spending, weaker business investment, and slower export volume.\nExport demand has been an important factor that has helped sustain the U.S. manufacturing sector in recent months. But economic growth prospects in many of our major\ntrading partners have weakened notably in recent months, and this weakening has dampened the outlook for the export sector.\nConditions in labor markets also have weakened. During the first half of 2008 the data showed that residential construction and related manufacturing industries were\nreducing their workforce while other businesses were hesitant to add to payrolls. But more recently the data suggest that layoffs have become more widespread, and hiring\nintentions have pulled back further.\nWeak labor markets feed into weak income growth and sluggish consumer spending. Reports from retailers suggest that the outlook for the upcoming holiday season has\nbeen pared back as consumers are expected to tighten their belts further. At the same time, lending standards for most types of consumer credit have tightened.\nLouisiana's economy is somewhat an anomaly in the current environment. Recovery efforts following the 2005 hurricanes mean that job creation continues. It's noteworthy\nthat total employment in the state has recently surpassed pre-Katrina levels, although New Orleans remains a much smaller city than before the storm.\n\n\fAs you may know, the Fed has a dual mandate that deals with growth and inflation.\nThough I and my staff take nothing for granted, I feel better about inflation. I believe the weaker economy combined with lower oil and commodity prices would serve to\nsuppress inflationary pressures, especially \"headline\" or overall inflation.\nOverall, the outlook for inflation may have improved, but prospects for growth have weakened. Importantly, I believe problems in our financial system add significant risk to\nthe downside for the economy.\nA working financial sector matters to us all. Credit is the lifeblood of a modern economy. Illiquid credit markets mean illiquid banks and ultimately illiquid businesses. I don't\nneed to explain to a room full of businesspeople what happens when credit dries up and a business becomes illiquid. Cash becomes king, efforts are made to accelerate\ninflows, and cash outlays are reduced. Managers focus on discretionary expenses, and then the biggest categories of cash outflows—salaries and investments. Jobs, and\nlivelihoods, are at stake.\nOur modern economy involves linkages that aren't always apparent—including vital connections between the financial sector and businesses and households. In my view, we\nneed to deal with today's problems in the financial sector realistically, pragmatically, and as a national community.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart’s biography • Atlanta Fed Speeches • Information Regarding Recent Federal Reserve Actions\n\n\f"

I have been working my way up the proverbial learning curve and have reached the point this morning of demonstrating the zealotry of a\nrecent convert.\nSince accepting our call to lead the Atlanta commission, Beverly and I have been immersed in the literature of the field and have made visits to\nplaces we believe are leaders in the field. Speaking for myself only, I have formed some preliminary views on the case for investment in early (prekindergarten) education. I believe that case is compelling—a \"no-brainer.\" If there is debate, I believe it appropriately concerns implementation—the\npractical details.\nFor the next several minutes, I'd like to walk you through my nonexpert understanding of the early education topic and share with you the preliminary views I will carry into the\ndeliberations of our commission, which kicks off Oct. 1.\nStarting with myself, our commission is not made up of subject experts. We've recruited prominent citizens from a wide array of backgrounds representing diverse\nconstituencies. These leaders are from business, foundations, government, criminal justice, education, media, entertainment, and the faith community.\nWe're launching our Atlanta commission with the firm conviction that business community involvement and leadership are vital to success, and for this reason we will try to\nframe early education not just as an education and social policy concern but also as an economic development issue.\nFraming the topic of early education as relevant to economic development encourages the use of a working vocabulary familiar to business people, including terms such as\n\"investment\" and \"return on investment,\" \"[business] model,\" and \"workforce competitiveness.\"\nIn my varied career, I've spent more time in business than any other sector. As a new zealot for early education, I favor the direct, pragmatic, impatient-with-rhetoric language\nof my business colleagues. In that spirit, let me put forth five propositions:\nKindergarten is too late. At least it's too late for many children, especially those from disadvantaged households. Children who do not arrive at kindergarten ready for the\nstructure and content of the formal education process are behind on day one. Many will never catch up.\nEarly education generates high returns. Return on investment can be calculated, and that return is competitive with or superior to many discrete projects typically justified\nin economic development terms.\nWe (society) can pay now or pay later. Failure in school forces channeling of resources—tax dollars, philanthropy, and United Way funding—to treatment of social\nproblems that are the consequence of that failure in school. Failure in school unquestionably contributes to the appalling statistics we see on phenomena such as school\ndropouts, teen pregnancy, crime, and incarceration.\nSuccess requires public and private leadership. For the foreseeable future, leadership action and effective delivery of early education will require a hybrid model.\nAchieving quality in early education requires concerted efforts on the part of the public education system, nonprofit agencies, for-profit providers, churches, and a diverse\nfunding community. Government financing and other support are likely to be necessary, but not sufficient. Business leadership—as is so often the case at the state and\ncommunity level—is critical to fill gaps and gain traction.\nFinally—my fifth argument—the train is leaving the station. Many states and communities across the country are moving forward on this issue, and momentum for early\nchildhood education is building. There is a growing recognition that this is an idea whose time has come and progressive communities ought to and are getting on with it.\nWith regard to international economic competition, the train has left the station. Many of our competitors are well ahead.\nTo back up these propositions, I will draw on research findings in neuroscience and economics and share some thoughts about the best practices I've observed. I will\nnecessarily be brief in describing some broader lessons of this experience.\nDefinitions, vocabulary and a key distinction\nBefore I go further, I'd like to give attention to some essential vocabulary and definitions. To begin with, there is the critical distinction between \"care\" and \"education.\"\nToo often, early childhood education—purposeful, structured curriculum-based learning—is confused with \"childcare\" or \"daycare.\" Worse, critics might dismiss these\nprograms as glorified babysitting.\nWhile education can take place in a childcare or home setting, the biggest social and economic benefits associated with early education flow from investments in high-quality\ncurriculum-based pre-kindergarten programs that begin as early as age 2. The highest returns come from investing in financially disadvantaged children who are at risk of\nfailure later in life because they haven't gotten a solid educational start.\n\n\fHigh-quality early education is nothing like babysitting. It typically involves well-qualified teachers, small classes, a research-validated curriculum, and family-support\nservices. This conference will address other early interventions (such as those related to health or family income) that may complement the educational investments that are\nthe focus in this talk.\nThe end game of early education is school readiness, specifically kindergarten readiness. Kindergarten readiness is typically defined by preparation in five domains. These\nare: physical well-being and motor development; personal, social, and emotional development; the arts and creativity; language and literacy development; and mathematical\nand analytical thinking.\nAdequate preparedness in all of these areas is needed before kids begin formal schooling and make their way through the K–12 system.\nThe neuroscience case\nA substantial body of research tells us that the foundations for language development, cognitive skills, and social competence—all critical components for success in school\nand, ultimately, in the workplace—are established before kindergarten. One expert argues that 85 percent of a child's brain structure develops in the first three years of life.\nAbout half of the children who reach kindergarten are not equipped with these skills.\nBrain development research has shaped the curricula of \"high-quality\" early childhood education programs. Programs are geared to provide children with the kinds of\nexperiences that strengthen the neural circuits underlying the skills needed for school success.\nLanguage development is particularly important because it is the strongest predictor of school success. Children with significant exposure to words in family and preschool\nsettings show up in kindergarten with a vocabulary exceeding 1,000 words.\nIt's been established that the vocabularies of children who grow up in disadvantaged homes are less than half those of children who come from homes with high incomes and\nhigh parent involvement. In the course of their early years, children in advantaged environments are exposed to literally millions more words through conversations or outloud reading.\nFor young children with special needs or from home environments with high levels of economic or emotional stress, early education may be especially important in reversing\nthe damage to the brain's circuitry caused by childhood trauma and stress.\nIn sum, the science underpinning formal early childhood education is well advanced and compelling.\nReturn on investment\nEven practitioners of the dismal science have weighed in on the payoff from early education. Economists perceive early education as relevant to human capital development,\nworkforce competitiveness, and, by extension, labor productivity and reduction of costly externalities such as crime and remedial public expenditures.\nThe work of Nobel laureate James Heckman and others builds a very convincing case that early childhood interventions—including enriched preschool centers coupled with\nhome visitation programs —are among the most effective investments in building the skills vital to productivity and success in an economy that depends increasingly on\nknowledge workers.\nTo quote Heckman (and co-author Dimitriy Masterov): \"Investing in disadvantaged young children is a rare public policy with no equity-efficiency tradeoff. It reduces the\ninequality associated with the accident of birth and at the same time raises the productivity of society.\"\nDispassionate observers will want cause-effect proof—or at least reasonably hard evidence—which isn't easy to muster given long timeframes and interplay of so many\nvariables. Longitudinal studies appropriate to the task must be carefully constructed to follow children with exposure to preschool programs over long time periods.\nOne well-documented longitudinal study began more than 40 years ago at Perry Preschool in Michigan. As I understand it, the study has tracked 123 at-risk children, with 58\nof them having participated in a high quality pre-K when they were 3 and 4 years old. Studies like this calculate a social rate of return that combines the private return from\nhigher lifetime earnings with the return to society from lower crime and incarceration and reduced need for social services. In this particular study, the annual social rate of\nreturn is 16 percent adjusted for inflation. About a fourth of the return accrues directly to individuals, but three-fourths of the benefits flows to society at large.\nOther studies using different methodology provide different numbers but reach the same conclusion: Investment in early childhood education is money well spent—yielding a\nstream of benefits from a better-skilled workforce, higher incomes, and a reduced need for taxpayer-funded social programs.\nA number of you attending this conference work in the economic development field and should be aware of this evidence as you consider decisions to allocate scarce\nresources. My colleague Art Rolnick, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, makes a compelling case that many project commitments and policies\njustified under the banner of economic development are low impact compared to early education. For instance, efforts to provide financial incentives for businesses to\nrelocate constitute a zero-sum game, simply moving jobs from one region to another. Raising average competence is a positive-sum endeavor. Given the benefits of\nworkforce competitiveness and the long-term costs of educational failure, Art argues that state and local governments would be much better off over the long term investing\nin high-quality early education than building costly sports stadiums or subsidizing manufacturing facilities.\nThe international competitiveness situation and case\nLet me now comment on the international competitiveness case for early learning. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), early\nchildhood education experienced a surge in policy attention around the world beginning in the early 1990s. In many other countries, children are now starting formal\neducation at younger ages than in the United States. For example, 95 percent of French children go to school at age 3 and the Swedish system offers preschool to children\nages 1 to 5, and 78 percent are in preschool by age 2.\nThese and other countries—including several in Western Europe—are more likely to have adopted a national philosophy to guide early education. Thus, the public sector\ngenerally drives the early education with a centralized policy.\nThis approach stands in contrast to the education model in the United States, which encourages local control with some flexibility to pursue innovation. As a result, early\neducation and childcare in this country have been largely shaped by market forces; that is, parents pay providers who respond to demand at the individual program level.\n\n\fMarket demand has risen as more women have entered and stayed in the labor force. Working mothers are a fact of modern life.\nThe public sector has been getting more involved over the past 10 years as state and local stakeholders have begun to see early education as an important part of the\neducation continuum. A majority of U.S. states now offer pre-K programs for some 4-year-olds. Some states have programs for 3-year-olds. In most states, delivery is\nthrough a mixture of private and public programs.\nThe flexibility offered by our system has the potential to contribute more to economic growth over time than a mandated one-size-fits-all model. Admittedly, at any given time,\na number of factors will determine how effectively the United States—and its component regions and communities—competes in a global economy. But I think it is\nreasonable to suggest that early education and its role in human capital development could be a key factor in improving the economic vitality of our communities and the\nnation's long-term international competitiveness. This topic will be more fully developed in a later session, so I will defer to that presentation.\nA role for business\nTo realize our workforce potential and the economic development impact of early learning here in the United States, there is a clear need for assertive leadership to bring\ntogether disparate public and private actors at a state or community level. And there is a legitimate role for the business community based on pragmatic self-interest.\nBusiness is a big stakeholder in the skill level and productivity of the workforce, so it stands to reason that business should be involved in shaping the early education\nagenda. The war for talent will be easier if there is more talent. I believe business has an important advocacy role, funding mobilization role, and a role of ensuring market\nincentives.\nImplementation realities\nIf the delivery model for early education is destined to be a public-private hybrid, what are its vital elements, its moving parts? I had that question in mind as I visited\nMinnesota, Miami, and North Carolina—all places that are known for innovative ideas and practices in this field. I learned that implementation involves coordination of a\ncomplex array of important elements—funding, accreditation, training, parental involvement, and overall leadership.\nIn our decentralized national reality, implementation strategies differ in approach, scope, and emphasis. There does not appear to be a single delivery model for high-quality\nearly education. But some or all of the following features are necessary:\nformal and institutionalized quality standards (teacher qualifications, class size, and curricula),\na rating system and trusted entity to oversee it,\ntechnical assistance for providers,\nfamily support services, such as parent mentoring,\nidentification and targeting of at-risk children, and\nstable sources of adequate funding—particularly funding that makes programs affordable and accessible to less advantaged families and single mothers.\nMinnesota is putting emphasis on solving the funding challenge through an endowed scholarship program for at-risk children. Their concept empowers parents to choose\nproviders in a competitive market.\nMiami is emphasizing technical assistance to providers and overall leadership to be delivered by a center of excellence organized under the auspices of the United Way.\nNorth Carolina's approach involves decentralized local program development funded by state and business dollars governed by a public-private oversight board.\nI know there are other nodes of early education leadership and innovation. I hope to visit others in the coming months and develop a good sense of the national landscape in\nthis arena.\nIn their communities, committed individuals make a huge difference. For example, in Minnesota, leadership comes from Duane Benson (chief executive officer of the\nMinnesota Early Learning Foundation), key private sector companies, and my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. In Miami, David Lawrence, former\npublisher of the Miami Herald, has developed a national reputation for his leadership in this cause. In North Carolina, former Gov. Jim Hunt played a key role. In addition, a\nrange of leaders from the public and private sector—including North Carolina's large banks—keep the North Carolina Partnership for Children and its Smart Startinitiative\ngoing.\nThe Atlanta case\nIn Atlanta, we're not starting from zero. Georgia benefits from a lottery-funded voluntary universal statewide pre-K program for 4-year-olds that includes content standards,\napproved curricula models, quality assessment, and onsite monitoring. But in 2007–08 this program only reached 57 percent of the nearly 134,000 four-year-olds in the state.\nThe participation rate in metro Atlanta—where about half of Georgia's 4-year-olds reside—is barely 50 percent.\nSmart Start Georgia, led by the United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta, has worked to significantly increase the number of nationally accredited childcare centers across the\nstate. We also have some good models of teacher training and technical assistance in some communities. Yet we need to find ways to replicate these models and extend\ntheir reach.\nA key challenge for a populous region such as greater Atlanta is taking implementation strategies that have proven to be effective in smaller settings and extending them to\nmore children—scaling them. While we've made great progress in Georgia, we have much work to do to achieve a fully built-out delivery mechanism with all of the elements I\nlisted earlier. I am encouraged that we are starting with some critical elements already in place and a commission of diverse leaders—including several business leaders—\nwilling to learn about this issue, set aggressive goals, and deliver recommendations with practical steps for implementation.\nConclusion\nAs I said up front, this subject matter is new to me, and I expect to learn a lot in the coming months. So I must couch my propositions and observations in predictable caveats\n—they are preliminary, tentative, and revisable. But let me make a bold claim about the long-term future. In time, development of our children in formal pre-K programs will\nbegin at age 2. And by age 5, our population of children will be on a much surer path to individual success in school and readiness to compete as adults in the global\neconomy.\n\n\fREFERENCES\nCenter on the Developing Child at Harvard University.

Mack Robinson College of Business\nEconomic Outlook Conference\nAtlanta, Georgia\nAugust 27, 2008\nI'm aware that Georgia State's College of Business (now the Robinson College of Business) has been convening these economic outlook\nconferences since at least the 1980s, when I previously lived in Atlanta. You've earned a fine reputation. I'm honored to be included in the program\nthis morning.\nThe stock in trade of Federal Reserve Bank presidents is the economic outlook speech. Later this morning Rajeev Dhawan will provide his views on\nthe outlook. Instead of competing with such a well-regarded economic forecaster, I will devote my remarks to the topic of inflation.\nOn August 14, the July reading of the so-called headline consumer price index was released. The 12-month inflation rate through July was\nmeasured at 5.6 percent, the highest since 1991. This is a high and worrisome number.\nI've titled my talk this morning \"Inflation beyond the headlines.\" Central bankers aren't especially known for clever wordplay, but the title was meant\nto suggest both a deeper treatment of the topic and a look at the phenomenon of inflation beyond so-called headline inflation: the inflation you and I experience as\nconsumers. I plan to cover the current state of inflation in our economy, some instructional information and views on inflation analytics, and my near-term outlook for inflation.\nI must emphasize I am speaking only for myself. The views I will express are mine alone and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nWhat do we mean by inflation?\nLet me begin by posing the simple question: What do we mean by \"inflation\"? The answer to that simple question isn't as simple as it may seem.\nThe popular treatment of inflation in our sound bite society risks confusing inflation with relative price movements and the cost of living. By cost of living, I'm referring to the\ncosts you and I incur to maintain our level of consumption of various goods and services including essential items such as food, gasoline, and lodging.\nRelative price movements occur continuously in an economy as individual prices react to market forces affecting that good or service. Neither relative price movements nor\nsustained high living costs constitute inflation as economists commonly use the term.\nUp front, I want to be clear that I'm well aware recent cost increases have hurt many households and businesses, especially those heavily dependent on transportation.\nBelieve me, I'm not happy about paying $3.80 for a gallon of gasoline, and I know you're not either.\nIn the past three months, costs faced by the average urban family as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) have risen at an annualized rate of more than 10 percent.\nFood and energy accounted for about two-thirds of that rise. But the higher cost of maintaining consumption—while certainly painful—is not exactly the same thing as higher\ninflation. Let me explain.\nEarly in the last century, the economist Irving Fisher offered a vivid metaphor for the movement of individual costs relative to the aggregate level of inflation. The general\ninflation, he said, can be thought of as the movement of the swarm of bees. He likened the relative movement of individual prices (both up and down) to the movement of\nindividual bees within the swarm. Now, I admit that Fisher's analogy may be simplistic. Not all prices move in the same direction, but consumers tend to pay greater attention\nto rising prices than those that are falling. Recently, the average price of personal computing has declined while energy and food costs have increased.\nMonetary policy discussions are focused on the movement over time of the swarm, or the aggregate price level. That is where monetary policy holds its influence over\nprices.\nTo keep track of overall inflation there are two commonly used measures: the consumer price index, or CPI, and the personal consumption expenditure price index, or PCE\nprice index. Both measures are expenditure-weighted averages of price changes for a notional basket of goods and services. They seldom mirror an individual consumer's\npersonal experience.\nThe differences between the two measures are largely conceptual. For instance, the CPI measure is based on an average consumer's out-of-pocket expenditure while the\nPCE index is based on the total cost of the expenditure. So, while the total cost of pharmaceutical drugs is counted in the PCE index, only the consumer's insurance co-pay\nis counted in the CPI.\nAlso, the PCE price index updates the consumer basket continuously over time while the CPI is fixed every two years. By this method, the PCE better reflects the tendency\nfor substitution, such as buying more chicken if the price of beef goes up.\nIn my view, the compositional differences don't clearly favor one index versus the other. While the level of the inflation rate measured by the two indices differs at any point in\ntime, over the short term both generally give the same signal about the pattern of inflation.\nTaken together, measures of both CPI and PCE inflation are important tools to help get a fix on the overall inflation picture, giving us a sense of whether the inflation is\npersistent or transitory along with other information needed to make informed policy decisions.\n\n\fAt times, large movements in some component prices may mask the underlying inflation trends in the CPI and PCE indexes. For this reason, measures of core inflation can\nbe useful tools. Measures of core inflation typically remove volatile food and energy costs from the overall CPI or PCE number.\nInsights can be drawn from some alternative measurements of core inflation. For instance, the Cleveland Fed's median CPI and the Dallas Fed's trimmed mean PCE index\ncalculate inflation after stripping out extreme price changes—both high and low. Other approaches to refine core measures of inflation involve using statistical techniques.\nBefore I go any further, I will say that I agree with those who say core inflation measures in isolation are an inadequate approach to determining the direction of overall price\nchanges. Like you, I ultimately care about the trend rate of overall inflation, which I believe is ultimately the appropriate object of monetary policy.\nUpward movements of individual prices may take a variety of forms. For instance, smaller portions or downgraded quality for the same price, removal of service or warranty\nfeatures accompanying a product, changes in packaging where the package has utility—all these represent individual item inflation. They are called quality changes. The\nagencies that compute the CPI and PCE indexes work to account for these quality changes.\nAttempts to measure the aggregate rate of price change—no matter how sophisticated—remain imperfect. As a result, when it comes to measuring inflation, judgment is\nneeded to distinguish persistent price movements that underlie overall inflation from the relative price adjustments. Separating the inflation signal from noise involves much\nuncertainty—especially when making decisions in real time. Discerning accurately the underlying trend is difficult. It is essential for those of us who have responsibility for\nresponding to these trends to use a wide variety of core measures and inflation projections to make the most informed judgment we can.\nToday's U.S. inflation\nWith that, let me turn to the current inflation situation. No matter how you measure it, the aggregate inflation we are experiencing in the United States at the moment is\nuncomfortably high. Over the first half of this year, the CPI has risen at an annualized rate of nearly 5.5 percent. Over the same period, the PCE index has risen at an\nannualized rate of 4.5 percent. With the surge of energy prices in early summer, the annualized CPI for July was the highest in 17 years.\nAlso, considering the global context, I should add that consumer inflation measures in most parts of the world also have moved higher in recent months. Headline inflation\nrose to above 4 percent in major developed economies in July. In developing economies, inflation has been running at the highest rate since the start of the decade. On the\npositive side, inflation in China has declined in recent months to around 6 percent from a peak of 9 percent at the beginning of the year.\nMeasures of core inflation in the United States suggest that overall price pressures have been on the rise, perhaps because higher commodities costs have begun to affect\nprices paid by consumers and businesses across a broader range of other goods and services. In July, core CPI inflation on a year-over-year basis increased 2.5 percent—\nup from an average annual rate last year of 2.3 percent.\nHow did we get here? The mechanical answer, of course, is the outsized rise of particularly prominent prices in the consumption basket, notably food and energy. The rate of\nchange in the food and beverages component of the CPI, which accounts for about 15 percent of the total market basket, rose at an annual rate of slightly more than 6.5\npercent in the first half of this year.\nOver this time, the fuel and utilities piece of housing prices increased at an annual pace of nearly 21 percent and motor fuel by about 32 percent. In the CPI these two\ncomponents account for more than 10 percent of total household expenditure.\nI expect the recent decline in oil prices will begin to reverse some of the pressures we have seen on overall inflation in the first half of the year. But the underlying global\nsupply pressures remain tight, and demand pressures remain relatively high. As such, any relief will likely be only partial.\nFurthermore, some government estimates suggest little respite from food price hikes in the near term. At this point, it seems quite probable that PCE index inflation this\ncalendar year will clock in at more than 3.5 percent and the CPI somewhere north of 4 percent—an improvement over the first half of the year, and trending in the right\ndirection, but not numbers I would be comfortable with over the longer term.\nOutlook and risks\nAlthough recent measures of inflation are higher than I would like to see, I would say that recent price increases are more likely to be transitory than persistent. I expect that\nCPI inflation will peak near the July level of 5.6 percent. By comparison, in March 1980 the CPI peaked at 14.8 percent.\nLet me elaborate in the context of current Fed policy. On August 5 the FOMC voted to leave the fed funds rate at 2 percent and issued the following statement: \"Inflation has\nbeen high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated. The\nCommittee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.\"\nI concur with that view and believe current Fed policy is consistent with an easing in overall inflation given the dynamics of the economy. With weak growth and financial\nmarket strains, I believe the most likely outcome is that both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year as the temporary effects of\nenergy and food price increases abate. Note that my outlook does not require that food and energy prices fall, but simply that their rates of increase moderate.\nSome of you may wonder why a central bank would allow higher energy prices to push up measured inflation even in the short run. Let me respond to that question by\nposing a counterfactual argument.\nSuppose that in the current environment of weakening economic growth the FOMC were to lean heavily against the recent run-up in energy prices. Because monetary policy\nnecessarily works on prices in the aggregate—the swarm—tightening policy would lower the dollar value of all prices, including oil. Unless monetary policy can materially\naffect demand and supply fundamentals in global oil markets, energy would still be expensive relative to other goods and services. Also, energy would still be expensive\nrelative to wages whose dollar values likely would decline because of policy actions that restricted growth in the entire economy.\nIt might be possible for restrictive monetary policy to slow the economy enough to reduce the demand for energy and soften prices overall as a consequence. I doubt,\nhowever, that many people would be happy with attempts to solve the problem of high oil prices through policies that would deliberately reduce the real incomes of American\nconsumers and wage-earners.\n\n\fWhy expectations matter\nWith my inflation outlook, I do not mean to dismiss the very real threats to Fed objectives. In today's geopolitical environment, for instance, there's always the potential of a\nsevere energy price shock.\nAlso, my forecast could be wrong. If overall prices do not moderate in the near term as I expect, inflation expectations could become unmoored.\nIn the long run, the crux of the problem is not the elevated overall rate of inflation per se. It is the prospect that these elevated rates of inflation persist to such an extent that\nthey become embedded in expectations and mainstreamed into the price and wage setting decisions of businesses, workers, and consumers.\nIn such an event, the decisions required to serve the FOMC's dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable growth would become very difficult indeed. We need\nnot look back many years to recall the seriousness of unfettered inflation expectations. During the so-called Great Inflation between 1965 and 1984, the average CPI inflation\nrate for this extended period was 6.3 percent and PCE index averaged 5.6 percent.\nThis persistent run-up in prices was reversed only after the Fed raised the fed funds rate to extremely high levels. Victory was achieved at great cost to the real economy and\nonly after inflation expectations were brought back under control. Such an episode need not recur—even with temporarily elevated prices—if the Fed acts as needed to keep\ninflation expectations anchored.\nThere are three commonly cited measures for inflation expectations: economic forecasts, such as the ones you will be hearing at this conference, surveys of households, and\nfinancial data such as the term structure of interest rates. One example of the latter is Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS.\nTaken as a whole, these measures suggest inflation expectations may have risen modestly—but not by a material degree. By that, I mean not sufficient for me to think Fed\npolicies have been off target with respect to the central bank responsibility for price stability. But like measurements of inflation, measurements of inflation expectations also\nare far from perfect. For instance, surveys of household inflation expectations can be criticized as flawed stemming from the way questions are posed and the size and\nselection of the sample. Further, because financial market data reflect more than inflation expectations, these data are not always reliable indicators.\nSome fear inflation expectations are on the move in reaction to recent experience. As suggested a moment ago, I don't hold that view. But I feel that it's important to\nacknowledge that not enough is known about transitional periods from one state of expectations to another. Even though we're measuring expectations, there's an element of\nlooking back to gauge their essence. I do not dismiss the view that we run the risk that by the time change in expectations is clear, it's too late. In my view, we need to know\nmore about how and why inflation expectations shift.\nThat said, years of hard work by economists have gone into developing the measures of inflation expectations we currently track. And I have challenged our Atlanta Fed\nresearch staff to build on this progress.\nProtecting hard-won credibility\nTo recap, I acknowledge that current prices—no matter how measured—have been elevated. Thankfully, commodity prices appear to have declined somewhat, though there\nis no certainty that they will continue to be better behaved. And, some pass through has unquestionably occurred.\nIn this context, with higher commodity costs causing painful increases in the cost of living, I believe we should not let the sting of individual bees divert our attention from the\ndirection of the swarm. I believe the Fed's central concern is evidence of broad-based, persistent, and increasingly institutionalized upward price pressures.\nLike many forecasts, the Atlanta Fed's forecast shows the inflation trend moving gradually lower as general economic weakness eases some price pressures. My belief is\nthat the Fed has undertaken tactically prudent actions to help move the economy through a difficult transition in line with the larger strategic goals of sustainable growth, low\nand stable inflation over the long term, and financial stability. Also, let me emphasize that I am mindful of today's elevated risks and am prepared at any point to change\ntactics to ensure inflation expectations do not become unanchored.\nFurther, I'm acutely aware that the current FOMC has inherited the inflation policy credibility that was hard won by our predecessors. One thing that has impressed me since\ntaking my position last year is the seriousness with which my colleagues approach the duty to protect that legacy. I am confident that the Federal Reserve's institutional\ncommitment to maintaining low and stable inflation will prevail.\nThank you. I would be happy to respond to your questions and comments.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nRemarks on Economic Slowdown, Market Fallout, and the Path to Financial Recovery\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nGeorgetown University Library Associates panel discussion\nWashington, D.C.\nJuly 1, 2008\nMy thanks to Artemis Kirk and the Georgetown Library for sponsoring this event. I'd like to organize my remarks this evening around three\nquestions suggested by the title of the session. First, I will comment on the current state of the financial markets and the general economy. Second,\nvery briefly, I'll review the path to our current situation—how we got here. Third, I'll offer some views on the path to financial and economic recovery\nand the likely preconditions and requisites for sustained recovery.\nThe current circumstances seem to me to be best described as an intersection of three serious and interacting challenges—weakness in the\ngeneral economy, uncomfortable levels of inflation, and continuing threats to financial stability. Economic weakness is demonstrated in growth rates\nwell below potential and deteriorating unemployment measures.\nHeadline inflation numbers reflect the rising cost of oil and other commodities. The turmoil and dysfunction in financial markets, although less in the\nlast few weeks, have not completely receded. These pressures present policy makers with tactical trade-offs in the short term. They are not in\nconflict, however, over the long term.\nThe current economy and financial situation\nThe domestic economy has performed better in the first half than many expected. After two quarters of very strong growth in the middle of 2007, we saw a severe drop-off in\neconomic activity in the fourth quarter, giving rise to a forecast at the beginning of the year for a weak first half followed by gradual improvement in the second half. First\nquarter GDP growth recently was revised up twice to 1 percent, and the second quarter is expected to come in substantially above that number.\nEmployment conditions have weakened gradually since last year as the slowdown has taken hold. The headline unemployment number now stands at 5.5 percent, up a\npercentage point from the middle of last year. Half of this jump occurred in May. Nonetheless, the economy has been eliminating nonfarm jobs at an average rate of 38,000 a\nmonth in April and May, following a monthly average of 82,000 in the first quarter.\nA sizeable portion of the job losses has been in residential housing construction, though job declines have been broad-based. The wrenching correction underway in the\nhousing sector is at the center of our current financial and economic difficulties. House prices continue to fall. The April Case-Schiller index of house prices in 20 cities was\ndown 15.3 percent from a year earlier. The OFHEO index showed a 12-month decline of 4.6 percent through April.\nThe continuing decline of house prices has influenced buyer reticence, which has been compounded by the difficulty of selling existing homes and finding financing. As a\nresult, inventories of new and existing homes on the market have been hovering at around 11 months' supply for several months, well above a normal, healthy level.\nHome sales in May came in close to the average level of the past several months at an annualized rate around half a million units. Building permits and housing starts\ndeclined in May to annualized rates just below one million. The home building slowdown—while painful—is widely considered a prerequisite for reduction of house market\ninventories.\nConsumer activity has held up better than expected in light of the weak economy. The growth of consumer spending has been decelerating since 2006 but by one measure\njumped up in May after upward revisions for March and April. The May number suggests the rebate checks associated with the fiscal stimulus package are having some\neffect. About half the rebate checks went out in May.\nThis better-than-expected personal consumption performance contrasts starkly with consumer confidence. The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence for June\nfell to a 16-year low.\nAlso, business investment in recent months has been soft. The rate of investment in equipment and software in the first quarter was flat and is projected to remain weak in\nthe second quarter.\nNet exports have been a positive contributor to the economy, compensating for domestic weakness. Solid, though somewhat weaker, growth overseas combined with the\neffects of dollar depreciation has kept exports growing.\nTurning to the inflation picture, annual headline inflation in recent months has been high and rising. Energy and food commodity prices have pushed headline consumer price\nindex (CPI) inflation to 4.1 percent year-over-year. Finished goods producer prices—as captured in the headline producer price index (PPI)—rose at an annual rate of more\nthan 7 percent as of May.\nThese \"headline\" measures have diverged somewhat from the more stable \"core\" measures that exclude the effects of energy and food prices. The year-over-year core CPI\nrate in May increased 2.3 percent—above my personal comfort level—but well below and less volatile than headline numbers of late.\nMeasures of expectations of future inflation have edged higher, with short-term expectations moving up more than long-term ones. So far, there is little indication that higher\nactual inflation or inflation expectations have factored into wages and salaries.\n\n\fLet me complete the current picture with comments on the financial markets, particularly the credit markets. There is widespread anecdotal and hard evidence of a credit\ncontraction in both bank lending markets and credit capital markets. Investment-grade corporate credit markets seem to be functioning, but other credit markets (mortgagebacked securities, leveraged loans, other consumer credit structured securities, and municipal finance) remain fragile and vulnerable.\nVery importantly, interbank credit markets continue to be stressed, reflecting concern over exposure to still volatile and declining asset values. The banking system now\nexhibits some signs of stress at all levels—large financial institutions, regional banks, and community banks.\nHow we got here\nThe story of how the economy arrived at its current state is familiar but worth re-examining for clues about the path to recovery.\nIf one takes a long view, the salient points are these:\nsix years of economic expansion from December 2001 through 2007 fueled in part by a surplus of global savings and ample liquidity;\nthe growth of structured finance capital markets in the context of a three-decade evolution of our financial system from bank-centric to market-centric;\nlarge amounts of global liquidity finding an outlet in housing investment, pushing prices ever higher; and\npricing of risk through last summer showing symptoms of ever onward-and-upward market psychology...until last August!\nThe shorter view is a story, beginning last summer, of the subprime mortgage-backed securities and foreclosure crisis, spread of illiquidity to several markets, a retreat from\nand radical repricing of risk, distrust among counterparties in the essential interbank credit markets, and the resulting rapid delevering of the financial system across the\nboard.\nThe Fed responded by providing liquidity through a number of different facilities to encourage the orderly functioning of financial markets. And since last September, the\nfederal funds rate has been lowered from 5.25 percent to the current level of 2 percent.\nWhat's ahead\nI know you are most interested in the path from here—the path to recovery in the financial markets and, by my inclusion, the broader economy. My base case forecast for the\neconomy involves a stronger-than-expected first half of 2008 with growth of 1 to 2 percent but not much pickup in the second half. The drag of high energy costs, continuing\nfinancial market stress, and a still-declining housing sector may continue for a while with gradual improvement of growth in 2009.\nThere is much uncertainty surrounding this outlook. More adverse alternative scenarios are entirely possible. Self-reinforcing progressive deterioration could continue in the\nhousing market, in turn affecting the financial markets. And neither the financial markets nor the overall domestic economy is protected from surprise events around the\nworld.\nLike many, I believe stabilization of the housing sector is required for recovery to proceed. There are early and tentative signs that a bottom may be forming in some housing\nmarkets. Having said that, a sober approach to calling the future must allow for an additional period of house price decline, a slow housing sector recovery, and, as a result, a\nquite choppy progression to better markets and economy.\nEyes on inflation\nIn closing, let me emphasize that I'm taking the recent inflationary pressures very seriously. A path to recovery involving stronger growth but with higher and persistent\ninflation would fit the old adage about winning the battle but losing the war.\nFor that reason, in my view, the current set of circumstances calls for being especially vigilant and attentive to public and business psychology as regards costs and prices.\nPolicy needs to react decisively against signs of the onset of formal compensating practices, including contracts, that treat inflation as a persistent reality—in other words,\nsomething that must be lived with. Such signs are not apparent, and I don't expect them to materialize.\nThank you.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart’s biography • Press release • Speaker’s bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nJapan's Importance to the U.S. and Southeast Economies\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nJapan-America Society of Georgia\nAtlanta, Ga.\nJune 4, 2008\nIt's an honor for me to join you this evening as your speaker for the Japan-America Society of Georgia annual dinner.\nI'm here tonight as both the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and a former banker and private citizen who is a longtime admirer of\nmany things Japanese. Earlier in my career I had substantial experience with Japanese companies and visited Japan several times. My talk will\nrepresent both my perspective as a current Federal Reserve official and musings and remembrances from earlier experience.\nRise of China and India\nI'd like to begin my remarks with a potentially controversial statement. Japan has receded in the consciousness of the American business\ncommunity, and public attention in this country has turned away from the relationship between the United States and Japan. For the last few years,\nChina has been top of mind. Americans have grown increasingly aware of the rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse and destination for\noffshored American manufacturing jobs, as a consumer product exporter to our market, and, recently, as an important financial and industrial\ninvestor in U.S. assets. I could add to that the growing profile of India as a services provider.\nBut I don't need to tell this group that Japan still matters to the United States and especially to the economy of the Southeast region. And the Southeast is important to Japan.\nLet me flesh out the picture.\nJapan's importance to the U.S. Southeast\nFor the purposes of my argument, I will define the Southeast as roughly the same geography as the Sixth Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Georgia, Florida, and\nAlabama and parts of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee. We could add other states to my definition of the Southeast, and that would only serve to strengthen the case.\nThis region is economically diverse, with a composition of industries similar to the nation as a whole. The population of the six states in this region is about 45 million, and the\nregion's economic output last year was about $1.8 trillion. If the region were ranked as a nation, the Southeast's economy would rank eighth in the world, below Italy and\nabove Canada. By comparison, Japan, the second-largest economy in the world, had a GDP in 2007 of $4.4 trillion.\nFor the past two decades, the Southeast has grown more rapidly than the United States as a whole. There are many reasons for this growth, but among them is the region's\nattractiveness to businesses, including foreign investment. Japan has been a very important source of investment throughout the United States and especially in the\nSoutheast.\nJapan is the second-largest investor in the United States (after the United Kingdom). Japanese companies in 2005 employed about 614,000 people in the United States,\nincluding more than 100,000 in the Southeast as defined by the Atlanta Fed's Sixth District states. That number is up from about 90,000 in 1995, which suggests Japan's\neconomic commitment to the Southeast is ongoing.\nWithin this region, Georgia plays an important logistical role. This state offers excellent port and air transport facilities along with other essential commercial infrastructure.\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Japanese firms increased their investment in commercial property in Georgia from $779 million to $859 million. Based on available data,\nemployment at Japanese-affiliated companies in Georgia is about 25,000.\nThe Southeastern state where Japanese firms own the most real estate is Florida, which is the most populous state in our district and the state with the largest economic\noutput. Japanese firms in 2005 owned $1.2 billion of commercial property in Florida. Also, about 19,000 Floridians are employed by Japanese companies.\nElsewhere in the Southeast—notably Alabama, Tennessee, and Mississippi—Japanese firms have led the development of highly efficient vehicle manufacturing and\nassembly facilities. Between 1995 and 2005—the most recent year for which data are available—Japanese firms in these three states increased hiring from about 38,000 to\nmore than 54,000 jobs.\nVehicle assembly in this region has grown at a time when employment in the industry nationally has declined. But with weak economic and consumer spending growth in the\nUnited States during the past year, auto plants have cut back vehicle production. The reduced flow of auto imports from Japan and elsewhere has been reflected in lower\nimport traffic at major ports in this region.\nOf course, investment and trade go in both directions. Japan in 2007 accounted for 7 percent of all U.S. imports and 6 percent of U.S exports. From the reverse perspective,\nabout 23 percent of Japan's exports went to the United States. Clearly, this country continues to be an important market for Japan.\nGeorgia's goods exports to Japan in 2007 amounted to $1.2 billion, including the shipment of transportation equipment, machinery, and chemicals.\nWith any economy, the financial sector is important. Japanese banks started building a presence in the Southeast when I lived in Atlanta back in the 1980s. By 1991, there\nwere 11 Japanese banks with offices in Georgia and Florida with assets totaling $3.9 billion. By 1999, most of the Japanese banks had closed their Southeast offices. Today,\nI'm aware of only two Japanese bank offices that operate in Georgia.\n\n\fWhy the retreat? Much of this had to do with retrenchment in the Japanese banking industry as Japan dealt domestically with a decade of recession and slow growth.\nJapanese banks in the 1980s became overextended by making loans to businesses whose collateral later collapsed in value. Many borrowers struggled to make payments,\nand Japanese lenders had to take enormous losses on bad loans. This financial instability spilled over to the broader Japanese economy and led to an extended period of\nslow growth. Between 1989 and 2001 the wealth of the private sector in Japan declined by more than $10 trillion—two to three times the value of the economy's annual\neconomic output. This period—sometimes called \"the lost decade\"—was characterized by very low interest rates calibrated to resist deflation and stimulate economic growth.\nExpectations for a different experience\nSome have argued that the United States is today in a similar position to that of Japan in 1989 and will suffer a similar prolonged period of economic weakness. I understand\nwhy this connection is being made as both episodes were preceded by rapid appreciation in asset prices—often called bubbles—followed by rapid depreciation, as we are\nexperiencing today with house prices.\nI do not expect this country to experience the same protracted economic weakness as Japan, in part because we can learn from Japan's experience in order to avoid\nsomething similar. Taking lessons from the Japanese experience, we here in the United States must come to grips with broad systemic inadequacies and make necessary\nchanges. Affected financial companies are already well into the process of loss recognition and recapitalization. In the coming months and years we can expect substantial\nimprovements in the area of risk management and liquidity management even to the extent of fundamental changes of their business models. Also, the debate on reform of\nthe regulatory framework has already begun. Years of economic performance are at stake, and I'm confident we will muster the will to make the necessary changes.\nHistorical precedent supports my view. In the late 1980s, the United States went through the savings and loan crisis. Recognition of the scope of the problem took some time,\nbut ultimately U.S. policymakers were able to respond aggressively with a comprehensive resolution of the problems of impaired assets, insolvent institutions, and weak\nmanagement.\nThere is one similarity between the situation in Japan in the '90s and the reality today in the U.S. financial system that gives pause. One explanation for the slow response in\nJapan was the relatively more opaque nature of its banking system, reflecting the complex relationship culture of Japanese business. Much has been written recently about\nthe so-called \"shadow banking system\" of hedge funds and complex securities in the United States that also renders much of our financial system opaque. Improved\ntransparency must accompany other reforms as an early priority.\nCultural differences but mutual respect\nNeed I remind this group that our two countries differ profoundly culturally? A book that has influenced my thinking on our cultural differences is The Seven Cultures of\nCapitalism by Charles Hampden-Turner and Alfons Trompenaars. In surveys of businesspeople in a dozen or more countries asking them how they would resolve value\ndilemmas, American and Japanese businesspeople were often at opposite ends of the spectrum. Yet, during the last 60 years a symbiotic partnership has developed and\nmatured, yielding great benefits to both countries. I would argue that the relationship between Japan and the United States stands as perhaps the world's most prominent\nexample of pragmatic cooperation between peoples who, if not opposites culturally, are at least very, very different.\nIt hasn't always been so, but I believe the relationship works so well because of a high quotient of mutual respect. Let me share some personal remembrances in that vein.\nFrom 1988 to 2001, I worked closely with a number of Japanese bankers from then Fuji Bank, now Mizuho. There was much I admired in my Japanese colleagues, and I\nlearned a lot from them that I've taken to heart.\nThere are two allied notions in Japanese business culture—seijitsu (sincerity) and wa (harmony). In a few words, sincerity is the proper discharge of one's duties and\nobligations no matter what. It's about dedication to the interests of the company or team and the subordination of one's personal interests to the interests of the institution that\nemploys you.\nWa, as I said, means harmony. It is the ideal that informs the teamwork culture in Japanese organizations. Two of my colleagues rose to become eventual presidents of Fuji\nBank, and a number rose to become managing directors—the senior most position below president. I observed that the personality types that lead Japanese organizations\nare quite different than those we often reward with high positions in American business culture. Japanese leaders are skillful facilitators of organizational harmony and\nteamwork.\nAt a higher, less personal, level, I believe Japanese concepts have been internalized here in American business culture and have served to make the United States more\ncompetitive. Kaizen, continuous improvement, is widely practiced as a requirement of competitive survival. Kanban, just-in-time supply, with the commitment to absolute\nreliability it implies, is now an essential element of the sophisticated supply chains of American and global manufacturers and retailers.\nThere is irony in this assertion that Japanese ideas have become Americanized because the intellectual origins of kaizen and kanban techniques, and the encompassing\nconcept of total quality management, are widely attributed to two Americans: Edwards Deming and Joseph Juran. Both were prophets ignored in their home countries, to\nparaphrase the old saying, so they took their ideas of statistical quality control in manufacturing processes to Japan after the Second World War. Their message, in a\nnutshell, was \"do it right the first time.\" Six Sigma is a descendant of Deming and Juran.\nI know from personal experience that Japanese executives working here have learned from their American colleagues. In my observation, my Japanese colleagues learned\nmuch about risk taking, risk management, and risk-reward calculation. They learned about rapid decision-making, competitive differentiation, and invention of contrarian\nbusiness models. Speaking of his experience in an aggressive, risk-taking American financial company, one of my Japanese friends said, \"You are hunters, and we are\nfarmers.\"\nThere is one other Japanese concept I admire because it demonstrates the Japanese sense of humor. It is chindogu. I am a prospective member of the International\nChindogu Society. For the Americans here tonight, chindogu is the Japanese word for the art of the \"unuseless\" invention. Unuseless here means almost completely useless,\nbut with just a hint of serious purpose. Examples of chindogu inventions are eyelid clips to stay awake in boring meetings. Or bedroom slippers encased in dust mops to\nclean your floor while you shuffle around the house. I submitted the idea of advertising bibs for cows grazing beside highways, but this idea has actually been put into\npractice in Holland. A rule of the International Chindogu Society is, if you invent something that turns out to be so handy you actually use it, you have failed to make a\nchindogu. You should go to the patent office.\nLoyalty and livelihood\nI have a serious thought—related to chindogu—as I close. In an earlier speech some months ago, I argued that in this world of global commerce, global brands, international\ntrade and cross-border investment, and complex international supply chains, our notion of product loyalty should be updated. I argued that in many product categories,\n\n\fnational identity is increasingly unuseless. I argued that there is a difference between national brand identity and the geographic origin of a product, and that, if at all, we as\nconsumers owe loyalty to the products of companies that provide a livelihood to our people.\nForeign companies—including many represented here tonight—employ more than 170,000 people in Georgia. Your companies and your products are bedrock contributors to\nthe national and southeastern economy.\nThank you.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart’s biography • Speakers Bureau • Speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nToo Soon to Breathe Easy\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nJacksonville Regional Chamber of Commerce\nJune 2, 2008\nThank you, Lee [Thomas], for that introduction, and thank you, too, for your service as a board member of the Atlanta Fed. Lee is in his second term\nas a board member and brings wise counsel to the table each time we meet.\nI'm grateful to Lee and everyone associated with the Jacksonville Regional Chamber of Commerce. Your hospitality has been great. I appreciate the\nopportunity to speak to the city's business leadership at a juncture in the country's economic life that presents difficult trade-offs and serious\nchallenges.\nThe last few weeks have had the feel—for me personally and I think many in the business and financial community—of coming up for air. Since the\nemergence and spread of financial turmoil starting last August, our economy has been confronting one challenge after another. These challenges\ninclude financial market illiquidity and significant losses by banks and financial institutions, a deep decline in housing sector activity and falling home\nprices, rapid onset of general economic weakness, and inflation pressures resulting in part from rising energy prices.\nAlthough conditions have improved on some fronts, I don't feel we can yet \"breathe easy.\" The path of the economy is still enveloped in considerable uncertainty, and serious\nrisks remain.\nIn my remarks this afternoon, I will share my perspective on the current state of the national economy, the outlook through the remainder of the year and into 2009, and the\nrisks to that outlook. I want to close by offering some comments on longer-term concerns that may encroach on prospects for sustained financial stability and general\nprosperity. I'll add at the outset that these views are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nGlobal context\nThe global context is important, and I know you agree with this view here in Jacksonville given the port's role in import and export trade.\nDuring the first quarter, major U.S. trading partners in Europe, emerging Asia, and Japan reported stronger than anticipated gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) projects global GDP growth in 2008 to be 3.7 percent on an annualized basis—a very solid number but about 1.25 percent lower than the\ngrowth recorded last year. With this growth, many economies also have experienced rising inflation, which is a concern for central banks around the world.\nFor the next several minutes, I will present a verbal storyboard of the economy's recent past, present, and near-term future. I would argue that Jacksonville—with its role in\ninternational trade and business services, particularly financial transaction services—is highly invested in some of the key subplots of our current economic narrative.\nOver the last few months, the national economy has seen developing challenges on three fronts: growth, inflation, and financial stability. In the last several weeks, financial\nmarkets have become somewhat more stable.\nGrowth story\nI would characterize the current position of the overall economy as growing slowly, poised for gradual recovery, but carrying real risks that could subvert the story. Since last\nfall, we've suffered a pronounced economic slowdown, with positive but low growth numbers. The early estimate of first quarter growth of 0.6 percent was revised upward last\nweek to 0.9 percent. This performance followed growth of 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007.\nConsumer activity accounts for about two-thirds of the economy's output. In the first quarter, year-over-year growth of consumer spending slowed to just 1 percent—the\nslowest pace since 2001. And consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan's index, has reached the lowest level since 1980.\nProspects of a weak economy caused business investment to slow over the last two quarters. Businesses seemed to have become more cautious in capital outlays, with\ndiscretionary investment often postponed. Total nonresidential fixed investment, which includes spending on equipment and software as well as on nonresidential structures,\nwas flat in the first quarter.\nIndustrial production growth has deteriorated in recent months. For instance, production of automotive products declined more than 14 percent in April from a year earlier.\nParenthetically, I understand that soft U.S. demand for autos has dampened import traffic at the Jacksonville port. Completing the picture, exports have provided some\ncounterweight to negative trends in our manufacturing economy. In the first quarter of the year, exports of goods increased by an estimated 2.8 percent.\nThe service sector—which is, as I said earlier, very important to Jacksonville's economy—has also not evaded the current economic slowdown, especially in segments\ndirectly connected to real estate. Recent readings of the health of this sector are mixed. Looking at the sector through the prism of employment, there has been job growth in\nhealth care, education, and tourism. In contrast, we've seen job losses in financial services and wholesale and retail trade.\nEmployment trends are a crucial indicator of overall economic health. The storyline for employment up to this point has been weakness but not a collapse. Nonfarm payroll\nemployment declined for the fourth consecutive month in April, and the unemployment rate stands at 5 percent compared with 4.4 percent early in 2007. However, the most\nrecent employment report was not as bad as expected with a modest loss of 20,000 jobs. Also, initial claims for unemployment insurance have not moved higher in recent\nweeks. We'll get another update on the jobs situation later this week.\n\n\fDrags on the economy\nWe're experiencing some powerful drags on economic growth. Among them is the weak housing sector. Prices for existing homes nationwide in the first quarter declined\nmore than 14 percent from just a year earlier, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index. Realtor data show the median price for existing homes sold in\nJacksonville declined 6.7 percent during the first quarter of 2008 compared with a year earlier. Nationally, inventories of new and existing homes for sale remain high at more\nthan 10 months' supply at the current pace of sales. As a comparison, the average for the past decade was around four months' supply.\nIn Jacksonville and the rest of the nation, new home construction has declined to low levels—a necessary adjustment to reduce inventories. Nationally, new home sales were\ndown 42 percent in April relative to a year earlier, but the sales rate actually ticked up by 3.3 percent during the month. In addition, existing home sales have been relatively\nstable in recent months. Our careful assessment of the incoming data on housing suggests a storyline of a slowing pace of continuing decline.\nA second factor weighing down growth has been energy costs. Crude oil prices have increased more than 30 percent since January 1 to the present range of $125–$130 per\nbarrel. With higher transportation and other energy costs, consumers have less money to allocate for other types of spending.\nAnother drag on growth has been tighter credit standards. In the Federal Reserve's most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, most domestic banks reported they had\ntightened standards on residential mortgages and some other classes of consumer loans. Also, a majority of lenders said they had tightened standards on commercial and\nindustrial loans to large and middle market firms.\nBank credit is part of the larger story of the financial markets. Here the storyline is more settled but still fragile. From the exceedingly difficult conditions of mid-March (the\ntime of the Bear Stearns action), credit markets have stabilized somewhat, liquidity has improved, and credit spreads have come down. For example, the AAA corporate\nbond spread over 10-year Treasuries stood last week at 165 basis points, down from more than 200 in March.\nInflation situation\nLet me round out my storyboard of the current economy with a discussion of inflation. The inflation storyline so far has been uncomfortable levels with hints of rising\nexpectations. We gauge inflation conditions in the economy in a number of ways. There are two principal consumer price indices—the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the\nPersonal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index. Both indices reflect price movements in hundreds of goods and services and are computed monthly at the so-called\n\"headline\" level (with everything included) and as a \"core\" measure, which excludes energy and food.\nCore measures are considered useful in reducing monthly noise in the data to get a sense of the longer-term inflation trend. Some economics shops—including the\nCleveland and Dallas Federal Reserve Banks—trim off the outlier components of the basket of goods and services each month to get another assessment of the\nfundamental picture.\nThe headline CPI and PCE inflation measures have behaved similarly in recent months and have been quite volatile, reflecting the sharp swings in food and energy prices.\nThe headline CPI was up 3.9 percent over last year in April—down a bit from March's reading but still elevated relative to the benign inflation experience of much of the last\ndecade.\nCore CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, has hovered at above 2 percent for the last few months and has displayed no clear trend. However, the most\nrecent Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland trimmed mean CPI index came in at 2.8 percent in April and appears to have drifted higher in recent months. If we take a longerterm view, the inflation picture also is disconcerting. The three-year average headline CPI inflation is at the highest level since the early 1990s.\nWith inflation elevated, I'm attentively monitoring measures of inflation expectations. Measures of consumer attitudes show that year-ahead inflation expectations have\nmoved higher. However, survey questions about the longer term revealed more moderate attitudes, suggesting that inflation expectations have not indisputably ratcheted up.\nAn explanation of the short-term upward movement is that rising inflation expectations are commonly associated with rising energy prices.\nSo, to summarize the storyline for the current state of the U.S. economy, we have a slow-growth economy poised for gradual recovery, weak but not collapsing labor markets,\na slowing pace of decline of housing, more settled but still fragile financial markets, and uncomfortable levels of inflation with hints of rising inflation expectations.\nThe outlook\nLet me now turn to the outlook. My storyline looking ahead is not so severe a slowdown, but not so quick a recovery. As already mentioned, the first quarter of 2008 delivered\nGDP growth of just under 1 percent. I believe the second quarter may be somewhat better than some earlier dire forecasts. The federal government's economic stimulus\nshould provide some boost to household spending in the second and third quarters. On balance, I'm expecting a weak first half followed by some improvement in the second\nhalf as the drags on growth I mentioned earlier gradually diminish.\nMy base case for inflation assumes a fall-off from the current elevated level of inflation supported by some moderation of energy and food price increases. I also expect soft\neconomic growth to constrain the ability of businesses to pass through energy and other costs and raise prices in the coming months.\nOil prices so far this year have risen more than I anticipated as energy supply has lagged behind demand growth. My outlook assumes that energy costs do not continue to\nclimb much further, which is an uncertain proposition. Also, I'm assuming that financial market conditions continue to stabilize and that housing sector conditions do not\ndeteriorate dramatically.\nWe remain in a period of considerable uncertainty. There are very real risks to this outlook. I will cite three.\nThe first is renewed financial instability. As I said, markets remain fragile. A new spell of instability could follow, for instance, from the seizing up of a systemically important\ncredit market.\nThe second risk is an oil price shock in the face of growing global demand. Recent indications are that the high price of gasoline and other energy products is blunting\ndemand in the United States. But demand continues to rise in emerging economies, most notably China.\nThe third is a persistent and even steeper decline of house prices. Some analysts have pointed to the risk of an adverse feedback loop—a self-reinforcing spiral. In this line\nof thinking, buyers would hold off home purchases in hopes of lower prices, banks would refuse to finance purchases on the basis of questionable and falling appraisals, and\nprices would continue to be marked down in hopes of attracting buyers.\n\n\fLong-term challenges\nBeyond the immediate challenges of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, I'd like to draw attention to certain persistent structural imbalances that present serious\nrisks to our nation's long-term and continuing economic well-being. In coming years these imbalances, if not addressed, will loom like geologic faults threatening severe\neconomic and financial disruption and potentially requiring wrenching adjustments. Surely a lesson of the last several months is that excesses and imbalances can trigger\nsurprising, destructive dynamics with elements of contagion and fear.\nWe face current and future imbalances in the form of structural trade deficits, foreign petroleum dependency, and fiscal deficits. The trade deficit is rooted in the feeble\nsavings practices of our population along with stubborn dependence on imported oil. The growth of entitlement obligations beginning in the next decade constitutes a fiscal\nchallenge of unprecedented magnitude. These concerns deserve high rank on the country's economic agenda.\nI'm hoping breathing will come more easily as the year plays out, as we enter 2009 and as immediate challenges subside. But recent experience tells me we won't be fully at\nease until a sustainable trade, energy, and fiscal balance has been achieved.\nThank you.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Podcasts • Speakers Bureau\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nThe Southern Center for International Studies Young Professionals\nAtlanta, Ga.\nMay 17, 2008\nThank you for that introduction. I'm pleased to kick off your conference on Globalization and Emerging Economies. You have chosen a very timely\nsubject with which I've had some direct experience.\nMy direct experience includes commercial banking in the Middle East in the 1970s, country debt restructuring in the 1980s, and small and mediumsized enterprise finance in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe in the 1990s. I've also worked in private equity finance in all these regions in\nthe early part of this decade.\nAs I survey the room this morning, I think I can safely assume most of you are young professionals in business, finance, and law. I can also\nassume, I think, that you are doing business today or are interested in doing business with emerging markets in the form of trade of goods or\nservices, investments (both outbound from the United States and inbound from these countries), or transaction services in support of these. So,\nalthough you are early in your careers, I am assuming you are well traveled, relatively knowledgeable, and somewhat experienced in emerging\neconomies. Or some of you may just like to get up early on a Saturday morning.\nIf my assumptions are accurate, the most useful thing I can do this morning is to provide a backdrop to frame the big questions as a context for your narrower and more\nspecific discussions later in the day. Let me add that the views I express are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nTerminology too simplistic—not a two-class world\nGiven all the possibilities, the conference organizers were wise in using the term \"emerging economies\" instead of \"emerging markets\" or the narrower \"pioneer markets.\"\n\"Emerging economies\" is the most general and inclusive term, but I must confess some frustration with much of the jargon used to describe today's global commercial\nlandscape. Emerging economies or emerging markets cover about 170 sovereign states and an extraordinarily wide spectrum of countries. In these countries, market size,\nrelative economic development, and on-the-ground conditions vary widely.\nThe term emerging markets has been in use for a decade or more and has coincided with the growth of cross-border equity finance. Over my career, we've migrated through\nthe terms \"third world\" to \"less developed countries\" (or LDCs) to \"developing countries\" to emerging markets. None of these is quite satisfactory.\nOne way to group countries is OECD and non-OECD. OECD stands for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and includes 30 countries, mostly in\nNorth America, Europe, and the Pacific Rim. Mexico and Turkey—two countries historically thought of as emerging—are OECD countries. Nonetheless, the demarcation is\nuseful. The broad category of emerging economies or markets is all non-OECD countries.\nAlso, with the shift of so much manufacturing to so-called emerging economies, referring to established European and North American economies as \"industrialized\" seems\nout of date. Indeed, a characteristic of advanced economies today is a developed service sector, especially financial services. Manufacturing in advanced economies is\nincreasingly an assembly of components from industrialized non-OECD countries.\nFour non-OECD countries that have attracted much attention recently are Brazil, Russia, India, and China—the so-called BRIC economies. Jim O'Neill, chief global\neconomist at Goldman Sachs, coined the acronym in 2001 and argued that the global economic story of the first half of this century may be the story of the BRICs. Since that\ntime equity markets have risen by about 420 percent in Brazil and India, more than 120 percent in China, and nearly 840 percent in Russia.\nFrom 2001 through early 2007, I taught courses on international business strategy at Georgetown University and Johns Hopkins. At that time, I argued that virtually every\ncompany—regardless of geographic scope—needed a China (and later, an India) strategy. My point was the necessity to consider these countries' effect on product\nsourcing, cost structures, service value chains, and ultimately competition—even between purely domestic rivals.\nIt's worth pointing out, however, that fixation on BRIC economies excludes many other significant countries, some of which you will discuss today. These include Colombia\nand Chile in South America, South Africa and Nigeria in Africa, and Vietnam and Indonesia in Asia.\nMy point is that the reality of the world is much more a spectrum than a two-class world of neat distinctions. Indeed, most emerging economies have a modern sector within a\nsociety that has somewhat wider income disparity than our own, somewhat less developed infrastructure, and somewhat less mature institutions and rule of law.\nConventional thinking reversed\nLet me turn to some points of greater import than complaints about terminology.\nMuch conventional thinking about emerging market economies has been turned upside down in recent years. The conventional view held that an emerging economy was not\nhighly industrialized, and that it was commodity export-dependent, capital poor, and technology deficient. Today's reality is not so simple.\nI would like to comment on three current or developing realities about emerging economies that require us to update our thinking. First is the debate on economic decoupling,\nwhich is the notion of reduced correlation between the United States and certain emerging economies. Second, I'll talk about the changing dynamics of capital flows between\npoorer and richer countries. Third, I will share some thoughts on sovereign wealth funds, which are an increasing force in cross-border investments.\n\n\fBefore looking at these developments, I would like to provide the context of the U.S. and global economic situation and outlook.\nEconomic situation and outlook\nThe U.S. economy is in the midst of a pronounced slowdown, with very little growth recorded for two consecutive quarters. The weakness was initially centered in the\nhousing sector but has become more widespread.\nConsumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP. Personal consumption has softened. It has been argued that to the extent the\nworld relies on strong U.S. consumer activity, this weakness could pose a threat to continued global expansion (hence, the debate on decoupling).\nAlso, the United States has experienced elevated inflation levels partially driven by a run-up of energy and other commodity prices. The U.S. dollar has depreciated against\nthe euro and on a trade-weighted basis. The export sector of the U.S. economy has benefited and remains quite strong. Export growth has diluted—but not offset—the\nnegative trend of the U.S. economy.\nGlobal economic growth has begun to slow after several years of very strong performance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects global GDP growth in 2008 to be\n3.7 percent on an annualized basis—a very solid number but about 1.25 percent lower than the growth recorded last year. The United States constitutes about 25 percent of\nthe global economy, and most forecasters expect slow growth for 2008. The IMF's World Economic Outlook from April forecasts the eurozone to grow 1.4 percent. In most\nemerging economies, real GDP growth appears to be softening but still growing nicely coming off the very strong pace of growth earlier this decade. The larger emerging\neconomies should continue to grow enough to keep upward pressure on oil and other commodity prices.\nPrice inflation in the past few years has been remarkably controlled in most economies. But recently inflation in many parts of the world has begun to pick up. I'm sure you're\naware of reports of food price–related social unrest in several countries. Inflation is a growing issue for emerging economies.\nThe decoupling debate\nIt used to be said that when the United States sneezes, the world catches pneumonia. A better metaphor for today would be that when the United States gets a cold, the\nworld gets a cough and the sniffles. Questions about decoupling are frequently heard in economic discourse, and they include the following:\nWill the U.S. downturn drag the rest of the world down, especially China and other consumer product exporters?\nIs the rest of the world positioned to withstand a negative demand shock of some duration from the United States?\nIs global growth being driven by increasingly mature, independent, and sustainable sources of economic dynamism?\nDo the larger economies—BRICs included—have tools to stimulate countercyclical activity in the face of weakness on the part of the United States?\nI won't discuss these questions in detail, but let me make a few observations. In the narrow sense, the decoupling debate has been about whether slower spending in the\nUnited States will lead to slower GDP growth in countries dependent on U.S. import demand. This concern is then broadened to a global slowdown or recession.\nMy view is the following: Global economic integration has progressed in recent years to the point that a slowdown in the United States will unquestionably be felt, but not as\nseverely as imagined by some. Domestic growth momentum in many emerging economies will attenuate the influence of U.S. weakness. And the accumulation of foreign\ncurrency reserves by these countries—the result of trade surpluses—provides an accessible resource to stimulate their own domestic growth to offset weaker exports, should\nthat weakness materialize.\nCapital flows and currency reserves\nThat brings me to the second issue I want to discuss, which concerns capital flows and foreign currency reserves accumulation. In the textbook version, capital—both\nphysical and financial—is supposed to flow from mature economies where returns are low to developing countries where the fruit hangs low and risk-adjusted returns are\nhigh.\nIn the last few years, many emerging economies—in spite of very robust growth rates—have been accumulating foreign currency surpluses derived mostly from export\nearnings and inbound investment. China's official foreign currency reserves approach $1.7 trillion. India's reserves are about $313 billion. Estimated reserves for Brazil are\n$196 billion and for Russia, $534 billion.\nThese surpluses must be invested, and since the reserves are in dollars and other hard currencies, they are mostly invested in U.S. and European financial assets.\nIs this a case of the poor financing the rich? How can this happen? At a high level, we can say that the earning (and investment attraction) power of emerging economies\nexceeds their absorption capacity in terms of both investment and consumption. In other words, they're on a roll and can't spend it all. There are many causes of this\nphenomenon. I'll highlight four:\ndeeply seated savings instincts on the part of the population in emerging nations combined with immature pension programs and official policies to discourage consumption;\nrestrictions on foreign investment by companies and individuals;\nunderdeveloped domestic banking systems and financial markets; and\nthe propensity of households in the United States to undersave and overspend.\nIn my view, we can expect these \"upstream\" capital flows to continue for some time.\nSovereign wealth funds\nThe flow of capital from emerging to developed economies is becoming institutionalized and encouraging the emergence of sovereign wealth funds. China, Russia, Abu\nDhabi, Saudi Arabia, and several other non-OECD countries have established government-controlled asset management firms to professionally manage their \"excess\"\nreserves. All of these countries appear to be planning for surpluses well into the future.\nThese sovereign wealth funds are in the process of diversifying some portion of their total holdings in pursuit of better returns. Diversification has occurred both within a\ncurrency—the dollar—and across currencies and geographic exposures. Diversification within the dollar, for instance, may involve purchase of nongovernment, higher-risk\nbonds and corporate equity securities as well as direct significant minority equity investments in banks and corporations. In addition, these funds will likely invest as limited\npartners in private equity and hedge funds managed by professional money managers here in the United States.\n\n\fThese pools of capital have become a major force in the world. Some sovereign wealth funds have played prominent roles in the recapitalization of U.S. and European banks\nthat incurred losses in the recent financial turmoil.\nA movement has developed to require sovereign wealth funds to adopt a code of conduct. I believe this development is healthy, if only to improve transparency and to\ndampen alarmist sentiment in the West.\nThere has been a fair amount of handwringing recently about sovereign wealth funds accumulating U.S. assets. I believe our posture has to be realistic—one country's trade\ndeficit (ours, in this case) is another country's investment surplus.\nThe increasing flow of cross-border investments helps to make the global economy even more integrated and gives emerging economies a shared stake in the success of\nthe U.S. economy.\nGood news for the world\nAnd that brings me to my final point: The growth and rising prosperity of the emerging economies and their financial coupling with advanced economies—especially the\nUnited States—is good news for the world. Financial integration with successful emerging economies should ultimately make our own economic path less precarious. This\nprocess is ongoing. Beyond recent and immediate cyclical patterns of the U.S. economy, policymakers must address persistent imbalances in trade accounts and energy\ndependence. Add to these projected fiscal deficits related to baby boomer entitlements. Confronting these imbalances will be a key policy challenge going forward.\nI applaud you for your global perspective, for caring about the fate of emerging economies, and for seeking opportunity there. I wish you the best with your conference, and I\nwould be glad to take a few of your questions.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart’s biography • International Monetary Fund • Southern Center for International Studies Young Professionals • Speaker’s bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nCurrent Economic Situation, Outlook, and Recent Actions\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nThe Rotary Club of Chattanooga\nChattanooga, Tenn.\nMarch 27, 2008\nI'm delighted to be in Chattanooga today as your speaker. As you know, things have been quite busy lately at the Federal Reserve. There's a lot I\ncould talk about this afternoon, but I'd like to focus on what I believe is top of mind for the members of your distinguished group.\nDuring my remarks, I'd like to talk about the economy, recent Fed actions, and the economic outlook. I'll close with a few thoughts on guiding\nfundamentals for policy in these challenging economic times. My views are mine alone and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nIn the past few weeks, many have asked if the economy is in recession. We don't yet have enough evidence to answer according to the technical\ndefinition by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is charged with making that determination by looking at a host of economic\nindicators. Also, we have not yet recorded two straight quarters (or even one) of real contraction (negative gross domestic product growth), which is\nthe popular definition of recession. In fact, the most recent quarter remained positive.\nThat said, it's clear the economy is in a slowdown that resembles past periods that were the leading edge of a recession. Economic growth has been slowing since the third\nquarter of last year coming off solid growth rates in the second and third quarters of 2007. Following a sluggish fourth quarter, I expect that GDP for the first quarter of this\nyear will show little, if any, growth.\nAlso, personal income growth has been flat, and there has been significant softening of employment, manufacturing activity, and sales at the retail and wholesale levels.\nIndeed, some areas such as employment actually have been contracting. Job growth in recent months was negative, and the unemployment rate has moved up to 4.8\npercent, compared with 4.5 percent last summer.\nIt's possible—given certain strengths such as strong business balance sheets and export growth—that the economy will not pass the threshold into a technical recession. In\nconsidering the current economic situation, I believe that an important policy objective at this juncture is to ensure that this slowdown is short and shallow.\nA critical factor—possibly the critical factor—in the determination of the length and depth of the current slowdown is the performance of the housing sector.\nNationally, house prices declined by 10.7 percent from January 2008 compared with a year earlier, according to the most recent S&P Case-Schiller home composite price\nindex evaluating 20 major metropolitan areas. Of course, local results may differ. Chattanooga area home prices, for instance, last year were still rising—but at a slower rate.\nOn average across the country, though, home prices have declined, in some markets substantially.\nThe number of housing starts and new home sales has fallen and are at less than half their respective peaks. Unfortunately, cutbacks in construction have made only a small\ndent in builders' elevated supply of unsold new homes—now at around 10 months' supply at the current pace of sales and up from the average for the past decade of around\nfour months.\nHousing weakness has weighed on growth in other sectors. For instance, the retail segment of the commercial real estate sector has weakened, according to anecdotal\ninformation. As we know, retail development tends to follow rooftops.\nAlso, problems with subprime mortgages have led to tighter credit conditions that have restricted mortgage financing, placing further downward pressure on housing activity.\nWith regard to financial conditions more broadly, markets have not yet stabilized. Although financial instability originated in the residential mortgage-backed securities market,\nit has spread to affect a variety of credit markets via market linkages or institutional interdependencies. The experience has been traumatic, at times generating primal\nemotions. Market volatility has been driven by fear, distrust, and flight to safety. I emphasize this point because financial system stability is a central focus of Fed policy at the\nmoment.\nAt the same time, inflation has become a more prominent concern. Price pressures have been most obvious in energy and commodities, including commodities in the food\nchain. High and rising inflation—if allowed to persist—can distort household and business behavior.\nBoth headline and core inflation measures have been elevated in recent months and above a level I would consider in the long run to be consistent with an objective of price\nstability.\nEven when inflation abates, shifts in relative prices of goods such as increases in energy costs—if sustained—can cause painful dislocations that force households to adjust\nliving patterns and companies to change their practices and even business models.\nFed actions\nToday, the U.S. economy faces challenges on three fronts: one, weakening growth; two, unstable financial markets; and three, elevated inflation and heightened uncertainty\nabout the inflation outlook.\n\n\fTo address these issues, the Fed has two basic sets of tools. At the macroeconomic level there is traditional monetary policy, and at the level of specific financial markets\nthere are various liquidity measures.\nChanging the federal funds rate target, which is the main monetary policy tool, supports macroeconomic goals—sustainable economic growth and stable prices. This tool\nchanges the overnight interbank price for money.\nIn recent months the Fed has repeatedly lowered the fed funds rate, which was 5.25 percent last September. At our most recent meeting March 18, the Fed cut the federal\nfunds rate target by 75 basis points to 2.25 percent. This action was taken in response to the weakening outlook caused by tightening credit conditions and the deepening of\nthe housing contraction.\nChanges in the federal funds rate can influence but not dictate other interest rates in credit markets. There is not a one-to-one correspondence between changes in the fed\nfunds rate and longer-term interest rates for borrower classes critical to the economy. For instance, while the fed funds rate has declined 300 basis points in the past seven\nmonths, the rate for conventional 30-year mortgages has declined about 65 basis points, and the yield on AAA corporate bonds has declined only 41 basis points.\nIn addition, the ability of reductions in the federal funds rate to address liquidity strains in credit markets has proven to be limited.\nA continuation of these liquidity strains presents a serious potential risk to the financial system. As a result, the Fed in recent months has undertaken additional steps to\ndirectly improve liquidity conditions in key credit markets.\nFederal funds rate changes determine the size of the Fed's balance sheet—the foundation of the money supply. The Fed's liquidity tools work primarily by changing the\ncomposition of the asset side of the Fed's balance sheet. For example, by temporarily exchanging some currently illiquid assets for other more liquid assets, the central bank\ncan mitigate some of the pressures that have prevented credit markets from functioning smoothly.\nA listing of recent liquidity actions can sound like an alphabet soup—the TAF, or Term Auction Facility, announced December 12; the TSLF, or Term Securities Lending\nFacility, announced on March 11; and most recently, the PDCF, or Primary Dealer Credit Facility, announced March 16 to allow certain nonbank financial institutions to borrow\nfrom the Fed.\nEach of these measures are simply extensions of the traditional tools of the Fed—the discount window and open market operations. Collectively, the four major liquidityoriented programs had the following elements—a lengthening of term of lending, broader types of collateral, a wider set of counterparties, and a lower premium for the\nprimary credit rate, which is the rate at which the Fed lends directly to banks through the discount window.\nThese Fed liquidity actions can be likened to a surgeon's instruments—designed to get at precisely the problem at hand—and no more.\nAlso, the Fed's liquidity actions can be viewed as a complement to monetary policy, a point that was made in the FOMC's statement following its March 18 meeting: \"Today's\npolicy action, combined with those taken earlier, including measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to\neconomic activity.\"\nA week ago Sunday, the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase was announced. Earlier this week, the deal was changed from the original $2 per share to $10 per\nshare, and certain specifics were adjusted. To facilitate this transaction, the New York Fed—through a limited liability company formed for this purpose—will take control of a\nportfolio of assets valued at $30 billion as of March 14. JPMorgan Chase will bear the first $1 billion of any realized losses in this portfolio, and any gains will accrue to the\nNew York Fed. The arrangement was undertaken with the support of the U.S. Treasury.\nThis action was taken to bolster market liquidity and promote orderly functioning of short-term funding and credit risk markets.\nAs I said earlier, financial stability must be a central concern at this time. The Fed has taken strong measures to avoid potential damage to the broad economy.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead, my forecast has been affected both by an economic slowdown that has been sharper than I had expected and the recurring spells of financial market turmoil.\nA few months ago our forecast at the Atlanta Fed saw growth slow in the first half of 2008, then pick up in the second half of the year. But it now appears to me that the\ncontraction in housing and the dampening effects of financial turmoil on household and business spending could persist through the remainder of this year. The recovery in\ngrowth I had expected in the second half of this year may be delayed.\nThe tax rebates should provide some stimulus in the second and early third quarters of this year. But given the uncertain atmosphere I expect will continue to prevail in May\nand June, I do not expect full flow through of the rebates into personal consumption expenditures.\nI expect it will take much of the rest of the year for house prices to bottom out and financial markets to restore the necessary preconditions of stability—that is, confidence in\nasset values and confidence in transaction counterparties.\nLooking ahead further to 2009, my outlook becomes more optimistic. It will take longer than I earlier expected to return to solid growth, but by the fourth quarter of 2008 the\nconditions should be in place to support a return to healthy growth next year.\nWith regard to the inflation outlook, I've learned not to be dismissive of inflation risks in this era of surging global demand for commodities. But my expectations are in accord\nwith the FOMC statement of March 18 that inflation should moderate in coming quarters. This moderation reflects a projected leveling out of energy and other commodity\nprice increases and the impact of generally weaker demand conditions in the economy. In any event, it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments\ncarefully.\nGuiding fundamentals\nAs I said earlier, the U.S. economy faces challenges on three fronts: growth, inflation, and financial stability. I'd like to close by grounding my remarks in what I believe are\nsome guiding fundamentals appropriate for this challenging period.\n\n\fIntegral to the Fed's dual mandate of maximum sustainable economic growth and stable prices is the goal of financial stability. Orderly markets and the flow of credit to\nbusinesses and households are necessary for the sustained prosperity of all sectors of the economy—not just Wall Street. My view of recent Fed interventions is that they\nare an attempt to help preserve or restore normal market functioning.\nI am aware there are risks inherent in these actions. The line that separates restoring market function from merely redistributing losses and gains is not a bright one. This is\nthe reason that policymakers only rarely and reluctantly intervene in markets.\nAlso, the distinction between liquidity problems and insolvency is not a trivial one when monetary authorities respond to troubles of market players. The critical evaluation is\nthe systemic risk posed by the failure of an institution.\nSome believe the Fed has overreacted. Others have said the central bank has been slow to respond to building problems. And still others have warned that the Fed has\ncrossed lines that define appropriate function.\nBut from where I stand, Fed actions were taken with a prudent acknowledgement of the unintended consequences that may accompany almost all policy interventions. The\nactions taken by the Federal Reserve over the past several months were taken in perilous and fast-moving circumstances. Given the likelihood of continued financial and\neconomic uncertainty, the public authorities charged with achieving and maintaining financial stability must preserve the capacity to act decisively in the best interest of the\neconomy as a whole. I believe the Fed has done that.

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThoughts on the Subprime Mortgage Crisis\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nThe Atlanta Commerce Club\nPanel Discussion Titled \"The Subprime Crisis: Is It Contagious?\"\nFebruary 29, 2008\nThank you for inviting me to join this panel discussion on the subprime crisis and the contagion concern.\nOne of the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve is the promotion and preservation of financial stability. The possibility of contagion, or the\nspreading of volatility and illiquidity from one market to another, is one threat to financial stability. With this background, I would like to offer brief\ncomments on three questions related to the past, present, and future of the subprime/financial markets story.\nThe first question is: How did problems in the relatively small asset class of subprime mortgage–backed securities morph into a much broader\nfinancial (system) stability problem? Second, as of today, what is the broad state of risk to financial stability and more broadly the overall economy?\nThird, what will it take to return to stable conditions in the affected financial markets?\nFirst question—how did it happen?\nLet me begin by trying to place the subprime market in quantitative context. Although problems with the subprime market have caused widespread concern, the actual size of\nthe subprime mortgage-backed securities market is relatively small. Based on our estimates, the size of the subprime market is more than $1 trillion, which was around 3\npercent of the approximately $30 trillion of domestic nonfinancial debt last summer.\nSince that time, this relatively small asset class has been the biggest factor—but by no means the only factor—contributing to unstable conditions in a broad array of credit\n(or debt) markets. There have been two phenomena at work, in my view. First, some markets—for example, the asset-backed commercial paper market—are closely linked\nto subprime. Other markets have been affected indirectly through a more general repricing of risk.\nTo understand how subprime mortgages could have triggered such major changes in financial markets, let's recall the credit environment of a few years ago. Credit losses\nhad been unusually low in many U.S. markets for an extended period of time. With the strength and relative stability of the U.S. macroeconomy and the strong performance\nof housing in many geographic markets, lenders projected low losses even on the riskiest of loans.\nThe decline in credit quality first became apparent in the subprime market. In many cases aggressive mortgage originators were writing loans to borrowers with weak credit\nhistory, little or no equity invested in the house, and little or no verification of the borrower's ability to repay. Under the assumption of ever-increasing housing prices,\nmortgages written on these low standards were valued as though they were low risk. Once housing prices stopped rising and began declining in some markets, the potential\nfor increases in subprime default rates and the increased riskiness of the mortgages became obvious to financial markets.\nSubprime losses began to contaminate structured instruments in which they were held such as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, that were assets of structured\ninvestment vehicles, or SIVs. What followed was a dramatic decline in liquidity in many markets.\nIn response to this generalized illiquidity, particularly in the interbank market, the Fed in coordination with other central banks in December implemented a term auction\nfacility.\nI would argue that root causes of problems in the subprime market brought into question some fundamental practices, incentives, and even institutions of other markets. By\nfundamentals, I mean the integrity of origination (that is, the quality of assets that went into securitization pools), the structure of the securities into which loans and individual\nsecurities were packaged, and the value of these securities as collateral for margin financing.\nAlso, rating agencies had greatly underestimated the risk of many mortgage-backed securities. This led to a loss in confidence in the ratings assigned to other complex\nfinancing structures with further reductions in liquidity and increases in the volatility of prices across a variety of debt markets.\nThrough this spread of suspicion, subprime losses exposed related problems elsewhere, such as the syndication market for leveraged loans. Some leveraged lending\nunderwriting was in its own way very aggressive in the period before the markets turned rocky starting last summer.\nFinally, the subprime crisis generated a thicket of doubts concerning counterparties. Uncertainty about valuations of securitized debt fed uncertainty regarding the exposure\nof large banks and other market participants, which led to concerns about executing trades with these counterparties.\nSecond question—what is today's risk to financial stability?\nI would characterize the current state of affected financial markets (those most affected by the subprime problem) as evolving positively but still fragile—in other words,\nunusually vulnerable to shocks. Affected markets are working through problems of counterparty mistrust, lower or no trading volume, reduced new origination, and\nplummeting market prices that may be well below eventual economic value. For instance, investors have been reluctant to roll over asset-backed commercial paper because\nof the linkages to subprime mortgage–backed securities purchased by structured investment vehicles, or SIVs. The asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market has\nshrunk over $400 billion since August of last year, and major investors have exited, possibly permanently.\nThe markets for municipal bonds in general and especially the markets for auction-rate municipal bonds are under stress because of their historic reliance on monoline credit\ninsurers to strengthen the credit of municipalities by adding their credit enhancement. The monoline insurers are exposed to CDOs with subprime positions.\n\n\fAdditionally, the decline in the value of housing is starting to create concern about other consumer loan and mortgage markets including the markets for credit cards, auto\nloans, student loans, and prime mortgages.\nIn this context, financial institutions, in the United States and abroad, recently have booked some large write-offs. Several have negotiated investments of new capital. But,\nthere's still widespread uncertainty about what might follow.\nThird question—what will it take to restore stability?\nLooking ahead, I believe resolution of the current financial market problems requires some stabilization of U.S. housing markets. At this time, it's difficult to determine when\nthat stability will materialize.\nA key prerequisite to financial stability is clarity of loan and security performance. In the latter half of 2007 and early weeks of 2008, writedowns of exposures to subprime\nsecurities, CDOs, and other instruments have reflected projections of future performance of underlying loans. As securities season with the passage of time, and as the\nreality of actual defaults and foreclosures is clarified, valuations should have a firmer basis.\nSecuritization of fundamentally sound loans has continued in recent months, but it's unlikely there will be a resurgence of new issue and secondary markets for riskier asset\nclasses such as subprime mortgages. With regard to other debt markets, the new issue and secondary markets will stabilize as soundly originated new product works\nthrough the pipeline. In time, I believe investors will regain confidence in both product and counterparties, and buying will resume for a broader range of asset classes.\nAlso, generally favorable economic conditions should help improve financial market stability. In recent quarters, economic growth has slowed considerably. The Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) lowered the federal funds rate from 5.25 percent last September to the current level of 3 percent. This reduction should encourage stronger\neconomic growth in the second half of 2008.\nIn closing, let me provide a succinct answer to this panel's central question, and that is, \"Is the subprime crisis contagious?\" In short, the answer is yes.\nThe subprime mortgage crisis has not been isolated but is part of a highly integrated, complex, and dynamic global financial system. Subprime market problems have not\nbeen limited to what is, as I said, a relatively small market because they raised questions about the fundamental institutional, incentive, and practices framework of several\nmodern markets.\nThank you for your attention.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Atlanta Fed Speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nCurrent Financial Stresses and Persistent Global Imbalances\nRemarks by Dennis P. Lockhart,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nSouthern Center for International Studies\nAtlanta, Ga.\nFebruary 8, 2008\nI'm delighted to speak at this event sponsored by the Southern Center for International Studies.\nIt's especially gratifying to me to be the speaker here today. Shortly after moving to Atlanta in 1978, I became aware of the Southern Center and\nbegan attending its programs. I recall—being the know-it-all I was in those days—being pretty aggressive with my questions of speakers. I made my\npresence felt enough to be invited ultimately onto the Southern Center board. And recently I've rejoined the board after a hiatus of 20 years. In\nremembering my questions, I couldn't imagine back then that the tables would be turned someday and I would be here fearing that some young\nknow-it-all will ask a tough question. After my remarks I will be happy to answer your merciful, untaxing questions. And I will oppose board\nmembership for anyone who violates that plea.\nToday, I want to focus most of my remarks on the interplay between the recent stresses and problems of our financial system—particularly the credit\ncapital markets—and the reality of persistent global financial imbalances. But let me begin with a very brief summary of a subject that is top of mind\nfor many of you in this room. And that subject is the current state of the economy and recent Federal Reserve actions.\nCurrent economic and market situation\nIn recent months, there has been a sharp deceleration of economic growth. The pace of job creation has slowed. And at 4.9 percent, unemployment is measurably higher\nthan it was a few months ago. When I joined the Atlanta Fed almost a year ago, the unemployment rate stood at 4.5 percent.\nTroubles in the housing sector have been well publicized, with house prices declining in many parts of the country. These developments have led many observers to express\nconcern that the economy is going into a recession. Also, with the surge in energy prices last year, recent measures of inflation have been elevated and above my personal\ncomfort zone as a policymaker.\nInterpretation of recent policy actions\nIn response to recent economic circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has acted decisively. Over a period of nine days, from January 22 to January\n30, the FOMC lowered the fed funds rate 125 basis points, from 4.25 to 3 percent. Since last August, the committee has dropped the fed funds rate 225 basis points.\nThese actions were taken to avert a deep and protracted economic downturn. In the face of economic weakening, the FOMC acted to avoid a restrictive posture and to move\nrates toward a level that might support a stronger pace of growth in the second half of 2008.\nYou may also be aware that in response to recent strains in financial markets the Fed has injected liquidity into the financial system. In December, the Fed introduced the\nTerm Auction Facility as another way to address immediate liquidity needs in financial markets.\nI believe recent actions helped address the risks to the economic forecast just referenced. My baseline forecast envisions weakness in the first half of 2008 followed by\nimprovement in the second half, with inflation moderating from recent levels. The liquidity injections and easing of monetary policy should help housing and financial markets\nstabilize and avoid an \"adverse feedback loop\" in which a decline in housing prices fuels financial market volatility with spillover to the broader economy.\nThese immediate, seemingly domestic, economic challenges demand attention. But I believe it's important to keep in mind the larger context—that our economy continues to\ndeal with the reality of persistent global imbalances. So I will take some time this afternoon to comment on the interplay between periods of financial system stress, the\nactions and policies required to remedy system weaknesses, and the reality of continuing global financial imbalances. Some of these thoughts are in the nature of a\nhypothesis. They are my tentative views and those of members of my economic research staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. I do not speak for the Federal Reserve\nSystem or my colleagues on the FOMC.\nTrends in credit markets\nTo set the stage for this discussion, let me review some of the key evolutionary trends in banking and credit over the last 20 years. The choice of 20 years of hindsight is\narbitrary, but I do remember strategic consideration of these directions in the mid-1980s—when I was a corporate banker working for Citicorp here in Atlanta.\nI will cite four trends I see as formative of our current situation.\nFirst, credit intermediation has evolved from being bank-centric to market-centric. To a substantial extent, the modern model of the banking business—at least for larger\nbanks—is that of originate-to-distribute. This means banks work with business clients and consumers to create a new loan but often sell that loan into a secondary market for\nsuch assets.\nSecond, the business of credit has evolved from the old style of booking a loan and holding it until repayment to the financial technology called securitization. This term refers\nto the pooling of many similar loans into a single package that is then funded in the debt securities market. Securitization has been one of the major financial innovations of\nthe last two decades. The master security is then broken into tranches with different risk and return characteristics.\nCharles Sanford, a native of Georgia who rose to head Bankers Trust, wrote of \"particle finance.\" As I recall, he envisioned particles of risk and reward. He meant that credit\nand financial risk would be parsed, tranched, and transformed into derivatives to match the exact risk and return preferences of diverse lenders and investors. Along with\n\n\fsecuritization, the growth of derivatives—financial contracts based on the price fluctuation of a distinct asset, commodity, or risk—has been a major innovation of our age.\nThird, for many banks, particularly our larger banks, lending to corporations has evolved from general corporate lending to leveraged lending. For some time it's been the\ncase that banks seldom make direct loans to the top-rated corporations, especially where the bond markets offer a better deal. The rise of the private equity industry offered a\nlending alternative with better fees and spreads. Financing leveraged buyout transactions has become a big business for many banks. And these loans too have been sold\noff into secondary markets.\nFourth, credit extended to American corporations and consumers has evolved from domestically funded to global distribution of securities and loans. There is little argument\nthat capital markets—including credit markets—have become global. To some extent, this is in response to the accumulation of large pools of dollar capital held offshore. I\nwant to explore this notion further in my remarks.\nRole of foreign dollar surpluses\nAnalysis of the causes of current financial market instability cannot ignore the possible role played by the interconnected phenomena of trade imbalances, savings and\ninvestment imbalances, fiscal imbalances, and foreign-owned dollar surpluses. Such imbalances have emerged as a persistent—and some would argue ominous—feature of\nthe global economy as the world's goods markets and capital markets have become ever more integrated.\nI believe it's important to recognize that this aspect of globalization is both effect and cause. The effect is that large, mature countries like the United States are able to be net\ndebtors to the rest of the world for sustained periods of time. But in addition, the channeling of capital from net saving countries is itself a cause of financial market, product,\nand deal innovation as bankers try to design investments that appeal to investors, including foreign investors. In my view, analysis of the causes of current financial market\ninstability cannot ignore the role of foreign dollar surpluses.\nLooking at economic history over the past few decades, it appears that the recycling of large dollar surpluses has presented recurring challenges. My career actually involved\ndirect dealing with both offshore dollar surpluses and the resulting challenges. In the early 1970s I worked in Saudi Arabia when the first momentous oil price change\noccurred. The world was flabbergasted when oil went from $2.50 a barrel to around $12 a barrel. The oil producing countries suddenly generated enormous—for that time—\ndollar surpluses that needed to be invested elsewhere in the world. There was a rush of lending to developing countries—especially Latin America—that seemed to offer so\nmuch growth potential and, in turn, high rates of return.\nBorrowing countries and their bankers overindulged, and this flow of capital resulted in the less-developed country, or LDC, debt crisis of the 1980s. At that time, I had the job\nfor a year of swapping bad loans to South American countries for equity in local companies.\nThe point of this commentary is that the accumulation and investment of large pools of dollar capital in the hands of institutions and individuals abroad may have direct\nlinkage to periodic financial market cycles in this country—both rises and falls—as well as banking system problems. This argument has recently been put forward by\nacademic economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. Reinhart (of the University of Maryland) and Rogoff (of Harvard) draw a line from the channeling of petrodollars\nto South American sovereign debt in the 1970s to disruptions of the U.S. banking system in the 1980s. Whereas the large foreign dollar holdings of the 1970s and 1980s\nwere channeled through banks to risky emerging market debt, in recent years the accumulation of dollar holdings abroad helped finance risky U.S. household debt, again\nwith banks in the middle.\nEach period of financial market systemic stress, regardless of root causes, is followed by the predictable period of sharp adjustments and reform of the financial markets and\ntheir institutional architecture. The interaction among all the factors I have mentioned—trade imbalances, global saving and investment imbalances, market innovation, and\nreform—is complex. It's tempting to carry analogies from the past too far. At this point conclusions about cause and effect are more speculation than science. But I am\npersuaded that the liquidity conditions created by foreign-owned dollar surpluses trying to find an investment home in this country contributed to markets' recent unstable\nconditions.\nI am also persuaded these financial imbalances are not likely to disappear in the foreseeable future. We must live with them, and policymakers must be mindful of them.\nWhy are financial imbalances likely to persist? One reason is that U.S. dependence on foreign energy resources will last some time. Another is that the conversion of largepopulation, surplus-generating, saver countries (such as China and Japan) to consumer societies will take time. So will the conversion of the United States to a saver society.\nIf you need be convinced of the scope of this transition, just consider the primacy of the U.S. consumer in world product markets. By one measure, nominal U.S. consumer\nspending was 18 percent of gross global product in 2007.\nThis nation will need foreign owned dollar capital well into the future. As we address the recently exposed inadequacies of our financial system and implement necessary\nfixes, we must not discourage foreign investors. What could do this? The answer is the same whether the recipient country is a small emerging market or the largest\neconomy in the world. Inward investment is discouraged by:\nseemingly arbitrary changes in legal and tax rules, including changes favoring local resident interests;\nconfiscatory treatment of property and assets, including financial assets;\nexcessive regulation;\ncapital controls; and\ninvestment protectionism.\nLet me elaborate on some of these factors. In my view, we should not rewrite the rules of the game after the fact. The efforts of private-sector players with the encouragement\nof the U.S. Treasury Department under the banner of the Hope Now initiative promote a voluntary framework for mitigating subprime mortgage foreclosures. I support this\napproach. It is far better for the parties in financial arrangements to work through the process of apportioning losses by mutual consent or through traditional adjudication\nchannels.\nIn my view, we should not—in pursuit of market order—impose excessive regulatory constraints that undermine the innovation and competitiveness that are, in the long run,\nthe foundation of thriving financial markets and institutions.\nFinally, in my view, we should not become identified with \"investment protectionism.\" Trade protectionism is widely understood and debated. Investment protectionism refers\nto differentiated treatment of capital providers based on national identity and citizenship as well as denial of certain investment opportunities to nonresidents or noncitizens.\n\n\fThere are some legitimate national security concerns in certain industries, such as defense, but such concerns can be easily exaggerated.\nMuch has been written and said recently on the latest concern—sovereign wealth funds. Sovereign wealth funds are special purpose investment vehicles sponsored and\noverseen by governments to allocate some of their foreign currency reserves (dollar surpluses) to a diversified portfolio of securities and direct investments. I have had some\ndirect experience with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East. I share the views expressed by a number of commentators—sober and sensible, in my view—who argue\nthat we should not misconstrue the intent of these investors and exaggerate their threat to our national welfare and security. I think it is far-fetched that investments would be\nmade for nefarious political purposes and that investment funds would—or could—somehow impose noncommercial decisions on investee companies. In my experience and\nobservation, these funds are serious, responsible, commercially minded, and professional stewards of their countries' wealth. I think concerns about sovereign wealth funds\ncan be overwrought. To the extent that trade and capital-account imbalances are the source of potential instability, the answer is to address the fundamental causes.\nThe opposite fear is abandonment by foreign investors of the dollar and the United States as an investment destination. We need not, in my opinion, fear a precipitous,\nwholesale withdrawal of foreign-owned capital. The most extreme versions of this scenario are simply not possible. Though some diversification of global capital will proceed\nfrom the natural reapportionment of economic power as economies and capital markets develop, the United States and its currency remain at the center of the world's trade\nand investment system. So long as we follow sensible policies, the cost to the global economy of materially altering these arrangements would be far too high.\nTo close, let me summarize the thesis presented here and add a few thoughts. The United States has experienced periodic episodes of financial system stress followed by\ncurative adjustment and reform. We are in such a period now. Large and persistent global financial imbalances are contributing factors. The accumulation of large dollar\nbalances owned by foreign parties must be recycled into investments. Large volumes, resulting from concentrated dollar holdings abroad, encourage financial innovation but\nalso excesses. There are excesses because popular investment products and strategies are pushed beyond prudent limits under the pressure of competition and linear\nassumptions.\nIf global imbalances are unlikely to disappear for some time, and we must live with them, then market practitioners and financial authorities must improve their ability to\nmonitor global investment flows and recognize incipient problems.\nAs I said earlier, there is a fair dose of conjecture in these ideas. They deserve further exploration and research. My colleagues and I at the Atlanta Fed intend to do this.\nThank you very much.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Atlanta Fed Speeches\nRELATED LINKS ON OTHER SITES: Southern Center for International Studies\n\n\f"

Lockhart,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAssociation for Corporate Growth Capital Connection Conference\nAtlanta, Ga.\nFebruary 7, 2008\nI'm honored to speak this morning at the Association for Corporate Growth's Capital Connection Conference.\nToday I want to focus most of my remarks on the future of credit markets, which have been affected by recent financial turbulence.

The recent experience with subprime lending has\nshaken credit markets. Market participants are making adjustments in the face of a weakening economic environment. By adjustments, I'm referring to a reduction and\nwritedown of exposures, deleveraging, changes in underwriting standards, and a revision of risk management policies and practices, among others. These adjustments have\nbeen painful, but necessary.\nWith so much uncertainty about the outcome of the ongoing financial turmoil I thought it would be helpful to share some of my thoughts on what's in store for credit markets\nonce the dust from the subprime fallout finally settles. Before entering the treacherous terrain of predictions, I must emphasize that the views I'll present are mine alone. I do\nnot speak for the Federal Reserve or my colleagues on the FOMC.\nTrends in credit markets\nTo gain some perspective on the question of the future of credit markets, I think it's useful to review some of the key evolutionary trends in banking and credit over the last 20\nyears. The choice of 20 years of hindsight is arbitrary, but I do remember discussion of these directions in the mid-1980s—when I was a corporate banker working for Citicorp\nhere in Atlanta.\nI will cite four trends I see as formative of our current context.\nFirst, credit intermediation has evolved from being bank-centric to market-centric. To a substantial extent, the modern model of the banking business—at least for the larger\nbanks—is that of originate to distribute. Larger bank balance sheets have become heavier in securities, particularly since the distinction between commercial and investment\nbanking has become blurred.\nSecond, the business of credit has evolved from one of on-balance-sheet whole loans to one involving substantially off-balance-sheet securitized loans. Securitization has\nbeen one of the major financial innovations of the last two decades. Charles Sanford, when he was heading Bankers Trust, wrote of \"particle finance.\" As I recall, he meant\nthat credit risk would be parsed, tranched, and transformed into derivatives to match the exact risk and return preferences of diverse lenders/investors. Along with\nsecuritization, the growth of derivatives—very recently including credit default swaps—has been a major innovation of our age.\nThird, for many banks, particularly our larger banks, lending to corporations has evolved from corporate lending to leveraged lending. We recognized back in the 1980s that\nloans to investment-grade corporations couldn't pay the cost of capital. The ascendance of the private equity industry offered a lending alternative with better fees and\n\n\fspreads. Financing sponsor-led buyout transactions has become a big business for many banks and nonbanks alike. Loans are originated for syndication as well as bridges\nto high-yield debt issuance and, in recent years, as raw material for collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs.\nFourth, credit to American corporations and consumers has evolved from domestically funded to global distribution of securities and loans. There is little argument that capital\nmarkets—including credit markets—have become global. To some extent, this is in response to the accumulation of large pools of dollar capital held offshore.\nThe long-term trends I have just described have a lot of momentum, but the recent turmoil has raised legitimate questions about the future of credit finance. In particular, four\nquestions seem appropriate about the continuing evolution of financial markets.\nAre banks going to make a comeback, regaining their old share of the credit intermediation market and reverting to on-balance-sheet lending?\nIs securitization dead or dying?\nAre we going to see a permanent shrinkage of the leveraged loan market with the attendant consequences for private equity?\nWill foreign investors flee U.S. credit markets?\nAs a practitioner in the credit industry for the better part of 30 years, I will offer some tentative, but I believe informed, views on these questions. With regard to the role of\nbanks in credit markets, there has been much discussion in recent years of the shrinking market share of banks and the emergence of a \"shadow banking system.\" I'm\nreferring, of course, to the universe of off-balance-sheet special purpose vehicles, nonbank loan origination and lending companies, commercial paper-financed conduits,\nhedge funds, and other entities.\nI think the recent turmoil has shown that, in fact, banks retained a central role in the originate-to-distribute credit intermediation model. Banks may not have held the complete\nrange of securities from risk bearing tranches to triple A, but they did—as it turns out—hold substantial super senior exposure, and they did create many of the conduits that\ndirectly owned the securities. Also they provided back-up liquidity to the conduits that served as intermediaries to the ultimate investors, and they often helped the ultimate\ninvestors finance their holdings of the securities. Moreover, when problems arose the markets turned to the banks to use their superior access to liquidity—both marketsourced and official—to provide funding. In securities markets where banks have recently substantially scaled back lending, we have seen decreased liquidity as some\ninvestors depended on bank-supplied leverage to obtain their target rates of return.\nWhile banks have taken hits in the recent turmoil, their central role has been reconfirmed and their inherent strengths accentuated. The scale and scope of our larger banks\nand their broad earnings power have cushioned the losses. And their franchise strength has aided recapitalization.\nWhile I see banks recovering, I see little chance that we will revert to the old approach of originate-to-hold-in-portfolio model. Market-based credit intermediation provides\nsubstantial gains from diversification and transparency that are not available in the old model. And I see little chance banks in their various forms won't remain the\ncornerstone institutions of our financial system.\nSecond, is securitization dead or dying? Here I think the answer is an unambiguous no. Securitization is not a new and untested financing tool. Rather, securitization has\nbeen around for decades providing fee income to originators, diversification benefits to lenders, and lower costs to borrowers. The logic of securitization—done prudently—is\ntoo compelling, and the market infrastructure is advanced. I have heard anecdotal comments to the effect that major investors have latent demand that will return to the\nmarkets once volatility has subsided.\nBut it's clear to me that participants in the securitization process must address certain weaknesses.\nAccusations have flown about irresponsible mortgage origination practices—that is, the lowering of standards or even fraudulent behavior of originators who carry minimal\nrisk in the ultimate performance of a loan. Actual practices no doubt covered a wide spectrum, but it's clear that there were problems, and, in my opinion, this perverse\nincentive must be addressed.\nIn reaction to troublesome opacity and complexity, I expect that financing structures will become less complicated. I don't believe investors will be willing to invest in\nstructures that would require their lawyers days to figure out cash flows in the event of problems. Simpler, more transparent securities will facilitate somewhat reduced\nreliance on agency credit ratings. Ratings will remain an important part of the process because all investors cannot be expected to do their own thorough due diligence on\nevery security. Rating agencies are already undertaking their own reforms, but ratings are unlikely to be as singularly dominant as they have been in some markets in recent\nyears. Moreover, investors and rating agencies will not soon forget the lessons of recent months in evaluating pool probabilities. Tail events can materialize and, given recent\nexperience, seem to do so with higher frequency than was contemplated by the models employed—models that were built for other purposes and products.\nThird, are we going to see a permanent shrinkage of the leveraged loan market with the attendant consequences for private equity? Clearly, some shrinkage—especially in\nthe large deal category—has happened already, but is it permanent? A year ago there was talk of a private equity \"golden age.\" Like the four-minute mile before Roger\nBannister, there were predictions of the $100 billion deal. Lender terms—with covenant-light structures and equity bridges—were collecting critical commentary.\nWhat a difference a year makes! I believe the private equity industry will continue to operate, but at more modest levels of deal size, leverage, and loan terms. The recent\nrepricing of risk and strengthening of terms should be healthy in the longer term. However, a cautionary note: Leveraged lending tends to go through cycles of tighter, then\nlooser, underwriting standards. The pressures of competition for loan origination—including competition from nonbanks and hedge funds—may play through once again.\nFinally, should we expect the disappearance of foreign investors from U.S. credit markets? As you've probably read, foreign institutional investors have not avoided the\nrecent problems. Indeed, one of the realities exposed by the recent turmoil has been the geographic spread of investors, their direct exposure to subprime and CDO\nsecurities, and the scale of their losses. Given their losses, some pullback is predictable. There has been a widespread retreat from the subprime market, and I would not be\nsurprised if this persists for some time. But as regards the broader credit markets, including mortgage-backed securities, it's more likely foreign investors will be more\nselective and rely more on carefully vetted expert intermediaries in the selection process.\nThe fact of such substantial foreign exposure to the current problems suggests both the importance of foreign investors to the U.S. mortgage markets and the extent of the\ndollar recycling problem faced by foreign investors. I do not see permanent impairment of foreign investor participation in our credit markets. After a pause, the fundamental\nneed will reassert itself—owners of surplus capital must put their dollars to work.\n\n\fSo, as we move out of the current turmoil, I see the U.S. markets headed toward a \"new normal,\" not a return to normal. The recent turmoil has discredited the more dubious\ninnovations of the past few years. But the foundation of earlier innovations over the past three decades delivered too much value for us to return to the \"old-old\" ways of\nfinance.\nI believe the contours of the new normal will be:\na reformed, market-based system with a strong role for banks;\nthe continuation of securitization more narrowly applied and with strengthened origination, structuring, and risk evaluation practices;\nbetter investor practices with more self-reliance, along with a substantially reformed rating agency industry;\nsimplified and standardized instruments; and\nmuch refined risk management practices on the part of all market participants.\nAs I hope you detect, I am optimistic that the trauma of recent months will pass and our credit capital markets will be better for the lessons learned. Thank you.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Press release\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nUniversity of Alabama 2008 Economic Outlook Conference\nMontgomery, Ala.\nJanuary 17, 2008\nI'm honored by the invitation to speak at the University of Alabama's 2008 Economic Outlook Conference. It's a pleasure to visit Montgomery and\nget an up-close and personal look at the activity transforming this community. Alabama's economy has changed dramatically since business first\nbrought me to the state in the late 1970s and 1980s.\nA generation ago, Alabama's economy was far more dependent on \"old economy\" industries and less integrated into the broader national economy.\nAlabama at that time depended to a large extent on low-productivity manufacturing, agriculture, and military spending. During the 1990s, global\ncompetitive pressures, reduced defense spending, and technological change contributed to the loss of many jobs in Alabama—including thousands\nof jobs in textiles and apparel.\nBut despite some painful structural changes, Alabama has become more and more economically diverse. In the past few years, the state has\nbenefited from growth in business services, aerospace, health care, education, and other expanding industries. Investment in auto manufacturing\nalso has had a significant economic impact in the state. I will add that a highly productive and efficient auto industry has taken root in a number of states in the Southeast.\nBy the Southeast, I'm referring to the six states that encompass the Federal Reserve's Sixth District, which is home to some 45 million people. Looking at subregions of our\ndistrict, economic performance has varied widely. For instance, post-hurricane rebuilding has affected growth along the Gulf Coast. Also, the housing downturn has been\nquite severe in Florida. In that state, which is the largest in our region, the declining housing market has affected consumer incomes, spending, and employment as well as\nstate government finances. This dynamic has been evident in other parts of the Sixth District as well. The housing sector is a serious concern nationally and regionally,\nalthough certain areas in Tennessee and notably Alabama have been somewhat less affected so far.\nTaken as a whole, the Southeastern economy has experienced solid growth in recent years. Because of its size and diversity, the composition of the Southeast economy\nclosely matches that of the nation as a whole. Therefore, the region can be a useful barometer for activity in the broader U.S. economy.\nFor the rest of my remarks this afternoon, I plan to provide a brief summary of last year's U.S. economic story and an outlook for 2008. I'll also share some of my personal\nviews on Federal Reserve monetary policy during this difficult time of economic and financial adjustment. I'll tell you up front that my message will be a sober one. I want to\nadd that my comments are my views alone and do not represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nLooking back at 2007\nLet me begin by taking you back to a year ago. As 2006 turned into 2007, the economic environment appeared relatively benign compared to today. However, we now know\nthat housing activity—measured by sales, starts, and prices—began to slip in late 2005. Single-family housing starts peaked in the first quarter of 2006 at 1.7 million units on\nan annualized basis, compared with slightly less than a million units in the third quarter of 2007.\nBy midsummer 2006, the FOMC started noting the cooling of the housing market. The decline in housing activity coincided with a notable slowdown of economic growth\nthrough the end of 2006 and into the first part of 2007.\nThroughout 2007, forecasts of housing activity were repeatedly revised downward. Despite the intensifying housing \"correction,\" the economy grew smartly last spring and\nsummer. U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at annual rates of 3.8 percent in the second quarter and then a very strong 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2007.\nBut I believe those strong numbers contain anomalous factors that probably won't be repeated soon. Taking out an inventory buildup and exports, third quarter growth was\nmoderate—about half the GDP headline number. Fourth quarter data aren't available, but I expect growth during the final three months of 2007 to be modest.\nEvidence of slowing economic activity has been mounting. Beyond last year's sharp drop in residential investment, growth in manufacturing output remained well below its\nrate of the previous year. Also, spending on equipment and software showed only moderate growth in 2007. Commercial real estate has held up surprisingly well, but the\nsigns are that it will proceed more slowly going forward. Anecdotal reports suggest that many firms have begun to assume a wait-and-see posture because of rising\neconomic uncertainty, especially in the year's second half.\nAlso, over the past 20 or so months, year-over-year employment growth has slowed considerably. Readings on December employment released on January 4 showed a\nsmall monthly increase of 18,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate moving up from 4.7 to 5 percent. Historically, abrupt increases in the unemployment rate have been\nassociated with economic downturns.\nRecent employment data affected many observers' assessments of the risks to the economic outlook. Moreover, analysis by my staff suggests that the employment picture\nfor 2007 was weaker than recent statistics indicate.\nOf course, labor markets affect consumers. So let me turn to consumer spending, which is watched closely because of the significant role of personal consumption in our\neconomy. The news here also reflects slowing. Through November, last year's growth in personal consumption expenditures fell off the pace of 2006, which in turn was\nbelow its pace of 2005. Also in 2007, growth of real disposable personal income decelerated a bit. Retail sales results for the fourth quarter, released Tuesday, showed\nfurther slowing. Household spending has likely been weighed down by higher energy costs and declining house prices. Yet despite these pressures, consumer spending has\nnot plunged.\n\n\fFrom September 2006 through August 2007, readings on overall inflation were generally favorable. But later in the year food and energy costs surged, increasing pressure to\npass through higher prices for goods and services. For 2007, the consumer price index increased 4.1 percent—the largest calendar-year increase since 1990. The core CPI\n(excluding food and energy costs) increased 2.4 percent, which is above my comfort zone.\nReviewing the financial sector\nIn addition to these developments, the financial sector of our economy had an especially rough ride in 2007. By now, I'm sure you're all quite familiar with the story from Wall\nStreet, so I'll be brief. During the middle months of 2007, a weakening housing sector caused doubts about subprime mortgage-backed securities. Although subprime debt is\nless than 3 percent of the total market for dollar debt securities, these concerns triggered a widespread repricing of risk. When financial assets bearing risk are repriced,\ncredit spreads adjust and securities change value in relation to one another.\nThese developments happened after August of last year. Credit spreads widened, trading volume plummeted, and at various times bond and money markets froze because\nof concerns about counterparty creditworthiness. Accounting values of positions in subprime and other affected securities caused banks and other institutions to announce\nsizable losses. Further losses have been announced this week based on year-end values.\nSome off-balance-sheet positions in structured investment vehicles (so-called SIVs) were brought back onto their sponsors' books. Uncertainty about who had what exposure\ncaused illiquidity in interbank markets, and general illiquidity in securities markets kept trading volume low or nonexistent and values depressed.\nLast year ended with fears about bank funding over year-end, fears regarding the effect of SIV exposure on money market funds, and widespread concern about a credit\ncrunch.\nIt's fair to say financial markets were shaken profoundly between August and year-end, and trading conditions are still far from settled and orderly.\nFor a while after markets seized up in August, financial conditions did improve. I believe a series of globally coordinated central bank liquidity injections over the final months\nof the year helped to ease some market strains. At meetings in September, October, and December, the FOMC cut the fed funds rate to forestall some of the adverse effects\nof financial turmoil on the broader economy. But these actions were not sufficient to remedy Wall Street's distressed conditions.\nAs I prepare for each FOMC meeting, I gather real-time anecdotal economic intelligence from a variety of sources. I talk to, among others, bankers, hedge fund managers,\nand other financial market players. In my most recent conversations in December, they voiced serious concern about further—and spreading—market deterioration and\npotential spillover into the broad economy. From my contacts in the nonfinancial world, I generally get less strident impressions of current economic circumstances. Not long\nago, I heard qualitatively different perceptions from Main Street versus Wall Street. But in recent weeks almost all were quite worried about the economic outlook.\nThere is always uncertainty, but the New Year has opened with conditions of heightened uncertainty. For 2008, I believe the pivotal question—the central uncertainty—is the\nextent of current and future spillover from housing and financial markets to the general economy. The dynamics I'm watching—stated simplistically—are the following: first,\nthe effect of declining house prices on the consumer and in turn on retail sales and other personal expenditures and, second, the effect of financial market distress on credit\navailability and, in turn, on business investment, general business activity, and employment.\nThat said, my base case outlook sees a weak first half of 2008—but one of modest growth—with gradual improvement beginning in the year's second half and continuing into\n2009. This outcome assumes that the housing situation doesn't weaken more than expected and that financial markets stabilize. A sober assessment of risks must take into\naccount the possibility of protracted financial market instability together with a deep decline in house prices, volatile and high energy prices, continued dollar depreciation,\nand elevated inflation measures following from the recent upticks we've seen.\nI'm troubled by the elevated level of inflation, which has been pushed up by higher energy and food prices. A confluence of factors on the demand and supply side and the\npotential for slowing global economic growth have led many forecasters to believe energy prices will moderate. But the reality that these prices are set in an unpredictable\ngeopolitical context may mean my outlook is too optimistic. Nonetheless, I'm basing my working forecast on the view that inflation pressures will abate.\nEqually important is the state of inflation expectations. The United States and much of the world have enjoyed many years now of very moderate inflation. Even if recent\npressures from gasoline, energy in general, and food prices have been troubling, I believe the American public expects the inflation rate to gravitate to lower levels over the\nlong term.\nTo a large extent, my outlook for this year's economic performance hinges on how financial markets deal with their problems. The coming days and weeks could be telling.\nModern financial markets are an intricate global network of informed trust. Stabilization will proceed from clearing up the information deficit and restoring well-informed trust in\ncounterparties and confidence in the system overall.\nTo restore market confidence, leading financial firms, I believe, must recognize and disclose losses based on unimpeachable valuation calculations, seek investors where\nnecessary to restore capital ratios, and urgently execute the strenuous task of updating risk assessments of scores of counterparties. This process appears to be happening.\nThe good news is that markets can return to orderly functioning and financial institutions can be rehabilitated quickly. With healthy disclosure, facing up to losses,\nrecapitalization, and the resulting clarity, I believe there is hope for this outcome.\nA look at monetary policy\nFor monetary policymakers, the overriding concern must be the broad health and balance of the general economy going forward. In my view, recent Federal Reserve policy\nmoves appropriately processed information (both data and anecdotes) that then painted a mixed but slowing picture.\nAs you know, during our last meeting Dec. 11, the FOMC lowered the fed funds rate 25 basis points to 4.25 percent. The FOMC began cutting the fed funds rate in\nSeptember following the announcement in August that \"the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably.\" At that point, financial markets were in turmoil, and the fed\nfunds rate was 5.25 percent.\nThe decision to lower the fed funds rate was a response to acute stress in financial markets that had the potential to threaten economic growth.\nThe fed funds rate is the foundation of a structure of interest rates mostly set by the market. It is not a targeted policy instrument capable of dictating credit spreads and\nreducing illiquidity in specific debt markets—for example, the interbank lending market. For this reason, the Fed—along with foreign central banks—has put in place in recent\nweeks more targeted facilities to provide liquidity when and where needed.\n\n\fFor instance, last month the Fed announced the creation of the Term Auction Facility. With this program, depository institutions bid to borrow money from the Federal\nReserve on a fully collateralized basis. Since participants are bidding for funds, there is none of the usual stigma about turning to the lender of last resort, the Fed's discount\nwindow, for liquidity.\nI have been encouraged by the early results of these auctions and the other efforts by central banks in Europe to keep markets functioning. Since the beginning of 2008,\ncredit spreads have narrowed markedly in the bellwether interbank markets here and in Europe.\nIn his speech on January 10, Chairman Bernanke suggested that the Term Auction Facility may become a permanent component of the Fed's policy toolkit.\nResponding to developments\nThe future—even in stable times—is hard to read. At this juncture, the times present even greater uncertainty than usual. Recently, negative information has been exceeding\nexpectations. I think these circumstances call for policymakers to be prepared to respond pragmatically. In my view, pragmatism in the face of growing weakness in the\ngeneral economy may very well require additional moves to lower the federal funds rate.\nAs a policymaker, I feel acutely the tension between the need to promote growth and guard against the specter of higher prices. Implicit in my view is the forecast that\ninflation will moderate, allowing policy to focus on the very apparent near-term risks to the broad domestic economy.\nClearly, painful adjustments are under way in housing markets, mortgage markets, and money markets. I believe this process began in 2006, continued in 2007, and needs\nmuch of 2008 to play out. In the weeks and months ahead, I will be watching the process of these necessary adjustments closely as I work with my colleagues to determine\nthe appropriate monetary policy actions.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart’s biography • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

Taking out an inventory buildup and exports, third quarter growth was\nmoderate—about half the GDP headline number.

Although weakening, consumer spending has not\nplunged.\nFrom September 2006 through August 2007, readings on inflation were generally favorable, with consumer price inflation averaging around 2.3 percent on a year-over-year\nbasis. But later in the year energy costs surged, increasing pressure to pass through higher prices for goods and services. The consumer price index for November increased\nat a year-over-year rate of 4.3 percent, driven largely by a 21 percent jump in the energy cost component.\nReviewing the financial sector\nIn addition to these developments, the financial sector of our economy had an especially rough ride in 2007. You're all quite familiar with the storyline for Wall Street, so I'll\nskip the play-by-play and just provide highlights. During the middle months of 2007, a weakening housing sector caused doubts about subprime mortgage-backed securities.\nAlthough subprime debt is less than 3 percent of the total market for dollar debt securities, these concerns triggered a widespread repricing of risk.\nCredit spreads widened, trading volume plummeted, and at various times bond and money markets froze because of concerns about counterparty creditworthiness.\nAccounting values of positions in subprime and other affected securities caused banks and other institutions to announce sizable losses.\nSome off-balance-sheet positions in structured investment vehicles (so-called SIVs) were brought back onto sponsors' books.

I talk to, among others, bankers, hedge fund managers,\nand other financial market players. Most recently, they have given me the Wall Street perspective: that is, serious concern about further—and spreading—market\ndeterioration and potential spillover into the broad economy.\n\n\fI also talk to people whose address is Main Street. From these sources, I get the impression of an economy that is slowing but demonstrating resilience. Having said that, I\nthink we're at a time of heightened uncertainty.\nLooking to 2008, I believe the pivotal question—the central uncertainty—is the extent of current and future spillover from housing and financial markets to the general\neconomy. The dynamics I'm watching—stated simplistically—are the following. First, there's the effect of dropping house prices on the consumer and in turn on retail sales\nand other personal expenditures. And second, I'm watching the effect of financial market distress on credit availability and, in turn, on business investment, general business\nactivity, and employment.\nMy base case outlook sees a weak first half of 2008—but one of modest growth—with gradual improvement beginning in the year's second half and continuing into 2009.\nThis outcome assumes the housing situation doesn't deteriorate more than expected and financial markets stabilize. A sober assessment of risks must take account of the\npossibility of protracted financial market instability together with weakening housing prices, volatile and high energy prices, continued dollar depreciation, and elevated\ninflation measures following from the recent upticks we've seen.\nI'm troubled by the elevated level of inflation. Currently I expect that inflation will moderate in 2008 as projected declines in energy costs have their effect. But the recent\nupward rebound of oil prices—and the reality that they are set in an unpredictable geopolitical context—may mean my outlook is too optimistic. Nonetheless, I'm basing my\nworking forecast on the view that inflation pressures will abate.\nTo a large extent, my outlook for this year's economic performance hinges on how financial markets deal with their problems. The coming weeks could be telling. Modern\nfinancial markets are an intricate global network of informed trust. Stabilization will proceed from clearing up the information deficit and restoring well-informed trust in\ncounterparties and confidence in the system overall.\nTo restore market confidence, leading financial firms, I believe, must recognize and disclose losses based on unimpeachable valuation calculations, restore capital and\nliquidity ratios, and urgently execute the strenuous task of updating risk assessments of scores of counterparties. The good news is that markets can return to orderly\nfunctioning and financial institutions can be rehabilitated quickly. With healthy disclosure, facing up to losses, recapitalization, and the resulting clarity, I believe there is hope\nfor this outcome.\nA look at monetary policy\nFor monetary policymakers, the overriding concern must be the broad health and balance of the general economy going forward. In my view, recent Federal Reserve policy\nmoves appropriately processed information (both data and anecdotes) that painted a mixed but slowing picture.\nAs you know, during our last meeting Dec. 11, the FOMC lowered the fed funds rate 25 basis points to 4.25 percent. The FOMC began cutting the fed funds rate in\nSeptember following the announcement in August that \"the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably.\" At that point, financial markets were in turmoil, and the fed\nfunds rate was 5.25 percent.\nThe decision to lower the fed funds rate was a response to acute stress in financial markets that had the potential to threaten economic growth.\nThe fed funds rate is the foundation of a structure of interest rates mostly set by the market. It has been described as a blunt instrument in its influence over the broad\neconomy over time. It is not a targeted policy instrument capable of reducing illiquidity in specific debt markets—for example, the interbank lending market. For this reason,\nthe Fed—along with foreign central banks—has put in place in recent weeks more targeted facilities to provide liquidity when and where needed.\nFor instance, in December the Fed announced the Term Auction Facility. With this program, depository institutions bid to borrow money from the Federal Reserve on a fully\ncollateralized basis. Since participants are bidding for funds, there is none of the usual stigma about turning to the lender of last resort, the Fed's discount window, for\nliquidity.\nI have been encouraged by the early results of these auctions and the other efforts by central banks in Europe to keep markets functioning.\nResponding to developments\nThe future—even in stable times—is hard to read. At this juncture, the times present even greater uncertainty than usual. The negatives in our economy may be gaining\nmomentum. I think these circumstances call for policymakers to be prepared to respond pragmatically to whatever developments arise.\nClearly, adjustments—some quite painful—are under way in housing markets, mortgage markets, and money markets. These adjustments are needed to fix imbalances. This\nis what markets do—rebalance imbalances. I believe this process began in 2006, continued in 2007, and needs much of 2008 to play out. I will be watching the process of\nthese necessary adjustments closely as I work with my colleagues to determine the appropriate monetary policy actions.\nThank you for your attention today.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Press release • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nSoutheast Economic Strengths and Challenges\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRemarks for the chartering ceremony of the\nSoutheastern United States–Canadian Provinces Alliance\nMontreal, Quebec\nNovember 16, 2007\nIt's my honor to participate in the chartering ceremony for the Southeastern United States and Canadian Provinces Alliance.\nThe Atlanta Fed serves the Federal Reserve System's Sixth District, which includes Georgia, Alabama, and Florida and parts of Tennessee,\nLouisiana, and Mississippi. Although our district does not align precisely with the states involved in this alliance, it's a fair proxy for the economy of\nthe Southeast. For this occasion my references to the Southeast will include all of the states within the Sixth District as well as North and South\nCarolina.\nIn terms of industrial composition, the Southeast's economy is similar to the overall U.S. economy, which has a gross domestic product of $13\ntrillion. By comparison, the economic output of the Southeast is about $2.3 trillion—about the same size as the United Kingdom.\nTo provide some perspective on this large and diverse economic region, I will briefly comment on some of the region's strengths and challenges.\nStrengths\nThe first strength is the growing number of people in the Southeast region. Today, the population of the Southeast is about 58 million. Population in the region has increased\nsteadily with the trend of Americans migrating south because of the region's attractive weather, lifestyle, and economic opportunity—among other reasons.\nAnother strength is brainpower as reflected in the growth of knowledge workers and service industries. The Southeast is home to many high-quality institutions of higher\neducation. The Atlanta area alone has 45 universities and colleges—not counting postsecondary technical schools, according to the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.\nA broad historical trend in the Southeast is the substitution of traditional industries—for example, textiles—with technology-based industries and associated professional\nservices. Health care, education and tourism are growth industries.\nGrowth clusters—big and small—are located throughout the region. Last week I visited Huntsville, Ala., which was the cradle of America's space program after World War II.\nNow, Huntsville is home to many aerospace and engineering businesses. Other clusters can be found in Raleigh-Durham (biotech), Charlotte (banking), Nashville\n(healthcare and hospital management), Atlanta (logistics), and the Mississippi Gulf Coast (tourism and gaming). Obviously, this list is not exhaustive.\nIn addition, the Southeast is well positioned for trade. Of the nation's 50 largest ports in terms of total international trade, 15 are in the Southeast. During the past six years,\nthe value of international shipments across regional ports and airports has grown steadily. The Southeast also has strong connections to Latin America. Miami serves as a\ngateway to South America, and trade and investment connections are growing across the region.\nAnd there is very healthy north-south trade between Canada and the Southeast as shipments between these areas amount to many tens of millions of dollars each day. One\nreason for this connection is proximity. For instance, a truck delivery from Montreal to, say, Nashville takes about two days. The same shipment going west to Vancouver\nmight take as long as five days.\nTo emphasize the importance of Canada as a trading partner, the country is the largest export market for 36 U.S. states and a majority of Southeastern states.\nTrade in automobiles and vehicles is brisk, with growing shipments from the Southeast into Canada—a positive outgrowth of the region's vibrant vehicle parts and\nmanufacturing industry. Outside of the upper Midwest, the Southeast is the auto industry's second home in the United States.\nChallenges\nDespite the development of efficient manufacturing facilities, the region in recent decades has suffered the loss of many factory jobs—particularly in the apparel and textile\nindustries. Although overall unemployment in the region is a bit lower than the United States as a whole, many workers in the region have not adjusted to changing\ntechnologies and global competitive pressures.\nMany of the kindergarten through 12th grade schools in the Southeast fall below national averages by certain measures of performance, and pockets of poverty—especially\nin rural areas—are a lingering problem.\nAs you know, parts of the Southeast are currently experiencing serious drought conditions. Although perhaps a temporary problem, this situation points out the need for longterm resource management planning.\nFinally, I should point out that the Southeast recently has begun to suffer from too much of a good thing when it comes to housing. Many lenders, builders, and other\nbusinesses failed to anticipate the end of the housing boom that lasted from 2001–05. In the aftermath of residential overbuilding, a painful adjustment is taking place with\nhouse prices stagnant or declining and housing starts dropping sharply in many areas in the region.\nI should mention that with the strong Canadian dollar and weak housing markets, the Southeast has the potential to benefit from second-home residential investment by\nCanadians. Canada's demographic profile is slightly older than the United States. And need I say that Southeast beaches are warmer in January?\n\n\fBenefits of trade, investment and collaboration\nTaken as a whole, I believe that the economic strengths of the Southeast far outweigh its challenges. Throughout its history, the Southeastern economy has shown enormous\nresilience and an ability to respond to challenges.\nAlthough not contiguous, Canada and the Southeast are both well positioned to benefit from the interconnection of their economies through trade, investment, and\ncollaboration. I applaud the leaders for advancing closer explicit ties between our two economies. I believe this alliance will provide concrete economic benefits to everyone\ninvolved.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart’s biography • Speakers Bureau • Atlanta Fed Speeches\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nJoint Meeting of the Huntsville Rotary Club and the Greater Huntsville Rotary Club\nHuntsville, Ala.\nNovember 7, 2007\nI'm honored to speak at this joint meeting of the Huntsville Rotary Club and the Greater Huntsville Rotary Club. I arrived here this morning and just\nvisited the Hudson-Alpha Institute of Biotechnology—more evidence that your community is a center of innovation. Huntsville's unique attributes\nand ongoing prosperity are reminders that in today's world it's human capital—brain power—that accounts for much of the wealth creation and\neconomic resilience. While I'm here over the next two days I plan to visit with some businesses and leaders to find out more about this area's\nvibrant economy.\nI first came to Huntsville in the 1980s, calling on some of your leading corporations. At that time, I was intrigued by Huntsville's cluster of defense\nand technology businesses. Before that, as a schoolboy growing up in California in the 1950s and '60s, I knew something of the story of Wernher\nvon Braun and the rocket scientists who came to Huntsville after World War II. In the fourth grade, as I recall, I actually tried to build a to-scale\nmodel of a rocket in my backyard using crates and cardboard. When my father gently suggested I remove that piece of junk from the premises, I\nconcluded I might not be destined for a career in rocket science.\nBut in my banking and finance career, I've been exposed to a different breed of rocket scientists. Instead of exploring the frontiers of space, these so-called rocket scientists\nhave pushed the boundaries of finance. I believe this subject is timely because financial innovations have a major bearing on economic activity—not just on Wall Street but\nalso on Main Streets throughout the United States.\nAlso this afternoon I plan to discuss the current economy. My remarks have the disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone—and not those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve's monetary policy setting body.\nThe economic situation\nGiven the importance of the defense industry in Huntsville's economy, I suspect a number of people in the room have some military background. Perhaps some of you\nremember the term \"sitrep.\" For those not familiar with military terminology, a sitrep (situation report) is a current, real-time assessment of conditions and forces on a\nbattlefield. Let me offer a sitrep of our current economy.\nRecent economic data present a mixed picture, but basically one of continued strength. The first report of third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth issued last\nWednesday had the economy growing at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent—a slight increase from strong growth in the second quarter. This year's solid growth has taken\nplace despite widespread and well-publicized weakness in the housing sector.\nResidential weakness is reflected in almost every national housing statistic, including a 23 percent year-over-year decline in the sales of new single-family homes in\nSeptember and a 30 percent drop in building permits.\nSo far, evidence of spillover from problems in housing to the broader economy is limited. For instance, personal consumption has held up surprisingly well, and national job\nmarket data for October released after the last FOMC meeting were encouraging. According to the initial estimate, nonfarm payroll employment increased by 166,000 in\nOctober—the largest gain since May. Net exports have also been very strong recently, propelled by a combination of strong global demand and the depreciation of the dollar.\nIn addition to growth, I'm keeping a close watch on prices. Readings on inflation have improved this year, and I believe that inflation will most likely continue to moderate as\nmeasured by so-called core inflation indices. But there are some inflationary risks. In particular, recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, could\nput renewed upward pressure on headline inflation—the inflation you and I encounter in the marketplace.\nDespite the positive readings on recent economic performance outside the housing sector, my forecast calls for below trend, slower GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2007\nand first half of next year. This forecast anticipates further weakness in housing in the near term and the likelihood that declines in housing wealth will contribute to a\nweakening of the pace of consumer spending.\nFOMC actions\nIt should be no surprise that the troubles in the financial sector were a topic of discussion at last week's FOMC meeting. At this meeting, you'll recall the Fed lowered the\ntarget for the fed funds rate 25 basis points to 4.5 percent. This move followed a cut of 50 basis points announced after our FOMC meeting September 18.\nThe FOMC noted on October 31 that \"economic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat.\" However, the committee added\n\"the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction.\" The committee believed its October 31 policy\naction, combined with its action taken in September, \"should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the\ndisruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.\"\nAs discussed a moment ago, my view of the economy is consistent with the FOMC statement, and I supported last week's policy action. In part, my position was based on\nthe notion of insurance against downside risks to the general economy given the unusually high level of uncertainty.\nI base that assessment on both recent hard data and what I'm hearing from business and financial industry contacts. These contacts provide timely and detailed information\nthat is extremely valuable to a Reserve Bank, particularly during transitional periods.\n\n\fSome anecdotal information contradicts the picture suggested by recent data. Recent feedback from our Reserve Bank board members and other contacts on the ground is\nsomewhat more negative than the numbers suggest. For instance, anecdotally we hear that attitudes toward future discretionary capital investment have grown more\ncautious since the onset of financial market turmoil. I attribute negative sentiment about future capital expenditures more to growing pessimism about economic growth rather\nthan to restrictive credit conditions for businesses.\nIf I were to use one word to characterize our current economic circumstances, that word would be \"uncertain.\" Much of this uncertainty relates to the potential depth, length,\nand impact of the housing downturn and potential flow-back to Main Street from the turbulence we have seen on Wall Street.\nFinancial market turbulence\nFederal Reserve officials ground monetary policy deliberations mostly in the outlook for the general economy. In these times this focus cannot be uncoupled from concern\nabout the financial sector. This connection exists because credit plays a vital role in fueling virtually all aspects of economic activity. The current level of uncertainty\nnecessarily has a financial markets dimension. So for the sake of a more complete picture, I would like to briefly discuss the evolution of our financial system that brings us to\nwhere we are today.\nWhen I started my banking career in the 1970s, banks were the dominant intermediaries in the credit system. Banks mostly kept exposure on their books. In those days we\nspoke of the \"Cs of credit\"—cash flow, collateral, and character—and character reflected the admonition to know your borrower and assess the intangibles of your client. Old\ntimers in those days said, \"Companies don't repay loans, people do.\"\nOver the last several decades we've seen an evolution from a bank-centered financial intermediation system to a market-centered system. As a result, lenders have become\ninvestors, loan spreads have become investment yields, and individual loans have become the feedstock of pools of like assets brought together through a process known as\nsecuritization. These changes have had significant implications both for loan underwriting and where in the system loans are ultimately held.\nIn terms of underwriting, the old \"banker-looking-borrower-in-the-eye\" business model has been largely replaced by an \"originate and distribute\" business model.\nStandardization of loan terms has allowed many classes of loans—to individuals and businesses—to be channeled into marketable securities. The new underwriting model\nfor many types of loans relies on credit scoring and quantifiable measures of the borrower's repayment capacity and the loan's collateral. Loans become units of statistically\nmodeled pools of assets.\nIn terms of who owns the loans, the holders could be almost anywhere. A Huntsville mortgage may be held by a local bank, but it could just as easily be held by a New York\ninvestment bank, a London hedge fund, an Asian bank, or a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.\nIn the global asset management industry that invests in credit instruments, competition is intense. Small increments of yield can result in performance that differentiates one\nmanager from another. So the incentive to pursue better yield for apparently equivalent risk is very compelling for these investment managers.\nWe all know that in today's world—especially in the credit securities markets—there are few, if any, low-risk, high-return investments waiting to be discovered. As a result,\nmany portfolio managers have sought to boost the returns on their portfolios by using leverage. While this leverage may be obtained in various ways, the end result is similar\nto an individual investor buying stock on margin or buying an option on a stock.\nNone of this is to imply that banks have become irrelevant to modern finance. They remain very important to our system, but the reality is that banks are not as dominant as\nthey once were. In their place has emerged a constellation of asset and investment managers that includes money market funds, hedge funds, and specialized players. We\nused to call some of these groups \"nonbank banks.\" Suffice to say, the makeup of today's credit intermediation system is quite complex.\nBenefits of financial rocket science\nAccompanying increased complexity, the market-centered evolution of our credit system has brought many benefits. The innovations of Wall Street's rocket scientists have\nmade markets more efficient, deeper, and more liquid.\nSpecifically, financial innovations have provided credit to classes of borrowers who were previously denied access and allowed financial institutions to diversify their often\ngeography-bound risk exposure. Through securitization, risk and yield can now be cut to fit the exacting needs of investors worldwide. Innovations in securitization have\nturned risky individual exposures—which would require high rates of return—into diversified pools of loans qualifying for lower rates, with those lower rates partially passed\nback to individual borrowers.\nThis financial \"rocket science\" has on balance been positive for society. But, predictably, financial innovation and the evolution of the credit system have brought new\nchallenges. As mentioned, today's institutions, portfolios, and securities can be extremely complex. And this complexity is compounded by opacity. Compared to the past,\ntoday's system is opaque.\nVisibility—or information—is limited in a variety of ways. First, knowing where risk lies in the system is a challenge. Determining the extent of leverage assumed by investors\nis a challenge. Holders of mortgage-backed and otherwise collateralized securities are challenged to value new instruments encompassing asset pools that have little\nperformance history. And liquidity-providing market participants often suffer from limited visibility into the risk positions carried by actual or potential counterparties.\nClearly, the current circumstances of this new world of financial markets—credit markets—present serious challenges, and then there is the continuing housing sector\nweakness. So how will the story play out?\nA story of transition\nLet me describe three potential story lines, emphasizing the one I believe represents the most likely scenario for the economy.\nThe first is a very adverse scenario with housing and financial markets severely affecting real economic activity. In this story, extreme balance sheet pressures cause lending\ninstitutions to cut back their regular lending to households and businesses, and the dynamic becomes circular, feeding back on itself. A colleague termed this hypothetical\nscenario an \"adverse feedback loop\" in a recent speech. I want to emphasize that I view this outcome as being quite unlikely.\nAnother story line holds that recent developments in financial markets are a mere hiccup—a temporary dislocation of financial markets followed by a return to normalcy as\ndefined by conditions and practices that prevailed before this summer. I don't view this scenario as realistic. I believe markets, institutions, and risk management practices\n\n\fhave been affected profoundly by recent experience.\nIn my view, the most likely story line is one involving a moderate slowdown in economic activity over the coming quarters, with a return to growth near trend by late 2008 as\nthe housing sector begins to recover. Underpinning this story is the view that our modern market economy has a keen ability to self-correct as opportunistic capital moves\ninto depressed markets. Markets correct. And market solutions are preferable. This transition already is happening in the market for subprime mortgages. In this story,\nfinancial markets may endure some more weeks or months of volatility, but I believe they will find a restructured state of \"normality,\" involving improved risk management\npractices, reduced leverage, and greater transparency.\nAn appropriate public policy posture is to be supportive of market solutions in the financial markets. During our past two meetings, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate\ntarget by 75 basis points. While aimed mostly at the macroeconomy, these reductions, I believe, also support those purposes.\nAs already explained, I joined the Atlanta Fed in March of this year. No surprise, but I've learned firsthand that the job involves intense tracking and discussion of the state\nand path of the economy. We have some near-term uncertainty, but one cannot help being impressed with the continuing resilience of the U.S. economy. That conclusion\nisn't rocket science, but it gives comfort as the economy works through our current difficulties.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Press release • Speakers Bureau\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAtlanta Business Chronicle Best in Business Breakfast\nAtlanta, Ga.\nSeptember 10, 2007\n(The text for this speech is slightly modified from Lockhart's remarks originally delivered to the Atlanta Press Club on Thursday, Sept. 6, 2007.)\nI'm honored to speak at the Best in Business breakfast at this challenging time for national economic policy.\nThis is my second move to Atlanta. My first introduction to Atlanta was the summer of 1978. My wife and I found a vibrant and welcoming city that\ndeserved the title \"capital of the New South.\"\nMy wife—now deceased—was a Southerner from Virginia. This week would have been our 35th wedding anniversary. Part of my affection for this\nplace and the South in general derives from my many great years with her including 10 years here in Atlanta.\nI remember many amusing stories about her Virginia upbringing, but one—a story from her college years—seems to fit the current circumstances.\nShe attended Hollins College in Roanoke, Va. There, she took an art history course from a professor she described as brilliant, passionate about\nart, but a little odd in dress and mannerisms. We all have a mental image of such a college professor. When it came time for the final exam in the course, he passed out a\nsheet with this very concise assignment. The exam question read, \"After the visual feast comes the dyspeptic sequelae. Discuss.\"\nTranslated, that phrase refers to indigestion. And the discomfort (or worse) we sometimes feel after a big meal seems an apt way to describe conditions in the housing sector\nand the debt capital markets. This morning, I will discuss recent events in housing and capital markets. I'll also share with you some principles I use to help guide my thinking\non Federal Reserve actions in times like these.\nThe housing downturn spreads to capital markets\nSince I became Atlanta Fed president in March, I have devoted particular attention to the sharp and persistent downturn in the housing sector both nationally and in the\nSoutheast.\nFor instance, the nation's inventory of new homes for sale has increased sharply this year and is now almost eight months' supply at the current pace of sales. Housing\npermits in July declined nationally by around 24 percent from a year earlier.\nThe problems with housing are also evident in housing finance—the mortgage market. I know you are all very much aware of the subprime mortgage market—the epicenter\nof recent turmoil in financial markets. Let me provide a little background.\nOur nation has more than $10 trillion of mortgage debt. About 60 percent is securitized. In other words, these individual mortgages are no longer held as assets on the books\nof banks or other mortgage originators but have been pooled. The pools have been structured as securities that have been sold and traded in a vast and growing global\nmarket.\nBuyers have included structured investment vehicles (SIVs) fully or partially devoted to subprime mortgage securities, money market funds, hedge funds, foreign banks,\ninsurance companies, pension funds, and other investment funds. Exposure to the U.S. mortgage market has been distributed globally. In fact, we don't know exactly where\nall the exposure to this class of securities rests.\nThe linkages are complex, but here is my synopsis of recent market turmoil. Since mid-2006, home price appreciation slowed, and recently prices have fallen in some\nmarkets. Earlier in 2007, markets perceived that subprime mortgage credit quality was deteriorating markedly. Delinquencies among subprime borrowers have been rising\nand are expected to continue to rise as many borrowers have difficulty refinancing. The initial low rates on their adjustable-rate mortgages are resetting to higher rates that\nimply much higher monthly payments. At the same time, stagnant housing prices have eliminated their option of refinancing at lower rates or selling their house at a profit.\nThe spike in delinquencies has affected not only the mortgage holders but also other segments of financial markets, including the market for asset-backed commercial paper.\nAs background, the commercial paper market links investors directly with corporate borrowers without intermediation by banks. About half the current commercial paper\nmarket is so-called SIVs that invest in financial assets. Holders of the asset-backed commercial paper obligations of SIVs came to recognize the increased risk and, in many\ncases, refused to roll over or refinance the short-term debt of these borrowers.\nIn turn, the securities that included significant amounts of the subprime mortgages became hard to value. The secondary market for these securities shrank dramatically. I\nwould describe this development as a closed loop. Valuation uncertainty reduced secondary market trading. Little or no trading made it even more difficult or impossible to\nvalue the securities by market price.\nFaced with these valuation difficulties, broader market participants have become wary of classes of structured debt securities beyond subprime. For instance, markets for\njumbo prime mortgages also experienced liquidity problems.\nInvestment funds believed to be heavily exposed to subprime mortgage–backed securities and other structured debt securities have faced some redemptions and\ncancellation of borrowing facilities used to acquire the securities in the first place. This development forced sales of other classes of securities in their portfolios, and\n\n\finstitutional sponsors of these investment funds have been called upon to support their distressed funds.\nMany investment funds bought these securities \"on margin\" (using debt), and this fact is important. By employing leverage, many funds pursued enhanced returns. But now\nwe're seeing firms try to improve their liquidity by reducing debt and lowering their exposure to risky assets. This process—called deleveraging—appears to be widespread\nacross the financial system.\nThe recoiling from risk in general is affecting an unrelated market—the leveraged loan market used by private equity deal sponsors. This market has backed up markedly—\nloan commitments intended for syndication have not closed because of weak distribution prospects. By some estimates, more than $400 billion of such financings are in\nbacklog.\nEquity markets have experienced more volatility at least in part because of an increasingly uncertain environment for corporate earnings and the stalling of buyout activity.\nInformation deficit and repricing of risk\nThe current conditions of the capital markets—particularly the debt capital markets—have been described as a credit crunch, a liquidity squeeze, a liquidity crisis becoming a\nsolvency crisis, a crisis of information, and a repricing of risk. I'd like to comment on two of these interpretations, namely, the information deficit and the repricing of risk.\nThe markets are indeed experiencing a significant information deficit. Market participants are struggling to discover, one, the true performance of subprime pools, two, where\nexposure to these and other structured instruments ultimately rests, three, the risk, therefore, associated with trading and borrowing counterparties, and, four, the linkages\nbetween asset classes, funding markets, and institution-to-institution exposures.\nThe opaque nature of our current financial world is the result of a long trend of replacing direct bank lending with less transparent investment vehicles in securities markets.\nIn the coming weeks we will see more disclosure of institutional gains and losses as well as performance trends of portfolios and securities. But I believe clarity will take more\ntime.\nSecond, in my view, we're witnessing more than just a repricing of risk. The credit markets of recent years feasted on a low cost of capital through leveraged investing and\naggressive financing structures at both the retail and wholesale levels. I believe we're also seeing a broad retreat from higher-risk practices, such as\nno document/no equity mortgages,\ncovenant-light leveraged buyouts, and\nthe carry trade—in other words, borrowing in one currency to invest unhedged in debt instruments in another.\nI believe we've been experiencing the unpleasant process of the financial world changing its ways after a prolonged period of relatively cheap credit and in consequence,\nhigh leverage. What we've been going through is an intense adjustment in both price and practice, and this process may be continuing.\nHow did all this come about? Underlying these developments was a financial world awash with funds (or liquidity) looking to be invested. Low interest rates were a worldwide\nphenomenon during and after the 2001 recession. Despite many central banks raising short-term rates since 2004, long-term rates have remained relatively low. Low rates—\ncombined with the ample liquidity provided by globally integrated capital markets—provided an environment for financial innovation. We also saw aggressive practices and\nthe use of leverage.\nEconomic performance and price stability\nUntil a few weeks ago, the liquidity conditions continued, and the outlook was good, on balance. Global growth was (and remains) strong. After a weak first quarter, U.S.\ngrowth was expected to rebound strongly in the second quarter, which is what occurred.\nWith the exception of declines in housing-related industries such as construction, building supplies and mortgage servicing, employment growth overall was maintained\nthrough the first half of the year. But new employment data released last Friday reflected downward revisions for June and July, with moderating job growth in services\nindustries. In August hiring declined for the first time in four years.\nReadings from July show that consumer spending remained strong, and business investment during the second quarter picked up momentum. The most serious negative\naspect was—and is—the housing sector.\nMy colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I have been watching for signs of spillover from the housing and mortgage market adjustment into other sectors of the economy,\nespecially consumer spending. Weakening home prices, less available credit, and higher interest rates could cause a slowdown in home equity withdrawal for consumption.\nThe reduction in overall household wealth could pull down overall household spending.\nLast Thursday, I said in a speech that I had not seen conclusive signs of weakness in the broader economy. Friday's data, however, show employment was beginning to\nsoften back in June. This news should be evaluated with recently positive reports in retail sales. I'm processing this information along with other timely information as I\nprepare for next week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\nAt our August 7 meeting, the FOMC described economic growth as \"moderate.\" At that time, the statement said, \"the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the\nrisk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.\"\nThis statement reflected the importance of the Fed's ongoing efforts to lean against inflation pressures. In a sequence of 17 rate hikes, the Fed increased the federal funds\nrate from 1 percent in June 2004 to 5.25 percent in June 2006, where it has since rested.\nI believe these efforts have yielded measurable success. Inflationary pressures have softened somewhat in recent months. Inflation expectations remain well contained. By\nsome measures, the pace of inflation is now around 2 percent.\nIn my view current readings of inflation represent progress, but not victory. I would like to see inflation sustained at a somewhat lower rate—with emphasis on \"sustained.\"\n\n\fIf inflation is allowed to accelerate, bringing it back down will be costly and painful. High and unstable inflation can distort economic decision making and—once ratified by\npublic expectations—is difficult to reverse. By contrast, low and stable inflation fosters an economy that's conducive to rational business activity and resistant to exogenous\nshocks.\nLooking back to a month ago, it seemed—all in all—we had ongoing economic expansion and declining inflation.\nA change in circumstances\nThen, after our last FOMC meeting, deteriorating conditions in financial markets changed the economic outlook. On August 17, the FOMC statement said that \"the downside\nrisks to growth have increased appreciably.\" The balance of risk to the economy seems to have shifted. We're facing greater uncertainty in the economic outlook.\nAs you know, I'm a new central banker and policymaker. But I bring to this new role experience in the financial sector touching on a wide range of business lines, asset\nclasses, and types of institutions. I know during a feast there is a strong incentive for market participants to meet the competition and seek competitive advantage by pushing\nthe risk-reward envelope.\nSome of this pushing of limits amounts to sustainable innovation. Many of these innovations served desirable ends and allocated greater risk to those investors who had an\nappetite for it. The subprime mortgage market has brought the American dream of home ownership to many people who previously could not qualify for mortgage loans.\nThese developments, on balance, have been a good thing. But some pushing of limits, in my view, will prove to have been imprudent excess.\nThe causes and possible consequences of the current turmoil in financial markets were discussed widely the week before last at the Kansas City Fed's annual conference in\nJackson Hole, Wyo. The conference focused on housing, housing finance, and monetary policy and was attended by central bankers, academics, financial practitioners, as\nwell as members of the press. As expected, analysis and opinion were varied, and policy prescriptions ran the gamut from strong intervention to cautious and watchful\nmonitoring of developments.\nIn his remarks at the conference, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated that the Fed stands ready to take whatever action is needed. His remarks followed previous actions\nto inject liquidity into the financial system through open market operations and the discount window.\nI believe the essence of our current challenge is to balance three interconnected and potentially conflicting concerns: timely action in response to risks to the total economy,\npreservation of gains achieved on the inflation front, and overall financial system stability.\nA matter of principles\nWhen confronted with complexity, uncertainty, and fluidity as we're currently experiencing, my approach is to ground my thinking and judgments in organizing principles. Let\nme share with you how I think about policy in times like these.\nFirst, there is the principle of market discipline. Markets must be allowed to work. The risks and rewards of market participation should play out—to the extent possible—\nwithout interference. Policy should enable natural market functioning. Market participants should expect and actually experience accountability for their decisions through\nnatural market processes. It is not the role of monetary authorities to change the risk-reward tradeoff of investment instruments and markets.\nUnwarranted intervention in financial markets raises concerns about moral hazard. This problem could occur if investors come to believe that—because of likely Fed\nintervention—they are immune from severe downside risk. Intervention can distort risks and create incentives to take exaggerated investment positions.\nWhether or not to intervene in markets is a judgment call. Although I believe that Fed intervention is appropriate if markets are clearly not working properly, I am aware of the\npotential pitfalls of such interventions. Caution may cause some observers to argue that the central bank is insufficiently preemptive in its actions. But I believe the Fed's\nlonger-term objectives are well served by a deliberate and measured response to financial market turbulence. Such a response should distinguish, as much as possible,\nbetween liquidity actions aimed at keeping markets orderly and monetary actions aimed at cushioning the economy from the impact of financial market instability.\nA second principle, however, is that the Fed has a responsibility to promote financial system stability. This responsibility at times may require actions that might seem to run\ncounter to the first principle. If done effectively, there need be no necessary conflict between actions taken to ensure the orderly functioning of markets and the principle of\nallowing markets to efficiently allocate gains and losses.\nJust last month, as investors became more and more reluctant to accept debt associated with subprime mortgages, markets began to seize up. Markets suffered illiquidity\nand essential transactions were not taking place. In some instances, lenders could not lend, borrowers could not borrow, traders could not trade, and accountants could not\nvalue positions.\nOne of the Fed's tools is providing liquidity. For several successive days in mid-August, the Fed injected liquidity through its daily open market operations. Then, on August\n17, the Fed's Board of Governors announced a 50 basis point reduction in its primary credit discount rate for loans to financial institutions. This action (along with others)\nreduced the premium for borrowing from the central bank.\nMarkets responded favorably to these actions, but further volatility cannot be ruled out. As the FOMC said August 17, \"the Committee is monitoring the situation and is\nprepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.\"\nMy third informing principle is sustained focus on fundamental purposes and responsibilities. In the Fed's case, these are our long-run mandates to foster maximum\nsustainable growth and stable inflation. I believe it's important to keep in mind the longer-run implications of policy—what happens tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and\nbeyond. Allegiance to core institutional purpose has served the country well for many years.\nA balancing act\nTo recap: My first principle is let markets work. The second principle is the central bank has a responsibility to promote orderly conditions in financial markets, stepping in as\nnecessary to avoid severe system disruption. The third principle is to make sure the second principle doesn't undermine our long-term mission.\nThere are certainly tensions to be resolved in applying these principles, and formulating measured responses to circumstances requires good judgment, particularly in\ntransitional periods. I believe we are in such a period now.\n\n\fSo, after the feast comes the dyspeptic sequelae. Fancy phrasing, but a simple notion. Housing and financial markets have feasted on a period of low rates and easy credit.\nI'm confident that market conditions eventually will settle down. As we move forward, my voice in Fed deliberations will be aimed at balancing response to immediate\nproblems with concern for the best outcome for the long run.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart biography • Speakers Bureau • Atlanta Fed Speeches\n\n\f"

            "content": "SPEECHES\n\nAfter the Feast\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAtlanta Press Club\nAtlanta, Ga.\nSeptember 6, 2007\nThank you. I'm honored to speak to the Atlanta Press Club at this challenging time for national economic policy.\nThis is my second move to Atlanta. My first introduction to Atlanta was the summer of 1978. My wife and I found a vibrant and welcoming city that\ndeserved the title \"capital of the New South.\"\nMy wife—now deceased—was a Southerner from Virginia. This week would have been our 35th wedding anniversary. Part of my affection for this\nplace and the South in general derives from my many great years with her including 10 years here in Atlanta.\nI remember many amusing stories about her Virginia upbringing, but one—a story from her college years—seems to fit the current circumstances.\nShe attended Hollins College in Roanoke, Va. There, she took an art history course from a professor she described as brilliant, passionate about\nart, but a little odd in dress and mannerisms. We all have a mental image of such a college professor. When it came time for the final exam in the course, he passed out a\nsheet with this very concise assignment. The exam question read, \"After the visual feast comes the dyspeptic sequelae. Discuss.\"\nTranslated, that phrase refers to indigestion. And the discomfort (or worse) we sometimes feel after a big meal seems an apt way to describe conditions in the housing sector\nand the debt capital markets. This afternoon, I will discuss recent events in housing and capital markets. I'll also share with you some principles I use to help guide my\nthinking on Federal Reserve actions in times like these.\nThe housing downturn spreads to capital markets\nSince I became Atlanta Fed president in March, I have devoted particular attention to the sharp and persistent downturn in the housing sector both nationally and in the\nSoutheast.\nFor instance, the nation's inventory of new homes for sale has increased sharply this year and is now almost eight months' supply at the current pace of sales. Housing\npermits in July declined nationally by around 24 percent from a year earlier.\nThe problems with housing are also evident in housing finance—the mortgage market. I know you are all very much aware of the subprime mortgage market—the epicenter\nof recent turmoil in financial markets. Let me provide a little background.\nOur nation has more than $10 trillion of mortgage debt. About 60 percent is securitized. In other words, these individual mortgages are no longer held as assets on the books\nof banks or other mortgage originators but have been pooled. The pools have been structured as securities that have been sold and traded in a vast and growing global\nmarket.\nBuyers have included structured investment vehicles (SIVs) fully or partially devoted to subprime mortgage securities, money market funds, hedge funds, foreign banks,\ninsurance companies, pension funds, and other investment funds. Exposure to the U.S. mortgage market has been distributed globally. In fact, we don't know exactly where\nall the exposure to this class of securities rests.\nThe linkages are complex, but here is my synopsis of recent market turmoil. Since mid-2006, home price appreciation slowed, and recently prices have fallen in some\nmarkets. Earlier in 2007, markets perceived that subprime mortgage credit quality was deteriorating markedly. Delinquencies among subprime borrowers have been rising\nand are expected to continue to rise as many borrowers have difficulty refinancing. The initial low rates on their adjustable-rate mortgages are resetting to higher rates that\nimply much higher monthly payments. At the same time, stagnant housing prices have eliminated their option of refinancing at lower rates or selling their house at a profit.\nThe spike in delinquencies has affected not only the mortgage holders but also other segments of financial markets, including the market for asset-backed commercial paper.\nAs background, the commercial paper market links investors directly with corporate borrowers without intermediation by banks. About half the current commercial paper\nmarket is so-called SIVs that invest in financial assets. Holders of the asset-backed commercial paper obligations of SIVs came to recognize the increased risk and, in many\ncases, refused to roll over or refinance the short-term debt of these borrowers.\nIn turn, the securities that included significant amounts of the subprime mortgages became hard to value. The secondary market for these securities shrank dramatically. I\nwould describe this development as a closed loop. Valuation uncertainty reduced secondary market trading. Little or no trading made it even more difficult or impossible to\nvalue the securities by market price.\nFaced with these valuation difficulties, broader market participants have become wary of classes of structured debt securities beyond subprime. For instance, markets for\njumbo prime mortgages also experienced liquidity problems.\nInvestment funds believed to be heavily exposed to subprime mortgage—backed securities and other structured debt securities have faced some redemptions and\ncancellation of borrowing facilities used to acquire the securities in the first place. This development forced sales of other classes of securities in their portfolios, and\ninstitutional sponsors of these investment funds have been called upon to support their distressed funds.\n\n\fMany investment funds bought these securities \"on margin\" (using debt), and this fact is important. By employing leverage, many funds pursued enhanced returns. Efforts by\ninvestment funds to improve their liquidity and reduce exposure to risky assets involved reducing the amount of outstanding debt. This process—called deleveraging—\nappears to be widespread across the financial system.\nThe recoiling from risk in general is affecting an unrelated market—the leveraged loan market used by private equity deal sponsors. This market has backed up markedly—\nloan commitments intended to be syndicated have not been able to close because of weak distribution prospects. By some estimates, more than $400 billion of such\nfinancings are in backlog.\nEquity markets have experienced increased volatility at least in part because of an increasingly uncertain environment for corporate earnings and the stalling of buyout\nactivity.\nInformation deficit and repricing of risk\nThe current conditions of the capital markets—particularly the debt capital markets—have been described as a credit crunch, a liquidity squeeze, a liquidity crisis becoming a\nsolvency crisis, a crisis of information, and a repricing of risk. I'd like to comment on two of these interpretations, namely, the information deficit and the repricing of risk.\nThe markets are indeed experiencing a significant information deficit. Market participants are struggling to discover 1) the true performance of subprime pools, 2) where\nexposure to these and other structured instruments ultimately rests, 3) the risk, therefore, associated with trading and borrowing counterparties, and 4) the linkages between\nasset classes, funding markets, and institution-to-institution exposures.\nThe opaque nature of our current financial world is the result of a long trend of replacing direct bank lending with less transparent investment vehicles in securities markets.\nIn the coming weeks we will see more disclosure of gains and losses on exposure as well as performance trends of portfolios and securities, but I believe clarity will take\nsome time to develop.\nSecond, in my view, we're witnessing more than just a repricing of risk. The credit markets of recent years feasted on a low cost of capital through leveraged investing and\naggressive financing structures at both the retail and wholesale levels. I believe we're also seeing a broad retreat from higher-risk practices, such as\nno document/no equity mortgages,\ncovenant-light leveraged buyouts, and\nthe carry trade—in other words, borrowing in one currency to invest unhedged in debt instruments in another.\nI believe we've been experiencing the unpleasant process of the financial world changing its ways after a prolonged period of relatively cheap credit, and in consequence,\nhigh leverage.

Weakening home prices, less available credit, and higher interest rates could cause a slowdown in home equity withdrawal for consumption.\nThe reduction in overall household wealth could pull down overall household spending.\nBecause much of the incoming data are backward looking, central bankers also must keep their ears to the ground to listen for changes. To identify at the earliest possible\nmoment a change in the direction for the national economy, I rely on real-time information obtained in part from our contacts around the region. This anecdotal input is\nespecially valuable in times of volatility and possible transition. So far, I have not seen hard or soft data that provide conclusive signs that housing problems are spilling over\ninto the broad economy.\nAt our August 7 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) described economic growth as \"moderate.\" At that time, the statement said, \"the Committee's\npredominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.\"\nThis statement reflected the importance of the Fed's ongoing efforts to lean against inflation pressures.

            "content": "Speeches\nReflections on Four Decades in Central Banking\nJack Guynn\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nKiwanis Club of Atlanta\nLoudermilk Center\nAtlanta, Ga.\nAugust 22, 2006\nThank you for the nice introduction. But let me say that it feels strange to hear you describe my upcoming retirement. I guess I’m still coping with the reality that my\n42-year tenure at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is about to end.\nWhen I graduated from Virginia Tech back in the mid 1960s, I surprised my family and friends by taking a job with the Atlanta Fed. Before I left, some of my\nclassmates responded with a gag gift: a green eyeshade, like one of those visors tellers used to wear in old movies like “It’s a Wonderful Life.”\nMany of my college friends were going into more glamorous fields such as aerospace or computer design. And in their minds, I was condemned to life in a stodgy,\nbackwater industry. In that era it was thought you would choose one place to work and stay for your entire career.\nBut, as it turned out, the financial services industry and the U.S. economy went through a revolution. Technology, competition, and a growing demand for information\nwere catalysts for dramatic change. Certainly, this transformation made my career more interesting, and I expect even more change ahead.\nSo, you might ask, “What’s the big deal?” Well, I believe that banking’s shift from a low-tech field without competition into a dynamic industry had a profound impact on\nour personal and business lives and is a major part of our nation’s economic success. In describing these changes today, I’d also like to point to some potential\nconcerns for the next generation of policymakers.\nChanging how money is used\nLet me begin by talking briefly about what bankers call their “back office operations”—the payment systems that most people take for granted. In the 1960s, if you\npeeked inside the Fed or most commercial banks, you would have seen endless bundles of checks and cash being counted and sorted by hand. As you can imagine,\nthe process was inefficient.\nOften, it took three to five days or longer for a check to clear. During the high interest rate 1970s, folks would use this lag to their advantage through a practice we\ncalled “remote disbursement.”\nFor instance, oil companies were notorious for writing big checks to pay for Gulf of Mexico oilfield leases, and they used checks drawn on small banks in remote\nplaces such as North Dakota. With interest rates at 15 percent, each day’s delay in payment for a $50 million check was worth about $20,000. So receivers of these\nlarge checks sometimes would buy a plane ticket for a courier to physically take the piece of paper across the country to speed collection.\nAs more powerful technology became available we got busy and worked to improve the process. Not long after I started at the Fed, we realized that one computerdriven check sorter could do the work of 40 or 50 manual processors. Automated check processing became a classic application for emerging computer technology.\nAlso, instead of relying solely on trucks, the Fed began to charter airplanes to carry checks long distances overnight.\nComputers that made check processing more efficient also enabled new electronic payment systems such as the automated clearinghouse, which facilitates\ntransactions like direct deposit of payroll checks. During that period, credit cards also became more popular. With new methods of payment, the whiz kids of the\nbanking industry began to think that a checkless—even a cashless—society was imminent.\nBut it was not to be—at least not then. By speeding the collection of paper checks, the Fed may have delayed conversion to electronics. Also, regulations allowed\nbanks to demand presentment of a paper check for payment, which also discouraged change. So many banks and their customers did not enthusiastically embrace\nnew technology. In 2000 Americans were still writing 42 billion checks. And with the proliferation of automated teller machines, banks continued to circulate more—not\nless—cash.\nFinally, a few years ago, the volume of check payments began to decline about 4 percent per year—while electronic payments volume started to increase at\ndouble-digit rates. This transition continues as debit cards become more popular and businesses convert more and more check payments to electronic entries at the\npoint of sale. You may have seen some of those new types of electronic conversions on your own bank statement.\nLooking ahead, I believe there will always be a market for cash and checks. But today’s kids who are now growing up on video games no doubt will prefer the\nconvenience and speed of electronic payments. As money changes hands in new and faster ways, we face an evolving risk of fraud and identity theft. So consumers\nmust be vigilant in managing their accounts. And financial institutions must ensure that their payment systems operate on a solid foundation of trust, which is at the\nheart of a strong financial system.\nThe challenge of competition in banking\nTechnology has changed not only payment, but also the whole financial system and U.S. economy. Just think of the impact of the Internet and the advance of cellular\nand digital communications. This recent progress has helped businesses to work more efficiently and allowed emerging economies around the world to develop more\nquickly than we ever imagined. Globalization, by the way, has lessened the cost of many imported goods and boosted demand for U.S.-produced goods and services.\n\n\fAlong with technology, banking also has been transformed by competition. When I joined the Fed in the 1960s, banks were subject to rigid controls imposed by the\nstates and Congress during the Great Depression. The idea was to maintain financial stability by restricting competition—both geographically and along product lines.\nThere were strict limits on the interest banks could pay on savings deposits, and banks could not pay interest on transaction accounts. These restrictions were\nthought to prevent ruinous interest rate competition. The task of managing a bank balance sheet was largely a matter of following supervisory guidelines—green eye\nshade kind of work.\nMost states limited banks’ ability to branch outside their home county. And in some places branching was entirely prohibited. With near monopoly power in their\nrespective neighborhoods, banks had little incentive to grow or innovate. Hence, the cliché about bankers’ hours of 3-6-3—take in money from savings accounts at 3\npercent, lend it out at 6 percent, and hit the golf course by 3 o’clock.\nIn the 1980s, with high and rising inflation, the old regulatory framework began to unravel. Investment banks posed an early threat to the banking deposit franchise\nwith the introduction of money market accounts, which some of you may remember.\nTo compete, banks issued large denomination certificates of deposit, which were not subject to interest rate ceilings, thus significantly increasing their costs. As\nrestrictions on interest payments were lifted, more and more banks and thrifts got into trouble. We all remember the crisis in the savings and loan industry, which\nresulted in a bailout that was estimated to cost $175 billion.\nThe most difficult year in banking was 1988 when more than 200 banks failed. Earlier in that decade, I led our bank’s supervision function. I remember setting up what\nwe called “the war room” at the Atlanta Fed. This was a place to deal with the complex closure of a family of banks in Tennessee. In the final days of that crisis, we\nworked around the clock to find a buyer for the largest of these banks—unsuccessfully, it turned out. We ended up just closing the bank and hoping this failure\nwouldn’t lead to an old-fashioned bank panic.\nThe number of bank failures declined in the 1990s and has stayed low. Meanwhile, Congress continued to reform the regulatory framework. In turn, we saw the rise of\nwell-capitalized megabanks leveraging technology to cut costs and offering diverse and sometimes complex new products in competition with investment banks and\ninsurance companies. Now, it’s often hard to tell the difference between banks and nonbanks.\nThis competitive fray directly benefits today’s consumers and businesses, who enjoy lower-cost financial services, more choices and better access to capital. The\ngrowth of mutual funds has led to the rise of a new class of investors. Computers unleashed powerful innovations in credit scoring, and, with those new systems,\nsome borrowers can qualify for a loan in minutes, if not seconds. Innovations in credit analysis and market segmentation have helped millions of Americans become\nhomeowners.\nIf you want to buy a car, you can still get an old-fashioned two-year loan, but today you can also choose to make payments over eight or even 10 years. Along with\ntraditional fixed-rate mortgages, we now have adjustable rate mortgages, interest-only mortgages, reverse amortization mortgages, and more. And in today’s financial\nsupermarket, we also can find home equity loans, mutual funds, hedge funds and countless other ways to borrow or invest. With advances in information technology\nand mathematical modeling, today’s financial markets are better than ever at allocating risk to those with the greatest appetite for it.\nIs all of this competition a good thing? All in all, I’d say the answer is yes. However, sometimes I fret about some of the implications of our global connectedness and\nthe sheer size of some financial institutions and their new products. And I worry that some homeowners don’t really understand their new and not-yet-fully-tested\nmortgages.\nOverall, however, I believe our economy is much stronger and more resilient today because of the creative adjustments our financial sector has made in response to\nthe sometimes painful challenges of competition.\nThe economy in transition\nWhat are the lessons of technology, innovation and competition for our economy? During the mid-1960s, one-third of the jobs in the United States were in\nmanufacturing, and during the decades after World War II, there was not much global competition.\nNow, only one in nine U.S. jobs is in manufacturing, and most of the new factory jobs require technical skills. The fastest growing fields—financial services included\n—depend on knowledge, not physical labor.\nWe’ve all heard the sometimes bitter debate on outsourcing and immigration. However, our ports and logistics facilities overflow with low-cost goods from overseas.\nImports and exports—added up—are now equivalent to about one-fourth of gross domestic product. That figure 40 years ago was about 10 percent. Today’s economy\nis truly global.\nWe’re all aware of our current preoccupation with lost jobs to other parts of the world, both in manufacturing and the services sector. But looking at the data, you’ll see\nthree important facts. First, the majority of jobs lost involve relatively low-skilled, low-productivity work in fields like apparel production and call centers. Second, with\nrespect to manufacturing, while it’s true there are fewer factory jobs as a proportion of total U.S. employment, the U.S. share of the value of world manufacturing\noutput has remained stable, reflecting increases in worker productivity. Third, while it’s true that certain service-oriented jobs have moved to other countries, we still\nexport more services to the rest of the world than we import from others.\nWhat’s the bottom line of these changes in our economy? The march of globalization is relentless, and businesses will have to keep spending more on technology to\nimprove productivity. Technology allows consumers and businesses to compare prices from vendors around the world and find new and less expensive sources. And\ninnovations in supply-chain management reduce the inventory swings that used to be commonplace in our economy, helping to dampen the contribution of inventory\nadjustments to economic cycles.\nPainful lessons in monetary policy\nGood economic outcomes depend on good monetary policy, where I’ve spent the past 10 years of my career. Recent experience in this area offers several other\nlessons.\n\n\fIn the 1960s, economic growth was strong in part because of the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts and increased military and social spending. The Fed’s policy of leaning\nagainst inflationary pressures attracted little attention. But in the 1970s, policymakers tried to insulate the economy from relative price movements in one important\ncommodity—oil. The big mistake in this policy was the failure to recognize that controlling inflation was a necessary first requirement for sustaining long-term growth.\nAfter the 1970s oil price shocks, it became fashionable to embrace the false notion that one could improve economic outcomes by trading a bit of inflation for growth.\nAs we should now know, a bit of inflation can get out of hand quickly, especially when consumers and businesses expect more price increases, waste time and effort\ntrying to beat inflation, and then rush to spend more money in a vicious inflationary cycle. The consequences of high inflation were and remain economically\npoisonous: increased uncertainty and risk, the added incentive to consume instead of invest, cost of living adjustments, and other marketplace distortions.\nDuring the early 1980s, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and his Fed colleagues broke the back of high inflation by raising interest rates well into double digits. The costs\nwere huge—both in economic and human terms. The U.S. economy endured two painful recessions. And along with the run-up in bank failures that I just mentioned,\nentire industries such as homebuilding collapsed. Because of our tough policy, the Fed was suddenly thrust into the public limelight.\nBy 1996, when I became Atlanta Fed president and part of the Fed policymaking group, inflation expectations were, once again, under control. About that time, the\nfederal budget deficits were reined in. With the fortuitous convergence of low inflation and rapid growth, we enjoyed the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. In\nhindsight, I may have been naïve, but I thought that Americans had truly learned the value of responsible fiscal and monetary policy working in tandem to foster\neconomic growth for the long-term.\nThe last decade, under the leadership of former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, also brought about major changes in how the Federal Reserve communicates our\nmonetary policy actions and thinking. This transparency was and still is consistent with greater public scrutiny of the Fed and parallels the increase of financial\ninformation in the private sector that is central to today’s market-based approach to regulation.\nAs amazing as it may sound today, until 1994, there was no announcement about the direction of monetary policy—not even after Federal Open Market Committee\nmeetings. Market participants had to divine whether or not rates had changed by looking at conditions in money markets. This “quiet” (or silent) approach to\ncommunications gave rise to a cottage industry of “Fed watchers” who were devoted to interpreting our policy actions and likely policy direction.\nNow, after each FOMC meeting, we not only announce our action but also provide brief comments on the economy and potential risks to the outlook. For the last\nthree years, we have even tried to signal the likely path of policy—in my view, an approach that’s worked well during this particular period.\nOur new Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, has talked about the need to make our policy goals even clearer. Minutes of our recent FOMC meetings indicate that the Fed\nis studying and debating the limits to what we should say about the outlook and possible future policy actions. My Fed colleagues and I have found that market\nreactions to our Fed comments can be surprising. And, in an environment of seemingly endless data reports, it’s sometimes hard in the short run to distinguish\nmeaningful economic signals from noise.\nThis thinking about transparency will evolve. And I expect the Fed will keep trying new and different ways to communicate important views and actions, including\nperhaps establishing targets for acceptable levels of inflation. Clearly, more central bank communications are helpful, but there is ample room to debate how to reflect\nthe range of views and uncertainties that are inherent in the policymaking process.\nAn interconnected world\nWhile I’ve tried to make the case that our financial system and economy have gone through revolutionary changes in the past 40 years, I want to leave you with the\nnotion that things will keep getting more complex and more interesting.\nFrom a payments perspective, our vision of an efficient, predominately electronic system is in sight. There will be fewer and bigger banks, and competition will keep\naltering our financial marketplace. We will all face more potential risks and rewards as the selection of financial products continues to multiply.\nOur financial system and our economy will continue to become more interconnected. Every moment of every day, vast sums of money zip around the world. Nine\nyears ago a financial panic in Asia quickly led to financial market repercussions around the world. And with the emergence of China and India and increasing U.S.\nindebtedness, the global flow of funds will continue to grow, and our economy will depend more and more on events and decisions that occur outside our national\nborders.\nMonetary policymakers must continue to account for all of these changes and others we can’t envision as technology advances and shocks occur. We’ve been\nreminded over and over how adaptable and resilient our U.S. financial system and economy are, and no doubt we’ll be tested again. I’m leaving the FOMC confident\nin the Fed’s commitment to keep inflation at bay. I’m sure future policymakers will remember the lessons we learned in the past 40 years about what happens when\nyou start down the slippery slope of trading inflation for growth.\nI wish my college buddies who gave me the green eye shade were here with us today. Contrary to what they might have expected, my experience as a central banker\nhas been fascinating and, at times, downright exciting.\nFor a long time, I’ve enjoyed an up close and personal view on banking and the economy, and pretty soon I’ll be watching from the bleachers. Looking ahead to the\nnext four decades, I think we all have good reason to expect our financial system and our economy will remain strong and continue to be the envy of the rest of the\nworld.\n\nCONTACTS\nJean Tate\n404-498-8035\n\n\fRELATED LINKS\nPress release\nRelated Links on Other Sites\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nFederal Reserve Financial Services\n\n\f"

            "content": "Speeches\nAdjusting to the Next Stage of the Housing Cycle\nJack Guynn\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nCouncil for Quality Growth\nAtlanta, Ga.\nJune 7, 2006\nIt’s nice to be invited back here. I last spoke to your group in April 2001, and at that time I focused my remarks on the sudden decline in economic growth we were\nseeing, a slowdown that turned out to be our last recession. Now, five years later, we’re moving into the fourth year of an economic expansion. As policymakers and\nbusiness and community leaders, we’re all continuing to try to evaluate the economic forces that are currently at work and what they may suggest for both the local\nand national economies as well as for monetary policy over the period ahead.\nMy guess is you’re looking for me to offer my view of the U.S. economic outlook and how monetary policy might be expected to respond. Over the next few minutes, I\nwill take some time to provide you with my thoughts on those issues. But I also want to devote part of my remarks to housing, which has been an important driver of\neconomic activity during and after the last recession. I know many of you in this room have a stake in the housing business, and the subject is especially important\nand fascinating to many of us here in the Atlanta area, where we’ve seen so much population growth and new home construction.\nRecent economic experience\nHousing, of course, depends very much on underlying economic and demographic fundamentals. So let me begin by providing you with a look at the current\neconomic climate. Some of us may fondly remember the 1990s, a decade that brought us the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. Between 1993 and 2000,\nthe U.S. economy created an average of nearly 3 million jobs per year. And our broadest measure of economic activity, gross domestic product (GDP), grew at an\nannual rate of more than 3½ percent during that seven-year period.\nSince the economic downturn in 2001, we’ve been through terrorist attacks, two wars, and rising energy prices. Yet, even with these and other economic shocks, it’s\neasy to overlook that our recent economic performance compares well to the late 1990s. Since 2003, we’ve had average GDP growth of about 3¾ percent, and our\nexpansion is getting support from almost all economic sectors. Since job growth turned positive in late 2003, the U.S. economy has added nearly 5 million jobs.\nOver the past three years, consumer spending has been very strong. Business profits have grown on average 16 percent per year, and spending on equipment and\nsoftware has averaged about 11 percent. Government spending also has contributed to growth. I don’t want to spend time today discussing our nation’s federal deficit,\nbut the long-term outlook for government spending is, in my view, worrisome. Finally, residential investment between 2003 and 2005 was exceptionally strong.\nBut even as I think good growth will likely continue, I think it’s also reasonable to expect adjustments in some sectors. In the first quarter of this year, you’ll recall we\nhad GDP growth of almost 5½ percent. After our May 10, 2006, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, we issued a statement that anticipated \"growth as\nlikely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.\" Personally, I agree with that consensus outlook, and I think the new data suggests we are beginning to see the\nexpected moderation.\nPart of this moderation in growth is coming from some easing in the extraordinary pace of home construction, sales, and price appreciation—a development we’ve\nbeen expecting for some time. Don’t get me wrong. I do not expect a sharp residential real estate correction, but I believe we should recognize that a slowdown in\nhousing activity is very likely—and may have begun already.\nFactors behind the housing boom\nWe’re fortunate to live in a country with a housing stock that offers great selection and affordability. The rate of homeownership in this country has climbed toward 70\npercent—near-record levels. For most of us, our home is our most valuable asset. In a certain sense, housing is part of our economic DNA.\nAs I suggested a moment ago, the demand for housing depends on underlying demographic trends and the overall economic climate. For the past 15 years, the sale\nof new homes has climbed steadily. Since 2000, residential investment increased at an average annualized quarterly growth rate of 5½ percent and increased slightly\neven during the 2001 recession.\nClearly, a major contributor to increased housing activity in recent years has been the low cost of mortgage credit, which is influenced by the fed funds target rate.\nFrom 2002 to 2004, the Fed kept short-term interest rates very low, at or just above 1 percent. But even after the FOMC began raising short-term rates two years ago,\nmortgage rates stayed low and are still less than 7 percent, which by historical standards is relatively low.\nIn addition to the attractiveness of interest rates, the financial services industry in the past decade has introduced a wide range of new mortgage options with the\npotential to increase buying power. For instance, we’ve seen the emergence of high loan-to-value mortgages, subprime mortgages, interest-only mortgages,\npay-option mortgages, and most recently 40-year and even 50-year mortgages. These so-called affordability products allow borrowers to qualify for a first home or a\nmore expensive home they couldn’t have otherwise purchased.\nDemographics also have played a big role in the patterns of recent home purchases. Recently, the oldest of some 70 million baby boomers began to reach retirement\nage—a trend that’s no doubt boosted the demand for second homes. The market for vacation homes on the waterfront has been especially active. To illustrate the\ndimensions of the second-home phenomenon, in 2000 about 7 to 8 percent of mortgage-financed home purchases were not owner-occupied. In 2004, the percent of\nnon-owner-occupied homes purchased and financed (including investment and vacation homes) had more than doubled to almost 16 percent of all home sales.\nIncluded in the non-owner-occupied homes data I just gave you are a large number of investment purchases, as many investors who left the stock market after its\n\n\fadjustment a few years ago turned to real estate as a vehicle for greater appreciation. I suspect some of you in this room have bought condos or vacation properties\nstrictly as investments, counting on strong price appreciation to provide you the opportunity to “flip” the properties for a nice gain. For many seasoned and novice\ninvestors alike, that approach for the past few years has been profitable.\nNationally, home prices appreciated 13 percent in 2005, and that strong performance followed a similar rate of growth in 2004. Going back a bit further, national home\nprice appreciation from 2000 to 2003 each year averaged about 7½ percent, better than in the 1990s. By most any measure—price appreciation, home sales,\nconstruction, you name it—2005 was a great year for housing.\nImplications of an adjustment in housing\nSo, now that we’re in the fifth year of a housing boom, can we expect this extraordinary performance to continue? In my view, probably not. And I say that because\nwhat we’ve been experiencing was driven by a confluence of the special circumstances that I described earlier.\nAlong with somewhat higher mortgage rates, the inventory of unsold new single-family homes has increased steadily to nearly six months at current sales rates.\nRecently, I’ve heard reports of investors dumping properties for which they had contracted but not yet closed, especially in some coastal markets that were so\nattractive for many years. And I’ve heard more stories of potential buyers “waiting out” sellers because they believe prices are likely to keep falling. All of these\ndevelopments have contributed to a slowing of house price appreciation—depending of course on the location.\nIn my 42 years at the Fed, I’ve seen a few real estate cycles, and I’m sure others here remember some of those ups and downs in the housing market. Having lived\nthrough those times, I can point to some concerns that I believe warrant attention.\nFor instance, the mortgage credit innovations that have made homes more affordable to buyers, at least, in the short run, have not been fully tested in a period of\nrising interest rates and a moderating economy. I suspect—based on what I’ve heard from anecdotal reports—that lenders and borrowers have not always asked all\nthe “what if” questions that are basic to risk management. It’s quite likely that some borrowers will have a hard time handling their payments in different\ncircumstances. To underscore these concerns, the banking regulators, including the Fed, has circulated “Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Products”\nto remind bank lenders of these risks.\nAnd there are the housing speculators. It’s probably fair to assume that many of those speculators include high-wealth individuals who can afford the risk of potential\nprice adjustment. But other less sophisticated investors may get stuck with properties they can’t sell for a decent profit or even have to unload at a loss. Those\ninvestors who may never have intended to close on their purchases may have to walk away from deposits for properties in developments that only a few months ago\nappeared to be “nearly sold out.” In hindsight, some speculators may wish they had paid closer heed to some pretty obvious warning signs such as the emergence of\nWeb sites designed strictly for “condo flippers.”\nFinally, and in some ways most basically, there’s the still unanswered question of how developers, builders, and lenders will respond to an adjustment in housing\nactivity—if, in fact, that’s what is under way. I remember a longtime Fed policymaker—a veteran observer of housing cycles—used to describe the housing industry as\na big group of independent thinkers. Regardless of the warning signs, he observed that each developer, builder, or lender would decide there’s room enough for one\nmore project—his or her project, of course. At the same time, dozens of others in the same business in the same markets were making the same decisions. I tell this\nstory not because I feel qualified to offer advice on how to run a residential development business but rather as commentary on how our market economy works.\nI don’t pretend for one minute to be able to judge the condition of your individual housing markets—nor do I know what special factors will influence future housing\nactivity in each area. Instead, I’m closely watching the larger housing market across our region and nation with the goal of understanding how developments in the\nresidential business shape the larger economy and Fed policy.\nAnd let me say that on a macro level I believe the housing adjustment most likely will be orderly and with a limited impact on the overall economy. I say this for a\nnumber of reasons. For one thing, depository institutions in the United States are well capitalized and hence well positioned to absorb any housing lending losses they\nmay incur. Also, it’s worth mentioning recent changes with respect to capital markets and mortgage finance. More and more of the credit- and interest-rate-related\nrisks associated with mortgage finance can be easily traded and have gravitated to those institutions best positioned to manage the risks. Today more than half of the\nnation’s $9 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding is securitized.\nIt’s also true that many jobs depend on home-related construction and mortgage businesses, and important industries in our regional economy such as durable goods\nand carpet production also rely on housing construction. But even if there were no growth in housing construction, the level is high enough now to support strong\nongoing demand for home products and related goods. Furthermore, consumers will continue to remodel existing homes and replace worn-out appliances and\nfurniture. Looking at the broader context of our diverse and dynamic economy, direct residential investment is only about 6 percent of GDP.\nFinally, a slowdown in house price appreciation could affect consumer spending. For example, higher interest rates have deterred refinancing and extraction of home\nequity for other spending. For several years during the era of low interest rates, cash-strapped consumers used their homes like ATMs. But, as home price escalation\nslows, consumers can be expected to feel less confident about gains in wealth and may well begin to feel inclined to save more and spend less. These indirect effects\nof a housing slowdown are embedded in my forecast of some slowing in the growth of consumer spending.\nEvaluating monetary policy\nWith that digression on the housing business, let me return to my own beat—monetary policy. I was trained as industrial engineer, and I spent some of my early years\nworking to develop banking technology. That was a pretty straightforward business where you could often use formulas to get very specific answers to key questions.\nBut with monetary policy making, I find that answers are more often in shades of gray instead of black and white. When it comes to monetary policy, uncertainty and\nforecast “error bands” are a fact of our business.\nCongress has given the Fed a so-called dual mandate—to use monetary policy to help achieve sustainable growth but also to help achieve price stability, another\nterm for low and steady inflation. As policymakers, we make our best forecast of growth and inflation over the coming quarters, then choose a fed funds setting that\nwe think is most likely to nudge the economy in the desired direction, with the realization that our policy actions impact the economy with a lag. As my earlier\ndiscussion would suggest, we are shooting at a moving target as various new developments affect the economy in different ways.\nI have already talked about some factors—including a housing adjustment—that are likely to contribute to the moderation in the rate of growth we expect. I have not\n\n\fyet talked about the outlook for our second objective: inflation. There are many factors at any time that work either to hold down price pressures or add to the inflation\nrisks we’ve noted in recent FOMC statements.\nHeadline measures of inflation of late have been bothersome, with higher oil prices contributing to much of the run-up in those broad readings. Core inflation, which\nexcludes volatile food and energy costs, has moved into the upper end of—or beyond—the range I consider acceptable over time. Global competitive forces and good\nU.S. productivity growth should help to ease further upward movement in inflation, and we may get some relief from stabilizing or possibly falling energy prices over\ntime.\nStill, I view current inflation risks to be elevated for three reasons. First, we have been expecting and have not yet seen secondary pass-through of energy prices to\ncore inflation. Secondly, some key components of core inflation such as services have been moving at rates that warrant continued concern. Finally, some measures\nof inflation expectations recently have edged upward.\nIf we’re on target with our present forecast for growth to moderate to a sustainable pace and for inflation to fall back within acceptable bounds, I would say that\nmonetary policy is now close to where it should be. But, as I have already suggested, the FOMC’s job is to continue to update that outlook as we get new data and\nanecdotal information. So we have to remain open to rethinking our policy setting as that outlook changes. One of the challenges of this process is interpreting new\ndata and distinguishing between transitory factors—or, in other words, “noise”—and the more significant underlying trends.\nOn June 28, I will be among the 19 members of the FOMC, including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who will gather around the table in Washington to consider what\nwe’ve learned since our last FOMC meeting. During our discussions, we take account of the analysis by our respective teams of professional economists, and we will\nexchange anecdotal information gathered from business and community contacts around the country. After taking account of new information and adjusting our\nforecasts if that is called for, we will vote on how to set our fed funds target rate to match that updated outlook.\nPutting it all together\nIn summary, I have tried to paint a picture of an economy that has performed quite well over the last four years, and one that I expect will continue to grow while\nmoderating to a more sustainable pace. And I have tried to get you to think with me about the particular contribution of housing to recent economic growth, and the\nadjustment that may be taking place as this economic expansion continues.\nDuring the past five years since I last spoke here, our economy has been tested on numerous occasions. No one can predict the surprises the next five years will\nbring. But we should remember that our economy had demonstrated amazing resilience. Today—even with the inevitable adjustments we face—the economy is on a\nsolid footing, and the Fed remains committed to its mission to foster an economic climate where inflation and inflation expectations are low and stable.\n\nCONTACTS\nJean Tate\n404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS\nCouncil for Quality Growth\nFederal Reserve Board: Monetary Policy\nPress release\n\n\f"

            "content": "Speeches\nNearing a Sustainable Balance of Economic Growth\nJack Guynn\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nWildhorse Saloon\nNashville, Tenn.\nMay 1, 2006\nIt’s a pleasure to be back in Nashville. The last time I spoke here, my colleagues gave me a pretty rough time about speaking at some place called the Wildhorse\nSaloon. Who knows what they imagined about this audience? But I assured them I was honoring a request to speak to the top business and civic leaders of Nashville,\nwhich of course was and still is the case.\nAnd let me add that Paula Lovell has been a terrific representative of your community in her work with us at the Atlanta Fed. For more than 10 and a half years\nserving on both the Nashville and Atlanta boards and as our 2003 chairman of the Atlanta board, she brought us invaluable grassroots insights on the local and\nnational economies. Her perspective—and the views from other business and community leaders who serve as Fed directors across the country—are vital to our\nmonetary policymaking process. So, Paula, thank you again for all the time you spent with us.\nIt’s been four years since I spoke to your group, and over that time, our economy has seen pretty dramatic changes—and challenges. My intent today is to not only\ndescribe an economy that continues to show solid growth and momentum but also to talk about some of the uncertainties and risks that all of us—as business leaders\nand policymakers—need to follow and understand.\nEconomic activity strong\nJust last Friday, we got our first official measure of overall economic activity in the first quarter of this year. The advance estimate of gross domestic product (GDP),\nwhich is our broadest and most familiar measure of economic output, came in at 4.8 percent. That strong reading confirms our sense that the weakness in GDP\ngrowth in the last quarter of 2005 was not a turning point. As it turned out, slowdowns in auto sales and government spending and some loss of activity following\nHurricane Katrina were just temporary factors.\nIn evaluating the path of the U.S. economy, it’s more telling to realize that we are now in the fifth year of this economic expansion, with annual GDP growth averaging\nclose to 4 percent over the past three years. In fact today’s performance compares favorably to the long expansion of the 1990s.\nWhile it’s always helpful to reflect on the past, it’s more important—and challenging—to look ahead to the rest of 2006 and beyond. In my remarks to other groups\nover the last few months, I have said that I expect the period ahead to bring us continued solid growth and favorable inflation experience. And that’s still my outlook.\nBut, as I indicated earlier, there are some significant uncertainties that could shape our economic outlook and help to inform how Fed policy should evolve.\nLet me elaborate. I like to begin my analysis of the economy with a look at consumer and household spending, which represents about two-thirds of GDP. Consumer\nspending has grown steadily and was strong again for the first quarter of this year. And this performance was achieved in spite of somewhat higher interest rates and\nthe drag from higher energy prices—a point I’ll return to in a moment. But these headwinds were buffered by strong growth in employment and personal income,\nwhich has helped to bolster consumer spending.\nDuring the first quarter, the monthly average for new job creation was nearly 200,000. That rate of hiring is strong and follows nearly 4½ million new jobs created in\n2004 and 2005. The unemployment rate in March declined to 4.7 percent, a relatively low level by historical standards. And recent unemployment claims data and\nsurveys of business hiring plans suggest good job growth should continue. In contrast to a few years ago, when people were concerned about a jobless recovery,\nsome employers are now having a hard time filling many skilled jobs.\nThere are other important contributors to growth, such as business spending. While this category accounts for only about 10 percent of GDP, it serves as an important\ncontributor to both gains in productivity and employment. You’ll recall the collapse of business spending was a big factor in the 2001 recession. But in recent years\nbusiness spending has been strong and after a bit of a lull late last year recovered in the first quarter of this year with a gain of more than 14 percent. Growth in new\norders for durable goods this year has been especially notable.\nIn today’s climate of strong aggregate demand and worldwide growth, businesses have not only the will but also the means to finance aggressive capital spending.\nCorporate profits increased more than 16 percent in 2005, following gains during the prior year of more than 12 percent. Also, financial markets are still relatively\naccommodative—despite some recent upward movement in longer-term interest rates—so the business climate is very supportive for capital spending.\nEvaluating uncertainties, including housing\nWhile the outlook is favorable, I want to point out several risks that could materially affect how the economy evolves. For the next few moments, I’d like to talk about\nsome of these risks, starting with the much-anticipated adjustments in residential real estate.\nLast year was a record one for housing construction, sales, and price appreciation. In fact, for the past few years, housing activity has been supported by low\nmortgage rates, job growth, and strong demand. But in recent months, there is growing evidence of a cooling in many housing markets across the country.\nIn some of the hottest coastal markets in the Southeast, I’ve heard of sharp adjustments and sudden reversals of the frenzied speculation we saw earlier, with prices\nfalling sharply in some of those markets. Some projects have been canceled, and I’ve heard more reports of standoffs between buyers and sellers as buyers wait for\nprices to adjust further.\n\n\fClearly, higher mortgage rates, while still historically low, have muted housing activity. In most markets, home sales are still relatively strong, but not strong enough to\nkeep pace with properties coming on the market. So the inventory of unsold homes has climbed steadily to about 5½ months’ supply at the current sales pace.\nLooking ahead, continued job growth and underlying demographics suggest the underpinning for housing over the longer term is solid. But the market is changing,\nand the impact of the housing adjustment on overall economic activity is not yet fully evident. Some slowdown in housing is built into almost everyone’s forecast. But\nhousing could turn out—once again—to be more resilient than expected, or the adjustment could turn out to be more extensive than anticipated.\nWhat’s also vexing for observers of housing is that longer-term interest rates have not responded to steady increases in short-term rates the way they have in the\npast. A number of explanations have been offered for the nontraditional behavior of short- vs. long-term interest rates, but it is yet to be seen whether this worldwide\ndevelopment will persist.\nI can’t help but recall other unusual developments a few years ago that were described as a \"new economy,\" suggesting some fundamental economic principles had\nchanged permanently. In hindsight, we now know that historical relationships prevailed. I won’t venture to predict the ultimate resolution of the short-term/long-term\ninterest rate conundrum, but my staff is continuing to research the economic implications of a return to more familiar patterns with higher long-term interest rates.\nAdjusting to energy costs\nSince we’re on the subject of uncertainties, let me also share my thoughts on energy prices. The last time I was here, four years ago, oil cost about $20 a barrel. In\nfact, despite volatility in energy prices, we used to think that oil would settle back over time to around $25–$30 a barrel.\nBut our experience for the past two years has changed that expectation, at least in the view of futures markets. With oil prices persistently above $70 a barrel,\nhouseholds and businesses face new costs that must be absorbed, offset, or passed along if possible. Although difficult to measure, these higher energy costs have\nforced households to reallocate spending and could dampen consumer spending in the future.\nAt the same time, because of elevated energy prices, businesses face intense pressure to cut their other costs, raise prices, or both, depending on the circumstances.\nWhile energy is increasingly cited as a justification for price increases, many businesses—especially goods producers—can’t or won’t pass along higher costs. In part,\nthat’s because global competition helps keep prices down and thus induces businesses to improve efficiency to maintain profits. The result is higher productivity,\nwhich helps to offset increased costs, including energy.\nManufacturing and globalization\nThis trend is quite evident in manufacturing, which as you know is an important sector in middle Tennessee with the auto industry nearby. Much has been written\nabout the supposed demise of U.S. factories. Yes, we have lost some four million manufacturing jobs in the past 15 years, and many of those lower-skilled jobs have\nmoved overseas.\nPeople are quick to blame globalization for painful adjustments in nondurable manufacturing industries such as apparel, where overseas makers have the advantage\nof lower labor costs. But you may find it surprising that, even with many factories shedding low-skilled jobs, manufacturing output in the United States is growing at\nabout the same pace as the overall economy—even faster for makers of information technology equipment, aircraft, and other high-quality durables where skilled\nlabor and technology are a necessary part of the process.\nIn fact, the United States remains the largest producer of manufactured goods in the world—bigger than even China or Japan. And the total employment in\nmanufacturing is still an important part of the U.S. employment base, with some 14 million workers still employed in manufacturing, or about 13 percent of the total\nwork force. Even as less-productive manufacturing jobs go away, the total wage bill in manufacturing is increasing as managers bid up wages for high-quality,\ntechnically skilled workers.\nKeeping an eye on inflation\nBidding up wages prompts me to consider another factor that’s critical for our central bank mission. As monetary policymakers, our challenge is twofold: to provide a\nclimate that is conducive to sustainable GDP growth and to create a financial environment that should sustain low and stable prices.\nOver the years, we’ve learned hard and painful lessons—both in the United States and elsewhere—about the disruptive and destabilizing nature of rising and\nunstable inflation. Even more insidious at times has been the emergence of expectations of rising inflation, which leads to all sorts of irrational and unproductive\nmarketplace decisions. Some of you with gray hair like mine may recall the high inflation of the 1970s and the double-digit mortgage rates many of us carried.\nTrust me, we don’t want to go there again—and the Fed is firmly committed to resisting unwelcome rises in inflation. My colleagues and I place a very high value on\nFed credibility in the fight against inflation, which was earned through steadfast actions to ensure price stability. Part of our job is to adjust monetary policy as needed\nto achieve that objective and to explain our actions in ways that inspire public confidence in our determination to lean against conditions that could lead to the\nincrease of inflation expectations.\nLet’s talk about our recent inflation experience. For the first three months of 2006, the familiar and frequently cited consumer price index (CPI) has increased at an\nannual rate of 4.3 percent. This number includes food and energy prices and is a significant increase from 2005 CPI growth of 3.4 percent. As I said earlier, a major\nfactor in this unwelcome rise in overall inflation is, of course, energy, which has a direct bearing on the price of gasoline and natural gas, among other vital commodity\ninputs.\nThe core measures of inflation, excluding food and energy, have been less volatile. Core CPI was 2.8 percent for the first three months of 2006, and another measure\nwe often use, core personal consumption expenditures, or core PCE, was about 2 percent measured on a year-over-year basis. On the other hand, three- and\nsix-month measures have edged up recently. While these measures are still relatively low, I don’t want to see inflation move measurably higher.\nLately, my staff and I have pored through reams of data and talked to many business contacts to try to determine the extent of energy cost pass-through. We’re\nfinding the impact on transportation costs is large, and the spillover effect of higher energy costs affects various industries in different ways.\nFor instance, as I mentioned earlier, most goods producers have found offsets for energy price increases. Productivity improvements have been less of a factor for\nservice providers, such as accountants or medical professionals, and so price increases have shown through more in the services sector than in the goods sector.\n\n\fWhile there’s every reason to believe that competitive pressures will remain a major factor in the global marketplace, we don’t know how long and how extensively\nthese forces will continue to mute overall price increases.\nConsidering monetary policy\nI want to spend my last few minutes giving you my personal thoughts on the question, What’s the likely path for future Fed policy? As you know, the Fed has been\nsteadily raising short-term interest rates since June 2004. Over this nearly two-year period, there have been 15 rate increases, taking the Fed funds target rate to its\ncurrent 4¾ percent. We have been able to stay on this steady and well-anticipated policy path as the economy has maintained momentum.\nWith demand increasing for several years, recent surveys suggest that wage gains are now becoming more widespread. While I think it’s important to watch for cost\npressures from wages, I’m not among those who subscribe to the theory that a certain level of low unemployment triggers an outbreak of wage-induced inflation. In\nfact, our experience from the 1990s and more recently tells us that there’s little if any measurable correlation between tight labor markets and inflation.\nWhen calibrating monetary policy, the Fed takes account of various risks to its baseline forecasts. Over the period ahead, as the full effects of the sequence of\nmonetary policy moves plays out, I expect that output growth will settle on a path that is somewhat below what we saw in the first quarter of this year, probably\ngrowing at close to the economy’s potential. I believe that monetary policy adjustments that have already been made, along with other factors such as continuing\nproductivity improvements, should also help to contain elevated inflation pressures.\nIf—and I emphasize if—my most likely forecast of sustainable output growth and modest inflation is right, then I am of the view that we are very close to having Fed\npolicy properly calibrated for now. At the same time, we are at a point that requires careful analysis of new economic data, especially data that might signal an uptick\nof inflation or increase in inflation expectations that would affect our projections for the likely course for the economy. And I will also give particular weight to the\nforward-looking anecdotal information we get from our many contacts—the Paula Lovells of the world, who help to keep us in touch with the real world of business\ndecisions.\nDuring the last four years, our economy has evolved in unexpected ways and has been more stable than some might have predicted. I expect the next four years will\nbe no less fascinating. One of the lessons we’ve learned—or at least relearned—is that surprises are inevitable. We can’t know the shock of the next hurricane,\nterrorist attack, or political crisis in an oil-producing region. Layered on top of these potential shocks are the risks I’ve just described: potential adjustments in housing,\nunknown consequences of high and volatile energy prices, and unprecedented global capital flows, among other uncertainties. Given the wide range of possibilities\nahead, I believe this is not a time for the Fed to precommit to a particular course of policy.\nBut the U.S. economy is flexible and resilient, and most of what we know suggests the outlook is positive. So today I believe that growth is on track. And furthermore I\nknow—and I hope you know—that the Fed is committed to keeping inflation and inflation expectations anchored for the long term.\n\nCONTACTS\nJean Tate\n404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nPress Release\nSpeakers Bureau\n\n\f"

            "content": "Speeches\nNurturing Sustainable Growth in a Global Context\nJack Guynn\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAtlanta History Center\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMarch 15, 2006\nIt’s a pleasure to be here this evening for the opening of “Old Money, New Money: The Rise of Southern Capitalism.” First, let me say that I’m delighted that the\nAtlanta Fed is working with the Atlanta History Center to tell the story of money from a Southern perspective.\nWe’ve all heard references to “old money” and “new money,” but in my experience people have a profound emotional connection to any kind of money that’s best\nsummed up in the overused movie line, “Show me the money.” In fact, I can tell you that folks get pretty excited touring the Money Museum at our Fed office in\nMidtown, where you can see things like an uncut sheet of $100,000 bills (never in circulation), a solid gold bar, and millions of dollars in cold, hard cash. Unless I miss\nmy guess, Atlanta History Center visitors will appreciate the hard work and energy that have gone into the fascinating new exhibit we’re celebrating here tonight.\nReflecting on your theme of money and Southern capitalism, our region has undergone a dramatic evolution from a mostly agrarian economy to a low-wage\nmanufacturing economy and then into today’s multidimensional mix of businesses that generally mirrors the broader U.S. economy. This evening, I thought I would try\nto add some context to this exhibit by offering my own view on the current national economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy. I expect many of you\nmay share my sense that—despite a lot of positives that I want to talk about—our economy is going through a very turbulent time. I’m going to suggest that some of\nthat turbulence is related to the forces of globalization—powerful but not fully understood developments that are reshaping our economy in ways that are both exciting\nand sometimes unsettling.\nFirst, I’d like to begin with an overview of the current economy. Right now, the United States is in the fourth year of a solid and sustained economic expansion. Until\nthe fourth quarter of 2005, we had 10 straight quarters of gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3 percent or more. Since the beginning of 2004, the U.S. economy\nhas created nearly 4.5 million jobs, averaging about 173,000 new jobs a month. Core inflation, putting aside the volatile food and energy components, has remained\nrelatively low and stable, and, importantly, expectations for future inflation remain “well anchored,” as monetary policymakers say. So, by those basic measures, the\nU.S. economy is doing quite well, and I believe it’s also noteworthy that our economy has adjusted to the current period of rapid economic change in some new and\nsurprising ways.\nBut before I proceed with my outlook, I need to reconcile the latest reading of GDP, our broadest measure of economic output. As you may recall, GDP grew at only\nabout 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter last year—about half the pace of the previous 2 ½ years. The analysis done by my staff and others suggests this relatively\nweak reading was an aberration that does not imply a loss of momentum going forward. And I agree with this assessment. Part of the slowdown at the end of last year\nwas because of auto and truck sales, which were soft in October and quite weak in November following a round of earlier incentive-led sales. But vehicle sales picked\nup in December, January, and February. Other consumer spending has been well maintained, and retail sales this quarter seem to be on a solid pace. Also in the\nfourth quarter, government spending declined sharply, but I don’t know anyone who’s ready to declare the start of a new era of fiscal discipline. In fact, the large and\nworrisome fiscal deficit seems certain to worsen not far down the road as the baby boomers begin to retire.\nAs we evaluate today’s economy, business spending remains strong. A prevailing theme for the past few years has been the quest for efficiency, and I see the trend\nof productivity enhancements continuing with intense global competitive pressures, which I’ll discuss more in a few moments. Today’s computer equipment, for\ninstance, depreciates more quickly than ever. So, technological advancements lead to more spending on information technology equipment and software, and that\npattern seems to be continuing.\nTaking into account these positive observations, private forecasts predict first quarter GDP growth of more than 4 percent. Looking beyond the current quarter, the\nfundamentals for continued growth appear to be in place. While we may not have seen the full adjustment in spending by businesses and households in the face of\npersistently higher energy costs, so far spending has not been significantly curtailed. In addition, the much-anticipated slowdown in housing activity appears to be\nplaying out in an orderly way.\nAnother important contribution to economic growth has been employment. Last year, more than 2 million jobs were added, making 2005 the best year for hiring since\n2000. Those new jobs, and the new income they provide, are vital to future growth in household spending. The unemployment rate is a very low 4.8 percent. In fact,\nthere is growing concern about a shortage of skilled workers, especially in fields such as health care, finance, accounting and construction. But, even in tighter labor\nmarkets, I’m inclined to believe that with management ingenuity and the flexibility afforded by immigrant labor, businesses will continue to add new jobs over the\nmonths ahead at a pace similar to last year.\nIn judging the outlook for the economy, no central banker would focus on GDP and employment growth without taking into account inflation and inflation expectations.\nOur recent economic history clearly tells us that low and stable inflation—and expectations of ongoing price stability—are necessary preconditions for sustained\neconomic growth and employment. We learned some tough lessons in the high-inflation period of the late 1960s and the 1970s, when some policymakers believed\nthat by allowing inflation to creep higher we would get more growth and employment. But now we know from both experience and from a vast body of academic\nresearch that the costs of rising and unstable inflation far outweigh the benefits.\nAs I said earlier, we’ve been enjoying an extended period of generally low and stable core inflation. Of course, there have been some spikes in overall headline\ninflation measures that are primarily related to wide month-to-month swings in energy prices. Having characterized the recent inflation experience as generally\nfavorable, I think it’s important to note that core measures of inflation in 2004 and early 2005 started drifting upward to around 2 percent—still moderate, but at the\nupper bound of what I would like to see over the long run.\n\n\fIn many ways, our recent inflation experiences have defied precedent. Higher energy prices have put significant pressure on businesses to raise prices. And we’ve\nseen many examples of pass-through of some costs in the form of energy surcharges. In addition, for more than a year, many of my business contacts have told me\nof plans to increase prices, and, in some cases, they’ve already made price increases stick. Yet, overall measures of inflation tell us that somewhere in the production\nchain many businesses have chosen to absorb significant input cost increases. Despite the factors that have helped to contain large inflation increases during the\nrecent period, I share the notion conveyed in our last postmeeting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement that “possible increases in resource utilization\nas well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.”\nUnderstanding globalization\nA major factor permeating most every aspect of the economic outlook is globalization, which I mentioned earlier. The term has been in our vocabulary for a while now,\nbut its usage seems to have accelerated lately. If you search on Google for “globalization,” you’ll find more than 100 million references. Not everyone welcomes\nglobalization, but it’s a fact of life in this day and age. In fact, the market dynamics underlying globalization have been with us for some time and have played a key\nrole in the economic development of the South featured in the History Center’s new exhibit.\nThink about some recent global developments and their possible implications. Clearly, strong growth in India and China has contributed to higher energy usage and\nelevated energy costs, which have shown through in higher measured headline inflation. Also, millions of new workers who have been brought into competitive\nmarkets—from Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere—have changed the dynamics of employment and put downward pressure on labor costs, both\nhere and abroad. And more competitive global labor markets are forcing U.S. companies to rethink some costly employee benefits, including health care and\npensions. The upside is that U.S. consumers have benefited through lower prices for many goods that are now being imported. But, whether we like it or not, the\neffects of a more global economy are inescapable; economic events in distant places have a profound impact close to home.\nToday, dramatic changes can occur at the speed of a mouse click, with financial markets bustling nonstop and vast sums of capital zipping around the world, every\nmoment of every day.\nBut globalization involves both challenges and opportunities, often in tandem. Here in Georgia, for instance, an overseas business just this week committed significant\ninvestment to build a highly productive new automobile manufacturing facility. Some new jobs will be added, but at the same time older and more labor-intensive\nautomobile factories in the area (that happened to be owned by domestic automakers) will soon begin to shut down.\nMoreover, global capital flows are having an increasingly important impact on our current economic climate. For example, we have not yet fully explained the\nlong-term interest rate “conundrum” described last year by former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. Longer-term interest rates have remained stubbornly low, despite\nthe Fed raising short-term interest rates 350 basis points. And most people attribute at least part of this unusual structure of interest rates to large flows of capital from\noverseas into this country.\nWhat’s evident—and potentially disturbing—about this trend is that our federal deficits have been financed more and more by overseas lenders. While the availability\nof capital from overseas contributes to lower interest rates and stronger economic growth in this country, I’m concerned that this trend is unsustainable.\nIn many ways, our economy has entered uncharted waters when it comes to global imbalances, which is one reason I suspect many people feel uneasy about the\neconomic outlook, despite the mostly positive economic data I’ve already described for you.\nEven our best and brightest economists cannot be sure of how all the effects of globalization play out in our economy. A large body of our economic forecasting is\nbuilt on models—some with many variables and others that are less elaborate. By definition, economic modeling assumes one can learn from the past—predicting\nfuture outcomes according to prior relationships and previously observed behaviors. But the rapid pace of globalization has altered many of these variables, and our\neconomy continues to adjust in unexpected ways.\nA policymaker’s view\nSo what does this economic outlook and my analysis of globalization suggest for monetary policy? First, let me provide some background on recent Fed actions. In\nthe early stages of the solid economic expansion that’s now firmly established, the Fed began to remove the very accommodative monetary policy put in place from\n2001 to 2003. The economy continued to gain momentum, and in fourteen consecutive steps going back to June 2004, we raised the fed funds target rate from an\nextraordinarily low 1 percent to its current rate of 4½ percent rate. This current rate, by the way, is still relatively low by some historical standards.\nDuring the past 20 or so months that the Fed has been steadily increasing short-term interest rates from unsustainably low levels, the FOMC was able to clearly\ncommunicate to financial markets the path of policy and the likely timing of recalibration. Based on the economic conditions at that time, the Fed had the latitude to be\nexplicit in our communication with the public.\nWhile our various steps to enhance the transparency of policy actions have been helpful to both financial markets and to policymaking, it’s important to recognize that\nour policy path over the coming period is somewhat less certain. And, as I’ve said on other occasions, as policymakers we should resist the urge to say more than we\nknow.\nI continue to think the most likely path for the economy is sustained GDP growth with inflation and inflation expectations contained within acceptable bounds. But I,\nlike others, will be watching very carefully as events unfold.\nSeveral areas warrant close attention. As I suggested earlier, households and businesses seem to be coping with persistently higher energy prices without a major\nreallocation of spending. But it’s possible we haven’t yet seen the full adjustment to the new reality of elevated energy costs. Also, we don’t yet know the full effects of\nthe potential transitions in residential real estate markets. Despite the removal of very accommodative Fed monetary policy, credit markets are still accommodative, in\nmy view, and this liquidity could boost the economic expansion and contribute to stronger-than-expected inflationary pressures. The relative lack of broad pricing\npower that’s been observed in many competitive world markets could begin to change, especially if domestic demand increases beyond present forecasts.\nWhile we don’t yet know the full impact of the significant policy adjustments of the past twenty months, I believe these actions have made a favorable economic\noutcome much more likely. At present, my sense is the balance of risks to both growth and inflation forecasts is now close to being equal.\nClosing\n\n\fIn closing, I hope I’ve conveyed my view of today’s economic expansion as being well-grounded and likely to continue in the near future. And that outlook is good\nnews for the Southern economy, which is a microcosm of the national economy. In my remarks, I also tried to be candid in suggesting that in today’s increasingly\nglobal environment there are some new uncertainties that we must continue to try to fully understand and learn how to take into account. Finally, I hope I’ve conveyed\nthat a monetary policymaker’s job is to nurture sustainable economic growth in a steady, low-inflation environment over the long term. In my view, the Fed has made\nsignificant adjustments to policy with the aim of enabling favorable economic conditions that allow businesses to make rational decisions without interference from\nhigh and unstable inflation.\nNow, I’m no historian. But I was around for much of the 20th century, and I’ve had an up-close and personal view of economic change in the Southeast since I started\nworking for the Atlanta Fed more than 40 years ago. Early in my career, I remember the Southeast economy lagged behind much of the rest of the country. But that\nwas before the emergence of today’s postindustrial economy. Where do we go from here? There will be some ups and downs along the way. But it’s my hope and\nbelief that the rise of Southern capitalism is only beginning and that our best days are still ahead as we adjust to a new set of economic circumstances for the 21st\ncentury.\n\nCONTACTS\nJean Tate\n404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nPress Release\nSpeeches\n\n\f"

And let me say up front that I think 2006 should bring\nus another year of solid expansion, with perhaps a slightly different mix of economic factors. Over the next few minutes, I plan to give you my take on last year’s\neconomic performance along with a high-level outlook for this year. Then I want to talk about some long-term economic challenges before closing with some personal\nobservations on inflation and monetary policy.\nA look back at 2005\nLet’s begin with a look at the past year. As measured by gross domestic product (GDP), the most familiar gauge of broad economic growth, 2005 was a very good\nyear overall. During the third quarter (the latest available), GDP increased 4.1 percent—a very solid number that would have been even higher if not for last year’s\nterrible hurricanes.\nWhile fourth quarter growth may turn out to have been a bit slower, in all likelihood overall growth for 2005 was more than 3.5 percent. To put this economic\nperformance into perspective, GDP growth over the last 10 quarters was on average 3.8 percent—comparable to the booming late 1990s.\nClearly, one key to this positive economic story is the American consumer. During the first three quarters of 2005, personal consumption expenditures increased at an\naverage rate of about 3.7 percent. That solid growth may have moderated some recently, reflecting in part the impact of higher energy costs and adjustments to\nincentive programs for cars and trucks. But overall consumer spending has been well maintained.\nImportantly, higher energy costs do not seem to have dampened businesses’ desire to hire new workers. Indeed, labor markets are stronger now than a year ago.\nThe unemployment rate in 2005 declined from 5.4 to 4.9 percent, and the median duration of unemployment also declined. Additional hiring was broad-based, from\nconstruction to leisure and hospitality to business services. Late in the year, even manufacturing employment was positive.\nIn September, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed many jobs along the Gulf Coast, an area encompassing about half of 1 percent of the nation’s employment base\nat the time. Based on what we’ve seen and heard, the negative impact on employment was confined to the Gulf Coast area. During 2005, about 2 million new jobs\nwere added for an average of about 168,000 per month.\nThe outlook for 2006\nWhen I spoke to you last January, payroll expansion was still uncertain. But now, after two years of steady job creation, I’m expecting more of the same: nonfarm\npayroll growth averaging 150,000 to 200,000 per month in 2006, with the unemployment rate holding near its current level of 4.9 percent or perhaps moving a bit\nlower.\nLabor markets are always important to the economic outlook, but in 2006 another important factor is—once again—business spending. In a climate of strong\ncompetitive pressures, spending on equipment and software for much of last year grew at annual rates of more than 10 percent—a pace that I think is realistic to\nexpect in 2006.\nAt the same time, painful restructuring continues in some industries, and spending on new commercial construction hasn’t improved significantly. But, in general,\nbusinesses across the United States not only are adding to their productive capacity but also are continuing to make the capital investments required to improve\nefficiency. Moreover, most corporate balance sheets are flush with the cash needed to make these investments. Since 2003, corporate profits from current production\nhave climbed rapidly and during the first nine months of last year were up about 15 percent.\nAs we move into 2006, activity in housing markets remains very strong. But there are signs that demand may be gradually returning to more normal and sustainable\nlevels. In November, existing home sales declined, and the inventory of unsold existing homes increased to about five months. The pace of construction, especially\ncondominiums, appears to have eased. At the same time, mortgage rates are still low by historical standards. While earlier forecasts of a housing slowdown turned\nout to have been premature, I expect to see more moderate growth of housing construction, sales, and price appreciation in 2006 compared with 2005.\nHere in the Southeast, insurance and government money is beginning to flow into parts of the Gulf Coast region devastated by last year’s hurricanes. To put things in\nperspective, Katrina and Rita destroyed more than 350,000 dwellings, with another 145,000 suffering major structural damage, according to recent estimates. Much of\nthe spending so far has been for demolition and cleanup, which I saw firsthand during a visit to the area in October. The immense shortage of housing impedes\nrecovery, with so many residents and businesses still living in (and operating from) other places, including Atlanta. For the hardest-hit areas, including New Orleans,\nwhere I spent more than 12 years of my Fed career, it pains me to say that substantial rebuilding may take longer than first thought—according to some estimates,\nperhaps five years or more. Effective coordination of local, state, and federal policies and resources is especially important to the ongoing rebuilding efforts.\nFor the overall U.S. economy, as I mentioned a moment ago, I think the outlook remains quite favorable for 2006, and I expect we’ll enjoy a solid economic expansion\n\n\ffor a third straight year. But I also want to recognize a troubling disconnect between my mostly positive outlook and some less sanguine discourse on the economy. In\none recent survey, a majority of U.S. investors described the current economy as “in a slowdown” or “in recession.” And despite the positive vital signs in the\neconomy, a surprising number of our business contacts continue to express concern that trouble is lurking ahead.\nEnergy price volatility\nFor the next few moments I’d like to talk about three longer-range economic issues that seem to be gnawing at our public consciousness. And the first is energy.\nDuring the 1970s, you’ll recall, energy price shocks were accommodated by monetary policy that led to high inflation, followed by back-to-back recessions in the early\n1980s as policy was corrected. Then, after new supplies of energy were found, oil prices fell to about $10 to $12 a barrel. In this era of cheap oil, energy producers\nhad little incentive to increase supplies, and energy users had little incentive to conserve.\nUntil recently, our experience was that oil would revert to the range of about $20–$30 a barrel. But now, after two years of increasing energy prices, with strong\nworldwide demand and limits on new supply, oil futures markets and business decision makers seem to be concluding that the old equilibrium price no longer holds. In\nshort, we may have to get used to a new era of higher and more volatile energy prices.\nEnergy costs are not something we can control, but we can adjust our thinking and our behavior to conform to increased economic uncertainties. Consumers can alter\ntheir energy consumption habits, and businesses can decide to invest in more fuel-efficient equipment. Policymakers can do their part by developing forward-looking\nand well-grounded policies for sustainable energy development and consumption. As for monetary policy, an important Fed imperative is to try to keep energy price\nincreases from causing a general run-up of inflation, and I’ll have more to say in a few moments about our commitment to price stability.\nWorkforce issues\nIn addition to energy, a variety of workforce issues have confounded public opinion. As I said earlier, the U.S. economy is now creating a solid number of new jobs,\nand I repeatedly hear of shortages of skilled workers in industries such as construction, with wages for some jobs going up significantly.\nBut many workers have seen their job security evaporate in recent years. For instance, the U.S. apparel industry declined dramatically over the last decade because\nof competition from lower-paid workers in other countries. But job insecurity is not just a matter of global competition for low-skilled manufacturing jobs. U.S. airlines\nand automobile makers, for instance, confront cost pressures that have caused some employers to make deep cuts in payrolls—a development that hits home in the\nAtlanta area.\nWith businesses focused on cost cutting, there has been strong downward pressure on wage growth. Since the 2001 recession, growth in the average wage, as\nmeasured by the Employment Cost Index, has slowed. Moreover, employee and retiree benefit programs that have long been taken for granted are now being\nquestioned. Adding to the uncertainty about the future, the federal government could begin to feel pressure to address shortfalls in private-sector retiree health care\nand pension obligations just as Congress is confronting its own funding challenges. And that brings me to the third source of perceived economic insecurity I want to\ndiscuss: the looming federal deficit.\nFiscal deficits\nLast year, after the election, I expressed hope that that our fiscal policymakers would make progress in reducing the federal budget deficit. The 2005 deficit was $317\nbillion, much lower than the record high level of $412 billion in the prior year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. So we’ve seen improvement, but our fiscal\ndeficits have persisted during this time of solid economic growth, and the extended outlook is very worrisome.\nOur nation’s looming deficits are unlike anything we’ve seen before, with plausible baseline shortfalls measured not in billions but in trillions in the aggregate over the\nnext decade. We’ve been reminded over and over that costs for Medicare and Social Security are projected to increase dramatically over the next decade and\nthreaten federal government balance sheets, with the big hits beginning about 2012 and thereafter.\nBut there’s more. This year, a new and expanded Medicare prescription drug program takes effect at the same time that we face open-ended costs for ongoing wars,\nhurricane relief, and other spending programs.\nMy point is we need to make sure that deficits don’t get out of hand, especially with about 76 million baby boomers approaching retirement age. It’s hard to prove\nempirically that fiscal deficits cause inflation. Most research on the subject has looked at temporary deficits, not deficits due to permanent increases in entitlements\nlike we are facing now. But history—and common sense—tells us that most inflation problems arise in economies with large fiscal deficits. In other countries, fiscal\ndeficits have been associated with unwelcome rises in inflation. This year, I’m hopeful that the gravity of our long-term fiscal imbalance will soon lead to some tough\ndecisions that will bring forth viable long-term solutions.\nInflation and monetary policy\nAlong with fiscal policy, monetary policy is another key component of our economic foundation. As you know, the Fed’s goal is to foster long-term economic growth\nand stable prices. While fiscal policy tends to take effect quickly—like a shot of adrenaline—monetary policy works with a lag. Both monetary and fiscal policy must be\napplied carefully and ideally should work together, as we saw in the 1990s, when fiscal deficits turned into surpluses and the economy enjoyed an extended period of\nsolid growth and low and stable inflation. Fiscal and monetary policy also worked in tandem to help cushion the pain of the 2001 recession.\nLet’s review our recent monetary policy path. When I spoke to you last January, the economic expansion was well under way. Our Federal Open Market Committee\nhad raised the fed funds target from an extremely low 1 percent to 2¼ percent—and on several occasions last year I expressed uneasiness about the unintended\nconsequences of leaving rates too low for too long. Now, after eight more rate hikes in 2005, the fed funds target rate is 4¼ percent.\nSo for me, the overriding policy consideration in 2005 was to lean against potential inflationary pressures. During the year, our business contacts suggested that\nelevated energy prices and other cost pressures were providing both the incentive and the determination to pass through those higher costs. As it turned out, the\nconsumer price index did drift upward during the year. The core inflation measures, which exclude food and energy, were more stable. Core CPI on a year-over-year\nbasis moved from about 1½ percent in early 2004 to 2¼ percent in 2005.\nThe good news is that core inflation measures have not moved noticeably higher in recent months. In my view, adjustments in monetary policy have helped to limit\nthese inflationary pressures. Also, competitive market forces and strong productivity increases are contributing to our currently low inflationary environment. In our\nextremely competitive global economy, businesses must continually find new and better ways of providing goods and services at lower cost, and in many cases these\n\n\fefforts are reflected in lower prices to consumers.\nEven more important than maintaining acceptable levels of current inflation is containing future inflation expectations, which influence the behavior of business\ndecision makers and financial markets. Deterioration in inflation expectations can be reflected quickly in current prices. Once unleashed, expectations of higher\ninflation can distort business decision making and erode market confidence. Once embedded in the marketplace, measurably higher inflation and inflation\nexpectations are extremely hard and costly to reverse, as we experienced during the recession of 1981. It’s vital that the Fed’s words and actions clearly\ncommunicate our commitment to lean against the emergence of expectations of rising inflation.\nIn the minutes from our Dec. 13 meeting, we acknowledged the potential risks of rising inflation expectations in an environment of elevated energy costs and following\na period of monetary policy that had been accommodative for some time. Also, we made it clear that considerable monetary accommodation had been removed and\nthat we were approaching a more uncertain time in our process of recalibration.\nGiven the steady diet of “measured” rate hikes the Fed has provided in the past year and a half, many of you may be wondering when enough is enough. Let me first\nrespond by saying the closer we get, the less explicit we can be on that point. One reason is that we don’t yet know the full economic effect of the policy moves we\nhave already made. So in the months ahead, we’ll have to watch the data very carefully to make sure that growth is still on track and inflation expectations are well\nanchored.\nFor some additional insight into the FOMC’s thinking, let me point to a phrase from our December meeting minutes, which were released last week. In those minutes,\nwe said that in looking ahead “the number of additional firming steps required probably would not be large.” While our policy direction has been quite clear over the\npast 18 months, in the less certain period ahead it’s my personal opinion that as policymakers we should resist the temptation to say more than we know at any given\ntime. And so I think it’s appropriate that our post-meeting statements have come with the caveat that “the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects\nas needed.”\nIn a perfect world, the economy would continue to grow at a pace about equal to its longer-term potential, with inflation in a range that is relatively low and stable, and\nwith inflation expectations well-anchored. And in the quarters ahead, we could experience such an ideal economic outcome. But of course we don’t live in a perfect\nworld.\nTen years ago, when I first spoke to this group, we were in what turned out to be the longest peacetime economic expansion in our nation’s history. Since then, we’ve\nhad some major economic setbacks. But after each blow—no matter how nasty or surprising—our economy recovered and recovered quickly. I believe one of the\nimportant lessons that has been reinforced is that monetary policy that is focused on low and stable inflation helps our economy stay resilient and strong.\nAnd so we begin 2006 with an economy that in my view looks set to continue on a good path of sustainable GDP growth in the range of 3 to 4 percent. The economic\nfundamentals appear sound—consumer spending, business spending, and hiring should continue to grow at a solid pace. And inflation expectations should remain\nanchored.\nToday, this economic strength gives us a crucial opportunity to respond effectively to the challenges of tomorrow: to develop sustainable energy policies, to build a\nworkforce for the increasingly competitive economy of the 21st century, and to deal with our fiscal deficits. Crises do not often lead to good long-term economic\npolicies. So let’s do the right thing for future generations and act now when our economy is strong.\n\nCONTACTS\nJean Tate\n404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nPress Release\n\n\f"
