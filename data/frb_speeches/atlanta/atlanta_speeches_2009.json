        "content": "SPEECHES\n\nEconomic Recovery, Small Business, and the Challenge of Commercial Real Estate\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nUrban Land Institute\nEmerging Trends in Real Estate Conference\nAtlanta, Ga.\nNov. 10, 2009\nI appreciate the opportunity to speak to and with this sophisticated real estate audience about the interaction between conditions in the commercial\nreal estate (CRE) sector and the prospects for economic recovery. In earlier speeches, I have drawn attention to the exposure of the country's\nbanking and financial system to troubled commercial real estate loans as a significant emerging risk.\nBut in those speeches I didn't go much beyond identification of the risk, suggesting it bears watching.\nThis morning I'd like to go a bit further and venture an assessment of the CRE problem's likely impact on economic recovery. I will try to give you a\nsense—as a policymaker concerned with the broad economy—of how I am sizing up the commercial real estate challenge. One of my themes this\nmorning will be the links, or connectivity, between sectors and the potential for troublesome, self-reinforcing interactions.\nI must emphasize that the views I'll express are my personal thoughts and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve and\non the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic situation\nI believe an economic recovery is under way. It probably started in the summer.\nThe third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth number was 3.5 percent, the first increase in real GDP since mid-2008 and the largest gain since 2007. The primary\ncontributor to this gain was real consumer spending, which rose at a 3.4 percent rate, largely because of the \"cash for clunkers\" program. In addition, federal outlays grew\nrapidly, and the pace of inventory liquidation slowed. Accompanying positive GDP news, inflation measures remained relatively subdued.\nThere are other signs of improving conditions. Home prices appear to have bottomed out and have begun to move up in some markets. House sales appear to be growing in\nmany markets.\nSome financial markets—but not all—have stabilized, and risk spreads have normalized. For example, in the very important short-term interbank lending market, one-month\nand three-month LIBOR rates are very close to precrisis levels as measured by the spread over the federal funds rate.\nThe situation is much improved, but there are sobering aspects of the economic picture. Let me cite two.\nFirst, the economy has been supported and stimulated by several government programs. Appropriately, these programs are temporary. However, they are at various stages\nof removal or extension. It might be useful to go over the status of the key programs.\nThe $787 billion fiscal stimulus program remains in force. Nearly $200 billion of this amount has been paid out through the end of October.\nThe \"cash for clunkers\" program, part of the stimulus effort, has already expired.\nThe first-time home buyers' tax credit has been broadened and extended for another nine months.\nUnemployment insurance has been extended.\nThe Fed's credit market support liquidity facilities are winding down on their own.\nThe Fed's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) to support asset-backed securities markets is expected to expire in March 2010 with the exception of newly\nissued commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which is scheduled to expire in June.\nThe Fed's large-scale asset purchase program of Treasury securities ended Oct. 30. The agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency note purchases are\nscheduled to conclude at the end of the first quarter next year.\nThe Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), used to inject capital into banks, is seeing some return of capital to the government.\nThe FDIC's temporary liquidity guarantee program has expired.\nThese are by no means all of the government efforts to stabilize the economy and financial markets, stimulate activity, and treat the effects of job loss. Certainly, the Fed's\nmaintenance of its policy rate at the so-called zero lower bound for almost a year now should not be overlooked.\nA second reason to strike a note of caution about the economic picture is that both the data and anecdotal descriptions of ground-level reality are quite mixed. Data on\nforeclosures, unemployment, personal income, and bank failures continue to disappoint. Also, nonresidential construction continues to decline, and state and local\ngovernment budgets remain severely constrained.\nAlong with my colleagues at the Atlanta Fed, I spend a lot of my time asking business contacts about industry conditions and the outlook for their businesses. In recent\nsoundings we've heard frequently about weak top-line sales, continuing inventory liquidation, reticence regarding capital expenditures, and reluctance to hire.\nCharacteristics of this recession\nTurning to the outlook from here, my baseline forecast is for a relatively subdued pace of growth beyond the current quarter and through the medium term. The potential\n\n\fsluggishness of the recovery partly reflects certain unique characteristics of this recession. It was led by a crisis in banking and capital markets that was triggered by a sharp\nand persistent reduction in valuations of residential real estate assets.\nThe downturn in residential real estate did not remain contained in that sector. Trouble was transmitted to the rest of the economy via credit markets. The housing downturn\ntriggered a crisis on Wall Street that soon became a recession on Main Street, and, as job losses mounted and delinquencies rose, fed back again to financial markets. Also,\npersonal consumption retrenched because of the real estate price shock, tighter credit, and fear of job loss hitting close to home.\nDespite marked improvements in financial markets from a year ago and improved flow of private capital to banks in recent months, the banking system has not fully\nrecovered—far from it. Bank credit losses are still climbing, and many banks are still capital constrained. It almost goes without saying that recovery of the banking system is\ncrucial to the recovery of the overall economy.\nTo draw insights from the recession relevant to the future, it's instructive to consider the connectivity among sectors and the potential of a self-reinforcing negative feedback\nloop involving multiple sectors.\nToday, I'm particularly concerned about the interaction among bank lending, small business employment, and CRE values.\nTo elaborate, there is a tight linkage between CRE values and jobs. In a mid-September conference at the Atlanta Fed, CRE practitioners, investors, and academics agreed\nthat the evolution of the CRE picture will depend greatly on the path of employment. This point was strongly reinforced in the Urban Land Institute's \"Emerging Trends in Real\nEstate\" report at this conference.\nSmall business impact\nLet me go on to show the link between jobs and small business credit. During the last two economic expansions, small firms (those with fewer than 50 employees)\ncontributed about one-third of net job growth. But the depth and duration of this recession have taken a substantial toll on small businesses. In the 2001 recession, small\nfirms held up reasonably well and accounted for only 9 percent of net job loss. In this recession, however, small firms have accounted for about 45 percent of net job losses\nper our most recent data through the end of 2008.\nSmall businesses tend to depend greatly on the banking sector—especially community and regional banks—for financing. A Federal Reserve survey earlier in the decade\nshowed that more than half of smaller firms had a credit line or loan with a bank. In addition, about half of these businesses used a personal or business credit card to\nfinance working capital. In this recession, credit standards have tightened for all businesses, including small businesses.\nAt this juncture, it's hard to be encouraged about a fast rebound in job growth. As you know, last week's employment report pushed the official unemployment rate to 10.2\npercent, the highest since May 1983. Â,â Net job losses continue on a monthly basis but at a declining pace. Because employment growth tends to lag recovery from a\nrecession and because of factors such as small business credit constraints, my current outlook for employment is one of very slow net job gains once the trend reverses, in\nall likelihood sometime next year. If this view is correct, this job growth outlook doesn't help the commercial real estate situation.\nSo how serious is the CRE problem for the financial system and the broad economy?\nFirst, let me provide some overview comments: While the CRE problem is serious for parts of the banking industry, I don't believe it poses a broad risk to the financial\nsystem. Compared with residential real estate, the size of the CRE debt market is smaller, and the exposure is more concentrated in smaller banks.\nHowever, I am concerned about the potential impact of CRE on the broader economy. Unlike residential real estate, there is not the same direct linkage from CRE to\nhousehold wealth—and therefore consumption—caused by erosion of home equity. However, there could be an impact resulting from small banks' impaired ability to support\nthe small business sector—a sector I expect will be critically important to job creation.\nTo add some detail: At the end of June 2009 there was approximately $3.5 trillion of outstanding debt associated with CRE. This figure compares with about $11 trillion of\nresidential debt outstanding.\nAbout 40 percent of the CRE debt is held on commercial bank balance sheets in the form of whole loans. A lot of the CRE exposure is concentrated at smaller institutions\n(banks with total assets under $10 billion). These smaller banks account for only 20 percent of total commercial banking assets in the United States but carry almost half of\ntotal CRE loans (based on Bank Call Report data).\nMany small businesses rely on these smaller banks for credit. Small banks account for almost half of all small business loans (loans under $1 million). Moreover, small firms'\nreliance on banks with heavy CRE exposure is substantial. Banks with the highest CRE exposure (CRE loan books that are more than three times their tier 1 capital) account\nfor almost 40 percent of all small business loans.\nTo repeat my current assessment, while the CRE problem is very worrisome for parts of the banking industry, I don't see it posing a broad risk to the financial system.\nNonetheless, CRE could be a factor that suppresses the pace of recovery. As the recovery develops, the CRE problem will be a headwind, but not a show stopper, in my\nview.\nIt's appropriate to be a bit tentative in the assessment of CRE risk to the financial system, however. In 2007, many underestimated the scale and contagion potential of the\nsubprime residential mortgage-backed securities problem. With this experience in mind, my assessment should continue to be refined.\nThat said, I do see the process of CRE adjustment and resolution as a pivotal element of economic rebuilding. Toward these ends, on Oct. 30, financial regulators issued\nguidance addressed to both bank examiners and financial institutions. The guidance called for a balanced and pragmatic approach to CRE loan workouts and examiner loan\nclassifications, consistent with accurate and timely recognition of losses.\nIn my view, now that growth has resumed, the overall objective of economic policy should be to bring about a durable recovery and an environment that reduces\nunemployment as quickly as possible while containing inflationary pressures. The process of achieving this objective will necessarily involve judicious removal of government\nsupports and the normalization of monetary policy. As policymakers consider these decisions, attention to the state and trends in the commercial real estate sector will be\nessential.\n\n\fContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed Speeches\n\n\f"

        "content": "SPEECHES\n\nEarly Childhood Education, Economic Development, and the Business Community\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nUniversity of Miami\nCoral Gables, Fla.\nOctober 22, 2009\nI'm delighted to be here at the University of Miami as part of your program, \"Investing in Florida's Future.\" For the purposes of addressing you today,\nlet me explain that I'm wearing two hats. One hat is the Federal Reserve hat. The other is cochair of a commission on early childhood education for\na 13-county area that encompasses metropolitan Atlanta. It turns out that a linkage can be made between my responsibility as an economic\npolicymaker and my role leading the commission. I'll touch on that in a moment. The commission is a creature of the United Way of Metropolitan\nAtlanta. The purpose of the commission is to assess the pre-K education landscape in the Atlanta area and recommend a way forward.\nThe commission began its proceedings about a year ago and is now getting to the point of finalizing findings and recommendations. The\ncommission will make recommendations to a number of stakeholders in the Atlanta community who have equity in the cause of early childhood\neducation. Among those stakeholders, we have presumed, is the business community.\nIn my remarks today I will discuss the connection between the interests and capabilities of a metro area business community and investment in preK early childhood education as a foundational element of economic development.\nDefining pre-K early childhood education\nLet me make clear what I'm talking about. Before I began the work of our commission I knew little about the specifics of pre-K education. So it would not surprise me if some\nof you aren't sure what this subject is all about.\nI'm talking about broadly accessible center-based, professionally delivered, appropriately curriculum-centered education for young children starting as early as two and a half\nyears old. That starting point is, today, mostly an aspiration. A more feasible focus would be on three- and four-year-olds. I am also talking about engagement of parents\nthrough the whole period from before birth to five years old, the age at which most children enter the formal kindergarten-to-grade 12 school system. Over this time span,\nadvocates place special emphasis on the period from birth through two years old, when parents are the dominant influence on child development.\nLet me also be clear what I am not talking about. Early childhood education, in my thinking, should not be confused with simple, low-quality day care. Of course, some\nelement of day care comes with any structured effort for children of this age. But the most developed early education programs aim to develop the child's cognitive, social,\nemotional, and motor skill readiness for the start of formal schooling in kindergarten.\nDiscipline applied to the work of the Atlanta commission\nWhat I have just described evokes a variety of legitimate questions and reactions in some quarters. These range from skepticism that social investment in this sort of initiative\nwill make much difference over time to indignation at the suggestion that many young children cannot achieve kindergarten readiness in the home.\nIn conducting the work of the Atlanta commission, we have been mindful of the full spectrum of natural doubts and reactions and have tried to adhere to some guiding\nprinciples—or disciplines.\nWe agreed to ground the case for further action and investment in empirical evidence.\nWe committed to making very concrete recommendations addressed to specific stakeholders.\nWe agreed to shape recommendations that will meet the test of practical feasibility, particularly where scarce funding resources are concerned. And in that regard, we have\ntried to apply the standard of measurable return on investment.\nCoverage of the commission\nWe began our commission's work with what we called our education phase. Over eight meetings, we were exposed to the neurology of young child development, the\nresearch on the economic development impact of early learning intervention, the current norms of quality in early education, and the practical experience of other cities and\nstates in this field.\nAmong the more powerful presentations was that of Miami's David Lawrence. I'm sure most of you are aware of Dave's work here in Dade County and Florida. Dave\nemphasized that community leaders who are trying to advance the cause of early education must think of their efforts as a political and social movement. We're incorporating\nthat notion into our commission's recommendations for Atlanta.\nAs I said earlier, the Atlanta commission is in the process of finalizing findings and recommendations, so I would be jumping the gun to declare where we'll come out. So for\nmy remaining remarks I'd like to stick to the personal views I've arrived at over the last year.\nI've concluded that there are common tradeoffs and decision variables that each community must confront. Therefore, the unique circumstances of communities will result in\ndiffering approaches. Each community must find its own model.\nEach community must wrestle with and ultimately take a position on these considerations:\nThe target age and population of children to be addressed by funded programs. Is the focus four-year-olds, or three- and four-year-olds, all children, or underprivileged\nchildren?\n\n\fThe degree of programmatic engagement of parents, particularly in the prenatal stage and the early years.\nThe working definition of quality as well as the ways quality distinctions are communicated to parents. Indications of quality include curriculum content, teacher qualifications,\nchild-teacher ratios, and physical set-up of classrooms.\nThe locus of movement leadership, recognizing that in most communities providers will be a diverse mix of private and public entities and individuals.\nAnd, importantly, the money question. That is, the method and distribution of funding families' access to programs of measured quality.\nIn my view, the reality of the early education landscape in most locales is a public-private partnership, and this arrangement will be the case for some time. The private side\nof this partnership will include for-profit, not-for-profit, faith-based, and secular providers. Bringing common and rising quality standards to this diverse community of providers\nand injecting market mechanisms to ensure there are incentives to improve quality are central challenges.\nSummary case for investment in early education\nI would like to connect the cause of early education to the business community—here in Miami, in Atlanta, or anywhere—but before doing that let me summarize the\ninvestment case.\nAt a high level, there is a compelling macroeconomic case for early childhood education as part of the education continuum. The contribution of education overall to labor\nproductivity growth is estimated in various studies to be between 13 and 30 percent of total growth.\nResearch validates the claim that intervention early in life improves kindergarten readiness, performance in school, and later success in life as indicated by sustained\nemployment, income, and health. Research further supports the claim that investment in early education for underprivileged, otherwise at-risk children yields the highest\nreturn. Some of this return accrues to the individuals as they advance through school and through adulthood. Some return accrues to society in the form of reduced public\nfiscal expenditure for remedial needs. The alternative to quality early education is to spend more down the road on criminal justice and social programs to treat a whole range\nof problems including school dropouts, teen pregnancy, crime, public health, and adult illiteracy.\nIn a recent speech, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke cited the body of research in support of early education. He said this research \"documented the high returns\nthat early childhood programs can pay in terms of subsequent educational attainment and in lower rates of social problems, such as teenage pregnancy and welfare\ndependency.\"\nI know it sounds flippant, but I believe we should view it as a pay now or pay later situation, with the costs of fixing problems associated with failed lives far greater than\ngetting those lives started right at the beginning.\nBusiness interests and business leadership\nBusiness communities across the country have recognized their interest in education in general and in the K-12 public school system in particular. In many major\nmetropolitan areas, there is intense attention being given to fixing the public schools. I'd like to suggest that a second strategy is worth considering. Along with improving the\nK-12 public schools, improve the young students entering the schools. Kindergarten readiness is a legitimate concern. Being behind on day one, with odds against catching\nup, is a portentous handicap for a child.\nI see a definite connection between efforts to improve early education and the long-term economic health of a city, county, or state. Business people understand that their\nenterprises will not prosper in an environment of rampant social problems, shaky public sector finances leading in all probability to rising taxes, and uncompetitive human\ncapital.\nIt is the human capital aspect—the imperative to invest in and upgrade our human capital—that I consider the most profound link to the interests of the business community. I\ndon't need to tell you here in Miami that we now compete in a global economy in which higher-order work—the best jobs—goes to the best educated and trained. We cannot\nwall ourselves off from this reality. Competitive human capital means productive employees, competent and responsive suppliers, and customers with money to spend.\nI'm sure it is the case here in Miami, and I know it is the case in Atlanta, that the business community plays a decisive leadership role in moving vital community initiatives\nforward.\nI've already described the likely persistent reality of a diffused landscape of early education providers, funders, advocacy groups, and interested actors. I believe you in the\nbusiness community can contribute a great deal, especially your skills and understanding in the domains of financial disciplines like return on investment, business-model\nthinking, governance, and competitive market mechanisms.\nI also believe business community leadership and advocacy—because of business's stewardship of the economic welfare of the community—is needed to sustain what\nDavid Lawrence wisely describes as a long-term movement. Investment in children in their earliest years for payback to the individual and community years later requires\nconviction grounded in confidence that the community can organize and execute a strategy in pursuit of a vision that will take time to mature.\nI'll close with this thought: The national economy is now emerging from a very painful episode. As a central banker and economic policymaker, I see the recent financial crisis\nand recession as a wake-up call to think deeply about and then move ahead to build a foundation for sustained economic vitality. I consider early childhood education an\nimportant element of that foundation.\nREFERENCES\nBernanke, Ben. 2007. Education and economic competitiveness.

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nUniversity of South Alabama\nMitchell College of Business Center for Real Estate Studies\nCoastal Economy Outlook\nMobile, Alabama\nSeptember 30, 2009\nFor a long time, we've all endured a barrage of bad news about the national economy. Now—finally, 20 months after the start of the recession—the\nU.S. economy is clearly showing signs of recovery. So today I want to try to answer some questions on many minds: Is the recovery for real? Will it\nlast? How soon will happy days be here again?\nThis will be a speech about how to think about recovery, about how to mix appropriate optimism with a considered approach to weighing positive\nattributes against weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and risks.\nI will begin my remarks by taking stock of the economic situation in the United States along with a few comments on the international economy as it\naffects our country. I will give you my views on the nation's near-term and medium-term outlook and the degree and nature of uncertainty\nsurrounding that outlook.\nThese are my personal views and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nTaking stock\nUnquestionably, the economy is improving. But the vital signs—as captured in macroeconomic data—are mixed. There are pluses and minuses, positives and negatives. It's\nnot a uniform picture. Optimism is warranted but should be tempered by awareness that this is an economy substantially buttressed by a large number of temporary\ngovernment support programs.\nI agree with all who are declaring that a technical recovery is underway. We are technically in recovery when a contracting economy gives way to growth. But even vigorous\ngrowth off a low bottom does not necessarily bring back prior activity levels for some time. By most estimates, it will be the second half of 2010 before the 2007 levels of\nnational output are reached.\nLet me catalog what I believe are both positive notes and areas of weakness.\nA turnaround in the housing market is key to recovery. The housing market has begun to improve as measured by sales volumes, prices, and new home starts. Yet new and\nexisting house inventories remain high, suggesting a weak residential construction outlook. And house sales are being supported by two government programs.\nOne is the first-time homebuyer subsidy—in the form of a tax credit. This program is due to expire at the end of November. The other is the Fed's program of mortgagebacked securities purchases amounting to $1.25 trillion. This program has improved liquidity in a key credit market and helped to maintain mortgage rates at historically\ncompetitive levels, currently below 5 percent for the 30-year qualifying conventional loan.\nThe Fed's execution of purchases of mortgage-backed securities and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency notes is scheduled to run to the end of the first quarter of 2010,\nafter which private investors are expected to power the market.\nHousehold net worth took a big hit in the recession, and as a consequence personal consumption dropped strongly. Of course, there is more to the story of consumption\npullback. Starting in 2007, households began to deleverage, and in recent months the personal savings rate is up substantially.\nRising unemployment and fear of job loss, tighter consumer credit, and the savings/deleveraging phenomenon combined to push consumption down, especially in the\ndurables category. Consumer durables buying has recently improved, but this improvement is associated mostly with the cash-for-clunkers incentive in support of auto\npurchases.\nThe effect of this program drove an uptick in recent manufacturing numbers. Industrial production turned higher in July and August after eight straight months of decline.\nWhile output gains were most notable in the auto industry, modest production growth has been seen across a broader set of industries as well.\nStock market gains along with higher savings and stabilization of house prices have begun to restore some household net worth lost since this crisis began in 2007. It is\nestimated that American households saw $14 trillion dissipate, largely from stock market losses and house price deterioration through the first quarter of 2009. This loss\nrepresents more than 20 percent of their net worth. About $2 trillion was recouped in the second quarter of 2009, primarily from market appreciation. And stock market and\nhouse price appreciation have added to these gains in the third quarter.\nA moment ago, I mentioned the pall cast over the economy by rising unemployment. When I joined the Fed in March 2007, the national unemployment rate stood at 4.5\npercent. Today the rate is 9.7 percent and likely to rise from here before beginning to fall.\nThe consensus among forecasters is something approaching a jobless recovery. The administration's stimulus program has helped soften the pace of job loss. But a recent\ninquiry of Southeast state budget officials, conducted by the Atlanta Fed, suggested much of the benefit, in infrastructure construction at least, has been front-ended in 2009\nand early 2010.\n\n\fNonetheless, the pace of job loss is slowing. Nonfarm payrolls fell by 216,000 in August. Analysts expect that the September report due out Friday will show a decline of\n180,000. This level of job loss is an improvement in comparison to nearly 600,000 jobs lost in an average month in the first half of this year.\nBusiness spending for capital goods and inventory retrenched dramatically in the recession. Businesses remain very cautious about spending on equipment and software.\nThis category of spending fell at an annual rate of nearly 8.5 percent in the second quarter of 2009 after tumbling almost 37 percent in the first quarter.\nThe data still suggest businesses are trimming these investments, but the pace of decline slowed substantially in the first two months of the third quarter. And while\ninventories continue to be liquidated, the pace of liquidation is slowing. At some point, inventory replenishment is likely to begin at some level.\nA surprisingly positive factor in the current domestic economy and outlook is the global economy. A worldwide recovery is materializing, led by the developing economies of\nEast Asia and India. Data released last week indicate that global trade increased at its fastest pace in five years. Foreign demand is expected to add about 1.3 percentage\npoints to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter once the final numbers are calculated. But it should be said that this resurgence also reflects sizeable\ngovernment stimulus spending, the effect of which, like here in the United States, is transitory.\nFinancial markets\nImproving financial markets are providing support for recovery. Most large-scale credit markets are functioning much better, and I believe an array of policy actions taken by\nthe Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury, and other agencies, taken together, has reversed much of the financial market dysfunction that fueled the recession.\nAt this juncture, interbank funding has returned almost to the precrisis normal, and the corporate bond markets have improved markedly. The important asset-backed\nsecurities market—the market that ultimately finances pools of car loans, student loans, small business loans, and credit card receivables—has seen issuance volume\nsteadily return. But it should be pointed out that progress in the securitization markets has depended, to date, largely on a Federal Reserve support program.\nIn contrast, the flow of credit through the U.S. banking system is not yet approaching anyone's notion of normal. For the three months through June, U.S. commercial bank\nloans fell sharply for the second straight quarter despite a surge in mortgage refinances. Banks too have been deleveraging and repairing their balance sheets. A return to\nrobust bank lending is unlikely, at least in the near term.\nThe banking system is healing, but it will take time. Banks across the spectrum of size have received liquidity and capital support from several Federal Reserve, Treasury,\nand Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) programs. Many of these programs are winding down as banks turn to alternative sources of funds that are more cost\neffective.\nCommercial real estate\nI want to draw attention to a developing risk that could set back the progress being made by banks. That is commercial real estate. The recession weakened the\nfundamentals of all segments of commercial real estate (retail, office, hotel, warehouse, and—sometimes included—multifamily residential). Vacancies have risen, rents have\nfallen because of vacancies and renegotiations, and capitalization rates (the discount rate used to calculate value) have risen. This combination of factors has caused\nproperty values to fall, in some cases dramatically. Since banks and securities markets lend against the value of properties, loan-to-value ratios have deteriorated. As loans\ncome due, or as loan defaults occur, restitution of sound lending ratios has to happen. If not, loans must be written down.\nIn mid-September the Atlanta Fed held a one-day conference on commercial real estate involving investors, developers, bankers, and academics. Panelists made several\npoints worthy of mention.\nFirst, panelists said commercial real estate follows employment or, stated differently, recovery of commercial real estate is job-growth dependent. I've already commented\nthat the recovery—the early stages, at least—might not bring much employment growth.\nLots of commercial construction is still in process, and until growth of supply stops, the industry statistics will continue to deteriorate. Panelists also said loss recognition by\nlenders has to occur for capital to return to the commercial real estate sector. Some panelists in the conference spoke derisively of what they termed \"extend and pretend\"\nand \"delay and pray\" measures on the part of both banks and regulators.\nFinally, the worst is ahead of us, not behind us, according to participants.\nI'm sharing these qualitative assessments of the situation to give you a sense of opinions expressed by very credible participants in a conference held just two weeks ago.\nEconomic outlook\nAs I said at the start, the economy is definitely improving, but the signals we're getting in the macroeconomic data are mixed. I expect we'll see a growth number when the\nthird quarter is totaled up, so the economy is in recovery. But will it last? Let me give you my take on the outlook.\nIf you look at history, recoveries following a deep recession have more often than not been quite strong. The broad consensus among forecasters is this recovery will be\nweak in comparison. But even within that consensus there is diverse opinion about the speed and path by which the economy will reach its full potential for growth.\nBased on recent information, we at the Atlanta Fed have been raising our estimates of near-term growth, but we remain cautious about assuming much strength in the\nmedium term. There is too much uncertainty at the moment to project happy days almost here again.\nTo elaborate, I see as uncertain the time required for the housing market to return to health, the potential commercial real estate drag on the financial system, the\nsustainability of recovery in the absence of government supports, and the resurgence of private demand.\nI would be remiss if I failed to comment on the inflation outlook. As a central banker, I am always concerned with inflation prospects, and certainly constant vigilance is\nrequired. At present, inflationary pressures seem well contained. Recent inflation measures have been benign, inflation expectations of the public are stable as best we can\ntell, and my business contacts tell me they and their suppliers have very little pricing power in this environment.\nFurther, the concern expressed in some quarters over the growth last year of base elements of the money supply—namely, excess bank reserves and the Fed's balance\nsheet—strikes me as exaggerated. When the time comes, I am confident the Fed has the tools to reverse the assumed monetary stimulus and exit the policies put in place in\n\n\freaction to the financial crisis and the recession.\nMeasured optimism\nI do not think that time has yet come, and to be consistent with my outlook, I think it may well be some time before a comprehensive exit need be under way. I support the\nmaintenance of interest rates at low levels \"for an extended period,\" as the FOMC has communicated in its public statements. Assuming stable inflation, I would like to see\nmore evidence of private activity in the economy before advocating change in the Fed's overall monetary policy stance.\nWe all ardently want to believe the nation is on the economic comeback trail. I don't think we are served by declaring prematurely that we're in the clear, nor by overweighting\nthe lagging data and the risks. In thinking about the recovery, I recommend for now a mindset of measured optimism.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed Speeches\n\n\f"

        "content": "SPEECHES\n\nFederal Reserve Independence in a Global Context\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nWorld Affairs Council of Jacksonville\nJacksonville, Florida\nSeptember 10, 2009\nThere are around 90 active world affairs councils in the United States keeping their cities’ business and government leaders abreast of world\ndevelopments. Some serve a vital purpose of education and information directly pertinent to the economic welfare of the city and its hinterlands. I\nconsider the World Affairs Council of Jacksonville one of those. Jacksonville—with its important and growing port—makes a meaningful portion of\nits living from global exchange. The state of the world economy matters to Jacksonville.\nToday, I will discuss the U.S. economic situation along with developments in the global economy as they affect this country’s economic interests. I'll\nput forward a current assessment of the nation’s policy challenges using a framework familiar to country risk analysts. And I'll connect this analysis\nto the issue of central bank independence, an issue that is drawing serious attention as a result of the financial crisis and actions taken in response.\nIt's important that I emphasize that the views I'll express are my own and don’t necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\nStatus and forecast—U.S. economy\nTo lay the groundwork for this discussion, I'll begin with an overview of the current state of the U.S. economy. Overall, the U.S. economy is improving but still fragile.\nStabilization is proceeding, and the first stages of recovery are under way.\nIt is to be expected at a time like this that the vital signs of the economy are mixed. Some indicators are improving while others are not getting worse or are just declining at a\nslower pace. Let me detail some of the key signals we’re getting from the domestic economy.\nAlthough consumer confidence is rising, actual consumption has remained muted overall. Consumers remain cautious because of employment concerns and wealth loss.\nFinancing for consumer durable goods purchases is tight. Households continue to deleverage—that is, pay down debt. The savings rate is high compared with recent years.\nFor now, an atmosphere of frugality and self-restraint seems to have set in.\nManufacturing production numbers improved in July after eight months of decline, but this performance mostly reflects a surge in auto production, perhaps in anticipation of\nthe \"Cash for Clunkers\" program.\nInventories were liquidated aggressively during the first half of the year. The most recent survey of purchasing managers showed a slowing of liquidation. My view is that\nsome replenishment may be under way—notably auto inventories. But many businesses learned during the recession how to operate with leaner stocks.\nSales of both new and existing homes rose in August, and prices are up a little, according to the Case-Shiller index of 20 major real estate markets. However, regional\ninformation gathered by the Atlanta Fed across the Southeast is not uniformly upbeat.\nLast week's labor market report for August showed that the economy is still shedding jobs. The United States lost 216,000 jobs in August, and the unemployment rate rose to\n9.7 percent—the highest since June 1983.\nRegarding inflation, the headline inflation rate has fallen over the last year in part because of lower oil prices compared with a year ago. Core measures of inflation excluding\nfood and energy costs also have been drifting lower, currently measured at 1.5 percent. With continuing economic weakness and financial uncertainty, firms have very little\npricing power. I've tested this thesis in conversations with business leaders in this region with very little pushback. I expect inflation will remain contained for some time.\nAs I said, the picture is mixed, but stabilization and recovery appear to be taking hold.\nRecent improvements in the financial sector are supporting economic stabilization. Trust among financial institutions has been restored as reflected by risk spreads in the\ninterbank lending market. With the support of a Federal Reserve lending program, securitization of credit card receivables, auto paper, and student loans has bounced back\nto almost precrisis levels. Corporate bond issuance has been strong since the beginning of the year. Overall, capital flows reflect an unwinding of the near-total retreat from\nrisk-taking and the flight to safety that occurred last fall. Despite this improved flow of capital to riskier assets, financial conditions are still vulnerable, and the flow of credit\nremains constrained.\nOften a deep recession is followed by a sharp rebound in business and overall economic activity. As I look ahead, at least beyond the third quarter, I do not foresee this\ntrajectory. Over the medium term, I see a slow recovery with ongoing repair of the financial sector and structural adjustments in the broad economy.\nThere are risks to even this lackluster outlook. One risk I'm watching is the interplay of commercial real estate and the financial sector. Commercial real estate values across\nthe spectrum of property types—retail, office, hotel, warehouse—have fallen as a result of the recession. These values back loans held by banks and also by nonbank\nfinancial institutions and holders of commercial mortgage-backed securities. Maturing loans will bring the deterioration of lending ratios to a head.\nStatus and forecast—international economy\nLet me now turn to the international economy. Last fall, the financial crisis in the United States quickly spread to the rest of the world through trade and financial linkages. As\na result, the world economy fell into the worst recession since World War II.\n\n\fThe global economy is now emerging from a recession with the help of unprecedented monetary and fiscal support. Europe is expecting slightly improved performance in the\nshort term, although the strength of the European economy is uncertain beyond an immediate rebound. China and other developing countries in Asia are leading the global\nrecovery. Rising domestic demand and imports in China are contributing to economic recovery in export-oriented economies in Asia and elsewhere in the world.\nIf it was ever the case that the fortunes of the U.S. economy were decoupled from the rest of the world, it is no longer so. In 1968 total trade (the sum of exports and imports)\nwas about 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). By 1988 trade amounted to about 15 percent. As of last year, exports and imports together had risen to over 28\npercent of GDP.\nThe impact of increasing openness extends beyond markets for goods and services. The globalization of financial markets has been as important as—if not more important\nthan—the globalization of product markets. According to McKinsey & Co., total global capital flows rose from $1 trillion in 1990 to $11 trillion in 2007.\nBecause the United States runs a chronic trade deficit, foreign sources represent a considerable portion of the financing for the U.S. economy. Nonresident investors own\nnearly half of U.S. Treasury securities outstanding, 11 percent of U.S. equities, over 20 percent of U.S. corporate bonds, and about 15 percent of mortgage agency bonds.\nAlthough U.S. exports declined considerably in this recession and only now have begun to recover, the drop in imports was even larger. As a result, the U.S. current account\nand trade deficits narrowed somewhat. If this trend holds, the United States would become less reliant on the rest of the world for financing our public sector deficit as well as\noverall consumption.\nCountry risk exposure evaluation of the United States\nI began my career as an international banker in the Middle East. As a young banker I was taught the techniques of country risk and country exposure evaluation. I remember\nwell the speeches and lectures of some of the seasoned graybeards of my bank.\nThey taught that analysis begins with measurement of the relative growth of a country’s public sector versus its private sector. If the public sector is growing, one should\ndetermine how that growth is being financed. Is the government raising taxes or improving tax collection? Or is the government borrowing? If debt financing, is the\ngovernment borrowing from domestic sources in local currency or from external sources in foreign currency? If borrowing externally, what are the ratings trends of the\ncountry’s sovereign debt, and what seems to be the direction of creditor attitude and appetite?\nVery importantly, if the country is financing government spending domestically, is the balance sheet of the central bank growing, and does it appear that the central bank is\nmonetizing the growing public sector debt, perhaps under political pressure? Monetizing means issuing new money to buy the government’s debt. And how independently\ndoes the central bank appear to be operating?\nIf—from this analysis—we saw a picture of a public sector growing relative to the private sector, with that growth resulting from deficit spending, and that deficit spending\nbeing largely financed by the central bank monetizing new government debt, the conclusion was…do not increase the bank's exposure and do not go long on the country's\ncurrency.\nI was first exposed to this framework for analysis more than 30 years ago. I think it is still a sound framework. So, for our edification, let's apply this framework to the United\nStates. Let’s ask, what is our reality today within this framework?\nDuring the recession—over the last six quarters—total federal government outlays as a share of GDP grew from just under 5 percent to about 6.4 percent of GDP.\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the 2009 federal deficit will be about $1.6 trillion, or 11.2 percent of GDP. One international benchmark is 3 percent.\nThis is the ratio required to qualify as a new member of the European Monetary Union.\nTo finance federal deficits, the Treasury is issuing new debt. In 2009, the U.S. Treasury will issue about $1.7 trillion of net U.S. new debt. According to the Economist\nIntelligence Unit (EIU), this country’s national debt-to-GDP ratio will be 51 percent this year, up from 38 percent last year and is projected to reach 79 percent by 2013.\nBy comparison, the European Union's debt-to-GDP ratio was higher than the United States’ before the crisis and is expected to rise to nearly 90 percent by 2013. Among\nmajor developed economies, Japan is by far the most indebted. Its debt-to-GDP ratio reached 100 percent in 1997 and is forecast to hit 200 percent by 2011. By contrast,\ndeveloping countries are much less indebted. For the group as a whole, debt-to-GDP ratio is not expected to rise above 35 percent.\nDespite the recent growth in U.S. public indebtedness, the level of debt is still manageable. But the trend is unsustainable and in a less stable country would spell trouble. I\nam confident that we will return to a sustainable fiscal path, a judgment apparently shared by financial market participants that continue to absorb U.S. debt at quite low rates\nof return.\nHowever, it would be unwise to be Panglossian about the current stance of policy, and this includes monetary policy. As I noted earlier, one of the key questions of country\nrisk analysis is whether it appears that the central bank is monetizing the growing public sector debt, perhaps under political pressure.\nHere we are fortunate that both developed and developing countries have absorbed the hard lessons of history. For the most part, they have adopted institutional\narrangements that enhance the credibility of central banks in their efforts to maintain low and stable rates of inflation, even in the face of significant fiscal pressures. In the\nUnited States, such credibility has allowed the Federal Reserve, Congress, and Treasury the flexibility to aggressively respond to the financial crisis without a potentially\ndestructive unleashing of inflation expectations. And, thanks to operational independence, the Fed is not in a situation of monetizing the federal debt.\nStable inflation expectations and credibility are not guaranteed. The circumstances that promote stable expectations—particularly in an environment with rapidly rising fiscal\ndeficits and large injections of liquidity—arise by design, not by accident. Though the details of central bank design differ somewhat from country to country, experience\nclearly points to independence, accountability, and transparency as the key building blocks.\nIndependence, transparency, and the decentralized Federal Reserve System\nTo build on this theme, I believe central bank independence in the conduct of monetary policy can appropriately be considered an enduring principle of sound governance of\nany country or political entity that issues a currency. I came to believe this many years ago, long before I joined the Federal Reserve.\n\n\fCentral bank independence correlates well with low and stable inflation, which correlates with sustainable economic growth that maximizes employment. Those two very\ndesirable outcomes, not surprisingly, also happen to be the congressional mandates for the Federal Reserve.\nOver the past 15 years or so, institutional reforms designed to give central banks more independence to pursue price stability have been introduced around the world with\ngreat success.\nIn 1990, the EIU estimated that average inflation in the world was 40 percent. By 2000, it was 4.3 percent. This year, world inflation is expected to be a mere 2 percent—very\nclose to what many consider price stability.\nIt's no surprise I’m an advocate of central bank independence in the formulation of monetary policy. But the independence of a central bank cannot be sustained without a\nclear and deliberate regime of accountability to the public and their representatives. That regime requires what I call defined transparency. By this I mean formal reporting and\ncommunication practices that are sufficiently comprehensive and appropriately timely to balance process integrity with the value of open government.\nLet's consider where we are today. Central banks around the world now publish their objectives, publicly communicate their policy actions, and speak freely and openly in\npublic forums. In the case of the Federal Reserve, the chairman testifies semiannually on monetary policy, policy decisions are announced in a release immediately following\nan FOMC meeting, and the minutes of those meetings are reported on an expedited basis. The Fed also now publishes quarterly forecasts.\nAlso, the Fed publishes its balance sheet on a weekly basis and provides annually a detailed report on the financial activities of the Federal Reserve that are audited by an\nindependent public accounting firm. In addition, the Government Accountability Office audits the Federal Reserve across all its operations with the exception of, importantly,\nmonetary policy.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve System has a characteristic that is somewhat unique among central banks of the world. The system has a decentralized structure whereby\nregional, independent Reserve Banks, under the broad supervision of politically appointed governors in Washington, D.C., jointly set policy.\nThis decentralized structure, in my view, greatly enhances both the independence of the system and its transparency.\nRegional representation at the policy table provides a means for all corners of this diverse nation to weigh in on the important monetary issues influencing the economy.\nReserve Banks gather economic intelligence from around their districts representing the varied views and interests of our respective regions. And Reserve Banks are well\npositioned to bring important information back home again, communicating the Fed’s objectives in a way that enhances the understanding of their rationale.\nI strongly advocate this notion of defined transparency, which I mentioned a moment ago. I’ve seen firsthand the delicacy of the policy role the Federal Reserve plays\nopposite markets and financial institutions. The events of the last two years have exposed the fragile edifice of financial stability.\nI think the principles of transparency that should apply to the making of monetary policy include the following: Disclosure that does not do systemic harm. Disclosure that\ndoes not tend to shorten policy time horizons and open the monetary policy process to short-term political considerations. And, disclosure that does encourage a relationship\nof trust, confidence, and credibility between the public and the central bank.\nIn my view, the public interest resides in policies that influence the economy over the longer term, address economic fundamentals, and are politically neutral. I welcome\nfurther discussion on ways the Fed can be more accountable and transparent but always within the context of maintaining the monetary policy independence that has proven\neffective in the pursuit of broad economic goals.\nIn striking the right balance of independence, accountability, and transparency, we must also remain mindful of the global role of the dollar and the worldwide distribution of\nour obligations. I believe the independence of the Federal Reserve is crucial to the world’s perception that the United States will continue to pursue responsible monetary\npolicy. This perception is an essential underpinning of a calm, reasoned, and favorable assessment of U.S. country risk.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

        "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThe U.S. Economy and the Employment Challenge\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nChattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce\nChattanooga, Tennessee\nAugust 26, 2009\nThe last time I was here I delivered a speech to the Rotary Club of Chattanooga in late March of 2008. Since that time, the economic situation has\nchanged dramatically.\nA year and a half ago, as you recall, the U.S. economy was clearly slowing. But it wasn't yet apparent that we were in the midst of a deep and\nprotracted recession. Also, a major financial crisis was not part of the outlook.\nNow, evidence is mounting that the worst of the economic downturn is behind us. Today, I will talk about the economic situation and outlook at this\njuncture. I also want to take a deeper look into a critical economic issue for many Americans—and that is employment. The views I will express\ntoday are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nCurrent state of national economy\nLet me begin with the current state of the economy. Overall, the U.S. economy is improving but still fragile. Stabilization has taken hold, and the beginning stages of recovery\nare under way, in my view.\nConsumer spending has been dampened by housing market weakness and concerns about employment.\nThe attitude among the business leaders I talk to is quite cautious. Investment spending this year has declined sharply, but, according to recent data, the speed of falloff\nappears to be slowing. Also, inventories have been liquidated aggressively in the first half of the year.\nRecent improvements in the financial sector are supporting economic stabilization. Capital flows and securities issuance reflect an unwinding of the flight to safety that\noccurred last fall. Despite this improved flow of capital to riskier assets, I would say that financial conditions are still vulnerable, and the flow of credit remains weak.\nI'm concerned that commercial real estate weakness poses a serious potential risk to the economic recovery and to the banking system. Commercial real estate loan\nexposure is heavily concentrated in banks and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Commercial real estate values—that is, collateral values for loans—are being revised\ndown materially by the potent combination of increased vacancy, rent reductions, and appropriately higher capitalization rates. Further, there is a clear link between\nemployment trends (positive and negative) and commercial real estate trends.\nAs regards inflation, with continuing economic weakness and financial uncertainty, firms have very little pricing power. Headline inflation has fallen in part because of lower oil\nprices compared with a year ago. Core measures of inflation excluding food and energy costs also have been drifting lower. Looking ahead, I expect inflation will remain\ncontained.\nOutlook\nWith respect to growth, my forecast envisions a return to positive but subdued gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the medium term weighed down by significant\nadjustments to our economy. Some of these adjustments are transitional in the sense that they impede the usual forces of recovery. Among these are the rewiring of the\nfinancial sector and the need for households to save more to repair their balance sheets.\nSome of these adjustments, however, are more \"structural\" in nature. By this, I mean that the economy that emerges from this recession may not fully resemble the\nprerecession economy. In my view, it is unlikely that we will see a return of jobs lost in certain sectors, such as manufacturing. In a similar vein, the recession has been so\ndeep in construction that a reallocation of workers is likely to happen—even if not permanent. I'll discuss manufacturing and construction a bit more in a moment.\nMy forecast for a slow recovery implies a protracted period of high unemployment. And labor market weakness is a concern I hear about often as I travel around the\nSoutheast. Given this concern, I'd like to devote the remainder of my formal remarks to the challenge of unemployment and the potential for a jobless recovery.\nUnderemployment\nThis recession has had a severe impact on employment in various ways: jobs, furloughs, and number of hours worked. For example, the average manufacturing workweek\nhas fallen below 40 hours for the first time since 1983. And the number of workers employed part-time for economic reasons has increased more in this recession than in any\nsince the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) started tracking that information.\nIf one considers the people who would like a job but have stopped looking—so-called discouraged workers—and those who are working fewer hours than they want, the\nunemployment rate would move from the official 9.4 percent to 16 percent.\nWhere job losses occurred\nWhile the unemployment pain in this recession has been broad based, certain sectors have been hit particularly hard. I've already mentioned the most prominent cases,\nconstruction and manufacturing. Both fields employ a disproportionate number of men. As a result, some have called this a \"mancession.\"\nThe share of the jobs lost in construction and manufacturing is out of proportion to the share of jobs represented by these male-dominated sectors. Prior to the recession,\nconstruction and manufacturing together accounted for a little more than 15 percent of employment. Their job losses during the recession, however, account for more than 40\n\n\fpercent of all U.S. job losses. While men typically have borne most of the job losses during a recession, this recession ranks among the worst.\nSlow recovery\nClearly, it will be some time before the number of jobs in the economy returns to prerecession levels.\nThe higher share of part-time employment arguably gives employers a means to increase work hours without adding to the overall number of full-time workers. Businesses\nseem inclined to defer hiring and focus on productivity until a sustained pick-up in top-line demand is beyond doubt.\nFirms always have incentives to improve efficiency and keep a lid on costs—including labor costs. The last two recoveries have involved unusually long periods of GDP\ngrowth accomplished through productivity gains instead of employment growth. At this point, there is scant evidence that the coming recovery will break that pattern.\nThe sectors in which job losses have been most pronounced are unlikely to see a rapid return to prerecession levels of business activity, let alone prerecession levels of\nemployment. Construction, which represents about 6 percent of employment, has seen a recent activity uptick in the residential category from very low levels. But the\ninventory of unsold homes on the market is elevated. Much of this inventory will have to be absorbed before construction employment returns to any levels we might consider\n\"normal.\" Industry capacity before the recession approached 2 million housing starts on an annual basis. Starts are now hovering around 580,000.\nUnfortunately, time may not return manufacturing employment to prerecession levels. Between 1965 and 2000, manufacturing employment generally fluctuated between 16.5\nand 19.5 million jobs. The number of manufacturing jobs fell to just over 14 million in the first years of this decade and has continued to drift downward. The harsh financial\nconstraints of this recession appear to have accelerated this secular decline.\nSolutions to the unemployment problem\nThe country's employment problems are not completely intractable. Fortunately, most who are directly affected by job loss are eligible for the short-term income support of\nunemployment insurance. Benefits through that program have been extended three times since July 2008 and may be extended again.\nFor many workers, unemployment benefits provide much-needed income support to see them through a difficult job market. Some workers will have to look for a job in a new\nfield. There are some powerful forces in place that can assist those workers who need to make career changes—labor market flexibility and an educational infrastructure well\nsuited to retraining workers.\nFirst, with respect to labor market flexibility, the easier it is for workers to change employers, the faster structural adjustment can occur. U.S. workers have become\naccustomed to changing jobs. The BLS estimates that the youngest baby boomers had almost nine different jobs by the time they reached the age of 42.\nAlong with worker flexibility, worker retraining programs can also facilitate necessary adjustments. Community colleges serve an important role in preparing \"nontraditional,\"\noften older, students for new careers and in providing targeted training on a contract basis with private companies.\nIn the fall of 2007, more than a third of all postsecondary students were enrolled in community colleges, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Since the\nearly 1960s, enrollment in community colleges increased by about 750 percent—roughly four times the growth rate of enrollment in public and private four-year institutions.\nThe role that community colleges play in retooling the workforce can be seen by the bumps in enrollment during recessions. Also, enrollment in for-profit educational\ninstitutions has increased from only about 1.5 percent of postsecondary students in 1990 to about 7 percent more recently.\nIn recognition that many of the nation's unemployed will need to retool to re-enter the labor market, approximately $24 billion of federal stimulus money was allocated for\ntraining and education, according to the Workforce Alliance.\nHow Chattanooga is poised for recovery\nWith respect to our national employment challenge, Chattanooga offers a useful example—and perhaps a preview—of how labor markets will adjust as recovery takes hold.\nSince 1990, Chattanooga's employment situation has typically beaten that of the United States. But in this recession Chattanooga has been sharing the national pain. Like\nthe nation as a whole, Chattanooga has seen a disproportionate share of job losses in construction and manufacturing.\nFortunately for this area, top employers also include health and long-term care insurance companies, health care providers, and health care educators. Officials project one\nof the fastest-growing employment sectors through 2016 will be health care. Chattanooga should benefit from this growth coming out of the recession, and the local health\ncare insurance industry is also poised for more demand with the aging of the U.S. population.\nBut Chattanooga can boast of something unusual in today's economy: new manufacturing jobs. As you know, the new Volkswagen plant is expected to add some 2,000\nmanufacturing jobs to the local economy by 2011. This development runs counter to national trends, as I've already explained.\nPolicy issues\nIf my prognosis for the broad economy is correct, the pace of job restoration and growth through the medium term will be frustratingly slow. So, what can be done to address\nthe prospect of high unemployment and underemployment?\nFurther fiscal stimulus has been mentioned, but the full effects of the first stimulus package are not yet clear, and the concern over adding to the federal deficit and the\nresulting national debt is warranted.\nThe FOMC has stated its intention to keep the policy interest rate low for an extended period. I agree that this approach is needed. This policy stance should encourage more\nbusiness activity and facilitate more hiring.\nNo policy is certain to improve outcomes, and no policy is without risks. The challenge my colleagues and I face is navigating between the risk that early removal of monetary\nstimulus snuffs out the recovery and the risk that protracted monetary accommodation stokes inflation expectations that could ultimately fuel unwelcome inflationary\npressures.\n\n\fThe Fed must deal with this tension, particularly in coming quarters, as we pursue our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. I believe the overriding\nconcern should be the quality of recovery as opposed to the speed of recovery. The best answer to unemployment is restoration of a healthy, balanced, and growing\neconomy capable of producing sustainable employment. This objective will require structural adjustment in the economy and personal adjustment for many workers.\nI believe the economic outlook—including the employment picture—calls for continuing efforts to remove obstacles to the rebuilding of economic strength on solid\nfoundations. Chief among such obstacles is the still-constricted bank and securitization credit system, especially those segments that finance small business and\nhouseholds.\nI also believe progressive local community leaders can play a role in addressing the unemployment challenge. Beyond recruiting inbound investment that brings immediate\njobs, you as local leaders can continue to pursue a human capital agenda for your region. By this, I mean initiatives to advance early childhood pre-K education for three- and\nfour-year-olds, improvement of the public K–12 system, and backing of the community and technical college infrastructure that is so vital to worker skill development and\nretooling.\nI do not expect quick fixes for the unemployment challenge ahead, but I am convinced the right policy objective is sustainable employment growing out of a recovery that is\ngrounded in durable and resilient fundamentals.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

        "content": "SPEECHES\n\nOn the Economic Outlook and the Commitment to Price Stability\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRotary Club of Nashville\nNashville, Tennessee\nJuly 20, 2009\nFor my remarks this afternoon, I'll talk about how I see the economy at this juncture, the near- and medium-term outlook, and the growing concern\nabout inflation. Let me add at this point my usual disclaimer that my remarks are my thoughts alone and may not necessarily reflect the views of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nIt's especially important that I mention this caveat the day before Chairman Ben Bernanke makes his semiannual monetary policy report to\nCongress. Tomorrow the chairman will speak for the Federal Reserve System. Today, I am speaking just for myself, informed by advice from my\ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\nCurrent economy\nCurrent economic conditions are mixed at best, but the economy appears to be in stabilization mode. Stabilization necessarily precedes recovery. A\nrecovery has not yet taken hold but should begin before too long.\nI'll start with a look at manufacturing, which has been hard hit in this recession. Just last week we learned that manufacturing production was down 0.6 percent in June,\nmonth over month. In the past year, manufacturers have cut production by more than 15 percent, and the manufacturing capacity utilization rate dropped to about 65 percent,\na record low.\nHere in middle Tennessee, manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of employment. The number of manufacturing jobs here declined by about 12 percent on a yearover-year basis in May, the most recent data available. I know that many of you here today have directly felt the troubles in this important sector.\nRecent indicators of business investment are also down but are a bit less discouraging. Durable goods orders increased this spring and in May reached the highest levels in\nfour months. On the other hand, the most recent data showed the liquidation of business inventories continuing, but the pace has slowed.\nConsumer spending absorbs about two-thirds of economic output, and the recent picture in this area is mostly negative. After taking price changes into account, it appears\nthat retail spending fell again in June. Restaurants, department stores, and building materials retailers all posted month-to-month declines. Overall, retail results are in line\nwith the ongoing weakness in consumer spending we have been seeing.\nThere is also indication of worsening consumer confidence. The University of Michigan's July report indicated that consumer sentiment fell sharply in recent weeks, reversing\nthe gains seen in May and June. Growing consumer pessimism has been reported in other survey data. It appears that expectations of future economic conditions, and\nparticularly employment prospects, are weighing on attitudes.\nAs for housing, permits and new home starts in June improved markedly compared with previous months, and the large inventory of houses for sale has been pared back\nsomewhat. But the housing sector is still under great stress. Reflecting a persistent pace of foreclosures, the percentage of distressed sales remains high—about one in\nthree sales in May. All in all, this information suggests a slower pace of decline in a still weak residential sector.\nData on the overall economy suggest the same trend of slowing decline. I, along with my team in Atlanta, believe real gross domestic product (GDP) fell slightly in the second\nquarter. This performance represents substantial progress coming off a contraction of 5.5 percent (annualized) in the first quarter.\nThe most recent monthly labor market report was disappointing, but employment tends to lag improvements in economic performance. Nothing in the incoming data has\naltered our view that the economy is nearing a bottom and will soon begin a very slow recovery.\nFinancial market healing\nIf stabilization is to lead to sustained recovery, the health of financial markets is crucial. In this regard, I see notable signs of improvement.\nFor example, most short-term money markets have seen rising volume, increased liquidity, and less concern with counterparty risk.\nIn the corporate bond market, spreads have declined and lowered the cost of capital for investment-grade businesses.\nOur credit markets include both banks and the very important securitization markets. Securitization markets have been coming back gradually from a base late last year of\nnearly zero. Total asset-backed security issuance in the second quarter of 2009 was $49 billion, which is 14 times larger than during the frozen market conditions of the fourth\nquarter of 2008.\nEquity markets were up globally in the second quarter. While the calendar of initial public offerings remains weak, stock issuance in the second quarter tripled compared with\nthe first quarter of 2009 and hit the highest level for the past year and a half.\nMuch of the recent equity issuance activity was capital raises of large banks. It's positive news that the banks participating in the so-called stress tests have raised a\nsubstantial portion of the required capital. Some banks have begun repaying their Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds to the U.S. Treasury. Also, use of the Fed's\nspecial credit facilities has fallen by $500 billion since March of this year.\n\n\fDespite this progress, the financial sector remains in a fragile state. So far this year, 57 U.S. banks have failed, including 13 in the Southeast. Banks in this region suffer from\noverconcentration of loans backed by residential and commercial real estate.\nOutlook\nNow, let me speak to the question of the outlook from here. Often a deep recession is followed by a sharp rebound in business and overall economic activity. Unfortunately,\nas I look ahead, I do not foresee this trajectory. I expect real growth to resume in the second half and progress at a modest pace. I do not see a strong recovery in the\nmedium term.\nThere are risks to even this rather subdued forecast. The risk I'm watching most closely is commercial real estate. There is a heavy schedule of commercial real estate\nfinancings coming due in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The CMBS (commercial real estate mortgage-backed securities) market is very weak, and banks generally have no appetite\nto roll over loans on properties that have lost value in the recession. Refinancing problems will not directly affect GDP—it's commercial construction that factors into GDP—\nbut I'm concerned problems in commercial real estate finance could adversely affect the otherwise improving banking and insurance sectors.\nRemoving obstacles to growth\nI'd like to elaborate further on my thinking regarding this forecast of an anemic recovery in the medium term. I will argue that growth is the natural state for the U.S. economy,\nand growth in the medium term will be slowed by structural impediments that must be removed or attenuated.\nGrowth is the natural state because market competition requires continuous innovation—product innovation, technological innovation, new business models, and\ndevelopment of new markets. Businesspeople—especially those in publicly held companies—understand that over the longer term it's either grow or disappear.\nIt follows then that resumption and acceleration of growth depends on removal of obstacles. By obstacles, I mean conditions that get in the way of a natural pace of growth.\nI see a number of obstacles whose removal will take some time. For example, the healing of the banking system will take time. Working off excess housing inventory will take\ntime. The reallocation of labor to productive and growing sectors of the economy will take time. It will take time to complete the deleveraging of American households and the\nrestoration of consumer balance sheets.\nIn short, I believe the economy must undergo significant structural adjustments. We're coming out of a severe recession, and it's not too much an exaggeration to say the\neconomy is undergoing a makeover. We must build a more solid foundation for our economy than consumer spending fueled by excessive credit—excessive household\nleverage—built on a house price bubble.\nThe surviving financial system must find a new posture of risk taking. The balance of consumption and investment must adjust, with investment being financed by greater\ndomestic saving. The distribution of employment must adjust to match worker skills, including newly acquired skills, with jobs in growth markets. Some industrial plant and\nequipment must be taken offline to remove excess and higher-cost capacity.\nAs I said, these adjustments will take time and will suppress growth prospects in the process. I believe the economy will underperform its long-term potential for a while\nbecause of the obstacles to growth that must be removed, adjustments it must undergo.\nMany observers see substantial slack in the economy that could persist for some years. Economists' more formal term for slack is “output gap.” We at the Atlanta Fed see a\nmeaningful output gap developing, but in our view it is smaller than would normally be associated with the weak pace of growth we expect over the next couple of years\nbecause all the obstacles to the natural pace of growth already mentioned have brought down the economy's potential for the medium term.\nInflation risks\nThis observation leads me to some comments on inflation.\nThe inflation statistics have fluctuated in recent months, mainly as a result of volatile energy prices. But the most recent core inflation indicators continue to point to an\ninflation trend somewhere just below 2 percent—not much different from where it has been for some time now.\nAt this juncture, my assessment is that inflationary and deflationary risks are roughly balanced.\nI don't believe businesses, broadly speaking, have much pricing power. I'm hearing this belief anecdotally. Recently, our regional executives asked a wide range of business\ncontacts in the Southeast about their ability to raise prices in this economy. The great majority of respondents reported that they were not able to raise prices, and some are\nhaving to renegotiate contracts to lower prices.\nStill, I recognize that concerns about inflation risks have recently risen in some quarters, and I would like to comment on those concerns.\nInflation pessimists—those predicting alarmingly higher inflation—point to growing federal deficits and the substantial growth of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet since\nlast October. More precisely, they note the enormous increase of excess bank reserves on the liability side of the Fed's balance sheet. The argument is that surely this rapid\ngrowth of the monetary base and balance sheet must translate eventually, and possibly quite soon, into outsized growth of the money supply. This growth in the money\nsupply is inflationary if not reversed fairly soon. That's the argument.\nTo carry this argument a little further, the concern is that banks will begin to lend the large quantity of reserves that exist today, putting the money into circulation as the\neconomy picks up. The growth in spending that could result from this increase in money could push against the economy's capacity constraints in a way that creates\ninflationary pressures, according to the inflation pessimists.\nAltered role of bank reserves\nLet me draw attention to an important policy change that has altered the relationship between the quantity of bank reserves and overall spending in the economy.\nSince last October, the Federal Reserve has been paying banks interest on their reserve deposits. This shift means that banks are more likely to hold reserves with the Fed\nthan in the past and less inclined to look for a way to invest or lend excess reserves. Now banks earn on reserves where previously they didn't. So now there is less direct\n\n\flinkage between growth in the size of the Fed's balance sheet and inflationary pressures. In other words, the absolute size of the Fed's balance sheet isn't as scary as it was\nbefore.\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not saying that the current size of the balance sheet is necessarily the most appropriate. What I am saying is one should not assume at this point that\nextraordinary measures to shrink the balance sheet are required to contain inflationary pressures.\nIn addition, let me highlight two points from the minutes of the most recent FOMC meeting. First, the size of the balance sheet is currently expected to peak later in the year\nand then begin to decrease. This decrease will occur as various liquidity programs are phased out or decline in use and as long-term asset purchase programs are\ncompleted.\nSecond, the FOMC is actively studying mechanisms to deliberately shrink the size of the balance sheet should the need arise, and to do this without causing disruptions to\nthe economy. According to the minutes of the last FOMC meeting, a top Fed priority is “ensuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn smoothly and at the\nappropriate time.”\nIn my view, some inflation pessimists are not giving weight to the changed mechanics of monetary policy transmission to the broad economy. For some years now the Fed\nhas used interest rates—interest rate policy—to influence economic activity and inflation. Paying the banks interest on their reserves allows the Fed to tighten monetary\nconditions by resetting this floor interest rate without direct manipulation of the size of the balance sheet.\nNonetheless, it's important that we policymakers remember that rising inflation fears can evolve into inflation expectations on which businesspeople and consumers act.\nModern inflation fighting by policymakers is substantially about anchoring expectations. The bulwark against rising inflation expectations is the Fed's credibility. By this, I'm\nreferring to the belief that the monetary authorities have the tools—and the commitment—to act against inflation.\nI want to assure you the Fed has several tools and is readying itself to act on the balance sheet when the time comes. And I am very confident of the FOMC's commitment to\nprice stability. I recognize, however, it's easy to say one is committed to act in advance of the need to act. Circumstances at the time may make the need less clear and the\ndecision more complicated. So, if the incremental step of announcing a formal inflation target would serve to calm current fears and prove convincing on an ongoing basis, I\nwould favor such a move. I think that discussion needs to continue.\nLet me summarize my argument here today. The economy is stabilizing and recovery will begin in the second half. The recovery will be weak compared with historic\nrecoveries from recession. The recovery will be weak because the economy must make structural adjustments before the healthiest possible rate of growth can be achieved.\nWhile this adjustment process is going on in the medium term, I believe inflation and deflation are roughly equal risks and require careful monitoring. Slack in the economy\nwill suppress inflation. And inflation is unlikely to result—by direct causation—from the recent growth of the Fed's balance sheet. In any event, the Fed has a number of tools\nbeing readied to unwind the policies used to fight the recession, and it will be some time before their use is appropriate.\nI will end with those thoughts and would be happy to take your questions.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Press release • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\nRELATED LINKS ON OTHER SITES: Interest on reserves FAQ\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nNational Association of Securities Professionals\nAnnual Pension and Financial Services Conference\nAtlanta, Ga.\nJune 11, 2009\nIn recent weeks, sentiment about the U.S. economy has clearly improved. A modicum of optimism has returned.\nI'm as ready as you are for a real turn of the economy. For several weeks now we've been hearing of so-called \"green shoots\"—that is, little signs of\nlife in the economy that foretell a recovery. This imagery coincides with spring having sprung. It seems very human. Our spirits rise with the better\nweather, the warmer temperatures, the return of baseball, and we see encouraging signs all about us. As I said, I'm ready for recovery, but I've got\nto ask: Could we be kidding ourselves? Is it real?\nIn my remarks today, I'll respond to that question first by providing an up-to-date fix—as current as the data allow—on the economic situation. Then,\nI'll talk about the most serious risks I see in the economy along with my baseline outlook for a near-term recovery. I'll close with some views on the\ntension I perceive between short-term economic prospects—which are net positive—and longer-term structural challenges that, in my view, must be\nfaced with a sense of urgency.\nThe tug and pull between immediate prospects for the economy and over-the-horizon threats seem to me to be captured in the question of the moment: What's causing rising\nterm U.S. Treasury yields? And in what way, if at all, should policy react? Here I must repeat my usual disclaimer: The views that follow are mine alone and don't necessarily\nreflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nCurrent fix on the economy\nMy view of the current economy is mixed. For the most part, the economy is still in decline, but the pace of decline has clearly slowed. I'd like to make a distinction between\nstabilization and recovery, and I believe we're seeing signs of stabilization.\nAs regards stabilization, I'd like to highlight four areas: employment, housing, consumer spending, and manufacturing.\nEmployment: Unemployment insurance claims data, released this morning for the week ending June 6, reinforced a two-month trend in labor markets, and that is, layoffs are\ngradually decelerating. However, claims remain near record-high levels, and firms' reluctance to hire has lifted the most recent unemployment rate to 9.4 percent in May.\nHousing: Many of today's problems started with housing, and by most measures a clear recovery in the housing market has yet to emerge. My contacts here in the Southeast\nconfirm the most recent data on the national housing market, namely that house prices are still falling, but the rate of decline has moderated somewhat.\nImproved affordability combined with historically low mortgage rates and a new first-time homebuyers' tax credit have helped move a portion of the huge inventory of unsold\nhomes off the market. Preliminary results from the survey of homebuilders and Realtors in the Southeast conducted by the Atlanta Fed indicate more optimism that sales will\npick up in the future.\nConsumer spending: In data released this morning, the Census Bureau reported that retail sales were up 0.5 percent in May after posting declines in March and April. Some\nof the increase may be related to higher gasoline prices. And there were areas of spending weakness. Overall, last month's retail sales numbers were more positive than\nnegative. But compared with May of last year, sales are down a striking 9.7 percent. So sales are nudging higher but from very low levels.\nWith consumers holding back, the personal saving rate in April climbed to 5.7 percent, marking the first time savings exceeded 5 percent of disposable income in more than\n14 years.\nManufacturing: The industrial side of the economy has been especially hard hit this year, and the sector remains under considerable stress. But there are recent signs—such\nas the latest Institute for Supply Management purchasing managers survey—that the rate of manufacturing decline may be slowing too.\nFinancial markets\nAs so many have said, a return to economic growth depends on working financial markets, and there's been recent progress in several areas, including with banks, shortterm funding, corporate markets, and securitization markets.\nThe number of so-called problem banks is elevated and likely to keep climbing. However, there's been some better news from the banking industry. For instance, the\nSupervisory Capital Assessment Program, also known as stress tests, has provided us with a better handle on the capital buffer the largest banks would need to remain well\ncapitalized and able to lend if the economy performs worse than expected.\nFollowing up on the stress test results, the Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced that the 10 banks required to bolster their capital have submitted plans to meet\ntheir requirements. Then on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury announced that 10 of the largest institutions participating in the capital purchase program had met requirements to\nrepay the government for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds provided to them. I view these developments as signs that the banking system is healing, and\nrising confidence in the banking system is justified.\n\n\fMarkets for short-term funding also have improved, including the interbank lending markets and commercial paper markets. Spreads between the London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) and the overnight index swap rate have declined to levels that are close to precrisis levels.\nCorporate bond issuance has increased recently. Although U.S. Treasury rates have been on the rise, spreads between Treasury yields and rates paid by corporate\nborrowers have narrowed somewhat. Overall, the cost of capital for highly rated businesses has come down.\nFinally, as regards securitization markets, the asset-backed securities (ABS) market collapsed in 2008 but this year has begun to gradually revive with the aid of public\nprograms designed to jump-start the securitization markets.\nIssuance of new ABS, including credit card, auto and student loans, and equipment leases, has totaled more than $40 billion since the Fed launched the Term Asset-Backed\nSecurities Loan Facility (TALF) in March. This activity is still far short of the $200 billion annual ABS issuance before the financial crisis, but it represents a marked\nimprovement from last year. Furthermore, risk spreads on ABS have been declining steadily this year and should help ease the cost of credit for both households and\nbusinesses.\nWhile credit market functioning has improved, the picture I've just painted of our current economic environment is framed with caution. At this point, there's still a debate\nabout whether business activity has reached a bottom.\nEven when the recovery is well under way, I expect an extended period of sluggish growth. And the initial phase of the recovery may \"feel\" like a recession for many\nhouseholds and businesses.\nForecasts and risks\nIn the normal course of our work, the Atlanta Fed produces a forecast of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation. Like most forecasters, we see the economy\nbeginning to recover in the second half of this year.\nFor the medium and longer term, however, I expect growth will be relatively subdued for some time after it turns positive. My thinking is the economy has to go through\nstructural adjustments that could lower the trend rate of growth for the recovery's first couple of years at least.\nMoreover, I believe there are ongoing threats that pose downside risks to sustained recovery.\nAt the broadest level, global economic weakness constitutes a continuing risk. This recession knows no borders, and the downturn has become especially severe in Japan,\nEurope, and certain developing markets such as Eastern Europe. Though there are promising signs in some countries, the International Monetary Fund still projects global\ngrowth this year will be –1.3 percent, the most severe worldwide contraction since World War II.\nDomestically, commercial real estate is a problem for the economy and problematic for my outlook. My forecast takes into account worsening commercial real estate—office,\nretail, hotel, and warehouse, all of which are under stress. But since this is an emerging story, I don't think we should underestimate the scope of the problems of commercial\nreal estate and the potential disruption to a still stressed banking system.\nFinally, in an economy built for personal consumption, there is the risk consumer psychology and resulting consumption could turn negative. Consumer sentiment regarding\nthe economy has improved but remains very low by recovery standards and could reverse with adverse turns in the data or worsening market conditions.\nEven without such a reversal, several factors are likely to continue to hold back consumer spending. These include weak labor markets, pressures to repair household\nbalance sheets, and still tight credit conditions. Going forward, I doubt that the financial system will accommodate the degree of household leverage consumers enjoyed\nbefore mid-2007. So I'm expecting a period of adjustment.\nResolving long-term imbalances\nAs mentioned at the outset, U.S. Treasury rates have risen recently. As you know, Treasury yields influence a broader array of market rates, most importantly mortgage rates.\nThe recent rise in Treasury rates has brought sharper focus to the requirements of recovery, in terms of both policy and the real economy. And these requirements compete,\nto some extent, with the requirements of transition or, more precisely, rebalancing.\nThe rise of Treasury rates, or yields, has been characterized as both good and bad omens. Various interpretations have been put forward. To wit:\nThe rise of term Treasury rates reflects the improved outlook for real growth.\nThe rise of term Treasury rates signals declining risk aversion and the unwinding of the safe haven inflows that occurred last fall.\nThe rate rise demonstrates increased inflation expectations related to concerns of monetization of the burgeoning federal debt.\nThe rise is evidence of decreased demand on the part of foreign investors.\nThese and possibly other explanations may all be factors in the market. I'm sympathetic to the good omen explanations—that the rise is connected to the improved outlook—\nbut I don't rule out that there is something here to monitor very carefully. The steepening of the yield curve may reflect growing concern over the nation's ability to correct\nprofound structural imbalances; that is, to combine recovery with transition.\nAn immediate recovery that does not bring with it substantial progress in rebalancing the economy for the longer term will not be durable. And failure to effectively come to\ngrips with the requirements of rebalancing could result in unwanted inflation and chronic economic underperformance.\nThe rebalancing agenda has been widely expounded. Among rebalancing imperatives, the U.S. citizenry must rebalance consumption and savings. Connected to this, the\ncountry must rebalance consumption and investment. And above all, the worsening fiscal imbalance must be addressed.\nHigher nominal rates in the term Treasuries market can be seen as an expression of creeping doubt that the American polity, and more specifically the policy community, is\nup to the sacrifices, tradeoff decisions, and the courage of convictions the situation requires.\n\n\fThe concerns about our economic path are crystallized in doubts expressed in some quarters about the Federal Reserve's ability to fulfill its obligation to deliver low and\nstable inflation in the face of very large current and prospective federal deficits. In a word, the concerns are about monetization of the resulting federal debt.\nI do not dismiss these concerns out of hand. I also recognize that the task of pursuing the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and sustainable growth will be greatly\ncomplicated should deliberate and timely action to address our fiscal imbalances fail to materialize. But I have full confidence in the Federal Reserve's ability and resolve to\nmeet its inflation objectives in whatever environment presents itself. Of the many risks the U.S. and global economies still confront, I firmly believe the Fed losing sight of its\ninflation objectives is not among them.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

I do not expect a strong recovery, but I do expect the economic\ncontraction we're now experiencing to give way to slow and tentative growth as early as the third quarter.\nRisks remain to this cautiously optimistic outlook. I am concerned about the commercial real estate sector and how its performance could affect the\nbanking system, which I addressed in a recent speech. I am concerned that continuing job losses will reverse the slight indications of improving\nconsumer confidence. And I continue to watch house prices with concern. House prices continue to fall, as indicated by the Case-Shiller index. Along with these domestic\nrisks, global risks are also considered in my outlook given downward revisions in forecasts for gross domestic product growth in most major economies.\nNonetheless, I think this is an appropriate juncture to give more detailed and practical thought to the world we want to construct after this difficult period. In my remarks today,\nI plan to share my personal views (not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee) on a basic question about the postcrisis environment. It\nis: What regulatory environment will both align with the reality of financial markets and adequately address recent failings?\nI trust this topic is appropriate for a conference in honor of Hyman Minsky. As you know, he devoted much of his academic life to the forces that give rise to financial instability\nand the important role that institutional arrangements play in both the promotion of, and the remedy to, financial instability.\nFinancial markets and securitization\nThere has been much discussion about restoring a commercial bank–dominant financial system, downsizing large systemically critical financial institutions to eliminate the\n\"too big to fail\" problem, and limiting the role of securitization as part of a shrinking of the shadow banking system. These are examples of opinions that range from\npredictions to prescriptions on what the financial system will look like.\nThe financial system has already undergone what some would call radical change. I'm referring to the reduction of the number of stand-alone investment banks, the\nconversion of some investment banks to bank holding companies, and the forced consolidation of the commercial bank sector. I'm cautious about predicting such substantial\nchange going forward. I expect the financial system to continue to involve a mix of capital markets and institutions, but with a wider array of institutions falling under\nregulatory supervision. Furthermore, I take it as given that there will continue to be large international institutions with operations in many countries, that is to say, regulatory\njurisdictions around the globe.\nLooking ahead, I see an ongoing role for securitization and the originate-to-distribute model. Securitization markets have shrunk dramatically over the last year and a half and\nin some cases have shut down altogether. I expect these markets to return, perhaps in simpler form and with more accountability.\nI expect securitization to continue because this form of financial intermediation developed in response to needs and realities that have not disappeared. I was a commercial\nbanker in the 1980s and I remember well the onset of the practice of balance sheet allocation according to return on assets and ultimately return on equity. Commercial\nbanks were, and remain, caught in a dilemma of wanting to serve their clients by providing loans, but not always being able to justify booking very competitively priced loans\non their balance sheets.\nThis tension gave rise to various securitization, distribution, and asset liquidity strategies including off-balance-sheet vehicles, such as the now notorious structured\ninvestment vehicles. The excesses that arose need to be addressed, of course, but the underlying economics of 12-to-one leverage banking continue to dictate that assets\nretained on balance sheet meet net interest margin and return requirements. Banks must compete against all businesses for capital and seek competitive returns and\nearnings per share growth. In this respect, they do not compete only against other banks.\nSecuritization has brought benefits to consumers that cannot be easily matched by a bank that originates a loan to hold. In particular, mortgage securitization, which began in\nthe 1980s, has led to lower mortgage rates, advancing the social goal of homeownership by improving affordability. In more recent years, however, mortgage-backed\nsecurities have been engineered and resecuritized into increasingly complex structures known as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs and even CDOs squared.\nInvestors in these securities relied on credit rating agencies to assess risk, and banks took advantage of regulatory arbitrage to conduct this business off balance sheet. The\nresulting lack of transparency regarding the value of the securities and the financial condition of the banks holding them was a central factor in the financial turmoil of the last\n18 months.\nGoing forward, markets and investors will show a new awareness of the potential for complexity, opacity, and risk in securitized instruments. This awareness, in and of itself,\nhas and will continue to provide incentives for the creation of simpler and more transparent securitization structures. For these and other reasons, I expect our securitization\nsystem to be reformed but not replaced.\n\n\fAgile oversight required\nThe regulatory environment we construct in the coming months must be suited to a financial system that remains a mix of capital markets and institutions—formal and\nshadow banking—with an array of institutional operating models.\nAgainst this reality, a system that responds to the perceived faults of the precrisis financial world by imposing a set of rules about what behaviors are prohibited is almost\ncertain to amount to \"fighting the last war.\" I do not believe we can easily anticipate where the next source of stress in financial markets will arise.\nIn my view, the postcrisis environment will require agile oversight. This regulatory approach should stress actively managing risk as it evolves with the associated potential for\nan institution failing versus an approach that focuses on avoiding failure.\nFollowing this logic, the regulatory environment we construct should be a well-balanced mix of rules and principles guiding flexible response and should also give a\nmeaningful role to market discipline. In an ideal world, effective market discipline necessarily allows for failure in a system in which no institution is too big (or interconnected,\nor complex, or operationally critical) to fail. It will take some time to achieve this ideal situation.\nSeveral policy actions over the last year and a half have been about avoiding the failure of a large, systemically critical institution. It's important to emphasize that some of\nthese actions took place in the absence of resolution authority, that is, the authority of a regulator to manage the failure of an insolvent institution in a purposeful and orderly\nmanner.\nIn simple terms, resolution involves these steps: 1) seizing control of the entity, 2) finding an acquirer or acquirers, 3) selling off assets, 4) stabilizing funding arrangements,\nincluding insured depositors and counterparty exposures, 5) working out unsold assets, 6) allocating losses to shareholders, bondholders, wholesale depositors, and other\nclaimants, and 7) managing final liquidation and shutdown, if required.\nThough this list sounds relatively straightforward, aspects of it are extraordinarily complex. At the core of the systemic risk issue is the fact that banks and other highly\nleveraged financial institutions are involved in a complex network of two-way, short-term funding arrangements. The failure of a large interconnected financial institution\nthreatens the funding of its counterparties, which then threatens their counterparties, and so on.\nThe metaphor that seems apt is a chain of falling dominoes. Any robust resolution process must come to grips with the potential for these sorts of network spillovers and\ninclude mechanisms for short-circuiting the potential cascade of counterparty failures when a lead domino falls.\nIt seems to me that this type of resolution of a large, globally integrated and diversified financial institution is new territory for regulators and involves some challenges that\nhaven't been faced. Ideally the process would be substantially accomplished in a short period of time with as little expense to the taxpayer as possible. Some commentators\nhave suggested that \"a short period of time\" be defined as something along the lines of \"over a weekend.\" Given the required scope and degree of integration with multiple\nnational economies, that description of speed may be unrealistic.\nThe challenge (or problem) of resolution can be summarized as follows: The entity is not just a domestic financial institution, but a collection of many domestic institutions, all\nwith cross-border connections. These entities in aggregate involve hundreds or more legal vehicles, operating across a range of business lines that are not easily separable,\nin as many sovereign legal and regulatory structures, each interested in orderly resolution in its jurisdiction. Further, there may be (is likely to be) no single buyer that is\nqualified and acceptable to all. A resolution exercise of this magnitude has not been performed before.\nYet, without a believable resolution capability, the too-big-to-fail problem isn't reduced. The problem becomes \"too big (interconnected, complex, etc.) to resolve.\"\nThis challenge suggests resolution planning should be a continuous effort on the part of regulators. Practices might include \"what-if\" consultation with national authorities\nwhere the biggest offshore operations are located, resolution simulations to identify potential problems in advance, and working with institutions and host governments to\nachieve cleaner and simpler legal structures that are resolution-ready. By resolution-ready, I'm envisioning legal vehicle structures that wrap the assets and business units of\norganic businesses into entities that can be easily evaluated and transferred in the event of a necessary disposal.\nThese are just top-of-mind ideas. My point is I'm urging careful thought on the implementation and execution capabilities required to limit systemic risk. In assessing the\nproliferating opinions about regulatory reform and focus, we should ask, how would you operationalize it?\nThe financial crisis in this country has resulted in financial industry consolidation. The effect of industry consolidation is greater concentration without, as yet, much reduction\nof systemic risk. The preferable direction is the opposite—toward less concentration.\nIdeas have been floated, but there is not yet much consensus on how to accomplish deconcentration. Forced downsizing and breakup is an option. I have concerns about\nsuch an approach. It strikes me as a drastic measure that could unfairly penalize relatively healthy and successful institutions.\nAn alternative could be a scheme of escalating supervisory attention as a financial institution approaches and exceeds thresholds of systemic risk. This approach might\nprovide a check on institutions and be a disincentive to becoming a potential systemic problem.\nNo return to simpler times\nIn my remarks, I have tried to contribute—based on my experience as a banker turned policymaker—constructive thoughts for the architects of the postcrisis financial and\nregulatory world. Next month, the Atlanta Fed hosts a conference at Jekyll Island, Ga. The conference will take place where about a century ago many of the ideas leading to\nthe Federal Reserve System were deliberated. Those meetings were held in 1910 in the aftermath of a financial crisis that bears strong resemblance to our current\nexperience.\nComing off the turbulence of 2007 through 2009, I can appreciate the yearning for a simpler era. But the future financial architecture and the regulatory approach that lines up\nwith it must be constructed, in my view, to be durable, evolve with inevitable change, and be equal to the reality of the financial sector that will survive this period. I expect the\nfinancial system to retain its diverse elements including securitization markets, large globally integrated institutions, and vigorous innovation.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\n\fRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart's biography • Press release • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

        "content": "SPEECHES\n\nOn Credit, Trade, and Food Stability\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nGlobal Interdependence Center Conference on Food and Water: Basic Challenges to International Stability\nParis, France\nMarch 26, 2009\nIn the United States today there are growing social and political tensions between those who identify with the mainstream public—often called Main\nStreet—and the financial sector, often lumped together as Wall Street. Many of my country's citizens see their interests as disconnected from the\nbanks and financial markets.\nIn the past few months, I've delivered several speeches with the message that functioning credit markets are absolutely necessary for economic\nrecovery. With a global recession and ongoing and comprehensive interventions aimed at restoring financial stability, I believe it's important for\neveryone to understand the linkages between credit markets and the broader economy.\nYour theme of food and water stability offers me another way to make my point about the interconnection of credit and economic activity. In my\nremarks, I will offer my views as a central banker on how problems in credit markets have dampened global trade, including trade in that most\nelemental of traded goods—food.\nTrade and finance\nI'd like to begin with some background on trade and credit markets. The fall of trade barriers and the rise of market economies, especially those in Asia and Eastern Europe,\nhave driven rapid growth of international trade in recent decades. The value of merchandise trade in 2008 was about $16 trillion, according to the World Trade Organization.\nBy some estimates, merchandise trade rose from 16 percent in 1983 to 25 percent in 2008 as a percentage of gross global product.\nImportantly, about 90 percent of cross-border trade transactions involved some form of credit (as opposed to cash settlement). So functioning credit markets have been and\nremain crucial to the flow of goods and services around the world.\nTrade-related credit is now supplied primarily by banks using the instrument of the documentary letter of credit, whose purpose is to secure payment for the exporter. Letters\nof credit guarantee that an importer is able to pay and allow exporters to load cargo for shipments with the assurance of getting paid. Pre-export and post-shipment funded\ncredit is tied to the self-liquidating feature of letters of credit.\nA significant majority of trade finance is handled by private sector banks and is highly concentrated among a small number of lead institutions. Furthermore, there are\nanecdotal reports about the disappearance of the secondary market in trade credits and country exposure.\nExport credit agencies, which are often state run, tend to step up to play a countercyclical role by supporting export transactions when their domestic banks pull back. Export\ncredit agencies assume risks that private lenders are unwilling or unable to accept and handle a sizeable portion—although a minority—of global trade financing.\nThis financing infrastructure made possible decades of trade expansion that came to a sudden halt in the fourth quarter of 2008. Since that time, many countries have\nreported double-digit declines in trade in nominal value terms, with real physical volume also declining.\nEconomists expect trade to decline during an economic slowdown. But the recent sharp contraction of trade appears to be far more severe than would be expected given the\ndecline in global economic activity.\nI believe some of the fall in international trade can be attributed to the disruption of the interbank credit system. The marked reduction of interbank lending appetite has been\nassociated more with the market for short-term liquidity, but it also has affected trade credit. With the interbank liquidity crisis, banks have moved to reduce overall\ncounterparty exposure including trade credit.\nPricing also has been affected and adjusted upward based on perceptions of increased risk. According to the International Monetary Fund, more than 70 percent of banks\nsaid that charges for various types of letters of credit have risen in the past year. And the percentage is higher for trade-related secured lending facilities in which goods\ntraded serve as collateral. Trade credit remains available in many cases, but its higher cost means fewer transactions are getting done.\nThe recent sharp decline of commodity prices also has affected trade financing. Volatile commodity prices have undermined confidence in the value of commodity cargo.\nThere are reports of commodity goods piling up in the physical channels of trade because of trade finance closing down.\nTrade finance used to be less affected by macro financial instability. But since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, trade finance has become more sensitive to generalized\nliquidity squeezes.\nThe Asian crisis a decade ago was a defining moment in the evolution of trade finance. With the broad-based disinvestment from emerging markets during that period, the\nthreat of contagion among borrowers alarmed international lenders. Capital account instability played a significant role during this period—more than during prior episodes of\ninstability.\nIn 1998, at the peak of the financial crisis in Indonesia, international trade finance for imports emerged as a problem. In that case, international banks reportedly refused to\nconfirm letters of credit opened by local banks because of an overall loss of confidence in the banking system.\n\n\fSince this episode, trade credit has tended not to be distinguished from other forms of exposure by creditors and, as a result, is now treated as just another form of shortterm credit.\nThe global food chain and credit\nNow, let me add a few remarks about trade in food, which of course is a basic life necessity. According to the United Nations, food trade amounted to nearly $800 billion in\n2007, or close to 6 percent of global trade. As a significant component of overall trade, food trade is also affected by problems with trade credit. Contraction of international\ntrade in food commodities is a serious concern.\nFood represents from 10 to 20 percent of consumer spending in industrialized nations, but as much as 60 to 80 percent in developing economies. Many emerging countries\ndepend on imports for a significant share of their food supply. As a result, some of these countries are highly vulnerable to contraction in food trade credit.\nMy home country has a major interest in this issue. The United States is one of the world's major exporters of food commodities. In the fourth quarter of last year, U.S. food\nexports fell 23 percent quarter over quarter.\nBeyond food exports, U.S. economic growth early last year was supported by overall exports, which held up until the sudden collapse in the fourth quarter. In my economic\noutlook for the remainder of 2009, I do not expect a sudden return of exports as a driver of recovery in the United States.\nAn obvious conclusion is the world is interconnected not just by the flow of physical trade but also through the flow of trade credit.\nSteps to address financial issues\nIn the public square of the United States, the tension over government actions to stabilize the banking and financial system has intensified in recent weeks. Much of the\nreaction to certain developments is understandable but, in my view, draws attention away from what must be the fixed focus of policy—to return the banking and financial\nsystem to health.\nFurthermore, the framing of the problem has been, perhaps naturally, mostly domestic. As a consequence, consideration of damage to the global trading system has taken a\nback seat for the most part.\nMy purpose today has been to bring attention to this dimension of the financial and economic crisis that besets us and to reemphasize the centrality of stabilizing banking\nsystems. Banks are a vital element of the international trading system.\nMany actions have been taken to stabilize the U.S. financial system, and further very important measures are in train. For instance, the removal of legacy \"toxic\" assets from\nbank balance sheets is an essential step. The Treasury's plan announced Monday should address this issue. I believe the capital adequacy assessment program, which\nsome have called stress tests, will establish a baseline of consistency with regard to balance sheet weakness and capital needs going forward. Finally, I welcome\nadjustments to fair value treatment of assets trading in illiquid markets that the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued for comment last week.\nThe subject matter of this conference—food stability—serves to elevate the priority of restoring full functioning of the trade finance system through continuing efforts to fix our\nvarious national banking systems. Food stability—or its inverse, food instability—tends to grab our attention and bring needed focus on what must be done.\nInternational trade has lifted millions of people out of poverty. But that progress is at risk. The weakened fundamentals of banks and the resulting diminished availability and\nhigher cost of credit have become weak links in the chain of global trade. By restoring functioning credit markets, I believe these weaknesses can be repaired.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Dennis Lockhart's biography • World Trade Organization • Speaker's Bureau • Atlanta Fed speeches\n\n\f"

        "content": "SPEECHES\n\nOn Real Estate and Other Risks to the Economic Outlook\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nGreater Miami Chamber of Commerce\nMiami, Florida\nMarch 4, 2009\nThanks for inviting me to be your speaker for the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce Trustee Luncheon. I appreciate this chance to speak to the\nbusiness leadership here in your city.\nAlready this year I have given several speeches on the economy, and in my earlier remarks to other groups I provided a picture of a U.S. economy\nthat was very weak but in a position to begin a modest recovery during the second half of the year.\nAlso, in these speeches I talked about a number of risks to this outlook. In my remarks today, I will elaborate on two of those risks, specifically\nresidential and, especially, commercial real estate.\nI believe this focus should interest you since real estate is a very important contributor to south Florida's economy and, for that matter, to the\nSoutheast region overall. Problems in residential real estate are well known. But with continued economic weakness I'm increasingly paying\nattention to commercial real estate.\nDeclining commercial real estate markets could put further pressure on already strained financial institutions and markets. And overcoming problems in the financial sector is\ncentral to achieving economic recovery.\nAs a policymaker, I feel the need to ground my views in a sober, unvarnished assessment of reality. But I do want to leave you with a sense that the Fed is ready and able to\nrespond decisively to emergent problems in the economy and that the Fed's actions are buttressed by other public policy programs and vice versa. Let me lay the foundation\nfor this discussion with a summary of the state of the U.S. economy and my near-term outlook.\nI must state up front that these remarks are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe economy\nLooking broadly at the national economy, the recent numbers have been discouraging. Just last Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis announced gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) contracted by 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008—worse than the 3.8 percent decline shown in the preliminary numbers.\nOther incoming data give little reason to be upbeat about the immediate future. Unemployment continues to rise. Unemployment insurance claims have been high—worse\nthan generally expected. Consumer spending has declined sharply since last fall, especially spending on durable goods such as autos. Businesses have scaled back\ninvestment spending.\nIn the housing sector, January home sales reports—both new and existing—were well off December levels. Housing starts have fallen from a peak rate approaching 2 million\nto an annual run rate below 500,000. The pullback in new construction is probably a necessary evil to bring down elevated house inventories.\nAmid this sharp drop-off in economic activity, I take some comfort in signs of improvement in strained credit markets, particularly where policymakers have provided support.\nInterbank lending risk spreads have fallen in recent months, and residential mortgage rates have reached levels low enough to encourage refinancing and purchases by\ncreditworthy borrowers. Commercial paper spreads over short-term Treasury bills have declined, and investment-grade corporate bond spreads have remained generally flat\nfor some months. Investment-grade corporate bond issuance has been healthy of late.\nNotwithstanding some improvement, it's fair to say credit markets remain stressed.\nAll that said, I have been predicting an upturn in the overall economy beginning in the second half of 2009, with a slow and gradual return to our full economic potential. To\ntemper that outlook a bit, uncertainty remains unusually high, and one has to be mindful of very real downside risks, including a further deterioration in real estate.\nResidential real estate\nAs you know, residential real estate was the catalyst of problems in credit markets. Problems in housing contributed to economic weakness, but now the slowing economy is\nfeeding back into the continued housing slowdown. South Florida has been among the hardest-hit residential markets, so let me spend a few moments discussing housing.\nAt the current pace of sales, the nation's supply of new homes is more than 13 months—the highest on record. Sales of new single-family homes fell 10 percent in January,\nand existing homes fell more than 5 percent.\nHome prices here in Miami—after a steep run-up during the housing boom—have fallen 41 percent from a peak in December 2006. Nationally, house prices in 20 major\nMSAs have fallen almost 27 percent since their peak in the second quarter of 2006, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index.\nOther measures show smaller declines nationally. There's no doubt, though, that declining house prices have been a major driver of mortgage delinquencies, defaults, and\nforeclosures. What's happening is a profound revaluation of mortgage portfolios as well as securities in the global secondary market for mortgage-backed securities.\n\n1\n\n\fEfforts to prevent foreclosures appear to have had only modest success so far.1 There are many reasons this might be the case, but among them is the obstacle posed by\nsecuritization agreements to loan modifications. To date, payment-reducing modifications have been the exception rather than the rule. As a result, redefault rates have been\nhigh, and new foreclosures continue to add downward pressure on housing prices.\nI should also comment on the weakening multifamily residential real estate picture. No two rental markets are exactly alike. But to generalize, those markets trending the\nworst probably share one or more characteristics. They had excessive condo construction or condo conversion activity. Such markets are seeing unsold units return as\nrentals. They had very high home price appreciation in the years 2004—07 with large amounts of speculative house construction activity. Today, in several markets, houses\ncompete with apartments as rentals. And they have been experiencing high and rising foreclosure rates.2\nCommercial real estate\nWhile historically smaller than residential real estate, commercial real estate (or nonresidential structures) accounts for a not-insignificant portion of the American economy—\nat least 4 percent of GDP directly and perhaps more, depending on estimates. Also, commercial real estate is important to the financial sector. And a rejuvenated financial\nsector is essential for economic recovery.\nThere are currently some $2.5 trillion of commercial property loans on the balance sheets of financial institutions and in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)\nmarkets. In contrast, residential mortgage debt amounts to about $11 trillion.3\nSome 25 percent of commercial real estate debt is securitized, compared with 60 percent of outstanding home mortgage debt. The volume of CMBS has more than doubled\nsince 2003, a bit faster than the growth of overall commercial real estate debt.\nThere are several subsectors of commercial real estate: retail, office, hotel, and industrial. All are facing problems.\nThere is a growing imbalance of retail space for several reasons. A lot of new retail space was added in areas that saw a high level of home construction, much of which has\nnot been absorbed.\nThis imbalance is aggravated by general weakness in the retail industry. Established retail centers are seeing rising vacancy rates. When an anchor tenant leaves a shopping\ncenter, or overall occupancy falls below a threshold level, other tenants are often free to cancel their leases. Industry data indicate that abandoned retail store expansions\nand store closings have reached levels not seen since the recession and real estate slump of 1991–92.4\nThe hotel subsector is facing excess supply in the face of soft demand. Occupancy rates declined about 8 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2008, according to\nindustry sources.5 Summer tourism was hurt by high gas prices, and now business travel is declining as companies scale back in a weak economy.\nAlso, with the decline in the economy and rising unemployment, office and industrial vacancies have been rising. In virtually all segments of commercial real estate, there is\ndownward pressure on property values because of new construction coming on stream—construction started before the recession fully set in—coupled with the effects of the\neconomic downturn.\nInterestingly, the only property type currently withstanding downward pressures is warehouse. This seems to be, perversely, at least partly because of the back-up of\ninventories resulting from weak consumer spending and adverse retail and manufacturing conditions.\nFinancing pressures\nGiven eroding demand for commercial space, financing pressures in commercial real estate are cause for concern. Vacancy, property value, and financing are connected, of\ncourse.\nBanks are a primary source of construction financing for commercial properties. Various financing models have evolved. The largest construction loans on \"trophy\nproperties,\" for example, are typically syndicated among very large banks with equity provided by institutional investors. When construction is completed and the property's\noperating cash flow has stabilized, the loan is placed with an investment fund, with an institutional investor, or in the CMBS market.\nFor other large properties, banks lend for the construction of new projects or to refinance existing loans and then look to the CMBS market to provide the longer-term funding.\nFor smaller properties, many regional and community banks do not use the CMBS market on a regular basis, often keeping the mortgages on their books.\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts estimates that about $400 billion of commercial mortgages are set to mature this year, raising concern about\nmaturity defaults.\nCommercial real estate finance challenges could further complicate efforts to stabilize the banking system and credit markets. Banks that financed the construction of\ncommercial properties may end up keeping those loans if the properties cannot achieve the cash flow needed to service new permanent debt. Loans maturing face a CMBS\nmarket that virtually shut down in the latter part of 2008 and a banking industry that is already saddled with bad assets from the residential sector.\nPublic policy response\nAs a Fed policymaker, I must consider whether we have tools in place to soften the impact of emerging weaknesses.\nThe Fed has a number of tools at our disposal and has been using them aggressively.\nWith the emergence of financial turmoil, starting in the latter half of 2007, and weakening growth, the FOMC aggressively lowered the short-term policy interest rate—the\nfederal funds rate—from 5.25 percent in September 2007 to a range just above zero today. The federal funds rate is the foundation rate of the whole spectrum of private\nmarket rates of varying tenors and loan purposes. By influencing the yield curve, the fed funds rate acts to stimulate general economic activity.\nThe Fed also introduced a number of targeted credit facilities aimed at easing liquidity pressures faced by financial institutions and restoring the functioning of key capital\nmarkets. Examples include facilities for commercial paper and money market mutual funds.\n\n\fRecently, the Fed has begun directly purchasing assets in securities markets. The Fed has authorized the purchase of up $100 billion of debt of federal housing finance\nagencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and another $500 billion of agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. To date, about $195 billion has been expended\nin this program. The provision of such liquidity has served to lower yield spreads on these securities, which ultimately can translate into lower mortgage rates for consumers.\nWith continued illiquidity in securitization markets, the Federal Reserve—in cooperation with the U.S. Treasury—recently announced that it is prepared to expand its\nforthcoming Term Asset-Backed Securities Liquidity Facility (TALF) from $200 billion to up to $1 trillion. This program was originally designed to support consumer and small\nbusiness finance through lending on securities backed by small business loans, student loans, auto loans, and credit cards. An announcement yesterday also said that the\nFed and Treasury are looking into accepting CMBS and other types of AAA-rated, newly issued ABS.\nI also want to mention measures taken to stem preventable foreclosures. Here in south Florida, for example, our staff created and co-chairs a homeownership preservation\ntask force of nearly 80 organizations to promote dialogue between lenders and foreclosure counselors. Since foreclosure prevention is not always possible, we are also\nproviding data and analysis to local municipalities as they prepare to purchase, rehabilitate, and sell properties to help protect neighborhood integrity.\nNear term and long term\nIt's fair to ask: Will these efforts be effective? There are no guarantees, but I take comfort from several aspects of the public policy response. First, policymakers have acted\nforcefully to address the economic and financial sector crises.\nAs mentioned earlier, Fed interventions have had success in credit markets where we've introduced specific facilities to address acute market stress. I look forward to the day\nthese programs are no longer necessary, but they can be kept in place as conditions require.\nSecond, other public policy organizations have also acted. For instance, the U.S. Treasury Department has announced a multipronged financial stability plan, which includes\nmeasures to strengthen the capital position of banks, remove bad assets from bank balance sheets, and other actions. And the new administration has recently released its\ncomprehensive Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan that is designed to lower actual payments for many homeowners. In addition, Congress recently passed a large\neconomic stimulus package with measures intended to stop net job destruction and kick-start job creation.\nWith regard to the longer run, it will be important to take a very careful look at what went wrong during this period. Many observers have expressed doubts about the\nsecuritization process. They have pointed to incentive conflicts within the originate-to-distribute model of financial intermediation, along with concerns about the ability of\nlenders and the rating agencies to properly measure risk.\nIn my view securitization markets need reform but in the end will be a substantial part of the nation's total credit system. Securitization has provided cost benefits to\nconsumers and other borrowers and liquidity to loan originators, including commercial banks. It's essential that securitization markets get brought back to life.\nOne more thought in closing: Public policy and the resilience of our citizens are being tested. With respect to public policy, I want to assure you that the Fed has the capacity\nto act, even with the federal funds rate near zero, with the aim of returning the country as quickly as possible to its enormous potential for growth and prosperity.\n\nFootnotes\n1.

        "content": "SPEECHES\n\nThoughts on Risk in the Current Economic Situation\nDennis P. Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAssociation for Financial Professionals Corporate Risk Forum\nOrlando, Florida\nFebruary 23, 2009\nThanks for inviting me. It's a privilege to be your luncheon speaker for the Association for Financial Professionals Corporate Risk Forum.\nI approached this speech by thinking about what I could offer an audience of risk management professionals from diverse industries in these times\nof risk being all too real. Your businesses and clients share at some level a common macro environment even if the implications of macro risk might\nplay differently from industry to industry and company to company. Today I want to discuss the state of the economy and the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Atlanta's forecast, or outlook, for the economy this year. That sort of speech is pretty standard for a Reserve Bank president. To make the\n\"relevance connection\" to your field of risk management, you may take my remarks on the macroeconomy as one policymaker's views on the\ncontext in which you evaluate the risks specific to your company's or client's situation.\nRecently the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) enhanced the transparency of our policy deliberations by disclosing the central tendency of\nformal quarterly forecasts of each Reserve Bank. I will also provide my perspective on the macroeconomic forecasting process employed by the\nAtlanta Fed and comment on how you might consider the usefulness of such forecast information in your evaluation of macro risk.\nI must state up front that these remarks are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC.\nThe state of the economy\nA little more than a year ago, the economy entered into a recession. If the consensus economic forecast is accurate, we are likely to still be in recession through at least the\nfirst half of this year. Since the end of World War II, the United States has experienced 10 other recessions. On average, they have lasted 10 months. So the current\ndownturn is already longer than usual.\nI know that as risk management practitioners, you track the economy at whatever aggregation—regional, national, global—is most relevant to your business. Let me highlight\nfor you some of the national economic indicators I'm following as a monetary policymaker.\nFirst, there's housing—the source of much of the current economic weakness. New residential construction has fallen by more than half in the past 20 months, taking about\none full percentage point off annual GDP growth.\nTroubles with housing have taken a heavy toll on consumer spending. Purchases of big-ticket items that require a large financial commitment and access to credit—notably\nautos—have been especially curtailed.\nAlso, business spending has fallen sharply. Investment spending has been deferred and cost control intensified.\nLabor markets have been shedding jobs rapidly in manufacturing and services. During the past 12 months our economy has lost a net of 3.5 million jobs, with about half of\nthose job losses in the past three months.\nIf there has been a silver lining in the economic slowdown, it's prices. Inflation in recent months has declined to the point where consumer prices in January 2009 were\nunchanged from a year earlier—the lowest rate of change since August 1955.\nThe outlook\nIt's obvious to all that the current state of the economy is extremely weak. The more pertinent question is, what does the future hold?\nThe economic forecast I submitted for the most recent FOMC meeting at the end of January reflected my view that the economy faces obstacles likely to work against a\nstrong rebound of growth over the next several quarters. Those obstacles include credit markets not yet returned to healthy functioning, a housing market still weighed down\nby an excess supply of homes for sale, and low business and household confidence. None of these is likely to turn around quickly.\nBut as discouraging as these indicators are for the very immediate future, most forecasts, my own included, see catalysts for the start of modest recovery in the second half\nof the year.\nWith production falling—and expected to decline significantly more this quarter—I expect some reduction of excess inventories, putting producers in a position to expand\noutput as spending returns.\nThere are signs lower mortgage interest rates are helping housing markets on the margin. The January pending sales number was up, and there has been a spurt in\nrefinancing activity. If historically low mortgage rates can be sustained over the coming months, I expect more buyers will be drawn into the market.\nSeveral factors should lift consumer spending as the year progresses. These factors include the dramatic fall in energy prices, greater stability in the housing market, and\nimproving consumer confidence. Also, as you know, the tax cuts in the recent stimulus package were designed to generate an immediate boost to consumer spending.\n\n\fForecasts as an exercise in risk management\nThe premise of that baseline forecast is founded, as you would expect, on assumptions that may or may not materialize. My forecast of resumption of modest growth in the\nsecond half assumes, to repeat, some stabilization of house prices, some normalization of credit markets' functioning, some benefit from the stimulus package, and some\nimprovement of business and consumer confidence evidenced by greater investment spending and personal consumption. A Reserve Bank's official forecast also has as its\npremise \"appropriate monetary policy.\" That is to say, whatever scenario we adopt as our baseline forecast is not independent of policy, but rather vitally entwined with Fed\npolicy as a significant influence on outcomes.\nThis aspect of our forecasting is a little different than macro environmental assumptions relevant to individual enterprises. Companies can establish assumptions for the\nexternal environment and then derive implications for the business and strategies to respond to external reality. Public policy bodies like the Fed have meaningful influence\non the macro environment to varying degrees over time.\nPolicy is a major factor in our forecasts and not a reaction to a forecast. To convey a sense of what \"appropriate monetary policy\" might mean for the near term, I would point\nto the statement that followed the January 28 FOMC meeting. The committee stated that \"economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal\nfunds rate for some time.\" The committee further advised that all available tools will be employed to get back to economic growth, which means, in my interpretation, further\ncredit programs such as the purchase of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities or expansion of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which was\nrecently announced as part of the Treasury's Financial Stability Plan.\nI should also explain that my baseline forecast is a scenario around which we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta carry out a process of \"dynamic monitoring.\" The\nstream of incoming data is analyzed for implications for the assumptions underlying our forecast, which in turn is revised as required by the unfolding of reality—weekly,\nmonthly, and quarterly.\nEconomic forecasts—particularly when looked at collectively—provide valuable information for risk managers in their underlying assumptions and their information about the\ndegree of uncertainty in the economic environment. I would argue they are less useful as point predictions of data elements or timing of turning points.\nAmong the lessons I've taken from my two years of experience as a central banker is how difficult it is to see the transition to a nonlinear future, which you might think of as\nthe change from one phase of the business cycle to another. Forces that produce the beginnings and ends of recessions are particularly difficult to predict. Turning points are\nanomalous events and by their very nature are more difficult to see than variations around a more or less linear scenario, by which I mean continuity from past to present.\nAs a consequence, economic forecasts will tend to be overly optimistic as the economy goes into a recession but overly pessimistic as the economy comes out of recession\nand begins its expansion. Perhaps we should take some comfort in that observation today.\nI think there are some other lessons to take away from the experience of the last two years. Tail risks—low probability but extremely consequential events—do sometimes\nmaterialize. Ignoring tail risks—\"black swans,\" in the words of author Nassim Taleb—may be irresponsible. Because forecasting is an inexact exercise, because shocks by\nnature aren't anticipated, and because both theoretical models and econometric models cannot incorporate actual complexity, policy must sometimes take what we call a\n\"risk management\" approach. Policymakers occasionally need to take out insurance against economic tail risks, and this approach is especially relevant when traditional\nrelationships have broken down. Case in point: Our models are based on a history where financial markets are working.\nComprehensive policy response\nLet me give you my appraisal of current policy.\nResponding to the scope and severity of our economic ills, policymakers have taken and will soon implement unprecedented measures to restore financial stability and\neconomic growth. In my view, the diagnosis is substantially correct, and the actions targeted on discrete aspects of the overall problem, taken together, constitute an\nappropriately comprehensive approach. Let me bring focus to five dimensions of the current problem and connect them to the associated policy actions.\nFirst, there is credit market dysfunction. The Fed has attacked this problem by introducing a number of credit market liquidity programs. For example, the TALF supports new\nlending in credit cards, student loans, auto loans, and small businesses. This program could provide up to $1 trillion and should help repair securitization markets and boost\ncredit to broad categories of consumers and small and midsized businesses.\nJump-starting securitization markets is vitally important. Securitization markets are and will be a substantial part of the nation's total credit system.\nAnother problem is banking system weakness. I believe that by injecting capital into banks, the U.S. Treasury has strengthened and will further strengthen bank balance\nsheets. Under Treasury's new plan, the government also will create a mechanism to remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets, which should help rehabilitate the\nbanking system, a basic prerequisite of recovery.\nA third dimension of today's weakness is falling house prices. The FOMC has stated that the Fed will continue to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities to support mortgage and housing markets, and the Fed stands ready to expand the quantity and duration of such purchases. Also, a foreclosure prevention\nprogram is included in the Treasury's new plan. If successful, a source of pressure on home prices should be reduced.\nThe Administration's economic stimulus package is designed to address the recent surge of unemployment, which is a fourth aspect of economic weakness. Rapid\ndownstreaming of funding to state and local governments should help forestall further layoffs and furloughing of public sector employees. Public works and other investment\nprojects should put some of the unemployed back to work, depending on the speed of mobilization.\nFinally, there is the broad-based economic weakness that has enveloped almost all industry sectors with a deficit of confidence as both cause and effect. We are in a period\nof unconventional policy measures, and that situation is especially true of the Federal Reserve. But the stimulative power of conventional monetary policy in the form of a\nfederal funds rate at its lowest possible level should not be forgotten. As I said earlier, the FOMC has stated that low interest rate policy is likely to continue for some time.\nI believe these actions—taken as a whole—are a forceful and coherent response to the problems at hand. In judging coherence, I apply these criteria:\nIs the problem correctly diagnosed?\nIs the response to each dimension of the problem sufficiently sized?\n\n\fIs the response timely?\nAnd, is the specific policy reversible when required or appropriate?\nThere is policy risk, to be sure, by which I mean risk that the policy medicine won't work, won't be enough, or will come too late. But if forecasts of improvement don't\nmaterialize, as I said earlier, the Fed is not without capacity to act, even with the fed funds rate at its lower bound.\nOther risks\nA sober mindset dictates that I, as a policymaker, watch for indications of both recovery and further deterioration. Beyond policy risk, the banking system, and housing, there\nare other downside risks that bear watching, in my view.\nFirst, there's the commercial real estate sector. Vacancy rates are rising, and in 2009 a considerable amount of debt comes due and must be refinanced.\nSecond, I'm following the state and municipal fiscal situation. Revenues have fallen sharply and debt financing is constrained. Even with the stimulus money, some\ngovernment entities may continue to face serious fiscal problems.\nInternationally, I'm watching the external debt position of emerging markets and the effect of sovereign debt exposure on overseas banks, particularly in Europe.\nI'm also paying close attention to the trajectory of Japan. Last quarter the Japanese economy contracted by 13 percent, and deflationary pressures have accelerated.\nFinally, I'm concerned about growing global protectionist sentiment. The Great Depression taught that beggar-thy-neighbor policies can do immense harm.\nComprehensive, scaled, and coherent responses\nIn my view, we have reached a pivotal juncture.\nAfter a rapid onset of problems in the economy and financial system—both global and national—we've reached a point where incremental responses must proceed to\nsomething more comprehensive, scaled, and coherent.\nI believe the composite policy approach is correct in focus and intent, and now the devil is largely in the details and implementation. I am confident policymakers across the\nvarious relevant arms of government understand the importance of moving ahead as quickly as possible to provide detailed rules of the road and achieve clarity.\nAs these policy actions take effect and work in concert, I believe the economy and financial sector will respond positively. Thank you.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\nRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Speaker's Bureau\n\n\f"

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nBirmingham Regional Chamber of Commerce\nBirmingham, Alabama\nFebruary 19, 2009\nThanks for inviting me. It's a privilege to be your afternoon speaker for the Birmingham Regional Chamber of Commerce's 2009 Business Outlook\nConference.\nEarlier today, you heard about the local economy and some industries important in this region. This afternoon, I'd like to speak more broadly about\nthe U.S. economic situation and outlook. I know that times are rough right now, but I believe policies in place and about to be implemented will work\nto restore financial stability and economic growth for the long term. During my remarks, I will describe some of the signposts I'm looking for on the\nroad to economic recovery.\nI want to state up front that these remarks are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\nThe state of the economy\nA little more than a year ago, the economy entered into a recession. By all available indicators, we remain in recession today. And if the consensus economic forecast is\naccurate, we are likely to still be in recession through at least the first half of this year.\nSince the end of World War II, we've experienced 10 other recessions. On average, they have lasted 10 months. So the current downturn is already longer than usual.\nLast fall, the pace of business and consumer spending dropped off sharply and the labor market started shedding jobs at a much faster pace than what we had seen over the\nfirst three quarters of the year. So at a time when historical experience suggests the economy should have begun to crawl out of the downturn, the recession instead began\nto pick up momentum.\nLet me describe to you in somewhat broad terms the buildup to today and the current economic picture.\nThe problems originated in the housing market and spread to other sectors as mortgage-related losses damaged bank (and other financial institutions') balance sheets.\nCounterparty risk aversion first brought liquidity pressures. After a stream of writeoffs, these liquidity pressures progressed to doubts about solvency.\nAn array of key financial markets—particularly securitization markets—became illiquid. Access to credit through security markets or banks tightened severely. Business and\nconsumer confidence was shaken.\nAs you know, housing has been particularly hard hit. Existing sales have fallen about 35 percent from peak levels in September 2005, and the inventory of unsold homes has\nsoared and remained at high levels. As a consequence, home prices have fallen 20 to 25 percent nationally—even more in certain areas.\nThe direct impact of housing on the economy has been substantial. New residential construction has fallen by more than half in the past 20 months, taking about one full\npercentage point off annual GDP growth. Housing starts today stand below 500,000 annualized. Business models and capacity in the home building and building materials\nindustries were designed for starts at a rate approaching two million.\nYet while housing may have triggered the recession, the downturn—particularly since last September—has gone well beyond residential construction.\nConsumers have sharply pulled back spending. Declining home and equity values, worsening income prospects because of a deteriorating labor market, and a general\nunease about the economy have strained finances in many households.\nPurchases of big-ticket items that require a large financial commitment and access to credit—notably autos—have been especially curtailed. But virtually every component of\nconsumer spending has dropped in dollar value by deferral, substitution, or outright elimination from household expenditures.\nLed by a decline in motor vehicle and parts production, manufacturing output fell by 2.5 percent in January—the third consecutive steep monthly decline.\nAt the end of last year, exports and business investment spending became the latest casualties of this cycle of wealth and income destruction. As business conditions around\nthe world began to worsen, previously robust export markets dried up. Last quarter, U.S. real exports fell for the first time in five and a half years.\nAt the same time, the uncertain sales outlook and credit difficulties pushed capital spending sharply lower—down a bit more than 19 percent at an annual rate in the fourth\nquarter—its biggest quarterly retreat in 34 years.\nThe cascading drop in business activity I just described has taken a toll on the U.S. labor market. During the past 12 months our economy has lost a net of 3.5 million jobs,\nwith about half of those losses in the past three months. Even the recession-resilient services sector has lost more than 1.7 million jobs since December 2007.\nThe rate of joblessness has jumped a full percentage point since October to 7.6 percent. The share of unemployment attributable to layoffs, the share of people who are\nworking part-time because of a weak economy, and the proportion of people who have dropped out of the labor force in discouragement have all risen sharply in the past few\n\n\fmonths.\nThe outlook\nIt's obvious to all that the current state of the economy is extremely weak.\nThe national economic indicators I have described are evidenced daily in your order books, human resource reports, and income statements. I suspect there is little in these\nnumbers that you don't already know from your direct experience. What is likely \"top of mind\" for most of you, I am sure, is the question \"When does this dreary story end?\"\nThe economic forecast I submitted for the most recent FOMC meeting reflected my view that the economy faces obstacles that are likely to work against a strong rebound of\ngrowth over the next several quarters. Those obstacles include credit markets not yet returned to healthy functioning, a housing market still weighed down by an excess\nsupply of homes for sale, and low business and household confidence. None of these is likely to turn around quickly.\nBut as discouraging as these indicators are for the very immediate future, the economic outlook is not indefinitely bad. Most forecasts, my own included, see catalysts for the\nstart of modest recovery in the second half of the year.\nWith production falling—and expected to decline significantly more this quarter—I expect some reduction of excess business inventories, putting producers in a position to\nexpand output as spending returns.\nThere are signs lower mortgage interest rates are helping housing markets on the margin. The January pending sales number was up, and there has been a spurt in\nrefinancing activity. If historically low mortgage rates can be sustained over the coming months, I expect more buyers will be drawn into the market.\nSeveral factors should lift consumer spending as the year progresses. These factors include the dramatic fall in energy prices, greater stability in the housing market, and\nimproving consumer confidence.\nI should mention that last week the U.S. Census Bureau reported an unexpected increase in retail sales during January. I would like to see further confirmation of the\nunderlying strength hinted at in this report, but on its face, the pickup in consumer spending is encouraging.\nAlso contributing to the upturn seen in the consensus outlook are the large and targeted fiscal, credit, and monetary policies of the government and the Federal Reserve—a\ntopic I will return to in a moment. The intent of these aggressive and unprecedented policy actions is to support spending and fix the dysfunction in credit markets that has so\nseverely constrained the economy's natural forces of growth.\nIndeed, we have seen modest, but hopeful, signs that financial markets are improving. A key element in the improved economic environment expected in the latter half of the\nyear is that financial institutions will find more stable footing and begin to provide greater support to business expansion and consumer spending.\nComprehensive policy response\nAn important consideration in the outlook is the policy effect. Responding to the scope and severity of our economic ills, policymakers have taken and will soon implement\nunprecedented measures to restore financial stability and economic growth. In my view, the diagnosis is substantially correct and the actions targeted on discrete aspects of\nthe overall problem constitute an appropriately comprehensive approach. Let me bring focus to five aspects of the current problem and connect them to the associated policy\nactions.\nFirst, there's credit market dysfunction. The Fed has attacked this problem by introducing a number of credit market liquidity programs. For example, the Term Asset-Backed\nSecurities Loan Facility (TALF) supports new lending in credit cards, student loans, auto loans, and small businesses. This program could provide up to $1 trillion and should\nhelp repair securitization markets and boost credit to broad categories of consumers and small and mid-sized businesses.\nJump-starting securitization markets is vitally important. Securitization markets are and will be a substantial part of the nation's total credit system.\nAnother problem is banking system weakness. By injecting capital into banks, I believe the U.S. Treasury has strengthened and will further strengthen bank balance sheets.\nUnder Treasury's new plan, the government also will create a mechanism to in effect remove troubled assets from bank balance sheets, which should help rehabilitate the\nbanking system, a sine qua non of recovery.\nA third dimension of today's weakness is falling house prices. The FOMC has stated that the Fed will continue to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities to support mortgage and housing markets, and the Fed stands ready to expand the quantity and duration of such purchases. Also, a foreclosure prevention\nprogram is included in the Treasury's new plan. If successful, a source of pressure on home prices should be reduced.\nThe Administration's economic stimulus package is designed to address the recent surge of unemployment, which is a fourth aspect of economic weakness. Rapid\ndownstreaming of funding to state and local governments should help forestall further layoffs and furloughing of public sector employees.

But the stimulative power of conventional monetary policy in the form of a federal funds\nrate at its lowest possible level should not be forgotten. The FOMC has stated that low interest rate policy is likely to continue for some time.\nI believe these actions—taken as a whole—are not only strategic as argued above but also a coherent response to the problems at hand. In judging coherence, I apply these\ncriteria:\nIs the problem correctly diagnosed?\nIs the response to each dimension of the problem sufficiently sized?\nIs the response timely?\nAnd, is the specific policy reversible when required or appropriate?\n\n\fThere is policy risk, to be sure, by which I mean risk that the policy medicine won't work, won't be enough, or will come too late. But if forecasts of improvement don't\nmaterialize, the Fed is not without capacity to act, even with the fed funds rate at its lower bound.\nA sober mindset dictates that I, as a policymaker, watch for signposts of both recovery and further deterioration. On my watchlist through 2009 is the commercial real estate\nsector. For instance, I am following the risk of defaults related to refinancing demands of existing properties and project development loans coming up for long-term financing.\nI also will be watching the financial conditions of emerging markets as well as growing protectionist sentiment in this country.\nSignposts on the road to recovery\nAs I look ahead, signposts on the road to recovery include sustained normalization in credit markets and stabilization of house prices. Also, I'm watching for an uptick in\nbusiness spending to give a sign of a return of opportunity seeking and private sector risk taking needed to sustain growth.\nI draw hope that the signposts will be biased to the upside from my conversations with businesspeople like yourselves. Increasingly, I'm hearing that this current set of\ncircumstances presents very interesting opportunities for individual businesses. When stronger companies act on those opportunities, an important element of recovery will\nbegin.\nWe have reached a pivotal juncture. After a rapid onset of problems in the economy and financial system—both global and national—we've reached a point where\nincremental responses must proceed to something more comprehensive, scaled, and coherent.\nI believe the composite policy approach is correct in focus and intent, and now the devil is largely in the details and implementation. I am confident policymakers across the\nvarious relevant arms of government understand the importance of moving ahead as quickly as possible to provide detailed rules of the road.\nAs these policy actions take effect and work in concert, I'm confident the economy and financial sector will respond positively.

Lockhart\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRotary Club of Atlanta\nAtlanta, Georgia\nJanuary 12, 2009\nWithout question, last year was extraordinary. Developments included the failure of storied investment banks and the introduction of an arsenal of economic policy tools and\nresponses.\nEntering 2009—having been back in the South now for almost two years—I added one more tool to a list that includes rate cuts, special liquidity\nfacilities, rescue funds, deposit guarantees, and interventions to save institutions whose failure would pose risk to the global system. Following an\nold tradition, I had a plate of black-eyed peas on New Year's Day for good luck. I figured, \"Well, it can't hurt.\"\nAs a policymaker on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I want to organize my thinking by revisiting basic questions. I will structure my\nremarks today around two such questions. They are, first, what is Fed policy trying to accomplish in these extraordinary times? Second, how is the\nFed going about accomplishing those policy objectives?\nThe context here really matters. The principal instrument by which the Fed influences the economy is the federal funds rate (the overnight rate at\nwhich banks lend and borrow central bank reserves). The fed funds rate can't go any lower. As you know, at the FOMC meeting December 16, the\nfederal funds rate target was lowered to a range of 0–25 basis points. A year ago, when I last spoke to you, the fed funds rate target was at 425\nbasis points (or 4.25 percent).\nIn terms economists use, the policy rate has reached its zero lower bound. This situation has raised concerns that the Fed can't do any more to combat recession and that\nmonetary policy—broadly defined—has lost relevance at a crucial point in time. I would argue that a federal funds rate this low will have considerable macroeconomic effect\nespecially if accompanied by policies to improve the functioning of credit markets.\nTraditionally, these January talks by the Atlanta Fed president at the Atlanta Rotary have concentrated on the economic outlook. I will talk a bit today about the outlook, but I\nplan to depart somewhat from tradition to explain the new monetary policy regime that I expect will be employed for the foreseeable future—while the fed funds rate can't go\nany lower. My intent is to assure you the Federal Reserve has not exhausted its policy tools. The policy arsenal available to the Federal Reserve remains a powerful\ncorrective force on the economy.\nAs usual, I offer the disclaimer that all my remarks are my personal views and don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC.\nThe state of the economy\nI'll begin with some economic highlights of the year we have just put behind us. We now know that the U.S. economy was in a recession that began in December 2007, and\nthis recession could end up as one of the longest since World War II.\nFriday's employment report reinforced both the depth and breadth of the downturn. Nonfarm payrolls tumbled an estimated 524,000 in December as the unemployment rate\nhit 7.2 percent—a 16-year high. The economy lost around 2.6 million jobs for the year. Moreover, the job losses are very broad-based across industries, with only\ngovernment, private education, and healthcare adding jobs in December.\nThe depth of the downturn is reflected in the dramatic decline in consumer spending in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, led by a collapse of auto sales. Motor vehicle\nsales were some 36 percent below year-earlier levels in December.\nJust a few months ago, inflation was at very high levels following a steep run-up in commodity and fuel costs. However, commodity prices, most notably oil prices, have fallen\nsharply in recent months, evidencing a marked pullback in global growth. This, combined with a fall-off of broad domestic activity, has led to a substantial slowing of inflation.\nAs much as anything, we'll probably remember 2008 for extreme volatility and dysfunction in financial markets, particularly credit capital markets serving businesses and\nhouseholds. Volumes of credit flows fell off dramatically, risk spreads widened, and some markets virtually shut down. We've seen improvement since the worst period in\nSeptember and October, but, all in all, financial conditions going into 2009 are still unsettled.\nToday, as we move into 2009, economic conditions are extremely weak and financial markets remain impaired. In the banking sector, a posture of risk aversion—or at least\ncaution—persists.\nWhat's the Fed trying to accomplish?\nKeeping these circumstances in mind, let me address the first question I posed at the outset. That is, what's the Fed trying to accomplish?\nIn simple terms, we're focused on containing the impact of the economic downturn and stimulating a recovery as early as possible. The Fed is not alone in this effort. The\nTreasury Department and other federal agencies have also implemented policies to support economic growth, and the incoming administration has proposed a large fiscal\nstimulus package for the economy.\nThe Fed, as the country's central bank, conducts monetary policy—as distinct from fiscal policy—under legal mandates set down by Congress. The Fed's mandated policy\nobjectives—the so-called dual mandate—are sustainable economic growth along with low and stable inflation.\n\n\fThe mandates have not changed. But what has changed is some aspects of how we pursue those objectives. Extraordinary circumstances this last year and a half have\nrequired the Fed to expand the set of tools employed to meet those objectives.\nNew monetary policy\nModern conventional monetary policy is usually thought of as the Fed's adjustment of the federal funds rate target in the overnight market for bank reserves. Bank reserves\nare a liability on the central bank's balance sheet. The fed funds rate is important because it influences the whole term structure of interest rates. The lowering of the funds\nrate target some 525 basis points since September 2007 can be seen as a direct response to worsening economic conditions and the resulting downward revisions to the\noutlook.\nThe federal funds rate is a very general tool and one that relies on the functioning of credit markets to have its intended effects. But, as you know, credit markets have not\nbeen functioning normally even in markets strongly backed by the U.S. government, such as agency (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) mortgage-backed securities. In\nturn, mortgage markets and housing demand have suffered.\nProblems that began in the subprime mortgage-backed securities market spread rapidly and often ferociously among interconnected markets and institutions. It's not too\nmuch an exaggeration to say no one and no market remained untouched. In response to events, the Fed had to be creative.\nInitially, as the Fed responded to credit market strains, the focus was on interbank markets. But, as problems spread, the Fed introduced almost a dozen targeted credit and\nfinancial market facilities. The facilities now include short-term credit programs for financial institutions, longer-term lending arrangements, direct asset purchases, and swap\nlines with foreign central banks. The Fed has intervened, for example, in the commercial paper market, the agency market, and the private asset-backed securities market.\nPrograms have supported banks, nonbank financial institutions, money market mutual funds, and, as you know, specific institutions deemed to be systemically critical.\nAmong the programs in force is the direct purchase of agency (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) notes and mortgage-backed securities. These securities are directly linked to\nmortgage rates. Purchases began just a few days ago. The goal of such a program is not, in my view, to engineer a particular interest rate level, that is, to hit a particular rate\ntarget. But direct purchases can promote directionally lower rates, help restore normal market functioning, and thereby achieve a return to reliance on private sector marketbased credit allocation.\nThe introduction of targeted asset-side measures has been aimed squarely at the breakdown of credit markets, the circulatory system of our modern economy. In my view, a\nprecondition of economic recovery is the return of the normal functioning of credit markets.\nLet me emphasize that this asset-focused approach is a departure from what the textbooks describe as conventional monetary policy and is not without controversy. Some\nhave called it credit policy to distinguish it from the conventional approach where the central bank achieves its objectives through its influence on bank reserves on the\nliability side of the balance sheet.\nI don't often use slides in speeches, but I want to show you this image because it so clearly illustrates this new approach and, I believe, helps to answer the second question I\nposed at the outset. And that is, how will the Fed go about accomplishing the policy objectives I described earlier by using the asset side of its balance sheet?\nAs the graph shows, there are two aspects of this policy approach—growth of the Fed's balance sheet in absolute terms and change of the composition of assets. Even with\nthe federal funds rate effectively at zero, there is ample scope to do more of both if conditions require.\nMeasuring policy actions\nIs it working? Well, isolating the effects unique to the Fed's policy actions on these various markets is difficult. Nonetheless, financial market functioning has shown some\nsigns of improving in recent weeks.\nBy way of example, in the short-term interbank funding markets, which are of central importance, spreads have declined markedly across maturities.\nConditions in commercial paper markets also have improved. Commercial paper issuance has increased from recent lows, and spreads on 30-day, asset-backed commercial\npaper, for instance, have narrowed.\nIn addition, mortgage rates have fallen recently in response to the Fed's announcement that it will purchase large quantities of mortgage-backed securities and agency debt.\nFreddie Mac's most recent mortgage market survey showed the average 30-year fixed rate has declined to just over 5 percent—the lowest since the series began in 1972.\nIt's impossible to measure what economists call a counterfactual—what might otherwise have happened. But without a willingness to use all available tools and to adapt\npolicy tools as conditions required, I'm convinced the economy's performance and current outlook would have been considerably worse.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead, the overall economy is very weak, and I expect it will remain weak at least through the first half of 2009. The incoming data suggest fourth quarter GDP\ncontracted somewhere between 4 and 6 percent (annualized). And this quarter's performance could be similar. At some point—perhaps later this year—I believe financial\nmarkets will have stabilized sufficiently to support a recovery. So I am looking for an improving economy in the second half. To temper that a bit, there is always the risk of a\nshock or reversal in the financial sector or elsewhere that could again alter the outlook to the downside.\nClearly, the U.S. economy is in a tough fight against pernicious economic forces. But, on balance, confidence is warranted. Indeed, restored confidence is an essential\ningredient in the mix of factors that will change the momentum of the economy. To buttress confidence, I want to assure you the Federal Reserve still has considerable\nammunition in reserve to be used as needed.\nBy this time next year, I'm hopeful circumstances will look very much better than they do today. I must admit that I don't really like black-eyed peas, so I'm hoping I can take a\npass on that dish next New Year's Day.\n\nContact: Jean Tate 404-498-8035\n\n\fRELATED LINKS: Play Speech MP3 • Play Question & Answer Session MP3 • Dennis Lockhart's biography • Federal Reserve assets illustration • Press release •\nSpeaker's Bureau\nRELATED LINKS ON OTHER SITES: Dec. 16, 2008 FOMC Meeting Statement • Factors Affecting Reserve Balances\n\n\f"
