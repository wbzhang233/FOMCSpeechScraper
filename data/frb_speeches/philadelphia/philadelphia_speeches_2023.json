Moses Dis�nguished Lecture in Transporta�on\nNorthwestern University Transporta�on Center\nNorthwestern University\nEvanston, Illinois\nNovember 8, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Oﬃcer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood evening, everyone.\nTo everyone here at the Northwestern University Transporta�on Center, it is indeed an honor to have\nbeen asked to present this year’s Leon N. Moses Dis�nguished Lecture.\nNow, if I may, here is how I intend to proceed tonight. I will begin by answering what could be a central\nques�on to the evening: “Why does a president of a Federal Reserve Bank care about transporta�on?”\nFrom there, I will share a broad outline of some of the research being conducted by the staﬀ at the\nPhiladelphia Fed, which, I believe, can be put into ac�on to help us achieve a stronger economic and\nmore reliable transporta�on future.\nI will conclude by providing my economic outlook. A�er all, I’ll note that the Moses Lectures in 2011 and\n2017 both centered on U.S. economic outlooks, so why break unnecessarily from this apparent six-year\ncycle? Also, I am acutely aware of the impact that interest rates and monetary policy can have on\ninfrastructure investments.\nAnd if �me allows, I would be happy to engage in a discussion and answer any ques�ons to add further\nclarity to our proceedings.\n1\n\n\fBut ﬁrst, my day job requires me to make one thing very clear. And that is the usual Federal Reserve\ndisclaimer. So, please note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reﬂect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr as folks back home in the Philadelphia region know, when talking about this evening, please say, “Pat\nsaid,” not “The Fed said.”\nNow, with all that business out of the way, let’s dive in.\nI should start by recognizing that I ﬁnd myself in very like-minded company. My predominant area of\nstudy, a�er all, wasn’t economics. It was civil engineering. Economics was that side project that later\nbecame my full-�me job. But my way of looking at things — even in economics — is very much with that\nsame lens I ground in my engineering days.\nNow, let me take this a step further. As an economist, and especially as president and CEO of the\nPhiladelphia Fed, my goal is to ensure a stable economy that provides opportuni�es for everyone to\ngrow and succeed. As an engineer, and speciﬁcally as a civil engineer, my goal is to ensure a safe,\nreliable, and stable infrastructure, which provides opportuni�es for all communi�es to grow and\nsucceed.\nI know I am far from the ﬁrst person to recognize this important interdisciplinary rela�onship. I can just\nlook around this room to know there are many others who do as well. And ﬁ�ngly enough, all the way\nback in 1917, John Hayford, then director of the College of Engineering here at Northwestern University,\nwrote an essay in the Journal of Poli ical Economy �tled “The Rela�on of Engineering to Economics,”\nfrom which I will read the following:\nEconomics and engineering are closely related. Economics has been deﬁned as the\nsocial science of earning a living. With the same appropriateness, engineering may be\ndeﬁned to be physical science applied to helping groups … to make a beter living. 1\n\nSee John F. Hayford, “The Rela�on of Engineering to Economics,” Journal of Political Economy, 25:1, available at\nuchicago.edu.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fThose words ring just as true 106 years later.\nBut in my current capacity, I can look to the Federal Reserve’s own dual mandate, the two pillars of our\nins�tu�onal mission that Congress handed to us in the late 1970s: price stability and maximum\nemployment. And neither, I could argue, are achievable without some level of modern transporta�on\ninfrastructure, and more speciﬁcally, engineering for modern transporta�on infrastructure.\nThe ability of goods and services to ﬂow to and from markets helps ensure that prices can remain stable.\nAnd we cannot achieve maximum employment unless employers have accessible places in which to site\ntheir businesses and workers have a way to get to and from those places of employment.\nNow, certainly, the Federal Reserve does not build transport infrastructure. But the monetary policy\ndecisions we make and implement have a direct impact on the ability of those actors responsible for\nsuch ac�ons to undertake them. I will return to this thought later in my economic outlook.\nBut with this overall intellectual background, where do we ﬁnd ourselves at this moment? By any\nmeasure, we are at a cri�cal �me not just in our economy, but for our infrastructure. We are now\nroughly 70 years removed from our na�on’s last, great infrastructure boom, including the construc�on of\nthe Interstate Highway System. And as with most things, �me isn’t always kind. The condi�ons of our\ninfrastructure call out for broad investment, and the condi�ons of our economy require us to look anew\nat what infrastructure means to our overall health, both literally and ﬁgura�vely.\nWithout a doubt, the United States would not be the preeminent global economy if not for our\ninfrastructure. We are a vast na�on, and our roads, bridges, tunnels, rails, and airports are very much the\n�es that bind the union together. But in what condi�on do we currently ﬁnd these �es?\nFor the past almost 70 years, we have been in a mode to maintain the infrastructure we currently have.\nWe became very good at ﬁxing things, and, let’s face it, we s�ll are. Case in point: When a sec�on of\nInterstate 95 in Northeast Philadelphia collapsed this summer — prac�cally paralyzing the East Coast’s\nmost essen�al transit corridor — it only took a mater of days for an ingenious repair plan to be put into\nplace and the road reopened. But in some ways, this is the excep�on to the usual cycle of infrastructure\n3\n\n\frepair, as it took cu�ng through red tape and a quicker-than-usual accoun�ng of the economic ac�vity\nbeing lost for oﬃcials to spring into ac�on at such speed.\nTransporta�on infrastructure, as we all know, is expensive to undertake and o�en slow to accomplish.\nBut the I-95 collapse and rebuild could also become a pivot point for the way we look at infrastructure. I\ncould argue that the way many have tradi�onally looked at infrastructure is much akin to the old Oscar\nWilde line about those who “[know] the price of everything and the value of nothing.” We’ve become\nvery good at knowing how much a project will cost, but we haven’t been as good at explaining the value\nof a project — the long-range economic and quality of life beneﬁts inherent in it. And so, I would say this\nis not just a �me for us to get beter at ﬁxing, but a �me for us to take a fuller stock of the results of what\nwe built in the ﬁrst place and the long-term implica�ons of what we may build in the future.\nI-95 in Philadelphia in itself is a good example for us to examine both of these thoughts. And, at the\nPhiladelphia Fed, it’s also perfectly located for us to do just that.\nIf you travel on I-95 through Philadelphia, it stands out in several ways. The ﬁrst is more sensory and\ntac�le: I-95 severed the residents of Philadelphia from the Delaware River waterfront. In the 1950s, the\nriverfront was overwhelmingly industrial, and the residen�al areas located on it were older, so litle\nthought was likely given to the construc�on of an elevated highway with beter water views than the\nnewer buildings and houses to its west.\nBut I-95 was also constructed in an age when suburban living became the new model of the American\nDream, and when highways could speed families out of city centers and into new single-family home\ndevelopments, complete with yards and driveways, in neighboring coun�es. And when a highway was\nbuilt, the noise and air pollu�on from that many cars and trucks helped push those who could aﬀord it\ntoward those new suburban developments.\n\n4\n\n\fLast year, two of my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed, Vice President and Economist Jeﬀrey Lin and\nEconomic Advisor and Economist Jeﬀrey Brinkman, took a closer look at I-95, its impact in depopula�ng\nPhiladelphia, and the poten�al beneﬁts of capping the highway. 2\nAnd Lin, I should note, is a Wildcat, having completed his undergraduate studies in economics and\nmathema�cal methods in the social sciences here at Northwestern, and studied under Dr. Leon Moses.\nSo, my colleagues started by looking at the popula�on eﬀects of freeways on central city neighborhoods,\nand what they found, if not startling, is s�ll stark. The standard narra�ve is that freeways provide access\nto opportuni�es. And this was true in the suburbs — freeways atracted development and popula�on.\nBut this was decidedly not the case in central ci�es. Lin and Brinkman found, in central ci�es, a\npopula�on decline of nearly one-third in the census tracts closest to freeways, while the popula�ons in\nthe tracts more than two miles from the nearest freeway increased by more than 50 percent. And the\ndecline in those neighborhoods closer to a freeway makes sense, not just because of noise and pollu�on,\nbut because of the nega�ve barrier eﬀects to local ameni�es — the dead-ending of streets that\npreviously provided through access to jobs or shopping, making previously straight-forward trips longer\nfor residents.\nLin and Brinkman also calculated the value of neighborhood ameni�es in areas of Philadelphia closest to\nfreeways to be roughly 11 percent lower than in those areas farther out — and in a similar analysis, they\nfound a 17 percent diﬀerence in Chicago.\nEngineering created a means for speeding people and goods between ci�es and from city centers and\ninto suburbia, and beyond. The Interstate Highway System was an enormous achievement, and it created\nbig beneﬁts for some. It also had enormous costs for others, especially residents of central ci�es.\nBut engineering now has the opportunity to mi�gate some of that damage, to eliminate barriers to\nameni�es, and in the process, create new economic incen�ves for folks to move back and opportuni�es\nfor those who stayed.\n\nSee Jeﬀrey Brinkman and Jeﬀrey Lin, “The Costs and Beneﬁts of Fixing Downtown Freeways,” Economic Insights,\nQ1 2022, available at philadelphiafed.org.\n2\n\n5\n\n\fWe know, through both anecdotal evidence and through fron�er research, that more people, especially\nyoung college graduates, are looking anew at urban living. 34 New work from home op�ons means that\nci�es and towns are compe�ng even more on the quality of life they can oﬀer residents. Addi�onally,\ntraﬃc throughout the Philadelphia Metro area has become so endemic that one of those ini�al beneﬁts\nof living in the suburbs — speedy access to the urban core — has been all but eliminated.\nThe Philadelphia waterfront today is a place where former warehouses and factories are being\nrepurposed and renovated for residen�al and more ground-level commercial uses. The Delaware River\nitself is also a cleaner estuary, and one which the city has con�nually sought to highlight for both\nresidents and tourists through projects like the Penn’s Landing Fes�val Pier, the mul�modal Delaware\nRiver Trail, and a just-started project to cap a one-10th of a mile por�on of I-95 at Penn’s Landing to\nbecome a new urban park.\nAnd Lin and Brinkman even looked at this last idea: capping I-95 to reconnect neighborhoods with\nameni�es. But they looked at a much bigger landscape than the current project, which is geared to only\na small part of I-95 adjacent to the neighborhoods directly east of Center City and the tourist and\nbusiness heart. They conceived of a project to cover a litle more than four miles of I-95 and simulated\nits poten�al impact. And what their simula�on suggests is a poten�al popula�on boom in those\nneighborhoods that I-95 eﬀec�vely cut oﬀ and to some extent emp�ed, as connec�ons between those\nneighborhoods and the city at-large were remade.\nThey also calculated that the beneﬁt to households in these neighborhoods at roughly $245 million per\nyear, or $3.5 billion over the life�me value of such a project, was greater than the es�mated current cost\nof undertaking such a program. These are big numbers. What they point to is the signiﬁcant damage that\nhighway construc�on did to central city neighborhoods. What they also point to are the signiﬁcant\ncurrent opportuni�es for remedia�ng that damage, if we can also focus on the value of these\ninvestments, instead of only the costs.\n\nSee Victor Couture and Jessie Handbury, “Urban Revival in America,” Journal of Urban Economics, September\n2020, available at ScienceDirect.\n3\n\nSee Nathaniel Baum-Snow and Daniel Hartley, “Accoun�ng for Central Neighborhood Change, 1980–2010,”\nJournal of Urban Economics, 117, May 2020, available at ScienceDirect.\n4\n\n6\n\n\fBut it’s not just about plan�ng grass. While parks and open space are vital, we cannot discount\ninfrastructure that could link neighborhoods together. Public transit has poten�ally a large role to play\nhere. With limited excep�ons of, for example, the New York City Subway or Boston’s T, we o�en think of\nmass transit mostly in terms of bringing suburbanites back into ci�es. In Philadelphia, for example, the\nregional Southeastern Pennsylvania Transporta�on Authority (SEPTA) is o�en skewered by\nPhiladelphians for a percep�on that it caters mostly to suburbanites — a gripe rooted in the fact that\nprepandemic, from 2007 to 2017, SEPTA’s suburban-based Regional Rail system received the plurality of\nthe agency’s capital funds even though inner-city transit atracted far more riders. 5 Fair or not,\npercep�on maters and can sway public acceptance.\nAgain, this is an area where there is guiding research from the Philadelphia Fed. Economic Advisor and\nEconomist Chris Severen looked at the economic beneﬁts of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system, an\nambi�ous eﬀort to draw people from the epicenter of the na�on’s car culture out of their autos and into\nmass transit. 6\nWhat Severen found was a 15 percent increase in transit use when Angelenos were commu�ng from one\nneighborhood to another directly connected by Metro Rail. The increase in Metro Rail commu�ng in\ndirectly adjacent census tracts was 10 percent.\nA common concern these days with local infrastructure investments is who beneﬁts. Are the beneﬁts\ngoing to incumbent residents who may have been harmed by past policy? Or are they going to incoming\nresidents who end up displacing exis�ng residents? On the other hand, some people might worry that\ntransit access might actually hurt neighborhoods, for example, by introducing more noise or conges�on.\nInteres�ngly, in the LA Metro case, these neighborhoods did not experience a lot of disrup�ve change.\nThe appearance of a Metro Rail sta�on did not bring in a new wealthy subset. What Metro Rail primarily\ndid was to enhance resident choice of transporta�on op�ons. It added an amenity in which residents\nfound an intrinsic value — the ability to ditch their car. The added beneﬁts of those cars that were kept\noﬀ the streets, in terms of traﬃc, noise, and pollu�on, just become a bonus. More than that, it may have\n\nSee Jim Saksa, “SEPTA Riders Overwhelmingly Take the Bus and Subway. Why Does Regional Rail Receive More\nFunding?” May 2017, available at WHYY.\n5\n\nSee Christopher Severen, “A Ticket to Ride: Es�ma�ng the Beneﬁts of Rail Transit,” Economic Insights, Q2 2020,\navailable at philadelphiafed.org.\n6\n\n7\n\n\fchanged percep�ons of transit as something only for the suburbs or wealthy residents. Again, this kind\nof research is helping us learn about the value of transporta�on infrastructure — the long-range\neconomic and quality of life beneﬁts.\nSuch infrastructure projects may be cri�cal in undoing one of the great transporta�on engineering\ninjus�ces of all. We now know that highways cut oﬀ people from opportuni�es today. But this might\nunderstate their nega�ve eﬀects on the next genera�on tomorrow — through increased racial\nsegrega�on and the decreased intergenera�onal economic opportuni�es that con�nue to this day.\nAnd this brings me to a third bit of research in which the Philadelphia Fed was involved. Economic\nAdvisor and Economist Bryan Stuart recently teamed up with researchers from the University of Texas\nand UCLA. 7 Their window into these intergenera�onal eﬀects was to look at the long-term economic\nimpacts from the historical placement of railroads. And they found, true to the cliché, that there was a\n“wrong side of the tracks.” The placement of railroad tracks cemented segrega�on within communi�es\nand limited the upward mobility of speciﬁcally Black children who the tracks separated from community\nameni�es such as schools and jobs.\nWe can see this in Philadelphia, too, which has the unfortunate dis�nc�on of being the “poorest big city”\nin the na�on, and the 11th most racially segregated 8 with a citywide poverty rate above 20 percent. But\nis this just a mater of bad luck for these families who ﬁnd themselves below the poverty line? The\nresearch conducted by the Philadelphia Fed would say no. Many of these outcomes were caused by past\npolicies. Many of them could be addressed through transporta�on infrastructure investments today to\nbeter connect workers, families, and opportuni�es.\nIn 2022, Larry Santucci, a senior advisor and research fellow at the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance\nIns�tute, released his work in which he mapped the history of racial covenants at nearly 4,000 proper�es\n\nSee Eric Chyn, Kareem Haggag, and Bryan Stuart, “The Eﬀects of Racial Segrega�on on Intergenera�onal\nMobility: Evidence from Historical Railroad Placement,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper\n23-18 (2023), htps://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/regional-economics/eﬀects-of-racial-segrega�onon-intergenera�onal-mobility-evidence-historical-railroad-placement.\n7\n\n8\n\nSee “A Map of Racially Restric�ve Covenants in the City of Philadelphia,” Consumer Finance Data,\n\nhtps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/consumer-ﬁnance-data/racial-covenants.\n\n8\n\n\fcitywide. 9 Racially restric�ve covenants were one of the tools that early 20th century developers, home\nbuilders, and White homeowners used to prevent non-White individuals from accessing certain\nneighborhoods and homes. Allow me a moment to explain the ﬁndings in Santucci’s own words:\nWe didn’t see a lot in areas of the city where the housing stock was older, such as\nalong the Delaware waterfront, where White residents may have been happy to vacate\n… But we did ﬁnd racial covenants bordering White and non-White neighborhoods and\ncordoning oﬀ the up-and-coming, more suburban areas in the Northeast, Northwest,\nand Southwest sec�ons of Philadelphia.\nOn a map, many of the areas of Philadelphia directly impacted by the growth of highways and the White\nﬂight it enabled stand out in this proposi�on. Santucci speciﬁcally notes the Delaware River waterfront,\nthe example with which I opened this talk. But even today, residents in the majority Black neighborhoods\nof Philadelphia and the surrounding region face commute �mes, on average, that are 34 minutes longer\nper week than their White counterparts. Or put another way, in the span of a year, Black commuters lose\na whole 24-hour day in commu�ng �me that White commuters keep for themselves. That was the\nﬁnding of another recent report by Severen and his Research Analyst Nassir Holden. 10\nThis research can serve as the star�ng place for engineers and local oﬃcials, if not indeed federal ones,\nto take a more holis�c approach to transporta�on. Simply making repairs, while necessary, in many ways\nwill only extend or even exacerbate long-standing inequi�es and inequali�es. Simply making a repair to a\nfreeway that stands as an impediment to economic progress and equity won’t remove it as an\nimpediment — it will only solidify its standing for more years.\nSimply valuing infrastructure in the same old way, usually by the ﬂow of cars or people, is self-limi�ng.\nWe should start valuing its beneﬁts in greater totality, and especially the beneﬁts to those who are\nsituated near these projects. And the Philadelphia Fed’s research is helping us to beter deﬁne these\nbeneﬁts.\n\nSee “Q&A: Larry Santucci on Philadelphia’s Racially Restric�ve Covenants and Their Las�ng Eﬀects,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia, available at philadelphiafed.org.\n9\n\nChristopher Severen and Nassir Holden, “Not All Rush Hours Are the Same,” Economic Insights, Q3 2023,\navailable at philadelphiafed.org.\n10\n\n9\n\n\fBut certainly, these improvements will not just happen on their own or through the benevolence of\nothers. We must pay for them. Local governments collect taxes, some of which are used for local\ninfrastructure, but most infrastructure projects have costs that require them to be bonded out over\nyears. Those funds allow for construc�on workers to be employed and for materials to be purchased.\nAnd that is where the Federal Reserve’s ac�ons can have an impact and where I, as a member of the\nFOMC, recognize my place in this transporta�on future, if even just tangen�ally. But our ac�ons on\nmonetary policy do have a direct impact on the borrowing rates for such bonds, among so much more.\nOur eﬀorts to tame inﬂa�on mean stabilizing the costs of construc�on and labor.\nAnd with that, I would like to give you a brief overview of my overall economic outlook. As you are\naware, a week ago, at our last mee�ng, the FOMC voted to hold the policy rate steady — our second\nconsecu�ve hold and the third in the last four mee�ngs a�er 10 consecu�ve interest rate hikes.\nI not only voted to support keeping the policy rate steady, but I was also among the ﬁrst of my colleagues\nto state my posi�on that the �me had come to do so, possibly for a while. Let’s rewind for a moment.\nWe did a lot in not a lot of �me. We rapidly moved monetary policy into restric�ve territory to tame\ninﬂa�on and get it heading back down to our target of a 2 percent annual rate.\nNow, what we didn’t do was give the folks living in this economy, whether businesses or families, a lot of\n�me to adjust in between rate hikes. And today, if you look along the trend lines, we are experiencing a\nslow but steady disinﬂa�on. Interest rates remain in restric�ve territory and, so long as they are, they\nwill con�nue to put a damper on inﬂa�on.\nYes, this economy is proving to be resilient and at �mes unwilling to bend to the will of economic\nmodels, but I believe that the path we are on is the correct one.\nI am not going to be swayed easily by a single month’s worth of data. One month can just be an outlier\nand not a harbinger. But we don’t know unless we have more outward months to weigh against it. With\nmonetary policy, there are always lags. Holding the rate steady will give those lags �me to catch up. It\nwill allow us to make more measured and educated policy rate decisions going forward — decisions,\nwhich I must add, could go either way, depending upon what the data tell us.\n10\n\n\fBut for the moment, as I said, I see a slow but steady disinﬂa�on occurring. I s�ll expect inﬂa�on to fall\nbelow 3 percent year over year in 2024 and to get down to our 2 percent target therea�er.\nI do expect GDP growth to cool oﬀ in the coming quarters, but I do not expect a recession.\nConsumers have been powering recent GDP growth — more than half of last quarter’s increase was due\nto consumers con�nuing to open their wallets. Time will tell if they have exhausted their pandemic-era\nsavings and begin to ratchet down their own spending. Time will tell the full impact of the restart of\nstudent loan payments for countless borrowers. But I would also argue that a conﬁdent American\nconsumer is not a problem. Indeed, they may be the ones ul�mately capable of helping us achieve the\nso� landing we all envision and that has proved quite elusive in the past.\nIt is also clear that the labor market is coming into a much beter balance. I an�cipate the\nunemployment rate to end the year slightly elevated from where it currently stands — to about 4\npercent — and to rise slowly in 2024 to about 4.5 percent before dropping again to 4 percent. That\nwould put us back in line with the natural rate of unemployment, where the labor market and steady 2\npercent inﬂa�on can coexist in balance.\nOf course, there are many lurking uncertain�es. The posi�ve movements to setle the auto worker\nstrikes give us hope that things may soon return to normal for workers and employers. But even then,\nthere are s�ll other labor ac�ons that are slowing down other industries, such as the actors’ strike.\nWe are also now only nine days away from a poten�al federal government shutdown, the impact of\nwhich would only grow the longer it goes on and could poten�ally trim a full percentage point oﬀ fourth\nquarter GDP. And of course, there are interna�onal issues that can impact our own economy.\nBut at the end of the day, while I see us on the path of taming inﬂa�on and protec�ng our economic\nunderpinnings, I would also cau�on that a decrease in the policy rate is not something that is likely to\nhappen in the short term. I ascribe to the posi�on that rates are going to have to remain higher for\nlonger, as the other downward pressures on inﬂa�on work in tandem with the current policy rate to\nreturn our economy to balance.\n11\n\n\fAnd for transporta�on, this higher-rate climate may have an impact on our ability to see some new\nprojects get from the drawing board to shovels in the ground. The necessary repairs will s�ll be done,\nand projects already begun will con�nue.\nBut progress is something for which America has always been known. And the more we take our eyes\nexclusively oﬀ the costs of a project to the overall economic beneﬁt of a project, the more we will see\nthat price tags, while important, aren’t the only thing to consider.\nWe can s�ll, if we take the research into considera�on, make Oscar Wilde proud.\nAnd with that, I will conclude my prepared remarks for this evening. I once again thank you all for the\nprivilege to be here. I would be happy to take your ques�ons.\n\n12\n\n\f"

I arrived at this decision after carefully reviewing\nboth the hard data and what I’ve been hearing directly from contacts throughout the Third District.\nFurther, economic and financial conditions are continuing to evolve as I have been expecting, though I\nam keeping a close eye on the latest data. There has not been the abrupt shift in data that would lead\nme to change my current position.\nThe available data for September have mostly come out stronger than I expected. The latest on retail\nsales confirms that households retained spending power and did not seem shy to use it over the\nsummer. A resilient consumer is not a problem. Indeed, perhaps the key tenet of a soft landing is that\nhouseholds get to adjust their plan for when and how it best serves them — as opposed to the kind of\ndrastic, unavoidable adjustments that come with, say, suddenly losing their job.\nTruthfully, the momentum in consumer spending is a bit of a head-scratcher. Contacts talk of a more\ncautious, price-sensitive consumer. Major surveys also show a steady drop in consumer confidence since\nthe summer. But there could have been some specific factors at play over the summer that we have yet\nto fully parse out, or we could be right at a turning point, or perhaps the fundamentals are even\nstronger for households.\nLet me stop here to state three things. First, we are not going to tolerate a reacceleration in prices.\nSecond, while I stand ready to revise my views and act accordingly if I see signs of reinflation, I am also\nnot going to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability in data.\nAnd third, we must remain data dependent, and that includes making sure we separate that which could\njust be noise from that which could be an actual signal. But to make that differentiation — and make it\nwith certainty, as we must — we will need several months of data that we can average.\nAnd this also includes data from the impacts of lingering uncertainties to which we must remain\nattuned. Prolonged labor strikes, the restart of student loan payments, and international events each\ncome with their own set of economic effects. But we won’t necessarily know their extent for some time.\nWe will need to see the data.\n2\n\n\fThe mechanics of the economy cannot be rushed. We raised the policy rate by more than 5 percentage\npoints in the span of a little more than a year. That’s a lot of change in not a lot of time. We know that\nthe full impacts of those increases may not yet be fully absorbed across the economy. We also turned\naround our balance sheet with near equal speed. We put ourselves in restrictive territory very quickly.\nBut the speed with which we worked then is also part of my argument for holding steady now. As I\nnoted, policy rates are restrictive, and holding them steady now will keep us in restrictive territory and\nsteadily pressing down on inflation. This is a time where doing nothing is doing something, and, in fact,\nI’d argue that it equates to doing quite a lot.\nSo, allow me to quickly give you my projections based on this stance.\nFirst, on inflation: While headline PCE inflation remains elevated above target, it is almost half of what it\nwas last year on a year-over-year basis. And August’s monthly reading was the smallest month-overmonth increase since 2020. The data I see, and all that I hear, point to a steady disinflation that is\nalready under way and sustained, if slow. My projections have inflation dropping below 3 percent in\n2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent target thereafter.\nI expect GDP growth, which has been outperforming estimates from earlier this year, to continue\nthrough the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But while I anticipate the rate of GDP\ngrowth to moderate, I do not anticipate a contraction. I do not project a recession.\nAnd looking at jobs, I anticipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — just slightly above\nwhat the unemployment rate is now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5\npercent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. This path would put the unemployment figure in\nline with the natural rate of unemployment, or that theoretical level where labor market conditions\nsupport stable 2 percent inflation.\nNow, this does not mean that I expect mass layoffs. I do not. There are multiple factors that can all\ninfluence unemployment rates, including technological changes in the workplace, more workers\n\n3\n\n\freentering the labor force, or other public policy choices that may impact workers’ decisions regarding\ntheir own jobs. And sometimes these forces simultaneously exert their push and pull.\nSo, when we look at all of this, my view is that we need to exhale, allow the policy actions we’ve taken\nto continue to work, and closely watch the data before making any decisions on moving the policy rate\nin either direction. A resolute, but patient, stance on monetary policy will allow us to achieve the soft\nlanding that we all wish for our economy.\nNow, as for when I anticipate rates coming back down? That is a question to which I don’t yet have an\nanswer. My forecasts are based on what I know as of now. And as time goes by, as adjustments are\ncompleted, as new data emerge, and as we gain additional insight on the underlying trends, I may need\nto adjust my forecasts, and with them, my time frames. Suffice it to say, rates will need to stay high for a\nwhile.\nNow, let me briefly turn our attention to banking and financial conditions as we currently see them in\nthe Third District. Bill and I will be able to dive more deeply into this area with you during our discussion.\nBut here are the broad strokes.\nI’ll start by recognizing that, overall, current capital levels remain adequate as institutions across the\nDistrict continue to have sufficient liquidity. Thankfully, banks throughout the District have not\nexperienced widespread drop-offs in deposits, and deposit levels have been on a return upward toward\nhistorical levels. Earnings remain strong, though an increase in interest expense remains a concern.\nBusiness lending has continued, though it was reported to me by contacts that many borrowers have\nbeen turning their focus to their “must haves,” not their “like to haves.” The decrease in mortgage\nactivity has been notable, as has been widely reported — and certainly this is true both here in our\nregion and nationwide. Asset quality throughout lending portfolios has remained favorable.\nThirty-day delinquency rates among all active loans, while trending higher, remain below their historical\nand prepandemic levels.\n\n4\n\n\fHowever, with all of this comes both interest rate and liquidity risks as deposits return to their\nprepandemic levels, the funding gap that it is creating, and the balance sheet impacts of the increases in\npolicy rates.\nOne of the largest concerns to me, at least in the immediate Philadelphia area, remains the commercial\nreal estate (CRE) sector. Office vacancy rates remain above their prepandemic levels, while office net\nabsorption rates remain stubbornly negative. The placement of the Wanamaker Building, arguably one\nof this city’s premier addresses, into receivership looms large.\nHowever, District-wide, it has been reported through contacts that CRE portfolios aren’t necessarily\nfacing the same risks as here in Philadelphia. As one contact relayed, the local dentist offices aren’t\ngoing to remote work. So, overall, CRE lending and loan performance remains sound.\nOn the operational side, we have continued to urge our contacts to remain vigilant to cyberattacks and\nto carefully monitor any novel tech-driven activities with which they may become engaged, including in\ncrypto and partnerships with nonbanks to deliver financial services to customers.\nBut, again, throughout the District, the banking sector remains strong and not broadly impacted by the\nspring’s banking turmoil. Customers can have faith in their deposits and in their financial institutions.\nLook, overall, we continue to be in a sound region of the country. Earlier this week, at a prior event, I\nwas asked about our region’s economic health. My response was the following: Philadelphia doesn’t\nseem to ride the highs or lows that other regional economies do; we seem to always just keep going.\nAnd that is where I would put us at this moment. Our region continues to move along. We see positive\nsigns for our economy and our collective future.\nI think that’s good point for me to end. I am sure you have questions, and I am eager to get to them.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fFuture Monetary Landscape Is Being Painted by\nBoth Hard and Soft Data\nChartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Society Philadelphia’s 80th Anniversary Celebration\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 19, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood evening.\nThank you, Floyd, for that welcome and introduction, and my thanks to you and to Executive Director\nPete Conners for putting together this evening’s program.\nI thank each of you as well for joining us this evening, given there is, shall we say, a competing event. I\nmust note that this is the second time in as many weeks in which Major League Baseball did not first\nconsult the Philadelphia Fed’s event calendar when making the Phillies’ playoff schedule. However,\nwhile I’m not particularly superstitious, when this happened last week, the Phillies won 10-2, so maybe\nthere’s something to this after all. But just in case, I’m wearing my Phillies tie.\nI also congratulate you for the reason we’re all here tonight — to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the\nCFA Society Philadelphia. Membership in an organization such as this isn’t just a good thing to have for\nthe networking opportunities or even for the chance to hear a Federal Reserve Bank president opine on\nmonetary policy. It’s also good for the industry and for your clients, as it puts confidence in your\ncommitment to them and their financial futures and in the high standards of governance espoused by\nthe CFA Society Philadelphia.\nNow, speaking of monetary policy, I plan on sharing my overall thoughts and insights on the economic\nlandscape before us — both nationally and in our region. Then, as Floyd said, we’ll get this podium out\nof the way and get to having a conversation where we can drill down on specific issues. And believe me,\nas much as I may enjoy standing up here, I much more enjoy engaging in direct conversation.\n1\n\n\fBut before we can get to any of this, there is one piece of business to which I must attend, and that is\nthe usual Federal Reserve disclaimer: The views I express this evening are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nI’ve recently boiled this down to the following: Anything I say tonight is a simple matter of “Pat said,”\nnot “The Fed said.” So, let’s use that.\nAs you can imagine, the thing I get asked about most — whether by the press, audiences such as\nyourselves, or even my friends — is interest rates.\nSo, let me begin by painting my picture of the economic landscape with the following broad\nbrushstroke: Over the past several months, I have been clear in my view that, absent a stark turnabout\nin the data that I see and the on-the-ground testimonies of contacts that I hear, I believe that we are at\nthe point where we can hold rates where they are. And so far, economic and financial conditions are\nevolving roughly as I expected, though I am keeping a close eye on the latest data, which have come in a\ntad stronger than my baseline forecast.\nLet me roll back the clock a bit to 2022, when we started the pivot to a restrictive stance.\nIn a span of barely over a year, we not only did a lot, but we did it very fast. The policy rate went up by\nmore than 5 percentage points, reaching its highest level in more than two decades. We also turned\naround our balance sheet policy, and we turned it around fast.\nThe speed in which we worked then is also part of my argument for holding steady now. The workings of\nthe economy cannot be rushed, and we know there are lags, which mean that the full impacts of the\nhigher rates may not yet be fully absorbed. I heard this very clearly from my discussions with contacts\nacross the financial sector throughout the summer, as my viewpoint evolved to its current state.\n\n2\n\n\fAnother part of my argument can be summarized this way: Doing nothing is doing something. And I\nthink doing nothing at this moment equates to doing quite a lot. As long as policy rates remain\nrestrictive, we will keep steadily pressing down on inflation and bringing markets into better balance.\nAnd I further believe that a resolute, but patient, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the\nsoft landing that we all wish for our economy.\nLook at the latest data on PCE inflation — it may have remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year\nover year, but it is down 3 percentage points from this time last year. Even when the volatile aspects of\nenergy and food costs are stripped away to give us the core measure of PCE inflation that economists\nbelieve is a better harbinger of trends, we also see clear signs of progress. In fact, the August monthly\nreading was its smallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\nNow, that said, the available data for September have mostly come out stronger than I expected. The\nlatest on retail sales confirms that households retained spending power and did not seem shy to use it\nover the summer. A resilient consumer is not a problem. Indeed, perhaps the key tenet of a soft landing\nis that households get to adjust their plan for when and how it best serves them — as opposed to the\nkind of drastic, unavoidable adjustments that come with, say, suddenly losing their job.\nTruthfully, the momentum in consumer spending is a bit of a head-scratcher. Contacts talk of a more\ncautious, price-sensitive consumer. Major surveys also show a steady drop in consumer confidence since\nthe summer. But there could have been some specific factors at play over the summer that we have yet\nto fully parse out, or we could be right on a turning point, or perhaps the fundamentals are even\nstronger for households.\nWe simply do not know. But we know that we do not know, and I believe that we should proceed\naccordingly: with caution and patience.\nLet me be clear, though. Certainly, we are not going to tolerate a reacceleration in prices. I stand ready\nto revise my views and act accordingly if I see signs of reinflation. However, I am not going to overreact\nto normal month-to-month variability in the data.\n\n3\n\n\fAnd for all the fancy techniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data\nover several months. Of course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn,\ndemands that, yes, we remain data dependent but patient and cautious with the data.\nAnd the data I do see, and all what I hear, point to a steady disinflation that is already under way and\nsustained, if slow. My projections have inflation dropping below 3 percent in 2024 and leveling out at\nour 2 percent target thereafter.\nOf course, there’s much more than just the policy rate at work here. There are numerous outside factors\nthat are working in parallel with it to further push down on inflation.\nFor those in this room, I don’t think I need to do much more than to point to the bond markets as a\nproof point. Certainly, the impacts of restrictive policy on bond prices across the yield curve are exerting\ntheir own pressures — and creating their own challenges along with it.\nAnd, of course, there are also the tighter overall credit conditions that have existed since the collapses\nof Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic several months ago. In speaking with contacts\nover the summer, I heard that even while activity slowed, credit quality did not lag overall. Business\nlending continued for many, though it was reported to me that many borrowers were focusing more on\nfinancing for their “must haves,” not their “like to haves.”\nThere are other pressures that must be considered, too. The continued turmoil in the labor market is\nlikely to similarly exert downward pressure on the economy — not just in the loss of overall economic\nactivity but in the immediate impact on consumer spending as striking workers go without their usual\nwages.\nThere’s also another elephant in this room, and that is the resumption of student loan payments. Again,\nwe do not yet know the full scope this will have on consumer spending and savings, but we know that\nwe do not know, so I am keeping a close eye on the matter.\nAnd finally, we cannot forget that events around the world, and the uncertainty they bring, can have a\nreal impact on our economy here at home. We are all watching, and in many cases praying about, the\n4\n\n\ftragic situation in Israel and the Middle East, stemming from those recent terrorist attacks. And there is\nstill Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Those are just two examples.\nSo, taking this all together, the picture painted is one that, I believe, shows that allowing the policy rate\nto remain steady is the prudent position.\n“Well, Pat, that’s all well and good, but when are rates going to come down,” I hear you ask.\nI wish I had an answer for you, but at this moment, I don’t. My forecasts are based on what I know as of\nnow. And as time goes by, as adjustments are completed, as new data emerge, and as we gain\nadditional insight on the underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them, my time\nframes. So, as inexact as the term “higher for longer” sounds and is, it’s the best way I have to answer\nthat question. Rates will need to stay high for a while.\nIt is not just the data that will signal to me when the time comes to adjust policy either way, but what I\nalso hear from contacts and through outreach.\nAnd I must note that while I really do not expect it, should inflation rebound, I would not hesitate to\nsupport further rate increases as our objective to return inflation to target is, simply, not negotiable.\nAgain, I say this with all the forecast data I have at this moment. And at this moment, I expect the\neconomy’s overall resilience to continue. Its underpinnings remain strong.\nFor starters, GDP growth has been outperforming estimates from earlier this year, and I do expect GDP\ngains to continue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But do not conflate a\nmore moderate rate of GDP growth as a contraction. I do not anticipate a recession.\nOn the jobs front, I anticipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — which is just slightly\nabove where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5 percent,\nbefore heading back toward 4 percent in 2025.\n\n5\n\n\fThis path would put the unemployment figure in line with the natural rate of unemployment, or that\ntheoretical level where labor market conditions support stable 2 percent inflation.\nNow, this does not mean that I expect mass layoffs. I do not.\nFirst, we have seen months where the unemployment rate increased because more workers moved off\nthe sidelines and back into the labor force. I expect us to continue to have such months. And second, I\nhave to also balance the soft data I receive from my discussions with contacts — and many have related\nthat, given how hard they’ve worked to find the workers they currently have, they are doing all they can\nto hold onto them.\nThe economic indicators tracked by the Philadelphia Fed also give me reason to feel positive about the\npath forward.\nAmong our most closely watched indicators are the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing business\noutlook surveys conducted with firms throughout the Third District. The latest Manufacturing Business\nOutlook Survey came out this morning. Now, while firms in both of the most recent surveys noted\ndeclines in month-over-month activity, the six-month outlooks reported in each remained optimistic\noverall.\nIn addition, we also publish a monthly summary metric of economic activity: the State Coincident\nIndexes. And in each state in our region — Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — the overall longrange trend continues to be positive.\nSuch optimism is also borne out in some of the other hard data points we look at, including business\nformation. And here I would note, specifically, that the numbers of applications for high-propensity\nbusinesses — those expected to turn into firms with payroll — remain elevated across the board in the\nThird District when compared with prepandemic levels. And I also see the data showing that hotel\noccupancy rates, while not yet back to prepandemic levels, have continued to rebound.\nI do take these as promising signs.\n\n6\n\n\fOf course, there are areas in which we have some concern. And specifically, I’ll note the commercial real\nestate (CRE) sector. Office vacancy rates continue to be well above their prepandemic levels. Office\nspace net absorption rates in the Philadelphia region continue to be negative. I do have some anxiety\nthat last month’s transition of the Wanamaker Building into receivership isn’t going to be a one-off\nevent.\nAnd to be clear, to me, the issues surrounding CRE aren’t just about the investments in the buildings\nthemselves but also about the livelihoods of the businesses — especially the small businesses — which\nsurround them and which are simply not getting anywhere near the foot traffic they did just a few years\nago.\nNow, I really want to step away from this podium and get to our conversation. But before we do, let me\nto pose the following question, which has nagged at me for months now as I’ve taken in data and\nformulated my position on the future direction of monetary policy: What in the economy has\nfundamentally changed from, say, 2018 or 2019?\nIn 2018, inflation averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point and was actually below target in 2019.\nUnemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was as low as 3.5 percent, while policy\nrates peaked below 2.5 percent.\nNow, I’m not saying that we’re going to be able to exactly replicate prepandemic economic conditions.\nBut the resilience of this economy is making me rethink some of the classic models.\nAnd that’s probably a good thing. After all, I’m not a classically trained economist — by education, I’m\nan engineer. And if you know anything about engineers, we’re always willing to challenge previous\nassumptions and to look outside the box.\nAnd if there’s something else about engineers, we’re also really good at judging the limits of a system,\nand I think I’ve just about hit my limit on my prepared remarks. I am eager to get to our conversation.\nSo, Floyd, why don’t we do away with this podium and get to it.\nBut one last thing: Go Phillies!\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fPutting Research to Work So Job Quality Equals Job Quantity\nWelcome Remarks\nPeople, Possibilities, Practice: Designing a Better Future for Workers\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 18, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Philadelphia Fed.\nThank you, Susie Kendis, for that introduction and to you and your colleagues at Deloitte for yesterday’s\nconference, which laid significant groundwork for these next two days of discussions.\nI also thank our friends at Working Nation, the City of Philadelphia, and Drexel University’s Lindy\nInstitute for helping us put together this series of events.\nNow, a quick reminder of the usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThis is an exciting event for me as it gives me the opportunity to highlight some of the truly\ngroundbreaking research going on under this roof. It may be easy to think of the Federal Reserve only in\nterms of monetary policy and interest rates and such — and I honestly can’t blame you — but the work\nwe do here every day is varied, dynamic, and truly impactful as you will see.\nAs you may know, for nearly 50 years, the Federal Reserve has worked according to the dual mandate\nthat Congress handed down to us. One pillar of this dual mandate is price stability. That’s the one you\nread about most in the news as we continue our efforts to wrestle inflation back down to our 2 percent\nannual target. And as an aside, we are making steady progress, but more remains to be done.\n\n1\n\n\fThe other — equally important, if somewhat less reported — is to promote maximum employment. But\nwhat does that mean, maximum employment? Well, I look at it as a two-way proposition. It’s not just\npromoting economic conditions through which employers can open their doors for workers to come in.\nJob growth is important, but it’s not the end-all, be-all.\nFor me, maximum employment also means promoting a climate in which workers in those jobs are\ntreated with respect and dignity, and where work isn’t just something to be rewarded but something\nthat is truly rewarding. Put another way, while the quantity of available jobs is important, so, too, is the\nquality of those jobs.\nSo, it is upon the pillar of maximum employment in which we find the Worker Voices Project.\nYesterday, I published an article on the Philadelphia Fed’s website with my perspective on some of what\nthe Worker Voices Project tells us. If you have not yet done so, I do encourage you to read it — just\nmaybe not at this very moment. But allow me to give you a couple of spoilers.\nI opened my article with a direct quote from one of the many workers interviewed through the Worker\nVoices Project, who said, “I know that I can bring a lot to the table. Are you going to uphold your end of\nthe half as an employer?”\nAnd I closed the article by writing the following: “I am proud that our research is being put into action\ntoward innovations that can meet the needs of our workforce while forging the strong economy of\ntomorrow. And this research is not just going to benefit us as economists but, ultimately, more so as a\nsociety.”\nThis brings me to this event today and the further discussions that will take place tomorrow.\nAs economists, we have many tools and models through which we can study the forces that exert their\npush and pull on the labor market and those participating in it. Make no mistake, these hard data are\nimportant. Hard data give us — pun fully intended — concrete points, which, through time, we can\nidentify employment trends, identify precursors of labor force realignments, and support potential\nchanges in public policy.\n2\n\n\fFrom what I said a moment ago, the hard data tell us a lot about the quantity of jobs.\nBut even for all its strengths and directional guidance, the hard data cannot tell us what is going on at\nthe most micro level — the decisions individual workers are making about their own futures. These soft\ndata, the data reported through the Worker Voices Project, are a critically important supplement to the\nhard data. Actually, strike that, it’s not a supplement; it’s a full-fledged partner. We need to look at both,\nequally.\nAnd when looking at the Worker Voices Project, I see the means for us to coalesce around basic\nprinciples that classic economics cannot capture in a model or on a chart. This is what comes to my mind\nwhen I hear the phrase “research in action.”\nIf you don’t know, even though I sit as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed, economics wasn’t my\nfirst pursuit. By education, I’m an engineer. And if you know one thing about engineers, we cannot just\nlet things be, when we know, deep down, systems can be made more efficient, more effective, and even\nmore fair.\nThere’s nothing that an engineer enjoys more than lifting the cover and looking at what’s going on\nunderneath. And there’s nothing that an engineer enjoys less than hearing that something can’t be\nchanged because “that’s just the way we do things.”\nAnd this is what we’re doing here — we’re lifting the cover to see how we can make the labor market\nwork more efficiently, effectively, and fairly for workers. And, over the course of the next two days,\nwe’re not going to allow ourselves to be limited by the old ways of thinking.\nThat’s not being anti-employer. Far from it. As I have traveled across the Third District and talked with\nemployers, I hear directly how hard they’re working to find the employees their businesses need to be\nsuccessful — and once these employees are in, they don’t want to lose them.\n\n3\n\n\fYet, many of these employers are sticking only to the means through which they’ve attracted workers in\nthe past — namely, higher wages and more benefits. And not surprisingly, they are finding these tools\nalone aren’t as effective as they once were.\nThe Worker Voices Project, and the discussions and actionable research stemming from it, is a means\nthrough which we can provide these employers new and better tools to attract and retain workers.\nThese are the workers who can see their values reflected in those held by their employer and their value\nrewarded not just in terms of wages but in terms of being treated with dignity.\nNow, I could go on as my excitement for and belief in this transformational research is nearly\ninexhaustible — unlike attention spans. And every minute I give back is a minute we can spend hearing\nfrom the subject experts, who are doing the research, and those living it.\nSo, with that, I will yield the microphone. But, again, thank you all for coming this afternoon. I hope both\nthe rest of today’s forum and tomorrow’s working session are, like a good job, equally productive and\nrewarding.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\f“Doing Nothing” Is S�ll Doing a Lot\nNa�onal Associa�on of Corporate Directors Webinar\nNACD New Jersey and Philadelphia Chapters\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nOctober 16, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Oﬃcer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood a�ernoon, everyone.\nI appreciate that you’re all giving up part of the end of your workday for us to be together, if only\nvirtually.\nMy thanks to my good friend, Rick Mroz, for that welcome and introduc�on.\nI do believe we’re going to have a produc�ve session. But just so you all know, as much as I enjoy\nspeaking and providing my outlook, I enjoy a good conversa�on even more.\nSo, ﬁrst, let’s take a few minutes so I can give you my perspec�ve on where we are headed, and then I\nwill be more than happy to take ques�ons and hear what’s on your minds.\nBut before we get into any of that, I must begin with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express\ntoday are my own and do not necessarily reﬂect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommitee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nPut simply, this is one of those �mes where the opera�ve words are, “Pat said,” not “the Fed said.”\nNow, to begin, I’m going to ﬁrst address the two topics that I get asked about most o�en: interest rates\nand inﬂa�on. And I would guess they are the topics front and center in many of your minds as well.\n1\n\n\fA�er the FOMC’s last policy rate hike in July, I went on record with my view that, if economic and\nﬁnancial condi�ons evolved roughly as I expected they would, we could hold rates where they are. And I\nam pleased that, so far, economic and ﬁnancial condi�ons are evolving as I expected, if not perhaps even\na tad beter.\nLet’s look at the current dynamics. There is a steady, if slow, disinﬂa�on under way. Labor markets are\ncoming into beter balance. And, all the while, economic ac�vity has remained resilient.\nGiven this, I remain today where I found myself a�er July’s mee�ng: Absent a stark turnabout in the data\nand in what I hear from contacts, I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they\nare.\nIn barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by more than 5 percentage points and to its\nhighest level in more than two decades — 11 rate hikes in a span of 12 mee�ngs prior to September. We\nnot only did a lot, but we did it very fast.\nWe also turned around our balance sheet policy — and we will con�nue to �ghten ﬁnancial condi�ons\nby shrinking the balance sheet.\nThe workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some �me for the full impact of the\nhigher rates to be felt. In fact, I have heard a plea from countless contacts, asking to give them some\n�me to absorb the work we have already done.\nI agree with them. I am sure policy rates are restric�ve, and, as long they remain so, we will steadily\npress down on inﬂa�on and bring markets into a beter balance.\nHolding rates steady will let monetary policy do its work. By doing nothing, we are s�ll doing something.\nAnd I would argue we are doing quite a lot.\nHeadline PCE inﬂa�on remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year, but it is down 3\npercentage points from this �me last year. About half of that drop is due to the vola�le components of\n2\n\n\fenergy and food that, while basic necessi�es, they are typically excluded by economists in the so-called\ncore inﬂa�on rate to give a more accurate assessment of the pace of disinﬂa�on and its likely path\nforward.\nWell, core PCE inﬂa�on has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August monthly reading was its\nsmallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\nSo, yes, a steady disinﬂa�on is under way, and I expect it to con�nue. My projec�on is that inﬂa�on will\ndrop below 3 percent in 2024 and level out at our 2 percent target therea�er.\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinﬂa�on. For example, September’s CPI\nreport came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing.\nLet me be clear about two things. First, we will not tolerate a reaccelera�on in prices. But second, I do\nnot want to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices. And for all the fancy\ntechniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data over several months.\nOf course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn, demands that, yes, we\nremain data dependent but pa�ent and cau�ous with the data.\nTurning to the jobs picture, I do an�cipate na�onal unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent —\njust slightly above where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5\npercent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. That is a rate in line with what economists call\nthe natural rate of unemployment, or the theore�cal level in which labor market condi�ons support\nstable inﬂa�on at 2 percent.\nNow, that said, as you know, there are many factors that play into the calcula�on of the unemployment\nrate. For instance, we’ve seen recent months where, even as the economy added more jobs, the\nunemployment rate increased because more workers moved oﬀ the sidelines and back into the labor\nforce. There are many other dynamics at play, too, such as technological changes or public policy issues,\nlike child care or immigra�on, which directly impact employment.\n\n3\n\n\fAnd beyond the hard data, I also have to balance the so� data. For example, in my discussions with\nemployers throughout the Third District, I hear that given how hard they’ve worked to ﬁnd the workers\nthey currently have, they are doing all they can to hold onto them.\nSo, to sum up the labor picture, let me say, simply, I do not expect mass layoﬀs.\nI do expect GDP gains to con�nue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But even\nas I foresee the rate of GDP growth modera�ng, I do not see it contrac�ng. And, again, to put it simply, I\ndo not an�cipate a recession.\nLook, this economy has been nothing if not unpredictable. It has proven itself unwilling to s�ck to\ntradi�onal modeling and seems determined to not only bend some rules in one place, but to make up its\nown in another. However, as frustra�ngly unpredictable as it has been, it con�nues to move along.\nAnd this has led me to the following thought: What has fundamentally changed in the economy from,\nsay, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, inﬂa�on averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point and was actually\nbelow target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was as low as 3.5\npercent — both na�onwide and in our respec�ve states — while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent.\nNow, I’m not saying we’re going to be able to exactly replicate the prepandemic economy, but it is hard\nto ﬁnd fundamental diﬀerences. Surely, I cannot and will not minimize the immense impacts of the\npandemic on our lives and our families, nor the fact that for so many, the new normal s�ll does not feel\nnormal. From the cold lens of economics, I do not see underlying fundamental changes. I could also be\nwrong, and, trust me, that would not be the ﬁrst �me this economy has made me rethink some of the\nclassic models. We just won’t know for sure un�l we have more data to look at over �me.\nAnd then, of course, there are the economic uncertain�es — both na�onal and global — against which\nwe also must contend. The ongoing auto worker strike, among other labor ac�ons. The restart of student\nloan payments. The poten�al of a government shutdown. Fast-changing events in response to the tragic\natacks against Israel. Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Each and every one deserves a close watch.\n\n4\n\n\fThese are the broad economic signals we are picking up at the Philadelphia Fed, but I would note that\nthe regional ones we follow are also poin�ng us forward.\nFirst, while in the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent business outlook surveys, which survey manufacturing\nand nonmanufacturing ﬁrms in the Third District, month-over-month ac�vity declined, the six-month\noutlooks for each remain op�mis�c for growth.\nAnd we also publish a monthly summary metric of economic ac�vity, the State Coincident Indexes. In\nNew Jersey, the index is up slightly year over year through August, which shows generally posi�ve\ncondi�ons. However, the three-month number from June through August was down, and while both\npayroll employment and average hours worked in manufacturing increased during that �me, so did the\nunemployment rate — though a good part of that increase can be explained as more residents moved\nback into the labor force.\nAnd for those of you joining us from the western side of the Delaware River, Pennsylvania’s coincident\nindex is up more than 4 percent year over year through August and 1.7 percent since June. Payroll\nemployment was up, and the unemployment rate was down; however, the number of average hours\nworked in manufacturing decreased.\nThere are also promising signs in both states in terms of business forma�on. The number of applica�ons,\nspeciﬁcally, for high-propensity businesses — those expected to turn into ﬁrms with payroll — are\nremaining elevated compared with prepandemic levels. Again, a promising sign.\nSo, it is against this full backdrop that I have concluded that now is the �me at which the policy rate can\nremain steady. But I can hear you ask: “How long will rates need to stay high.” Well, I simply cannot say\nat this moment. My forecasts are based on what we know as of late 2023. As �me goes by, as\nadjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on the underlying trends, I may need\nto adjust my forecasts, and with them my �me frames.\nI can tell you three things about my views on future policy. First, I expect rates will need to stay high for a\nwhile.\n\n5\n\n\fSecond, the data and what I hear from contacts and outreach will signal to me when the �me comes to\nadjust policy either way. I really do not expect it, but if inﬂa�on were to rebound, I know I would not\nhesitate to support further rate increases as our objec�ve to return inﬂa�on to target is, simply, not\nnego�able.\nThird, I believe that a resolute, but pa�ent, monetary policy stance will allow us to achieve the soft\nlanding that we all wish for our economy.\nBefore I conclude and turn things over to Rick to kick oﬀ our Q&A, I do want to spend a moment on a\ntopic that he and I recently discussed, and it’s something about which I know there is generally great\ninterest: ﬁntech. In fact, I understand there is discussion about NACD hos�ng a conference on ﬁntech.\nWell, last month, we at the Philadelphia Fed hosted our Seventh Annual Fintech Conference, which\nbrought business and thought leaders together at the Bank for two days of real in-depth discussions. And\nI am extraordinarily proud of the fact that the Philadelphia Fed’s conference has emerged as one of the\npremier conferences on ﬁntech, anywhere. Not that it’s a compe��on.\nI had the pleasure of opening this year’s conference, which always puts a focus on shi�s in the ﬁntech\nlandscape. Much of this year’s conference centered around developments in digital currencies and\ncrypto — and, believe me, some of the discussions were a litle, shall we say, “spirited.” However, my\noverarching point to atendees was the following: Regardless of one’s views, whether in favor of or\nagainst such currencies, our reality requires us to move from thinking in terms of “what if” to thinking\nabout “what next.”\nIn many ways, we’re beyond the stage of thinking about crypto and digital currency and into the stage of\nhaving them as reality — just as AI has moved from being the stuﬀ of science ﬁc�on to the stuﬀ of\neveryday life. What is needed now is cri�cal thinking about what is next. And we at the Federal Reserve,\nboth here in Philadelphia and System-wide, are focused on being part of this discussion.\nWe are also focused on providing not just thought leadership but actionable leadership. For example,\nthe Fed rolled out our new FedNow instant payment service platform in July. With FedNow, we will have\na more nimble and responsive banking system.\n6\n\n\fTo be sure, FedNow is not the first instant payment system — other systems, whether operated by\nindividual banks or through third parties, have been operational for some time. But by allowing banks to\ninteract with each other quickly and efficiently to ensure one customer’s payment becomes another’s\ndeposit, we are fulfilling our role in providing a fair and equitable payment system.\nAnother area where the Fed is assuming a mantle of leadership is in quantum compu�ng, or QC, which\nhas the poten�al to revolu�onize security and problem-solving methodologies throughout the banking\nand ﬁnancial services industry. But that upside also comes with a real downside risk, should other notso-friendly actors co-opt QC for their own purposes.\nRight now, individual ins�tu�ons and other central banks globally are expanding their own research in\nQC. But just as these ins�tu�ons look to the Fed for economic leadership, so, too, are they looking to us\nfor technological leadership. So, I am especially proud that this System-wide eﬀort is being led from right\nhere at the Philadelphia Fed.\nI could go on and talk about ﬁntech for much longer. A�er all, I’m actually an engineer more than I am an\neconomist. But I know that Rick is interested in star�ng our conversa�on, and I am sure that many of you\nare ready to par�cipate.\nBut one last thought on ﬁntech — my answers today aren’t going to be generated by ChatGPT.\nOn that note, Rick, thanks for allowing me the �me to set up our discussion, and let’s start with the Q&A.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fGiving the Economy Time to Catch Its Breath\nMortgage Bankers Associa�on Annual Conven�on and Expo\nPennsylvania Conven�on Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 16, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Oﬃcer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning.\nMy thanks to the Mortgage Bankers Associa�on for the opportunity to be part of your annual conven�on\nand to Chair-elect Laura Escobar for that introduc�on.\nAnd, with that, welcome to the City of Philadelphia and the Third Federal Reserve District.\nI am honored to share this podium with my fellow speakers and to provide my outlook for economic\ncondi�ons moving forward.\nBut before I do that, there is one piece of business to which I must atend, and that is the usual Federal\nReserve disclaimer: The views I express are my own and do not necessarily reﬂect those of anyone else\non the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr, if I may give the Cliﬀs Notes version: When recoun�ng my remarks, please just say, “Pat said,” not\n“The Fed said.”\nLet me put it plainly: I stand here this morning fully aware of the mood in this room. And I am also fully\naware of the way the ac�ons we on the FOMC have taken over the past 18 months in our eﬀorts to tame\ninﬂa�on and get it back down to our 2 percent annual target have, in their own way, contributed to the\ncurrent mortgage climate.\n1\n\n\fAs you know, one of the pillars of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is price stability — ge�ng inﬂa�on\nback to that 2 percent annual target. And while I am sensi�ve to the impacts higher policy rates have\nhad, that goal remains job one.\nThroughout the summer, I traveled with my team throughout the Third District — as we do every year —\nto meet with community bankers and other contacts in their home communi�es, to talk about\ncondi�ons on the ground, to hear their perspec�ves and concerns, and to see ﬁrsthand the impacts of\nmonetary policy on the local level.\nSuﬃce it to say, the impact of rising mortgage rates was something that took front and center in nearly\nevery conversa�on. In fact, the climate could be crystalized in seven words, which one of those contacts\nsaid to me recently: “There are no ﬁrst-�me home buyers.”\nThat’s a stark assessment. And it is one I take without further parsing. The housing market is key for our\neconomy overall, not to men�on its greater importance for our society as a whole in ensuring that every\nfamily has access to a safe and aﬀordable place to call home.\nThe rise in interest rates not only raised borrowing costs on those looking to purchase a home, but it also\ncontributed to the contrac�on of inventory. It is completely understandable that current homeowners\nwon’t put their houses on the market and step away from their current low-rate mortgages.\nAnd it is just simple market dynamics that a lack of inventory would elevate prices overall, further\nlessening the depth of the pool of poten�al buyers.\nOf course, the other side of this coin is new home sales, which both the hard data show and our contacts\nrelay are trending upward throughout this period. This, too, makes sense from the view of market\ndynamics — the way around contrac�ng inventory in exis�ng homes is to purchase a home that didn’t\nexist before. And we know these homes o�en come with atrac�ve ameni�es and features an exis�ng\nhome may not, including being more energy eﬃcient and decreasing the cost of keeping that home\ncomfortable.\n\n2\n\n\fBut, again, these sales cannot fully make up for the overall slowdown in one of the economy’s most\nimpac�ul sectors.\nNow, I’m not going to stand here and provide a lecture on things you all know. And I am not going to\nminimize the work we’ve done to get inﬂa�on moving back toward target. What I want to provide you\nwith this morning is where I see things moving forward.\nTo start, I remain in the place where I have found myself for the past several months: Absent a stark turn\nin what I see in the data and hear from contacts, and audiences like you, I believe that we are at the\npoint where we can hold rates where they are.\nA�er our last policy rate hike in July, I went on the record with my view that, if economic and ﬁnancial\ncondi�ons evolve roughly as I expect, we can hold rates where they are. And, so far, economic and\nﬁnancial condi�ons are evolving as I expected, perhaps even a tad beter.\nDisinﬂa�on is under way, labor markets are coming into beter balance, and economic ac�vity continues\nto be resilient.\nLooking back, we did a lot, and we did it very fast. In fact, I heard that summa�on from some of your\npeers throughout the summer. In barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by more than 5\npercentage points and to its highest level in more than two decades. We also turned around our balance\nsheet policy, and we turned it around fast.\nThe workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some �me for the full impact of the\nhigher rates to be fully absorbed. What I have heard this summer is an appeal to give you and your\ncustomers the thing you wanted most: �me to catch your breath.\nBut my argument is that by doing nothing, we are doing something. And I think we are doing quite a lot.\nLook where we are — headline PCE inﬂa�on remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year,\nbut it is down 3 percentage points from this �me last year.\n\n3\n\n\fAbout half of that drop is due to the vola�le components of energy and food, so despite both of these\nbeing basic necessi�es of life, economists typically exclude them in the so-called core inﬂa�on rate,\nwhich gives a more accurate assessment of the pace of disinﬂa�on and its likely path forward.\nBut even that core measure of PCE inﬂa�on has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August\nmonthly reading was its smallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\nAnd again, I’m telling you something you already know, the rate of inﬂa�on in housing prices is similarly\ndown from its peak levels.\nI do see a steady disinﬂa�on under way, and I expect it to con�nue, with inﬂa�on dropping below 3\npercent in 2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent target therea�er.\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinﬂa�on. For example, September’s CPI\nreport came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing.\nLet me be clear about two things. First, I will not tolerate a reaccelera�on in prices. But second, I do not\nwant to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices.\nAnd for all the fancy techniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data\nover several months. Of course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn,\ndemands that, yes, we remain data dependent but pa�ent and cau�ous with the data.\nAs long as policy rates are restric�ve, we will keep steadily pressing down on inﬂa�on and bringing\nmarkets into beter balance.\nAnd the policy rate has outside factors that are working in parallel to further push down on inﬂa�on. For\nexample, while we are now six months past the spring banking turmoil, the �ghter credit condi�ons that\nhave existed since then are having the impact of higher interest rates without requiring them to be so.\n\n4\n\n\fAddi�onally, the current turmoil in labor markets is likely to similarly exert downward pressure on the\neconomy — not just in the loss of overall economic ac�vity but in the immediate impact on consumer\nspending as striking auto workers, for example, are forgoing their usual wages.\nOn top of this, we can also add the resump�on of student loan payments. Again, we do not yet know\nwhat impact this will have on consumer spending and savings, but I do expect it to be impac�ul, if not\nsigniﬁcant.\nSo, it is against this backdrop that I believe the prudent posi�on to be in is one in which the policy rate\ncan remain steady. Alas, you may have no�ced that I didn’t tell you how long rates will need to stay high.\nUnfortunately, I simply cannot tell you at this moment. My forecasts are based on what I know as of\n10:30 a.m. on Monday, October 16, 2023.\nAs �me goes by, as adjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on the\nunderlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them my �me frames. But, as for future\npolicy, I can tell you I do subscribe to the moniker, “higher for longer.” I didn’t coin the phrase, but my\nexpecta�on is that rates will need to stay high for a while.\nIt is not just the data that will signal to me when the �me comes to adjust policy either way, but what I\nalso hear from contacts and through outreach.\nA�er all, my discussions over the summer helped lead me to my current posi�on. And while I really do\nnot expect it, if inﬂa�on were to rebound, I know I would not hesitate to support further rate increases\nas our objec�ve to return inﬂa�on to target is, simply, not nego�able.\nMeanwhile, I con�nue to see strong underpinnings for our economy overall. This economy is proving to\nbe nothing if not resilient. I expect this to con�nue.\nGDP growth is outperforming es�mates from earlier this year. I do expect GDP gains to con�nue through\nthe end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But do not conﬂate a more moderate rate of GDP\ngrowth as a contrac�on. Put simply: I do not an�cipate a recession.\n5\n\n\fOf course, to aﬀord a home, a family needs a job to provide the means through which to purchase it. I\ncon�nue to an�cipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — just slightly above where we\nare now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak around 4.5 percent before heading back\ntoward 4 percent in 2025.\nThis path would put the unemployment ﬁgure in line with the natural rate of unemployment, or that\ntheore�cal level where labor market condi�ons support stable 2 percent inﬂa�on.\nNow, let me be clear about one thing: This does not mean that I expect mass layoﬀs.\nThere are many factors that play into the calcula�on of the unemployment rate itself. For instance, we’ve\nhad recent months in which, even as the economy added more jobs, the unemployment rate increased\nbecause more workers moved oﬀ the sidelines and back into the labor force.\nI also have to balance the so� data. For example, I have heard from employers — both directly and\nthrough contacts — that given how hard they’ve worked to ﬁnd the workers they currently have, they\nare doing all they can to hold onto them.\nThen there are also factors that have a very persistent impact on the underlying dynamics of the\neconomy and the labor market — technological change, immigra�on, child care all can shape or reshape\nlabor markets. And some or all of these factors can be at play simultaneously.\nThe amount of upheaval we’ve felt in our economy in a rela�vely short period of �me may lead some to\nbelieve that there are fundamental changes taking place. I would argue that’s only natural, given what\nwe’ve all been through since March 2020.\nThe pandemic was such a large health and economic crisis that it marks a “before” and an “a�er” in our\nminds and lives, not the least of which was the tremendous loss of life that touched so many of us very\nclosely. I cannot blame anyone who says that the new normal s�ll does not feel normal.\n\n6\n\n\fBut let me conclude by posing the following rhetorical ques�on: What in the economy has\nfundamentally changed from, say, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, inﬂa�on averaged 2 percent almost to the\ndecimal point and was actually below target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both\nyears and was as low as 3.5 percent, while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent.\nNow, I’m not saying that we’re going to be able to exactly replicate prepandemic economic condi�ons.\nBut the resilience of this economy is making me rethink some of the classic models.\nI have been wrong before, and this economy is challenging us with its willingness to do what the\nmodels say it should not and cannot be able to do. But, as they say, every challenge comes with\nopportunity.\nOpportunity to look at the data in diﬀerent ways.

Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Oﬃcer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning, everyone.\nFirst, to President Mike Quaranta and the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, thank you for invi�ng\nme for what has become our annual opportunity to be together — even if just virtually.\nAnd, to each of you with us, thanks for allowing me to be part of your Friday.\nI know we have a lot of ground to cover and only an hour in which to do it. And as much as I enjoy\nproviding you with my outlook, I much more enjoy the ability to drill deeper into issues through a\nconversa�on. So, let’s just get right into this.\nOf course, I must begin with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do\nnot necessarily reﬂect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nOr, as I’ve become fond of saying, when you’re telling your colleagues about this morning’s conversa�on,\nyou can just say, “Pat said,” not “the Fed said.”\nNow, as you can imagine, the two topics I get asked about most are interest rates and inﬂa�on. And that\nmakes sense, given the impact they have on the decisions made by both businesses and families. So, I’ll\nstart there.\n1\n\n\fA�er the last policy rate hike in July, I went on the record with my view that, if economic and ﬁnancial\ncondi�ons evolved roughly as I expected, we could hold rates where they are. And while I have been\nproven wrong in less than two months before, I am happy to say that so far economic and ﬁnancial\ncondi�ons are evolving as I expected, if not perhaps even a tad beter.\nDisinﬂa�on is under way. Economic ac�vity has been resilient. Labor markets are coming into beter\nbalance. Moreover, these condi�ons aren’t just where I see the na�onal economy but also our regional\neconomy and, speciﬁcally for today’s discussion, Delaware’s. And I’ll note those points in turn.\nSo, I remain today where I ﬁrst announced myself in early August: Absent a stark turn in what I see in the\ndata and hear from contacts, both in one-on-one conversa�ons and in forums like this, I believe that we\nare at the point where we can hold rates where they are.\nLook, we did a lot, and we did it very fast. In barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by\nmore than 5 percentage points and to its highest level in more than two decades — 11 rate hikes in a\nspan of 12 mee�ngs prior to September.\nWe also turned around our balance sheet policy, and we turned it around fast — and we con�nue to\n�ghten ﬁnancial condi�ons by shrinking the balance sheet.\nBut the workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some �me for the full impact of the\nhigher rates to be felt. Holding rates steady will let monetary policy do its work. I am sure policy rates are\nrestric�ve, and as long they remain so, we will steadily press down on inﬂa�on and bring markets into a\nbeter balance.\nBy doing nothing, we are s�ll doing something. And, actually, we are doing quite a lot.\nWe are also giving ourselves a chance to navigate some of the current uncertainty — labor strikes, oil\nprices, and the not-fully-exorcised specter of a government shutdown included.\n\n2\n\n\fI am more and more conﬁdent that not only is monetary policy currently working, but it will con�nue to\nwork. Headline PCE inﬂa�on remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year, but it is down 3\npercentage points from this �me last year. About half of that drop is due to the vola�le components of\nenergy and food. So, despite both of those being basic necessi�es of life, economists typically exclude\nthem in the so-called core inﬂa�on rate, which gives a more accurate assessment of the pace of\ndisinﬂa�on and its likely path forward.\nWell, core PCE inﬂa�on has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August monthly reading was its\nsmallest month-over-month increase since 2020. So, yes, I do see a steady disinﬂa�on under way, and I\nexpect it to con�nue, with inﬂa�on dropping below 3 percent in 2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent\ntarget therea�er.\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinﬂa�on. For example, yesterday’s release\nof September’s CPI report came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing. Let me be\nclear about two things. First, we will not tolerate a reaccelera�on in prices. But second, I do not want to\noverreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices. And for all the fancy techniques, the best\nway to separate a signal from noise remains to average data over several months. Of course, to do so,\nyou need several months of data to start with, which, in turn, demands that, yes, we remain data\ndependent but pa�ent and cau�ous with the data.\nMeanwhile, I con�nue to see GDP growth that is outperforming es�mates from earlier this year. This\neconomy is proving to be nothing if not resilient. I do expect GDP gains to con�nue through the end of\n2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But even as I foresee the rate of GDP growth modera�ng, I do\nnot see it contrac�ng. I do not an�cipate a recession.\nIn Delaware, the signals point in the same forward direc�on. And, in fact, business forma�on in\nDelaware, including for high-propensity businesses, remains strong, having risen con�nually since the\npandemic.\nDelaware’s Coincident Index, the Philadelphia Fed’s summary metric of economic ac�vity, increased 3.3\npercent year over year according to August data, reﬂec�ng generally posi�ve condi�ons. And, in fact,\nDelaware’s three-month increase of 0.6 percent matched the na�onal rate of increase. In the\n3\n\n\fPhiladelphia Fed’s most recent business outlook surveys, which survey manufacturing and\nnonmanufacturing ﬁrms in the Third District, including Delaware, ﬁrms overall reported declines in the\ncurrent month, but their six-month outlooks are op�mis�c for growth.\nRecognizing the importance of tourism to Delaware, I do note that the number of summer overnight\ntourist stays captured by the Rehoboth Beach–Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce showed\naccommoda�on room counts down from last year’s high levels between Memorial Day through Labor\nDay. However, we know there is probably much inﬂuencing these numbers beyond inﬂa�on or other\neconomic factors, including the weather.\nAll this aside, I fully recognize and appreciate these challenges that monetary policy is presen�ng to you\nand your businesses.\nThere are outside factors — factors that bring uncertainty with them — which con�nue to parallel the\nmore restric�ve stance we have pursued through the FOMC. For example, while we are now six months\npast the spring banking turmoil, the impact of that episode on credit markets is s�ll being felt; this is not\nnew to many of you.\nOur contacts throughout the banking sector con�nue to report �ghter credit condi�ons, which\nessen�ally have the impact of higher rates without requiring them to be so.\nAs I have spoken with contacts throughout the Third District this summer, I have heard from across\nindustry sectors of the challenges presented by both rates and current condi�ons in access to capital —\nfrom banking, to retail, to agriculture and manufacturing, and everyone in between.\nI know the impact the current climate is also having in the residen�al real estate sector, as higher\nmortgage rates have constricted inventory, which has, in turn, led to increasing prices and a shallowing\nof the pool of prospec�ve buyers, not just in Delaware but throughout the region and na�on.\nIn consumer ﬁnance, which I know is a par�cularly important sector for Delaware, there is data we\nfollow closely. So, we do take note that while the number of open bankcard accounts is up nearly 6\n\n4\n\n\fpercent, year over year, the rate of growth in origina�ons is down during that same �me span through\nJune, according to the latest available data.\nAnd we do pay aten�on to the fact that outstanding balances are up more than 15 percent year over\nyear as of August, while more consumers are pushing their payments forward, as evidenced by both the\nnearly 6 percent increase in the number of outstanding accounts and the increase in delinquency rates.\nAnd in Delaware, the 30-day delinquency rate in mortgages has been trending upward and now exceeds\nprepandemic levels — 2.4 percent of ac�ve loans today versus 2.2 percent in February 2020.\nAddi�onally, the current turmoil in labor markets is likely to similarly exert downward pressure on\nac�vity. I would say this is perhaps most notable among the auto worker strike, given the enormous\nimpact of that industry on our overall economy. It’s an industry that isn’t composed of just the direct\nmanufacturing of cars and trucks but also the business lines of countless downstream component\nmanufacturers and suppliers.\nThere is also the immediate impact of the strike on consumer spending and economic ac�vity, as striking\nworkers are forgoing their usual wages.\nIt is obviously too soon to tell the overall impact of this strike, as well as the ongoing labor ac�on in the\nentertainment industry and elsewhere, on GDP or inﬂa�on, but I suspect it will become obvious in the\ncoming months’ worth of data.\nAnd while an agreement was reached to temporarily keep the federal government open and running, we\ndon’t know what will happen four weeks from now when this agreement expires.\nFinally, I also believe this month’s restart of student loan payments will have a further dampening eﬀect\non consumer spending. How much so, however, remains to be seen.\nTurning to the jobs picture, I do an�cipate na�onal unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent —\njust slightly above where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak around 4.5\npercent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. That is a rate in line with what economists call\n5\n\n\fthe natural rate of unemployment, or the theore�cal level where labor market condi�ons support stable\ninﬂa�on of 2 percent.\nNow, before you all post “Pat says unemployment is going up” on your social media feeds, let me be\nclear about one thing: This does not mean that I expect mass layoﬀs.\nThere are many factors that play into the calcula�on of the unemployment rate itself. For instance, we’ve\nhad recent months where, even as the economy added more jobs, the unemployment rate increased\nbecause more workers moved oﬀ the sidelines and back into the labor force.\nAnd, beyond the hard data, I also have to balance the so� data. For example, employers throughout the\nThird District have told me that given how hard it has been to ﬁnd the workers they currently have, they\nare doing all they can to keep them.\nFor Delaware, the jobs picture remains consistent: Three straight months of labor force and household\njob gains have brought the state’s unemployment rate closer to that of the na�on than at any point in\nthe prior two years. Jobs numbers in major sectors, including construc�on, ﬁnance, and professional\nservices, are all above where they were in February 2020.\nI would also speciﬁcally note the nearly 9 percent year-over-year increase in jobs in the leisure and\nhospitality sector is back to around prepandemic levels.\nSurely, the pandemic was such a large health and economic crisis that it marks a “before” and “a�er” in\nour minds and lives, not the least of which was the tremendous loss of life that touched so many of us\nvery closely. It was a shock, in every sense of the word. To so many, the new normal s�ll does not feel\nnormal. Again, the pandemic is likely to be a deﬁning event for the genera�ons that experienced it. This\nis true for families and businesses.\nBut, having said that, allow me to pose the following ﬁnal thought: What has fundamentally changed in\nthe economy from, say, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, inﬂa�on averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point\nand was actually below target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was\nas low as 3.5 percent na�onwide and in Delaware, while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent. From the\n6\n\n\fcold lens of economics, I do not see the fundamental changes that would call for large changes in natural\nrates.\nBut I could also be wrong, and, trust me, that would not be the ﬁrst �me this economy has made me\nrethink some of the classic models. We just won’t know for sure un�l we have more data to look at over\n�me.\nSo, it is against this broad backdrop that I believe the prudent posi�on is one in which the policy rate can\nremain steady. Alas, you may have no�ced that I didn’t tell you how long rates will need to stay high.\nAnd, my apologies, I simply cannot tell you at this moment. My forecasts are based on what we know as\nof late 2023. As �me goes by, as adjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on\nthe underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them my �me frames.\nI can tell you three things on my views on future policy. First, I do subscribe to the new moniker, “higher\nfor longer.” I didn’t coin it, but my expecta�on is that rates will need to stay high for a while.\nSecond, the data and what I hear from contacts and outreach, will signal to me when the �me comes to\nadjust policy either way. I really do not expect it, but if inﬂa�on were to rebound, I know I would have\nno hesitancy to support further rate increases as our objec�ve to return inﬂa�on to target is, simply,\nnot nego�able.\nThird, I believe that a resolute, but pa�ent, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the so\nlanding that we all wish for our economy.\nAnd I think that is a good place for me to land my remarks, so we can get to have a conversa�on.\nMike, thanks for allowing me the �me, and let’s start our Q&A.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fFintech: Ask “What Next?” Not “What If?”\nThe Seventh Annual Fintech Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual/in-person)\nSeptember 7, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to this latest installment of what is quickly becoming not just\none of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s premier conferences but one of the premier\nconferences on fintech, period.\nEven though this one is a home game for me, so to speak, I still must preface my remarks with the\nstandard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr, as I like to put it, when you are recounting my remarks, just say, “Pat said.” Don’t say, “the Fed\nsaid.”\nWe have a full house here at the Philadelphia Fed, and more than 1,000 others joining us virtually. While\nthis is only slightly fewer people than Taylor Swift and Beyoncé drew to Philadelphia, it is an incredible\nnumber that speaks to much more than the expanding interest in fintech but also to the efforts of those\nwho put this conference together.\nAnd with that, I must give my thanks to Julapa Jagtiani who leads this effort. She is so much more than\njust a terrific introductory speaker. Julapa truly is the heart of this conference and a valuable source of\ninformation and contacts on a wide range of fintech topics, concerns, and approaches.\nI also wish to thank our panelists and speakers, several of whom I am proud to call my colleagues within\nthe Federal Reserve System, along with all the organizing partners of this year’s conference. This truly is\na strong team.\n1\n\n\fAnd, of course, my thanks to each of you for joining us, whether in person or online.\nNow, this is a conference to which I always look forward to attending. After all, by education, I’m an\nengineer even more than I am an economist. So, any forum that stands at the nexus of these two\ndisciplines is enough to pique my interest.\nAs an economist, and especially as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed, my goal is to ensure a\nstable economy that provides opportunities for everyone to grow and succeed. As an engineer, and\nspecifically as a civil engineer, my goal is to ensure a safe, reliable, and stable infrastructure, which\nprovides opportunities for all communities to grow and succeed.\nAnd I am far from the first person to recognize this important interdisciplinary connection. In 1917, the\nthen-director of the College of Engineering at Northwestern University, John F. Hayford, wrote an essay\nin the Journal of Political Economy titled, fittingly enough, “The Relation of Engineering to Economics,”\nwhich contains the following:\nEconomics and engineering are closely related. Economics has been defined as the\nsocial science of earning a living. With the same appropriateness, engineering may be\ndefined to be physical science applied to helping groups … to make a better living. 1\nIf you drill down below the surface of this statement, it becomes clear that both economists and\nengineers are looking for ways to make systems stronger, more equitable, and more efficient. And we\ncan see throughout history the advances in civil engineering which brought about both economic and\nsocietal advances.\nWe can chart the progress from the days of siting cities within sheltered harbors or along navigable\nrivers and lakes, to the digging of canals and the laying of railroad tracks, which allowed for the siting of\nnew cities; to the advent of the automobile and the airplane, which drastically shrunk distances; to the\n\n1\n\nHayford, John F. “The Relation of Engineering to Economics,” Journal of Political Economy 25:1 (1917).\n\n2\n\n\fcreation of the microchip, which enabled the birth of the Internet and e-commerce; and, yes, fintech,\nwhich render one’s location almost meaningless.\nWell, the same progress can be charted through our understanding and conceptualization of\nmoney. The barter system limited transactions to those in which two parties could come to agreement\n— I happen to have what you want at the moment you have what I want. The advent of cash, from\ncowry shells to paper notes, meant that anyone who held those commodities would be in equal\nstanding with the next person holding the same, making markets run more efficiently and fairly.\nBut now our concept of money is changing. We no longer need to hold actual notes when electronic\nbank statements tell us how much is in our accounts and any number of instant payment apps on our\nsmartphones allow us to move virtual money to practically anyone in any corner of the world, again,\nrendering our locations practically meaningless.\nYet, we still call a transaction made through code merely representing paper notes a cash transaction.\nLikewise, our e-wallets hold “credit cards” that aren’t cards at all, just graphical representations. And the\ndevelopment of cryptocurrencies and stablecoin is forcing us to further rethink our relationship with,\nand the nature and future of, cash.\nThese changes come in some ways for the better, and in some that should raise concerns. Everyone\nhere recognizes that fintech presents not just opportunities but also challenges, and that we will not\nultimately succeed if we only focus on the former and ignore the latter.\nSo, how do we view these innovations? How do we ensure adequate understanding of their risks and\nbenefits? And how should public policy and regulation address these as they pose both benefits and\nrisks to consumers and the economy at large?\nThese are just a few of the questions swirling around the topic of fintech, which bring us to today and\nthis conference.\n\n3\n\n\fBut the biggest question of all is not “what if” but “what next”? This is the big question that will be in\nthe background of every conversation over these two days. And my hope is that these conversations will\nkeep us moving toward the answer.\nWe are witnessing a technological revolution through AI, which holds tremendous promise for\nincreasing productivity and allowing for more decisions to be made in real time.\nAs an increasing number of institutions turn to AI-powered chatbots, the need for us to continue finetuning and securing this technology only increases. A recent story 2 in the New York Times highlighted a\nLas Vegas conference at which white-hat hackers were asked to help uncover vulnerabilities in the\nsafeguards of AI chatbots. And many found ways to trick these chatbots into making misleading,\nunethical, and potentially dangerous statements.\nIt’s not hard to move from this situation to one of malicious hackers exposing security flaws to exploit\nunsuspecting customers at a financial institution into giving up sensitive identifying information. This is\nan instance where our ability to keep focused on what may be next will also ensure consumer\nconfidence.\nAnd we at the Federal Reserve, both here in Philadelphia and System-wide, are going to remain focused\non doing our part. For example, July saw the rollout of the new FedNow instant payment service\nplatform. With FedNow, we will have a more nimble and responsive banking system. Within the Third\nDistrict, we continue working with our banking partners to encourage their participation.\nCertainly, the Federal Reserve is not first past the post in creating an instant payment system — other\nsystems, whether operated by individual banks or through third parties, have been operational for some\ntime. But by allowing banks to interact with each other to ensure one customer’s payment quickly and\nefficiently becomes another’s deposit, the Federal Reserve is fulfilling its role to provide a fair and\nequitable payment system.\n\nSarah Kessler and Tiffany Hsu, “When Hackers Descended to Test A.I., They Found Flaws Aplenty,” New York\nTimes, August 16, 2023.\n2\n\n4\n\n\fAnother area where the Fed is providing thought leadership is in quantum computing, or QC. And I am\nespecially proud that this System-wide effort is being led from right here at the Philadelphia Fed.\nQuantum computing has the potential to revolutionize security and problem-solving methodologies\nthroughout the banking and financial services industry. Right now, individual institutions and other\ncentral banks globally are expanding their own research into QC. And just as these institutions look to\nthe Fed for economic leadership, so, too, are they looking to us for technological leadership.\nQC holds tremendous promise for expanding capabilities far beyond those that our current systems\nallow. But we also know QC could allow for nefarious actors to pose a truly global cybersecurity threat\n— such as by hacking encryption algorithms. And while there is noted progress in quantum-resilient\nencryption, as a banking regulator, ever-present technological change means we cannot take our eyes\noff the ball.\nThese examples are why the Fed will also continue its efforts to provide leadership in the areas of\nfinancial literacy and education — including the publications and materials we have made available for\neducators to take into their classrooms — to give consumers the tools they will need to navigate these\nnew waters, make smart decisions, and protect their own futures.\nThankfully, we are not alone in any of these efforts. Throughout the financial system are numerous\npartners — public and private sector alike, inside this room and watching online — who understand the\nimportance of making sure we get the correct answer to the question, “what next?”\nAnd, as it just so happens, one of these partners is the subject of our first Fireside Chat — Rohit Chopra,\ndirector of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\nThroughout his tenure leading the CFPB, and before it as a member of the Federal Trade Commission,\nDirector Chopra has focused on issues of fraud prevention and economic and financial fairness.\nI am also honored to welcome him as he happens to be an alum of the Wharton School of the University\nof Pennsylvania, which is not only one of our conference’s organizing partners, but where I also hung my\nhat as dean for many years in my prior life in academia.\n5\n\n\fAnd leading the discussion will be the director of the Digital Assets Policy Project at Harvard University’s\nKennedy School of Government, Tim Massad.\nIn addition to authoring numerous articles on crypto and financial regulation, Tim served as chairman of\nthe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission — a tenure that brought him front and center with\nnumerous fintech issues — and as assistant secretary for Financial Stability at the United States\nTreasury.\nWith that, it’s time to get this seventh Fintech Conference formally started.\nSo, what next?\nWell, at this microphone, it’s the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThank you very much, Tameshia, for leading that enlightening discussion, and thank you to Rebecca,\nDavid, and Johnny for sharing your stories and insights.\nAnd, of course, thank you to Fed Communities and my colleagues from throughout the System —\nincluding Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who we heard from earlier — for their partnership in the\n\nWorker Voices Project.\nTo be sure, we’re at a watershed moment in our economy. I’m not just talking about the fight against\ninflation, in which we’re making progress.\nIt is a watershed moment in the labor market as well, especially for those of us who look at data and try\nto interpret their meaning. But numbers have two inherent problems. First, the numbers we get are\nalways backward looking, a snapshot from an earlier time. Second, the numbers blur the faces and\nvoices of those they seek to capture; they can only tell us so much.\nThis is where discussions like this and, more specifically, efforts like the Worker Voices Project are so\nessential. For our economy at this moment, it is important for those of us who hold a responsibility for\npromoting full employment and fostering economic opportunity to know, in real time, why workers are\nmaking the decisions they are, especially workers either employed in low-wage positions or who do not\nhave a college degree.\n\n1\n\n\fAnd I also would suggest there are important messages that employers would be wise to heed\nconcerning the kind of workplace they may need to create to attract the workforce they will need to be\nsuccessful.\nBy education, I’m a civil engineer, even more than an economist. If you know anything about civil\nengineers, we’re always looking for ways to make things stronger, better, and more resilient. For me,\nthis includes our economy.\nAs we have heard from today’s discussion, the factors going into the decisions made by workers of\nwhere to work, when to work, or whether to leave the work they have previously known to blaze an\nentirely new path — like David has — are increasingly complex. And we oversimplify these complexities\nat our own peril, whether as policymakers or employers.\nCertainly, the pandemic did not create these complexities. As long as there has been work, workers have\nmade decisions about their place and role in the economy, based on a number of factors. And workers\ntoday have more choices before them. The pandemic served as a breaking point for all of these stresses\n— at few other times in history have so many seemingly come to the same conclusions about their own\nfuture in the workforce.\nThey want to be treated with respect and dignity.\nThey want to the opportunity to gain new skills that will provide them with upward mobility.\nThey don’t want a job that doesn’t just get them through the day, but the opportunity to create a\nsatisfying and high-quality career.\nThey want managers who recognize that they, like them, have families and dreams outside of work and\nstrive to ensure an appropriate work–life balance.\nThe expectation of workers is that they will be treated as individuals. And this is especially true for\nworkers in jobs at the lower ranges of the wage scale or those without degrees. Jobs are not one-size-\n\n2\n\n\ffits-all, and neither are workers. Hiring processes may be more automated, but no worker wants to be\ntreated like an automaton.\nAnd the Worker Voices Project is providing the data that put this reality into greater focus and\nperspective.\nAs a result, many of us who have studied economics are having to rethink some of the premises we had\npreviously relied upon. But that’s probably a good thing. Despite what many of us were taught in Econ\n101, the study of economics is not all straight lines and straightforward conclusions. Sometimes the\neconomy, and those contributing to it, not only bend long-established rules but contribute to the\ncreation of new ones in the process.\nWe appear to be at that kind of moment now, and the research in the Worker Voices Project is\ncontributing to this new way of thinking. Which is good, because if one thing is now crystal clear, it is\nthat workers no longer want to be treated merely as a plot point on a graph.\nFor us as policymakers, the soft data provided by Worker Voices are equally important as, if not perhaps\neven more important than, numbers-driven hard data in getting a full understanding of our economic\nsituation.\nI am excited not just about this report, but for the research that is going to grow out of it. The more we\ncan bring the examples outlined in the Worker Voices report into our way of thinking, the better our\nchances of creating a strong, growing, and more inclusive American economy.\nSo, when I hear someone utter the apocryphal question, “Why doesn’t anyone want to work anymore?”\nmy response is to ask in return, “What are you doing in your workplace to make them want to work for\nyou?” and to point them to the Worker Voices Project.\nAgain, I thank our panelists and everyone who contributed to today’s webinar. And I thank all of you\nwatching for spending part of your afternoon with us.\nWhitney, I’ll now hand the program back to you.\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fOn the Flight Path to the Soft Landing\nPhiladelphia Business Journal’s State of the Economy\nPhiladelphia, PA\nAugust 8, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you, Sandy, for that welcome and introduction.\nMy thanks to the Philadelphia Business Journal for bringing us together, and I must give recognition in\nabsentia to Editor-in-Chief Ryan Sharrow for reaching out and inviting me to be with you.\nI also must give thanks to City Winery for hosting us this morning. I do note with some disappointment\nthat it is only 8:00 a.m., and we’re at a winery. I know while technically it may be 5:00 somewhere, this\nmay be a bit of a stretch.\nAnd I also thank you all for coming out this morning. It is always a pleasure to not only see so many\nfamiliar faces but also to get to know new ones.\nAnd no matter whether we are meeting today for the first time or just the latest of many, what excites\nme is that we’re all here for the same key reason. We care about Philadelphia. With its diversity of\npeoples and opportunities, Philadelphia remains an economic driver and leader.\nSo, I am happy to be here to give you my sense of where we are and where I see us heading, as well as\nto highlight a few things we have going on down Arch Street at the Philadelphia Fed, which you may find\nof interest.\nBefore I go any further, allow me to get a piece of business out of the way at the outset — and that’s the\nregular Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr, in simple English, you can always say, “Pat said.” You just can’t say, “the Fed said.”\nNow, this year I sit as a voting member of the FOMC. At our meeting two weeks ago, I joined my\ncolleagues on the Committee in voting to raise the policy rate another 25 basis points, to a range of\n5¼ to 5½ percent — the 11th policy rate increase in the span of 12 meetings.\n1\n\n\fBut you knew that. I bet what you want to know is what we are going to do next. Unfortunately, I do not\nknow — it depends on what the data will tell us from now to our next meeting in September.\nWhat I can tell you is where we stand now given past actions, what I expect to see in the data going\nforward, and whether I believe that we need to do more, or not.\nTen days ago, the latest PCE inflation report showed continued disinflation year over year on the\nheadline measure and promise on the core measure. We are making progress against inflation. It has\nbeen slow progress, and I am watchful of any reemerging price pressures. We remain unwavering in our\ncommitment to bring inflation back to target.\nAnd this is indeed what I expect will happen. I expect core PCE inflation to decline to a rate perhaps just\nbelow 4 percent year over year by the end of 2023, before falling below 3 percent next year and leveling\nout at our 2 percent target in 2025.\nWhile this economy may not be hewing to traditional modeling and seems to bend some rules in one\nplace and make up its own in another, it continues to move along. I forecast unemployment to tick up\nslightly and better align with the natural unemployment rate as labor tightness continues to ease. And\nwhen it comes to GDP, I expect the rate of growth to be slightly lower than what we have seen so far\nthis year.\nIn sum, I expect only a modest slowdown in economic activity to go along with a slow but sure\ndisinflation. In other words, I do see us on the flight path to the soft landing we all hope for and that has\nproved quite elusive in the past.\nNow that you know what I expect, I can tell you what I believe: Absent any alarming new data between\nnow and mid-September, I believe we may be at the point where we can be patient and hold rates\nsteady and let the monetary policy actions we have taken do their work.\nI take my role seriously in achieving the Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and maximum\nemployment. And I remain focused on seeing us achieve these goals to support our long-term economic\nsuccess.\nAllow me to be clear about one thing, however. Should we be at that point where we can hold steady,\nwe will need to be there for a while. The pandemic taught us to never say never, but I do not foresee\nany likely circumstance for an immediate easing of the policy rate.\nBefore the Committee meets again, we will have a slew of new economic data to consider, with another\nPCE report, one more employment report, and two CPI reports among them. And I will continue to talk\nand listen to people from throughout the Third District. Together, these will provide the guidance I will\nneed in considering my ultimate stance heading into September’s Committee meeting.\n2\n\n\fThis slew of data is not just national in scope. I also closely consider what I see going on right here in the\nPhiladelphia region. So, allow me to take a couple of minutes to share with you my more localized view.\nOverall, the area’s economy reflects weakened conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas\nsuch as housing, but maintains strengths, particularly in the labor market. While survey responses from\nboth manufacturing and nonmanufacturing businesses reflect currently weakened business activity\nacross the region, responses have moved positive for future expectations. Inflationary pressures in the\nregion have also waned somewhat though — as it is across the nation — inflation generally remains\nabove target and wage pressures remain elevated.\nThat’s the snapshot. But let’s look a little deeper.\nPennsylvania’s Coincident Index, the Philadelphia Fed’s summary metric of economic activity, increased\n1.4 percent in the second quarter and 0.6 percent from May to June, reflecting positive conditions.\nThere was a rise in payroll employment, the unemployment rate fell during the three-month period, and\nthere was an increase in average hours worked in manufacturing. Overall, year to year, the index has\nrisen 3.6 percent.\nAnother positive indicator is business formation, which in Pennsylvania continues well above\nprepandemic levels, with more than 12,500 business applications as of June 2023, compared with\nroughly 8,600 in February 2020, seasonally adjusted.\nOn the jobs front, the Philadelphia MSA has not only fully recovered its pandemic-era losses but is\ncurrently running 96,000 jobs above February 2020. Notably, this includes the hospitality sector, which\nis at full recovery.\nAnd, speaking of hospitality, we know that restaurants and hotels are good indicators of consumer\nspending and local economic health. One of the data sets we look at in the Philadelphia Fed is the trend\ndata for seated diners, which currently shows restaurant activity more than 4.5 percent above this time\nlast year.\nThe hotel sector, however, remains slightly below where it was prepandemic, despite Taylor Swift’s best\nefforts.\nWhen it comes to housing, Philadelphia Fed researchers also recently looked at current, real-time asking\nrents region-wide. Like many areas of the country over the past three years, Philadelphia experienced\nsignificant rent inflation, but the data now show that tapering off, as asking rents on average slightly\ndecreased 0.14 percent from April to May and basically have not changed across a three-month span.\nLooking at residential sales, current market tightness continues. As mortgage rates have risen, it is\nunderstandable that current homeowners don’t want to put their houses on the market and step away\nfrom their current low-rate mortgages, diminishing inventory. And, certainly, a lack of inventory keeps\n3\n\n\fprices elevated, which further impacts the depth of the potential buyer pool. Both are understandable\noutcomes.\nI am also very sensitive to the state of the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, especially here in Center\nCity. And I am glad that part of the discussion that will follow me will be specifically dedicated to CRE.\nFirst, I recognize the potential impact on financial institutions heavily invested in CRE, should they get\npressed into ownership in the event of a loan default. But on a more street level, I have concerns about\nthe health of the businesses traditionally supported by now-remote workers or those only in their\noffices intermittently, especially in the restaurant and services industries.\nAs the Philadelphia Business Journal itself reported just a few weeks ago, it will take many months,\nperhaps a couple of years, for the commercial real estate market to shake itself out and rightsize, given\nthe shifts in working environments. We will be watching this carefully, I assure you.\nLooking ahead, I am also focused, as many are, on the potential impact of the October 1 resumption of\nfederal student loan payments. Even with new income-based payment plans set to reduce payments for\nmany borrowers, our contacts have expressed concern about their capacity to reintegrate these\nborrowers into the repayment system.\nSo, how this system is implemented, and how prepared borrowers are and where their repayment funds\nwill come from — whether from paychecks or savings — will be something we will be keeping a close\neye on.\nAs we’ve been tracking, credit card balances and loan delinquency rates have both been increasing in\nrecent months. Coinciding with this has been a decrease in bank balances, as consumers have drawn\nmore from their savings to pay their bills, even if this drawdown is of pandemic-era supports they’ve\nheld on to. This is not the ideal consumer finance backdrop in which one would necessarily want to add\npotentially hundreds of dollars in new monthly student loan payments.\nBut, overall, I believe that the resilience we’ve seen in our economy will continue, and I do believe we\nare poised to come out from under the pressure of inflation in good condition, both nationally and right\nhere in Philadelphia and the region.\nBut what the economy on the other side will look like is not set in stone and is something that we at the\nPhiladelphia Fed are working hard to help decipher. So, please allow me a couple of minutes to highlight\ntwo ongoing initiatives: the Anchor Economy Initiative and the Worker Voices Project.\nThe Philadelphia Fed established the Anchor Economy Initiative to dive deep into the economic impacts\nthat hospitals and institutions of higher education have on their home regions. While it’s long been\nassumed that there’s been a positive benefit, we lacked the data to capture the economic impacts of\n“eds and meds.”\n4\n\n\fOver the course of a year, the team at the Philadelphia Fed pulled together data from all 524 regions of\nthe United States to create the Anchor Economy Dashboard, which measures the direct, indirect, and\ninduced economic impacts these institutions have on their communities.\nThe dashboard also includes a reliance index to indicate how dependent a region is on higher eds and\nhospitals for economic activity. With 1 as a baseline average, Philadelphia came in at an index of 1.4.\nWhile an increased reliance on eds and meds can be a concern in places where institutions are\nvulnerable from challenges in health care and declining college enrollments, in Philadelphia, our eds and\nmeds are more likely a strength. In fact, if you break down the data, these anchor institutions support\nnearly 496,000 jobs and nearly $34 billion in employment income and benefits up and down the chain.\nFurther, they add more than $51 billion to our regional GDP — roughly 11.4 percent of the region’s\ntotal. Moreover, each job created in the anchor economy has a multiplier effect of creating roughly one\nother job elsewhere in our area.\nUltimately, the power of having data is the power to make positive change in communities. The\ndashboard is a tool for communities to use in their economic development planning. For instance, St.\nLouis and Chicago are both using the regional data as context for some deeper dives they’re doing on\nimpacts at the neighborhood level. And, here in Philadelphia, I recently sat down with institutional\nleaders to begin discussions of how we may all be able to augment each other’s efforts.\nThe basic recognition is that each institution comes with its own sets of priorities, opportunities, and\nchallenges. But if we pull back the layers, we’ll find the points from which collective strengths can be\nleveraged and strong partnerships can emerge for an even larger impact.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative is just getting started, so there will be much more to report as time goes\non.\nThe Worker Voices Project is a more than year-long partnership between our colleagues at the Atlanta\nFed — and other Fed Banks — focused on meeting with and listening to workers in low-wage jobs and\nthose with a college degree to understand more fully what truly matters to them when deciding where,\nwhen, and whether to work, especially in this post-pandemic job market.\nI know we’ve all heard — and some have maybe even said — the phrase, “No one wants to work\nanymore.” But that’s an overly simplistic view. What we’ve learned is that there are a multitude of\nreasons why a worker may have exited the labor market at the onset of the pandemic only to reenter\nfrom an entirely different door on the other side of it or quit jobs at such a high rate.\nYes, workers want to be paid what they believe they are worth and bring to the table, but it’s not only\nabout wages. And, yes, they want to be somewhere they can be productive and contributing employees,\nbut not if they don’t believe their contributions are appreciated, let alone rewarded.\n5\n\n\fWhat we increasingly heard is that workers want something for which economists don’t yet have a\nmetric: to be treated with dignity.\nThe factors going into the decisions of where to work, or whether to go in an entirely different direction,\nare increasingly complex. And these complexities may make us rethink what we thought we knew about\nlabor markets.\nAllow me to provide two examples from earlier this summer, when I had the opportunity at the\nPhiladelphia Fed to engage with workers as part of the Worker Voices Project. One young woman, a\nsingle working mother, told me that she changed jobs because she needed a manager who understood\nhow last-minute schedule changes impacted her ability to find childcare. And we heard from a young\nman who left a job that required him to be on the road; yet, when diagnosed with a condition that left\nhim prone to severe seizures, his manager still wanted him spending his days driving, as opposed to\nsimilar work that could be done from a stationary location.\nAs one participant summed it up, “We’re looking for a place where we belong.”\nFor us as policymakers and employers, those words can point us in the direction for creating a strong,\ngrowing, and more inclusive economy.\nWhich, after all, is what we all want and is the reason why we’re all here today. We at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia are just as committed to the economic health of our region and our\nresidents as you are. And we remain at the ready with the data and insights necessary to help you make\nthe decisions that will lead to your success.\nWith all that said — and I know it’s a lot — I’d be happy to step back and take some questions.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fHighlighting the Labor Market’s New Complexities; Listening to Worker Voices\nNational Association for Business Economics (NABE)\nMonetary Policy and Outlook Webinar\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJune 1, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you in this series on monetary policy and our\neconomic outlook.\nAnd I thank NABE for the invite and Dr. Elaine Buckberg for moderating.\nYou heard from my colleague, Richmond Fed President and CEO Tom Barkin, on Tuesday, so I am\nhonored to provide a Fed bookend to this webinar.\nI look forward to having a useful and engaging dialogue. But please allow me to open with my thoughts\non the direction in which we are heading.\nAnd I must lead with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nWhile headline PCE inflation has come down from its peak of 7 percent last year, it is still running at over\n4 percent year over year — way above the Fed’s long-run target of 2 percent annually. Disinflation is\nunder way, but it is doing so at a disappointingly slow pace.\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for American families — cutting into purchasing\npower and household wealth. And the pain isn’t being felt equally.\n\n1\n\n\fThe toll is falling most heavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the elevated\ncosts of housing, food, and health care — life’s true necessities.\nTo combat this inflation, the Fed has been working to slow the economy modestly and bring demand\nmore in line with supply. We have increased the target range for the federal funds rate — our primary\nmonetary policy tool — by 500 basis points since March 2022. Ongoing balance sheet reduction is also\ntightening financial conditions.\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working; for example, house price indexes\nare cooling.\nAnd it is encouraging that even as we have raised rates, the national economy remains relatively healthy\noverall. Since January, we’ve experienced modest growth in economic activity.\nThere are also still a record number of Americans employed, with more than 1 million jobs created, on\nnet, so far this year. While there are some signs that labor market tightness is beginning to ease a bit,\nthe unemployment rate remains near record lows — 3.4 percent in April.\nWe’re also paying close attention to the banking system. The recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank,\nSignature Bank, and First Republic ignited an understandable wave of anxiety among banks, depositors,\nand investors. But I can assure you that the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient.\nWe know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can undermine confidence in healthy banks.\nThat’s why the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed acted quickly to protect the U.S. economy and its\nbanking interests. The Federal Reserve also led a thorough, transparent, and swift review of the events\nsurrounding Silicon Valley Bank so we could learn what went wrong.\nSo, of course, I know the question on everyone’s mind: OK, Pat, where do we go from here?\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate: to promote full employment and\nprice stability. On the jobs front, things look quite good; we are, effectively, at full employment. But\nwhen it comes to inflation, there is still significant room for improvement.\n2\n\n\fIt will take some time to evaluate how recent events may impact overall economic activity and inflation.\nI expect to see tighter credit conditions for households and businesses that may slow economic activity\nand hiring, but the full extent is still unclear.\nWhat is clear is that the Fed remains fully committed to return inflation to its 2 percent target. To do\nthis, the policy stance needs to be restrictive enough — but what is “enough” is not written in stone\nsomewhere.\nInstead, I am closely monitoring incoming data, listening to our contacts and audiences, and evaluating\neconomic conditions to assess whether additional tightening will be needed.\nI do believe that we are close to the point where we can hold rates in place and let monetary policy do\nits work to bring inflation back to the target in a timely manner.\nAlong this path, I project that we will see modest growth this year, with real GDP coming in a bit below 1\npercent.\nI expect inflation to decline to somewhere around 3.5 percent this year, before falling to 2.5 percent in\n2024, and leveling out at our 2 percent target in 2025. Unemployment is also likely to tick up slightly,\nhitting around 4.4 percent this year.\nBut this is just a snapshot of what conditions look like today. We’re operating in a very uncertain\nenvironment, and I will be closely monitoring our dashboards of economic indicators and assessing their\nimplications.\nNow, as I’ve said before, survey data are an important tool in the economic business. At the Fed, we\nlook at everything from big broad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures\nlike restaurant reservations and mobility data.\nThese data — hard data — tell us a lot. But even hard data have their limits. The numbers can point in a\ncertain direction, yet there may be a lot going on underneath those numbers, which is not as easily\nvisible but is just as vital to drawing a complete picture.\n3\n\n\fTake, for example, the employment picture.\nThroughout the past year, each interest rate hike was predictably followed by voices warning that we\nwere about to tank the labor market and spike unemployment. That hasn’t happened, but we monitor\nthese trends to see how workers will be impacted if it does.\nGiven the tight labor market, there’s obviously something deeper happening. We continually hear from\nsome employers that certain tools aren’t working as they once did. Simply offering higher wages still\nisn’t attracting the workers some need, and some efforts to increase the productivity of current workers\nis instead leading to increased turnover.\nThese cases are especially true at the lower end of the wage scale, and this may be why some have\ngroused that, “No one wants to work anymore.” But I think we all would agree there’s more going on\nunder the surface.\nNow, I’m not strictly an economist. I’m a civil engineer. And that background is what is forcing me to\nlook at this issue in a different way.\nAnd this is what we at the Philadelphia Fed are doing. And I’d like to spend a few moments on this\nbefore we get to our Q&A.\nOver the past year, our Community Development and Regional Outreach team, along with colleagues at\nthe Atlanta Fed and elsewhere, engaged with low-wage and non-degree-holding workers nationwide in\na series of focus group conversations.\nWe’ve been listening to them and to their reasons why they may have exited the labor market at the\nonset of the pandemic to reenter from an entirely different door on the other side of it or are quitting\njobs at such a high rate.\nWe’re calling this effort the Worker Voices Project. And we released our first report — “Shifting\nPerspectives and Expectations on Employment” — one week ago.\n4\n\n\fYes, workers want to be paid what they believe they are worth and bring to the table, but it’s not only\nabout wages. And, yes, they want to be somewhere they can be productive and contributing employees,\nbut not if they don’t believe their contributions are appreciated, let alone rewarded.\nWhat we increasingly heard is that workers want something that we, as economists and civil engineers,\ndon’t yet have a metric for: being treated with dignity.\nAs one participant told me recently, “Work is not the end-all, be-all.” Or, in the words of another,\n“We’re looking for a place where we belong.”\nThe factors going into the decisions of where to work, or whether to go in an entirely different direction,\nare increasingly complex. And these complexities may make us rethink what we thought we knew about\nlabor markets.\nI encourage everyone to take a look at our initial Worker Voices Project report.\nFor us as policymakers, soft data are perhaps equally important to get a full understanding of our\neconomic situation. And the soft data we’re getting through Worker Voices are what will help us chart a\ncourse for a strong and growing — but also a more inclusive — American economy.\nI know that’s a lot to start with, but I also know it’s what is going to lead us to a great conversation.\nAnd, Elaine, to that end, let’s get right to it.\n\n5\n\n\f"

First, I’ll talk about current economic\nconditions and how they are affecting the Fed’s monetary policy actions. Then, I’ll take a deep\ndive into the effects that monetary policy can have on the housing market and how these\nimpacts transmit through the economy. After that, I plan to leave plenty of time at the end for\nyour questions and comments.\nBut before I do any of that, I have to issue the standard disclaimer: The views I express tonight\nare my own and don’t necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe State of the Economy\nWith that out of the way … let’s talk about the state of the economy. In the wake of the\npandemic, one word has remained top of mind for the Federal Reserve: inflation.\n1\n\n\fWhile headline PCE inflation has come down from its peak of 7 percent last year, it is still\nrunning at 5 percent year over year — way above the Fed’s long-run target of 2 percent\nannually. Recent readings show that inflation is continuing to recede, but it’s doing so slowly.\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for Americans — cutting into purchasing\npower and household wealth. And the pain isn’t being felt equally. The toll is falling most\nheavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the elevated costs of\nshelter, food, and health care — life’s true necessities.\nTo combat this inflation, the Fed has been working to slow the economy modestly and bring it\nmore in line with supply. We have increased the target range for the federal funds rate — our\nprimary monetary policy tool — by 475 basis points since March 2022. Balance sheet reduction\nis another way to tighten conditions.\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working — for example, house\nprice indexes are cooling.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we have raised rates, the national economy remains\nrelatively healthy overall. Since January, we’ve experienced strong growth in economic activity.\nThere are also still a record number of Americans employed, with more than 1 million jobs\ncreated, on net, so far this year. While there are some signs that labor market tightness is\nbeginning to ease a bit, the unemployment rate remains near record lows — 3.5 percent in\nMarch.\nWe’re also paying close attention to the banking system. The recent failures of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank ignited an understandable wave of anxiety among banks, depositors,\nand investors. But I can assure you that the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient.\n\n2\n\n\fWe know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can undermine confidence in healthy\nbanks. That’s why the Treasury, FDIC, and the Fed acted quickly to protect the U.S. economy\nand its banking interests. The Federal Reserve is also leading a thorough, transparent, and swift\nreview of the events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank so that we can learn what went wrong.\nTaking all of this into account, here’s my outlook for what you should expect from the Federal\nReserve and the economy in the near term.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate: to promote full\nemployment and price stability. On the jobs front, things look quite good; we are, effectively, at\nfull employment. But when it comes to inflation, there is still significant room for improvement.\nIt will take some time to evaluate how recent events may impact overall economic activity and\ninflation. I expect to see tighter credit conditions for households and businesses that may slow\neconomic activity and hiring, but the full extent is still unclear.\nWhat is clear is that the Fed remains fully committed to its 2 percent inflation target. To achieve\nthat, I anticipate that some additional tightening may be needed to ensure policy is restrictive\nenough to support both pillars of our dual mandate. Once we reach that point, which should\nhappen this year, I expect that we will hold rates in place and let monetary policy do its work.\nAlong this path, I project that we will see modest growth this year, with real GDP coming in a bit\nbelow 1 percent. I expect inflation to continue declining, landing somewhere between 3\npercent and 3.5 percent this year, before falling to 2.5 percent in 2024, and leveling out at our 2\npercent target in 2025. Unemployment is also likely to tick up slightly, hitting around 4.4\npercent this year.\n\n3\n\n\fBut this is just a snapshot of what conditions look like today. We’re operating in a very\nuncertain environment, and I will be closely monitoring our dashboards of economic indicators\nand assessing their implications.\nThe Housing Channel\nI often get asked how the Fed measures the impact of its monetary policy decisions.\nUnfortunately, there’s no simple answer.\nMonetary policy has both immediate and lagging impacts, which affect sectors of the economy\nin different — and often interconnected — ways. To make better sense of it, economists sort\nthese impacts into “channels.”\nBut even within a channel, it can be difficult to get a clear picture of how monetary policy is\ntransmitting — something we can see by taking a closer look at one of our most studied and\nwell-known channels.\nAfter just about every FOMC meeting, you’ll see some version of the same headline pop up:\n“What does the Fed’s decision mean for home buyers?”\nSo, let’s focus our conversation there: on the housing channel. How do the Fed’s actions impact\nhome buyers?\nMortgage Rates\nAs you all know, the Fed doesn’t actually set mortgage rates. Our primary tool for conducting\nmonetary policy, as I mentioned, is the target range for the federal funds rate. But there is a\nclose relationship between this rate and the mortgage rates that are offered to consumers.\nFederal funds transactions are unsecured overnight loans, typically used by depository\ninstitutions to lend or borrow reserves. Of course, this isn’t how people finance home\n4\n\n\fpurchases. They take out mortgages that are collateralized and spread out over multiple years,\nif not decades.\nMortgage lenders take this into account when setting interest rates. They’re not only looking at\nwhat the federal funds rate is today, but what they expect it to be 10 or more years down the\nline. They’re also considering a whole host of broader macroeconomic factors.\nYet there is a clear and fast pass-through from the federal funds rate to mortgage rates. For\nexample, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage could be found for as low as 2.7 percent at the end of\n2020, when our policy rate was effectively at zero. In the last 12 months, that same 30-year\nfixed rate mortgage has climbed to nearly 7 percent, with policy rates now close to 5 percent.\nNow, you might think this means that home buyers are the first stakeholders within the\nhousing channel to be impacted by the Fed’s monetary policy actions. But when rates are\nfalling, there’s another group that can feel it even sooner — and there isn’t even a real estate\ntransaction involved.\nRefinancers\nMortgage refinancing is a big business — if interest rates are going down. In fact, when the\nFOMC cut the federal funds rate to zero in response to the pandemic, refinancing rose to a\nstaggering $2.6 trillion in 2020 and 2021 — more than double the prepandemic value.\nAs homeowners refinanced their mortgages into lower-interest loans, it freed up monthly\nincome, boosting household consumption and savings. This, in turn, helped the economy better\nweather the uncertainty caused by the pandemic — one of the FOMC’s objectives for cutting\nrates at the time.\nThe situation looks quite different today. When mortgage rates increase, there’s little incentive\nto refinance — and we see this show up in recent data. Refinancing fell to $66 billion in the last\n5\n\n\fquarter of 2022. Other instruments that let owners tap into their home equity, like home equity\nlines of credit, have become more expensive as well.\nIt’s also worth noting that refinancing is history dependent when it comes to the potential\nimpact of monetary policy. 1 What rates have been, and for how long, directly affect how much\nrefinancing will be triggered by accommodative monetary policy. With most mortgages today\nlocked in at very low rates, even bringing the federal funds rate all the way back to zero would\nbe unlikely to trigger much meaningful refinancing.\nHome Buyers and Sellers\nNow, let’s turn to our next group of stakeholders impacted by the Fed’s monetary policy\ndecisions: home buyers and sellers.\nHere, it’s time to state the obvious. A higher federal funds rate almost always leads to higher\nmortgage rates, which makes buying a house more expensive for prospective homeowners.\nHigher costs typically dampen demand on both sides of a potential transaction. Home buyers\nmay choose to wait for lower prices or lower rates to make a purchase. Homeowners,\nmeanwhile, may postpone selling to preserve a locked low-interest rate or wait for a higher\nprice. As home sales slow, house prices should eventually decrease, though this usually\nhappens with a lag.\nAfter a year of interest rate increases, we have started to see this process play out in the\ncurrent housing market. After sales of existing homes exceeded 6 million in 2021, we saw sales\nduring the last quarter of 2022 average 4 million at an annual rate. Sales of new homes were\nalso halved from their peak. Meanwhile, house prices have fallen each month since their peak\nin June, though they remain at similar levels to what we saw a year ago.\n\n6\n\n\fA drop in house prices can have notable effects within the broader economy. During the Great\nRecession, we saw a pronounced decrease in household consumption tied to declining home\nprices. More recent research has emphasized liquidity effects, which can play an important role\nin determining the strength and timing of monetary policy transmission in the housing channel.\nRonel Elul, from the Philadelphia Fed, and coauthors argue that once all credit constraints that\nhouseholds face are accounted for, there are negligible wealth effects.\nAs we look at the current situation, U.S. households have entered the tightening cycle with\nvery healthy balance sheets. Existing homeowners are also benefiting from low mortgage rates\nand elevated home equity. This gives a “cushion” for homeowners, making it unlikely that a\ncorrection in house prices would trigger widespread liquidity constraints and consumer\nspending reductions.\nIt’s also important to point out that there will never be a perfect relationship between interest\nrates and home-buying trends. The purchase of a home is often associated with other major life\nevents, like getting married. This means that a certain level of housing demand will always be\npresent, regardless of mortgage rates or house prices.\nRenters and Landlords\nThat brings us to our next group of stakeholders who will be most impacted by changes to\nmonetary policy: renters and landlords.\nThe rental market is where we start to see lags pile up as conflicting dynamics play out. As\npotential home buyers delay purchases because of higher rates, rental demand can increase,\nincentivizing landlords to raise rents. 2 But their ability to do so immediately can be limited by\nleasing terms that range anywhere from six to 24 months. Landlords may also hesitate to raise\nrents on existing tenants in good standing, who may balk at significant increases and leave units\nempty for months. Striking the right balance is a juggling act.\n\n7\n\n\fWhat’s the end result from a monetary policy perspective? A very protracted and muted effect\non renters — who, we can’t forget, make up about a third of total U.S. households.\nBuilders and Investors\nThe impacts only get fainter as we branch out beyond the rental market and into a world many\nof you know well: the supply side. Both builders and investors in the housing channel also\nrespond to monetary policy actions, but long project lead times mean the lags here are\nsubstantial. They’re also more likely to be closely interrelated with other channels, like the cost\nof goods.\nWhere are we today? Housing starts have been slowing down compared with a year ago, but\nthey remain well above their average levels since the Great Recession and prior to the\npandemic. Starts for multiunit structures, which have even longer building lags, have yet to\nabate.\nBack to the Dual Mandate\nUp to this point, we have explored how monetary policy impacts the housing market. But the\nFed’s dual mandate is maximum employment and price stability overall. So, the next question\nbecomes: How much does housing matter for total employment and aggregate inflation?\nFor employment, the answer is: not too much. Employment in construction represents just\nabout 5 percent of total nonfarm payrolls, and only a fraction works with residential buildings.\nLags here confound the picture quite a bit. While employment in construction is still growing\nslightly year over year, declining residential investment has subtracted more than 1 percentage\npoint of GDP growth in the second half of last year.\nBut when it comes to inflation, housing matters. Home prices and rents are also major drivers\nof inflation. Housing makes up about a third of the basket of goods used by the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics to calculate the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Yet, even as home prices have fallen,\n8\n\n\fshelter inflation has steadily increased. In fact, more than 60 percent of the increase in the\nmost recent core CPI can be attributed to rising shelter costs.\nStructural Factors\nNow, I have mainly talked about housing through the narrow lens of monetary policy. But I’d be\nremiss if I also didn’t touch on the structural factors impacting housing — most notably, the\nlack of affordable housing.\nSince the Great Recession, the U.S. hasn’t built enough housing to keep price growth in check.\nBy most estimates, we are now several million homes short of where we need to be. This is a\nprimary driver of shelter inflation, which, as we discussed, is one of the key reasons core\ninflation remains so high.\nGetting shelter inflation under control is an urgent priority. Monetary policy has a role to play\nhere in broadly fighting inflation, bringing down the costs of goods and services related to the\nhousing channel. But to fully address the scope and scale of this problem, we also need action\nfrom federal, state, and local governments.\nWhat could this look like? Some of the ideas I’ve seen mentioned include changing zoning laws,\nrevising tax codes, building workforce housing, and creating housing subsidies.\nAs a Fed president, I’m neutral on the merits of any specific policy; that’s for other policymakers\nto decide. But I’m not neutral on the need to do something.\nShelter inflation is a macroeconomic drag. Money spent on housing is money that’s not being\nspent on education, services, and durable goods.\nThere are also already signs that our most vibrant metro areas aren’t achieving their full\neconomic potential, because millions of would-be participants simply can’t afford to live there.\n9\n\n\fThis has major implications for our long-term economic growth, something we should all be\nconcerned about.\nThe Economy Is People\nAs you can see, the housing channel is incredibly complex and interconnected. And it’s only one\nof the many channels we look at to determine how monetary policy is transmitting through the\neconomy. It’s a reminder of why I have always approached this job with humility.\nThe economy isn’t the Federal Reserve, or interest rates, or numbers in a data report. The\neconomy is people — living and working and making the best decisions they can with the\ninformation they have.\nThe only way we can make sound monetary policy decisions is to carefully consider all these\ndifferent perspectives — not only in what the data tell us, but in what we hear from people\ndirectly. Because if we only looked at the economy from a 30,000-foot view, we’d miss a whole\nlot about what’s happening on the ground.\nIt’s also why I love coming to events like this one. While my remarks tonight were confined to\nmonetary policy and the residential home market, I’m eager to hear from all of you about what\nyou’re seeing in the commercial real estate space. You’re on the frontlines of the future of\nwork, the future of retail, and the future of our cities — the very factors that will drive the\nfuture of our economy. Any insights you’d like to share tonight would be well considered and\nmuch appreciated.\nWith that, let’s get to your questions and comments.\nEndnotes\nMartin Eichenbaum, Sergio Rebelo, and Arlene Wong, “State Dependent Effects of Monetary Policy: The\nRefinancing Channel,” American Economic Review 112(3) (March 2022), pp. 721–761.\n\n1\n\nDaniel Dias and João B.

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fOpening Remarks\nWharton Initiative on Financial Policy & Regulation\nPhiladelphia\nApril 11, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello, everyone. Thanks so much for having me. It’s great to be here with all of you, and I’m eager to get to\nour conversation.\nBut with the Federal Reserve in the news a lot lately, I wanted to take a few minutes at the top to frame\nour discussion. What can I say, it’s the former professor in me.\nLet me start with the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are my own, and they don’t\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nFirst, let me address the topic you’ve probably heard about the most recently: the failures of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank. One of the Fed’s most important jobs is supervising and regulating banks. So let\nme put your minds at ease: The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient.\nBut we’re not taking anything for granted. We know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can\nundermine confidence in healthy banks. That’s why the Federal Reserve is leading a thorough, transparent,\nand swift review of the events involving SVB so that we can learn from this experience.\nWith that being said, let’s talk a little about the Fed and its other important job: monetary policy. As many\nof you know, the Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, based in Washington, D.C., and\n12 regional banks around the country.\nEach regional bank has its own president and board of directors — a group of business, banking, and\ncommunity leaders who give us insight into the sectors and issues that make each region tick.\nMy District — the Third District — covers eastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, and all of Delaware. It’s the\nsmallest District geographically, but I like to think we punch above our weight.\nThe decentralized nature of the Fed is, in my mind, our greatest strength.\nWe’re tasked with making national policy in service of our dual mandate — full employment and price\nstability. But we serve an enormous country made up of vastly different economic realities. If we looked at\ndata only from a 30,000-foot view, we’d miss a whole lot about what’s happening on the ground.\nSo, what have we been learning about the state of the economy from all of our inputs?\nOn the employment side of the dual mandate, we see that job gains are strong, and the unemployment\nrate remains low — 3.5 percent nationally last month. We are, effectively, at full employment.\n\n\fBut on the inflation side, we see a lot of room for improvement. Headline PCE inflation has come down\nfrom its peak of 7 percent last year (year over year, June 2022) but is still running, year over year, at 5\npercent — way above our 2 percent target. And recent readings show that disinflation is proceeding slowly\n— which is disappointing, to say the least.\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for Americans — cutting into purchasing power and\nhousehold wealth. And, as is so often the case, the pain isn’t distributed equally. The toll is falling most\nheavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the rising costs of shelter, food, and\nhealth care — life’s true necessities.\nTo combat inflation, the Fed is working to slow the economy modestly and bring it more in line with\nsupply. To accomplish this, we have increased the federal funds rate — our primary monetary policy tool\n— by 475 basis points since March 2022. Balance sheet reduction is another way to tighten conditions.\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working — for example, house price indexes\nare cooling.\nSince the full impact of monetary policy actions can take as much as 18 months to work its way through\nthe economy, we will continue to look closely at available data to determine what, if any, additional\nactions we may need to take. But make no mistake: We are fully committed to bringing inflation back\ndown to our 2 percent target.\nBefore we get to our Q&A, I’ll leave you with one final thought.\nWith all the attention our interest rate decisions get every six weeks, it might seem like the Fed is the\nprimary force driving what happens in the economy. But that’s just not the case.\nThe Fed implements monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate for an economy made up of countless\nworkers, businesses, investors, and institutions. An economy that you are, and will continue to be, an\nimportant part of — especially with your Wharton education backing you up.\nAs you think about the opportunities that await you beyond this place, one of the most powerful things\nyou can do is be intentional about how you want to contribute to the economy.\nWhether you head to Wall Street, become an entrepreneur, or pursue a career in public service, you have\na tremendous opportunity to help shape the world around you. I hope you take advantage of it.\nWith that, let’s get to your questions.\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon! It’s great to return to this event. It was 2017 when I last spoke at this annual economic\noutlook. My topic back then focused on challenges in the economy. Here we are in 2023 — and there\nare still economic challenges to address — albeit very different ones from six years ago.\nThere are a few areas we’ll explore today. First, because I can’t resist donning my old teaching cap, I’d\nlike to offer some background about what the Fed is and what it does. I’ll also talk about what the Fed\ndoesn’t do, because sometimes the Fed’s powers are overestimated. I’ll then pivot to the economic\noutlook for our country and our region, and touch on my approach to monetary policy. After that, we\ncan get to some questions, which is something I always enjoy and look forward to.\nBut before we do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s start with some Fed history.\nFederal Reserve History and Structure\nThe First Bank of the United States was the brainchild of the man who in recent years has become\neverybody’s favorite founding father: Alexander Hamilton. The bank was located right here in\nPhiladelphia when it was still the capital of the country. It was established in 1791 to deal with the debt\nfrom the Revolutionary War and to ensure the government’s financial stability. It looked a lot different\nthan the entity we are today, and it wasn’t without controversy.\n\n1\n\n\fAs Broadway has reminded us, Thomas Jefferson was among those who worried about power that was\ntoo strong and too centralized. He even once famously said he found banks to be more dangerous than\nstanding armies. When the bank’s charter was up for renewal after its initial 20 years, the Jeffersonian\nargument won out and the measure failed by a vote each in the House and the Senate. The bank was\ndissolved.\nFive years later, Congress agreed to a central banking function a second time, and we launched the\nimaginatively named Second Bank of the United States. And about 20 years after that, Congress decided\nnot to renew the charter, again owing to a strain of popular sentiment that didn’t trust powerful,\ncentralized institutions.\nBut not having a central bank didn’t really work because it tended to breed volatility.\nThe period leading up to the third iteration of American central banking — the Federal Reserve — was\nmarked by currency instability, bank runs, and cycles of boom and bust. At one point, J.P. Morgan\nactually had to step in personally to bail out the country. If you’ve ever been to the Morgan Library &\nMuseum in New York, you can stand in the room where the solution to that financial crisis was worked\nout.\nEven during the Revolutionary War era, central banking was standard in democracies, and it remains\nthat way today. There are no developed economies that don’t have it in some form. So, the eventual\nadoption of our current central bank — in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act — was to some extent\ninevitable. And the configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a decentralized\nstructure — is something of a testament to old-fashioned American compromise. It also reflects the\nunique demands of the United States and our economy.\nThe Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, and 12 regional\nBanks located around the country, including the one I oversee here in Philadelphia.\nThe Board seats seven governors, including the Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and\nboard of directors, which is made up of business, banking, and community leaders from the area.\nFundamentally, this provides the Fed with a perspective, within each District, of the sectors and issues\nthat make the region tick. We are here in the Third District, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania,\n\n2\n\n\fSouth Jersey, and the state of Delaware. We’re the smallest District, geographically, but I like to think we\npunch above our weight.\nThe Fed’s decentralized nature is, in my view, a unique strength. We’re making national policy, but\nwe’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data can obscure realities on the\nground. Conditions can look very different in Philadelphia, Dover, or Trenton than they do in Dallas, Salt\nLake City, or Honolulu. This system gives, in my view, a voice to a range of localities and sectors. It also\nallows us to focus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because we’re such\na big country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China and India have larger\npopulations, and no other country has a bigger economy, at least for now. And that economy is vast,\nspreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that most other nations don’t.\nSo, it makes sense that we have a system that feeds back information from around the country.\nThe other difference from most central banks is that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a single\ngoal; that is, we’re charged with both maximum employment and price stability. Most just focus on one.\nMaximum employment encompasses a wide range of metrics, although most attention is paid to the\nunemployment rate. That number, of course, will never be zero. Instead, we try to ensure that labor\nmarkets are functioning dynamically and efficiently. Price stability, on the other hand, is low and stable\ninflation, which we judge to be around 2 percent a year. More on both topics in a bit.\nThe decisions we make within the Fed — the way we look at the economy and respond to data — are\nbuilt entirely on the foundation of our dual mandate. It is our North Star.\nNow that we’ve established that, I turn to the question so many people secretly want to ask: What,\nexactly, does the Fed do? I’m delighted to talk about it, but just as important, I’ll also mention what we\ndon’t do.\nWe have lending power. What that means is we do not have spending power. We have no authority\nover fiscal policy, which deals with debts, deficits, and taxes. Or investments to encourage growth. Or\n\n3\n\n\fgrants to worthy organizations. Or programs to spur job creation. Those all depend on elected officials,\nbe they on the local, state, or national level.\nSo, what do we do?\nWe set monetary policy. We also regulate banks, along with an alphabet soup of government agencies.\nWe are the lender of last resort during bona fide emergencies.\nAnd the lede that always gets buried — and I wish it weren’t so overshadowed by discussions of interest\nrates — is that we work within our Districts to help strengthen local communities’ economies. We have\na truly exceptional team in Philadelphia in our Community Development and Regional Outreach\nDepartment, and they work with partners all over the Third District. They’re doing truly vital work on\nemployment, transportation, housing, and other issues.\nBut first, let me talk a bit about monetary policy. Monetary policy is a fairly limited field with a fairly\nconscripted set of tools.\nOur job is to create the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. More than anything, we’re\ntilling the land.\nMonetary policy is about meeting our dual mandate mostly by moving interest rates. There are other\ntools we use, but in normal times, it’s mostly about moving what is technically called the federal funds\nrate. In the media, that’s usually just called the interest rate.\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate on loans that banks make to each other overnight. That rate\ntends to influence interest rates more broadly, so the effect ripples through the economy. When we\nmove the federal funds rate, it affects the interest rate people pay on their mortgages and car loans and\nthat businesses pay to borrow to meet or expand their payrolls or buy inventory. In fact, sometimes just\nannouncing we are planning to raise the federal funds rate in the future affects these lending rates.\nWe set rates when the FOMC meets in Washington, which we do eight times a year.\nRegional Bank presidents don’t always get to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting position every three\nyears, but the governors always do, as does the president of the New York Fed. New York, which\nconducts the Fed’s market operations, enjoys something of a “first among equals” status within the\n4\n\n\fSystem. I’m voting this year. I’ve noticed people care a lot more about what I have to say recently, which\nI’m sure is just a coincidence. Regardless of whether we are voting or not, we do always represent our\nDistricts and play a part in the discussion.\nThe FOMC discussion is never political. Because we’re appointed policymakers, we don’t respond to\nswings in public opinion or election cycles. Unlike elected officials, who suffer the slings and arrows of\nthe 24-hour news machine, we operate in a rare, apolitical bubble. I truly believe that the independence\nof the Fed is crucial to making the best decisions possible for the American economy, free from the\npressures of politics.\nAlthough we’re independent, that doesn’t mean we’re unchecked. The Fed is what’s considered\n“independent within the government.” We’re overseen by Congress, but neither Congress nor the\npresidential administration has a say in the decisions we make.\nThat’s not to suggest the Fed doesn’t come under intense political scrutiny at times, particularly when\neconomic conditions are troubled.\nThe State of the Economy\nI just stepped back in time a few hundred years to consider the Fed’s origins. In keeping with that time\ntravel, I think it’s worth taking a step back and considering, briefly, how much has transpired over the\npast several years. You really can’t understand where our economy is, or where it’s going, without\nconsidering where we’ve come from.\nFirst and foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has\nendured because of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 6.5 million people globally\nhave perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and nearly 50,000\nPennsylvanians. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our\nlifetimes.\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of\nthe pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus\nspread and state and local governments closed businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of\nmillions of Americans lost their jobs in one of the sharpest recessions in American history.\n5\n\n\fThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened\nrestrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed\nand deployed.\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had\nopted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before\nCOVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill,\nand by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial and\ndisparate items like computer chips and cream cheese in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal\nspending from the federal government and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve\nstoked demand. This led to a phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few\ngoods” and the highest inflation in four decades.\nWhere We Are Nationally\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means\ndisproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and\nshelter have skyrocketed in price.\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Since March last year, we raised the target range\nfor the federal funds rate from zero to between 4.5 percent and 4.75 percent. That is a significant move,\nand a very fast one, with the FOMC raising rates 75 basis points at several meetings. But rates are now\nat a level that allow us to slow down and proceed cautiously and, to my mind, the days of us raising 75\nbasis points at a time have surely passed. Just at the last meeting, I voted for a hike of 25 basis points —\nwhat some would call slow but actually is closer to cruising speed when it comes to tightening. In my\nview, we are not done yet … but we are likely close.\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in\nplace and let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a\nsignificant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\n\n6\n\n\fOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal\nReserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, though it does seem like these problems\nare finally easing a bit. Or an endemic shortage of workers, that unfortunately has yet to ease. But we\ncan affect demand by making it more expensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening:\nWe’re seeing unmistakable signs of a slowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy,\nlike housing.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling,\nthe national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly\neven as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans\nare still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered the most during the pandemic, like\nleisure and hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing are\ncooling. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and hybrid\nwork is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban office\nparks.\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created\n4.8 million jobs, and while we are seeing some layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little\nevidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, in the latest data release, a staggering half a\nmillion new jobs were created in January. There is now a record number of Americans employed. And\nindeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.4 percent.\nWhere We Are Locally\nIn the Philadelphia area, conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, this region’s\neconomy reflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing,\nbut maintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug\nalong, and the unemployment rate has fallen and remains low. In fact, in the Philadelphia metropolitan\nstatistical area, the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent — effectively, full employment. As of the\nfourth quarter of 2022, the index for wages and salaries was up above 4 percent year over year in the\nPhiladelphia–Reading–Camden region.\n\n7\n\n\fOf course, even in a hot job market, some positions remain more in demand than others. According to\nan analysis of job listings for the Philadelphia area, some of the most frequent job ads are for registered\nnurses, retail salespeople, software developers, and customer service representatives, reflecting\ncontinued hot demand in health care, tech, and retail.\nNow, our region’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is\nmanufacturing. Responses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook\nSurvey, which covers the area, suggested overall declines in the sector in January. The survey’s\nindicators for current general activity and new orders remained negative, and the survey’s future\nindicators suggest tempered expectations for growth over the next six months.\nHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Single-family price\ngrowth in Philadelphia County is trending downward and was only around 3.6 percent year over year in\nNovember 2022, well down from the 6 percent to 8 percent price growth we experienced during the\npandemic. According to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut has increased over the past year and\nwas 22.7 percent in the Philadelphia metro area as of December. Also in December, the median days on\nthe market for a house for sale in Philadelphia was 41 days, matching the typical pre-pandemic figure,\nand showcasing a softening in conditions. The days of houses selling before they are even listed are in\nour rearview mirror.\nWhere We Are Going\nIn happier news, we are finally starting to see steady progress bringing inflation down across an array of\ngoods. With monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I\nforecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but\nsuggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and\nthen back down to 2 percent in 2025.\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to\nindicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year\nbefore climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\n\n8\n\n\fLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out modestly above\n4 percent this year. It’s an underrated advantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a\nposition of such labor market strength.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions\nfor a healthy labor market. I hope that the first part of my talk was interesting background and that the\nsecond part helped to illuminate today’s economic environment.\nAnd one last historical mention — consider a visit to the First and Second Banks of the U.S. — they’re\nright here in our backyard at Independence National Historical Park.\nSo again, thanks so much for having me. Now let’s get to your questions.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fThe Changing Payments Landscape in a Period of Pandemic Recovery\nDigital Money, Decentralized Finance, and the Puzzle of Crypto\nHosted by the Global Interdependence Center\nThe Conrad Prebys Performing Arts Center\nLa Jolla, CA\nFebruary 10, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello! It’s great to be here in La Jolla. I didn’t realize when I received an invitation from GIC that this\nevent would have a connection to the Super Bowl. As we flew over Arizona, I saw that my connection\nwould be ever so slight — and that the closest I’d get to game tickets would be passing over the stadium\nat 30,000 feet. Go, Eagles!\nThis really is a terrific program, and we’ve already had some informative sessions. So, thank you to GIC\nfor having me and to all of you for joining us today.\nI would like to talk a bit today about the rapidly evolving payments landscape and, in particular, how the\nCOVID-19 pandemic brought unique challenges to American families and accelerated changes that were\nalready in motion. After I deliver my prepared remarks, we can have an open discussion, which I’m very\nmuch looking forward to.\nI will be measuring the economic and financial implications of the pandemic the way economists do,\nwith dollars and percentages and trends. But I do not forget that the pandemic has been — first and\nforemost — a humanitarian tragedy of global scale. More than 6.5 million people perished from the\nvirus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans. And those numbers would have been much\nworse if not for the many public health workers, and others in essential businesses, who stepped up so\nthat others could stay safe.\n\n1\n\n\fConsumer finance is an important area of study at the Philadelphia Fed, where our CFI — Consumer\nFinance Institute — continues to pursue path-breaking research. Simply put, the way Americans spend,\nsave, and invest has profound consequences for the financial industry, the broader economy, and, of\ncourse, American families. Understanding consumer finance patterns — how they change and how they\nwill continue to evolve — is vital to the Federal Reserve’s mission of fostering an economy where\neveryone can prosper.\nAnd speaking of the Federal Reserve, here is where I give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I\nexpress today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nI think we all know that the COVID-19 pandemic changed a lot about American society. Some changes,\nsuch as our inability to convene for events like this one, were thankfully fleeting. But in many areas, the\npandemic simply accelerated changes that were already taking place, and it is quite natural to think that\nthose changes are more likely to remain. To disentangle the fleeting from the long lasting, we need to\nlook at how consumer finance was already changing prior to the pandemic and how the American\npeople — and the institutions that serve them — reacted to the unprecedented circumstances of the\npandemic.\nToday I’ll share some of what we’ve seen in the realms of liquidity, spending, and adoption of new\nfinancial tools over the last few years.\nLiquidity\nI’d like to begin by considering the effect of the pandemic on Americans’ access to liquidity, primarily in\nthe form of cash holdings and checking account balances. A staggering 20 million workers lost their jobs\nin April 2020, and while many were rapidly rehired, total employment only returned to pre-pandemic\nlevels two years later. Data collected in November 2020 in the CFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers\nindicated that more than half of the respondents had experienced some type of disruption to their\nemployment or income since the beginning of the pandemic. As we know, one of the principal federal\nresponses to the crisis was to provide direct stimulus payments (through the CARES Act) and enhanced\nunemployment benefits to Americans. How did these relief measures pass through to consumers’\nwallets?\n\n2\n\n\fThe pandemic certainly made life unpredictable; we can all attest to that. The Diary of Consumer\nPayment Choice found that consumers continued to demand cash in that uncertain environment. This\nFederal Reserve survey showed that, on average, consumers held 25 percent more cash in their wallets\nin 2020 than they did in 2019. This figure dropped in 2021 to be more in line with pre-pandemic levels.\nSimilarly, consumers held more cash at home, in the car, or elsewhere in both 2020 and in 2021 than\nthey did in 2019 by significant amounts.\nTurning to checking account balances, the Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances showed a generally rising\ntrend in checking and similar balances through 2019, but unfortunately, the timing of that triennial\nsurvey did not align well with the crisis.\nI would instead turn to some of the most timely information available on balances in consumer checking\naccounts during the pandemic, published by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. The underlying data are\nbased on a representative sample of their checking account customers. Keeping in mind that those\ncustomers may not be entirely representative of checking or deposit account holders in general, it still\nprovides some illuminating information.\nAccording to the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the median balance in checking accounts increased\nsignificantly from late 2019, spiking at various times matching the largest disbursements of stimulus\nfunds, enhanced unemployment support, and tax refunds. While this phenomenon occurred broadly\nacross their study population, some of the largest increases were seen in the more vulnerable groups.\nDespite this seemingly positive news, it’s important to keep in mind that many of these changes were\nthe result of temporary relief measures implemented by the government. It is unlikely that permanent\nchange takes hold in the overall liquidity of households, particularly of lower-income households. In\nJune 2022, median checking account balances remained significantly higher than they were in 2019, but\nthey were also significantly lower than their peak values realized in March 2021. And while many lowincome consumers had some of the largest increases, a sizable share have average balances lower in\nmid-2022 than prior to the pandemic. As we move further into the post-pandemic economy, it will be\ncrucial to understand which phenomena are likely to revert to the previous norms and which are\nsustainable, and for whom.\n\n3\n\n\fPayments\nWe saw quite profound changes in the way Americans made payments throughout the pandemic. These\nshifts speak to the adaptability of the American people and the financial system during unprecedented\ncircumstances. However, it is also true that many of these changes were already in motion prior to the\npandemic.\nLet me now take a moment to describe what we were seeing before the pandemic. Up until the end of\n2019, there was a gradual decline in the share of consumer transactions that used cash for payments,\nand a much more rapid decline in the number and value of paper checks used to make payments. ACH\ntransactions — typically direct deposit and some bill payments — were growing but no longer as quickly\nas they had over previous decades.\nUnmistakable was the rapid growth in the number and value of credit and debit card payments. Among\nthose, consumer purchases online, typically made by credit and debit cards, outpaced card transactions\nused for in-store purchases. Finally, contactless card payments, digital wallets, and peer-to-peer (P2P)\npayments facilitated by companies like Zelle and Venmo, while still relatively uncommon, were clearly\ngrowing.\nThen COVID-19 hit. And like so much else, the way Americans spent changed drastically.\nThe Federal Reserve Payments Study did a comprehensive job describing the shifts in noncash payments\nthat occurred in the first year of the pandemic. For one, the number of card payments — credit, debit,\nand prepaid — declined in 2020. This was unprecedented. The total dollar value of card payments grew\nslightly, but that growth was well below trend. Industry sources confirm that the weakness was\nprimarily in credit cards. In fact, the value of debit transactions increased substantially in 2020, relative\nto 2019. This shift from credit to debit cards began to reverse in late 2021, with the value of credit\ntransactions growing more rapidly than debit.\nUnpacking these top-level shifts, the mix of in-person and remote payments also changed in these early\npandemic years: In 2018, the total value of in-person and remote payments were about the same, but in\n2020, the value of remote payments exceeded that of in-person card payments by 10 percentage points.\nThis may be a more persistent change because while consumers have resumed going to restaurants and\n\n4\n\n\fgrocery stores, they appear to be still making relatively fewer in-person payments in those locations,\npossibly because they can pay remotely and then pick up their goods.\nThe pandemic also appears to have contributed to significant growth in several recent payment\ninnovations. The growth in the use of contactless cards, for instance, accelerated even while the number\nof in-person payments declined. Contactless payments now account for 4.6 percent of the number of inperson payments, more than double its share in 2019. There was a similar effect for P2P payments and\ndigital wallets. In the first half of 2020, 18 percent of deposit accounts experienced their first P2P\npayment, and 11 percent of credit or debit card accounts experienced their first digital wallet payment. I\ndo not expect these changes to reverse.\nWe talked about cash as a means of storing liquidity, but what about cash as a means of payment? To\nexamine those trends, we look again to the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice. The latest summaries of\nthis survey report that the share of payment transactions made with cash has been falling over time, fell\nprecipitously in 2020, and then actually rose slightly in 2021 as in-person transactions picked up. A bit of\na roller coaster, then. But the bottom line is that the cash share of payments remains well below prepandemic levels — this being a clear example of the pandemic accelerating change that was already in\nmotion.\nFinally, as is often the case, we can learn the most by going directly to the source — in this case, the\nconsumers. Late last year, the Philadelphia Fed’s CFI did just that, asking consumers whether they were\nusing specific forms of payment more or less than they were in 2021. On net, consumers reported using\ncash and checks less and contactless cards more. They also indicated they were using P2P apps and\nmobile payment apps more frequently. As is typically the case, younger consumers tend to be the most\nlikely adopters of payment innovations. Roughly speaking, this suggests that indeed the pandemic\naccelerated the longer-run trends of declining use for paper forms of payment and a more robust\nadoption of new, electronic ways of making payments.\nCryptocurrency\nAnd now for something that can’t get lost between a seat cushion: the latest newcomers to the\nlandscape, cryptocurrencies. As you surely know, cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies (such\nas Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and many others) in which transactions are verified and records are\n\n5\n\n\fmaintained by a decentralized, distributed ledger system using cryptography, rather than by a\ncentralized authority.\nSince the early 2010s, the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies has received significant attention from\nfinancial market participants, policymakers, and academics.\nCryptocurrencies have been marketed in a variety of ways. Early in their existence, they were touted as\na more secure and anonymous method of payment, and a means of keeping funds out of the traditional\nbanking system, while recent messaging has shifted to their value as an investment vehicle.\nCryptocurrency markets have gained a reputation for high volatility in recent years, with rapid price\nincreases and decreases over relatively short periods. For a considerable stretch of time, beginning in\nearly 2019, prices trended up significantly, leading to a perception of cryptocurrencies as lucrative\ninvestment vehicles. Beginning in early 2022, however, the cryptocurrency market experienced what is\ndescribed by some as a crypto winter, a prolonged bear market that resulted in a nearly $2 trillion loss in\nmarket value, coin and exchange collapses, and damage to a number of financial services firms that are\nclosely aligned to the crypto space.\nIn January 2022, CFI, in conjunction with economists from the Federal Reserve Board, included\nquestions related to cryptocurrency ownership and opinions in the CFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers.\nThe survey gave us a basic understanding of the adoption of, and attitudes toward, cryptocurrencies\namong the survey population, with special attention paid to differences across demographic groups. The\nresults of that survey are found in a CFI Research Brief published in December and available on the\nPhiladelphia Fed’s website.\nIn the months since that survey was conducted, the drastic change in prices and associated turmoil —\nagain, the recent period referred to as a crypto winter — likely contributed to a shift in attitudes\nregarding cryptocurrencies among owners and nonowners alike. Therefore, in October 2022, we again\nsurveyed consumers to see how perceptions of cryptocurrencies had changed. I’d like to share some\nhighlights from our published report and touch on some new, previously unpublished, information\nbased on the new survey.\nIn the survey fielded last January, we found that almost one-quarter of respondents, or someone in their\nimmediate family, owned cryptocurrency at that time. Most current crypto owners had acquired those\nassets recently. More than two-thirds of crypto owners last January had acquired their first crypto assets\n6\n\n\fwithin the previous 12 months, almost a third in the previous six months. This surge in adoption took\nplace in a media environment that saw massive increases in the marketing of cryptocurrencies during\n2021. Unlike many of the other changes discussed, the rise of cryptocurrency does not seem to be\ndirectly related to the pandemic, though an environment of low rates, ample liquidity, and, quite\nfrankly, more time at home may have all contributed.\nThe survey asked owners about why they chose to purchase crypto. Just under 30 percent of crypto\nowners cited financial reasons, though some viewed their purchases as short-term investments in\nanticipation of rapid appreciation, while others were looking for long-term investments for stable\ngrowth. Almost one-quarter of crypto owners had acquired their assets out of simple curiosity, and just\nunder 20 percent suggested their decision was influenced either by family or social media. A relatively\nsmall share of crypto owners — around 15 percent — suggested they had acquired their assets primarily\nbecause they expected to use them for transactional purposes.\nWe also asked about future crypto purchase plans. In January 2022, slightly more than half of the\nexisting crypto owners (55 percent) said they were likely to buy more crypto. Nonowners remained\nskeptical, with less than 7 percent of them saying they were likely to buy crypto in the future.\nDemographic analysis of crypto ownership for the most part conforms with our usual expectations. For\nexample, crypto ownership is relatively more common among younger respondents and respondents\nreporting higher incomes. This is consistent with research suggesting that these are categories of\nconsumers who are more likely to be early adopters of new financial tools and technologies. Similarly,\nthe likelihood of owning crypto assets was higher among respondents who were also engaged in mobile\nand P2P payments or mobile banking.\nMen were more likely than women to own crypto assets. Black and Hispanic respondents were more\nlikely to own crypto assets than White respondents.\nNow let’s turn to what we learned when we examined the responses from consumers in the more\nrecent October 2022 survey. Keep in mind that respondents to the January survey had yet to go through\nthe crypto winter, while the October respondents had already lived through most of it. And it shows.\nCrypto ownership among respondents decreased significantly, from 25 percent in January 2022 to 19\npercent in October. We observed decreases in the rate of ownership across nearly all demographic\ngroups. Nevertheless, the relative concentration of crypto ownership across the population changed\n7\n\n\flittle: Younger, male, more affluent, or non-White consumers remain the most engaged demographic\ngroups with crypto.\nFuture plans to purchase more crypto assets cooled, with less than 40 percent of October’s owners\nindicating that they will likely buy more in the future. Remember that, in January, more than half of\nrespondents said they had future plans to purchase more crypto.\nDespite the crypto winter, short- and long-term investment remain the most commonly chosen reasons\nfor buying crypto. Indeed, these reasons seem to have become more important. In October, 35 percent\nof crypto owners cited long-term growth as a principal reason for owning; that is an increase from 29\npercent of crypto owners last January. Somewhat less surprisingly, crypto owners in October were less\nlikely to cite social reasons for holding these assets than were crypto owners last January.\nInterestingly, curiosity remained strong as a purchase reason, increasing from 24 percent of crypto\nowners in January to nearly 30 percent of crypto owners in October. We see this as an indicator that\nthere is still interest among consumers in cryptocurrencies, with the depressed prices of the crypto\nwinter possibly providing an opportunity to satisfy that interest for some.\nWhat do we take from these data? In many ways, it is what we would expect to see from a market after\na downturn: Participation and interest in the market both decreased as groups of consumers shy away\nfrom risk. The strength of investment and experimentation as reasons for participation in the market has\nremained steady and the socioeconomic groups most likely to acquire cryptocurrencies haven’t\nmaterially changed. These patterns seem to suggest that cryptocurrencies will remain in demand by\ncertain consumers despite the recent crypto winter.\nConclusion\nSo, I realize I’ve thrown a lot of data at you. And although we are convening in a college town today, I\npromise there won’t be a quiz. But I am going to assign some homework. Have a look at the Consumer\nFinance section on the Philadelphia Fed website; you’ll find some very interesting work there.\nWhat I do think is that these data offer unique insights about the way American society responded to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented strain. It allows us to discern which changes are likely to\nbe fleeting and which ones were already in motion prior to the pandemic and are likely to be long\nlasting.\n8\n\n\fWe saw how pandemic-era policies and lifestyle shifts led to a run-up in household liquidity; however,\noverall, this run-up is not likely to be sustainable for everyone.\nWe saw Americans embrace new ways of making payments as they, first, shifted to online shopping, and\nthen made changes to their payment habits that apparently have real staying power.\nAnd we’ve seen how consumers responded to dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency markets, slowing,\nbut likely not reversing, the growth of that sector in the coming years.\nWhat we have yet to see is how these shifts will play out in the long run — and how they will affect the\nFederal Reserve’s solemn responsibility of fostering an economy where all Americans can thrive.\nSo, thanks again for having me. Now let’s get to the discussion.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fEconomic Outlook\nNew Jersey Bankers Annual Leadership Forum\nSomerset, NJ\nJanuary 20, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s great to be here. As a lifelong Jersey boy, I’m very glad to be with a group of my\nfellow New Jerseyans. Though as a lifelong South Jersey boy, I’m not so sure how I feel about doing this\nway up here in Somerset.\nI plan to talk a bit about the country’s economic outlook and my approach to monetary policy. Then we\ncan get to questions, which I’m really looking forward to.\nBut before we do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nHow We Got Here\nAs we begin, I think it’s worth taking a step back and considering, briefly, how much has transpired over\nthe past several years. You really can’t understand where our economy is, or where it’s going, without\nconsidering where we’ve come from.\nFirst and foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has\nendured because of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 7.5 million people globally\nhave perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and 35,000 New\nJerseyans. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our\nlifetimes.\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of\nthe pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus\nspread and state and local governments shuttered businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of\n1\n\n\fmillions of Americans were thrown into joblessness in one of the sharpest recessions in American\nhistory.\nThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened\nrestrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed\nand deployed.\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had\nopted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before\nCOVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill,\nand by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial items\nlike computer chips in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal spending from the federal\ngovernment and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve stoked demand. This led to\na phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few goods” and the highest inflation\nin four decades.\nWhere We Are Nationally\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means\ndisproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and\nshelter have skyrocketed in price.\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Last year, we raised the target for the federal\nfunds rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. That was a significant move, and a very fast one,\ngiven that we started the year at about 0 percent. I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this\nyear, though, to my mind, the days of us raising them 75 basis points at a time have surely passed. In my\nview, hikes of 25 basis points will be appropriate going forward.\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in\nplace to let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a\nsignificant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\nOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal\nReserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, or an endemic shortage of workers, though\n2\n\n\fit does seem like these problems are finally easing a bit. But we can affect demand by making it more\nexpensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening: We’re seeing unmistakable signs of a\nslowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling,\nthe national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly\neven as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans\nare still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered the most during the pandemic, like\nleisure and hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing are\ncooling somewhat. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and\nhybrid work is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban\noffice parks.\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created\n4.5 million jobs, and while we are seeing scattered layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little\nevidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, a record number of Americans are employed.\nAnd indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.5 percent.\nWhere We Are Locally\nIn New Jersey, conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, this region’s economy\nreflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing, but\nmaintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug along,\nunemployment claims have stayed low, and the unemployment rate has continued to drop. In fact, in\nthe state of New Jersey, the unemployment rate stands at 3.4 percent — effectively, full employment.\nAs of the third quarter of 2022, wages were up nearly 5 percent year over year in the Philadelphia–\nReading–Camden region.\nOur state’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is manufacturing.\nResponses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, which partially\ncovers New Jersey, suggested overall declines in the sector in January. The survey’s indicators for\ncurrent general activity and new orders remained negative, and the survey’s future indicators suggest\ntempered expectations for growth over the next six months.\n3\n\n\fHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Single-family price\ngrowth in New Jersey is trending downward and was only around 9.5 percent year over year in\nNovember 2022, well down from the double-digit price growth we experienced during the pandemic.\nAccording to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut has increased over the past year and was 22.7\npercent in the Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and 14.3 percent in the New York City\nMSA as of December. In October, meanwhile, the median days on the market for a house for sale in New\nJersey was 51 days, compared with less than 30 days in May 2021, showcasing softening conditions.\nWhere We Are Going\nIn happier news, we are finally starting to see steady progress bringing inflation down across an array of\ngoods. With monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I\nforecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but\nsuggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and\nthen back down to 2 percent in 2025.\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to\nindicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year\nbefore climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out at about 4.5\npercent this year, before falling back toward 4 percent over the next two years. It’s an underrated\nadvantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions\nfor a healthy labor market. Given that you are bankers, I would also mention something I always keep in\nmind as a policymaker: When uncertainty abounds, it pays to be cautious. Just as I, as a member of the\nFOMC, am working to minimize risk, I also urge you all to think about the risks your clients face and to\nmake good decisions to guard against any possible losses.\nSo again, thanks so much for having me. Now let’s get to your questions.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon! It’s great to be back at UD. I had many very happy years as president here, though I did\nrecall the one downside to working here as I made my way down I-95 this afternoon: the traffic.\nIn all seriousness, it’s really an honor to be here for today’s event. I plan to speak a bit about the\nnational economy, monetary policy, and an exciting new initiative from the Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia.

In fact, a record number of Americans are employed.\nAnd indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.5 percent.\nWhere We Are Going\nBut there’s more good news: We are starting to see inflation come down across a spectrum of goods.\nAnd so, with monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I\nforecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year. I want to be clear: This is well over our\n2 percent target. But it is suggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall\nto 2.5 percent in 2024 and then back down to 2 percent in 2025.\n\n3\n\n\fGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to\nindicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year\nbefore climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out at about 4.5\npercent this year, before falling back toward 4 percent over the next two years. It’s an underrated\nadvantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative\nNow, in the remaining few minutes, I’d like to talk a little bit about an exciting new initiative from the\nPhiladelphia Fed called the Anchor Economy Initiative. It’s fitting that we are convening here on the\nSTAR Campus today because this place exemplifies the Anchor Economy Initiative perfectly.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative seeks to quantify the economic impact of higher education institutions\nand hospitals — eds and meds — that we call the anchor institutions in their communities.\nThis is vital work. Anchor institutions are often the largest employers in regions, they’re the producers of\ntalent that other businesses need, and they lay the foundation for durable economic growth.\nThey also have characteristics that other institutions just don’t. For one, even though they’ve made\nsizable leaps in their use of technology in recent years — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic —\nhigher education institutions and hospitals are physically embedded in their communities. In fact, that’s\none of the reasons we call them anchor institutions. Unlike corporate headquarters, manufacturing\nfacilities, or sports teams that can pick up and move, higher education institutions and hospitals tend to\nstay where they are. Hospitals and higher education also tend to be labor intensive, meaning they are\noften among the largest employers in their regions.\nEds and meds also serve as bulwarks against the ups and downs of the business cycle. Enrollment in\ncolleges and universities, for instance, is countercyclical, meaning that when the economy slows,\nusually more people go to school, boosting anchor institutions. Hospitals are also recession resistant;\nafter all, people require medical care no matter how the local economy is faring. All of which suggests\nthat regions with strong anchor institutions may have more durable economies than those without.\n\n4\n\n\fAnd in recent years, we’ve also seen anchor institutions take an increasing interest in building up the\nareas they serve. They are typically critical partners in community development initiatives. We’ve seen\nmore hospitals and universities invest in neighborhood economic development, boosting local\ncommercial corridors, seeding residential real estate development, and building neighborhood\namenities.\nAnchor institutions’ impact goes beyond the immediate. This is a key point that I really want to stress.\nFundamentally, anchor institutions stimulate growth through innovation, commercialization, new\nventure formation, and talent attraction. In that sense, they can drive long-term economic development\nand growth.\nLet’s not sugarcoat things, though. Eds and meds are both being radically disrupted by technology,\ndemographic shifts, and increasing costs. As I alluded to earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated\nboth telehealth and remote learning. This has certainly created opportunities for health systems and\nuniversities to expand their markets, but it also loosened the place-based nature of their services.\nSuddenly, these anchors are, frankly, a little less anchored.\nDemographics are another downside risk, though with disparate impacts for universities and hospitals.\nWith falling birth rates, fewer 18-year-olds are heading to college and even fewer will enroll in the\nfuture, especially if immigration rates remain depressed, as they are now. This demographic shift is most\napparent in the Northeast and Midwest, which also happen to have higher concentrations of colleges\nand universities. That raises real questions about the viability of many of these institutions in the future\n— and the impact that will have on communities.\nOn the other hand, an aging population is one that will require more health care, boosting hospitals.\nEven here, however, the picture is mixed, as many hospitals have closed over the past several years.\nMeanwhile, the ever-rising cost of education and health care means that more people may be priced\nout of accessing eds and meds altogether, which is both a humanitarian concern and an economic one.\nThat’s why, at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve developed what we call the Anchor Economy Dashboard, a\nnew tool that quantifies the impact of higher education institutions and hospitals on more than 500\nregions across the country.\n\n5\n\n\fFor each of these regions, the dashboard calculates the total number of jobs — direct, indirect, or\ninduced — supported by local eds and meds institutions. Direct jobs comprise those employed directly\nby anchor institutions, like doctors, nurses, and college professors. Indirect are those working in fields\nthat directly support anchor institutions, like IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced jobs are\nthose that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate.\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance\nindex for each region. The reliance index provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional\neconomy is on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and\nincorporates measures of impact in terms of employment, income, and gross value added. A reliance\nindex of 1 means a region’s reliance on anchor institutions is at the national average — below that\nmeans it’s less reliant, and above that means it’s more reliant.\nOn a national scale, the dashboard clearly shows what I’ve been talking about: The economic impact of\nanchor institutions is massive; 9 percent of total U.S. employment, 6.3 percent of total U.S. income, and\n8.1 percent of total U.S. gross value added comes from higher education institutions and hospitals. That\ntranslates to 18.2 million jobs, $1.1 trillion in income, and $1.7 trillion in gross value added to the\neconomy.\nFor Delaware, our data support what I suspect a lot of us know intuitively: This state is quite reliant on\nanchor institutions. So, while Delaware’s total employment in eds and meds ranks 46th out of 50 states\nand the District of Columbia, that is largely a result of the state having a small population. Delaware’s\nreliance index, we calculate, is 1.23. In other words, Delaware overindexes on eds and meds\nemployment, income, and gross value added, compared with other regions. Delaware is 23 percent\nmore dependent on eds and meds for jobs, income, and gross value added than the United States as a\nwhole.\nConclusion\nI urge you all — after today’s program — to head over to philadelphiafed.org to delve into the\ndashboard. We have data for 524 regions across the U.S. — truly a treasure trove. I think you’ll find the\ninformation there useful and important.\n\n6\n\n\fIn closing, I’d like to reiterate my thanks to you for attending, and the Federal Reserve’s strong\ncommitment to bringing down inflation. Now let’s get on to the discussion.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s great to be here with so many friends from the chamber and elsewhere. And after a\ncouple of years of virtual events, it’s particularly gratifying to see all of you in 3D! Thanks so much for\nhaving me. It’s truly an honor and a pleasure.\nOf course, given that so many of you are old friends, I’m sure you know what I’m about to say next.\nThat’s right, it’s time for the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nIn a few minutes, I’ll be on a panel devoted to forecasting what 2023 holds in store for our national and\nlocal economies. But, to my mind, you can’t hope to predict what will happen in the future without\nhaving an accurate perception of what’s going on right now.\nThat’s where the Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia’s annual member survey comes in.\nThis survey — and thank you to all who participated — is an invaluable tool for understanding what’s\nhappening right now in the real economy. I hope you all have had a chance to look at the results\nbecause they really do tell us a lot.\nSurvey data are an important tool in the economic business. At the Fed, we look at everything from big\nbroad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures like restaurant reservations\nand mobility data. These data — hard data — tell us a lot.\nBut as a policymaker, I’ve come to believe that soft data like survey results are perhaps equally\nimportant to getting a full understanding of our economic situation. Candidly, an overemphasis on hard\n1\n\n\fdata can lead to policy errors; last year, hard data suggested to us that inflation would be “transitory,”\nwhereas the soft data we were hearing from our contacts indicated that rising prices were proving more\npersistent than we may have expected. Which is to say, paying due attention to soft data is vitally\nimportant to effective policymaking.\nSo again, I hope you will take a few minutes to delve into the survey results. But in the meantime, I want\nto share a few insights that I found particularly important.\nOverall, members reported strong activity in both the region and for their businesses in 2022 compared\nwith 2021. However, expectations for 2023 were mixed. While firms remained somewhat optimistic for\ntheir own operations, they also expressed uncertainty over the expected economic performance of the\nbroader region.\nNot surprisingly — and unfortunately — a vast majority of respondents reported higher prices paid in\n2022 than in 2021. To offset these increased costs, most respondents reported higher prices received in\n2022 than in 2021. Most respondents expect prices to continue to rise this year.\nTurning to the labor market, firms reported having more full-time employees on their payrolls in 2022\nthan during the year prior. While there were a few firms that laid off some of their employees, that\nrepresented a very small percentage of respondents.\nFirms’ wages and benefit costs rose, with nearly all respondents reporting slightly or significantly higher\nlabor costs in 2022 than the year before. Respondents also expect increases to persist into 2023.\nMembers reported that hiring has been a challenge, particularly because of the level of compensation\nbeing demanded by applicants. To hire new workers or retain existing staff, many respondents have\nraised compensation, introduced a remote work policy, or promoted existing employees.\nGiven this backdrop, it’s not surprising that labor was cited as a top concern by many respondents.\nChamber members also cited the availability of financing and interest rates as pressing concerns. This,\ntoo, is no surprise, given changes in monetary policy over the past year.\nSo, I think all in all, you can say respondents have painted a picture of mixed economic conditions. I’d\nexpect similarly mixed conditions in the year ahead, which we can delve into during the panel\ndiscussion. While I recognize forecasting can be a tricky business, I’m very excited for the discussion.\n\n2\n\n\fI will add that one forecast I’m fully confident in making at this point is that the Eagles will soon embark\non a remarkable playoff run.\nAgain, thank you so much for having me.\n\n3\n\n\f"

I plan to speak a bit about the economic outlook for the country and our\nregion, and then we can get to your questions, which I’m really looking forward to.\nBut first, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nHow We Got Here\nIf we take a step back, it’s quite remarkable how much has transpired since we were last together. First\nand foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has endured\nbecause of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 7.5 million people globally have\nperished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and 50,000\nPennsylvanians. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our\nlifetimes.\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of\nthe pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus\nspread and state and local governments shuttered businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of\nmillions of Americans were thrown into joblessness in one of the sharpest recessions in American\nhistory.\n1\n\n\fThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened\nrestrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed\nand deployed.\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had\nopted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before\nCOVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill,\nand by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial items\nlike computer chips in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal spending from the federal\ngovernment and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve stoked demand. This led to\na phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few goods” and the highest inflation\nin four decades.\nWhere We Are Nationally\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means\ndisproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and\nshelter have skyrocketed in price.\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Last year, we raised the target for the federal\nfunds rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. That was a significant move, and a very fast one,\ngiven that we started the year at about 0 percent. I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this\nyear, though, to my mind, the days of us raising them 75 basis points at a time have surely passed. In my\nview, hikes of 25 basis points will be appropriate going forward.\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in\nplace to let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a\nsignificant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\nOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal\nReserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, or an endemic shortage of workers, though\nit does seem like these problems are finally easing a bit. But we can affect demand by making it more\n\n2\n\n\fexpensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening: We’re seeing unmistakable signs of a\nslowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling,\nthe national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly\neven as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans\nare still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered most during the pandemic, like leisure\nand hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing, are cooling\nsomewhat. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and hybrid\nwork is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban office\nparks.\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created\n4.5 million jobs, and while we are seeing scattered layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little\nevidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, a record number of Americans are employed.\nAnd indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.5 percent.\nWhere We Are Locally\nLocal conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, the Philadelphia area’s economy\nreflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing, but\nmaintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug along,\nunemployment claims have stayed low, and the unemployment rate has continued to drop. In fact, in\nthe Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area, the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent —\neffectively, full employment. As of the third quarter of 2022, wages were up nearly 5 percent year over\nyear in the Philadelphia–Reading–Camden region.\nOf course, even in a hot job market, some positions remain more in demand than others. According to\nan analysis of job listings for the Philadelphia area, some of the most frequent job ads are for registered\nnurses, retail salespeople, software developers, and customer service representatives, reflecting\ncontinued hot demand in health care, tech, and retail. I continue to see biotech as a key growth industry\nin our region as well, with firms unable to build wet labs fast enough. That’s driving labor demand not\nonly for PhDs and college graduates, but also those with high school diplomas.\n3\n\n\fNow, our region’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is\nmanufacturing. Responses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey\nsuggested continuing declines in the sector. The survey’s indicators for general activity, new orders, and\nshipments were all negative, and manufacturing firms reported a decline in employment, on balance.\nHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Home price\ngrowth in Philadelphia County is trending downward and was only around 5 percent year over year in\nSeptember 2022. Nearby counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey have higher home price growth,\nranging between 8 percent and 20 percent, respectively, well below the huge gains logged during the\npandemic. According to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut in the Philadelphia metro area has\nincreased over the past several months and was up by more than a quarter in November. In October,\nmeanwhile, the median days on the market for a house for sale in the Philadelphia metro area was 38\ndays. This is closing in on the typical prepandemic figure, which was 41 days, showcasing a softening in\nconditions. The days of houses selling before they are even listed are in our rearview mirror. So, sorry to\nall the realtors in the audience this morning.\nWhere We Are Going\nAlso in the rearview mirror, I expect, are the eye-popping inflation readings of 2022. With monetary\npolicy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I forecast core inflation to\ncome in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but suggestive of clear\nmovement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and then back down to\n2 percent in 2025.\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to\nindicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year\nbefore climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out at about 4.5\npercent this year, before falling back toward 4 percent over the next two years. It’s an underrated\nadvantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions\nfor a healthy labor market.\n4\n\n\fThanks so much for having me. Let’s hope it’s not another three years before we see each other again.\nNow, let’s get to your questions.\n\n5\n\n\f"
