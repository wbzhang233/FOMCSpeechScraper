Moses Dis�nguished Lecture in Transporta�on\nNorthwestern University Transporta�on Center\nNorthwestern University\nEvanston, Illinois\nNovember 8, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Oﬃcer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood evening, everyone.\nTo everyone here at the Northwestern University Transporta�on Center, it is indeed an honor to have\nbeen asked to present this year’s Leon N. Moses Dis�nguished Lecture.\nNow, if I may, here is how I intend to proceed tonight. I will begin by answering what could be a central\nques�on to the evening: “Why does a president of a Federal Reserve Bank care about transporta�on?”\nFrom there, I will share a broad outline of some of the research being conducted by the staﬀ at the\nPhiladelphia Fed, which, I believe, can be put into ac�on to help us achieve a stronger economic and\nmore reliable transporta�on future.\nI will conclude by providing my economic outlook. A�er all, I’ll note that the Moses Lectures in 2011 and\n2017 both centered on U.S. economic outlooks, so why break unnecessarily from this apparent six-year\ncycle? Also, I am acutely aware of the impact that interest rates and monetary policy can have on\ninfrastructure investments.\nAnd if �me allows, I would be happy to engage in a discussion and answer any ques�ons to add further\nclarity to our proceedings.\n1\n\n\fBut ﬁrst, my day job requires me to make one thing very clear. And that is the usual Federal Reserve\ndisclaimer. So, please note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reﬂect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr as folks back home in the Philadelphia region know, when talking about this evening, please say, “Pat\nsaid,” not “The Fed said.”\nNow, with all that business out of the way, let’s dive in.\nI should start by recognizing that I ﬁnd myself in very like-minded company. My predominant area of\nstudy, a�er all, wasn’t economics. It was civil engineering. Economics was that side project that later\nbecame my full-�me job. But my way of looking at things — even in economics — is very much with that\nsame lens I ground in my engineering days.\nNow, let me take this a step further. As an economist, and especially as president and CEO of the\nPhiladelphia Fed, my goal is to ensure a stable economy that provides opportuni�es for everyone to\ngrow and succeed. As an engineer, and speciﬁcally as a civil engineer, my goal is to ensure a safe,\nreliable, and stable infrastructure, which provides opportuni�es for all communi�es to grow and\nsucceed.\nI know I am far from the ﬁrst person to recognize this important interdisciplinary rela�onship. I can just\nlook around this room to know there are many others who do as well. And ﬁ�ngly enough, all the way\nback in 1917, John Hayford, then director of the College of Engineering here at Northwestern University,\nwrote an essay in the Journal of Poli ical Economy �tled “The Rela�on of Engineering to Economics,”\nfrom which I will read the following:\nEconomics and engineering are closely related. Economics has been deﬁned as the\nsocial science of earning a living. With the same appropriateness, engineering may be\ndeﬁned to be physical science applied to helping groups … to make a beter living. 1\n\nSee John F. Hayford, “The Rela�on of Engineering to Economics,” Journal of Political Economy, 25:1, available at\nuchicago.edu.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fThose words ring just as true 106 years later.\nBut in my current capacity, I can look to the Federal Reserve’s own dual mandate, the two pillars of our\nins�tu�onal mission that Congress handed to us in the late 1970s: price stability and maximum\nemployment. And neither, I could argue, are achievable without some level of modern transporta�on\ninfrastructure, and more speciﬁcally, engineering for modern transporta�on infrastructure.\nThe ability of goods and services to ﬂow to and from markets helps ensure that prices can remain stable.\nAnd we cannot achieve maximum employment unless employers have accessible places in which to site\ntheir businesses and workers have a way to get to and from those places of employment.\nNow, certainly, the Federal Reserve does not build transport infrastructure. But the monetary policy\ndecisions we make and implement have a direct impact on the ability of those actors responsible for\nsuch ac�ons to undertake them. I will return to this thought later in my economic outlook.\nBut with this overall intellectual background, where do we ﬁnd ourselves at this moment? By any\nmeasure, we are at a cri�cal �me not just in our economy, but for our infrastructure. We are now\nroughly 70 years removed from our na�on’s last, great infrastructure boom, including the construc�on of\nthe Interstate Highway System. And as with most things, �me isn’t always kind. The condi�ons of our\ninfrastructure call out for broad investment, and the condi�ons of our economy require us to look anew\nat what infrastructure means to our overall health, both literally and ﬁgura�vely.\nWithout a doubt, the United States would not be the preeminent global economy if not for our\ninfrastructure. We are a vast na�on, and our roads, bridges, tunnels, rails, and airports are very much the\n�es that bind the union together. But in what condi�on do we currently ﬁnd these �es?\nFor the past almost 70 years, we have been in a mode to maintain the infrastructure we currently have.\nWe became very good at ﬁxing things, and, let’s face it, we s�ll are. Case in point: When a sec�on of\nInterstate 95 in Northeast Philadelphia collapsed this summer — prac�cally paralyzing the East Coast’s\nmost essen�al transit corridor — it only took a mater of days for an ingenious repair plan to be put into\nplace and the road reopened. But in some ways, this is the excep�on to the usual cycle of infrastructure\n3\n\n\frepair, as it took cu�ng through red tape and a quicker-than-usual accoun�ng of the economic ac�vity\nbeing lost for oﬃcials to spring into ac�on at such speed.\nTransporta�on infrastructure, as we all know, is expensive to undertake and o�en slow to accomplish.\nBut the I-95 collapse and rebuild could also become a pivot point for the way we look at infrastructure. I\ncould argue that the way many have tradi�onally looked at infrastructure is much akin to the old Oscar\nWilde line about those who “[know] the price of everything and the value of nothing.” We’ve become\nvery good at knowing how much a project will cost, but we haven’t been as good at explaining the value\nof a project — the long-range economic and quality of life beneﬁts inherent in it. And so, I would say this\nis not just a �me for us to get beter at ﬁxing, but a �me for us to take a fuller stock of the results of what\nwe built in the ﬁrst place and the long-term implica�ons of what we may build in the future.\nI-95 in Philadelphia in itself is a good example for us to examine both of these thoughts. And, at the\nPhiladelphia Fed, it’s also perfectly located for us to do just that.\nIf you travel on I-95 through Philadelphia, it stands out in several ways. The ﬁrst is more sensory and\ntac�le: I-95 severed the residents of Philadelphia from the Delaware River waterfront. In the 1950s, the\nriverfront was overwhelmingly industrial, and the residen�al areas located on it were older, so litle\nthought was likely given to the construc�on of an elevated highway with beter water views than the\nnewer buildings and houses to its west.\nBut I-95 was also constructed in an age when suburban living became the new model of the American\nDream, and when highways could speed families out of city centers and into new single-family home\ndevelopments, complete with yards and driveways, in neighboring coun�es. And when a highway was\nbuilt, the noise and air pollu�on from that many cars and trucks helped push those who could aﬀord it\ntoward those new suburban developments.\n\n4\n\n\fLast year, two of my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed, Vice President and Economist Jeﬀrey Lin and\nEconomic Advisor and Economist Jeﬀrey Brinkman, took a closer look at I-95, its impact in depopula�ng\nPhiladelphia, and the poten�al beneﬁts of capping the highway. 2\nAnd Lin, I should note, is a Wildcat, having completed his undergraduate studies in economics and\nmathema�cal methods in the social sciences here at Northwestern, and studied under Dr. Leon Moses.\nSo, my colleagues started by looking at the popula�on eﬀects of freeways on central city neighborhoods,\nand what they found, if not startling, is s�ll stark. The standard narra�ve is that freeways provide access\nto opportuni�es. And this was true in the suburbs — freeways atracted development and popula�on.\nBut this was decidedly not the case in central ci�es. Lin and Brinkman found, in central ci�es, a\npopula�on decline of nearly one-third in the census tracts closest to freeways, while the popula�ons in\nthe tracts more than two miles from the nearest freeway increased by more than 50 percent. And the\ndecline in those neighborhoods closer to a freeway makes sense, not just because of noise and pollu�on,\nbut because of the nega�ve barrier eﬀects to local ameni�es — the dead-ending of streets that\npreviously provided through access to jobs or shopping, making previously straight-forward trips longer\nfor residents.\nLin and Brinkman also calculated the value of neighborhood ameni�es in areas of Philadelphia closest to\nfreeways to be roughly 11 percent lower than in those areas farther out — and in a similar analysis, they\nfound a 17 percent diﬀerence in Chicago.\nEngineering created a means for speeding people and goods between ci�es and from city centers and\ninto suburbia, and beyond. The Interstate Highway System was an enormous achievement, and it created\nbig beneﬁts for some. It also had enormous costs for others, especially residents of central ci�es.\nBut engineering now has the opportunity to mi�gate some of that damage, to eliminate barriers to\nameni�es, and in the process, create new economic incen�ves for folks to move back and opportuni�es\nfor those who stayed.\n\nSee Jeﬀrey Brinkman and Jeﬀrey Lin, “The Costs and Beneﬁts of Fixing Downtown Freeways,” Economic Insights,\nQ1 2022, available at philadelphiafed.org.\n2\n\n5\n\n\fWe know, through both anecdotal evidence and through fron�er research, that more people, especially\nyoung college graduates, are looking anew at urban living. 34 New work from home op�ons means that\nci�es and towns are compe�ng even more on the quality of life they can oﬀer residents. Addi�onally,\ntraﬃc throughout the Philadelphia Metro area has become so endemic that one of those ini�al beneﬁts\nof living in the suburbs — speedy access to the urban core — has been all but eliminated.\nThe Philadelphia waterfront today is a place where former warehouses and factories are being\nrepurposed and renovated for residen�al and more ground-level commercial uses. The Delaware River\nitself is also a cleaner estuary, and one which the city has con�nually sought to highlight for both\nresidents and tourists through projects like the Penn’s Landing Fes�val Pier, the mul�modal Delaware\nRiver Trail, and a just-started project to cap a one-10th of a mile por�on of I-95 at Penn’s Landing to\nbecome a new urban park.\nAnd Lin and Brinkman even looked at this last idea: capping I-95 to reconnect neighborhoods with\nameni�es. But they looked at a much bigger landscape than the current project, which is geared to only\na small part of I-95 adjacent to the neighborhoods directly east of Center City and the tourist and\nbusiness heart. They conceived of a project to cover a litle more than four miles of I-95 and simulated\nits poten�al impact. And what their simula�on suggests is a poten�al popula�on boom in those\nneighborhoods that I-95 eﬀec�vely cut oﬀ and to some extent emp�ed, as connec�ons between those\nneighborhoods and the city at-large were remade.\nThey also calculated that the beneﬁt to households in these neighborhoods at roughly $245 million per\nyear, or $3.5 billion over the life�me value of such a project, was greater than the es�mated current cost\nof undertaking such a program. These are big numbers. What they point to is the signiﬁcant damage that\nhighway construc�on did to central city neighborhoods. What they also point to are the signiﬁcant\ncurrent opportuni�es for remedia�ng that damage, if we can also focus on the value of these\ninvestments, instead of only the costs.\n\nSee Victor Couture and Jessie Handbury, “Urban Revival in America,” Journal of Urban Economics, September\n2020, available at ScienceDirect.\n3\n\nSee Nathaniel Baum-Snow and Daniel Hartley, “Accoun�ng for Central Neighborhood Change, 1980–2010,”\nJournal of Urban Economics, 117, May 2020, available at ScienceDirect.\n4\n\n6\n\n\fBut it’s not just about plan�ng grass. While parks and open space are vital, we cannot discount\ninfrastructure that could link neighborhoods together. Public transit has poten�ally a large role to play\nhere. With limited excep�ons of, for example, the New York City Subway or Boston’s T, we o�en think of\nmass transit mostly in terms of bringing suburbanites back into ci�es. In Philadelphia, for example, the\nregional Southeastern Pennsylvania Transporta�on Authority (SEPTA) is o�en skewered by\nPhiladelphians for a percep�on that it caters mostly to suburbanites — a gripe rooted in the fact that\nprepandemic, from 2007 to 2017, SEPTA’s suburban-based Regional Rail system received the plurality of\nthe agency’s capital funds even though inner-city transit atracted far more riders. 5 Fair or not,\npercep�on maters and can sway public acceptance.\nAgain, this is an area where there is guiding research from the Philadelphia Fed. Economic Advisor and\nEconomist Chris Severen looked at the economic beneﬁts of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system, an\nambi�ous eﬀort to draw people from the epicenter of the na�on’s car culture out of their autos and into\nmass transit. 6\nWhat Severen found was a 15 percent increase in transit use when Angelenos were commu�ng from one\nneighborhood to another directly connected by Metro Rail. The increase in Metro Rail commu�ng in\ndirectly adjacent census tracts was 10 percent.\nA common concern these days with local infrastructure investments is who beneﬁts. Are the beneﬁts\ngoing to incumbent residents who may have been harmed by past policy? Or are they going to incoming\nresidents who end up displacing exis�ng residents? On the other hand, some people might worry that\ntransit access might actually hurt neighborhoods, for example, by introducing more noise or conges�on.\nInteres�ngly, in the LA Metro case, these neighborhoods did not experience a lot of disrup�ve change.\nThe appearance of a Metro Rail sta�on did not bring in a new wealthy subset. What Metro Rail primarily\ndid was to enhance resident choice of transporta�on op�ons. It added an amenity in which residents\nfound an intrinsic value — the ability to ditch their car. The added beneﬁts of those cars that were kept\noﬀ the streets, in terms of traﬃc, noise, and pollu�on, just become a bonus. More than that, it may have\n\nSee Jim Saksa, “SEPTA Riders Overwhelmingly Take the Bus and Subway. Why Does Regional Rail Receive More\nFunding?” May 2017, available at WHYY.\n5\n\nSee Christopher Severen, “A Ticket to Ride: Es�ma�ng the Beneﬁts of Rail Transit,” Economic Insights, Q2 2020,\navailable at philadelphiafed.org.\n6\n\n7\n\n\fchanged percep�ons of transit as something only for the suburbs or wealthy residents. Again, this kind\nof research is helping us learn about the value of transporta�on infrastructure — the long-range\neconomic and quality of life beneﬁts.\nSuch infrastructure projects may be cri�cal in undoing one of the great transporta�on engineering\ninjus�ces of all. We now know that highways cut oﬀ people from opportuni�es today. But this might\nunderstate their nega�ve eﬀects on the next genera�on tomorrow — through increased racial\nsegrega�on and the decreased intergenera�onal economic opportuni�es that con�nue to this day.\nAnd this brings me to a third bit of research in which the Philadelphia Fed was involved. Economic\nAdvisor and Economist Bryan Stuart recently teamed up with researchers from the University of Texas\nand UCLA. 7 Their window into these intergenera�onal eﬀects was to look at the long-term economic\nimpacts from the historical placement of railroads. And they found, true to the cliché, that there was a\n“wrong side of the tracks.” The placement of railroad tracks cemented segrega�on within communi�es\nand limited the upward mobility of speciﬁcally Black children who the tracks separated from community\nameni�es such as schools and jobs.\nWe can see this in Philadelphia, too, which has the unfortunate dis�nc�on of being the “poorest big city”\nin the na�on, and the 11th most racially segregated 8 with a citywide poverty rate above 20 percent. But\nis this just a mater of bad luck for these families who ﬁnd themselves below the poverty line? The\nresearch conducted by the Philadelphia Fed would say no. Many of these outcomes were caused by past\npolicies. Many of them could be addressed through transporta�on infrastructure investments today to\nbeter connect workers, families, and opportuni�es.\nIn 2022, Larry Santucci, a senior advisor and research fellow at the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance\nIns�tute, released his work in which he mapped the history of racial covenants at nearly 4,000 proper�es\n\nSee Eric Chyn, Kareem Haggag, and Bryan Stuart, “The Eﬀects of Racial Segrega�on on Intergenera�onal\nMobility: Evidence from Historical Railroad Placement,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper\n23-18 (2023), htps://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/regional-economics/eﬀects-of-racial-segrega�onon-intergenera�onal-mobility-evidence-historical-railroad-placement.\n7\n\n8\n\nSee “A Map of Racially Restric�ve Covenants in the City of Philadelphia,” Consumer Finance Data,\n\nhtps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/consumer-ﬁnance-data/racial-covenants.\n\n8\n\n\fcitywide. 9 Racially restric�ve covenants were one of the tools that early 20th century developers, home\nbuilders, and White homeowners used to prevent non-White individuals from accessing certain\nneighborhoods and homes. Allow me a moment to explain the ﬁndings in Santucci’s own words:\nWe didn’t see a lot in areas of the city where the housing stock was older, such as\nalong the Delaware waterfront, where White residents may have been happy to vacate\n… But we did ﬁnd racial covenants bordering White and non-White neighborhoods and\ncordoning oﬀ the up-and-coming, more suburban areas in the Northeast, Northwest,\nand Southwest sec�ons of Philadelphia.\nOn a map, many of the areas of Philadelphia directly impacted by the growth of highways and the White\nﬂight it enabled stand out in this proposi�on. Santucci speciﬁcally notes the Delaware River waterfront,\nthe example with which I opened this talk. But even today, residents in the majority Black neighborhoods\nof Philadelphia and the surrounding region face commute �mes, on average, that are 34 minutes longer\nper week than their White counterparts. Or put another way, in the span of a year, Black commuters lose\na whole 24-hour day in commu�ng �me that White commuters keep for themselves. That was the\nﬁnding of another recent report by Severen and his Research Analyst Nassir Holden. 10\nThis research can serve as the star�ng place for engineers and local oﬃcials, if not indeed federal ones,\nto take a more holis�c approach to transporta�on. Simply making repairs, while necessary, in many ways\nwill only extend or even exacerbate long-standing inequi�es and inequali�es. Simply making a repair to a\nfreeway that stands as an impediment to economic progress and equity won’t remove it as an\nimpediment — it will only solidify its standing for more years.\nSimply valuing infrastructure in the same old way, usually by the ﬂow of cars or people, is self-limi�ng.\nWe should start valuing its beneﬁts in greater totality, and especially the beneﬁts to those who are\nsituated near these projects. And the Philadelphia Fed’s research is helping us to beter deﬁne these\nbeneﬁts.\n\nSee “Q&A: Larry Santucci on Philadelphia’s Racially Restric�ve Covenants and Their Las�ng Eﬀects,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia, available at philadelphiafed.org.\n9\n\nChristopher Severen and Nassir Holden, “Not All Rush Hours Are the Same,” Economic Insights, Q3 2023,\navailable at philadelphiafed.org.\n10\n\n9\n\n\fBut certainly, these improvements will not just happen on their own or through the benevolence of\nothers. We must pay for them. Local governments collect taxes, some of which are used for local\ninfrastructure, but most infrastructure projects have costs that require them to be bonded out over\nyears. Those funds allow for construc�on workers to be employed and for materials to be purchased.\nAnd that is where the Federal Reserve’s ac�ons can have an impact and where I, as a member of the\nFOMC, recognize my place in this transporta�on future, if even just tangen�ally. But our ac�ons on\nmonetary policy do have a direct impact on the borrowing rates for such bonds, among so much more.\nOur eﬀorts to tame inﬂa�on mean stabilizing the costs of construc�on and labor.\nAnd with that, I would like to give you a brief overview of my overall economic outlook. As you are\naware, a week ago, at our last mee�ng, the FOMC voted to hold the policy rate steady — our second\nconsecu�ve hold and the third in the last four mee�ngs a�er 10 consecu�ve interest rate hikes.\nI not only voted to support keeping the policy rate steady, but I was also among the ﬁrst of my colleagues\nto state my posi�on that the �me had come to do so, possibly for a while. Let’s rewind for a moment.\nWe did a lot in not a lot of �me. We rapidly moved monetary policy into restric�ve territory to tame\ninﬂa�on and get it heading back down to our target of a 2 percent annual rate.\nNow, what we didn’t do was give the folks living in this economy, whether businesses or families, a lot of\n�me to adjust in between rate hikes. And today, if you look along the trend lines, we are experiencing a\nslow but steady disinﬂa�on. Interest rates remain in restric�ve territory and, so long as they are, they\nwill con�nue to put a damper on inﬂa�on.\nYes, this economy is proving to be resilient and at �mes unwilling to bend to the will of economic\nmodels, but I believe that the path we are on is the correct one.\nI am not going to be swayed easily by a single month’s worth of data. One month can just be an outlier\nand not a harbinger. But we don’t know unless we have more outward months to weigh against it. With\nmonetary policy, there are always lags. Holding the rate steady will give those lags �me to catch up. It\nwill allow us to make more measured and educated policy rate decisions going forward — decisions,\nwhich I must add, could go either way, depending upon what the data tell us.\n10\n\n\fBut for the moment, as I said, I see a slow but steady disinﬂa�on occurring. I s�ll expect inﬂa�on to fall\nbelow 3 percent year over year in 2024 and to get down to our 2 percent target therea�er.\nI do expect GDP growth to cool oﬀ in the coming quarters, but I do not expect a recession.\nConsumers have been powering recent GDP growth — more than half of last quarter’s increase was due\nto consumers con�nuing to open their wallets. Time will tell if they have exhausted their pandemic-era\nsavings and begin to ratchet down their own spending. Time will tell the full impact of the restart of\nstudent loan payments for countless borrowers. But I would also argue that a conﬁdent American\nconsumer is not a problem. Indeed, they may be the ones ul�mately capable of helping us achieve the\nso� landing we all envision and that has proved quite elusive in the past.\nIt is also clear that the labor market is coming into a much beter balance. I an�cipate the\nunemployment rate to end the year slightly elevated from where it currently stands — to about 4\npercent — and to rise slowly in 2024 to about 4.5 percent before dropping again to 4 percent. That\nwould put us back in line with the natural rate of unemployment, where the labor market and steady 2\npercent inﬂa�on can coexist in balance.\nOf course, there are many lurking uncertain�es. The posi�ve movements to setle the auto worker\nstrikes give us hope that things may soon return to normal for workers and employers. But even then,\nthere are s�ll other labor ac�ons that are slowing down other industries, such as the actors’ strike.\nWe are also now only nine days away from a poten�al federal government shutdown, the impact of\nwhich would only grow the longer it goes on and could poten�ally trim a full percentage point oﬀ fourth\nquarter GDP. And of course, there are interna�onal issues that can impact our own economy.\nBut at the end of the day, while I see us on the path of taming inﬂa�on and protec�ng our economic\nunderpinnings, I would also cau�on that a decrease in the policy rate is not something that is likely to\nhappen in the short term. I ascribe to the posi�on that rates are going to have to remain higher for\nlonger, as the other downward pressures on inﬂa�on work in tandem with the current policy rate to\nreturn our economy to balance.\n11\n\n\fAnd for transporta�on, this higher-rate climate may have an impact on our ability to see some new\nprojects get from the drawing board to shovels in the ground. The necessary repairs will s�ll be done,\nand projects already begun will con�nue.\nBut progress is something for which America has always been known. And the more we take our eyes\nexclusively oﬀ the costs of a project to the overall economic beneﬁt of a project, the more we will see\nthat price tags, while important, aren’t the only thing to consider.\nWe can s�ll, if we take the research into considera�on, make Oscar Wilde proud.\nAnd with that, I will conclude my prepared remarks for this evening. I once again thank you all for the\nprivilege to be here. I would be happy to take your ques�ons.\n\n12\n\n\f"

So, allow me to briefly give you my economic outlook and a brief overview of current\nbanking conditions in the Third Federal Reserve District as our launching off point for this discussion.\nBut before we do anything, I must get the first piece of business out of the way, and that is the usual\nFederal Reserve disclaimer: The views I express this morning are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n1\n\n\fSo, I will begin with the following: I remain rooted in my opinion that we are at the point where holding\nthe policy rate steady is the prudent position to take. I arrived at this decision after carefully reviewing\nboth the hard data and what I’ve been hearing directly from contacts throughout the Third District.\nFurther, economic and financial conditions are continuing to evolve as I have been expecting, though I\nam keeping a close eye on the latest data. There has not been the abrupt shift in data that would lead\nme to change my current position.\nThe available data for September have mostly come out stronger than I expected. The latest on retail\nsales confirms that households retained spending power and did not seem shy to use it over the\nsummer. A resilient consumer is not a problem. Indeed, perhaps the key tenet of a soft landing is that\nhouseholds get to adjust their plan for when and how it best serves them — as opposed to the kind of\ndrastic, unavoidable adjustments that come with, say, suddenly losing their job.\nTruthfully, the momentum in consumer spending is a bit of a head-scratcher. Contacts talk of a more\ncautious, price-sensitive consumer. Major surveys also show a steady drop in consumer confidence since\nthe summer. But there could have been some specific factors at play over the summer that we have yet\nto fully parse out, or we could be right at a turning point, or perhaps the fundamentals are even\nstronger for households.\nLet me stop here to state three things. First, we are not going to tolerate a reacceleration in prices.\nSecond, while I stand ready to revise my views and act accordingly if I see signs of reinflation, I am also\nnot going to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability in data.\nAnd third, we must remain data dependent, and that includes making sure we separate that which could\njust be noise from that which could be an actual signal. But to make that differentiation — and make it\nwith certainty, as we must — we will need several months of data that we can average.\nAnd this also includes data from the impacts of lingering uncertainties to which we must remain\nattuned. Prolonged labor strikes, the restart of student loan payments, and international events each\ncome with their own set of economic effects. But we won’t necessarily know their extent for some time.\nWe will need to see the data.\n2\n\n\fThe mechanics of the economy cannot be rushed. We raised the policy rate by more than 5 percentage\npoints in the span of a little more than a year. That’s a lot of change in not a lot of time. We know that\nthe full impacts of those increases may not yet be fully absorbed across the economy. We also turned\naround our balance sheet with near equal speed. We put ourselves in restrictive territory very quickly.\nBut the speed with which we worked then is also part of my argument for holding steady now. As I\nnoted, policy rates are restrictive, and holding them steady now will keep us in restrictive territory and\nsteadily pressing down on inflation. This is a time where doing nothing is doing something, and, in fact,\nI’d argue that it equates to doing quite a lot.\nSo, allow me to quickly give you my projections based on this stance.\nFirst, on inflation: While headline PCE inflation remains elevated above target, it is almost half of what it\nwas last year on a year-over-year basis. And August’s monthly reading was the smallest month-overmonth increase since 2020. The data I see, and all that I hear, point to a steady disinflation that is\nalready under way and sustained, if slow. My projections have inflation dropping below 3 percent in\n2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent target thereafter.\nI expect GDP growth, which has been outperforming estimates from earlier this year, to continue\nthrough the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But while I anticipate the rate of GDP\ngrowth to moderate, I do not anticipate a contraction. I do not project a recession.\nAnd looking at jobs, I anticipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — just slightly above\nwhat the unemployment rate is now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5\npercent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. This path would put the unemployment figure in\nline with the natural rate of unemployment, or that theoretical level where labor market conditions\nsupport stable 2 percent inflation.\nNow, this does not mean that I expect mass layoffs. I do not. There are multiple factors that can all\ninfluence unemployment rates, including technological changes in the workplace, more workers\n\n3\n\n\freentering the labor force, or other public policy choices that may impact workers’ decisions regarding\ntheir own jobs. And sometimes these forces simultaneously exert their push and pull.\nSo, when we look at all of this, my view is that we need to exhale, allow the policy actions we’ve taken\nto continue to work, and closely watch the data before making any decisions on moving the policy rate\nin either direction. A resolute, but patient, stance on monetary policy will allow us to achieve the soft\nlanding that we all wish for our economy.\nNow, as for when I anticipate rates coming back down? That is a question to which I don’t yet have an\nanswer. My forecasts are based on what I know as of now. And as time goes by, as adjustments are\ncompleted, as new data emerge, and as we gain additional insight on the underlying trends, I may need\nto adjust my forecasts, and with them, my time frames. Suffice it to say, rates will need to stay high for a\nwhile.\nNow, let me briefly turn our attention to banking and financial conditions as we currently see them in\nthe Third District. Bill and I will be able to dive more deeply into this area with you during our discussion.\nBut here are the broad strokes.\nI’ll start by recognizing that, overall, current capital levels remain adequate as institutions across the\nDistrict continue to have sufficient liquidity. Thankfully, banks throughout the District have not\nexperienced widespread drop-offs in deposits, and deposit levels have been on a return upward toward\nhistorical levels. Earnings remain strong, though an increase in interest expense remains a concern.\nBusiness lending has continued, though it was reported to me by contacts that many borrowers have\nbeen turning their focus to their “must haves,” not their “like to haves.” The decrease in mortgage\nactivity has been notable, as has been widely reported — and certainly this is true both here in our\nregion and nationwide. Asset quality throughout lending portfolios has remained favorable.\nThirty-day delinquency rates among all active loans, while trending higher, remain below their historical\nand prepandemic levels.\n\n4\n\n\fHowever, with all of this comes both interest rate and liquidity risks as deposits return to their\nprepandemic levels, the funding gap that it is creating, and the balance sheet impacts of the increases in\npolicy rates.\nOne of the largest concerns to me, at least in the immediate Philadelphia area, remains the commercial\nreal estate (CRE) sector. Office vacancy rates remain above their prepandemic levels, while office net\nabsorption rates remain stubbornly negative. The placement of the Wanamaker Building, arguably one\nof this city’s premier addresses, into receivership looms large.\nHowever, District-wide, it has been reported through contacts that CRE portfolios aren’t necessarily\nfacing the same risks as here in Philadelphia. As one contact relayed, the local dentist offices aren’t\ngoing to remote work. So, overall, CRE lending and loan performance remains sound.\nOn the operational side, we have continued to urge our contacts to remain vigilant to cyberattacks and\nto carefully monitor any novel tech-driven activities with which they may become engaged, including in\ncrypto and partnerships with nonbanks to deliver financial services to customers.\nBut, again, throughout the District, the banking sector remains strong and not broadly impacted by the\nspring’s banking turmoil. Customers can have faith in their deposits and in their financial institutions.\nLook, overall, we continue to be in a sound region of the country. Earlier this week, at a prior event, I\nwas asked about our region’s economic health. My response was the following: Philadelphia doesn’t\nseem to ride the highs or lows that other regional economies do; we seem to always just keep going.\nAnd that is where I would put us at this moment. Our region continues to move along. We see positive\nsigns for our economy and our collective future.\nI think that’s good point for me to end. I am sure you have questions, and I am eager to get to them.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fFuture Monetary Landscape Is Being Painted by\nBoth Hard and Soft Data\nChartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Society Philadelphia’s 80th Anniversary Celebration\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 19, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood evening.\nThank you, Floyd, for that welcome and introduction, and my thanks to you and to Executive Director\nPete Conners for putting together this evening’s program.\nI thank each of you as well for joining us this evening, given there is, shall we say, a competing event. I\nmust note that this is the second time in as many weeks in which Major League Baseball did not first\nconsult the Philadelphia Fed’s event calendar when making the Phillies’ playoff schedule. However,\nwhile I’m not particularly superstitious, when this happened last week, the Phillies won 10-2, so maybe\nthere’s something to this after all. But just in case, I’m wearing my Phillies tie.\nI also congratulate you for the reason we’re all here tonight — to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the\nCFA Society Philadelphia. Membership in an organization such as this isn’t just a good thing to have for\nthe networking opportunities or even for the chance to hear a Federal Reserve Bank president opine on\nmonetary policy. It’s also good for the industry and for your clients, as it puts confidence in your\ncommitment to them and their financial futures and in the high standards of governance espoused by\nthe CFA Society Philadelphia.\nNow, speaking of monetary policy, I plan on sharing my overall thoughts and insights on the economic\nlandscape before us — both nationally and in our region. Then, as Floyd said, we’ll get this podium out\nof the way and get to having a conversation where we can drill down on specific issues. And believe me,\nas much as I may enjoy standing up here, I much more enjoy engaging in direct conversation.\n1\n\n\fBut before we can get to any of this, there is one piece of business to which I must attend, and that is\nthe usual Federal Reserve disclaimer: The views I express this evening are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nI’ve recently boiled this down to the following: Anything I say tonight is a simple matter of “Pat said,”\nnot “The Fed said.” So, let’s use that.\nAs you can imagine, the thing I get asked about most — whether by the press, audiences such as\nyourselves, or even my friends — is interest rates.\nSo, let me begin by painting my picture of the economic landscape with the following broad\nbrushstroke: Over the past several months, I have been clear in my view that, absent a stark turnabout\nin the data that I see and the on-the-ground testimonies of contacts that I hear, I believe that we are at\nthe point where we can hold rates where they are. And so far, economic and financial conditions are\nevolving roughly as I expected, though I am keeping a close eye on the latest data, which have come in a\ntad stronger than my baseline forecast.\nLet me roll back the clock a bit to 2022, when we started the pivot to a restrictive stance.\nIn a span of barely over a year, we not only did a lot, but we did it very fast. The policy rate went up by\nmore than 5 percentage points, reaching its highest level in more than two decades. We also turned\naround our balance sheet policy, and we turned it around fast.\nThe speed in which we worked then is also part of my argument for holding steady now. The workings of\nthe economy cannot be rushed, and we know there are lags, which mean that the full impacts of the\nhigher rates may not yet be fully absorbed. I heard this very clearly from my discussions with contacts\nacross the financial sector throughout the summer, as my viewpoint evolved to its current state.\n\n2\n\n\fAnother part of my argument can be summarized this way: Doing nothing is doing something. And I\nthink doing nothing at this moment equates to doing quite a lot. As long as policy rates remain\nrestrictive, we will keep steadily pressing down on inflation and bringing markets into better balance.\nAnd I further believe that a resolute, but patient, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the\nsoft landing that we all wish for our economy.\nLook at the latest data on PCE inflation — it may have remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year\nover year, but it is down 3 percentage points from this time last year. Even when the volatile aspects of\nenergy and food costs are stripped away to give us the core measure of PCE inflation that economists\nbelieve is a better harbinger of trends, we also see clear signs of progress. In fact, the August monthly\nreading was its smallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\nNow, that said, the available data for September have mostly come out stronger than I expected. The\nlatest on retail sales confirms that households retained spending power and did not seem shy to use it\nover the summer. A resilient consumer is not a problem. Indeed, perhaps the key tenet of a soft landing\nis that households get to adjust their plan for when and how it best serves them — as opposed to the\nkind of drastic, unavoidable adjustments that come with, say, suddenly losing their job.\nTruthfully, the momentum in consumer spending is a bit of a head-scratcher. Contacts talk of a more\ncautious, price-sensitive consumer. Major surveys also show a steady drop in consumer confidence since\nthe summer. But there could have been some specific factors at play over the summer that we have yet\nto fully parse out, or we could be right on a turning point, or perhaps the fundamentals are even\nstronger for households.\nWe simply do not know. But we know that we do not know, and I believe that we should proceed\naccordingly: with caution and patience.\nLet me be clear, though. Certainly, we are not going to tolerate a reacceleration in prices. I stand ready\nto revise my views and act accordingly if I see signs of reinflation. However, I am not going to overreact\nto normal month-to-month variability in the data.\n\n3\n\n\fAnd for all the fancy techniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data\nover several months. Of course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn,\ndemands that, yes, we remain data dependent but patient and cautious with the data.\nAnd the data I do see, and all what I hear, point to a steady disinflation that is already under way and\nsustained, if slow. My projections have inflation dropping below 3 percent in 2024 and leveling out at\nour 2 percent target thereafter.\nOf course, there’s much more than just the policy rate at work here. There are numerous outside factors\nthat are working in parallel with it to further push down on inflation.\nFor those in this room, I don’t think I need to do much more than to point to the bond markets as a\nproof point. Certainly, the impacts of restrictive policy on bond prices across the yield curve are exerting\ntheir own pressures — and creating their own challenges along with it.\nAnd, of course, there are also the tighter overall credit conditions that have existed since the collapses\nof Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic several months ago. In speaking with contacts\nover the summer, I heard that even while activity slowed, credit quality did not lag overall. Business\nlending continued for many, though it was reported to me that many borrowers were focusing more on\nfinancing for their “must haves,” not their “like to haves.”\nThere are other pressures that must be considered, too. The continued turmoil in the labor market is\nlikely to similarly exert downward pressure on the economy — not just in the loss of overall economic\nactivity but in the immediate impact on consumer spending as striking workers go without their usual\nwages.\nThere’s also another elephant in this room, and that is the resumption of student loan payments. Again,\nwe do not yet know the full scope this will have on consumer spending and savings, but we know that\nwe do not know, so I am keeping a close eye on the matter.\nAnd finally, we cannot forget that events around the world, and the uncertainty they bring, can have a\nreal impact on our economy here at home. We are all watching, and in many cases praying about, the\n4\n\n\ftragic situation in Israel and the Middle East, stemming from those recent terrorist attacks. And there is\nstill Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Those are just two examples.\nSo, taking this all together, the picture painted is one that, I believe, shows that allowing the policy rate\nto remain steady is the prudent position.\n“Well, Pat, that’s all well and good, but when are rates going to come down,” I hear you ask.\nI wish I had an answer for you, but at this moment, I don’t. My forecasts are based on what I know as of\nnow. And as time goes by, as adjustments are completed, as new data emerge, and as we gain\nadditional insight on the underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them, my time\nframes. So, as inexact as the term “higher for longer” sounds and is, it’s the best way I have to answer\nthat question. Rates will need to stay high for a while.\nIt is not just the data that will signal to me when the time comes to adjust policy either way, but what I\nalso hear from contacts and through outreach.\nAnd I must note that while I really do not expect it, should inflation rebound, I would not hesitate to\nsupport further rate increases as our objective to return inflation to target is, simply, not negotiable.\nAgain, I say this with all the forecast data I have at this moment. And at this moment, I expect the\neconomy’s overall resilience to continue. Its underpinnings remain strong.\nFor starters, GDP growth has been outperforming estimates from earlier this year, and I do expect GDP\ngains to continue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But do not conflate a\nmore moderate rate of GDP growth as a contraction. I do not anticipate a recession.\nOn the jobs front, I anticipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — which is just slightly\nabove where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5 percent,\nbefore heading back toward 4 percent in 2025.\n\n5\n\n\fThis path would put the unemployment figure in line with the natural rate of unemployment, or that\ntheoretical level where labor market conditions support stable 2 percent inflation.\nNow, this does not mean that I expect mass layoffs. I do not.\nFirst, we have seen months where the unemployment rate increased because more workers moved off\nthe sidelines and back into the labor force. I expect us to continue to have such months. And second, I\nhave to also balance the soft data I receive from my discussions with contacts — and many have related\nthat, given how hard they’ve worked to find the workers they currently have, they are doing all they can\nto hold onto them.\nThe economic indicators tracked by the Philadelphia Fed also give me reason to feel positive about the\npath forward.\nAmong our most closely watched indicators are the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing business\noutlook surveys conducted with firms throughout the Third District. The latest Manufacturing Business\nOutlook Survey came out this morning. Now, while firms in both of the most recent surveys noted\ndeclines in month-over-month activity, the six-month outlooks reported in each remained optimistic\noverall.\nIn addition, we also publish a monthly summary metric of economic activity: the State Coincident\nIndexes. And in each state in our region — Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — the overall longrange trend continues to be positive.\nSuch optimism is also borne out in some of the other hard data points we look at, including business\nformation. And here I would note, specifically, that the numbers of applications for high-propensity\nbusinesses — those expected to turn into firms with payroll — remain elevated across the board in the\nThird District when compared with prepandemic levels. And I also see the data showing that hotel\noccupancy rates, while not yet back to prepandemic levels, have continued to rebound.\nI do take these as promising signs.\n\n6\n\n\fOf course, there are areas in which we have some concern. And specifically, I’ll note the commercial real\nestate (CRE) sector. Office vacancy rates continue to be well above their prepandemic levels. Office\nspace net absorption rates in the Philadelphia region continue to be negative. I do have some anxiety\nthat last month’s transition of the Wanamaker Building into receivership isn’t going to be a one-off\nevent.\nAnd to be clear, to me, the issues surrounding CRE aren’t just about the investments in the buildings\nthemselves but also about the livelihoods of the businesses — especially the small businesses — which\nsurround them and which are simply not getting anywhere near the foot traffic they did just a few years\nago.\nNow, I really want to step away from this podium and get to our conversation. But before we do, let me\nto pose the following question, which has nagged at me for months now as I’ve taken in data and\nformulated my position on the future direction of monetary policy: What in the economy has\nfundamentally changed from, say, 2018 or 2019?\nIn 2018, inflation averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point and was actually below target in 2019.\nUnemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was as low as 3.5 percent, while policy\nrates peaked below 2.5 percent.\nNow, I’m not saying that we’re going to be able to exactly replicate prepandemic economic conditions.\nBut the resilience of this economy is making me rethink some of the classic models.\nAnd that’s probably a good thing. After all, I’m not a classically trained economist — by education, I’m\nan engineer. And if you know anything about engineers, we’re always willing to challenge previous\nassumptions and to look outside the box.\nAnd if there’s something else about engineers, we’re also really good at judging the limits of a system,\nand I think I’ve just about hit my limit on my prepared remarks. I am eager to get to our conversation.\nSo, Floyd, why don’t we do away with this podium and get to it.\nBut one last thing: Go Phillies!\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fPutting Research to Work So Job Quality Equals Job Quantity\nWelcome Remarks\nPeople, Possibilities, Practice: Designing a Better Future for Workers\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 18, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Philadelphia Fed.\nThank you, Susie Kendis, for that introduction and to you and your colleagues at Deloitte for yesterday’s\nconference, which laid significant groundwork for these next two days of discussions.\nI also thank our friends at Working Nation, the City of Philadelphia, and Drexel University’s Lindy\nInstitute for helping us put together this series of events.\nNow, a quick reminder of the usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThis is an exciting event for me as it gives me the opportunity to highlight some of the truly\ngroundbreaking research going on under this roof. It may be easy to think of the Federal Reserve only in\nterms of monetary policy and interest rates and such — and I honestly can’t blame you — but the work\nwe do here every day is varied, dynamic, and truly impactful as you will see.\nAs you may know, for nearly 50 years, the Federal Reserve has worked according to the dual mandate\nthat Congress handed down to us. One pillar of this dual mandate is price stability. That’s the one you\nread about most in the news as we continue our efforts to wrestle inflation back down to our 2 percent\nannual target. And as an aside, we are making steady progress, but more remains to be done.\n\n1\n\n\fThe other — equally important, if somewhat less reported — is to promote maximum employment. But\nwhat does that mean, maximum employment? Well, I look at it as a two-way proposition. It’s not just\npromoting economic conditions through which employers can open their doors for workers to come in.\nJob growth is important, but it’s not the end-all, be-all.\nFor me, maximum employment also means promoting a climate in which workers in those jobs are\ntreated with respect and dignity, and where work isn’t just something to be rewarded but something\nthat is truly rewarding. Put another way, while the quantity of available jobs is important, so, too, is the\nquality of those jobs.\nSo, it is upon the pillar of maximum employment in which we find the Worker Voices Project.\nYesterday, I published an article on the Philadelphia Fed’s website with my perspective on some of what\nthe Worker Voices Project tells us. If you have not yet done so, I do encourage you to read it — just\nmaybe not at this very moment. But allow me to give you a couple of spoilers.\nI opened my article with a direct quote from one of the many workers interviewed through the Worker\nVoices Project, who said, “I know that I can bring a lot to the table. Are you going to uphold your end of\nthe half as an employer?”\nAnd I closed the article by writing the following: “I am proud that our research is being put into action\ntoward innovations that can meet the needs of our workforce while forging the strong economy of\ntomorrow. And this research is not just going to benefit us as economists but, ultimately, more so as a\nsociety.”\nThis brings me to this event today and the further discussions that will take place tomorrow.\nAs economists, we have many tools and models through which we can study the forces that exert their\npush and pull on the labor market and those participating in it. Make no mistake, these hard data are\nimportant. Hard data give us — pun fully intended — concrete points, which, through time, we can\nidentify employment trends, identify precursors of labor force realignments, and support potential\nchanges in public policy.\n2\n\n\fFrom what I said a moment ago, the hard data tell us a lot about the quantity of jobs.\nBut even for all its strengths and directional guidance, the hard data cannot tell us what is going on at\nthe most micro level — the decisions individual workers are making about their own futures. These soft\ndata, the data reported through the Worker Voices Project, are a critically important supplement to the\nhard data. Actually, strike that, it’s not a supplement; it’s a full-fledged partner. We need to look at both,\nequally.\nAnd when looking at the Worker Voices Project, I see the means for us to coalesce around basic\nprinciples that classic economics cannot capture in a model or on a chart. This is what comes to my mind\nwhen I hear the phrase “research in action.”\nIf you don’t know, even though I sit as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed, economics wasn’t my\nfirst pursuit. By education, I’m an engineer. And if you know one thing about engineers, we cannot just\nlet things be, when we know, deep down, systems can be made more efficient, more effective, and even\nmore fair.\nThere’s nothing that an engineer enjoys more than lifting the cover and looking at what’s going on\nunderneath. And there’s nothing that an engineer enjoys less than hearing that something can’t be\nchanged because “that’s just the way we do things.”\nAnd this is what we’re doing here — we’re lifting the cover to see how we can make the labor market\nwork more efficiently, effectively, and fairly for workers. And, over the course of the next two days,\nwe’re not going to allow ourselves to be limited by the old ways of thinking.\nThat’s not being anti-employer. Far from it. As I have traveled across the Third District and talked with\nemployers, I hear directly how hard they’re working to find the employees their businesses need to be\nsuccessful — and once these employees are in, they don’t want to lose them.\n\n3\n\n\fYet, many of these employers are sticking only to the means through which they’ve attracted workers in\nthe past — namely, higher wages and more benefits. And not surprisingly, they are finding these tools\nalone aren’t as effective as they once were.\nThe Worker Voices Project, and the discussions and actionable research stemming from it, is a means\nthrough which we can provide these employers new and better tools to attract and retain workers.\nThese are the workers who can see their values reflected in those held by their employer and their value\nrewarded not just in terms of wages but in terms of being treated with dignity.\nNow, I could go on as my excitement for and belief in this transformational research is nearly\ninexhaustible — unlike attention spans. And every minute I give back is a minute we can spend hearing\nfrom the subject experts, who are doing the research, and those living it.\nSo, with that, I will yield the microphone. But, again, thank you all for coming this afternoon. I hope both\nthe rest of today’s forum and tomorrow’s working session are, like a good job, equally productive and\nrewarding.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\f“Doing Nothing” Is S�ll Doing a Lot\nNa�onal Associa�on of Corporate Directors Webinar\nNACD New Jersey and Philadelphia Chapters\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nOctober 16, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Oﬃcer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood a�ernoon, everyone.\nI appreciate that you’re all giving up part of the end of your workday for us to be together, if only\nvirtually.\nMy thanks to my good friend, Rick Mroz, for that welcome and introduc�on.\nI do believe we’re going to have a produc�ve session. But just so you all know, as much as I enjoy\nspeaking and providing my outlook, I enjoy a good conversa�on even more.\nSo, ﬁrst, let’s take a few minutes so I can give you my perspec�ve on where we are headed, and then I\nwill be more than happy to take ques�ons and hear what’s on your minds.\nBut before we get into any of that, I must begin with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express\ntoday are my own and do not necessarily reﬂect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommitee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nPut simply, this is one of those �mes where the opera�ve words are, “Pat said,” not “the Fed said.”\nNow, to begin, I’m going to ﬁrst address the two topics that I get asked about most o�en: interest rates\nand inﬂa�on. And I would guess they are the topics front and center in many of your minds as well.\n1\n\n\fA�er the FOMC’s last policy rate hike in July, I went on record with my view that, if economic and\nﬁnancial condi�ons evolved roughly as I expected they would, we could hold rates where they are. And I\nam pleased that, so far, economic and ﬁnancial condi�ons are evolving as I expected, if not perhaps even\na tad beter.\nLet’s look at the current dynamics. There is a steady, if slow, disinﬂa�on under way. Labor markets are\ncoming into beter balance. And, all the while, economic ac�vity has remained resilient.\nGiven this, I remain today where I found myself a�er July’s mee�ng: Absent a stark turnabout in the data\nand in what I hear from contacts, I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they\nare.\nIn barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by more than 5 percentage points and to its\nhighest level in more than two decades — 11 rate hikes in a span of 12 mee�ngs prior to September. We\nnot only did a lot, but we did it very fast.\nWe also turned around our balance sheet policy — and we will con�nue to �ghten ﬁnancial condi�ons\nby shrinking the balance sheet.\nThe workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some �me for the full impact of the\nhigher rates to be felt. In fact, I have heard a plea from countless contacts, asking to give them some\n�me to absorb the work we have already done.\nI agree with them. I am sure policy rates are restric�ve, and, as long they remain so, we will steadily\npress down on inﬂa�on and bring markets into a beter balance.\nHolding rates steady will let monetary policy do its work. By doing nothing, we are s�ll doing something.\nAnd I would argue we are doing quite a lot.\nHeadline PCE inﬂa�on remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year, but it is down 3\npercentage points from this �me last year. About half of that drop is due to the vola�le components of\n2\n\n\fenergy and food that, while basic necessi�es, they are typically excluded by economists in the so-called\ncore inﬂa�on rate to give a more accurate assessment of the pace of disinﬂa�on and its likely path\nforward.\nWell, core PCE inﬂa�on has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August monthly reading was its\nsmallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\nSo, yes, a steady disinﬂa�on is under way, and I expect it to con�nue. My projec�on is that inﬂa�on will\ndrop below 3 percent in 2024 and level out at our 2 percent target therea�er.\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinﬂa�on. For example, September’s CPI\nreport came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing.\nLet me be clear about two things. First, we will not tolerate a reaccelera�on in prices. But second, I do\nnot want to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices. And for all the fancy\ntechniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data over several months.\nOf course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn, demands that, yes, we\nremain data dependent but pa�ent and cau�ous with the data.\nTurning to the jobs picture, I do an�cipate na�onal unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent —\njust slightly above where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5\npercent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. That is a rate in line with what economists call\nthe natural rate of unemployment, or the theore�cal level in which labor market condi�ons support\nstable inﬂa�on at 2 percent.\nNow, that said, as you know, there are many factors that play into the calcula�on of the unemployment\nrate. For instance, we’ve seen recent months where, even as the economy added more jobs, the\nunemployment rate increased because more workers moved oﬀ the sidelines and back into the labor\nforce. There are many other dynamics at play, too, such as technological changes or public policy issues,\nlike child care or immigra�on, which directly impact employment.\n\n3\n\n\fAnd beyond the hard data, I also have to balance the so� data. For example, in my discussions with\nemployers throughout the Third District, I hear that given how hard they’ve worked to ﬁnd the workers\nthey currently have, they are doing all they can to hold onto them.\nSo, to sum up the labor picture, let me say, simply, I do not expect mass layoﬀs.\nI do expect GDP gains to con�nue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But even\nas I foresee the rate of GDP growth modera�ng, I do not see it contrac�ng. And, again, to put it simply, I\ndo not an�cipate a recession.\nLook, this economy has been nothing if not unpredictable. It has proven itself unwilling to s�ck to\ntradi�onal modeling and seems determined to not only bend some rules in one place, but to make up its\nown in another. However, as frustra�ngly unpredictable as it has been, it con�nues to move along.\nAnd this has led me to the following thought: What has fundamentally changed in the economy from,\nsay, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, inﬂa�on averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point and was actually\nbelow target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was as low as 3.5\npercent — both na�onwide and in our respec�ve states — while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent.\nNow, I’m not saying we’re going to be able to exactly replicate the prepandemic economy, but it is hard\nto ﬁnd fundamental diﬀerences. Surely, I cannot and will not minimize the immense impacts of the\npandemic on our lives and our families, nor the fact that for so many, the new normal s�ll does not feel\nnormal. From the cold lens of economics, I do not see underlying fundamental changes. I could also be\nwrong, and, trust me, that would not be the ﬁrst �me this economy has made me rethink some of the\nclassic models. We just won’t know for sure un�l we have more data to look at over �me.\nAnd then, of course, there are the economic uncertain�es — both na�onal and global — against which\nwe also must contend. The ongoing auto worker strike, among other labor ac�ons. The restart of student\nloan payments. The poten�al of a government shutdown. Fast-changing events in response to the tragic\natacks against Israel. Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Each and every one deserves a close watch.\n\n4\n\n\fThese are the broad economic signals we are picking up at the Philadelphia Fed, but I would note that\nthe regional ones we follow are also poin�ng us forward.\nFirst, while in the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent business outlook surveys, which survey manufacturing\nand nonmanufacturing ﬁrms in the Third District, month-over-month ac�vity declined, the six-month\noutlooks for each remain op�mis�c for growth.\nAnd we also publish a monthly summary metric of economic ac�vity, the State Coincident Indexes. In\nNew Jersey, the index is up slightly year over year through August, which shows generally posi�ve\ncondi�ons. However, the three-month number from June through August was down, and while both\npayroll employment and average hours worked in manufacturing increased during that �me, so did the\nunemployment rate — though a good part of that increase can be explained as more residents moved\nback into the labor force.\nAnd for those of you joining us from the western side of the Delaware River, Pennsylvania’s coincident\nindex is up more than 4 percent year over year through August and 1.7 percent since June. Payroll\nemployment was up, and the unemployment rate was down; however, the number of average hours\nworked in manufacturing decreased.\nThere are also promising signs in both states in terms of business forma�on. The number of applica�ons,\nspeciﬁcally, for high-propensity businesses — those expected to turn into ﬁrms with payroll — are\nremaining elevated compared with prepandemic levels. Again, a promising sign.\nSo, it is against this full backdrop that I have concluded that now is the �me at which the policy rate can\nremain steady. But I can hear you ask: “How long will rates need to stay high.” Well, I simply cannot say\nat this moment. My forecasts are based on what we know as of late 2023. As �me goes by, as\nadjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on the underlying trends, I may need\nto adjust my forecasts, and with them my �me frames.\nI can tell you three things about my views on future policy. First, I expect rates will need to stay high for a\nwhile.\n\n5\n\n\fSecond, the data and what I hear from contacts and outreach will signal to me when the �me comes to\nadjust policy either way. I really do not expect it, but if inﬂa�on were to rebound, I know I would not\nhesitate to support further rate increases as our objec�ve to return inﬂa�on to target is, simply, not\nnego�able.\nThird, I believe that a resolute, but pa�ent, monetary policy stance will allow us to achieve the soft\nlanding that we all wish for our economy.\nBefore I conclude and turn things over to Rick to kick oﬀ our Q&A, I do want to spend a moment on a\ntopic that he and I recently discussed, and it’s something about which I know there is generally great\ninterest: ﬁntech. In fact, I understand there is discussion about NACD hos�ng a conference on ﬁntech.\nWell, last month, we at the Philadelphia Fed hosted our Seventh Annual Fintech Conference, which\nbrought business and thought leaders together at the Bank for two days of real in-depth discussions. And\nI am extraordinarily proud of the fact that the Philadelphia Fed’s conference has emerged as one of the\npremier conferences on ﬁntech, anywhere. Not that it’s a compe��on.\nI had the pleasure of opening this year’s conference, which always puts a focus on shi�s in the ﬁntech\nlandscape. Much of this year’s conference centered around developments in digital currencies and\ncrypto — and, believe me, some of the discussions were a litle, shall we say, “spirited.” However, my\noverarching point to atendees was the following: Regardless of one’s views, whether in favor of or\nagainst such currencies, our reality requires us to move from thinking in terms of “what if” to thinking\nabout “what next.”\nIn many ways, we’re beyond the stage of thinking about crypto and digital currency and into the stage of\nhaving them as reality — just as AI has moved from being the stuﬀ of science ﬁc�on to the stuﬀ of\neveryday life. What is needed now is cri�cal thinking about what is next. And we at the Federal Reserve,\nboth here in Philadelphia and System-wide, are focused on being part of this discussion.\nWe are also focused on providing not just thought leadership but actionable leadership. For example,\nthe Fed rolled out our new FedNow instant payment service platform in July. With FedNow, we will have\na more nimble and responsive banking system.\n6\n\n\fTo be sure, FedNow is not the first instant payment system — other systems, whether operated by\nindividual banks or through third parties, have been operational for some time. But by allowing banks to\ninteract with each other quickly and efficiently to ensure one customer’s payment becomes another’s\ndeposit, we are fulfilling our role in providing a fair and equitable payment system.\nAnother area where the Fed is assuming a mantle of leadership is in quantum compu�ng, or QC, which\nhas the poten�al to revolu�onize security and problem-solving methodologies throughout the banking\nand ﬁnancial services industry. But that upside also comes with a real downside risk, should other notso-friendly actors co-opt QC for their own purposes.\nRight now, individual ins�tu�ons and other central banks globally are expanding their own research in\nQC. But just as these ins�tu�ons look to the Fed for economic leadership, so, too, are they looking to us\nfor technological leadership. So, I am especially proud that this System-wide eﬀort is being led from right\nhere at the Philadelphia Fed.\nI could go on and talk about ﬁntech for much longer. A�er all, I’m actually an engineer more than I am an\neconomist. But I know that Rick is interested in star�ng our conversa�on, and I am sure that many of you\nare ready to par�cipate.\nBut one last thought on ﬁntech — my answers today aren’t going to be generated by ChatGPT.\nOn that note, Rick, thanks for allowing me the �me to set up our discussion, and let’s start with the Q&A.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fGiving the Economy Time to Catch Its Breath\nMortgage Bankers Associa�on Annual Conven�on and Expo\nPennsylvania Conven�on Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nOctober 16, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Oﬃcer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning.\nMy thanks to the Mortgage Bankers Associa�on for the opportunity to be part of your annual conven�on\nand to Chair-elect Laura Escobar for that introduc�on.\nAnd, with that, welcome to the City of Philadelphia and the Third Federal Reserve District.\nI am honored to share this podium with my fellow speakers and to provide my outlook for economic\ncondi�ons moving forward.\nBut before I do that, there is one piece of business to which I must atend, and that is the usual Federal\nReserve disclaimer: The views I express are my own and do not necessarily reﬂect those of anyone else\non the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr, if I may give the Cliﬀs Notes version: When recoun�ng my remarks, please just say, “Pat said,” not\n“The Fed said.”\nLet me put it plainly: I stand here this morning fully aware of the mood in this room. And I am also fully\naware of the way the ac�ons we on the FOMC have taken over the past 18 months in our eﬀorts to tame\ninﬂa�on and get it back down to our 2 percent annual target have, in their own way, contributed to the\ncurrent mortgage climate.\n1\n\n\fAs you know, one of the pillars of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is price stability — ge�ng inﬂa�on\nback to that 2 percent annual target. And while I am sensi�ve to the impacts higher policy rates have\nhad, that goal remains job one.\nThroughout the summer, I traveled with my team throughout the Third District — as we do every year —\nto meet with community bankers and other contacts in their home communi�es, to talk about\ncondi�ons on the ground, to hear their perspec�ves and concerns, and to see ﬁrsthand the impacts of\nmonetary policy on the local level.\nSuﬃce it to say, the impact of rising mortgage rates was something that took front and center in nearly\nevery conversa�on. In fact, the climate could be crystalized in seven words, which one of those contacts\nsaid to me recently: “There are no ﬁrst-�me home buyers.”\nThat’s a stark assessment. And it is one I take without further parsing. The housing market is key for our\neconomy overall, not to men�on its greater importance for our society as a whole in ensuring that every\nfamily has access to a safe and aﬀordable place to call home.\nThe rise in interest rates not only raised borrowing costs on those looking to purchase a home, but it also\ncontributed to the contrac�on of inventory. It is completely understandable that current homeowners\nwon’t put their houses on the market and step away from their current low-rate mortgages.\nAnd it is just simple market dynamics that a lack of inventory would elevate prices overall, further\nlessening the depth of the pool of poten�al buyers.\nOf course, the other side of this coin is new home sales, which both the hard data show and our contacts\nrelay are trending upward throughout this period. This, too, makes sense from the view of market\ndynamics — the way around contrac�ng inventory in exis�ng homes is to purchase a home that didn’t\nexist before. And we know these homes o�en come with atrac�ve ameni�es and features an exis�ng\nhome may not, including being more energy eﬃcient and decreasing the cost of keeping that home\ncomfortable.\n\n2\n\n\fBut, again, these sales cannot fully make up for the overall slowdown in one of the economy’s most\nimpac�ul sectors.\nNow, I’m not going to stand here and provide a lecture on things you all know. And I am not going to\nminimize the work we’ve done to get inﬂa�on moving back toward target. What I want to provide you\nwith this morning is where I see things moving forward.\nTo start, I remain in the place where I have found myself for the past several months: Absent a stark turn\nin what I see in the data and hear from contacts, and audiences like you, I believe that we are at the\npoint where we can hold rates where they are.\nA�er our last policy rate hike in July, I went on the record with my view that, if economic and ﬁnancial\ncondi�ons evolve roughly as I expect, we can hold rates where they are. And, so far, economic and\nﬁnancial condi�ons are evolving as I expected, perhaps even a tad beter.\nDisinﬂa�on is under way, labor markets are coming into beter balance, and economic ac�vity continues\nto be resilient.\nLooking back, we did a lot, and we did it very fast. In fact, I heard that summa�on from some of your\npeers throughout the summer. In barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by more than 5\npercentage points and to its highest level in more than two decades. We also turned around our balance\nsheet policy, and we turned it around fast.\nThe workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some �me for the full impact of the\nhigher rates to be fully absorbed. What I have heard this summer is an appeal to give you and your\ncustomers the thing you wanted most: �me to catch your breath.\nBut my argument is that by doing nothing, we are doing something. And I think we are doing quite a lot.\nLook where we are — headline PCE inﬂa�on remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year,\nbut it is down 3 percentage points from this �me last year.\n\n3\n\n\fAbout half of that drop is due to the vola�le components of energy and food, so despite both of these\nbeing basic necessi�es of life, economists typically exclude them in the so-called core inﬂa�on rate,\nwhich gives a more accurate assessment of the pace of disinﬂa�on and its likely path forward.\nBut even that core measure of PCE inﬂa�on has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August\nmonthly reading was its smallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\nAnd again, I’m telling you something you already know, the rate of inﬂa�on in housing prices is similarly\ndown from its peak levels.\nI do see a steady disinﬂa�on under way, and I expect it to con�nue, with inﬂa�on dropping below 3\npercent in 2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent target therea�er.\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinﬂa�on. For example, September’s CPI\nreport came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing.\nLet me be clear about two things. First, I will not tolerate a reaccelera�on in prices. But second, I do not\nwant to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices.\nAnd for all the fancy techniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data\nover several months. Of course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn,\ndemands that, yes, we remain data dependent but pa�ent and cau�ous with the data.\nAs long as policy rates are restric�ve, we will keep steadily pressing down on inﬂa�on and bringing\nmarkets into beter balance.\nAnd the policy rate has outside factors that are working in parallel to further push down on inﬂa�on. For\nexample, while we are now six months past the spring banking turmoil, the �ghter credit condi�ons that\nhave existed since then are having the impact of higher interest rates without requiring them to be so.\n\n4\n\n\fAddi�onally, the current turmoil in labor markets is likely to similarly exert downward pressure on the\neconomy — not just in the loss of overall economic ac�vity but in the immediate impact on consumer\nspending as striking auto workers, for example, are forgoing their usual wages.\nOn top of this, we can also add the resump�on of student loan payments. Again, we do not yet know\nwhat impact this will have on consumer spending and savings, but I do expect it to be impac�ul, if not\nsigniﬁcant.\nSo, it is against this backdrop that I believe the prudent posi�on to be in is one in which the policy rate\ncan remain steady. Alas, you may have no�ced that I didn’t tell you how long rates will need to stay high.\nUnfortunately, I simply cannot tell you at this moment. My forecasts are based on what I know as of\n10:30 a.m. on Monday, October 16, 2023.\nAs �me goes by, as adjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on the\nunderlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them my �me frames. But, as for future\npolicy, I can tell you I do subscribe to the moniker, “higher for longer.” I didn’t coin the phrase, but my\nexpecta�on is that rates will need to stay high for a while.\nIt is not just the data that will signal to me when the �me comes to adjust policy either way, but what I\nalso hear from contacts and through outreach.\nA�er all, my discussions over the summer helped lead me to my current posi�on. And while I really do\nnot expect it, if inﬂa�on were to rebound, I know I would not hesitate to support further rate increases\nas our objec�ve to return inﬂa�on to target is, simply, not nego�able.\nMeanwhile, I con�nue to see strong underpinnings for our economy overall. This economy is proving to\nbe nothing if not resilient. I expect this to con�nue.\nGDP growth is outperforming es�mates from earlier this year. I do expect GDP gains to con�nue through\nthe end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But do not conﬂate a more moderate rate of GDP\ngrowth as a contrac�on. Put simply: I do not an�cipate a recession.\n5\n\n\fOf course, to aﬀord a home, a family needs a job to provide the means through which to purchase it. I\ncon�nue to an�cipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — just slightly above where we\nare now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak around 4.5 percent before heading back\ntoward 4 percent in 2025.\nThis path would put the unemployment ﬁgure in line with the natural rate of unemployment, or that\ntheore�cal level where labor market condi�ons support stable 2 percent inﬂa�on.\nNow, let me be clear about one thing: This does not mean that I expect mass layoﬀs.\nThere are many factors that play into the calcula�on of the unemployment rate itself. For instance, we’ve\nhad recent months in which, even as the economy added more jobs, the unemployment rate increased\nbecause more workers moved oﬀ the sidelines and back into the labor force.\nI also have to balance the so� data. For example, I have heard from employers — both directly and\nthrough contacts — that given how hard they’ve worked to ﬁnd the workers they currently have, they\nare doing all they can to hold onto them.\nThen there are also factors that have a very persistent impact on the underlying dynamics of the\neconomy and the labor market — technological change, immigra�on, child care all can shape or reshape\nlabor markets. And some or all of these factors can be at play simultaneously.\nThe amount of upheaval we’ve felt in our economy in a rela�vely short period of �me may lead some to\nbelieve that there are fundamental changes taking place. I would argue that’s only natural, given what\nwe’ve all been through since March 2020.\nThe pandemic was such a large health and economic crisis that it marks a “before” and an “a�er” in our\nminds and lives, not the least of which was the tremendous loss of life that touched so many of us very\nclosely. I cannot blame anyone who says that the new normal s�ll does not feel normal.\n\n6\n\n\fBut let me conclude by posing the following rhetorical ques�on: What in the economy has\nfundamentally changed from, say, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, inﬂa�on averaged 2 percent almost to the\ndecimal point and was actually below target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both\nyears and was as low as 3.5 percent, while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent.\nNow, I’m not saying that we’re going to be able to exactly replicate prepandemic economic condi�ons.\nBut the resilience of this economy is making me rethink some of the classic models.\nI have been wrong before, and this economy is challenging us with its willingness to do what the\nmodels say it should not and cannot be able to do. But, as they say, every challenge comes with\nopportunity.\nOpportunity to look at the data in diﬀerent ways. And opportunity to get out and to speak with contacts\nfor the all-important so� data, which, so o�en, captures nuances that the hard data cannot.\nAll of this — the hard data and the so� data — must be viewed together. And when it is, I believe my\nposi�on on holding the policy rate steady is the prudent one to take.\nI believe such a resolute, but pa�ent, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the so t landing\nthat we all wish for our economy. And with that landing, we’ll be able to see our economy take oﬀ\nagain, but this �me on a clear and stable path forward.\nI thank you all for the opportunity to be with you today. I wish you the very best for a produc�ve\nconven�on.\nThank you.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Execu�ve Oﬃcer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning, everyone.\nFirst, to President Mike Quaranta and the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, thank you for invi�ng\nme for what has become our annual opportunity to be together — even if just virtually.\nAnd, to each of you with us, thanks for allowing me to be part of your Friday.\nI know we have a lot of ground to cover and only an hour in which to do it. And as much as I enjoy\nproviding you with my outlook, I much more enjoy the ability to drill deeper into issues through a\nconversa�on. So, let’s just get right into this.\nOf course, I must begin with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do\nnot necessarily reﬂect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nOr, as I’ve become fond of saying, when you’re telling your colleagues about this morning’s conversa�on,\nyou can just say, “Pat said,” not “the Fed said.”\nNow, as you can imagine, the two topics I get asked about most are interest rates and inﬂa�on. And that\nmakes sense, given the impact they have on the decisions made by both businesses and families. So, I’ll\nstart there.\n1\n\n\fA�er the last policy rate hike in July, I went on the record with my view that, if economic and ﬁnancial\ncondi�ons evolved roughly as I expected, we could hold rates where they are. And while I have been\nproven wrong in less than two months before, I am happy to say that so far economic and ﬁnancial\ncondi�ons are evolving as I expected, if not perhaps even a tad beter.\nDisinﬂa�on is under way. Economic ac�vity has been resilient. Labor markets are coming into beter\nbalance. Moreover, these condi�ons aren’t just where I see the na�onal economy but also our regional\neconomy and, speciﬁcally for today’s discussion, Delaware’s. And I’ll note those points in turn.\nSo, I remain today where I ﬁrst announced myself in early August: Absent a stark turn in what I see in the\ndata and hear from contacts, both in one-on-one conversa�ons and in forums like this, I believe that we\nare at the point where we can hold rates where they are.\nLook, we did a lot, and we did it very fast. In barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by\nmore than 5 percentage points and to its highest level in more than two decades — 11 rate hikes in a\nspan of 12 mee�ngs prior to September.\nWe also turned around our balance sheet policy, and we turned it around fast — and we con�nue to\n�ghten ﬁnancial condi�ons by shrinking the balance sheet.\nBut the workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some �me for the full impact of the\nhigher rates to be felt. Holding rates steady will let monetary policy do its work. I am sure policy rates are\nrestric�ve, and as long they remain so, we will steadily press down on inﬂa�on and bring markets into a\nbeter balance.\nBy doing nothing, we are s�ll doing something. And, actually, we are doing quite a lot.\nWe are also giving ourselves a chance to navigate some of the current uncertainty — labor strikes, oil\nprices, and the not-fully-exorcised specter of a government shutdown included.\n\n2\n\n\fI am more and more conﬁdent that not only is monetary policy currently working, but it will con�nue to\nwork. Headline PCE inﬂa�on remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year, but it is down 3\npercentage points from this �me last year. About half of that drop is due to the vola�le components of\nenergy and food. So, despite both of those being basic necessi�es of life, economists typically exclude\nthem in the so-called core inﬂa�on rate, which gives a more accurate assessment of the pace of\ndisinﬂa�on and its likely path forward.\nWell, core PCE inﬂa�on has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August monthly reading was its\nsmallest month-over-month increase since 2020. So, yes, I do see a steady disinﬂa�on under way, and I\nexpect it to con�nue, with inﬂa�on dropping below 3 percent in 2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent\ntarget therea�er.\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinﬂa�on. For example, yesterday’s release\nof September’s CPI report came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing. Let me be\nclear about two things. First, we will not tolerate a reaccelera�on in prices. But second, I do not want to\noverreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices. And for all the fancy techniques, the best\nway to separate a signal from noise remains to average data over several months. Of course, to do so,\nyou need several months of data to start with, which, in turn, demands that, yes, we remain data\ndependent but pa�ent and cau�ous with the data.\nMeanwhile, I con�nue to see GDP growth that is outperforming es�mates from earlier this year. This\neconomy is proving to be nothing if not resilient. I do expect GDP gains to con�nue through the end of\n2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But even as I foresee the rate of GDP growth modera�ng, I do\nnot see it contrac�ng. I do not an�cipate a recession.\nIn Delaware, the signals point in the same forward direc�on. And, in fact, business forma�on in\nDelaware, including for high-propensity businesses, remains strong, having risen con�nually since the\npandemic.\nDelaware’s Coincident Index, the Philadelphia Fed’s summary metric of economic ac�vity, increased 3.3\npercent year over year according to August data, reﬂec�ng generally posi�ve condi�ons. And, in fact,\nDelaware’s three-month increase of 0.6 percent matched the na�onal rate of increase. In the\n3\n\n\fPhiladelphia Fed’s most recent business outlook surveys, which survey manufacturing and\nnonmanufacturing ﬁrms in the Third District, including Delaware, ﬁrms overall reported declines in the\ncurrent month, but their six-month outlooks are op�mis�c for growth.\nRecognizing the importance of tourism to Delaware, I do note that the number of summer overnight\ntourist stays captured by the Rehoboth Beach–Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce showed\naccommoda�on room counts down from last year’s high levels between Memorial Day through Labor\nDay. However, we know there is probably much inﬂuencing these numbers beyond inﬂa�on or other\neconomic factors, including the weather.\nAll this aside, I fully recognize and appreciate these challenges that monetary policy is presen�ng to you\nand your businesses.\nThere are outside factors — factors that bring uncertainty with them — which con�nue to parallel the\nmore restric�ve stance we have pursued through the FOMC. For example, while we are now six months\npast the spring banking turmoil, the impact of that episode on credit markets is s�ll being felt; this is not\nnew to many of you.\nOur contacts throughout the banking sector con�nue to report �ghter credit condi�ons, which\nessen�ally have the impact of higher rates without requiring them to be so.\nAs I have spoken with contacts throughout the Third District this summer, I have heard from across\nindustry sectors of the challenges presented by both rates and current condi�ons in access to capital —\nfrom banking, to retail, to agriculture and manufacturing, and everyone in between.\nI know the impact the current climate is also having in the residen�al real estate sector, as higher\nmortgage rates have constricted inventory, which has, in turn, led to increasing prices and a shallowing\nof the pool of prospec�ve buyers, not just in Delaware but throughout the region and na�on.\nIn consumer ﬁnance, which I know is a par�cularly important sector for Delaware, there is data we\nfollow closely. So, we do take note that while the number of open bankcard accounts is up nearly 6\n\n4\n\n\fpercent, year over year, the rate of growth in origina�ons is down during that same �me span through\nJune, according to the latest available data.\nAnd we do pay aten�on to the fact that outstanding balances are up more than 15 percent year over\nyear as of August, while more consumers are pushing their payments forward, as evidenced by both the\nnearly 6 percent increase in the number of outstanding accounts and the increase in delinquency rates.\nAnd in Delaware, the 30-day delinquency rate in mortgages has been trending upward and now exceeds\nprepandemic levels — 2.4 percent of ac�ve loans today versus 2.2 percent in February 2020.\nAddi�onally, the current turmoil in labor markets is likely to similarly exert downward pressure on\nac�vity. I would say this is perhaps most notable among the auto worker strike, given the enormous\nimpact of that industry on our overall economy. It’s an industry that isn’t composed of just the direct\nmanufacturing of cars and trucks but also the business lines of countless downstream component\nmanufacturers and suppliers.\nThere is also the immediate impact of the strike on consumer spending and economic ac�vity, as striking\nworkers are forgoing their usual wages.\nIt is obviously too soon to tell the overall impact of this strike, as well as the ongoing labor ac�on in the\nentertainment industry and elsewhere, on GDP or inﬂa�on, but I suspect it will become obvious in the\ncoming months’ worth of data.\nAnd while an agreement was reached to temporarily keep the federal government open and running, we\ndon’t know what will happen four weeks from now when this agreement expires.\nFinally, I also believe this month’s restart of student loan payments will have a further dampening eﬀect\non consumer spending. How much so, however, remains to be seen.\nTurning to the jobs picture, I do an�cipate na�onal unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent —\njust slightly above where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak around 4.5\npercent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. That is a rate in line with what economists call\n5\n\n\fthe natural rate of unemployment, or the theore�cal level where labor market condi�ons support stable\ninﬂa�on of 2 percent.\nNow, before you all post “Pat says unemployment is going up” on your social media feeds, let me be\nclear about one thing: This does not mean that I expect mass layoﬀs.\nThere are many factors that play into the calcula�on of the unemployment rate itself. For instance, we’ve\nhad recent months where, even as the economy added more jobs, the unemployment rate increased\nbecause more workers moved oﬀ the sidelines and back into the labor force.\nAnd, beyond the hard data, I also have to balance the so� data. For example, employers throughout the\nThird District have told me that given how hard it has been to ﬁnd the workers they currently have, they\nare doing all they can to keep them.\nFor Delaware, the jobs picture remains consistent: Three straight months of labor force and household\njob gains have brought the state’s unemployment rate closer to that of the na�on than at any point in\nthe prior two years. Jobs numbers in major sectors, including construc�on, ﬁnance, and professional\nservices, are all above where they were in February 2020.\nI would also speciﬁcally note the nearly 9 percent year-over-year increase in jobs in the leisure and\nhospitality sector is back to around prepandemic levels.\nSurely, the pandemic was such a large health and economic crisis that it marks a “before” and “a�er” in\nour minds and lives, not the least of which was the tremendous loss of life that touched so many of us\nvery closely. It was a shock, in every sense of the word. To so many, the new normal s�ll does not feel\nnormal. Again, the pandemic is likely to be a deﬁning event for the genera�ons that experienced it. This\nis true for families and businesses.\nBut, having said that, allow me to pose the following ﬁnal thought: What has fundamentally changed in\nthe economy from, say, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, inﬂa�on averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point\nand was actually below target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was\nas low as 3.5 percent na�onwide and in Delaware, while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent. From the\n6\n\n\fcold lens of economics, I do not see the fundamental changes that would call for large changes in natural\nrates.\nBut I could also be wrong, and, trust me, that would not be the ﬁrst �me this economy has made me\nrethink some of the classic models. We just won’t know for sure un�l we have more data to look at over\n�me.\nSo, it is against this broad backdrop that I believe the prudent posi�on is one in which the policy rate can\nremain steady. Alas, you may have no�ced that I didn’t tell you how long rates will need to stay high.\nAnd, my apologies, I simply cannot tell you at this moment. My forecasts are based on what we know as\nof late 2023. As �me goes by, as adjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on\nthe underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them my �me frames.\nI can tell you three things on my views on future policy. First, I do subscribe to the new moniker, “higher\nfor longer.” I didn’t coin it, but my expecta�on is that rates will need to stay high for a while.\nSecond, the data and what I hear from contacts and outreach, will signal to me when the �me comes to\nadjust policy either way. I really do not expect it, but if inﬂa�on were to rebound, I know I would have\nno hesitancy to support further rate increases as our objec�ve to return inﬂa�on to target is, simply,\nnot nego�able.\nThird, I believe that a resolute, but pa�ent, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the so\nlanding that we all wish for our economy.\nAnd I think that is a good place for me to land my remarks, so we can get to have a conversa�on.\nMike, thanks for allowing me the �me, and let’s start our Q&A.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fFintech: Ask “What Next?” Not “What If?”\nThe Seventh Annual Fintech Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual/in-person)\nSeptember 7, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to this latest installment of what is quickly becoming not just\none of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s premier conferences but one of the premier\nconferences on fintech, period.\nEven though this one is a home game for me, so to speak, I still must preface my remarks with the\nstandard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr, as I like to put it, when you are recounting my remarks, just say, “Pat said.” Don’t say, “the Fed\nsaid.”\nWe have a full house here at the Philadelphia Fed, and more than 1,000 others joining us virtually. While\nthis is only slightly fewer people than Taylor Swift and Beyoncé drew to Philadelphia, it is an incredible\nnumber that speaks to much more than the expanding interest in fintech but also to the efforts of those\nwho put this conference together.\nAnd with that, I must give my thanks to Julapa Jagtiani who leads this effort. She is so much more than\njust a terrific introductory speaker. Julapa truly is the heart of this conference and a valuable source of\ninformation and contacts on a wide range of fintech topics, concerns, and approaches.\nI also wish to thank our panelists and speakers, several of whom I am proud to call my colleagues within\nthe Federal Reserve System, along with all the organizing partners of this year’s conference. This truly is\na strong team.\n1\n\n\fAnd, of course, my thanks to each of you for joining us, whether in person or online.\nNow, this is a conference to which I always look forward to attending. After all, by education, I’m an\nengineer even more than I am an economist. So, any forum that stands at the nexus of these two\ndisciplines is enough to pique my interest.\nAs an economist, and especially as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed, my goal is to ensure a\nstable economy that provides opportunities for everyone to grow and succeed. As an engineer, and\nspecifically as a civil engineer, my goal is to ensure a safe, reliable, and stable infrastructure, which\nprovides opportunities for all communities to grow and succeed.\nAnd I am far from the first person to recognize this important interdisciplinary connection. In 1917, the\nthen-director of the College of Engineering at Northwestern University, John F. Hayford, wrote an essay\nin the Journal of Political Economy titled, fittingly enough, “The Relation of Engineering to Economics,”\nwhich contains the following:\nEconomics and engineering are closely related. Economics has been defined as the\nsocial science of earning a living. With the same appropriateness, engineering may be\ndefined to be physical science applied to helping groups … to make a better living. 1\nIf you drill down below the surface of this statement, it becomes clear that both economists and\nengineers are looking for ways to make systems stronger, more equitable, and more efficient. And we\ncan see throughout history the advances in civil engineering which brought about both economic and\nsocietal advances.\nWe can chart the progress from the days of siting cities within sheltered harbors or along navigable\nrivers and lakes, to the digging of canals and the laying of railroad tracks, which allowed for the siting of\nnew cities; to the advent of the automobile and the airplane, which drastically shrunk distances; to the\n\n1\n\nHayford, John F. “The Relation of Engineering to Economics,” Journal of Political Economy 25:1 (1917).\n\n2\n\n\fcreation of the microchip, which enabled the birth of the Internet and e-commerce; and, yes, fintech,\nwhich render one’s location almost meaningless.\nWell, the same progress can be charted through our understanding and conceptualization of\nmoney. The barter system limited transactions to those in which two parties could come to agreement\n— I happen to have what you want at the moment you have what I want. The advent of cash, from\ncowry shells to paper notes, meant that anyone who held those commodities would be in equal\nstanding with the next person holding the same, making markets run more efficiently and fairly.\nBut now our concept of money is changing. We no longer need to hold actual notes when electronic\nbank statements tell us how much is in our accounts and any number of instant payment apps on our\nsmartphones allow us to move virtual money to practically anyone in any corner of the world, again,\nrendering our locations practically meaningless.\nYet, we still call a transaction made through code merely representing paper notes a cash transaction.\nLikewise, our e-wallets hold “credit cards” that aren’t cards at all, just graphical representations. And the\ndevelopment of cryptocurrencies and stablecoin is forcing us to further rethink our relationship with,\nand the nature and future of, cash.\nThese changes come in some ways for the better, and in some that should raise concerns. Everyone\nhere recognizes that fintech presents not just opportunities but also challenges, and that we will not\nultimately succeed if we only focus on the former and ignore the latter.\nSo, how do we view these innovations? How do we ensure adequate understanding of their risks and\nbenefits? And how should public policy and regulation address these as they pose both benefits and\nrisks to consumers and the economy at large?\nThese are just a few of the questions swirling around the topic of fintech, which bring us to today and\nthis conference.\n\n3\n\n\fBut the biggest question of all is not “what if” but “what next”? This is the big question that will be in\nthe background of every conversation over these two days. And my hope is that these conversations will\nkeep us moving toward the answer.\nWe are witnessing a technological revolution through AI, which holds tremendous promise for\nincreasing productivity and allowing for more decisions to be made in real time.\nAs an increasing number of institutions turn to AI-powered chatbots, the need for us to continue finetuning and securing this technology only increases. A recent story 2 in the New York Times highlighted a\nLas Vegas conference at which white-hat hackers were asked to help uncover vulnerabilities in the\nsafeguards of AI chatbots. And many found ways to trick these chatbots into making misleading,\nunethical, and potentially dangerous statements.\nIt’s not hard to move from this situation to one of malicious hackers exposing security flaws to exploit\nunsuspecting customers at a financial institution into giving up sensitive identifying information. This is\nan instance where our ability to keep focused on what may be next will also ensure consumer\nconfidence.\nAnd we at the Federal Reserve, both here in Philadelphia and System-wide, are going to remain focused\non doing our part. For example, July saw the rollout of the new FedNow instant payment service\nplatform. With FedNow, we will have a more nimble and responsive banking system. Within the Third\nDistrict, we continue working with our banking partners to encourage their participation.\nCertainly, the Federal Reserve is not first past the post in creating an instant payment system — other\nsystems, whether operated by individual banks or through third parties, have been operational for some\ntime. But by allowing banks to interact with each other to ensure one customer’s payment quickly and\nefficiently becomes another’s deposit, the Federal Reserve is fulfilling its role to provide a fair and\nequitable payment system.\n\nSarah Kessler and Tiffany Hsu, “When Hackers Descended to Test A.I., They Found Flaws Aplenty,” New York\nTimes, August 16, 2023.\n2\n\n4\n\n\fAnother area where the Fed is providing thought leadership is in quantum computing, or QC. And I am\nespecially proud that this System-wide effort is being led from right here at the Philadelphia Fed.\nQuantum computing has the potential to revolutionize security and problem-solving methodologies\nthroughout the banking and financial services industry. Right now, individual institutions and other\ncentral banks globally are expanding their own research into QC. And just as these institutions look to\nthe Fed for economic leadership, so, too, are they looking to us for technological leadership.\nQC holds tremendous promise for expanding capabilities far beyond those that our current systems\nallow. But we also know QC could allow for nefarious actors to pose a truly global cybersecurity threat\n— such as by hacking encryption algorithms. And while there is noted progress in quantum-resilient\nencryption, as a banking regulator, ever-present technological change means we cannot take our eyes\noff the ball.\nThese examples are why the Fed will also continue its efforts to provide leadership in the areas of\nfinancial literacy and education — including the publications and materials we have made available for\neducators to take into their classrooms — to give consumers the tools they will need to navigate these\nnew waters, make smart decisions, and protect their own futures.\nThankfully, we are not alone in any of these efforts. Throughout the financial system are numerous\npartners — public and private sector alike, inside this room and watching online — who understand the\nimportance of making sure we get the correct answer to the question, “what next?”\nAnd, as it just so happens, one of these partners is the subject of our first Fireside Chat — Rohit Chopra,\ndirector of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\nThroughout his tenure leading the CFPB, and before it as a member of the Federal Trade Commission,\nDirector Chopra has focused on issues of fraud prevention and economic and financial fairness.\nI am also honored to welcome him as he happens to be an alum of the Wharton School of the University\nof Pennsylvania, which is not only one of our conference’s organizing partners, but where I also hung my\nhat as dean for many years in my prior life in academia.\n5\n\n\fAnd leading the discussion will be the director of the Digital Assets Policy Project at Harvard University’s\nKennedy School of Government, Tim Massad.\nIn addition to authoring numerous articles on crypto and financial regulation, Tim served as chairman of\nthe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission — a tenure that brought him front and center with\nnumerous fintech issues — and as assistant secretary for Financial Stability at the United States\nTreasury.\nWith that, it’s time to get this seventh Fintech Conference formally started.\nSo, what next?\nWell, at this microphone, it’s the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThank you very much, Tameshia, for leading that enlightening discussion, and thank you to Rebecca,\nDavid, and Johnny for sharing your stories and insights.\nAnd, of course, thank you to Fed Communities and my colleagues from throughout the System —\nincluding Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who we heard from earlier — for their partnership in the\n\nWorker Voices Project.\nTo be sure, we’re at a watershed moment in our economy. I’m not just talking about the fight against\ninflation, in which we’re making progress.\nIt is a watershed moment in the labor market as well, especially for those of us who look at data and try\nto interpret their meaning. But numbers have two inherent problems. First, the numbers we get are\nalways backward looking, a snapshot from an earlier time. Second, the numbers blur the faces and\nvoices of those they seek to capture; they can only tell us so much.\nThis is where discussions like this and, more specifically, efforts like the Worker Voices Project are so\nessential. For our economy at this moment, it is important for those of us who hold a responsibility for\npromoting full employment and fostering economic opportunity to know, in real time, why workers are\nmaking the decisions they are, especially workers either employed in low-wage positions or who do not\nhave a college degree.\n\n1\n\n\fAnd I also would suggest there are important messages that employers would be wise to heed\nconcerning the kind of workplace they may need to create to attract the workforce they will need to be\nsuccessful.\nBy education, I’m a civil engineer, even more than an economist. If you know anything about civil\nengineers, we’re always looking for ways to make things stronger, better, and more resilient. For me,\nthis includes our economy.\nAs we have heard from today’s discussion, the factors going into the decisions made by workers of\nwhere to work, when to work, or whether to leave the work they have previously known to blaze an\nentirely new path — like David has — are increasingly complex. And we oversimplify these complexities\nat our own peril, whether as policymakers or employers.\nCertainly, the pandemic did not create these complexities. As long as there has been work, workers have\nmade decisions about their place and role in the economy, based on a number of factors. And workers\ntoday have more choices before them. The pandemic served as a breaking point for all of these stresses\n— at few other times in history have so many seemingly come to the same conclusions about their own\nfuture in the workforce.\nThey want to be treated with respect and dignity.\nThey want to the opportunity to gain new skills that will provide them with upward mobility.\nThey don’t want a job that doesn’t just get them through the day, but the opportunity to create a\nsatisfying and high-quality career.\nThey want managers who recognize that they, like them, have families and dreams outside of work and\nstrive to ensure an appropriate work–life balance.\nThe expectation of workers is that they will be treated as individuals. And this is especially true for\nworkers in jobs at the lower ranges of the wage scale or those without degrees. Jobs are not one-size-\n\n2\n\n\ffits-all, and neither are workers. Hiring processes may be more automated, but no worker wants to be\ntreated like an automaton.\nAnd the Worker Voices Project is providing the data that put this reality into greater focus and\nperspective.\nAs a result, many of us who have studied economics are having to rethink some of the premises we had\npreviously relied upon. But that’s probably a good thing. Despite what many of us were taught in Econ\n101, the study of economics is not all straight lines and straightforward conclusions. Sometimes the\neconomy, and those contributing to it, not only bend long-established rules but contribute to the\ncreation of new ones in the process.\nWe appear to be at that kind of moment now, and the research in the Worker Voices Project is\ncontributing to this new way of thinking. Which is good, because if one thing is now crystal clear, it is\nthat workers no longer want to be treated merely as a plot point on a graph.\nFor us as policymakers, the soft data provided by Worker Voices are equally important as, if not perhaps\neven more important than, numbers-driven hard data in getting a full understanding of our economic\nsituation.\nI am excited not just about this report, but for the research that is going to grow out of it. The more we\ncan bring the examples outlined in the Worker Voices report into our way of thinking, the better our\nchances of creating a strong, growing, and more inclusive American economy.\nSo, when I hear someone utter the apocryphal question, “Why doesn’t anyone want to work anymore?”\nmy response is to ask in return, “What are you doing in your workplace to make them want to work for\nyou?” and to point them to the Worker Voices Project.\nAgain, I thank our panelists and everyone who contributed to today’s webinar. And I thank all of you\nwatching for spending part of your afternoon with us.\nWhitney, I’ll now hand the program back to you.\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fOn the Flight Path to the Soft Landing\nPhiladelphia Business Journal’s State of the Economy\nPhiladelphia, PA\nAugust 8, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you, Sandy, for that welcome and introduction.\nMy thanks to the Philadelphia Business Journal for bringing us together, and I must give recognition in\nabsentia to Editor-in-Chief Ryan Sharrow for reaching out and inviting me to be with you.\nI also must give thanks to City Winery for hosting us this morning. I do note with some disappointment\nthat it is only 8:00 a.m., and we’re at a winery. I know while technically it may be 5:00 somewhere, this\nmay be a bit of a stretch.\nAnd I also thank you all for coming out this morning. It is always a pleasure to not only see so many\nfamiliar faces but also to get to know new ones.\nAnd no matter whether we are meeting today for the first time or just the latest of many, what excites\nme is that we’re all here for the same key reason. We care about Philadelphia. With its diversity of\npeoples and opportunities, Philadelphia remains an economic driver and leader.\nSo, I am happy to be here to give you my sense of where we are and where I see us heading, as well as\nto highlight a few things we have going on down Arch Street at the Philadelphia Fed, which you may find\nof interest.\nBefore I go any further, allow me to get a piece of business out of the way at the outset — and that’s the\nregular Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOr, in simple English, you can always say, “Pat said.” You just can’t say, “the Fed said.”\nNow, this year I sit as a voting member of the FOMC. At our meeting two weeks ago, I joined my\ncolleagues on the Committee in voting to raise the policy rate another 25 basis points, to a range of\n5¼ to 5½ percent — the 11th policy rate increase in the span of 12 meetings.\n1\n\n\fBut you knew that. I bet what you want to know is what we are going to do next. Unfortunately, I do not\nknow — it depends on what the data will tell us from now to our next meeting in September.\nWhat I can tell you is where we stand now given past actions, what I expect to see in the data going\nforward, and whether I believe that we need to do more, or not.\nTen days ago, the latest PCE inflation report showed continued disinflation year over year on the\nheadline measure and promise on the core measure. We are making progress against inflation. It has\nbeen slow progress, and I am watchful of any reemerging price pressures. We remain unwavering in our\ncommitment to bring inflation back to target.\nAnd this is indeed what I expect will happen. I expect core PCE inflation to decline to a rate perhaps just\nbelow 4 percent year over year by the end of 2023, before falling below 3 percent next year and leveling\nout at our 2 percent target in 2025.\nWhile this economy may not be hewing to traditional modeling and seems to bend some rules in one\nplace and make up its own in another, it continues to move along. I forecast unemployment to tick up\nslightly and better align with the natural unemployment rate as labor tightness continues to ease. And\nwhen it comes to GDP, I expect the rate of growth to be slightly lower than what we have seen so far\nthis year.\nIn sum, I expect only a modest slowdown in economic activity to go along with a slow but sure\ndisinflation. In other words, I do see us on the flight path to the soft landing we all hope for and that has\nproved quite elusive in the past.\nNow that you know what I expect, I can tell you what I believe: Absent any alarming new data between\nnow and mid-September, I believe we may be at the point where we can be patient and hold rates\nsteady and let the monetary policy actions we have taken do their work.\nI take my role seriously in achieving the Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and maximum\nemployment. And I remain focused on seeing us achieve these goals to support our long-term economic\nsuccess.\nAllow me to be clear about one thing, however. Should we be at that point where we can hold steady,\nwe will need to be there for a while. The pandemic taught us to never say never, but I do not foresee\nany likely circumstance for an immediate easing of the policy rate.\nBefore the Committee meets again, we will have a slew of new economic data to consider, with another\nPCE report, one more employment report, and two CPI reports among them. And I will continue to talk\nand listen to people from throughout the Third District. Together, these will provide the guidance I will\nneed in considering my ultimate stance heading into September’s Committee meeting.\n2\n\n\fThis slew of data is not just national in scope. I also closely consider what I see going on right here in the\nPhiladelphia region. So, allow me to take a couple of minutes to share with you my more localized view.\nOverall, the area’s economy reflects weakened conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas\nsuch as housing, but maintains strengths, particularly in the labor market. While survey responses from\nboth manufacturing and nonmanufacturing businesses reflect currently weakened business activity\nacross the region, responses have moved positive for future expectations. Inflationary pressures in the\nregion have also waned somewhat though — as it is across the nation — inflation generally remains\nabove target and wage pressures remain elevated.\nThat’s the snapshot. But let’s look a little deeper.\nPennsylvania’s Coincident Index, the Philadelphia Fed’s summary metric of economic activity, increased\n1.4 percent in the second quarter and 0.6 percent from May to June, reflecting positive conditions.\nThere was a rise in payroll employment, the unemployment rate fell during the three-month period, and\nthere was an increase in average hours worked in manufacturing. Overall, year to year, the index has\nrisen 3.6 percent.\nAnother positive indicator is business formation, which in Pennsylvania continues well above\nprepandemic levels, with more than 12,500 business applications as of June 2023, compared with\nroughly 8,600 in February 2020, seasonally adjusted.\nOn the jobs front, the Philadelphia MSA has not only fully recovered its pandemic-era losses but is\ncurrently running 96,000 jobs above February 2020. Notably, this includes the hospitality sector, which\nis at full recovery.\nAnd, speaking of hospitality, we know that restaurants and hotels are good indicators of consumer\nspending and local economic health. One of the data sets we look at in the Philadelphia Fed is the trend\ndata for seated diners, which currently shows restaurant activity more than 4.5 percent above this time\nlast year.\nThe hotel sector, however, remains slightly below where it was prepandemic, despite Taylor Swift’s best\nefforts.\nWhen it comes to housing, Philadelphia Fed researchers also recently looked at current, real-time asking\nrents region-wide. Like many areas of the country over the past three years, Philadelphia experienced\nsignificant rent inflation, but the data now show that tapering off, as asking rents on average slightly\ndecreased 0.14 percent from April to May and basically have not changed across a three-month span.\nLooking at residential sales, current market tightness continues. As mortgage rates have risen, it is\nunderstandable that current homeowners don’t want to put their houses on the market and step away\nfrom their current low-rate mortgages, diminishing inventory. And, certainly, a lack of inventory keeps\n3\n\n\fprices elevated, which further impacts the depth of the potential buyer pool. Both are understandable\noutcomes.\nI am also very sensitive to the state of the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, especially here in Center\nCity. And I am glad that part of the discussion that will follow me will be specifically dedicated to CRE.\nFirst, I recognize the potential impact on financial institutions heavily invested in CRE, should they get\npressed into ownership in the event of a loan default. But on a more street level, I have concerns about\nthe health of the businesses traditionally supported by now-remote workers or those only in their\noffices intermittently, especially in the restaurant and services industries.\nAs the Philadelphia Business Journal itself reported just a few weeks ago, it will take many months,\nperhaps a couple of years, for the commercial real estate market to shake itself out and rightsize, given\nthe shifts in working environments. We will be watching this carefully, I assure you.\nLooking ahead, I am also focused, as many are, on the potential impact of the October 1 resumption of\nfederal student loan payments. Even with new income-based payment plans set to reduce payments for\nmany borrowers, our contacts have expressed concern about their capacity to reintegrate these\nborrowers into the repayment system.\nSo, how this system is implemented, and how prepared borrowers are and where their repayment funds\nwill come from — whether from paychecks or savings — will be something we will be keeping a close\neye on.\nAs we’ve been tracking, credit card balances and loan delinquency rates have both been increasing in\nrecent months. Coinciding with this has been a decrease in bank balances, as consumers have drawn\nmore from their savings to pay their bills, even if this drawdown is of pandemic-era supports they’ve\nheld on to. This is not the ideal consumer finance backdrop in which one would necessarily want to add\npotentially hundreds of dollars in new monthly student loan payments.\nBut, overall, I believe that the resilience we’ve seen in our economy will continue, and I do believe we\nare poised to come out from under the pressure of inflation in good condition, both nationally and right\nhere in Philadelphia and the region.\nBut what the economy on the other side will look like is not set in stone and is something that we at the\nPhiladelphia Fed are working hard to help decipher. So, please allow me a couple of minutes to highlight\ntwo ongoing initiatives: the Anchor Economy Initiative and the Worker Voices Project.\nThe Philadelphia Fed established the Anchor Economy Initiative to dive deep into the economic impacts\nthat hospitals and institutions of higher education have on their home regions. While it’s long been\nassumed that there’s been a positive benefit, we lacked the data to capture the economic impacts of\n“eds and meds.”\n4\n\n\fOver the course of a year, the team at the Philadelphia Fed pulled together data from all 524 regions of\nthe United States to create the Anchor Economy Dashboard, which measures the direct, indirect, and\ninduced economic impacts these institutions have on their communities.\nThe dashboard also includes a reliance index to indicate how dependent a region is on higher eds and\nhospitals for economic activity. With 1 as a baseline average, Philadelphia came in at an index of 1.4.\nWhile an increased reliance on eds and meds can be a concern in places where institutions are\nvulnerable from challenges in health care and declining college enrollments, in Philadelphia, our eds and\nmeds are more likely a strength. In fact, if you break down the data, these anchor institutions support\nnearly 496,000 jobs and nearly $34 billion in employment income and benefits up and down the chain.\nFurther, they add more than $51 billion to our regional GDP — roughly 11.4 percent of the region’s\ntotal. Moreover, each job created in the anchor economy has a multiplier effect of creating roughly one\nother job elsewhere in our area.\nUltimately, the power of having data is the power to make positive change in communities. The\ndashboard is a tool for communities to use in their economic development planning. For instance, St.\nLouis and Chicago are both using the regional data as context for some deeper dives they’re doing on\nimpacts at the neighborhood level. And, here in Philadelphia, I recently sat down with institutional\nleaders to begin discussions of how we may all be able to augment each other’s efforts.\nThe basic recognition is that each institution comes with its own sets of priorities, opportunities, and\nchallenges. But if we pull back the layers, we’ll find the points from which collective strengths can be\nleveraged and strong partnerships can emerge for an even larger impact.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative is just getting started, so there will be much more to report as time goes\non.\nThe Worker Voices Project is a more than year-long partnership between our colleagues at the Atlanta\nFed — and other Fed Banks — focused on meeting with and listening to workers in low-wage jobs and\nthose with a college degree to understand more fully what truly matters to them when deciding where,\nwhen, and whether to work, especially in this post-pandemic job market.\nI know we’ve all heard — and some have maybe even said — the phrase, “No one wants to work\nanymore.” But that’s an overly simplistic view. What we’ve learned is that there are a multitude of\nreasons why a worker may have exited the labor market at the onset of the pandemic only to reenter\nfrom an entirely different door on the other side of it or quit jobs at such a high rate.\nYes, workers want to be paid what they believe they are worth and bring to the table, but it’s not only\nabout wages. And, yes, they want to be somewhere they can be productive and contributing employees,\nbut not if they don’t believe their contributions are appreciated, let alone rewarded.\n5\n\n\fWhat we increasingly heard is that workers want something for which economists don’t yet have a\nmetric: to be treated with dignity.\nThe factors going into the decisions of where to work, or whether to go in an entirely different direction,\nare increasingly complex. And these complexities may make us rethink what we thought we knew about\nlabor markets.\nAllow me to provide two examples from earlier this summer, when I had the opportunity at the\nPhiladelphia Fed to engage with workers as part of the Worker Voices Project. One young woman, a\nsingle working mother, told me that she changed jobs because she needed a manager who understood\nhow last-minute schedule changes impacted her ability to find childcare. And we heard from a young\nman who left a job that required him to be on the road; yet, when diagnosed with a condition that left\nhim prone to severe seizures, his manager still wanted him spending his days driving, as opposed to\nsimilar work that could be done from a stationary location.\nAs one participant summed it up, “We’re looking for a place where we belong.”\nFor us as policymakers and employers, those words can point us in the direction for creating a strong,\ngrowing, and more inclusive economy.\nWhich, after all, is what we all want and is the reason why we’re all here today. We at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia are just as committed to the economic health of our region and our\nresidents as you are. And we remain at the ready with the data and insights necessary to help you make\nthe decisions that will lead to your success.\nWith all that said — and I know it’s a lot — I’d be happy to step back and take some questions.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fHighlighting the Labor Market’s New Complexities; Listening to Worker Voices\nNational Association for Business Economics (NABE)\nMonetary Policy and Outlook Webinar\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJune 1, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you in this series on monetary policy and our\neconomic outlook.\nAnd I thank NABE for the invite and Dr. Elaine Buckberg for moderating.\nYou heard from my colleague, Richmond Fed President and CEO Tom Barkin, on Tuesday, so I am\nhonored to provide a Fed bookend to this webinar.\nI look forward to having a useful and engaging dialogue. But please allow me to open with my thoughts\non the direction in which we are heading.\nAnd I must lead with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nWhile headline PCE inflation has come down from its peak of 7 percent last year, it is still running at over\n4 percent year over year — way above the Fed’s long-run target of 2 percent annually. Disinflation is\nunder way, but it is doing so at a disappointingly slow pace.\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for American families — cutting into purchasing\npower and household wealth. And the pain isn’t being felt equally.\n\n1\n\n\fThe toll is falling most heavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the elevated\ncosts of housing, food, and health care — life’s true necessities.\nTo combat this inflation, the Fed has been working to slow the economy modestly and bring demand\nmore in line with supply. We have increased the target range for the federal funds rate — our primary\nmonetary policy tool — by 500 basis points since March 2022. Ongoing balance sheet reduction is also\ntightening financial conditions.\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working; for example, house price indexes\nare cooling.\nAnd it is encouraging that even as we have raised rates, the national economy remains relatively healthy\noverall. Since January, we’ve experienced modest growth in economic activity.\nThere are also still a record number of Americans employed, with more than 1 million jobs created, on\nnet, so far this year. While there are some signs that labor market tightness is beginning to ease a bit,\nthe unemployment rate remains near record lows — 3.4 percent in April.\nWe’re also paying close attention to the banking system. The recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank,\nSignature Bank, and First Republic ignited an understandable wave of anxiety among banks, depositors,\nand investors. But I can assure you that the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient.\nWe know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can undermine confidence in healthy banks.\nThat’s why the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed acted quickly to protect the U.S. economy and its\nbanking interests. The Federal Reserve also led a thorough, transparent, and swift review of the events\nsurrounding Silicon Valley Bank so we could learn what went wrong.\nSo, of course, I know the question on everyone’s mind: OK, Pat, where do we go from here?\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate: to promote full employment and\nprice stability. On the jobs front, things look quite good; we are, effectively, at full employment. But\nwhen it comes to inflation, there is still significant room for improvement.\n2\n\n\fIt will take some time to evaluate how recent events may impact overall economic activity and inflation.\nI expect to see tighter credit conditions for households and businesses that may slow economic activity\nand hiring, but the full extent is still unclear.\nWhat is clear is that the Fed remains fully committed to return inflation to its 2 percent target. To do\nthis, the policy stance needs to be restrictive enough — but what is “enough” is not written in stone\nsomewhere.\nInstead, I am closely monitoring incoming data, listening to our contacts and audiences, and evaluating\neconomic conditions to assess whether additional tightening will be needed.\nI do believe that we are close to the point where we can hold rates in place and let monetary policy do\nits work to bring inflation back to the target in a timely manner.\nAlong this path, I project that we will see modest growth this year, with real GDP coming in a bit below 1\npercent.\nI expect inflation to decline to somewhere around 3.5 percent this year, before falling to 2.5 percent in\n2024, and leveling out at our 2 percent target in 2025. Unemployment is also likely to tick up slightly,\nhitting around 4.4 percent this year.\nBut this is just a snapshot of what conditions look like today. We’re operating in a very uncertain\nenvironment, and I will be closely monitoring our dashboards of economic indicators and assessing their\nimplications.\nNow, as I’ve said before, survey data are an important tool in the economic business. At the Fed, we\nlook at everything from big broad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures\nlike restaurant reservations and mobility data.\nThese data — hard data — tell us a lot. But even hard data have their limits. The numbers can point in a\ncertain direction, yet there may be a lot going on underneath those numbers, which is not as easily\nvisible but is just as vital to drawing a complete picture.\n3\n\n\fTake, for example, the employment picture.\nThroughout the past year, each interest rate hike was predictably followed by voices warning that we\nwere about to tank the labor market and spike unemployment. That hasn’t happened, but we monitor\nthese trends to see how workers will be impacted if it does.\nGiven the tight labor market, there’s obviously something deeper happening. We continually hear from\nsome employers that certain tools aren’t working as they once did. Simply offering higher wages still\nisn’t attracting the workers some need, and some efforts to increase the productivity of current workers\nis instead leading to increased turnover.\nThese cases are especially true at the lower end of the wage scale, and this may be why some have\ngroused that, “No one wants to work anymore.” But I think we all would agree there’s more going on\nunder the surface.\nNow, I’m not strictly an economist. I’m a civil engineer. And that background is what is forcing me to\nlook at this issue in a different way.\nAnd this is what we at the Philadelphia Fed are doing. And I’d like to spend a few moments on this\nbefore we get to our Q&A.\nOver the past year, our Community Development and Regional Outreach team, along with colleagues at\nthe Atlanta Fed and elsewhere, engaged with low-wage and non-degree-holding workers nationwide in\na series of focus group conversations.\nWe’ve been listening to them and to their reasons why they may have exited the labor market at the\nonset of the pandemic to reenter from an entirely different door on the other side of it or are quitting\njobs at such a high rate.\nWe’re calling this effort the Worker Voices Project. And we released our first report — “Shifting\nPerspectives and Expectations on Employment” — one week ago.\n4\n\n\fYes, workers want to be paid what they believe they are worth and bring to the table, but it’s not only\nabout wages. And, yes, they want to be somewhere they can be productive and contributing employees,\nbut not if they don’t believe their contributions are appreciated, let alone rewarded.\nWhat we increasingly heard is that workers want something that we, as economists and civil engineers,\ndon’t yet have a metric for: being treated with dignity.\nAs one participant told me recently, “Work is not the end-all, be-all.” Or, in the words of another,\n“We’re looking for a place where we belong.”\nThe factors going into the decisions of where to work, or whether to go in an entirely different direction,\nare increasingly complex. And these complexities may make us rethink what we thought we knew about\nlabor markets.\nI encourage everyone to take a look at our initial Worker Voices Project report.\nFor us as policymakers, soft data are perhaps equally important to get a full understanding of our\neconomic situation. And the soft data we’re getting through Worker Voices are what will help us chart a\ncourse for a strong and growing — but also a more inclusive — American economy.\nI know that’s a lot to start with, but I also know it’s what is going to lead us to a great conversation.\nAnd, Elaine, to that end, let’s get right to it.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fUnderstanding Monetary Policy Through the Housing Channel\nSamuel Zell and Robert Lurie Real Estate Center Members’ Meeting\nThe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\nPhiladelphia, PA\nApril 20, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood evening, everyone! Any time I get to spend with the Wharton family is time well spent,\nand this is certainly no exception. Thank you for the invitation to join you tonight.\nWith the economy and the Federal Reserve in the news a lot lately, I thought we should spend\nour time together covering a few topics of interest. First, I’ll talk about current economic\nconditions and how they are affecting the Fed’s monetary policy actions. Then, I’ll take a deep\ndive into the effects that monetary policy can have on the housing market and how these\nimpacts transmit through the economy. After that, I plan to leave plenty of time at the end for\nyour questions and comments.\nBut before I do any of that, I have to issue the standard disclaimer: The views I express tonight\nare my own and don’t necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe State of the Economy\nWith that out of the way … let’s talk about the state of the economy. In the wake of the\npandemic, one word has remained top of mind for the Federal Reserve: inflation.\n1\n\n\fWhile headline PCE inflation has come down from its peak of 7 percent last year, it is still\nrunning at 5 percent year over year — way above the Fed’s long-run target of 2 percent\nannually. Recent readings show that inflation is continuing to recede, but it’s doing so slowly.\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for Americans — cutting into purchasing\npower and household wealth. And the pain isn’t being felt equally. The toll is falling most\nheavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the elevated costs of\nshelter, food, and health care — life’s true necessities.\nTo combat this inflation, the Fed has been working to slow the economy modestly and bring it\nmore in line with supply. We have increased the target range for the federal funds rate — our\nprimary monetary policy tool — by 475 basis points since March 2022. Balance sheet reduction\nis another way to tighten conditions.\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working — for example, house\nprice indexes are cooling.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we have raised rates, the national economy remains\nrelatively healthy overall. Since January, we’ve experienced strong growth in economic activity.\nThere are also still a record number of Americans employed, with more than 1 million jobs\ncreated, on net, so far this year. While there are some signs that labor market tightness is\nbeginning to ease a bit, the unemployment rate remains near record lows — 3.5 percent in\nMarch.\nWe’re also paying close attention to the banking system. The recent failures of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank ignited an understandable wave of anxiety among banks, depositors,\nand investors. But I can assure you that the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient.\n\n2\n\n\fWe know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can undermine confidence in healthy\nbanks. That’s why the Treasury, FDIC, and the Fed acted quickly to protect the U.S. economy\nand its banking interests. The Federal Reserve is also leading a thorough, transparent, and swift\nreview of the events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank so that we can learn what went wrong.\nTaking all of this into account, here’s my outlook for what you should expect from the Federal\nReserve and the economy in the near term.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate: to promote full\nemployment and price stability. On the jobs front, things look quite good; we are, effectively, at\nfull employment. But when it comes to inflation, there is still significant room for improvement.\nIt will take some time to evaluate how recent events may impact overall economic activity and\ninflation. I expect to see tighter credit conditions for households and businesses that may slow\neconomic activity and hiring, but the full extent is still unclear.\nWhat is clear is that the Fed remains fully committed to its 2 percent inflation target. To achieve\nthat, I anticipate that some additional tightening may be needed to ensure policy is restrictive\nenough to support both pillars of our dual mandate. Once we reach that point, which should\nhappen this year, I expect that we will hold rates in place and let monetary policy do its work.\nAlong this path, I project that we will see modest growth this year, with real GDP coming in a bit\nbelow 1 percent. I expect inflation to continue declining, landing somewhere between 3\npercent and 3.5 percent this year, before falling to 2.5 percent in 2024, and leveling out at our 2\npercent target in 2025. Unemployment is also likely to tick up slightly, hitting around 4.4\npercent this year.\n\n3\n\n\fBut this is just a snapshot of what conditions look like today. We’re operating in a very\nuncertain environment, and I will be closely monitoring our dashboards of economic indicators\nand assessing their implications.\nThe Housing Channel\nI often get asked how the Fed measures the impact of its monetary policy decisions.\nUnfortunately, there’s no simple answer.\nMonetary policy has both immediate and lagging impacts, which affect sectors of the economy\nin different — and often interconnected — ways. To make better sense of it, economists sort\nthese impacts into “channels.”\nBut even within a channel, it can be difficult to get a clear picture of how monetary policy is\ntransmitting — something we can see by taking a closer look at one of our most studied and\nwell-known channels.\nAfter just about every FOMC meeting, you’ll see some version of the same headline pop up:\n“What does the Fed’s decision mean for home buyers?”\nSo, let’s focus our conversation there: on the housing channel. How do the Fed’s actions impact\nhome buyers?\nMortgage Rates\nAs you all know, the Fed doesn’t actually set mortgage rates. Our primary tool for conducting\nmonetary policy, as I mentioned, is the target range for the federal funds rate. But there is a\nclose relationship between this rate and the mortgage rates that are offered to consumers.\nFederal funds transactions are unsecured overnight loans, typically used by depository\ninstitutions to lend or borrow reserves. Of course, this isn’t how people finance home\n4\n\n\fpurchases. They take out mortgages that are collateralized and spread out over multiple years,\nif not decades.\nMortgage lenders take this into account when setting interest rates. They’re not only looking at\nwhat the federal funds rate is today, but what they expect it to be 10 or more years down the\nline. They’re also considering a whole host of broader macroeconomic factors.\nYet there is a clear and fast pass-through from the federal funds rate to mortgage rates. For\nexample, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage could be found for as low as 2.7 percent at the end of\n2020, when our policy rate was effectively at zero. In the last 12 months, that same 30-year\nfixed rate mortgage has climbed to nearly 7 percent, with policy rates now close to 5 percent.\nNow, you might think this means that home buyers are the first stakeholders within the\nhousing channel to be impacted by the Fed’s monetary policy actions. But when rates are\nfalling, there’s another group that can feel it even sooner — and there isn’t even a real estate\ntransaction involved.\nRefinancers\nMortgage refinancing is a big business — if interest rates are going down. In fact, when the\nFOMC cut the federal funds rate to zero in response to the pandemic, refinancing rose to a\nstaggering $2.6 trillion in 2020 and 2021 — more than double the prepandemic value.\nAs homeowners refinanced their mortgages into lower-interest loans, it freed up monthly\nincome, boosting household consumption and savings. This, in turn, helped the economy better\nweather the uncertainty caused by the pandemic — one of the FOMC’s objectives for cutting\nrates at the time.\nThe situation looks quite different today. When mortgage rates increase, there’s little incentive\nto refinance — and we see this show up in recent data. Refinancing fell to $66 billion in the last\n5\n\n\fquarter of 2022. Other instruments that let owners tap into their home equity, like home equity\nlines of credit, have become more expensive as well.\nIt’s also worth noting that refinancing is history dependent when it comes to the potential\nimpact of monetary policy. 1 What rates have been, and for how long, directly affect how much\nrefinancing will be triggered by accommodative monetary policy. With most mortgages today\nlocked in at very low rates, even bringing the federal funds rate all the way back to zero would\nbe unlikely to trigger much meaningful refinancing.\nHome Buyers and Sellers\nNow, let’s turn to our next group of stakeholders impacted by the Fed’s monetary policy\ndecisions: home buyers and sellers.\nHere, it’s time to state the obvious. A higher federal funds rate almost always leads to higher\nmortgage rates, which makes buying a house more expensive for prospective homeowners.\nHigher costs typically dampen demand on both sides of a potential transaction. Home buyers\nmay choose to wait for lower prices or lower rates to make a purchase. Homeowners,\nmeanwhile, may postpone selling to preserve a locked low-interest rate or wait for a higher\nprice. As home sales slow, house prices should eventually decrease, though this usually\nhappens with a lag.\nAfter a year of interest rate increases, we have started to see this process play out in the\ncurrent housing market. After sales of existing homes exceeded 6 million in 2021, we saw sales\nduring the last quarter of 2022 average 4 million at an annual rate. Sales of new homes were\nalso halved from their peak. Meanwhile, house prices have fallen each month since their peak\nin June, though they remain at similar levels to what we saw a year ago.\n\n6\n\n\fA drop in house prices can have notable effects within the broader economy. During the Great\nRecession, we saw a pronounced decrease in household consumption tied to declining home\nprices. More recent research has emphasized liquidity effects, which can play an important role\nin determining the strength and timing of monetary policy transmission in the housing channel.\nRonel Elul, from the Philadelphia Fed, and coauthors argue that once all credit constraints that\nhouseholds face are accounted for, there are negligible wealth effects.\nAs we look at the current situation, U.S. households have entered the tightening cycle with\nvery healthy balance sheets. Existing homeowners are also benefiting from low mortgage rates\nand elevated home equity. This gives a “cushion” for homeowners, making it unlikely that a\ncorrection in house prices would trigger widespread liquidity constraints and consumer\nspending reductions.\nIt’s also important to point out that there will never be a perfect relationship between interest\nrates and home-buying trends. The purchase of a home is often associated with other major life\nevents, like getting married. This means that a certain level of housing demand will always be\npresent, regardless of mortgage rates or house prices.\nRenters and Landlords\nThat brings us to our next group of stakeholders who will be most impacted by changes to\nmonetary policy: renters and landlords.\nThe rental market is where we start to see lags pile up as conflicting dynamics play out. As\npotential home buyers delay purchases because of higher rates, rental demand can increase,\nincentivizing landlords to raise rents. 2 But their ability to do so immediately can be limited by\nleasing terms that range anywhere from six to 24 months. Landlords may also hesitate to raise\nrents on existing tenants in good standing, who may balk at significant increases and leave units\nempty for months. Striking the right balance is a juggling act.\n\n7\n\n\fWhat’s the end result from a monetary policy perspective? A very protracted and muted effect\non renters — who, we can’t forget, make up about a third of total U.S. households.\nBuilders and Investors\nThe impacts only get fainter as we branch out beyond the rental market and into a world many\nof you know well: the supply side. Both builders and investors in the housing channel also\nrespond to monetary policy actions, but long project lead times mean the lags here are\nsubstantial. They’re also more likely to be closely interrelated with other channels, like the cost\nof goods.\nWhere are we today? Housing starts have been slowing down compared with a year ago, but\nthey remain well above their average levels since the Great Recession and prior to the\npandemic. Starts for multiunit structures, which have even longer building lags, have yet to\nabate.\nBack to the Dual Mandate\nUp to this point, we have explored how monetary policy impacts the housing market. But the\nFed’s dual mandate is maximum employment and price stability overall. So, the next question\nbecomes: How much does housing matter for total employment and aggregate inflation?\nFor employment, the answer is: not too much. Employment in construction represents just\nabout 5 percent of total nonfarm payrolls, and only a fraction works with residential buildings.\nLags here confound the picture quite a bit. While employment in construction is still growing\nslightly year over year, declining residential investment has subtracted more than 1 percentage\npoint of GDP growth in the second half of last year.\nBut when it comes to inflation, housing matters. Home prices and rents are also major drivers\nof inflation. Housing makes up about a third of the basket of goods used by the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics to calculate the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Yet, even as home prices have fallen,\n8\n\n\fshelter inflation has steadily increased. In fact, more than 60 percent of the increase in the\nmost recent core CPI can be attributed to rising shelter costs.\nStructural Factors\nNow, I have mainly talked about housing through the narrow lens of monetary policy. But I’d be\nremiss if I also didn’t touch on the structural factors impacting housing — most notably, the\nlack of affordable housing.\nSince the Great Recession, the U.S. hasn’t built enough housing to keep price growth in check.\nBy most estimates, we are now several million homes short of where we need to be. This is a\nprimary driver of shelter inflation, which, as we discussed, is one of the key reasons core\ninflation remains so high.\nGetting shelter inflation under control is an urgent priority. Monetary policy has a role to play\nhere in broadly fighting inflation, bringing down the costs of goods and services related to the\nhousing channel. But to fully address the scope and scale of this problem, we also need action\nfrom federal, state, and local governments.\nWhat could this look like? Some of the ideas I’ve seen mentioned include changing zoning laws,\nrevising tax codes, building workforce housing, and creating housing subsidies.\nAs a Fed president, I’m neutral on the merits of any specific policy; that’s for other policymakers\nto decide. But I’m not neutral on the need to do something.\nShelter inflation is a macroeconomic drag. Money spent on housing is money that’s not being\nspent on education, services, and durable goods.\nThere are also already signs that our most vibrant metro areas aren’t achieving their full\neconomic potential, because millions of would-be participants simply can’t afford to live there.\n9\n\n\fThis has major implications for our long-term economic growth, something we should all be\nconcerned about.\nThe Economy Is People\nAs you can see, the housing channel is incredibly complex and interconnected. And it’s only one\nof the many channels we look at to determine how monetary policy is transmitting through the\neconomy. It’s a reminder of why I have always approached this job with humility.\nThe economy isn’t the Federal Reserve, or interest rates, or numbers in a data report. The\neconomy is people — living and working and making the best decisions they can with the\ninformation they have.\nThe only way we can make sound monetary policy decisions is to carefully consider all these\ndifferent perspectives — not only in what the data tell us, but in what we hear from people\ndirectly. Because if we only looked at the economy from a 30,000-foot view, we’d miss a whole\nlot about what’s happening on the ground.\nIt’s also why I love coming to events like this one. While my remarks tonight were confined to\nmonetary policy and the residential home market, I’m eager to hear from all of you about what\nyou’re seeing in the commercial real estate space. You’re on the frontlines of the future of\nwork, the future of retail, and the future of our cities — the very factors that will drive the\nfuture of our economy. Any insights you’d like to share tonight would be well considered and\nmuch appreciated.\nWith that, let’s get to your questions and comments.\nEndnotes\nMartin Eichenbaum, Sergio Rebelo, and Arlene Wong, “State Dependent Effects of Monetary Policy: The\nRefinancing Channel,” American Economic Review 112(3) (March 2022), pp. 721–761.\n\n1\n\nDaniel Dias and João B.

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHello, everyone. Thanks so much for having me. It’s great to be here with all of you, and I’m eager to get to\nour conversation.\nBut with the Federal Reserve in the news a lot lately, I wanted to take a few minutes at the top to frame\nour discussion. What can I say, it’s the former professor in me.\nLet me start with the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are my own, and they don’t\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nFirst, let me address the topic you’ve probably heard about the most recently: the failures of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank. One of the Fed’s most important jobs is supervising and regulating banks. So let\nme put your minds at ease: The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient.\nBut we’re not taking anything for granted. We know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can\nundermine confidence in healthy banks. That’s why the Federal Reserve is leading a thorough, transparent,\nand swift review of the events involving SVB so that we can learn from this experience.\nWith that being said, let’s talk a little about the Fed and its other important job: monetary policy. As many\nof you know, the Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, based in Washington, D.C., and\n12 regional banks around the country.\nEach regional bank has its own president and board of directors — a group of business, banking, and\ncommunity leaders who give us insight into the sectors and issues that make each region tick.\nMy District — the Third District — covers eastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, and all of Delaware. It’s the\nsmallest District geographically, but I like to think we punch above our weight.\nThe decentralized nature of the Fed is, in my mind, our greatest strength.\nWe’re tasked with making national policy in service of our dual mandate — full employment and price\nstability. But we serve an enormous country made up of vastly different economic realities. If we looked at\ndata only from a 30,000-foot view, we’d miss a whole lot about what’s happening on the ground.\nSo, what have we been learning about the state of the economy from all of our inputs?\nOn the employment side of the dual mandate, we see that job gains are strong, and the unemployment\nrate remains low — 3.5 percent nationally last month. We are, effectively, at full employment.\n\n\fBut on the inflation side, we see a lot of room for improvement. Headline PCE inflation has come down\nfrom its peak of 7 percent last year (year over year, June 2022) but is still running, year over year, at 5\npercent — way above our 2 percent target. And recent readings show that disinflation is proceeding slowly\n— which is disappointing, to say the least.\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for Americans — cutting into purchasing power and\nhousehold wealth. And, as is so often the case, the pain isn’t distributed equally. The toll is falling most\nheavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the rising costs of shelter, food, and\nhealth care — life’s true necessities.\nTo combat inflation, the Fed is working to slow the economy modestly and bring it more in line with\nsupply. To accomplish this, we have increased the federal funds rate — our primary monetary policy tool\n— by 475 basis points since March 2022. Balance sheet reduction is another way to tighten conditions.\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working — for example, house price indexes\nare cooling.\nSince the full impact of monetary policy actions can take as much as 18 months to work its way through\nthe economy, we will continue to look closely at available data to determine what, if any, additional\nactions we may need to take. But make no mistake: We are fully committed to bringing inflation back\ndown to our 2 percent target.\nBefore we get to our Q&A, I’ll leave you with one final thought.\nWith all the attention our interest rate decisions get every six weeks, it might seem like the Fed is the\nprimary force driving what happens in the economy. But that’s just not the case.\nThe Fed implements monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate for an economy made up of countless\nworkers, businesses, investors, and institutions. An economy that you are, and will continue to be, an\nimportant part of — especially with your Wharton education backing you up.\nAs you think about the opportunities that await you beyond this place, one of the most powerful things\nyou can do is be intentional about how you want to contribute to the economy.\nWhether you head to Wall Street, become an entrepreneur, or pursue a career in public service, you have\na tremendous opportunity to help shape the world around you. I hope you take advantage of it.\nWith that, let’s get to your questions.\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon! It’s great to return to this event. It was 2017 when I last spoke at this annual economic\noutlook. My topic back then focused on challenges in the economy. Here we are in 2023 — and there\nare still economic challenges to address — albeit very different ones from six years ago.\nThere are a few areas we’ll explore today. First, because I can’t resist donning my old teaching cap, I’d\nlike to offer some background about what the Fed is and what it does. I’ll also talk about what the Fed\ndoesn’t do, because sometimes the Fed’s powers are overestimated. I’ll then pivot to the economic\noutlook for our country and our region, and touch on my approach to monetary policy. After that, we\ncan get to some questions, which is something I always enjoy and look forward to.\nBut before we do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s start with some Fed history.\nFederal Reserve History and Structure\nThe First Bank of the United States was the brainchild of the man who in recent years has become\neverybody’s favorite founding father: Alexander Hamilton. The bank was located right here in\nPhiladelphia when it was still the capital of the country. It was established in 1791 to deal with the debt\nfrom the Revolutionary War and to ensure the government’s financial stability. It looked a lot different\nthan the entity we are today, and it wasn’t without controversy.\n\n1\n\n\fAs Broadway has reminded us, Thomas Jefferson was among those who worried about power that was\ntoo strong and too centralized. He even once famously said he found banks to be more dangerous than\nstanding armies. When the bank’s charter was up for renewal after its initial 20 years, the Jeffersonian\nargument won out and the measure failed by a vote each in the House and the Senate. The bank was\ndissolved.\nFive years later, Congress agreed to a central banking function a second time, and we launched the\nimaginatively named Second Bank of the United States. And about 20 years after that, Congress decided\nnot to renew the charter, again owing to a strain of popular sentiment that didn’t trust powerful,\ncentralized institutions.\nBut not having a central bank didn’t really work because it tended to breed volatility.\nThe period leading up to the third iteration of American central banking — the Federal Reserve — was\nmarked by currency instability, bank runs, and cycles of boom and bust. At one point, J.P. Morgan\nactually had to step in personally to bail out the country. If you’ve ever been to the Morgan Library &\nMuseum in New York, you can stand in the room where the solution to that financial crisis was worked\nout.\nEven during the Revolutionary War era, central banking was standard in democracies, and it remains\nthat way today. There are no developed economies that don’t have it in some form. So, the eventual\nadoption of our current central bank — in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act — was to some extent\ninevitable. And the configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a decentralized\nstructure — is something of a testament to old-fashioned American compromise. It also reflects the\nunique demands of the United States and our economy.\nThe Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, and 12 regional\nBanks located around the country, including the one I oversee here in Philadelphia.\nThe Board seats seven governors, including the Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and\nboard of directors, which is made up of business, banking, and community leaders from the area.\nFundamentally, this provides the Fed with a perspective, within each District, of the sectors and issues\nthat make the region tick. We are here in the Third District, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania,\n\n2\n\n\fSouth Jersey, and the state of Delaware. We’re the smallest District, geographically, but I like to think we\npunch above our weight.\nThe Fed’s decentralized nature is, in my view, a unique strength. We’re making national policy, but\nwe’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data can obscure realities on the\nground. Conditions can look very different in Philadelphia, Dover, or Trenton than they do in Dallas, Salt\nLake City, or Honolulu. This system gives, in my view, a voice to a range of localities and sectors. It also\nallows us to focus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because we’re such\na big country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China and India have larger\npopulations, and no other country has a bigger economy, at least for now. And that economy is vast,\nspreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that most other nations don’t.\nSo, it makes sense that we have a system that feeds back information from around the country.\nThe other difference from most central banks is that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a single\ngoal; that is, we’re charged with both maximum employment and price stability. Most just focus on one.\nMaximum employment encompasses a wide range of metrics, although most attention is paid to the\nunemployment rate. That number, of course, will never be zero. Instead, we try to ensure that labor\nmarkets are functioning dynamically and efficiently. Price stability, on the other hand, is low and stable\ninflation, which we judge to be around 2 percent a year. More on both topics in a bit.\nThe decisions we make within the Fed — the way we look at the economy and respond to data — are\nbuilt entirely on the foundation of our dual mandate. It is our North Star.\nNow that we’ve established that, I turn to the question so many people secretly want to ask: What,\nexactly, does the Fed do? I’m delighted to talk about it, but just as important, I’ll also mention what we\ndon’t do.\nWe have lending power. What that means is we do not have spending power. We have no authority\nover fiscal policy, which deals with debts, deficits, and taxes. Or investments to encourage growth. Or\n\n3\n\n\fgrants to worthy organizations. Or programs to spur job creation. Those all depend on elected officials,\nbe they on the local, state, or national level.\nSo, what do we do?\nWe set monetary policy. We also regulate banks, along with an alphabet soup of government agencies.\nWe are the lender of last resort during bona fide emergencies.\nAnd the lede that always gets buried — and I wish it weren’t so overshadowed by discussions of interest\nrates — is that we work within our Districts to help strengthen local communities’ economies. We have\na truly exceptional team in Philadelphia in our Community Development and Regional Outreach\nDepartment, and they work with partners all over the Third District. They’re doing truly vital work on\nemployment, transportation, housing, and other issues.\nBut first, let me talk a bit about monetary policy. Monetary policy is a fairly limited field with a fairly\nconscripted set of tools.\nOur job is to create the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. More than anything, we’re\ntilling the land.\nMonetary policy is about meeting our dual mandate mostly by moving interest rates. There are other\ntools we use, but in normal times, it’s mostly about moving what is technically called the federal funds\nrate. In the media, that’s usually just called the interest rate.\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate on loans that banks make to each other overnight. That rate\ntends to influence interest rates more broadly, so the effect ripples through the economy. When we\nmove the federal funds rate, it affects the interest rate people pay on their mortgages and car loans and\nthat businesses pay to borrow to meet or expand their payrolls or buy inventory. In fact, sometimes just\nannouncing we are planning to raise the federal funds rate in the future affects these lending rates.\nWe set rates when the FOMC meets in Washington, which we do eight times a year.\nRegional Bank presidents don’t always get to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting position every three\nyears, but the governors always do, as does the president of the New York Fed. New York, which\nconducts the Fed’s market operations, enjoys something of a “first among equals” status within the\n4\n\n\fSystem. I’m voting this year. I’ve noticed people care a lot more about what I have to say recently, which\nI’m sure is just a coincidence. Regardless of whether we are voting or not, we do always represent our\nDistricts and play a part in the discussion.\nThe FOMC discussion is never political. Because we’re appointed policymakers, we don’t respond to\nswings in public opinion or election cycles. Unlike elected officials, who suffer the slings and arrows of\nthe 24-hour news machine, we operate in a rare, apolitical bubble. I truly believe that the independence\nof the Fed is crucial to making the best decisions possible for the American economy, free from the\npressures of politics.\nAlthough we’re independent, that doesn’t mean we’re unchecked. The Fed is what’s considered\n“independent within the government.” We’re overseen by Congress, but neither Congress nor the\npresidential administration has a say in the decisions we make.\nThat’s not to suggest the Fed doesn’t come under intense political scrutiny at times, particularly when\neconomic conditions are troubled.\nThe State of the Economy\nI just stepped back in time a few hundred years to consider the Fed’s origins. In keeping with that time\ntravel, I think it’s worth taking a step back and considering, briefly, how much has transpired over the\npast several years. You really can’t understand where our economy is, or where it’s going, without\nconsidering where we’ve come from.\nFirst and foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has\nendured because of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 6.5 million people globally\nhave perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and nearly 50,000\nPennsylvanians. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our\nlifetimes.\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of\nthe pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus\nspread and state and local governments closed businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of\nmillions of Americans lost their jobs in one of the sharpest recessions in American history.\n5\n\n\fThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened\nrestrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed\nand deployed.\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had\nopted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before\nCOVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill,\nand by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial and\ndisparate items like computer chips and cream cheese in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal\nspending from the federal government and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve\nstoked demand. This led to a phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few\ngoods” and the highest inflation in four decades.\nWhere We Are Nationally\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means\ndisproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and\nshelter have skyrocketed in price.\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Since March last year, we raised the target range\nfor the federal funds rate from zero to between 4.5 percent and 4.75 percent. That is a significant move,\nand a very fast one, with the FOMC raising rates 75 basis points at several meetings. But rates are now\nat a level that allow us to slow down and proceed cautiously and, to my mind, the days of us raising 75\nbasis points at a time have surely passed. Just at the last meeting, I voted for a hike of 25 basis points —\nwhat some would call slow but actually is closer to cruising speed when it comes to tightening. In my\nview, we are not done yet … but we are likely close.\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in\nplace and let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a\nsignificant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\n\n6\n\n\fOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal\nReserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, though it does seem like these problems\nare finally easing a bit. Or an endemic shortage of workers, that unfortunately has yet to ease. But we\ncan affect demand by making it more expensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening:\nWe’re seeing unmistakable signs of a slowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy,\nlike housing.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling,\nthe national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly\neven as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans\nare still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered the most during the pandemic, like\nleisure and hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing are\ncooling. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and hybrid\nwork is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban office\nparks.\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created\n4.8 million jobs, and while we are seeing some layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little\nevidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, in the latest data release, a staggering half a\nmillion new jobs were created in January. There is now a record number of Americans employed. And\nindeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.4 percent.\nWhere We Are Locally\nIn the Philadelphia area, conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, this region’s\neconomy reflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing,\nbut maintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug\nalong, and the unemployment rate has fallen and remains low. In fact, in the Philadelphia metropolitan\nstatistical area, the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent — effectively, full employment. As of the\nfourth quarter of 2022, the index for wages and salaries was up above 4 percent year over year in the\nPhiladelphia–Reading–Camden region.\n\n7\n\n\fOf course, even in a hot job market, some positions remain more in demand than others. According to\nan analysis of job listings for the Philadelphia area, some of the most frequent job ads are for registered\nnurses, retail salespeople, software developers, and customer service representatives, reflecting\ncontinued hot demand in health care, tech, and retail.\nNow, our region’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is\nmanufacturing. Responses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook\nSurvey, which covers the area, suggested overall declines in the sector in January. The survey’s\nindicators for current general activity and new orders remained negative, and the survey’s future\nindicators suggest tempered expectations for growth over the next six months.\nHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Single-family price\ngrowth in Philadelphia County is trending downward and was only around 3.6 percent year over year in\nNovember 2022, well down from the 6 percent to 8 percent price growth we experienced during the\npandemic. According to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut has increased over the past year and\nwas 22.7 percent in the Philadelphia metro area as of December. Also in December, the median days on\nthe market for a house for sale in Philadelphia was 41 days, matching the typical pre-pandemic figure,\nand showcasing a softening in conditions. The days of houses selling before they are even listed are in\nour rearview mirror.\nWhere We Are Going\nIn happier news, we are finally starting to see steady progress bringing inflation down across an array of\ngoods. With monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I\nforecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but\nsuggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and\nthen back down to 2 percent in 2025.\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to\nindicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year\nbefore climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\n\n8\n\n\fLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out modestly above\n4 percent this year. It’s an underrated advantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a\nposition of such labor market strength.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions\nfor a healthy labor market. I hope that the first part of my talk was interesting background and that the\nsecond part helped to illuminate today’s economic environment.\nAnd one last historical mention — consider a visit to the First and Second Banks of the U.S. — they’re\nright here in our backyard at Independence National Historical Park.\nSo again, thanks so much for having me. Now let’s get to your questions.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello! It’s great to be here in La Jolla. I didn’t realize when I received an invitation from GIC that this\nevent would have a connection to the Super Bowl. As we flew over Arizona, I saw that my connection\nwould be ever so slight — and that the closest I’d get to game tickets would be passing over the stadium\nat 30,000 feet. Go, Eagles!\nThis really is a terrific program, and we’ve already had some informative sessions. So, thank you to GIC\nfor having me and to all of you for joining us today.\nI would like to talk a bit today about the rapidly evolving payments landscape and, in particular, how the\nCOVID-19 pandemic brought unique challenges to American families and accelerated changes that were\nalready in motion. After I deliver my prepared remarks, we can have an open discussion, which I’m very\nmuch looking forward to.\nI will be measuring the economic and financial implications of the pandemic the way economists do,\nwith dollars and percentages and trends. But I do not forget that the pandemic has been — first and\nforemost — a humanitarian tragedy of global scale. More than 6.5 million people perished from the\nvirus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans. And those numbers would have been much\nworse if not for the many public health workers, and others in essential businesses, who stepped up so\nthat others could stay safe.\n\n1\n\n\fConsumer finance is an important area of study at the Philadelphia Fed, where our CFI — Consumer\nFinance Institute — continues to pursue path-breaking research. Simply put, the way Americans spend,\nsave, and invest has profound consequences for the financial industry, the broader economy, and, of\ncourse, American families. Understanding consumer finance patterns — how they change and how they\nwill continue to evolve — is vital to the Federal Reserve’s mission of fostering an economy where\neveryone can prosper.\nAnd speaking of the Federal Reserve, here is where I give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I\nexpress today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nI think we all know that the COVID-19 pandemic changed a lot about American society. Some changes,\nsuch as our inability to convene for events like this one, were thankfully fleeting. But in many areas, the\npandemic simply accelerated changes that were already taking place, and it is quite natural to think that\nthose changes are more likely to remain. To disentangle the fleeting from the long lasting, we need to\nlook at how consumer finance was already changing prior to the pandemic and how the American\npeople — and the institutions that serve them — reacted to the unprecedented circumstances of the\npandemic.\nToday I’ll share some of what we’ve seen in the realms of liquidity, spending, and adoption of new\nfinancial tools over the last few years.\nLiquidity\nI’d like to begin by considering the effect of the pandemic on Americans’ access to liquidity, primarily in\nthe form of cash holdings and checking account balances. A staggering 20 million workers lost their jobs\nin April 2020, and while many were rapidly rehired, total employment only returned to pre-pandemic\nlevels two years later. Data collected in November 2020 in the CFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers\nindicated that more than half of the respondents had experienced some type of disruption to their\nemployment or income since the beginning of the pandemic. As we know, one of the principal federal\nresponses to the crisis was to provide direct stimulus payments (through the CARES Act) and enhanced\nunemployment benefits to Americans. How did these relief measures pass through to consumers’\nwallets?\n\n2\n\n\fThe pandemic certainly made life unpredictable; we can all attest to that. The Diary of Consumer\nPayment Choice found that consumers continued to demand cash in that uncertain environment. This\nFederal Reserve survey showed that, on average, consumers held 25 percent more cash in their wallets\nin 2020 than they did in 2019. This figure dropped in 2021 to be more in line with pre-pandemic levels.\nSimilarly, consumers held more cash at home, in the car, or elsewhere in both 2020 and in 2021 than\nthey did in 2019 by significant amounts.\nTurning to checking account balances, the Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances showed a generally rising\ntrend in checking and similar balances through 2019, but unfortunately, the timing of that triennial\nsurvey did not align well with the crisis.\nI would instead turn to some of the most timely information available on balances in consumer checking\naccounts during the pandemic, published by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. The underlying data are\nbased on a representative sample of their checking account customers. Keeping in mind that those\ncustomers may not be entirely representative of checking or deposit account holders in general, it still\nprovides some illuminating information.\nAccording to the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the median balance in checking accounts increased\nsignificantly from late 2019, spiking at various times matching the largest disbursements of stimulus\nfunds, enhanced unemployment support, and tax refunds. While this phenomenon occurred broadly\nacross their study population, some of the largest increases were seen in the more vulnerable groups.\nDespite this seemingly positive news, it’s important to keep in mind that many of these changes were\nthe result of temporary relief measures implemented by the government. It is unlikely that permanent\nchange takes hold in the overall liquidity of households, particularly of lower-income households. In\nJune 2022, median checking account balances remained significantly higher than they were in 2019, but\nthey were also significantly lower than their peak values realized in March 2021. And while many lowincome consumers had some of the largest increases, a sizable share have average balances lower in\nmid-2022 than prior to the pandemic. As we move further into the post-pandemic economy, it will be\ncrucial to understand which phenomena are likely to revert to the previous norms and which are\nsustainable, and for whom.\n\n3\n\n\fPayments\nWe saw quite profound changes in the way Americans made payments throughout the pandemic. These\nshifts speak to the adaptability of the American people and the financial system during unprecedented\ncircumstances. However, it is also true that many of these changes were already in motion prior to the\npandemic.\nLet me now take a moment to describe what we were seeing before the pandemic. Up until the end of\n2019, there was a gradual decline in the share of consumer transactions that used cash for payments,\nand a much more rapid decline in the number and value of paper checks used to make payments. ACH\ntransactions — typically direct deposit and some bill payments — were growing but no longer as quickly\nas they had over previous decades.\nUnmistakable was the rapid growth in the number and value of credit and debit card payments. Among\nthose, consumer purchases online, typically made by credit and debit cards, outpaced card transactions\nused for in-store purchases. Finally, contactless card payments, digital wallets, and peer-to-peer (P2P)\npayments facilitated by companies like Zelle and Venmo, while still relatively uncommon, were clearly\ngrowing.\nThen COVID-19 hit. And like so much else, the way Americans spent changed drastically.\nThe Federal Reserve Payments Study did a comprehensive job describing the shifts in noncash payments\nthat occurred in the first year of the pandemic. For one, the number of card payments — credit, debit,\nand prepaid — declined in 2020. This was unprecedented. The total dollar value of card payments grew\nslightly, but that growth was well below trend. Industry sources confirm that the weakness was\nprimarily in credit cards. In fact, the value of debit transactions increased substantially in 2020, relative\nto 2019. This shift from credit to debit cards began to reverse in late 2021, with the value of credit\ntransactions growing more rapidly than debit.\nUnpacking these top-level shifts, the mix of in-person and remote payments also changed in these early\npandemic years: In 2018, the total value of in-person and remote payments were about the same, but in\n2020, the value of remote payments exceeded that of in-person card payments by 10 percentage points.\nThis may be a more persistent change because while consumers have resumed going to restaurants and\n\n4\n\n\fgrocery stores, they appear to be still making relatively fewer in-person payments in those locations,\npossibly because they can pay remotely and then pick up their goods.\nThe pandemic also appears to have contributed to significant growth in several recent payment\ninnovations. The growth in the use of contactless cards, for instance, accelerated even while the number\nof in-person payments declined. Contactless payments now account for 4.6 percent of the number of inperson payments, more than double its share in 2019. There was a similar effect for P2P payments and\ndigital wallets. In the first half of 2020, 18 percent of deposit accounts experienced their first P2P\npayment, and 11 percent of credit or debit card accounts experienced their first digital wallet payment. I\ndo not expect these changes to reverse.\nWe talked about cash as a means of storing liquidity, but what about cash as a means of payment? To\nexamine those trends, we look again to the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice. The latest summaries of\nthis survey report that the share of payment transactions made with cash has been falling over time, fell\nprecipitously in 2020, and then actually rose slightly in 2021 as in-person transactions picked up. A bit of\na roller coaster, then. But the bottom line is that the cash share of payments remains well below prepandemic levels — this being a clear example of the pandemic accelerating change that was already in\nmotion.\nFinally, as is often the case, we can learn the most by going directly to the source — in this case, the\nconsumers. Late last year, the Philadelphia Fed’s CFI did just that, asking consumers whether they were\nusing specific forms of payment more or less than they were in 2021. On net, consumers reported using\ncash and checks less and contactless cards more. They also indicated they were using P2P apps and\nmobile payment apps more frequently. As is typically the case, younger consumers tend to be the most\nlikely adopters of payment innovations. Roughly speaking, this suggests that indeed the pandemic\naccelerated the longer-run trends of declining use for paper forms of payment and a more robust\nadoption of new, electronic ways of making payments.\nCryptocurrency\nAnd now for something that can’t get lost between a seat cushion: the latest newcomers to the\nlandscape, cryptocurrencies. As you surely know, cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies (such\nas Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and many others) in which transactions are verified and records are\n\n5\n\n\fmaintained by a decentralized, distributed ledger system using cryptography, rather than by a\ncentralized authority.\nSince the early 2010s, the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies has received significant attention from\nfinancial market participants, policymakers, and academics.\nCryptocurrencies have been marketed in a variety of ways. Early in their existence, they were touted as\na more secure and anonymous method of payment, and a means of keeping funds out of the traditional\nbanking system, while recent messaging has shifted to their value as an investment vehicle.\nCryptocurrency markets have gained a reputation for high volatility in recent years, with rapid price\nincreases and decreases over relatively short periods. For a considerable stretch of time, beginning in\nearly 2019, prices trended up significantly, leading to a perception of cryptocurrencies as lucrative\ninvestment vehicles. Beginning in early 2022, however, the cryptocurrency market experienced what is\ndescribed by some as a crypto winter, a prolonged bear market that resulted in a nearly $2 trillion loss in\nmarket value, coin and exchange collapses, and damage to a number of financial services firms that are\nclosely aligned to the crypto space.\nIn January 2022, CFI, in conjunction with economists from the Federal Reserve Board, included\nquestions related to cryptocurrency ownership and opinions in the CFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers.\nThe survey gave us a basic understanding of the adoption of, and attitudes toward, cryptocurrencies\namong the survey population, with special attention paid to differences across demographic groups. The\nresults of that survey are found in a CFI Research Brief published in December and available on the\nPhiladelphia Fed’s website.\nIn the months since that survey was conducted, the drastic change in prices and associated turmoil —\nagain, the recent period referred to as a crypto winter — likely contributed to a shift in attitudes\nregarding cryptocurrencies among owners and nonowners alike. Therefore, in October 2022, we again\nsurveyed consumers to see how perceptions of cryptocurrencies had changed. I’d like to share some\nhighlights from our published report and touch on some new, previously unpublished, information\nbased on the new survey.\nIn the survey fielded last January, we found that almost one-quarter of respondents, or someone in their\nimmediate family, owned cryptocurrency at that time. Most current crypto owners had acquired those\nassets recently. More than two-thirds of crypto owners last January had acquired their first crypto assets\n6\n\n\fwithin the previous 12 months, almost a third in the previous six months. This surge in adoption took\nplace in a media environment that saw massive increases in the marketing of cryptocurrencies during\n2021. Unlike many of the other changes discussed, the rise of cryptocurrency does not seem to be\ndirectly related to the pandemic, though an environment of low rates, ample liquidity, and, quite\nfrankly, more time at home may have all contributed.\nThe survey asked owners about why they chose to purchase crypto. Just under 30 percent of crypto\nowners cited financial reasons, though some viewed their purchases as short-term investments in\nanticipation of rapid appreciation, while others were looking for long-term investments for stable\ngrowth. Almost one-quarter of crypto owners had acquired their assets out of simple curiosity, and just\nunder 20 percent suggested their decision was influenced either by family or social media. A relatively\nsmall share of crypto owners — around 15 percent — suggested they had acquired their assets primarily\nbecause they expected to use them for transactional purposes.\nWe also asked about future crypto purchase plans. In January 2022, slightly more than half of the\nexisting crypto owners (55 percent) said they were likely to buy more crypto. Nonowners remained\nskeptical, with less than 7 percent of them saying they were likely to buy crypto in the future.\nDemographic analysis of crypto ownership for the most part conforms with our usual expectations. For\nexample, crypto ownership is relatively more common among younger respondents and respondents\nreporting higher incomes. This is consistent with research suggesting that these are categories of\nconsumers who are more likely to be early adopters of new financial tools and technologies. Similarly,\nthe likelihood of owning crypto assets was higher among respondents who were also engaged in mobile\nand P2P payments or mobile banking.\nMen were more likely than women to own crypto assets. Black and Hispanic respondents were more\nlikely to own crypto assets than White respondents.\nNow let’s turn to what we learned when we examined the responses from consumers in the more\nrecent October 2022 survey. Keep in mind that respondents to the January survey had yet to go through\nthe crypto winter, while the October respondents had already lived through most of it. And it shows.\nCrypto ownership among respondents decreased significantly, from 25 percent in January 2022 to 19\npercent in October. We observed decreases in the rate of ownership across nearly all demographic\ngroups. Nevertheless, the relative concentration of crypto ownership across the population changed\n7\n\n\flittle: Younger, male, more affluent, or non-White consumers remain the most engaged demographic\ngroups with crypto.\nFuture plans to purchase more crypto assets cooled, with less than 40 percent of October’s owners\nindicating that they will likely buy more in the future. Remember that, in January, more than half of\nrespondents said they had future plans to purchase more crypto.\nDespite the crypto winter, short- and long-term investment remain the most commonly chosen reasons\nfor buying crypto. Indeed, these reasons seem to have become more important. In October, 35 percent\nof crypto owners cited long-term growth as a principal reason for owning; that is an increase from 29\npercent of crypto owners last January. Somewhat less surprisingly, crypto owners in October were less\nlikely to cite social reasons for holding these assets than were crypto owners last January.\nInterestingly, curiosity remained strong as a purchase reason, increasing from 24 percent of crypto\nowners in January to nearly 30 percent of crypto owners in October. We see this as an indicator that\nthere is still interest among consumers in cryptocurrencies, with the depressed prices of the crypto\nwinter possibly providing an opportunity to satisfy that interest for some.\nWhat do we take from these data? In many ways, it is what we would expect to see from a market after\na downturn: Participation and interest in the market both decreased as groups of consumers shy away\nfrom risk. The strength of investment and experimentation as reasons for participation in the market has\nremained steady and the socioeconomic groups most likely to acquire cryptocurrencies haven’t\nmaterially changed. These patterns seem to suggest that cryptocurrencies will remain in demand by\ncertain consumers despite the recent crypto winter.\nConclusion\nSo, I realize I’ve thrown a lot of data at you. And although we are convening in a college town today, I\npromise there won’t be a quiz. But I am going to assign some homework. Have a look at the Consumer\nFinance section on the Philadelphia Fed website; you’ll find some very interesting work there.\nWhat I do think is that these data offer unique insights about the way American society responded to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented strain. It allows us to discern which changes are likely to\nbe fleeting and which ones were already in motion prior to the pandemic and are likely to be long\nlasting.\n8\n\n\fWe saw how pandemic-era policies and lifestyle shifts led to a run-up in household liquidity; however,\noverall, this run-up is not likely to be sustainable for everyone.\nWe saw Americans embrace new ways of making payments as they, first, shifted to online shopping, and\nthen made changes to their payment habits that apparently have real staying power.\nAnd we’ve seen how consumers responded to dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency markets, slowing,\nbut likely not reversing, the growth of that sector in the coming years.\nWhat we have yet to see is how these shifts will play out in the long run — and how they will affect the\nFederal Reserve’s solemn responsibility of fostering an economy where all Americans can thrive.\nSo, thanks again for having me. Now let’s get to the discussion.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fEconomic Outlook\nNew Jersey Bankers Annual Leadership Forum\nSomerset, NJ\nJanuary 20, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s great to be here. As a lifelong Jersey boy, I’m very glad to be with a group of my\nfellow New Jerseyans. Though as a lifelong South Jersey boy, I’m not so sure how I feel about doing this\nway up here in Somerset.\nI plan to talk a bit about the country’s economic outlook and my approach to monetary policy. Then we\ncan get to questions, which I’m really looking forward to.\nBut before we do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nHow We Got Here\nAs we begin, I think it’s worth taking a step back and considering, briefly, how much has transpired over\nthe past several years. You really can’t understand where our economy is, or where it’s going, without\nconsidering where we’ve come from.\nFirst and foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has\nendured because of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 7.5 million people globally\nhave perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and 35,000 New\nJerseyans. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our\nlifetimes.\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of\nthe pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus\nspread and state and local governments shuttered businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of\n1\n\n\fmillions of Americans were thrown into joblessness in one of the sharpest recessions in American\nhistory.\nThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened\nrestrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed\nand deployed.\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had\nopted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before\nCOVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill,\nand by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial items\nlike computer chips in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal spending from the federal\ngovernment and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve stoked demand. This led to\na phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few goods” and the highest inflation\nin four decades.\nWhere We Are Nationally\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means\ndisproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and\nshelter have skyrocketed in price.\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Last year, we raised the target for the federal\nfunds rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. That was a significant move, and a very fast one,\ngiven that we started the year at about 0 percent. I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this\nyear, though, to my mind, the days of us raising them 75 basis points at a time have surely passed. In my\nview, hikes of 25 basis points will be appropriate going forward.\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in\nplace to let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a\nsignificant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\nOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal\nReserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, or an endemic shortage of workers, though\n2\n\n\fit does seem like these problems are finally easing a bit. But we can affect demand by making it more\nexpensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening: We’re seeing unmistakable signs of a\nslowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling,\nthe national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly\neven as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans\nare still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered the most during the pandemic, like\nleisure and hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing are\ncooling somewhat. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and\nhybrid work is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban\noffice parks.\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created\n4.5 million jobs, and while we are seeing scattered layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little\nevidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, a record number of Americans are employed.\nAnd indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.5 percent.\nWhere We Are Locally\nIn New Jersey, conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, this region’s economy\nreflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing, but\nmaintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug along,\nunemployment claims have stayed low, and the unemployment rate has continued to drop. In fact, in\nthe state of New Jersey, the unemployment rate stands at 3.4 percent — effectively, full employment.\nAs of the third quarter of 2022, wages were up nearly 5 percent year over year in the Philadelphia–\nReading–Camden region.\nOur state’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is manufacturing.\nResponses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, which partially\ncovers New Jersey, suggested overall declines in the sector in January. The survey’s indicators for\ncurrent general activity and new orders remained negative, and the survey’s future indicators suggest\ntempered expectations for growth over the next six months.\n3\n\n\fHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Single-family price\ngrowth in New Jersey is trending downward and was only around 9.5 percent year over year in\nNovember 2022, well down from the double-digit price growth we experienced during the pandemic.\nAccording to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut has increased over the past year and was 22.7\npercent in the Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and 14.3 percent in the New York City\nMSA as of December. In October, meanwhile, the median days on the market for a house for sale in New\nJersey was 51 days, compared with less than 30 days in May 2021, showcasing softening conditions.\nWhere We Are Going\nIn happier news, we are finally starting to see steady progress bringing inflation down across an array of\ngoods. With monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I\nforecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but\nsuggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and\nthen back down to 2 percent in 2025.\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to\nindicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year\nbefore climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out at about 4.5\npercent this year, before falling back toward 4 percent over the next two years. It’s an underrated\nadvantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions\nfor a healthy labor market. Given that you are bankers, I would also mention something I always keep in\nmind as a policymaker: When uncertainty abounds, it pays to be cautious. Just as I, as a member of the\nFOMC, am working to minimize risk, I also urge you all to think about the risks your clients face and to\nmake good decisions to guard against any possible losses.\nSo again, thanks so much for having me. Now let’s get to your questions.\n\n4\n\n\f"

I had many very happy years as president here, though I did\nrecall the one downside to working here as I made my way down I-95 this afternoon: the traffic.\nIn all seriousness, it’s really an honor to be here for today’s event.

In fact, a record number of Americans are employed.\nAnd indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.5 percent.\nWhere We Are Going\nBut there’s more good news: We are starting to see inflation come down across a spectrum of goods.\nAnd so, with monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I\nforecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year. I want to be clear: This is well over our\n2 percent target. But it is suggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall\nto 2.5 percent in 2024 and then back down to 2 percent in 2025.\n\n3\n\n\fGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession.

It’s an underrated\nadvantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative\nNow, in the remaining few minutes, I’d like to talk a little bit about an exciting new initiative from the\nPhiladelphia Fed called the Anchor Economy Initiative. It’s fitting that we are convening here on the\nSTAR Campus today because this place exemplifies the Anchor Economy Initiative perfectly.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative seeks to quantify the economic impact of higher education institutions\nand hospitals — eds and meds — that we call the anchor institutions in their communities.\nThis is vital work. Anchor institutions are often the largest employers in regions, they’re the producers of\ntalent that other businesses need, and they lay the foundation for durable economic growth.\nThey also have characteristics that other institutions just don’t. For one, even though they’ve made\nsizable leaps in their use of technology in recent years — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic —\nhigher education institutions and hospitals are physically embedded in their communities. In fact, that’s\none of the reasons we call them anchor institutions. Unlike corporate headquarters, manufacturing\nfacilities, or sports teams that can pick up and move, higher education institutions and hospitals tend to\nstay where they are. Hospitals and higher education also tend to be labor intensive, meaning they are\noften among the largest employers in their regions.\nEds and meds also serve as bulwarks against the ups and downs of the business cycle. Enrollment in\ncolleges and universities, for instance, is countercyclical, meaning that when the economy slows,\nusually more people go to school, boosting anchor institutions. Hospitals are also recession resistant;\nafter all, people require medical care no matter how the local economy is faring. All of which suggests\nthat regions with strong anchor institutions may have more durable economies than those without.\n\n4\n\n\fAnd in recent years, we’ve also seen anchor institutions take an increasing interest in building up the\nareas they serve. They are typically critical partners in community development initiatives. We’ve seen\nmore hospitals and universities invest in neighborhood economic development, boosting local\ncommercial corridors, seeding residential real estate development, and building neighborhood\namenities.\nAnchor institutions’ impact goes beyond the immediate. This is a key point that I really want to stress.\nFundamentally, anchor institutions stimulate growth through innovation, commercialization, new\nventure formation, and talent attraction. In that sense, they can drive long-term economic development\nand growth.\nLet’s not sugarcoat things, though. Eds and meds are both being radically disrupted by technology,\ndemographic shifts, and increasing costs. As I alluded to earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated\nboth telehealth and remote learning. This has certainly created opportunities for health systems and\nuniversities to expand their markets, but it also loosened the place-based nature of their services.\nSuddenly, these anchors are, frankly, a little less anchored.\nDemographics are another downside risk, though with disparate impacts for universities and hospitals.\nWith falling birth rates, fewer 18-year-olds are heading to college and even fewer will enroll in the\nfuture, especially if immigration rates remain depressed, as they are now. This demographic shift is most\napparent in the Northeast and Midwest, which also happen to have higher concentrations of colleges\nand universities. That raises real questions about the viability of many of these institutions in the future\n— and the impact that will have on communities.\nOn the other hand, an aging population is one that will require more health care, boosting hospitals.\nEven here, however, the picture is mixed, as many hospitals have closed over the past several years.\nMeanwhile, the ever-rising cost of education and health care means that more people may be priced\nout of accessing eds and meds altogether, which is both a humanitarian concern and an economic one.\nThat’s why, at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve developed what we call the Anchor Economy Dashboard, a\nnew tool that quantifies the impact of higher education institutions and hospitals on more than 500\nregions across the country.\n\n5\n\n\fFor each of these regions, the dashboard calculates the total number of jobs — direct, indirect, or\ninduced — supported by local eds and meds institutions. Direct jobs comprise those employed directly\nby anchor institutions, like doctors, nurses, and college professors. Indirect are those working in fields\nthat directly support anchor institutions, like IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced jobs are\nthose that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate.\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance\nindex for each region. The reliance index provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional\neconomy is on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and\nincorporates measures of impact in terms of employment, income, and gross value added. A reliance\nindex of 1 means a region’s reliance on anchor institutions is at the national average — below that\nmeans it’s less reliant, and above that means it’s more reliant.\nOn a national scale, the dashboard clearly shows what I’ve been talking about: The economic impact of\nanchor institutions is massive; 9 percent of total U.S. employment, 6.3 percent of total U.S. income, and\n8.1 percent of total U.S. gross value added comes from higher education institutions and hospitals. That\ntranslates to 18.2 million jobs, $1.1 trillion in income, and $1.7 trillion in gross value added to the\neconomy.\nFor Delaware, our data support what I suspect a lot of us know intuitively: This state is quite reliant on\nanchor institutions. So, while Delaware’s total employment in eds and meds ranks 46th out of 50 states\nand the District of Columbia, that is largely a result of the state having a small population. Delaware’s\nreliance index, we calculate, is 1.23. In other words, Delaware overindexes on eds and meds\nemployment, income, and gross value added, compared with other regions. Delaware is 23 percent\nmore dependent on eds and meds for jobs, income, and gross value added than the United States as a\nwhole.\nConclusion\nI urge you all — after today’s program — to head over to philadelphiafed.org to delve into the\ndashboard. We have data for 524 regions across the U.S. — truly a treasure trove. I think you’ll find the\ninformation there useful and important.\n\n6\n\n\fIn closing, I’d like to reiterate my thanks to you for attending, and the Federal Reserve’s strong\ncommitment to bringing down inflation. Now let’s get on to the discussion.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s great to be here with so many friends from the chamber and elsewhere. And after a\ncouple of years of virtual events, it’s particularly gratifying to see all of you in 3D! Thanks so much for\nhaving me. It’s truly an honor and a pleasure.\nOf course, given that so many of you are old friends, I’m sure you know what I’m about to say next.\nThat’s right, it’s time for the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nIn a few minutes, I’ll be on a panel devoted to forecasting what 2023 holds in store for our national and\nlocal economies. But, to my mind, you can’t hope to predict what will happen in the future without\nhaving an accurate perception of what’s going on right now.\nThat’s where the Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia’s annual member survey comes in.\nThis survey — and thank you to all who participated — is an invaluable tool for understanding what’s\nhappening right now in the real economy. I hope you all have had a chance to look at the results\nbecause they really do tell us a lot.\nSurvey data are an important tool in the economic business. At the Fed, we look at everything from big\nbroad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures like restaurant reservations\nand mobility data. These data — hard data — tell us a lot.\nBut as a policymaker, I’ve come to believe that soft data like survey results are perhaps equally\nimportant to getting a full understanding of our economic situation. Candidly, an overemphasis on hard\n1\n\n\fdata can lead to policy errors; last year, hard data suggested to us that inflation would be “transitory,”\nwhereas the soft data we were hearing from our contacts indicated that rising prices were proving more\npersistent than we may have expected. Which is to say, paying due attention to soft data is vitally\nimportant to effective policymaking.\nSo again, I hope you will take a few minutes to delve into the survey results. But in the meantime, I want\nto share a few insights that I found particularly important.\nOverall, members reported strong activity in both the region and for their businesses in 2022 compared\nwith 2021. However, expectations for 2023 were mixed. While firms remained somewhat optimistic for\ntheir own operations, they also expressed uncertainty over the expected economic performance of the\nbroader region.\nNot surprisingly — and unfortunately — a vast majority of respondents reported higher prices paid in\n2022 than in 2021. To offset these increased costs, most respondents reported higher prices received in\n2022 than in 2021. Most respondents expect prices to continue to rise this year.\nTurning to the labor market, firms reported having more full-time employees on their payrolls in 2022\nthan during the year prior. While there were a few firms that laid off some of their employees, that\nrepresented a very small percentage of respondents.\nFirms’ wages and benefit costs rose, with nearly all respondents reporting slightly or significantly higher\nlabor costs in 2022 than the year before. Respondents also expect increases to persist into 2023.\nMembers reported that hiring has been a challenge, particularly because of the level of compensation\nbeing demanded by applicants. To hire new workers or retain existing staff, many respondents have\nraised compensation, introduced a remote work policy, or promoted existing employees.\nGiven this backdrop, it’s not surprising that labor was cited as a top concern by many respondents.\nChamber members also cited the availability of financing and interest rates as pressing concerns. This,\ntoo, is no surprise, given changes in monetary policy over the past year.\nSo, I think all in all, you can say respondents have painted a picture of mixed economic conditions. I’d\nexpect similarly mixed conditions in the year ahead, which we can delve into during the panel\ndiscussion. While I recognize forecasting can be a tricky business, I’m very excited for the discussion.\n\n2\n\n\fI will add that one forecast I’m fully confident in making at this point is that the Eagles will soon embark\non a remarkable playoff run.\nAgain, thank you so much for having me.\n\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fThe Local and National Economic Outlook\nThe Main Line Chamber of Commerce Economic Forecast 2023 and Annual Meeting\nMalvern, PA\nJanuary 12, 2023\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s great to see you all here. I was reminded before today’s breakfast that I was here for\nthe last in-person event that the Main Line chamber hosted prior to the pandemic, back in February\n2020.\nAnd it’s great to be back. I plan to speak a bit about the economic outlook for the country and our\nregion, and then we can get to your questions, which I’m really looking forward to.\nBut first, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nHow We Got Here\nIf we take a step back, it’s quite remarkable how much has transpired since we were last together. First\nand foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has endured\nbecause of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 7.5 million people globally have\nperished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and 50,000\nPennsylvanians. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our\nlifetimes.\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of\nthe pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus\nspread and state and local governments shuttered businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of\nmillions of Americans were thrown into joblessness in one of the sharpest recessions in American\nhistory.\n1\n\n\fThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened\nrestrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed\nand deployed.\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had\nopted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before\nCOVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill,\nand by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial items\nlike computer chips in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal spending from the federal\ngovernment and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve stoked demand. This led to\na phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few goods” and the highest inflation\nin four decades.\nWhere We Are Nationally\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means\ndisproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and\nshelter have skyrocketed in price.\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Last year, we raised the target for the federal\nfunds rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. That was a significant move, and a very fast one,\ngiven that we started the year at about 0 percent. I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this\nyear, though, to my mind, the days of us raising them 75 basis points at a time have surely passed. In my\nview, hikes of 25 basis points will be appropriate going forward.\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in\nplace to let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a\nsignificant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\nOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal\nReserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, or an endemic shortage of workers, though\nit does seem like these problems are finally easing a bit. But we can affect demand by making it more\n\n2\n\n\fexpensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening: We’re seeing unmistakable signs of a\nslowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing.\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling,\nthe national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly\neven as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans\nare still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered most during the pandemic, like leisure\nand hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing, are cooling\nsomewhat. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and hybrid\nwork is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban office\nparks.\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created\n4.5 million jobs, and while we are seeing scattered layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little\nevidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, a record number of Americans are employed.\nAnd indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.5 percent.\nWhere We Are Locally\nLocal conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, the Philadelphia area’s economy\nreflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing, but\nmaintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug along,\nunemployment claims have stayed low, and the unemployment rate has continued to drop. In fact, in\nthe Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area, the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent —\neffectively, full employment. As of the third quarter of 2022, wages were up nearly 5 percent year over\nyear in the Philadelphia–Reading–Camden region.\nOf course, even in a hot job market, some positions remain more in demand than others. According to\nan analysis of job listings for the Philadelphia area, some of the most frequent job ads are for registered\nnurses, retail salespeople, software developers, and customer service representatives, reflecting\ncontinued hot demand in health care, tech, and retail. I continue to see biotech as a key growth industry\nin our region as well, with firms unable to build wet labs fast enough. That’s driving labor demand not\nonly for PhDs and college graduates, but also those with high school diplomas.\n3\n\n\fNow, our region’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is\nmanufacturing. Responses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey\nsuggested continuing declines in the sector. The survey’s indicators for general activity, new orders, and\nshipments were all negative, and manufacturing firms reported a decline in employment, on balance.\nHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Home price\ngrowth in Philadelphia County is trending downward and was only around 5 percent year over year in\nSeptember 2022. Nearby counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey have higher home price growth,\nranging between 8 percent and 20 percent, respectively, well below the huge gains logged during the\npandemic. According to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut in the Philadelphia metro area has\nincreased over the past several months and was up by more than a quarter in November. In October,\nmeanwhile, the median days on the market for a house for sale in the Philadelphia metro area was 38\ndays. This is closing in on the typical prepandemic figure, which was 41 days, showcasing a softening in\nconditions. The days of houses selling before they are even listed are in our rearview mirror. So, sorry to\nall the realtors in the audience this morning.\nWhere We Are Going\nAlso in the rearview mirror, I expect, are the eye-popping inflation readings of 2022. With monetary\npolicy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I forecast core inflation to\ncome in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but suggestive of clear\nmovement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and then back down to\n2 percent in 2025.\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to\nindicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year\nbefore climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out at about 4.5\npercent this year, before falling back toward 4 percent over the next two years. It’s an underrated\nadvantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\nConclusion\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions\nfor a healthy labor market.\n4\n\n\fThanks so much for having me. Let’s hope it’s not another three years before we see each other again.\nNow, let’s get to your questions.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fInflation, Monetary Policy, and the Anchor Economy Initiative\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nNovember 15, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s great to see you all in person, and it’s great to be in University City. And, of course,\ncongratulations, George! Your award is very well deserved.\nI’d like to take a few minutes this morning to discuss the national economy, inflation, monetary policy,\nand an exciting new research initiative from the Philadelphia Fed. And then, we can get to your\nquestions. But please, nothing about baseball: The wounds are still too fresh.\nBefore I can go any further, I need to give you the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Economy\nLet’s begin with the national economy, where there are signs that activity is decelerating. Credit card\npurchase data indicate that consumer spending, which comprises around 70 percent of economic\nactivity in the United States, is slowing, with services and retail leading the decline. Investment in\nhousing has weakened, and even the boom in manufacturing, which has buoyed the economy, is\nstarting to wane.\nAfter two negative quarters of GDP growth to start the year, the third quarter saw growth of 2.6\npercent. That growth was largely due to strong exports. In sum, the reopening boom we experienced as\nbusinesses came back to life after a pandemic-induced hibernation appears to be pretty much over.\nThere is one glaring exception to this rather lackluster data set: employment. The job market continues\nto run extremely hot. The national unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, and we still have more than 10\nmillion unfilled jobs. All of which is to say, one economic category has certainly not suffered even as\nother sectors have slowed: Help Wanted signs.\n1\n\n\fInflation\nNow to inflation, which remains far, far too high.\nThe Federal Reserve’s long-range target is 2 percent annualized inflation, and right now, annualized PCE\ninflation, including food and energy, stands at 6.2 percent. Prices were up 0.3 percent in September\nfrom just a month before. Moreover, inflation is widespread throughout the economy, with numerous\ncategories continuing to register hefty increases.\nThis is a period of tremendous hardship for Americans, particularly those of low or moderate income. I\nfind it particularly alarming that we’re seeing rapid price increases in life’s true essentials, like food, rent,\nhealth care, and gasoline.\nThe bottom line is that we can’t have a well-functioning economy with high inflation, particularly if high\ninflation expectations get embedded. To make the economy as efficient as we can in the long run, we\nhave to get on top of inflation.\nWe are committed to bringing down inflation.\nTo do so effectively, we need to understand what has caused it. A global pandemic, a war in Europe, and\nfiscal and monetary policy decisions have combined to limit supply and boost demand. The result has\nbeen inflation running at 40-year highs.\nLet’s begin with constraints on supply.\nCOVID-19 pandemic lockdowns have badly damaged supply chains. We all know about semiconductor\nshortages, which have limited supplies of everything from new cars to washing machines. These\nshortages persist, owing largely to China’s Zero-COVID policy. But the pandemic has wrought shortages\nin more obscure items. A major auto company, for instance, is having a hard time securing enough of its\ntrademark emblems, which has in turn slowed shipments of new vehicles.\nRussia’s horrific invasion of Ukraine further choked supply.\nAfter Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine, shipments of grain and fertilizer fell, pushing up food\nprices. The decline in Russia’s energy exports has helped fuel the rise in energy prices, causing an energy\ncrisis in Europe and the U.K. Gasoline prices spiked here, fell a bit, and are now back up again. OPEC Plus\nhas further compounded our problems by announcing it will cut production, even in the face of elevated\nprices. We know that gas prices are incredibly important to consumers and responsible for much of the\ndecline in consumer sentiment.\n2\n\n\fCertain U.S. government policies have contributed to our supply-side issues. While I remain neutral on\nthe overall wisdom of each of these policies, their effect on supply is undeniable. The federal\ngovernment applies tariffs on everything from Chinese-made televisions to Canadian lumber. Our\nimmigration policy, such as it is, has resulted in a more than two-year pause in legal immigration. As a\nresult, we have about 2½ million fewer workers than we would have had, if we had remained on trend.\nAll of these supply constraints have been accompanied by robust demand. For one, as I indicated earlier,\nour labor market remains hot. That means Americans are earning paychecks, even if their relative value\nis declining because of inflation.\nNot surprisingly, low unemployment rates have produced significant upward pressure on wages. In\nmany regions, smaller employers with thin margins are having a hard time filling entry-level positions.\nWe’ve heard from community bankers who can’t compete with larger banks for jobs like tellers.\nFiscal policy has added to demand. The federal government pumped around $6 trillion into American\nhouseholds during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic through programs like mortgage\nforbearance and student loan forbearance. In fact, the amount of fiscal support provided by the federal\ngovernment was significantly larger than the aggregate decline in GDP triggered by the pandemic in the\nfirst place.\nThat aid was also dispersed in a largely untargeted fashion. That’s understandable, of course: We were\nin the middle of a full-blown panic, and the federal government needed to get money out the door. But\nit’s clear that policies like these contributed to high levels of demand.\nMonetary Policy\nAnd finally, expansive monetary policy — that’s us — kept the cost of capital low, which stoked demand.\nThroughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and enacted a major asset-buying\nprogram.\nAs a central bank, the Federal Reserve can do little to affect the supply constraints pushing up inflation.\nAnd as I have indicated, those problems, unfortunately, will take time to resolve.\nBut the Federal Reserve can absolutely affect demand, and that is what we are doing. We want to see\ninflation coming down steadily and consistently, and we also want to see it abating across a wide array\nof goods and services. The goal is to adjust conditions so that demand better matches supply.\n\n3\n\n\fWe have two primary tools for implementing monetary policy: the federal funds rate and our balance\nsheet.\nSince last fall, we have been tightening financial conditions. That process, at least as the market\ninterpreted it, started last September, even before we began to move the federal funds rate or taper\nour asset purchases. Instead, simply announcing that we would soon begin to taper our asset purchases\ncaused two-year Treasury yields to rise.\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. In fact, we are now reducing our\nbalance sheet. We are shedding $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities each month. Which is to say, we are removing a significant amount of financial\naccommodation quite rapidly.\nWe have also raised the federal funds rate 375 basis points since the start of the year. Granted, we\nstarted from zero, but we have raised rates significantly — and very quickly.\nIn the upcoming months, in light of the cumulative tightening we have achieved, I expect we will slow\nthe pace of our rate hikes as we approach a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I want to be clear: A rate\nhike of 50 basis points would still be significant. Since 1983, the FOMC has increased the target a total of\n88 times, and of those, 75 of the hikes were less than 50 basis points.\nAt some point next year, I expect we will hold at a restrictive rate for a while to let monetary policy do\nits work. It will take a while for the higher cost of capital to work its way through the economy.\nAfter that, if we have to, we can always tighten further, based on the data. But we should let the system\nwork itself out. And we also need to recognize that this will take time.\nAbove all, I want to stress that we must remain data dependent and flexible on policy. What we really\nneed to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening\nmonetary policy. And again, we need to make sure inflation expectations don’t become unanchored.\nSo what does all of this mean for the economy? I expect that economic growth will moderate this year\nas both inflation and tightening financial conditions begin to crimp consumption. Overall, I forecast flat\nGDP growth for 2022, 1.5 percent growth in 2023, and around 2 percent growth in 2024.\nInflation will come down, but it will take some time to get to our target. I expect core PCE inflation to\ncome in around 4.8 percent in 2022, around 3.5 percent next year, and 2.5 percent in 2024.\n\n4\n\n\fTurning to the job market, the unemployment rate should peak at 4.5 percent next year as financial\nconditions bite. It should then fall to 4 percent in 2024, which suggests that, even as we tighten\nmonetary policy, labor markets will stay quite healthy. We’ve heard from contacts in manufacturing\nthat, given how hard they have worked to staff up, they will be extremely reluctant to cut jobs even as\nthe economy slows.\nThat gives me confidence that we can bring inflation under control without doing unnecessary damage\nto the labor market. Our resolve is strong, and our goal of stable prices and maximum employment is\nachievable.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative\nNow, in the remaining few minutes, I’d like to describe an exciting new initiative from the Philadelphia\nFed called the Anchor Economy Initiative. It’s fitting that we are convening in University City today\nbecause this place exemplifies the Anchor Economy Initiative perfectly.\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative seeks to quantify the economic impact of higher education institutions\nand hospitals — eds and meds — that we call the anchor institutions in their communities.\nThis is vital work. Anchor institutions are often the largest employers in regions, they’re the producers of\ntalent that other businesses need, and they lay the foundation for durable economic growth.\nThey also have characteristics that other institutions just don’t. For one, even though they’ve made\nsizable leaps in their use of technology in recent years — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic —\nhigher education institutions and hospitals are physically embedded in their communities. In fact, that’s\none of the reasons we call them anchor institutions. Unlike corporate headquarters, manufacturing\nfacilities, or sports teams that can pick up and move, higher education institutions and hospitals tend to\nstay where they are. Hospitals and higher education also tend to be labor intensive, meaning they are\noften among the largest employers in their regions.\nEds and meds also serve as bulwarks against the vicissitudes of the business cycle. Enrollment in colleges\nand universities, for instance, is countercyclical, meaning that when the economy slows, usually more\npeople go to school, boosting anchor institutions. Hospitals are also recession resistant; after all, people\nrequire medical care no matter how the local economy is faring. All of which suggests that regions with\nstrong anchor institutions may have more durable economies than those without.\n\n5\n\n\fAnd in recent years, we’ve also seen anchor institutions take an increasing interest in building up the\nareas they serve. They are typically critical partners in community development initiatives. We’ve seen\nmore hospitals and universities invest in neighborhood economic development, boosting local\ncommercial corridors, seeding residential real estate development, and building neighborhood\namenities. Now I suspect you understand the connection to University City.\nAnchor institutions’ impact goes beyond the immediate. This is a key point that I really want to stress.\nFundamentally, anchor institutions stimulate growth through innovation, commercialization, new\nventure formation, and talent attraction. In that sense, they can drive long-term economic development\nand growth.\nWe see this here in Philadelphia all the time. The talent and research coming out of our universities and\nhealth-care systems have led to the creation of a booming biotechnology industry. Which is to say,\nanchor institutions are not only often the largest employers themselves in regions, they’re also the\nproducers of talent that other businesses need.\nLet’s not sugarcoat things, though. Eds and meds are both being radically disrupted by technology,\ndemographic shifts, and increasing costs. As I alluded to earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated\nboth telehealth and remote learning. This has certainly created opportunities for health systems and\nuniversities to expand their markets, but it also loosened the place-based nature of their services. All of\na sudden, these anchors are, frankly, a little less anchored.\nDemographics are another downside risk, though with disparate impacts for universities and hospitals.\nWith falling birth rates, fewer 18-year-olds are heading to college and even fewer will enroll in the\nfuture, especially if immigration rates remain depressed, as they are now. This demographic shift is most\napparent in the Northeast and Midwest, which also happen to have higher concentrations of colleges\nand universities. That raises real questions about the viability of many of these institutions in the future\n— and the impact that will have on communities.\nOn the other hand, an aging population is one that will require more health care, boosting hospitals.\nEven here, however, the picture is mixed, as many hospitals have closed over the past several years.\nMeanwhile, the ever-rising cost of education and health care means that more people may be priced\nout of accessing eds and meds altogether, which is both a humanitarian concern and an economic one.\n\n6\n\n\fThat’s why, at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve developed what we call the Anchor Economy Dashboard, a\nnew tool that quantifies the impact of higher education institutions and hospitals on more than 500\nregions across the country.\nFor each of these regions, the dashboard calculates the total number of jobs — direct, indirect, or\ninduced — supported by local eds and meds institutions. Direct jobs comprise those employed directly\nby anchor institutions, like doctors, nurses, and college professors. Indirect are those working in fields\nthat directly support anchor institutions, like IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced jobs are\nthose that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate. The folks working at\nthe Last Word Bookshop have induced jobs.\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance\nindex for each region. The reliance index provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional\neconomy is on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and\nincorporates measures of impact in terms of employment, income, and gross value added. A reliance\nindex of 1 means a region’s reliance on anchor institutions is at the national average — below that\nmeans it’s less reliant, and above that means it’s more reliant.\nOn a national scale, the dashboard clearly shows what I’ve been talking about: The economic impact of\nanchor institutions is massive: 9 percent of total U.S. employment, 6.3 percent of total U.S. income, and\n8.1 percent of total U.S. gross value added comes from higher education institutions and hospitals. That\ntranslates to 18.2 million jobs, $1.1 trillion in income, and $1.7 trillion in gross value added to the\neconomy.\nHere in the Philadelphia region, the total economic impact from anchor institutions is more than\n495,000 jobs, $33.8 billion in income, and $51.4 billion in gross value added. That’s nearly 13 percent of\nthe region’s jobs, 8.4 percent of its income, and 11.4 percent of its gross value added. All told, that\namounts to a reliance index of 1.39, indicating that our region is more dependent on anchor institutions\nthan the U.S. average.\nConclusion\nI urge you all — after today’s program — to head over to philadelphiafed.org to delve into the\ndashboard. We have data for 524 regions across the U.S. — truly a treasure trove. I think you’ll find the\ninformation there useful and important.\n\n7\n\n\fIn closing, I’d like to reiterate my thanks to you for joining us, and the Federal Reserve’s strong\ncommitment to bringing down inflation. We will get this job done.\nNow, let’s get to your questions.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s great to see you all in person after two years of virtual meetings. While clicking a\nZoom link is, admittedly, a little bit easier than fighting traffic or dealing with transit, there’s something\nundeniably invigorating about being back together physically. So thanks so much for joining us.\nI’m eager to take your questions, so please use the Slido code indicated on the screen behind me. But\nbefore we get to the open discussion, I’d like to take a few minutes to discuss the state of the national\nand regional economy, inflation, and path of monetary policy.\nBut before I do that, I need to give you the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nor in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Economy\nLet’s begin with the national economy, where there are signs that activity is decelerating. Credit card\npurchase data indicate that consumer spending, which comprises around 70 percent of economic\nactivity in the United States, is slowing, with services and retail leading the decline. Investment in\nhousing has weakened, and even the boom in manufacturing, which has buoyed the economy, is\nstarting to wane.\nAfter two negative quarters of GDP growth to start the year, the third quarter saw growth of 2.6\npercent, and that was largely due to strong exports. In sum, the reopening boom we experienced as\nbusinesses came back to life after a pandemic-induced hibernation appears to be pretty much over.\n\n1\n\n\fThere is one glaring exception to this rather lackluster data set: employment. The job market continues\nto run extremely hot. The national unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, and we still have more than 10\nmillion unfilled jobs. All of which is to say, one economic category has certainly not suffered even as\nother sectors have slowed: Help Wanted signs.\nRegionally, there are signs of weakness as well, though as with the national economy, employment\nremains robust.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey is in negative territory, meaning that\nrespondents are pessimistic regarding the economic environment six months from now. Importantly,\nhowever, shipments remain in positive territory as firms work off sizable order backlogs piled up during\nthe pandemic. In residential real estate, activity has flattened after a huge boom, and we are seeing\nmore prices being reduced for home listings.\nIt also appears that central business districts in our region are going to endure lighter foot traffic in the\nforeseeable future. Employers who have called their workers back to their offices are in many cases\noffering hybrid schedules, and the data reflect this. This trend tends to be more pronounced in our\nregion than nationally. We can see this most clearly in mobility statistics, which indicate time in\nworkplaces is down 20 percent nationally and 30 percent in Philadelphia. For public transit, the drop-off\nis even more stark, with time in transit stations down 20 percent nationally and 45 percent in\nPhiladelphia.\nInflation\nNow to inflation, which remains far, far too high.\nThis is a period of tremendous hardship for Americans, particularly those of low or moderate income.\nWe’re seeing huge demand at food banks — and it’s coming, in many cases, from people who are\nworking full-time. Our contacts in the banking industry are telling us that more families are taking on\nunsecured debt to meet daily expenses.\nThe Federal Reserve’s long-range target is 2 percent annualized inflation, and right now, annualized PCE\ninflation, including food and energy, stands at 6.2 percent. Prices were up 0.3 percent in September\nfrom just a month before. Moreover, inflation is widespread throughout the economy. While initially,\nprice hikes were limited to just a few items like used cars, we’re now seeing rapid rises in prices on\neverything from new vehicles and dishwashers to life’s essentials, like food, health care, and rent.\n\n2\n\n\fMore broadly, we can’t have a well-functioning economy with high inflation, particularly if high inflation\nexpectations get embedded. To make the economy as efficient in the long run as we can, we have to get\non top of inflation.\nTo solve our inflation problem, we need to understand what has caused it. In this case, there is no\nsingular cause. It has instead been a confluence of events — essentially a “perfect storm.”\nA global pandemic, a war in Europe, and, yes, fiscal and monetary policy decisions have combined to\nlimit supply and boost demand. The result has been inflation running at 40-year highs.\nWe are committed to bringing down inflation.\nLet’s begin with constraints on supply.\nThe events of the last few years have revealed the extraordinary fragility of global supply chains. If one\nship, stuck in one canal, could ground global logistics to a halt for days, imagine the effect of a multiyear\nglobal pandemic.\nIn fact, we don’t need to imagine it: COVID-19 lockdowns have badly damaged supply chains. We all\nknow about semiconductor shortages, which have limited supplies of everything from new cars to\nwashing machines. These shortages persist, owing largely to China’s Zero-COVID policy. But the\npandemic has wrought shortages in more obscure items. A major auto company for instance, is having a\nhard time securing enough of its trademark emblems. That has slowed shipments of new vehicles.\nRussia’s horrific invasion of Ukraine further choked supply.\nAfter Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine, shipments of grain and fertilizer fell, pushing up food\nprices. And the decline in Russia’s energy exports has helped fuel the rise in energy prices causing an\nenergy crisis in Europe and the U.K. Gasoline prices spiked here, fell a bit, and are now back up again.\nOPEC Plus has further compounded our problems by announcing it will cut production, even in the face\nof elevated prices. We know that gas prices are incredibly important to consumers and responsible for\nmuch of the decline in consumer sentiment.\nCertain U.S. government policies have contributed to our supply-side issues. While I remain neutral on\nthe overall wisdom of each of these policies, their effect on supply is undeniable. The federal\ngovernment applies tariffs on everything from Chinese-made televisions to Canadian lumber. Our\nimmigration policy, such as it is, has resulted in a more than two-year pause in legal immigration. This\n\n3\n\n\fhas certainly contributed to labor shortages; we have about 2½ million fewer workers than we would\nhave had, if we had remained on trend.\nAll of these supply constraints have been accompanied by robust demand. For one, as I indicated earlier,\nour labor market remains hot. That means Americans are earning paychecks, even if their relative value\nis declining because of inflation.\nNot surprisingly, low unemployment rates have produced significant upward pressure on wages. In\nmany regions, smaller employers with thin margins are having a hard time filling entry-level positions.\nWe’ve heard from community bankers who can’t compete with larger banks for jobs like tellers. In\ntourist regions like the Poconos and the Jersey Shore, local businesses had a great summer in terms of\nsales, but they had a very hard time staying staffed. That’s partially because of higher salary demands,\nbut also because housing has become so expensive in those areas that workers can’t afford to live there.\nFiscal policy has added to demand. The federal government pumped around $6 trillion into American\nhouseholds during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the amount of fiscal support\nprovided by the federal government was significantly larger than the aggregate decline in GDP triggered\nby the pandemic in the first place.\nGovernment aid was dispersed in a largely untargeted fashion. For instance, mortgage forbearance and\nstudent loan forbearance were both offered to any borrowers, no questions asked, and in the case of\nstudent loans, applied automatically. Recall why these policies were enacted; we were in the middle of a\nfull-blown panic, and the federal government needed to get money out the door. But it’s clear that\npolicies like these contributed to high levels of demand. If you don’t have to pay your mortgage for a\nyear, you have a lot more money to spend on other goods and services.\nMonetary Policy\nAnd finally, expansive monetary policy — that’s us — kept the cost of capital low for long.\nThroughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and enacted a major asset-buying\nprogram. These policies stoked demand, which they were designed to do.\nAs a central bank, the Federal Reserve can do little to affect the supply constraints pushing up inflation.\nAnd as I have indicated, those problems, unfortunately, will take time to resolve.\n\n4\n\n\fBut the Federal Reserve can absolutely affect demand, and that is what we are doing. We want to see\ninflation coming down steadily and consistently, and we also want to see it abating across a wide array\nof goods and services. The goal is to adjust conditions so that demand better matches supply.\nWe have two primary tools for implementing monetary policy: the federal funds rate — usually just\nthought of as interest rates — and our balance sheet.\nSince last fall, we have been tightening financial conditions. That process, at least as the market\ninterpreted it, started last September, even before we began to move the federal funds rate or taper\nour asset purchases. Instead, simply announcing that we would soon begin to taper our asset purchases\ncaused two-year Treasury yields to rise.\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. In fact, we are now reducing our\nbalance sheet. We are shedding $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion of agency debt and mortgagebacked securities each month. Which is to say, we are removing a significant amount of financial\naccommodation quite rapidly.\nWe have also raised the federal funds rate 375 basis points since the start of the year. Granted, we\nstarted from zero, but we have raised rates significantly — and very quickly.\nIn the upcoming months, in light of the cumulative tightening we have achieved, I expect we will slow\nthe pace of our rate hikes as we approach a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I want to be clear: A rate\nhike of 50 basis points would still be significant. Since 1983, the FOMC has increased the target a total of\n88 times, and of those, 75 of the hikes were less than 50 basis points.\nAt some point next year, I expect we will hold at a restrictive rate for a while to let monetary policy do\nits work. It will take a while for the higher cost of capital to work its way through the economy.\nAfter that, if we have to, we can always tighten further, based on the data. But we should let the system\nwork itself out. And we also need to recognize that this will take time: Inflation is known to shoot up like\na rocket and then come down like a feather.\nAbove all, I want to stress that we must remain data dependent and flexible on policy. What we really\nneed to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening\nmonetary policy. And again, we need to make sure inflation expectations don’t become unanchored.\n\n5\n\n\fSo what does all of this mean for the economy? I expect that economic growth will moderate this year\nas both inflation and tightening financial conditions begin to crimp consumption. Overall, I forecast flat\nGDP growth for 2022, 1.5 percent growth in 2023, and around 2 percent growth in 2024.\nInflation will come down, but it will take some time to get to our target. I expect core PCE inflation to\ncome in around 4.8 percent in 2022, around 3.5 percent next year, and 2.5 percent in 2024.\nTurning to the job market, the unemployment rate should peak next year at 4.5 percent as financial\nconditions bite. It should then fall to 4 percent in 2024, which suggests that even as we tighten\nmonetary policy, labor markets will stay quite healthy. We’ve heard from contacts in manufacturing\nthat, given how hard they have worked to staff up, they will be extremely reluctant to cut jobs even as\nthe economy slows.\nThat gives me confidence that we can bring inflation under control without doing unnecessary damage\nto the labor market. Our resolve is strong, and our goal of stable prices and maximum employment is\nachievable.\nThanks so much for being here. I really appreciate the important work that RMA does in our region. Now\nlet’s open things up for questions.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fInflation: What Caused It and What to Do About It\nGreater Vineland Chamber of Commerce\nVineland, NJ\nOctober 20, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello! It’s great to be back in Vineland. The last time I was here three years ago, I began my talk by\nposing an extraordinarily controversial question: Is this the dandelion capital or egg capital of the\ncountry? Given the controversy this engendered, I think it’s better if I stick to safer subjects this time:\nthe country’s economic outlook, as well as my thinking on monetary policy. Then we can get to our\nQ&A, but please, nothing about dandelions or eggs.\nI also said something else three years ago: my standard Fed disclaimer. That, I do intend to repeat: The\nviews I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nInflation\nAs you all know, inflation is far too high. The Federal Reserve’s long-range target is 2 percent annualized\ninflation — and annualized inflation came in at 8.2 percent in September. Prices were up 0.4 percent in\nSeptember, from just a month before.\nThis is a period of tremendous hardship for Americans, particularly those with low or moderate income.\nWe’re seeing a huge demand at food banks — and it’s coming, in many cases, from people who are\nworking full-time. Our contacts in the banking industry are telling us that more families are taking on\nunsecured debt to meet daily expenses.\nInflation is widespread throughout the economy. While price hikes were limited initially to just a few\nitems like used cars, we’re now experiencing rapid rises in prices on everything from new vehicles and\ndishwashers to life’s staples, like food, gasoline, and rent. Health-care inflation continues to be\ntroublesome, too, and, unfortunately, shows no signs of abating. In fact, I expect hefty rises in health1\n\n\fcare premiums next year as health-care systems renegotiate reimbursements with their insurers after\nsuffering large losses this year.\nBecause of high inflation, household wealth is declining. That’s partially because purchasing power is\ndecreasing and Americans are spending their savings. It’s also because the stock market, where tens of\nmillions of Americans stash hefty portions of their retirement savings, is down on inflation fears and rate\nhikes. All of this is making it harder for Americans to save and to plan for retirement.\nMore broadly, we can’t have a well-functioning economy with high inflation, particularly if high inflation\nexpectations get embedded. To make the economy as efficient as we can in the long run, we have to get\non top of inflation.\nAnd that is precisely what the Federal Reserve is doing. Inflation is a problem that must be solved. We\nneed to see continued movement toward 2 percent core inflation. We also need to pay attention to the\ndistribution of inflation, making sure it’s falling across a wide spectrum of goods and services throughout\nthe economy.\nTo solve our inflation problem, we need to understand what has caused it. In this case, there is no\nsingular cause. It has instead been a confluence of events, essentially, a “perfect storm.”\nA global pandemic, a war in Europe, and, yes, fiscal and monetary policy decisions have combined to\nlimit supply and boost demand. The result has been inflation running at 40-year highs.\nLet’s begin with constraints on supply.\nThe events of the last few years have revealed the extraordinary fragility of global supply chains. If one\nship, stuck in one canal, could ground global logistics to a halt for days, imagine the effect of a multiyear\nglobal pandemic.\nIn fact, we don’t need to imagine it: COVID-19 lockdowns have badly damaged supply chains.\nSemiconductors, present in everything from automobiles to washing machines, have been in short\nsupply for the better part of three years as factories have shuttered for extended periods and\ninternational ports have clogged. Issues here persist, with China — “the world’s factory” — continuing\nto pursue a Zero-COVID policy. Even today, China continues to impose lockdowns, though there is some\nspeculation that these policies may now begin to be relaxed with Xi Jinping having secured a third term\nas Chinese president.\n2\n\n\fRussia’s tragic, horrific invasion of Ukraine further choked supply.\nShipments of grain and fertilizer fell, pushing up food prices. So did Russia’s energy exports. Europe and\nthe U.K. are in the middle of a full-blown energy crisis. Gasoline prices spiked here, fell a bit, and are\nnow back up again. The Saudis have further compounded our problems by announcing they will cut\nproduction, even in the face of elevated prices.\nCertain U.S. government policies have contributed to our supply-side issues. While I remain neutral on\nthe overall wisdom of each of these policies, their effect on supply is undeniable. The federal\ngovernment applies tariffs on everything from Chinese-made televisions to Canadian lumber, spiking\nprices. A more than two-year pause in legal immigration has contributed to labor shortages — we have\nabout 2 ½ million fewer workers than we would have had, had we remained on trend.\nAnd housing costs are up — though moderating slightly in recent months — not just because of pricier\nmaterials and labor, but also because we are not building enough houses to keep up with demand. This\nis often a result of local government policies, like restrictive zoning, that stymie construction.\nAll of these supply constraints have been accompanied by extraordinarily robust demand. For one, our\nlabor market remains hot. That means Americans are earning paychecks, even if their relative value is\ndeclining because of inflation. Employment in manufacturing, financial services, and other industries has\nlong since recovered from the pandemic-induced recession, and now pent-up demand within the leisure\nand hospitality industry is driving employment growth as well.\nWith some large employers like Comcast calling workers back into the office three days a week last\nmonth, I think we are starting to see a significant recovery in central business districts. Employment has\nbeen particularly down in those areas, as restaurants, bars, dry cleaners, and local shops have been\nbereft of office workers for more than two years. But I must say, Center City Philadelphia is noticeably\nmore vibrant now than it was just a couple of months ago.\nThe national unemployment rate is at a very robust 3.5 percent. In New Jersey, the unemployment rate\nis 4 percent. The national rate is actually lower than what economists generally consider to be the\nnatural unemployment rate. And indeed, there are still more job openings than there are available\nworkers.\n\n3\n\n\fNot surprisingly, this has resulted in significant upward pressure on wages. In many regions, smaller\nemployers with thin margins are having a hard time filling entry-level positions. We’ve heard from\ncommunity bankers that they can’t compete with larger banks for jobs like tellers. Near us, on the Jersey\nShore, local businesses had a great summer in terms of sales, but they had a very hard time staying\nstaffed. That’s partially because of higher salary demands but also because housing has become so\nexpensive in that area that workers can’t afford to live there.\nThe labor force participation rate is also ticking up, a particularly welcome trend. Still, prime age women\nlag prime age men in workforce participation. To tackle that, we need to begin to address the cost of\nchildcare, which has pushed far too many women out of work.\nFiscal policy has added to demand. The federal government pumped around $6 trillion into American\nhouseholds during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the amount of fiscal support\nprovided by the federal government was significantly larger than the aggregate decline in GDP triggered\nby the pandemic in the first place.\nThe government’s aid was dispersed in a largely untargeted fashion. Mortgage forbearance and student\nloan forbearance — both offered to any borrowers, no questions asked, and, in the case of student\nloans, applied automatically — and direct stimulus payments to tens of millions of households were\nboons to Americans’ bank accounts. Importantly, they were policy decisions taken during a frightening\nand uncertain time. But they have certainly contributed to the high levels of demand we are still seeing.\nMonetary Policy\nAnd finally, expansive monetary policy — that’s us — kept the cost of capital low for long.\nThroughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and enacted a major asset-buying\nprogram. These policies stoked demand, which they were designed to do.\nAs a central bank, the Federal Reserve can do little to affect the supply constraints pushing up inflation.\nAnd as I have indicated, those problems, unfortunately, will take time to resolve.\nBut the Federal Reserve can absolutely affect demand, and that is what we are doing. We want to see\ninflation coming down steadily and consistently, and we also want to see it abating across a wide array\nof goods and services. The goal is to adjust conditions so that demand better matches supply.\n4\n\n\fWe have two primary tools for implementing monetary policy: the federal funds rate — usually just\nthought of as interest rates — and our balance sheet.\nSince last fall, we have been tightening financial conditions. That process, at least as the market\ninterpreted it, started last September, even before we began to move the federal funds rate or taper\nour asset purchases. Instead, simply announcing that we would soon begin to taper our asset purchases\ncaused two-year Treasury yields to rise.\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. In fact, we are now reducing our\nbalance sheet. We are shedding $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion in agency debt and mortgagebacked securities each month. Which is to say, we are removing a significant amount of financial\naccommodation quite rapidly.\nWe have also raised the federal funds rate 300 basis points since the start of 2022. That means the Fed\nis actively trying to slow the economy. But we are going to keep raising rates for a while. Given our\nfrankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation, I expect we will be well above 4 percent by\nthe end of the year.\nSometime next year, we are going to stop hiking rates. At that point, I think we should hold at a\nrestrictive rate for a while to let monetary policy do its work. It will take a while for the higher cost of\ncapital to work its way through the economy.\nAfter that, if we have to, we can tighten further, based on the data. But we should let the system work\nitself out. And we also need to recognize that this will take time: Inflation is known to shoot up like a\nrocket and then come down like a feather.\nAbove all, I want to stress that we must remain data dependent and flexible on policy. What we really\nneed to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening\nmonetary policy.\nAnd again, we need to make sure inflation expectations don’t become unanchored. One hopeful sign is\nthat our banker contacts have been telling us that many customers are opting for adjustable-rate\nmortgages. Another lender, who issues mortgages for properties at the Jersey Shore, told us that even\nwealthier buyers are starting to balk and are waiting for rates to come down before buying a new home.\n\n5\n\n\fThat’s good news because it means borrowers expect inflation — and rates — to come down in the\nrelatively near future.\nSo, what does all this mean for the economy? I expect that economic growth will moderate this year as\nboth inflation and tightening financial conditions begin to crimp consumption. Overall, I forecast flat\nGDP growth for 2022, 1.5 percent growth in 2023, and around 2 percent growth in 2024.\nInflation will come down, but it will take some time to get to our target. I expect PCE inflation to come in\nat around 6 percent in 2022, around 4 percent next year, and 2.5 percent in 2024.\nTurning to the job market, the unemployment rate should peak next year at 4.5 percent as financial\nconditions bite. It should then fall to 4 percent in 2024, which suggests that even as we tighten\nmonetary policy, labor markets will stay quite healthy.\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of relative economic strength. Our goal\nof stable prices and maximum employment is achievable, and our resolve is strong.\nThank you very much for having me. Let’s get to your questions.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fIntroducing the Anchor Economy Initiative:\n“Eds and Meds” and Their Economic Impact\nYoung, Smart & Local Conference\nThe University of North Carolina at Greensboro\nGreensboro, North Carolina (in person and virtual)\nOctober 11, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello, everyone! It’s great to be here with so many impressive leaders from higher education, business,\nand civic organizations. This is a fantastic program, and I’m sure you all are making valuable connections.\nIt’s also great to be here in Greensboro. Although I have to say, if I eat any more Carolina barbecue on\nthis trip, they’re going to have to take me out on a stretcher …\nI’m here today to talk about the vital role that higher education institutions and hospitals — sometimes\ncalled eds and meds — play in their communities and local economies. As a Fed president, and before\nthat the leader of a large public university and dean of a business school, I saw firsthand the sizable\nimpact these institutions have.\nAnd speaking of being a Fed president, before I go any further, I need to give you my standard Fed\ndisclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nAnchor Institutions and Their Impact\nNow, I would say it’s no coincidence that we are meeting today on a university campus. Even though\nthey’ve made sizable leaps in their use of technology in recent years — especially during the COVID-19\npandemic — higher education institutions and hospitals are physically embedded in their communities.\nIn fact, that’s one of the reasons we call them anchor institutions. In multiple ways, eds and meds are\ntied to a specific place. Unlike corporate headquarters, manufacturing facilities, or sports teams that can\npick up and move — apologies to anybody from Oakland joining us today — higher education\n\n1\n\n\finstitutions and hospitals stay where they are. You quite literally can’t take the Greensboro out of UNC‒\nGreensboro.\nThere are also specific attributes that anchor these institutions in their communities. For one, higher\neducation institutions and hospitals tend to be labor intensive, meaning they are often among the\nlargest employers in their regions. In fact, health care is the largest single employment category in the\nUnited States, with more than 16 million people working in the field.\nEds and meds also serve as bulwarks against the ups and downs of the business cycle. Enrollment in\ncolleges and universities, for instance, is countercyclical, meaning that when the economy slows, more\npeople go to school, boosting anchor institutions. Hospitals are also recession resistant. After all, people\nrequire medical care no matter how the local economy is faring. All of this suggests that regions with\nstrong anchor institutions may have more durable economies than those without.\nAnd in recent years, we’ve also seen anchor institutions take an increasing interest in building up the\nareas they serve. They are typically critical partners in community development initiatives as part of\ntheir missions. We’ve seen more hospitals and universities invest in neighborhood economic\ndevelopment, boosting local commercial corridors, seeding residential real estate development, and\nbuilding neighborhood amenities, like parks. I don’t know how many of you get to Philadelphia, but the\nnext time you do, make sure to check out University City, near the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel\nUniversity. That neighborhood is now quite literally unrecognizable from what it was like when I was an\nundergrad, which, to be fair, was back in the Stone Age.\nThe impact of anchor institutions goes beyond the immediate. This is a key point that I really want to\nstress. Fundamentally, anchor institutions stimulate growth through innovation, commercialization, new\nventure formation, and talent attraction. In that sense, they can drive long-term economic development\nand growth.\nI see this in Philadelphia all the time. The talent and research coming out of our universities and healthcare systems has led to the creation of a booming biotechnology industry. Our real estate developers\ncan’t put up wet lab space fast enough, and our labs are hiring new grads straight out of school. Which is\nto say, anchor institutions are not only often the largest employers themselves in regions, they’re also\nthe producers of talent that other businesses need.\n\n2\n\n\fRisks\nWhen I give speeches on the country’s economic outlook, I often speak about downside risks. So I would\nbe remiss if I did not mention that there are risks to regions with economies that rely heavily on anchor\ninstitutions because there are risks to these institutions themselves.\nEds and meds are both being radically disrupted by technology, demographic shifts, and increasing\ncosts. As I alluded to earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated both telehealth and remote learning.\nThis has certainly created opportunities for health systems and universities to expand their markets, but\nit also loosened the place-based nature of their services. All of a sudden, these anchors are, frankly, a\nlittle less anchored. One stark example of this is Arizona State University, where half of enrolled\nundergraduates now attend class online. The economic consequences of this for regions are obvious: If\nstudents and patients don’t have to reside near or travel to anchor institutions for education or health\ncare, students’ and patients’ dollars won’t travel either.\nDemographics are another downside risk, though with disparate impacts for universities and hospitals.\nWith falling birth rates, fewer 18-year-olds are heading to college — and even fewer will enroll in the\nfuture, especially if immigrant rates remain depressed, as they are now. This demographic shift is most\napparent in the Northeast and Midwest, which also happen to have higher concentrations of colleges\nand universities. That raises real questions about the viability of many of these institutions in the future\n— and the impact on communities.\nOn the other hand, an aging population will require more health care, boosting hospitals. Even here,\nhowever, the picture is mixed, as many hospitals have closed, or soon will, in rural regions with declining\npopulations.\nMeanwhile, the ever-rising cost of education and health care means that more people may be priced\nout of accessing eds and meds altogether, which is both a humanitarian concern and an economic one.\nIntroducing the Anchor Economy Dashboard\nAt this point, I think it’s obvious why the Fed is interested in anchor institutions: They are often the\nlargest employers in regions, they’re the producers of talent that other businesses need, and they lay\nthe foundation for durable economic growth. That’s why, at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve developed what\nwe call the Anchor Economy Dashboard, a new tool that quantifies the impact that higher education\ninstitutions and hospitals have on more than 500 regions across the country.\n3\n\n\fFor each of these regions, the dashboard calculates the total number of jobs — direct, indirect, or\ninduced — supported by local eds and meds institutions. Direct jobs comprise those employed directly\nby anchor institutions, such as doctors, nurses, and college professors. Indirect jobs are those in fields\nthat directly support anchor institutions, like IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced jobs are\nthose that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate. The folks working at\nthose restaurants near campus on Tate Street have induced jobs.\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance\nindex for each region. The reliance index provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional\neconomy is on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and\nincorporates measures of impact in employment, income, and gross value added. A reliance index of 1\nmeans a region’s reliance on anchor institutions is at the national average — below that means it’s less\nreliant, and above that means it’s more reliant.\nOn a national scale, the dashboard clearly shows what I’ve been talking about: The economic impact of\nanchor institutions is massive, with 9 percent of total U.S. employment, 6.3 percent of total U.S. income,\nand 8.1 percent of total U.S. gross value added from higher education institutions and hospitals. That\ntranslates to about 18 million jobs, $1.1 trillion in income, and $1.7 trillion in goods and services in gross\nvalue added to the economy.\nAnd now, let’s do something cool and look at the data for a few of the 524 metro areas in the\ndashboard.\nLet’s begin with where we are — Greensboro.\nAs we can see, in the Greensboro‒High Point area, around 41,000 jobs, $2.3 billion in income, and $3.3\nbillion in gross value added are produced by eds and meds. That equates to about 8.4 percent of the\nregion’s employment, 6.6 percent of its income, and 7.8 percent of its gross value added. All of this\namounts to a reliance index of 0.98 percent — almost exactly average for the country.\nNow, as you’ll see, an amazing feature of the dashboard is that it allows you to compare regions head to\nhead. So let’s take a look at how Greensboro stacks up with two of its competitor regions: Greenville,\nSouth Carolina, and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Thank you for not booing at their mention.\n\n4\n\n\fAs you can see, Greenville has slightly higher figures for employment, income, and gross value added\nthan Greensboro. But its reliance index is basically on par with Greensboro, at exactly average.\nChattanooga has significantly lower total figures and a lower reliance index.\nNext, let’s take a look at the Durham‒Chapel Hill area, just down I-40 from here. As we can see, those\nare some big numbers. More than 100,000 jobs, $7 billion in income, and more than $10 billion in gross\nvalue added comes from local anchor institutions. That amounts to nearly a quarter of the area’s jobs\nand more than a fifth of its income and gross value added. And the area’s reliance index is truly\neyepopping at 2.86, nearly three times the national average.\nLast, because I’m a bit biased, let’s take a peek at Philadelphia.\nAs you can see, the gross totals are large, owing to the region’s huge population. But the reliance index\nis above average, too, indicating that the Philadelphia area is more reliant than most of the country on\neds and meds.\nOK, honestly, I could use this tool all day. And I suspect many of you could as well — so please go to\nphiladelphiafed.org to delve into the dashboard.\nConclusion\nI’m really proud of our dashboard and excited for all the work to come. I’d also like to commend\nDeborah Diamond, director of the Anchor Economy Initiative, for her stellar work. These data really\nserve as a foundation for forthcoming research and discussion that will advance crucial conversations\nabout challenges and opportunities of anchor-based economies. In fact, we are going to have one of\nthose conversations now.\nSo, thanks again for having me. It’s an honor and a delight to be here with all of you.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fFintech in a Changing World\nThe Sixth Annual Fintech Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual/in-person hybrid)\nAugust 3, 2022\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! I’d like to begin by giving a big welcome to everyone here in Philadelphia and to\nthose of you joining us virtually. One of the benefits of hosting a hybrid conference like this is\nthat we derive the advantages of being together physically — I’ve had some of my best ideas on\nthe sidelines of conferences like these — while also being able to welcome many people who\ncouldn’t make it to Philadelphia.\nIt’s great that we have such a huge turnout today. I think that’s a testament not only to the\ngrowing interest in the subject we are here to discuss — fintech — but also to the stellar lineup\nthat we’ve assembled for this, the Philadelphia Fed’s Sixth Annual Fintech Conference. My\ncolleague Julapa Jagtiani, the organizer of these proceedings, has truly done it again. If you’ve\nnever been to one of our fintech conferences before, trust me, you’re in for a treat. Over the\nnext two days, we will hear from the leading voices in industry, government, and the Fed.\nAnd speaking of the Fed, here is where I give my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express\ntoday are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOur last fintech conference was in November 2021, and although that wasn’t even a year ago, I\nthink it’s safe to say that conditions for the fintech industry — not to speak of the broader\neconomy — have changed dramatically.\n\n1\n\n\fI’ll give one example. Last November, I spoke about the rapid growth of buy now, pay later\nfirms, which effectively repurposed Kmart’s old layaway model for the digital age. With buy\nnow, pay later, shoppers are able to divide payments for purchases into a series of installments\n— sometimes with zero interest tacked on. And unlike with layaway, consumers benefit from\ngetting the product up front and paying for it over time. This has proved a popular option, with\nbuy now, pay later representing $2 of every $100 spent on e-commerce in 2021.\nBuy now, pay later looked robust in a low-interest rate environment. That’s because the vast\nmajority of firms in the space have no deposits to tap. Instead, they borrow money that they\nthen turn around and lend. Typically, their revenue comes from fees charged to merchants.\nRising rates have drastically changed the landscape for buy now, pay later. Forced to borrow at\nhigher rates, these firms are facing pressures they simply weren’t last November.\nUnsurprisingly, major operators in the space have retrenched, with one of the leading lenders\nshedding 10 percent of its workforce last month.\nThe fintech landscape is changing rapidly as a result of macroeconomic conditions. Significant\ndevelopments are occurring, and we’re lucky to have so many superb panelists here this week\nto discuss them.\nThe adoption of buy now, pay later has important implications for offering financial services to\nlow- and moderate-income consumers or others who may be locked out of more traditional\nmeans of obtaining credit. Consider a young adult in her first job who has no established credit\nhistory and therefore can’t get approved for a bank credit card. She can now use buy now, pay\nlater to finance that important purchase. Moreover, some buy now, pay later lenders report\npayment histories to credit bureaus, allowing these new borrowers to begin to build a credit\nhistory.\nOr think about the family that declared bankruptcy several years ago and that continues to be\ncharged high rates on traditional forms of lending, even though they’re back on their financial\nfeet. Buy now, pay later offers an alternate method of accessing credit.\n\n2\n\n\fA survey from the Philadelphia Fed of buy now, pay later users in the United States found that\nusers are generally non-White, lower earning, and younger than users of other payment\nmethods like debit and credit cards.\nFintech, in other words, can help foster financial inclusion. That’s undeniable. But that is far\nfrom inevitable.\nLike all tools, fintech can be used for good, ill, or somewhere in between. Just as fintech can\nfoster frictionless legitimate transactions, for instance, it can foster frictionless fraudulent\ntransactions as well. Fraud is an example of where a little bit of friction can be a good thing.\nFintech has developed a lot over the six years we’ve been hosting these conferences, and the\ndiscussions like those we will have over the next two days have moved out of the largely\ntheoretical and evermore into the realm of the empirical. We have increasingly rich data sets\nhere in the United States and abroad that provide important insights on how fintech is\nreshaping credit markets.\nTake one example: A recent paper examined how fintech lending differed from traditional bank\nlending in China during the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Analyzing the dispersal of\nunsecured personal loans by three large fintech firms and a large commercial bank, the\nresearchers found that fintechs were more likely than banks to extend credit to new and\nfinancially constrained borrowers. Fintech borrowers were more likely to be unemployed, to\nearn lower incomes, and to have had prior delinquencies.\nA happy story, right? Well, not quite.\nThat’s because it turns out that the delinquency rate of fintech loans tripled after the COVID-19\noutbreak, whereas there was no significant change in the delinquency rate for bank loans over\nthe same period. This is a puzzling finding, somehow suggesting that, in this case at least,\nfintech lenders were unable to accurately predict borrowers’ financial health in the event of a\npandemic, but commercial banks were. That strongly implies that the Chinese fintech firms\nwere operating with imperfect or insufficient information about their borrowers. While issuing\n\n3\n\n\fcredit to the financially constrained is potentially beneficial, it does no good to the lenders or\nthe borrowers if the loans end up delinquent.\nBut this is hardly an iron law: Other examples have found fintech loans going delinquent at\nlower rates than bank loans. That suggests that elevated or lower credit risk is not necessarily\ninherent to fintech itself, but rather dependent on each firm’s particular business model.\nAnother recent paper that examines unsecured small business loans in India offers an\nimportant example. There, the authors found, when fintechs used a more holistic method for\nevaluating borrowers’ credit risk than a simple credit score, both borrowers and lenders\nbenefited.\nOver several years, small businesses in India seeking credit from fintechs agreed to share data\non their so-called cashless payments, certified checks, Internet banking, mobile banking, pointof-sale transactions, and money transfers on mobile apps. The upshot? They gained access to\nlarger loans at lower rates than those who used traditional credit scores to access credit.\nOne can imagine such a model working here in the U.S., where the credit constrained are able\nto demonstrate their creditworthiness in ways besides their credit scores. In my opinion, there\nis no good reason that on-time rent and utility payments should not be just as determinative in\nobtaining credit as on-time payments for car loans or credit cards.\nAgain, the opportunities to use fintech to reach the economically constrained and financially\nmarginalized are truly exciting — and very important. It’s now on all of us to seize them.\nSo again, thank you so much for joining us. We have a very rich menu of programming over the\nnext two days, which I’m sure we will all benefit from.\nI’ll now turn things over to David Mills, my colleague from the Board of Governors, who will\nlead a discussion on the future of payments.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nEconomic Outlook: The More Things Change\nMid-Size Bank Coalition of America\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nMay 18, 2022\n\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello, everyone! It’s great to be back with this group that I last addressed about a year and a half ago. A\nlot has changed since we were last together, I will say! I’m looking forward to talking a little bit about\nthe economic outlook, inflation, and monetary policy, and some recent Philadelphia Fed research on the\njob market. Then I will be glad to field some of your questions.\nOne thing that has not changed since last we met is the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express\ntoday are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhile I was preparing for this meeting, I took a look at my notes from our last discussion. When I say\nthings have changed a lot since January 2021, I think you’ll see what I mean.\nThen, 2 percent of the U.S. population was fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Today, 67 percent are,\nand highly effective new treatments for the disease have been developed as well.\nThen, the national unemployment rate was 6.4 percent. Today, it is 3.6 percent, and there are 11.5\nmillion unfilled jobs.\nThen, we had just concluded a year in which inflation came in at 1.2 percent, well below the Fed’s target\nof 2 percent. Today, we are dealing with annualized inflation of 8.3 percent.\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nInflation\nHigh inflation is a scourge, punishing low- and moderate-income families the most. Even though wages\nare rising, they are not keeping up with the pace of gains in the cost of living. This is an urgent problem.\nInflation is a result of two factors: supply and demand.\nOn the supply side, COVID-19 lockdowns — still ongoing in parts of China as we speak — have badly\ndamaged supply chains. Semiconductors, present in everything from automobiles to washing machines,\nare hard to come by as factories have shuttered for extended periods and international ports have\nclogged. The unavoidable result of shortages? Higher prices.\nGovernment policies — and I evince no position on whether these are wise on balance — have\nundeniably contributed to price gains. The U.S. government slaps tariffs on everything from Chinesemade televisions to Canadian lumber, spiking prices. Sanctions imposed on Russia after its tragic and\noutrageous invasion of Ukraine have reduced energy and commodity supplies. Unfortunately, I think\nelevated energy prices could be with us for a while. A two year “pause” in legal immigration has\ncontributed to labor shortages. And housing costs are up, not just because of pricier materials and labor,\nbut also because we are not building enough houses to keep up with demand. This is often a result of\nlocal government policies that stymie construction.\nOn the demand side, Americans have money to spend. Nominal wages are rising, thanks to our tight\nlabor market. Fiscal policy pumped trillions of dollars into households during the worst periods of the\npandemic. And accommodative monetary policy — that’s us — has kept the cost of capital low.\nThroughout the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and embarked on a\nmajor asset-buying program.\nIt should go without saying that, as a central bank, there is little the Federal Reserve can do to affect the\nsupply constraints pushing up inflation. But we can affect demand — and that is what we have begun to\ndo.\nThe tightening, at least as the market interpreted it, began last September, even before we began to\nmove the federal funds rate or taper our asset purchases. My colleague Fed Governor Chris Waller\npointed out in a recent speech that, after the FOMC’s September 2021 statement, which indicated as\nforward guidance that we would soon begin tapering our asset purchases, two-year Treasury yields\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nbegan to rise. Again, this was before we had actually taken any action; it was simply a result of our\nforward guidance.\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. We have also raised the federal funds\nrate 75 basis points since the start of the new year. Beginning on June 1, we will start to reduce our\nbalance sheet.\nGoing forward, if there are no significant changes in the data in the coming weeks, I expect two\nadditional 50 basis point rate hikes in June and July. After that, I anticipate a sequence of increases in\nthe funds rate at a measured pace until we are confident that inflation is moving toward the\nCommittee’s inflation target. This will be dependent on where the data are. Because I can tell you this:\nOne thing that has not changed since last January is the generally elevated level of uncertainty about\nour current economic path. Reality has a way of interceding — and at no time has that been more\napparent than over the past two years.\nOverall, despite a contraction in the first quarter, I expect growth of about 3 percent this year.\nUnderlying demand growth remains strong, and the job market should stay tight through 2022.\nThe Job Market for Non-College Workers\nNow I’d like to turn to the labor market and share some recent research from the Philadelphia Fed.\nI’d like to begin by asking you to think back to what things were like before the pandemic. I know this\ncan be a challenge — it certainly is for me.\nIn general, the economy was quite healthy before COVID-19 struck, with solid GDP growth and low\nunemployment. But those headline numbers masked serious problems, most notably in the labor\nmarket. Many prime age workers, particularly men, and especially men without college degrees, had\ndropped out of the labor force altogether — so they didn’t show up in the unemployment data. Many\nmore Americans were essentially “stuck” — they may have been working, but they had jobs with\nstagnant wages and minimal opportunities for advancement.\nA big focus of ours at the Philadelphia Fed has been working to get more of these workers into what we\ncall opportunity occupations — jobs that don’t require a college degree and that pay above the median\nwage. We even developed an interactive tool called the Occupational Mobility Explorer, which\ndemonstrates that many workers in lower-wage employment already possess the skills they need to\ntransition to a higher-paying job with just a little bit of training. You simply input your job and your\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nmetro area into the tool, and the Explorer suggests available career paths. A bill collector, for instance,\ncould become a credit counselor and enjoy a significant bump in wages. I urge you to delve into the\nOccupational Mobility Explorer at Philadelphiafed.org.\nIn recent months, my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed set out to answer another important question:\nHow did the pandemic affect workers without college degrees?\nInitially, of course, it was those workers who suffered the worst effects of the pandemic-induced\nrecession. Workers without college degrees were less likely to be able to work from home and were\nmore likely to work in industries that were shut down either by government order or because of COVID19 outbreaks. The huge spike in unemployment we experienced in 2020 — at its peak, the\nunemployment nearly quadrupled — was disproportionately concentrated among those without college\ndegrees and those in lower-wage work.\nBut what happened to those workers when the economy reopened?\nBy June 2021, job openings were at record highs as a variety of factors kept workers on the sidelines,\neven as consumer demand surged. Employers deployed all kinds of methods to lure workers. They, for\ninstance, offered increased flexibility and training and bumped up starting salaries. These were\nfavorable trends for workers.\nExamining a data set of job postings, Philadelphia Fed researchers identified another trend favorable to\nworkers without a college degree, in particular: The minimum level of education required in the online\njob market fell modestly, even after controlling for the postings’ broad occupation and sector\nclassifications. In other words, some job postings that before the pandemic might have required a\ncollege degree no longer did.\nAll told, compared with the five quarters preceding the pandemic, the five quarters following its onset\nincluded an additional 2.3 million “opportunity employment” job postings. You’ll recall that these are\njobs that don’t require a four-year college degree and that pay at least the median wage. These\nadditional postings can be attributed to both the greater volume of job postings for these types of jobs\nat 62 percent and the lower educational requirements, at 38 percent of the increase. Which is to say, a\nlot of job openings that might have been previously off-limits to someone without a college degree\nbecame viable options after the start of the pandemic.\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nThis is clearly a salutary trend, and we should all be thinking of ways to build on it. Uncertainty, if\nnothing else, can breed opportunities to build a better economy that works for all Americans.\nSo, thanks again for having me back. And now let’s get to some questions.\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s really great to be back at the University of Delaware for this terrific event. It was\nwonderful to see so many old friends and to make some new ones at dinner last night. And also, thank\nyou for the lavish breakfast spread this morning. Although since so many of you are health-care workers,\nI have to admit I was a little self-conscious when I was filling my plate; I hid my two — OK, three — slices\nof bacon under my fruit, hoping you all wouldn’t notice.\nBut seriously, thanks so much for having me back in Delaware. It’s always a treat to be on campus\nbecause it allows to me to slip back into professor mode. And that’s what I intend to do this morning,\nthough if I recall correctly, the 9:00 a.m. slot was always a little challenging to navigate as a professor.\nBut I’ll do my best to keep you all awake — and if not, well, the coffee station is over there.\nI’m going to spend the next few minutes discussing health care as an economic driver. Then, I’ll be\nhappy to take some questions. But before I do, I need to give you what we call the standard Fed\ndisclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Changing Economy\nI had a chance to walk around the STAR campus yesterday and — quite frankly — was amazed at what I\nsaw. Like some of you, I remember when there used to be a Chrysler factory here. I also remember —\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\npainfully — when after the 2008 financial crisis, there was a shuttered Chrysler factory here. That was a\nterrible time.\nI was president of UD when the Chrysler plant closed, and I was intimately involved in the university’s\ndecision to purchase the land. But I have to say, what I saw yesterday surpassed even my own optimistic\nexpectations for what would happen to the ground I am standing on. This is now a thriving, mixed-use\ncommunity where academia, industry, and government are collaborating to perform pathbreaking\nresearch focused on clean energy, biotechnology, and, of course, health sciences, among other fields.\nInstead of Durangos, this area now produces innovations in health care. The “phoenix rising from the\nashes” may be an overused metaphor in our culture, but I think it describes best what has happened\nhere.\nIn a way, I would argue, the STAR campus serves as a metaphor for transitions occurring across our\nentire country. Traditional manufacturing remains an important component of our economy, but its\nrelative share of employment is declining. This is an extraordinarily painful transition for millions of our\nfellow Americans and for communities across the country. More must be done to support workers, their\nfamilies, and their communities as the economy changes.\nAnd change it most certainly has, with the growth of the health-care economy leading the way. In 1960,\ntotal national expenditure on health care represented about 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).\nBy 1990, that figure was up to 12 percent. Today, about a fifth of our GDP is composed of health-care\nspending. Health-care outlays are also the federal government’s number one category of spending.\nThe growth of the health-care sector is evident in employment data as well. In 1990, about 8 million\nAmericans worked in health care; that figure has since doubled to 16 million. That’s the largest single\nemployment segment in our economy.\nIn other words, the tragic experience of the last two years demonstrated not only how important the\nhealth-care sector is to our national fabric, it is extraordinarily important to our economy as well.\nA number of factors account for health care’s growing share of national spending. Some are salutary.\nMore Americans have health insurance and thus are able to access — and spend on — care. Life-saving\ntechnologies and therapies have been developed. And the country’s population is aging, a reflection, in\npart, of longer life spans. As people get older, they tend to spend more on health care. That is something\nI can personally attest to, as I’ve had a number of foot surgeries over the past couple of years as a result\nof football injuries I suffered decades ago. Moreover, if other products become cheaper, then the\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nnational share of health-care spending will, naturally, rise. That is to say, as agriculture became more\nproductive, the relative percent of spending on health care has risen.\nBut other cost drivers are less desirable. The extremely tight supply of physicians in the United States\nkeeps costs high, for instance. As a Fed president, I stay studiously neutral on political matters, and as a\nformer UD president, I remain neutral on the fact that Delaware is one of only four states without a\nmedical school. But it is a fact that Delaware has relatively few doctors to serve its population, and it is\nan iron law of economics that when supply is constrained, prices rise. Delaware has a relatively old\npopulation, too, which drives demand for health-care services.\nAnchor Institutions\nWith all this said, there can be no doubt that what we call eds and meds — colleges, universities, and\nnonprofit medical institutions — drive economic activity. These institutions are often referred to as\nanchor institutions because of the multiple ways they are tied to a place. Unlike corporate headquarters,\nmanufacturing facilities, or sports franchises that can pick up and move — sorry Raiders fans — highereducation institutions and hospitals may sometimes close, but they aren’t going anywhere. As we have\nseen, health care is labor intensive, making medical institutions some of the largest employers in their\nregions. And they are generally recession resistant. This part is crucial, too: The research and\ndevelopment functions of higher-education institutions and medical institutions generate new\nbusinesses through innovation, technology transfer, and commercialization. In fact, we are seeing that\nall over the Philadelphia region right now.\nOK, now I’m going to break a little bit of news.\nIn the coming months, the Philadelphia Fed is going to launch what we are calling the Anchor Economy\nDashboard. I’m really excited about this. The Anchor Economy Dashboard will be a new, first-ever,\nnational data set that captures the importance of anchor institutions to their regional economies. For\nthe purposes of the dashboard, anchor institutions include higher-education institutions and hospitals.\nWhile the dashboard is not live yet, we have the data underlying it, and I’d like to share some with you\ntoday.\nThe State of Delaware has 38 anchor institutions, encompassing both eds and meds. Employment\nimpacts from Delaware eds and meds total 65,316 jobs. That’s the total number of jobs — direct,\nindirect, and induced — supported by higher education and hospitals in the state.\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nDirect jobs comprise those employed directly by anchor institutions; indirect are those working in fields\nthat directly support anchor institutions, for example, IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced\njobs are those that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate. The folks\nworking over at Klondike Kate’s have jobs that are induced by UD.\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance score\nfor each region. The reliance score provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional economy\nis on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and\nincorporates measures of impact in terms of employment, income, and gross value added.\nFor Delaware, our data support what I suspect a lot of us know intuitively: This state is quite reliant on\nanchor institutions. So, while Delaware’s total employment in eds and meds ranks 46th out of 50 states\nand the District of Columbia, that is largely a result of the state having a small population. Delaware’s\nreliance score, we calculate, is 1.23. In other words, Delaware overindexes on eds and meds\nemployment, income and gross value added, compared with other regions. Delaware is 23 percent more\ndependent on eds and meds for jobs, income, and gross value added than the United States as a whole.\nBy comparison, Pennsylvania is ranked 15th in reliance at 1.19 and 863,974 total jobs attributable to eds\nand meds. New Jersey is ranked 25th in reliance at 1.05 and 569,467 total jobs attributable to eds and\nmeds. In other words, New Jersey is almost perfectly average, which pains me as a South Jersey boy to\nadmit. Montana has the highest reliance score at 1.53, with total employment impact from eds and\nmeds at 87,128 anchor institution jobs.\nAnd while I, again, remain neutral on the fact that the State of Delaware does not have a medical school,\nthe data clearly demonstrate how economically impactful having one can be for a region. Take Hershey,\nPennsylvania, which has hosted Penn State’s medical school since 1967. The Harrisburg metropolitan\nstatistical area (MSA), which encompasses Hershey, has a total population of 587,291, about half the\nsize of the State of Delaware. But the total employment impact of eds and meds for the Harrisburg MSA\nis 48,338 — 74 percent of the employment impact in Delaware. Not surprisingly, Harrisburg’s reliance\nscore is 1.45, indicating that the region overindexes on eds and meds jobs, income, and gross value\nadded compared with the rest of the country.\nThe Anchor Economy Dashboard will be launching on our website — philadelphiafed.org — in the\ncoming months, and if you’re anything like me, you’ll look forward to spending many hours delving into\nthe data.\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nThere is a lot to think about: Regions rich with anchor institutions have benefited from the way these\ninstitutions fortify the economy and support community development. But economic dependence on\nanchor institutions may increasingly come with risks as technology disrupts health care. The pandemic,\nfor instance, accelerated telehealth, creating opportunities for health-care institutions but also\nloosening the “anchor” that hospitals have traditionally represented. There’s a lot to ponder today —\nand in the weeks, months, and years ahead.\nSo, again, thanks so much for having me. Refill that coffee! And now I’m happy to take some questions.\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nThe Economy and the Job Market: Where We’re Going, Where We’ve Been\nRider University\nLawrence Township, NJ\nApril 14, 2022\n\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood evening! It’s really great to be here, a mere two years after we had initially planned to do this. The\npandemic kept us apart for far too long, and I’m thrilled that we are finally together. So, thanks so much\nfor having me.\nThe theme of this talk is “Where We’re Going, Where We’ve Been” — so I’m going to begin way, way\nback at the beginning. I want to talk a little about what the Fed is and what it does. I also want to discuss\nwhat the Fed doesn’t do, because I have to admit our powers are overestimated sometimes. I’ll then\ndiscuss the current economic situation and a little bit about the job market. Then we can move to a\nQ&A, which I’m really looking forward to.\nBut before I can do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s start with where we’ve been.\nFederal Reserve History and Structure\nThe First Bank of the United States was the brainchild of the man who in recent years has become\neverybody’s favorite founding father: Alexander Hamilton. The bank was located in Philadelphia when it\nwas still the capital of the country. It was established in 1791 to deal with the debt from the\nRevolutionary War and to ensure the government’s financial stability. It looked a lot different than the\nentity we are today, and it wasn’t without controversy.\n\n1\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nAs Broadway has reminded us, Thomas Jefferson was among those who worried about power that was\ntoo strong and too centralized. He even once famously said he found banks to be more dangerous than\nstanding armies. When the bank’s charter was up for renewal after its initial 20 years, the Jeffersonian\nargument won out and the measure failed by a vote each in the House and the Senate. The bank was\ndissolved.\nFive years later, Congress agreed to a central banking function a second time, and we launched the\nimaginatively named Second Bank of the United States. And 20 years after that, Congress decided not to\nrenew the charter, again owing to a strain of popular sentiment that didn’t trust powerful, centralized\ninstitutions.\nBut not having a central bank didn’t really work because it tended to breed volatility.\nThe period leading up to the third iteration of American central banking — the Federal Reserve — was\nmarked by currency instability, bank runs, and cycles of boom and bust. At one point, J.P. Morgan\nactually had to step in personally to bail out the country. If you’ve ever been to the Morgan Library &\nMuseum in New York, you can stand in the room where the solution to that financial crisis was worked\nout.\nEven during the Revolutionary War era, central banking was standard in democracies, and it remains\nthat way today. There are no developed economies that don’t have it in some form. So, the eventual\nadoption of our current central bank — in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act — was to some extent\ninevitable. And the configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a decentralized\nstructure — is something of a testament to old-fashioned American compromise. It also reflects the\nunique demands of the United States and our economy.\nThe Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, and 12 regional\nBanks located around the country, including the one I oversee in Philadelphia.\nThe Board seats seven governors, including the Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and\nboard of directors, which is made up of business, banking, and community leaders from the area.\nFundamentally, this provides the Fed with a perspective, within each District, of the sectors and issues\nthat make the region tick. You and I are in the Third District, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania,\nSouth Jersey, and the state of Delaware. We’re the smallest District, geographically, but I like to think we\npunch above our weight.\n\n2\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nThe Fed’s decentralized nature is, in my view, a unique strength. We’re making national policy, but\nwe’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data can obscure realities on the\nground. Conditions look very different in Philadelphia, Dover, or Lawrence Township than they do in\nDallas, Salt Lake City, or Honolulu. This system gives, in my view, a voice to a range of localities and\nsectors. It also allows us to focus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because we’re such\na big country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China and India have larger\npopulations, and no one country has a bigger economy, at least for now. And that economy is vast,\nspreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that most other nations don’t.\nSo, it makes sense that we have a system that feeds back information from around the country.\nThe other difference from most central banks is that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a single\ngoal; that is, we’re charged with both maximum employment and price stability. Most just focus on one.\nMaximum employment encompasses a wide range of metrics, although most attention is paid to the\nunemployment rate. That number, of course, will never be zero. Instead, we try to ensure that labor\nmarkets are functioning dynamically and efficiently. Price stability, on the other hand, is low and stable\ninflation, which we judge to be around 2 percent a year. More on both of these topics in a bit.\nThe decisions we make within the Fed — the way we look at the economy and respond to data — are\nbuilt entirely on the foundation of our dual mandate. It is our North Star.\nNow that we’ve established that, I turn to the question so many people secretly want to ask: What,\nexactly, does the Fed do? I’m delighted to talk about it, but just as important, I’ll also mention what we\ndon’t do.\nWe have lending power. What that means is we do not have spending power. We have no authority\nover fiscal policy, which deals with debts, deficits, and taxes. Or investments to encourage growth. Or\ngrants to worthy organizations. Or programs to spur job creation. Those all depend on elected officials,\nbe they on the local, state, or national level.\nSo, what do we do?\nWe set monetary policy. We also regulate banks, along with an alphabet soup of government agencies.\nWe are the lender of last resort during bona fide emergencies.\n3\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nAnd the lede that always gets buried — and I wish it weren’t so overshadowed by discussions of interest\nrates — is that we work within our Districts to help strengthen local communities’ economies. We have\na truly exceptional team in Philadelphia in our Community Affairs department, and they work with\npartners all over the Third District. They’re doing truly vital work on employment, transportation,\nhousing, and other issues. In fact, I’ll discuss some recent research from this department a little later.\nBut first, let me talk a bit about monetary policy. Monetary policy is a fairly limited field with a fairly\nconscripted set of tools.\nOur job is to create the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. More than anything, we’re\ntilling the land.\nMonetary policy is about meeting our dual mandate mostly by moving interest rates. There are other\ntools we use, but in normal times, it’s mostly about moving what is technically called the federal funds\nrate. In the media, that’s usually just called the interest rate.\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate on loans that banks make to each other overnight. That rate\ntends to influence interest rates more broadly, so the effect ripples through the economy. When we\nmove the federal funds rate, it affects the interest rate people pay on their mortgages and car loans and\nthat businesses pay to borrow to meet or expand their payrolls or buy inventory. In fact, sometimes just\nannouncing we are planning to raise the federal funds rate in the future affects these lending rates.\nWe set rates when the FOMC meets in Washington, which we do eight times a year. After two years of\nvirtual meetings, we’re finally back in person.\nRegional Bank presidents don’t always get to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting position every three\nyears, but the governors always do, as does the president of the New York Fed. New York, owing to the\npresence of Wall Street, enjoys something of a “first among equals” status within the System. And while\nthe rest of us don’t always vote, we do always represent our Districts and play a part in the discussion.\nThe FOMC discussion is never political. Because we’re appointed policymakers, we don’t respond to\nswings in public opinion or election cycles. Unlike politicians, who suffer the slings and arrows of the 24hour news machine, we operate in a rare, apolitical bubble. I truly believe that the independence of the\nFed is crucial to making the best decisions possible for the American economy, free from the pressures\nof politics.\n\n4\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nAlthough we’re independent, that doesn’t mean we’re unchecked. The Fed is what’s considered\n“independent within government.” We’re overseen by Congress, but neither Congress nor the\npresidential administration has a say in the decisions we make.\nThe State of the Economy\nThat’s not to suggest the Fed doesn’t come under intense political scrutiny at times, particularly when\neconomic conditions are troubled. So now, I’d like to talk a little bit about where we are.\nWhen thinking about the state of the U.S. economy, I think it’s worth taking a step back and looking at\nthe global situation. Sometimes when we’re immersed in granular data, it can be easy to miss the\neconomic forest for the trees.\nSo, where are we?\nWell, first and foremost, we’ve made significant progress, particularly on vaccinations, but we remain\nmired in the midst of a now two-year global pandemic that has killed at least 6 million people globally\nand more than 1 million here in the United States. The human toll is immense and tragic, and the\neconomic tribulations continue to reverberate. Tens of millions around the world were thrown out of\nwork by the pandemic, and supply chains were throttled. Even now, there are significant issues getting\nsupply chains back on line, which is contributing to high inflation that is harming American families.\nRussia, meanwhile, has invaded Ukraine, fomenting death and destruction and spurring a humanitarian\ncrisis in the heart of Europe.\nI have to say, given these extraordinarily trying and tragic circumstances, one can’t help but feel a little\nbit of awe at the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year — coinciding, at least in part, with the Omicron surge — GDP grew at\nan annualized rate of 7 percent, with a strong inventory investment and healthy demand for capital\ngoods. For the totality of 2021, U.S. GDP growth was a very healthy 5.7 percent.\nWhile delivery times remain elevated, there are some signs in the data, and in what we hear from our\ncontacts, that supply chain constraints are finally easing, at least somewhat. It really depends on what\nindustry — or more specifically, what good — you are talking about. And shocks continue — witness the\nrecent lockdowns in China.\n\n5\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nThe job market, half of the Fed’s mandate you’ll recall, is extremely robust. For 11 straight months, new\njob creation has topped 400,000. But if you think that has led to a decline in Help Wanted signs, you’re\nwrong. Even with all this job creation, vacancy rates remain elevated.\nNominal wage growth, as one would guess given these conditions, has been strong, though it has\nrecently not kept up with inflation. Labor participation rates are edging up as well, though they remain\nbelow where they were before the pandemic. I suspect that the waning of the virus — at least here in\nthe United States — as well as uncertain equity markets and even inflation may lure people back into\nthe workforce and persuade others to delay retirement. I know some people my age who were thinking\nabout retiring have recently decided to keep working. The unemployment rate, which is below 4\npercent, should continue to fall this year.\nSo, I think it’s fair to say the Fed has met half of its dual mandate. But the other side of our mandate is\nproving more troublesome.\nThe bottom line is this: Inflation is running far too high. I am acutely concerned about this. Generous\nfiscal policies, supply chain disruptions, and accommodative monetary policy have pushed inflation far\nhigher than I — and my colleagues on the FOMC — are comfortable with. I’m also worried that inflation\nexpectations could become unmoored.\nThe consumer price index (CPI) increased in March. Compared with a year ago, CPI is up 8.5 percent. The\nincrease was driven, in part, by higher energy and food prices. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food\nprices, remains very high as well, having increased 6.5 percent in March from a year earlier. Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine will add to inflation pressure, not only hiking oil and gas prices but other\ncommodities, like wheat and fertilizer, as well.\nInflation is widespread. It is showing up throughout a vast array of goods that comprise the CPI “basket.”\nBoth goods and services are experiencing inflation.\nThis is why last month we announced we were raising the federal funds rate for the first time since\n2018. We raised our target by 25 basis points, and I expect a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as\nthe year continues and the data evolve. I also anticipate that we will begin to reduce our holdings of\nTreasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities soon. While the Fed cannot do much\nto ameliorate the supply issues that are increasing inflation, we can begin to affect demand.\n\n6\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nWith the runoff of pandemic support, tightening monetary conditions, and the war in Ukraine pressuring\ncommodity prices, I think growth will moderate this year. We can probably expect to come in around 3\npercent to 3.5 percent GDP growth this year — and then falling to trend growth of 2 percent to 2.5\npercent during the next couple of years.\nInflation should begin to taper this year, too, though remain elevated, probably around 4 percent for\n2022. The following two years should bring it back to our target of 2 percent.\nThe Job Market for Non-College Workers\nNow, before we move on to our Q&A — and, by the way, I hope you’ll really grill me — I want to talk a\nlittle bit about some recent research from the Philadelphia Fed’s Community Development function.\nKeeping with our theme, I’d like, once again, to start with where we’ve been. I know it can be tough to\nremember — it sure is for me — but let’s try to think back to what economic conditions were like prior\nto the pandemic.\nIn general, the economy was actually quite healthy before COVID-19 struck, with solid GDP growth and\nlow unemployment. But those headline numbers masked serious problems, most notably in the labor\nmarket. Many prime age workers, particularly men, and especially men without college degrees, had\ndropped out of the labor force altogether — so they didn’t show up in unemployment data. Many more\nAmericans were essentially “stuck” — they may have been working, but they had jobs with stagnant\nwages and minimal opportunities for advancement.\nA big focus of our Community Development function at the Philadelphia Fed has been working to get\nmore of these workers into what we call opportunity occupations — jobs that don’t require a college\ndegree and that pay above the median wage. They even developed an interactive tool called the\nOccupational Mobility Explorer, which demonstrates that many workers in lower-wage employment\nalready possess the skills they need to transition to a higher-paying job with just a little bit of training.\nYou simply input your job and your metro area into the tool, and the Explorer suggests available career\npaths. A bill collector, for instance, could become a credit counselor and enjoy a significant bump in\nwages. I urge you to delve into the Occupational Mobility Explorer at Philadelphiafed.org.\nIn recent months, my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed set out to answer another important question:\nHow did the pandemic affect workers without college degrees?\n\n7\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nInitially, of course, it was those workers who suffered the worst effects of the pandemic-induced\nrecession. Workers without college degrees were less likely to be able to work from home and were\nmore likely to work in industries that were shut down either by government order or because of COVID19 outbreaks. The huge spike in unemployment we experienced in 2020 — at its peak, the\nunemployment nearly quadrupled — was disproportionately concentrated among those without college\ndegrees and those in lower-wage work.\nBut what happened to those workers when the economy reopened?\nBy June 2021, job openings were at record highs as a variety of factors kept workers on the sidelines\neven as consumer demand surged. Employers deployed all kinds of methods to lure workers. They, for\ninstance, offered increased flexibility and training and bumped up starting salaries. These were\nfavorable trends for workers.\nExamining a data set of job postings, Philadelphia Fed researchers identified another trend favorable to\nworkers without a college degree, in particular: The minimum level of education required in the online\njob market fell modestly, even after controlling for the postings’ broad occupation and sector\nclassifications. In other words, some job postings that before the pandemic might have required a\ncollege degree no longer did.\nAll told, compared with the five quarters preceding the pandemic, the five quarters following its onset\nincluded an additional 2.3 million “opportunity employment” job postings. You’ll recall that these are\njobs that don’t require a four-year college degree and that pay at least the median wage. These\nadditional postings can be attributed to both the greater volume of job postings for these types of jobs\nat 62 percent and also the lower educational requirements, at 38 percent of the increase. Which is to\nsay, a lot of job openings that might have been previously off-limits to someone without a college\ndegree became viable options after the start of the pandemic.\nThis is clearly a salutary trend, and we should be thinking of ways to build on it. You, as future college\ngraduates, will play a key role in building a new economy that works for everyone.\nSo, thanks again so much for having me. I hope it was worth the two-year wait. And now I’m happy to\ntake some questions.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello! It’s great to be here again for what is becoming an annual tradition. I’m very much looking\nforward to today’s conversation. I plan to discuss the economic outlook, monetary policy, and a bit of\nresearch on housing from the Philadelphia Fed. And then we can have an open discussion.\nAnd now for another tradition: the standard Fed disclaimer. The views I express today are my own and\ndo not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThe Economy\nWhen I addressed this group almost exactly a year ago, I called the economic recovery, both nationally\nand here in Delaware, a “work in progress.”\nI think that still holds. Economic growth and employment are robust, but I’m very concerned about\ninflation.\nLet’s begin on the positive side of the ledger.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year — coinciding, at least in part, with the Omicron surge — national GDP\ngrew at an annualized rate of 7 percent, with strong inventory investment and healthy demand for\ncapital goods. For the totality of 2021, U.S. GDP growth was a very healthy 5.7 percent. That this\noccurred in the midst of a deadly pandemic is quite a testament to the underlying strength of our\neconomy.\n\n1\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nJob growth, a key component of the Fed’s mandate, remains robust. For 11 straight months, new job\ncreation has topped 400,000. But if you think that has led to a decline in Help Wanted signs, you’re\nwrong. Even with all this job creation, vacancy rates remain elevated, at a near record.\nNominal wage growth — as one would guess given these conditions — has been strong, though lately it\nhas not been keeping up with inflation. Labor participation rates are edging up as well, though they\nremain below where they were before the pandemic. I suspect that the waning of the virus — at least\nhere in the United States — as well as uncertain equity markets and even inflation may lure people back\ninto the workforce and persuade others to delay retirement. The unemployment rate, which is below 4\npercent, should continue to fall this year.\nIn Delaware, the recovery continues apace.\nThe unemployment rate is nearing pre-pandemic levels, overall gains in payroll employment have been\nsteady, labor market conditions are tight, and the housing market remains hot. Consumer traffic to\nworkplaces and other nonresidential locations has increased substantially, though transit use remains\nalmost 40 percent below where it was prior to the pandemic.\nTotal employment in Delaware is now about 14,000 jobs below where it was when the pandemic struck.\nJob openings were at a historic high in January, the quits rate remains elevated, and layoffs are very low.\nEmployment in financial services is where it was prior to COVID-19’s arrival, while leisure and hospitality\nemployment remain somewhat depressed.\nA persistent problem in getting more people back into the labor force is the high cost and low\navailability of child care. The problems are acute here. To cite just one statistic, Delaware families spend\nabout 20 percent of the median household’s income to care for one child, an unsustainable burden.\nMany of you are probably aware of the work that the Philadelphia Fed and the Delaware Chamber have\nbeen doing on this important issue, and I’d be happy to discuss this further during our Q&A.\nInflation\nInflation is running far too high, and I am acutely concerned about this. The consumer price index (CPI)\nwas up 10 percent annualized in February, led by another significant increase in energy prices. Over the\npast year, CPI is up 7.9 percent.\n\n2\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nCore CPI, stripping out energy and other volatile indicators, remains very high as well, with 6.2 percent\nannualized growth in February. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will add to inflation pressure, not only hiking\noil and gas prices but other commodities, like wheat and fertilizer, as well.\nDelivery times remain elevated, and while there are some signs in the data, and in what we hear from\nour contacts, that supply chain constraints are finally easing, we are not out of the woods yet. In\nresponse to a new COVID-19 wave, China is instituting hard lockdowns in major manufacturing hubs,\nfurther choking supply.\nInflation is widespread. It is showing up throughout a vast array of goods that comprise the CPI “basket”\n— and among some of those that aren’t in the basket.\nThe bottom line is that generous fiscal policies, supply chain disruptions, and accommodative monetary\npolicy have pushed inflation far higher than I — and my colleagues on the FOMC — are comfortable\nwith. I’m also worried that inflation expectations could become unmoored.\nThat is why last month we announced we were raising the federal funds rate for the first time since\n2018. We raised our target by 25 basis points, and I expect a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as\nthe year continues and the data evolve. I also anticipate that we will begin to reduce our holdings of\nTreasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities soon.\nWith the runoff of pandemic support, tightening monetary conditions, and the war in Ukraine pressuring\ncommodity prices, I think growth will moderate this year. We can probably expect 3 percent to 3.5\npercent GDP growth this year before falling to trend growth of 2 percent to 2.5 percent during the next\ncouple of years.\nI do see the potential for a significant uptick in the service sector in many large cities that are only now\nwaking up after a two-year pandemic-induced hibernation. Central business districts in cities like New\nYork, San Francisco, and Philadelphia should get a boost as more workers return to their offices — the\nstaff of the Philadelphia Fed included. The rise of hybrid work may moderate the potential for a huge\nboom, however. There is a big question mark hanging over the future of commercial real estate.\nInflation should begin to taper this year too — but remain elevated, probably around 4 percent for 2022.\nThe following two years should bring it back to our target of 2 percent.\nAll of these forecasts, of course, are freighted with uncertainty.\n\n3\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nHousing\nNow, before we move to the open discussion, I’d like to turn to housing, which comprises a huge and\nvitally important sector of the U.S. economy. With a fairly weak public social safety net, for Americans,\nhouses are not only their shelters — they are a significant source of their household wealth and\nretirement savings as well.\nIn general, the housing market is largely healthy; if anything, it’s not keeping up with demand.\nHousing starts are robust, but inventories are low and price growth is strong. Policies that make\nconstruction arduous in certain states and municipalities continue to impede efforts to meet demand.\nThat degrades overall economic performance, because in many places, people cannot afford to live\nwhere the jobs are.\nNow I’d like to turn specifically to mortgage forbearance, a subject of important research from the staff\nof the Philadelphia Fed.\nAs many of you will recall, at the outset of the pandemic, the CARES Act mandated that borrowers of\nfederally insured mortgages be granted forbearances. To ensure widespread take-up, the law said\nborrowers could be granted forbearances by simply requesting it; they did not even need to prove\nhardship. The upshot was that homeowners could temporarily pause their mortgage payments without\npenalty and stay in their homes, without negatively affecting their credit scores.\nThe CARES Act also put into place a foreclosure moratorium, followed by temporary protections against\nforeclosure. Private sector lenders adopted the same practices.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, as the pandemic began and the economy was shut down, Americans took this\nopportunity in droves. More than 8.5 million borrowers entered forbearance at some point during the\npandemic — more than 15 percent of the total mortgage market.\nThat was then, though.\nAs of last month, the number of loans in forbearance had declined by more than 90 percent, down to\naround 680,000 mortgages.\nSo, what has become of the nearly 8 million households that entered forbearance and have since come\nout of it? Our researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been tracking this and have made some\nimportant findings.\n4\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nI’ll begin with the positive news.\nNearly three-quarters of those who have exited forbearance have voluntarily paid off or are current,\nmany making use of payment deferrals or loan modifications.\nFor borrowers able to resume timely payments, a deferral creates a no-interest subordinated lien out of\ntheir missed payments not due until loan payoff. Meanwhile, loan modifications offer lower interest\nrates and extend loan terms up to 40 years while offering payment reductions of 20 percent or more.\nMoreover, our exceptionally strong housing market has kept home prices elevated.\nWhile this has had undeniably negative impacts on those seeking to enter the housing market, it does\nensure that borrowers can avoid losing their homes and that banks won’t suffer losses large enough to\nmeaningfully affect their capital positions. Homeowners are sitting on more than $10 trillion of tappable\nequity — a record. The contrast with the Great Recession is remarkable; you’ll recall back then that\nnearly half of all distressed borrowers were “underwater.”\nStill, nearly 1 million mortgages are seriously delinquent, split evenly between those classified by\nservicers in loss mitigation and those not in loss mitigation. Most borrowers who remain seriously\ndelinquent and not in loss mitigation never entered forbearance at all. Many were in nonpayment\nbefore the pandemic struck.\nAnd of the borrowers classified as being in loss mitigation, three-quarters are still in process and have\nnot, as of yet, resumed timely payments on their mortgages. Black and Hispanic borrowers have much\nhigher shares of nonpayment — either being in forbearance or delinquency. Interestingly, just as the\nunemployment rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels, the number of delinquent mortgages has also\nreturned to pre-pandemic rates.\nLenders may want to consider solutions that limit the costs of modification while providing more\npayment relief to borrowers. One such solution is for the Federal Housing Administration to offer 40year modifications. This will lower the cost relative to the 30-year option and provide more relief to\nborrowers. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a 40-year mortgage\nmodification for FHA loans, and we are currently in the midst of a 60-day comment period.\nIt’s worth noting now that protections against foreclosure expired on December 31, 2021, and\nforeclosure starts are back to their pre-pandemic levels too.\n\n5\n\n\fPUBLIC/OFFICIAL RELEASE // EXTERNAL\n\nI would like to say a couple of words about some research on mortgage refinances as well.\nRefinance mortgage originations grew remarkably in 2020 in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania —\nin fact, they vastly outpaced the growth in mortgages for new home purchases. A lot of that we owe, of\ncourse, to the extraordinary circumstances we found ourselves in that year: Mortgage interest rates fell\nto historic lows as the economy was shuttered, keeping people where they were.\nBut my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed have found, while refinances were popular during this period,\nthe growth rate for refinanced mortgages for Black and low- and moderate-income borrowers was only\nabout half to three-quarters of the growth rate for borrowers overall.\nWhat’s instructive is that the lower rate of refinances was not solely because of higher denial rates,\nthough historically those communities have been denied at higher rates.\nRather, our Bank researchers found refinance applications from Black and low- and moderate-income\nborrowers grew at a much slower rate than applicants overall. That suggests a need for improved\ncommunication from banks to Black and low- and moderate-income households. Unfortunately, many\nhomeowners missed out on some significant savings they could have enjoyed if they had refinanced. We\nshould think of ways to make sure these communication breakdowns do not happen again.\nSo, thanks again for having me. I’m sure the next time we convene, more progress will have been made.\nNow let’s open things up for discussion.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello! It’s great to be here. And I mean it today more than ever, because this is my first in-person speech\nin more than two years. I know I’m a little out of practice, because just as I was about to begin speaking,\nI made sure my mute button wasn’t on. Old habits die hard, it seems.\nIn all seriousness, thanks so much for having me. I’m very much looking forward to today’s conversation.\nI plan to discuss the economic outlook, monetary policy, housing, and a bit about money market funds.\nAnd then we can have an open discussion.\nBut before I begin, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer. The views I express today are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic Outlook\nWhen I look at the current state of the world, I can’t help but think of the old curse about living in\n“interesting times.”\nWe’ve made significant progress, particularly on vaccinations, but remain mired in the midst of a now\ntwo-year global pandemic that has, tragically, killed at least 6 million people globally and around 1\nmillion here in the United States. That’s the equivalent of a city larger than San Francisco or Seattle\nbeing felled by this virus. Russia has invaded Ukraine, fomenting death and destruction and spurring a\n\n1\n\n\fhumanitarian crisis in the heart of Europe. And as policymakers, we at the Fed are confronting inflation\nrunning at multidecade highs, a subject I will touch on shortly.\nNow, all of that said — and given these extraordinarily trying and tragic circumstances — one can’t help\nbut feel a little bit of awe at the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year — coinciding, at least in part, with the Omicron surge — GDP grew at\nan annualized rate of 7 percent, with strong inventory investment and a healthy demand for capital\ngoods. For the totality of 2021, U.S. GDP growth was a very healthy 5.7 percent.\nWhile delivery times remain elevated, there are some signs in the data, and in what we hear from our\ncontacts, that supply chain constraints are finally easing. This should pave the way for healthy sales of\ndurable goods like automobiles and appliances.\nJob growth, a key component of the Fed’s mandate, remains robust. For 10 straight months, new job\ncreation has topped 400,000. But if you think that has led to a decline in Help Wanted signs, you’re\nwrong. Even with all this job creation, vacancy rates remain elevated.\nNominal wage growth, as one would guess given these conditions, has been strong. Labor participation\nrates are edging up as well, though they remain below where they were before the pandemic. I suspect\nthat the waning of the virus — at least here in the United States — as well as uncertain equity markets\nand even inflation may lure people back into the workforce and persuade others to delay retirement.\nThe unemployment rate, below 4 percent, should continue to fall this year.\nNow to the “10 percent” elephant in the room.\nInflation is running far too high, and I am acutely concerned about this. The consumer price index (CPI)\nwas up 10 percent annualized in February, led by another significant increase in energy prices. Over the\npast year, CPI is up 7.9 percent. Core CPI, stripping out energy and other volatile indicators, remains very\nhigh as well, with 6.2 percent annualized growth in February. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will add to\ninflation pressure, not only hiking oil and gas prices but other commodities, like wheat and fertilizer, as\nwell.\nInflation is widespread. It is showing up throughout a vast array of goods that comprise the CPI “basket”\n— and among some of those that aren’t in the basket. One of our contacts, for instance, mentioned\nwhopping membership fee increases at his golf club, suggesting this summer may be a good time to play\nat your local muni instead.\n2\n\n\fThe bottom line is that generous fiscal policies, supply chain disruptions, and accommodative monetary\npolicy have pushed inflation far higher than I — and my colleagues on the FOMC — are comfortable\nwith. I’m also worried that inflation expectations could become unmoored.\nWhich is why last week we announced we were raising the federal funds rate for the first time since\n2018. We raised our target by 25 basis points, and I expect a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as\nthe year continues and the data evolve. I also anticipate that we will begin to reduce our holdings of\nTreasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities soon.\nWith the runoff of pandemic support, tightening monetary conditions, and the war in Ukraine pressuring\ncommodity prices, I think growth will moderate this year. We can probably expect to come in around 3\npercent to 3.5 percent GDP growth this year — and then falling to trend growth of 2 percent to 2.5\npercent during the next couple of years.\nI do see a potential for a significant uptick in the service sector in large, politically “blue” cities that are\nonly now waking up after a two-year pandemic-induced hibernation. Central business districts in cities\nlike New York, San Francisco, and Philadelphia should get a boost as more workers return to their offices\n— the staff of the Philadelphia Fed included. The rise of hybrid work may moderate the potential for a\nhuge boom, however. There is a big question mark hanging over the future of commercial real estate.\nInflation should begin to taper this year too — though remain elevated, probably around 4 percent for\n2022. The following two years should bring it back to our target of 2 percent.\nAll of these forecasts are freighted with uncertainty. Recall, again, that we live in “interesting times.”\nHousing\nNow, before we move to the open discussion, I’d like to turn to housing, which comprises a huge and\nvitally important sector of the U.S. economy — and, I’ve found, is a topic of particular interest here in\nNew York. With a fairly weak social safety net, for Americans, houses are not only their shelters — they\nare a significant source of their household wealth and retirement savings as well.\nIn general, the housing market is largely healthy; if anything, it’s not keeping up with demand. Housing\nstarts are robust, but inventories are low and price growth is strong. Policies that make construction\narduous in certain states and municipalities continue to impede efforts to meet demand.\n\n3\n\n\fI’d now like to turn specifically to mortgage forbearance, a subject that the staff at the Philadelphia Fed\nhas been doing some very important research on.\nAs many of you will recall, at the outset of the pandemic, the CARES Act mandated that borrowers of\nfederally insured mortgages be granted forbearances. To ensure widespread take-up, the law said\nborrowers could be granted forbearances by simply requesting it; they did not even need to prove\nhardship. The upshot was that homeowners could temporarily pause their mortgage payments without\npenalty and stay in their homes, without dinging their credit scores.\nThe CARES Act also put into place a foreclosure moratorium, followed by temporary protections against\nforeclosure. Private sector lenders adopted the same practices.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, as the pandemic began and the economy was shut down, Americans took this\nopportunity in droves: More than 8.5 million borrowers entered forbearance at some point during the\npandemic — more than 15 percent of the total mortgage market.\nThat was then, though.\nAs of last month, the number of loans in forbearance had declined by more than 90 percent, down to\naround 680,000 mortgages.\nSo, what has become of the nearly 8 million households that entered forbearance and have since come\nout of it? Our researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been tracking this and have made some\nimportant findings.\nI’ll begin with the positive news. Nearly three-quarters of those who have exited forbearance have paid\noff or are performing, many making use of payment deferrals or loan modifications. For borrowers able\nto resume timely payment, a deferral creates a no-interest subordinated lien out of their missed\npayments not due until loan payoff. Meanwhile, loan modifications offer lower interest rates and extend\nloan terms up to 40 years while offering payment reductions of 20 percent or more.\nMoreover, our exceptionally strong housing market has kept home prices elevated. While this has had\nundeniably negative impacts on those seeking to enter the housing market, it does ensure that\nborrowers can avoid losing their homes and that banks won’t suffer losses large enough to meaningfully\naffect their capital positions. Homeowners are sitting on more than $10 trillion of tappable equity — a\nrecord. The contrast with the Great Recession is remarkable; you’ll recall back then that nearly half of all\ndistressed borrowers were “underwater.”\n4\n\n\fStill, nearly 1 million mortgages are seriously delinquent, split evenly between those classified by\nservicers as in loss mitigation and those not in loss mitigation. Most borrowers who remain seriously\ndelinquent and not in loss mitigation never entered forbearance at all. Many were in nonpayment\nbefore the pandemic struck.\nAnd of the borrowers classified as in loss mitigation, three-quarters are still in process and have not, as\nof yet, resumed timely payment on their mortgages. Black and Hispanic borrowers have much higher\nshares of nonpayment, either being in forbearance or delinquency. Interestingly, just as the\nunemployment rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels, the number of delinquent mortgages has also\nreturned to pre-pandemic rates.\nLenders may want to consider solutions that limit the costs of modification while providing more\npayment relief to borrowers. One such solution is for the Federal Housing Administration to offer 40year mortgage modifications. This will lower the cost relative to the 30-year option and provide more\nrelief to borrowers. While the Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a program\nto facilitate a 40-year mortgage, it has yet to materialize. It’s worth noting that protections against\nforeclosure expired on December 31, 2021, and foreclosure starts are back to their pre-pandemic levels\ntoo.\nMoney Market Funds and COVID-19\nNow, I’m certain you’re eager to grill me, but I want to close with a few words on what happened with\nmoney market funds (MMFs) almost exactly two years ago, just as the pandemic struck. I realize this is\nnot a happy memory, so apologies for bringing this up. COVID-19 may have been a true black swan\nevent — and we all fervently hope, a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience — but that must not preclude\nus from drawing lessons that we can use going forward.\nMarch 2020, you’ll recall, was characterized by a dash for cash. (It was also characterized by a dash for\ntoilet paper and hand sanitizer, but that is a story for another day.) Net outflows from prime MMFs,\nwhich provide crucial investment in various forms of short-term debt, was more than 17 percent —\nroughly equivalent to the outflows experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. All told, more than $140\nbillion evaporated from domestic MMFs between March 6 and March 26, 2020.\n\n5\n\n\fAs you can imagine, this run on MMFs imposed huge pressure on the kinds of short-term funding that\ncompanies rely on to stay afloat. The consequences for financial stability, and the U.S. economy at large,\nwere profound.\nSo, for the second time in 12 years, a significant outflow from MMFs ensured a concerted policy\nresponse. The Fed, in conjunction with the Treasury Department, stepped in, and on March 18, 2020, we\nannounced we were launching the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, which was formally\ninitiated on March 23. Ultimately, 47 out of 95 domestic prime MMFs accessed the facility.\nWhat’s important to note is that as soon as we announced the advent of the liquidity fund, outflows\nfrom MMFs declined substantially. From March 23 to the end of the month, outflows were $28 billion,\nand by April, these funds were actually seeing inflows. Correlation is not causation, of course, so we\ncan’t be sure it was solely the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility that provided this\nstabilization, though researchers at the New York Fed have found compelling data that suggest it did\nhave an effect.\nAnd indeed, one thing I noticed throughout the 2020 crisis was that every time we launched a new\nlending facility — and we ended up launching quite a few — the mere announcement of it had a fairly\nsignificant effect on calming markets, even before the facility was actually up and running.\nWhile the Fed’s actions were largely successful, I would argue that we do not want the public sector to\nstep in to aid MMFs for a third time. Proposals such as introducing swing pricing requirements,\neliminating redemption gates and liquidity fees tied to the level of weekly liquid assets at prime and taxexempt funds, and increases in liquid asset requirements for all funds are proposals well worth\nconsidering. When we say the Fed is the lender of last resort, we mean it.\nSo, again, thank you so much for having me. Interesting times call for, I’m certain, an interesting\ndiscussion, and now I’m happy to take questions.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nGood morning! It’s great to be here sharing a stage ― well, sharing a screen ― with so many friends\nfrom the chamber and elsewhere. I know this event is a highlight of the year for many of you, and I’m\nthrilled that there is such a robust turnout this morning ― even if we were forced by COVID-19 to come\ntogether virtually rather than in person as we had hoped.\nOf course, given that so many of you are old friends, I’m sure that many of you know what I’m about to\nsay next. That’s right, the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nWe’re here today to look ahead to what the year 2022 has in store. But I firmly believe we can’t hope to\naccurately project into the future unless we know what’s happening on the ground right now.\nWith that said, I hope you’ve had a chance to look at the results from the Chamber of Commerce for\nGreater Philadelphia’s annual member survey. They offer, to my mind, a clear picture of an economy\nmoving in the right direction, particularly compared with where we were a year ago. But to be clear, our\nsurvey indicates far from “smooth sailing” for chamber members. The economy is improving, yes, but\nstill freighted with risks and constraints.\nSurvey data are, to my mind, an underrated tool in the economics business. At the Fed, we look at\neverything from big broad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures like auto\nsales and even restaurant reservations. And in recent years, we’ve seen the growth of new data sources\nlike mobility data, which give us information on how much people are traveling and to where.\nNow, don’t worry ― I promise you that mobility information is anonymized. We take data security very,\nvery seriously.\n1\n\n\fBut with survey data, we can find out how people and businesses’ economic realities are playing out on\nthe ground. And that’s crucial to all of our understanding of how the economy is really working. I know\nthat as a policymaker, I find survey data invaluable.\nI invite you to delve deep into the survey results, which make for fascinating reading. But I also wanted\nto highlight just a few data points that jumped out at me.\nFirst is just how much things have improved for chamber members over the course of the past year. The\nvast majority of survey respondents indicated higher levels of economic activity in 2021 over 2020. A full\n56 percent of respondents reported either slightly or significantly higher volumes of new orders, and 72\npercent reported slightly or significantly higher sales or revenues in 2021 over the year before.\nOur survey respondents are optimistic that these trends will continue. Nearly three-quarters are\nexpecting slightly or significantly higher sales or revenues in 2022 compared with 2021. Nearly 60\npercent are either at or have exceeded their prepandemic employment levels.\nNow, with increased sales have come increased costs, particularly on the labor side; 92 percent of\nrespondents expect wage and benefit costs to either increase slightly or significantly in the coming year.\nThat probably goes a long way toward explaining why 47 percent of respondents cited wages and 35\npercent of respondents cited the availability of labor as their top concerns for their operations going\nforward.\nWhen it comes to labor supply issues, 56 percent of respondents had difficulty hiring in the past three\nmonths because of the lack of qualified applicants, while 29 percent said that candidates were not\nwilling to accept the compensation levels they were offering. And in a fascinating demonstration of how\nthe pandemic has changed the way we work, 17 percent of respondents reported that candidates\nrejected their offers because of the lack of a fully remote option. Keep in mind that these survey results\nare largely from before Omicron became widespread, which has further hampered efforts to keep\nemployees healthy and on the job.\nIn sum, things will keep improving as long as employers have enough workers to staff their businesses.\nGoing forward, employers are going to have to think creatively about how to attract and retain talent. In\nthe end, I believe we will all benefit from that.\nSo, thank you again for joining us this morning. And now, let me turn things back to Andrea.\n2\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s great to be here. Almost exactly a year ago, I addressed this same group and\nexpressed my hope that the next time we would be together it would be in person. Obviously I’m\ndisappointed that didn’t pan out, though I definitely think moving this event to virtual was the right and\nresponsible thing to do as we endure another surge of COVID-19. On the other hand, last year I also\nlamented the performance of the Eagles ― whereas this year, I’m sincerely looking forward to the Birds\nbeating the Bucs this weekend. Win some, lose some, in other words.\nSomething else I said last year was the standard Fed disclaimer, and that holds true this year as well. The\nviews I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nLooking Back\nThe title of this event is Economic Forecast, and I intend to talk a little bit about where the national and\nlocal economies are headed and the path of Federal Reserve policy over the next year. Then, we can\nmove on to our Q&A.\nI’m also a firm believer that you can’t look ahead without looking back and taking stock of what brought\nyou here. And I’ve found reviewing my remarks to this group from last year to be a useful exercise.\nBegin with the positive: During last year’s speech, I noted that about 5 million Americans had been fully\nvaccinated against COVID-19 ― less than 2 percent of our total population. Today, that number stands\nat about 61 percent. Our region is more heavily vaccinated than the national average: Nearly threequarters of those in Philadelphia are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\nWidespread immunity has been a boon to public health, and it has also buoyed our economy. While last\nyear I noted persistent unemployment, this year employers are dealing with a very different problem.\n\n1\n\n\fThere are labor shortages in many industries. That was, to be frank, unexpected ― as was last year’s\ninflation surge, which I will discuss in a bit.\nSo too was the persistence of the pandemic even after mass vaccinations. The euphoria many of us\nexperienced last spring when the vaccine campaign began in earnest has given way to some sense of\ndisappointment as new variants of COVID-19 have emerged and as many millions of Americans have\nrefused to be vaccinated. Particularly troubling is the Omicron variant, which, to some degree, evades\nthe protection afforded by vaccination ― though vaccines do continue to largely prevent serious illness.\nLooking Ahead: The National Economy\nSo, where are we headed? Let me begin by noting that, since early 2020, the U.S. economy has largely\ntracked the path of COVID-19. In spring 2020, we experienced our sharpest contraction on record as\npolicymakers put the U.S. economy into a medically induced coma, shuttering businesses and schools.\nSince then, we’ve recovered in fits and starts.\nIn the early days of the pandemic, I was often asked what “shape” the recovery would take. Would it be\na “V?” An “L?” A “U”? More often than not, I liked to say it would look a little bit like a “Nike swoosh” —\na sharp decline followed by a gradual upward climb. Today, I’d amend that to say it looks like a Nike\nswoosh drawn by somebody who has had one too many cups of coffee — i.e., me on many workdays.\nWe’re climbing undeniably upward, but it’s been a jagged path, largely a result of the virus’s wiles. You\ncan see hits to growth that coincided with last year’s winter surge, the emergence of the Delta variant\nlast summer, and now Omicron.\nWhat’s notable about Omicron is that, by and large, aside from a handful of jurisdictions implementing\nmask mandates, governments are not imposing public health measures that depress business activity.\nInstead, we are seeing a diminution in certain categories of consumer spending like restaurant dining,\nled by consumers seeking to avoid the virus. That’s been true throughout the pandemic, of course; many\nAmericans will not engage in normal economic activities if they don’t feel safe.\nBut by virtue of Omicron’s extraordinary transmissibility, we are also experiencing something novel\nduring the course of what has already been a novel pandemic: So many people are becoming infected\nsimultaneously that businesses can’t staff themselves. Airlines are canceling flights, restaurants are\nshuttering their kitchens, and big box retail locations are closing down temporarily. Simply put, too\nmany of their workers are sick with COVID-19.\n\n2\n\n\fAll in all, we’re estimating that last year’s GDP growth came in a little above 5 percent. I expect growth\nto be a little slower this year, perhaps in the range of 3 to 4 percent.\nThe first quarter will be tough, with Omicron continuing to spread throughout the country, shuttering\nbusinesses, keeping office workers at home and away from already struggling downtowns, and\npersuading wary consumers to stay home. Later in the year, even after Omicron has ― hopefully ―\nfaded, financial conditions should tighten and pandemic stimulus programs will wane, somewhat\ndepressing growth. So I don’t expect the kind of gangbusters growth we had in parts of 2020 and 2021\nwhen the economy emerged from pandemic-induced lockdowns.\nLooking Ahead: Federal Reserve Policy\nWhen I say financial conditions will “tighten,” I am of course referring to how the Fed will react to\neconomic conditions this year. After nearly two years of accommodation, I think we can expect a fair\namount of tightening in 2022.\nLet’s begin by taking a step back and thinking about the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. We are\ncharged by Congress, for one, to maintain stable prices. In practice, that translates to 2 percent inflation.\nLast year, we exceeded that number significantly. In December, annualized inflation came in at 7\npercent, the highest reading in nearly 40 years. Yes, some of this inflation spurt had to do with\nconditions unique to our pandemic economy ― consumer demand was strong, for instance, owing to\nfiscal relief, but supplies were constrained because of the virus.\nBut it’s clear that inflation is more persistent and higher than any of us want to see. Inflation is\neffectively a penalty on those with limited means. I’m also concerned that inflation expectations could\nbecome unanchored.\nThe second plank of our mandate is to ensure maximum employment. Now, at face value, it may seem\nthat the Fed has so far failed to meet that mandate during this pandemic period. After all, we still have\naround 3 million fewer people employed than we did in February 2020.\nBut this is not a standard economic downturn; there is plenty of demand in this economy, especially for\nlabor. What the economy is facing is a major supply shortage. It is simply not true ― with apologies to\nreporters in the audience ― that the economy created only 199,000 jobs in December, which is how the\nmedia reported it. The economy has created many, many millions of jobs over the past year. They just\nhaven’t been filled. Look at the unemployment rate, which measures those who are working or who are\n3\n\n\fseeking work. It’s at 3.9 percent right now, and we expect it to fall even further this year. There is no\nlack of labor demand.\nThere are many reasons that could explain the depressed labor supply, and I suspect it’s a combination\nof them that is responsible. Many Americans continue to fear going to work when COVID-19 is\nwidespread; others are having trouble finding someone to take care of their kids at a reasonable price.\nMillions of others have likely opted to retire, especially with their 401(k)s in such good health. And don’t\ndiscount the general reevaluation of life choices that the pandemic has spurred among many of us. Even\nhousing policy is a culprit here. High-cost areas like San Francisco, New York, and Boston will have a hard\ntime attracting new labor supply ― and keeping the workers they already have ― when housing is so\nruinously expensive.\nWhat do all of these explanations have in common? They have nothing to do with monetary policy.\nThe inescapable logical conclusion of this situation ― inflation higher than we want and a very robust\njobs market ― is to tighten monetary policy. I expect us to complete our taper of asset purchases by\nMarch. Then, we can probably expect a rate hike of 25 basis points. We could very well continue to raise\nrates throughout the year as the data evolve.\nIn other words, this is a very different situation than the one we were in when I joined you last year.\nLooking Ahead: The Regional Economy\nNow, before we move on to our Q&A, I’d like to talk just a bit about how the local economy is\nprogressing.\nAll in all, the Philadelphia area’s economy is continuing to make progress toward recovery, particularly in\nemployment. There have been steady gains in payroll employment, unemployment claims have reached\nnew lows, and the unemployment rate has continued to drop. Full recovery, however, is incomplete and\nvulnerable to ongoing challenges.\nThe immediate, as I’ve mentioned, is Omicron. Our contacts report the same issues we are seeing\nnationwide: increasing troubles keeping their doors open as scores of their workers fall sick. It’s been\nremarkable in our survey work to see how quickly this new variant has spread. In early December 2021,\nour contacts reported virtually no trouble keeping staff on the job. By the end of the month, the new\nvariant was everywhere, and these reports were widespread across all sectors.\n\n4\n\n\fTo put this in context, during the week ending January 2, more than 41 percent of Philadelphia MSA\nbusinesses surveyed by the census bureau reported a “moderate negative” pandemic effect on business\nand more than a quarter reported “large negative” effects. Only about 22 percent reported “little or no\neffect.” That’s apparent in other data; restaurant reservations and visits to retail stores are still well\nbelow where they were prior to the pandemic.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, leisure and hospitality remains the sector most affected by the pandemic, with\nemployment down by more than 40,000 in our region. Manufacturing, by contrast, remains relatively\nrobust, with employment largely recovered, recent Omicron challenges notwithstanding. Our region’s\nmanufacturers continue to report troubles accessing supplies, however.\nOne thing we aren’t lacking is office space, particularly as the pandemic keeps many white-collar\nworkers toiling away at home. Office vacancy rates in Center City are north of 17 percent. Moreover,\nmany tenants are shrinking their office footprints in anticipation of more hybrid work in the years to\ncome.\nIn Philadelphia, we can expect modest declines in office rents this year, and for lower-quality office\nspace to be converted to other uses, such as multifamily housing. And the continuing dearth of office\nworkers is having knock-on effects to the economy. SEPTA ridership is down by nearly half from before\nthe pandemic. Our central business district has recovered only about 46 percent of the jobs that were\nlost at the outset of the pandemic.\nHousing prices, by contrast, are strong. In the fall, home price growth in Philadelphia County was around\n8 percent. Nearby counties in Greater Philadelphia had home price growth ranging between 12 percent\nand 20 percent.\nAnd, by the way, in case there are any former nurses in the audience, you might want to consider\ndusting off your RN certification. The most in-demand jobs in our region are for nurses.\nLooking Ahead: Football\nIf there is one thing that this pandemic has taught us, it is the certainty of uncertainty. As always, the\nFed ― and I’m sure, all of you ― will adapt to conditions as they continue to shift under our feet.\nSo, thank you again for having me, and I’m looking forward to our Q&A. I’m also looking forward to\ndoing this again next year ― in person ― and celebrating the Eagles’ remarkable 2022 playoff run.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fFintech and Financial Inclusion\nThe Fifth Annual Fintech Conference\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nNovember 16, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello! On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and our partner organizations, I’d like to\nadd my welcome to our Fifth Annual Fintech Conference. It’s great to be here today among such a great\ngroup of speakers and panelists as we discuss the latest developments in financial technologies, their\nimpacts, and the appropriate policy response. I’m particularly delighted to delve into how fintech can\npromote financial inclusion. I know these conversations are of much interest to you whether you\nhappen to be an academic, industry practitioner, regulator, economist ― or, well, a Federal Reserve\nBank president.\nWith that in mind, there is a bit of Federal Reserve policy I need to dispense with before I can continue.\nThat is the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nHistorical Echoes\nWhile we are discussing cutting-edge technologies this week, in a way, many new fintech tools are in\nessence digitized versions of practices that existed in the past. Before the advent of the modern credit\nscore, for instance, lenders took the kind of expansive look at borrowers that open banking today makes\nsignificantly more technologically efficient.\nAnd versions of “buy now pay later” have been in widespread use across Latin America since long before\nwe all became tethered to our cell phones. Or, thought about another way, buy now pay later is actually\nan updated version of Kmart’s old layaway system ― with the main difference being you get the product\nat the beginning of the process rather than at the end.\nAnd yes, I realize I’m dating myself by referring to Kmart.\n1\n\n\fBut the point is that one of the reasons to be bullish about the widespread adoption of these\ntechnologies is that they have been used successfully in other, more analog, forms in the past. Fintech\nmakes them more efficient and easier to disseminate.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nThere are great opportunities here. New methods of assessing credit through open banking offer the\npossibility of promoting financial inclusion by, for example, expanding the scope of which data lenders\nconsider and how they are used in predicting risk. Why shouldn’t a history of on-time rent or utility\npayments serve to make someone creditworthy? While there are a few exceptions, these are not\nelements included in most credit scores used by most lenders today. Many consumers trying to get their\nfirst loan find themselves in the paradoxical situation of needing to have established credit already in\norder to obtain new credit.\nBut, of course, the level of access that open banking provides also comes with significant risks. Would a\nlender penalize would-be borrowers when he sees they spend money at a dollar store rather than at a\nfancy department store? (Or perhaps vice versa.) All sorts of implicitly biased cultural judgments could\ncome into play here, which would have the perverse effect of perpetuating, rather than mitigating, longstanding patterns of unequal treatment.\nThere is significant historical precedence for this. In the pre-credit score era I alluded to earlier, lenders\nhad a much wider latitude when considering a person’s creditworthiness. But that meant all sorts of\npersonal biases could ― and often did ― play a huge role in allocating credit, with particularly unfair\noutcomes for minority communities.\nFintech in and of itself is value neutral, in other words. It is a tool. And it is a tool that can be used to\npromote financial inclusion, or a tool that can be used to perpetuate long-standing biases. And that is\nbecause, fundamentally, humans are responsible for the way financial technologies operate.\nConsider the question of fintech’s role in allocating credit.\nFintech and Loans\nFintech platforms are increasingly playing a role in issuing loans ― both new stand-alone platforms and\nestablished lenders are using artificial intelligence to make these decisions. But rather than remove\nhuman judgment from the process, these technologies have instead shifted where in the process human\n2\n\n\fjudgment comes in. It used to be at the end: A lender would collect the information she deemed\nnecessary and then render a decision. Today, it comes at the beginning of the process when algorithms\nare being designed and trained.\nThink of all the human judgments that need to be made when training an algorithm.\nFirst, people must be aware of how the data being used to train the algorithm were collected and\ncleaned. And what were their original purposes, given that most of these data were collected for\npurposes other than how they are being used in this particular algorithm? That answer, after all, has\nimplications for the data themselves ― especially given inherent selection biases of commission or\nomission.\nThen there is the question of which determinations will be made by the algorithm. Is it offering a simple\nYes or No on issuing a loan? Or is it also deciding on the size of the credit line, including for an account\nthat already exists? Or is it determining the rate offered? Will it decide who to market loans to? Or what\nmessages to stress when doing that marketing? Does it decide the strategy for managing an existing\naccount that exhibits increasing risk or a departure from the consumer’s normal pattern of using the\naccount? Does it determine who is eligible for a work-out program and on what terms? Is it used to\ndetermine collection strategies for accounts in default? What information is communicated to the\nconsumer about the whys of a decision made by models that many of us view as a black box?\nThe humans in attendance today, in other words, can rest easy: We are not obsolete yet.\nConclusion\nWill fintech platforms promote financial inclusion? They certainly can ― and, in my view, absolutely\nshould. But whether they do this is up to all of us ― industry, academia, our elected leaders, and\nregulators.\nThat’s why this week’s series of conversations is so crucial. So thank you again for joining us.\nAnd now, it is my distinct honor to welcome our next guests, Anthony Eisen and Larry Summers.\nAnthony Eisen is cofounder and CEO of Afterpay. He has more than 25 years of experience in investing,\npublic company directorships, and providing corporate advice across a variety of sectors. Prior to\ncofounding Afterpay, Anthony was the chief investment officer at the Guinness Peat Group, where he\nwas actively involved in a number of financial services, software, and technology companies.\n3\n\n\fWe’re also thrilled to have Larry Summers with us today. Larry is the Charles W. Eliot University\nProfessor and President Emeritus at Harvard University. In addition to serving as 71st Secretary of the\nTreasury in the Clinton administration, he was director of the White House National Economic Council in\nthe Obama administration, president of Harvard University, and the chief economist of the World Bank.\nSo, thank you again. And now let’s continue with the conference.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fThe Economy, Inflation, and Housing\nEconomic Club of New York\nNew York, NY (virtual)\nNovember 8, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello! It’s an honor to be here today to talk a little bit about our country’s economic outlook, Federal\nReserve policy, and some recent research on housing that I think will be of particular interest to this\ngroup. I’ve long wanted to have a conversation with all of you at the Economic Club of New York, though\nI must admit that when I used to envision it, I thought we’d be doing it in 3D. Soon enough, I hope.\nI’m really looking forward to our dialogue ― especially the fireside chat and Q&A after my prepared\nremarks ― but before I begin, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe State of the Recovery\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, I was often asked what “shape” the recovery would take. Would it be\na “V?” An “L?” A “U”? More often than not, I liked to say it would look a little bit like a “Nike swoosh” ―\na sharp decline followed by a gradual upward climb.\nIf I could amend that prediction today, I would put it this way: Our recovery looks like a Nike swoosh\ndrawn by somebody who has had one too many cups of coffee ― i.e., me on many workdays. We’re\nclimbing undeniably upward, but it’s a jagged path. And our turbulent recovery has been shaped largely,\nas so much has, by the path of COVID-19.\nConsider this: The second quarter of 2020 saw our economy’s sharpest contraction on record as COVID19 reached our shores. This, of course, was largely intentional as states shuttered businesses and\nschools and ordered citizens to stay home in a bid to contain the virus. We put our economy, effectively,\ninto a medical coma.\n\n1\n\n\fThe economy jolted quickly awake that summer as states reopened and a large dose of fiscal relief was\ninjected into American households and businesses. But then last winter’s tragic COVID-19 surge ensured\nthe economy went sideways. This was followed by another growth spurt earlier this year as vaccines\nwere introduced and COVID-19 rates plummeted. And then the Delta variant showed up and, once\nagain, growth slowed markedly.\nSo in 2021, GDP growth in the first half of the year was around 6½ percent, while the second half will be\nsignificantly slower. I expect the full year to come in around 5½ percent. Next year, if another major\nCOVID-19 wave can be avoided ― and I think it can, given widespread vaccinations and natural\nimmunity among those who’ve recovered from the virus ― we should see another growth spurt to more\nthan 4 percent before the economy returns to something approaching trend growth of 2 percent to 3\npercent in 2023.\nThe economy is continuing to recover, in other words. But it is doing so under constraints.\nConstraints\nThe first constraint is a lack of people ― labor. Despite very robust jobs gains in October, the U.S.\neconomy has still created many millions of jobs in recent months that haven’t been filled.\nJob openings, sitting around 10 million, are at near-record highs, running at double their long-term\naverage. So is the rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs.\nLayoff rates, meanwhile, are at series lows. And those people who are working are putting in longer\nhours and commanding higher wages; average hourly earnings are up more than 4½ percent from 2020.\nIt seems that a combination of factors — trouble accessing childcare or eldercare, lingering fears about\nthe virus, the rise in equities and home values spurring people to retire, and perhaps a general\nrevaluation of life choices — is persuading many Americans to stay on the sidelines even as the\neconomy has reopened. And notably, the elimination of extra federal unemployment benefits has not —\nat least not yet — appeared to nudge people back into the workforce. I do expect that will change\neventually and especially as other forbearance programs run out. There is also a spatial-geographic\ncomponent to unfilled jobs, which I will discuss further when we get to housing issues.\nThe other constraint hampering economic growth is a lack of stuff. Supply chains are badly hobbled,\nleading to shortages of everything from new vehicles to home appliances to chicken wings.\n\n2\n\n\fManufacturers curtailed production as the pandemic set in and are now working furiously to ramp up ―\nbut it’s taking time. And this is occurring as demand is very strong because household balance sheets are\nin such good shape.\nThe result of this equation ― a lack of goods coupled with high demand ― is, of course, inflation. And\nindeed, inflation readings are now at 30-year highs; core inflation was up more than 3½ percent from a\nyear ago in September, and headline inflation was up nearly 5½ percent.\nMoreover, inflation is more widespread across products and services than it was earlier this year. In the\nthird quarter, nearly three-quarters of spending on goods and services in the CPI “basket” was on goods\nthat displayed annualized inflation of more than 4 percent; in the second quarter, that was true for only\na little more than a third of the goods and services that comprise the basket.\nI am acutely aware that this period of rising prices is painful for many Americans. But I do expect\ninflation to moderate next year as supply chains come back online and bottlenecks ease.\nWith economic growth chugging along and job creation ― if not job filling ― so robust, the FOMC\nannounced last week that we will begin tapering our purchases of mortgage-backed securities and\nTreasury bills by $15 billion a month. I don’t expect that the federal funds rate will rise before the\ntapering is complete, but we are monitoring inflation very closely and are prepared to take action,\nshould circumstances warrant it.\nRenters\nOne thing I’ve noticed in my travels is that when you’re in Los Angeles, you always end up talking about\nthe traffic ― how it was bumper to bumper on the 405 or the 101. When you’re in Philadelphia,\nmeanwhile, you always end up talking about the Eagles ― although, let’s please not do that today … it’s\ntoo painful.\nAnd I’ve also found that whenever you’re in New York, you end up discussing housing, and specifically\nhousing costs. Which is why I’m delighted to share some recent research from the Philadelphia Federal\nReserve about this most important topic. One of the pleasures of my job as a Reserve Bank president is\ntalking about all of the pathbreaking research we do besides that which is directly related to monetary\npolicy.\n\n3\n\n\fI’d like to begin with renters, who often get short shrift in our national political conversation, despite\nmaking up more than 35 percent of all Americans ― and disproportionately higher numbers in big cities\nlike Philadelphia and New York.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, Congress passed a moratorium on evictions. This, in a way,\nfunctioned like mortgage forbearance; with evictions no longer a risk, many Americans who were\nstruggling stopped paying their rent either partially or in full. And while the eviction moratorium did,\nthankfully, prevent people from losing their homes, those rent payments didn’t go away ― they became\ndebt owed by the tenants.\nResearchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been tracking rental debt to understand which households are\nburdened and how significantly. This is especially urgent now that the eviction moratorium has expired.\nThis month, our economists project, roughly 1.9 million households carry COVID-19‒related rental debt,\nor about 6 percent of all renter households. And they carry an average debt of nearly $9,000 ― a severe\nburden for unemployed or underemployed households.\nCongress has made aid available to many renters who are struggling, but there have been persistent\nproblems throughout the pandemic in getting that vital support into the hands of those who need it the\nmost.\nAs part of our understanding of how the pandemic is affecting people on the ground, the Philadelphia\nFed has been conducting a series called the CFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers. And those surveys have\nconsistently found that many renters are, unfortunately, simply unaware of the aid that they qualify for\nor how to go about obtaining it. As of last month, roughly 43 percent of renters who say they require\nassistance had not applied for it. Clearly, this is a problem: No matter how well intentioned or well\ndesigned a program is, it can hardly be judged a triumph if nearly half the people who would benefit\nfrom it are not partaking in it.\nAs we emerge from the pandemic, I would also urge policymakers to not only make sure indebted\nhouseholds have access to the funds intended for them, but also to think creatively about ways to\nreduce rents, including reforming zoning regulations to induce more residential construction.\nThere is evidence, in fact, that high rents may be affecting the labor market and hindering efforts to get\nus back to full employment. That’s because many workers can’t afford to live where jobs are. It’s tough\nto ask somebody to work in a restaurant in San Francisco, for instance, when the nearest place with\n4\n\n\faffordable housing may be in, say, Fresno. This not only hinders attempts to fill jobs, but, ultimately, it\ndegrades the economic performance of areas with expensive housing. Expensive metro areas are not\nachieving their full economic potential because millions of would-be participants simply can’t afford to\nbe there.\nHomeowners\nNow, I’d like to turn to homeowners. As I’m sure this audience is aware, the CARES Act provided for\nmortgage forbearance, allowing borrowers to stop paying on their houses for up to a year and a half.\nEarlier this year, my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed set out to answer two central questions about\nthis program. First: What is the extent of racial and income disparities among mortgage borrowers in\nnonpayment on their mortgages, and how has the pandemic affected these disparities? Then, they\nwanted to find out who took up forbearance on their mortgages and who missed this important\nopportunity.\nBecause the CARES Act mandates that borrowers in forbearance who aren’t paying on their mortgages\nstill be reported to credit bureaus as if they are paying, these turned out to be surprisingly tricky\nquestions to answer. But through some quite clever methods — my Philadelphia Fed colleagues are\nnothing if not ingenious — the researchers were able to suss out the data.\nHere is what they found: Between April and November 2020, an acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis,\nminorities’ and lower-income borrowers’ nonpayment rates were twice as high as for higher-income and\nWhite borrowers.\nEven if we compare borrowers with the same credit score and the same loan type, Black and Hispanic\nborrowers have more than 30 percent higher rates of nonpayment, and lower-income borrowers, 50\npercent higher. Moreover, and importantly, these disparities largely did not exist pre-COVID-19.\nIn a sign that the CARES Act was effective, my colleagues found that minority and lower-income\nborrowers took up forbearances at significantly higher rates than other groups.\nThe rub, of course, is that under the CARES Act and subsequent extension from the Biden\nadministration, forbearance lasts only up to 18 months, meaning many borrowers will be coming off of\nit by the end of the year, which is also when temporary protections against foreclosure are set to expire.\n\n5\n\n\fThat’s concerning, given that as of mid-October, about 15 percent of people who went into forbearance\nin the first place are still in it — an estimated 1.1 million borrowers. And as with rental debt, those\nmissed payments just didn’t go away. They are now additional debt burdening households who went\ninto forbearance.\nThe good news is that most of the 8 million or so households that took forbearance during the crisis\nhave fully recovered. Due in part to the booming housing market, which has seen a 20 percent gain in\nhouse prices nationally since the onset of the pandemic, more than two-thirds of households came out\nof forbearance and are either current on their mortgages or have paid off or refinanced them.\nBorrowers still unable to resume full payments are being offered payment reductions to the tune of 20\nto 25 percent. While it is still early, some borrowers in need of assistance have started to take advantage\nof these home-retention programs.\nStill, about 20 percent of borrowers are either still in forbearance or are now delinquent. Banks,\nmeanwhile, report being unable to contact many borrowers who have stopped paying to work out new\nterms.\nThat presents a challenge to borrowers first and foremost, of course, but also to lenders given the\nexpense and hassle involved in foreclosure.\nKeeping people in their homes isn’t only vital because of the first order issue of shelter — it’s also crucial\nto wealth building. A person’s house may be their castle. But in many cases, it is also their savings\naccount. This is, in part, because homeowners can borrow against their home’s value to boost their\nlifetime earnings and capital gains. Here, there is a silver lining to the current economic environment;\nwhereas during the Great Recession, nearly half of distressed borrowers were “underwater,” meaning\ntheir mortgage was larger than their home’s actual value; today, only around 2 percent are.\nThe nation’s racial wealth gap owes much to both unequal rates of homeownership among groups and\namong disparate housing values — often a legacy of direct government policy. Using a series of\ngeospatial maps, Philadelphia Fed researchers have found that properties with covenants within the city\nof Philadelphia from 1920 to 1932 formed an invisible barrier to less densely populated areas sought\nafter by White residents and around predominantly White neighborhoods throughout the city — and\nthat those effects are still visible a century later. This too is an issue that will require deliberate policy\naction to redress.\n\n6\n\n\fUltimately, we must all work to make sure that all Americans can build wealth and participate fully in\nthe U.S. economy — and housing policy is a big part of that.\nI’m eager to discuss this and much else besides during our fireside chat. And for more information on\nthis and other research, please do check out our recently redesigned website: philadelphiafed.org.\nThank you again so much for having me. And now let’s move on to the discussion.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fEconomic Outlook: Growth Despite Constraints\nThe Prosperity Caucus\nWashington, D.C. (virtual)\nOctober 14, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood evening! Thanks so much for having me. I understand that when this group meets in person there\nis usually pizza involved ― so I intend to collect on that debt next time we do this in the flesh.\nI plan to offer a few remarks about the state of the national economy and the path of Federal Reserve\npolicy. Then we can move to our Q&A, which I’m really looking forward to.\nBut before I do that, I need to give you the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nor in the Federal Reserve System.\nFed Structure\nI know this group encompasses a very diverse crowd ― we have everyone from House staffers to Senate\nstaffers here. So, just in case anyone doesn’t know, I want to begin by giving you a very brief explanation\nof what, exactly, a regional Federal Reserve Bank is. Our nation’s central bank, after all, is quite unusual\n― unique, even ― in its design.\nThe configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a decentralized structure —\nowes its existence to the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. It is something of a testament to old-fashioned\nAmerican compromise and reflects the unique demands of the United States and our economy.\nThe System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, and 12 regional Banks around\nthe country.\nThe Board seats seven governors, including the Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and\nboard of directors, which is made up of business, banking, and community leaders from the area.\nFundamentally, this provides the Fed with a perspective ― within each District ― of the sectors and\n1\n\n\fissues that make the region tick. Mine is the Third District, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania,\nSouth Jersey, and the state of Delaware. We’re the smallest District geographically, but I like to think we\npunch above our weight.\nThe FOMC, which is responsible for monetary policy, is composed of the Fed’s governors and regional\nBank presidents. Regional Bank presidents don’t always get to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting\nposition every three years, but the governors always vote, as does the president of the New York Fed.\nNew York, owing to the presence of Wall Street, enjoys something of a “first among equals” status\nwithin the System.\nWhile the rest of us don’t always vote, we do always represent our Districts and play a part in the\ndiscussion. If you were at a normal FOMC meeting, you probably wouldn’t be able to tell a voting\nmember until the end of the meeting when it’s time to raise hands. Everybody contributes.\nThe Fed’s decentralized nature is, in my view, a unique strength. We’re making national policy, but\nwe’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data can obscure realities on the\nground. Conditions look very different in Philadelphia, Dover, or Washington than they do in Dallas, Salt\nLake City, or Honolulu. This System gives a voice to a range of localities and sectors. It also allows us to\nfocus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because we’re such\na massive country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China and India have larger\npopulations, and no one country has a bigger economy, at least for now. And that economy is vast,\nspreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that is not typical of other nations.\nSo, it makes sense that we have a System that feeds back information from around the country.\nThe State of the Economy\nAnd what that information is telling us is that, for the past 18 months, the economy has moved in\ntandem with the waxing and waning of the COVID-19 pandemic. During periods when case rates and\nhospitalizations have declined, the economy has surged as American consumers have voted with their\nwallets. When COVID-19 risks abate, more Americans dine out at restaurants, check in to hotels, and fill\nup airplanes. Those are important categories of spending in a country where consumption makes up\nabout 70 percent of total economic activity. In the second quarter of this year, for instance, GDP grew at\na very healthy annualized rate of around 6.7 percent as case rates plummeted.\n2\n\n\fAnd, of course, the opposite occurs during periods when the virus spikes. When the Delta variant of\nCOVID-19 erupted, fomenting the country’s fourth major wave of the pandemic, things started moving\nsideways. Consumer confidence tanked, and large industries like hospitality and leisure stagnated at\nbest. So for this quarter, we can expect growth to come in at an annualized rate of around 3 percent, a\nsharp slowdown from earlier this year.\nBut there are reasons to be sanguine that the country’s recovery from this wave of COVID-19 may prove\nmore durable than in the past and that we can avoid a fifth wave. And that is because more than half of\nthe country is fully vaccinated. Getting more shots into arms will save lives and aid the recovery by\nreducing the size and severity of future spikes. The Delta variant has also concentrated minds: It seems\nto have not only persuaded more Americans to get shots on their own, but it also pushed more\ncorporations and institutions to mandate their employees to get vaccinated. That is cause for optimism.\nFilling me with less optimism is the persistent constraints the economy is operating under.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has revealed how fragile many of our supply chains are. We’re now\nexperiencing shortages of crucial parts like computer chips, which has hobbled not only the production\nof cars and trucks, but also comparatively smaller durable goods like home appliances. My recent\nexperience attempting to purchase a printer ― there were essentially none at my local electronics store\n― testifies to that. And good luck trying to find a new washing machine or dishwasher.\nThese supply chain constraints are rippling through the entire economy. Manufacturers in our region\nhave reported having to curtail production because of difficulties securing raw materials. We’re also\nseeing low inventory of everything from shoes to backpacks to even chicken wings, which is a\nparticularly troubling development as the NFL season is picking up. Unfortunately, there are indications\nthat these constraints could persist for a couple of more years.\nThere’s another input lacking in supply as well, further constraining the economy: labor. It isn’t true, as\nwas widely reported, that the economy only created 194,000 jobs in September. In reality, the U.S.\neconomy has created many millions of jobs in recent months ― we just can’t fill them. Indeed, job\nopenings are at record highs, hitting nearly 10.5 million at the end of August. Simultaneously, more\npeople are quitting their jobs, and the rate at which open positions are being filled is continuing to slow.\nIt seems that a combination of factors ― trouble accessing childcare or eldercare, lingering fears about\nthe virus, the rise in equities and home values spurring people to retire, and perhaps a general\nrevaluation of life choices ― is persuading a lot of Americans to stay on the sidelines even as the\n3\n\n\feconomy has reopened. And notably, the elimination of extra federal unemployment benefits has not —\nat least not yet — appeared to nudge people back into the workforce. I do expect that will change\neventually and especially as other forbearance programs run out.\nSo, where does all of this leave us? For 2021, I would expect GDP growth to come in around 5.5 percent,\nwhich is a downward revision from before Delta took hold. Growth will then moderate to about 3.5\npercent in 2022, and 2.5 percent in 2023. Inflation, meanwhile, should come in around 4 percent for\n2021, though I do see upside risk here. After that, our modal forecast ― that is, the average of all of our\nforecasts ― calls for inflation of a bit over 2 percent for 2022 and right at 2 percent in 2023.\nFed Policy\nIn terms of monetary policy, I am in the camp that believes it will soon be time to begin slowly and\nmethodically — frankly, boringly — taper our $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasury bills and\nmortgage-backed securities. This comes down to the efficacy of these purchases as a tool.\nThey were necessary to keep markets functioning during the acute phase of the crisis. But to the extent\nthat we are still dealing with a labor force issue, the problem lies on the supply side, not with demand.\nYou can’t go into a restaurant or drive down a commercial strip without noticing a sea of “Help Wanted”\nsigns. Asset purchases aren’t doing much — or anything — to ameliorate that.\nAfter we taper our asset purchases, we can begin to think about raising the federal funds rate. But I\nwouldn’t expect any hikes to interest rates until late next year or early 2023, unless the inflation picture\nchanges dramatically.\nConclusion\nGiven the strong headwinds facing the economy, it is a testament to its underlying strength that growth\ncontinues at a relatively robust pace. That is a tribute, as always, to the ingenuity and tenacity of our\npeople, especially in the face of huge challenges.\nThank you very much again for having me. And now let’s move on to questions.\n\n4\n\n\f"

It’s great to be back in Delaware without having to fight the traffic on I-95.\nI’m honored to be addressing today’s luncheon — please go ahead and start your salad. To begin, I’d like\nto sketch out just a few brief remarks about the state of the economy and the path of Federal Reserve\npolicy, and then we can turn things over to a Q&A.\nBut before I do that, I need to give you the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nFor the past 18 months, the U.S. economy has moved in tandem with the waxing and waning of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. During periods when case rates and hospitalizations have declined, the economy\nhas surged as American consumers have voted with their feet — and their wallets. When COVID-19 risks\nabate, more Americans dine out at restaurants, check in to hotels, and — much to the chagrin of their\nfellow passengers who were hoping to stuff their luggage in the overhead compartments — fill up\nairplanes. Those are important categories of spending in a country where consumption makes up about\n70 percent of total economic activity. In the second quarter of this year, for instance, GDP grew at a very\nhealthy annualized rate of around 6.5 percent as case rates plummeted.\nAnd, of course, the opposite occurs during periods when the virus spikes. When the Delta variant of\nCOVID-19 erupted, fomenting the country’s fourth major wave of the pandemic, things started moving\nsideways. Consumer confidence tanked, and large industries like hospitality and leisure stagnated at\n\n1\n\n\fbest. So for this quarter, we can expect growth to come in at an annualized rate of between 3 and 4\npercent, a sharp slowdown from earlier this year.\nBut there are reasons to be sanguine that the country’s recovery from this wave of COVID-19 may prove\nmore durable than in the past. And that’s because more than half of the country is now fully vaccinated.\nGetting more shots into arms will save lives and aid the recovery by reducing the size and severity of\nfuture COVID-19 waves. The Delta variant has also concentrated minds: It seems to have not only\npersuaded more Americans to get shots on their own, but it also pushed more corporations and\ninstitutions to mandate their employees to get vaccinated. That is cause for optimism.\nStill, headwinds remain. Supply chain constraints are a powerful one, as shortages of crucial parts like\ncomputer chips have hobbled not only the production of cars and trucks, but also comparatively smaller\ndurable goods like home appliances. (Yes, there are computer chips in your washing machine; we’ve\ncome a long way since the days of the washboard.) One of our business contacts, a major homebuilder,\ntells us he’s now selling new homes with used appliances in them with the promise that he’ll replace\nthem as soon as he can. Manufacturers in our region are also reporting being hamstrung by supply chain\nissues. Unfortunately, there are indications that these constraints could persist for the next couple of\nyears.\nThere’s another input lacking in supply as well: labor. Job openings are at record highs, hitting nearly 11\nmillion at the end of July. Meanwhile, more people are quitting their jobs, and the rate at which open\npositions are being filled is continuing to slow. The upshot, of course, is better pay for those who are\nworking: Wages are up more than 4 percent year over year.\nIt’s clear that a combination of factors — trouble accessing childcare or eldercare, lingering fears about\nthe virus, the rise in equities and home values spurring people to retire, and perhaps a general\nrevaluation of life choices — is persuading a lot of Americans to stay on the sidelines even as the\neconomy has reopened. And notably, the elimination of extra federal unemployment benefits has not\nnoticeably — at least not yet — appeared to nudge people back into the workforce.\nHere in Delaware, there are strong signs of economic recovery. Nearly 70 percent of adults are fully\nvaccinated, and various economic metrics are trending in a positive direction.\nOn the jobs front, the unemployment rate in Delaware was 5.4 percent in August, representing a huge\nimprovement from April 2020 when the jobless rate was 13.4 percent. But there is still some ground to\nbe made up: In February 2020, unemployment stood at 4.5 percent. Employment in financial services\n2\n\n\fand manufacturing is either at or very close to prepandemic numbers, though there is still ground to be\nmade up in leisure and hospitality. In terms of unfilled job openings, the most in-demand roles in the\nstate are registered nurses, applications software developers, and customer service representatives.\nThe housing market continues to perform well. The state’s year-over-year home price growth in July was\naround 16.2. Home price growth in Sussex County has been even stronger at around 20 percent. Exports\nhave rebounded significantly, too, with healthy growth in the outbound shipment of chemicals,\ncomputers and electronics, and transportation equipment.\nOn the national level, for 2021, I would expect GDP growth to come in at around 6.5 percent. It will then\nmoderate to about 3.5 percent in 2022, and 2.5 percent in 2023. Inflation, meanwhile, should come in\naround 4 percent for 2021 — we’re already seeing some moderation there, as prices of used cars finally\nstabilize. After that, we can expect inflation of a bit over 2 percent for 2022 and right at 2 percent in\n2023. Unemployment should fall steadily during this period as well.\nDownside risks include persistent supply chain issues or yet another resurgence of the virus. And in the\nshort term, a failure by Congress to raise the debt ceiling could harm economic growth significantly.\nIn terms of monetary policy, I am in the camp that believes it will soon be time to begin slowly and\nmethodically — frankly, boringly — tapering our $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasury bills and\nmortgage-backed securities. Those purchases were necessary to keep markets functioning during the\nacute phase of the crisis. But to the extent that we are still dealing with a labor force issue, the problem\nlies on the supply side, not with demand. You can’t go into a restaurant or drive down a commercial\nstrip without noticing a sea of “Help Wanted” signs. Asset purchases aren’t doing much — or anything\n— to ameliorate that.\nAfter we taper our asset purchases, we can begin to think about raising the federal funds rate. But I\nwouldn’t expect any hikes to interest rates until late next year or early 2023.\nNow, before we move to our Q&A, I’d like to share just a little bit of information from our most recent\nCFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers. One of the pleasures of this job is sharing some of the research we\ndo with audiences like you.\nSince April 2020, the Philadelphia Fed has been conducting a series of national surveys that focus on\nchanges in job status, income levels, and personal financial security. The economic data we have access\nto at the Fed — and believe me, we look at a ton of data — are an extraordinary resource. But it’s\n3\n\n\fimportant, too, to understand how people’s economic realities are playing out on the ground. Our\nCOVID-19 surveys have been instrumental in allowing us to do that.\nI’d encourage all of you to take a look at our series of surveys on our website — philadelphiafed.org —\nbut I’d like to point out just a few important data points from the latest survey, which was done this\nsummer as Delta surged.\nFirst, more people were feeling more confident about their personal finances this summer than they\nwere in the spring. More were working normal hours, and more were working onsite, rather than\nremotely, and 10.9 percent of respondents reported being currently laid off or furloughed, down from\n17.9 percent last fall.\nBut when it came to expectations about the future, the survey found wide disparities across groups.\nWomen, people making less than $40,000 a year, and people under the age of 36 were much more\npessimistic about their earnings over the next year than men and older people, for instance. The good\nnews is, across all survey respondents, the number of people reporting they are having trouble making\nends meet has been declining.\nThe headline of this iteration of the survey is “Cautious Optimism Reigns,” which I’d say captures my\nsentiment regarding the economy as well.\nSo, thanks again so much for having me. And now, let’s move on to questions.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nRisk Management Association\nPhiladelphia Chapter\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nSeptember 29, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s great to be back with this group, though given that we’re meeting virtually, we\nunfortunately had to make it a BYOB — bring your own breakfast, I mean, of course.\nI note that the title of this event is “A Virtual Conversation with Philadelphia Federal Reserve President\nPatrick T. Harker,” and I’m really looking forward to that part of the morning. But before we get to the\nQ&A, I’d like to sketch out just a few brief remarks about the state of the national economy and the path\nof Federal Reserve policy.\nBut before I can even do that, there is another bit of Fed policy I must adhere to. And that is the\nstandard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nFor the past 18 months, the U.S. economy has moved in tandem with the waxing and waning of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.

You’re a group of risk management professionals, so I probably don’t\nneed to tell you this, but vaccines are by far the most effective way to mitigate the risks of both catching\n— and also getting seriously ill — from the virus.\nThe good news here is that more than half the country is fully vaccinated. In our tri-state region,\nmeanwhile, vaccination rates are above the national average. Getting more shots into arms will save\nlives and aid the recovery by reducing the size and severity of future COVID-19 waves. The Delta variant\nhas also concentrated minds: It seems to have not only persuaded more Americans to get shots on their\nown, but it also pushed more corporations and institutions to mandate their employees to get\nvaccinated.

Meanwhile, more people are quitting their jobs, and the rate at which open\npositions are being filled is continuing to slow. The upshot, of course, is better pay for those who are\nworking: Wages are up more than 4 percent year over year.\nIt’s clear that a combination of factors — trouble accessing childcare or eldercare, lingering fears about\nthe virus, the rise in equities and home values spurring people to retire, and perhaps a general\nrevaluation of life choices — is persuading a lot of Americans to stay on the sidelines even as the\n2\n\n\feconomy has reopened. And notably, the elimination of extra federal unemployment benefits has not\nnoticeably — at least not yet — appeared to nudge people back into the workforce.\nSo, where does all of this leave us? For 2021, I would expect GDP growth to come in at around 6.5\npercent. It will then moderate to about 3.5 percent in 2022, and 2.5 percent in 2023. Inflation,\nmeanwhile, should come in around 4 percent for 2021 — we’re already seeing some moderation there,\nas prices of used cars finally stabilize. After that, we can expect inflation of a bit over 2 percent for 2022\nand right at 2 percent in 2023. Unemployment should fall steadily during this period as well.\nDownside risks include persistent supply chain issues or yet another resurgence of the virus. And in the\nshort term, a failure by Congress to raise the debt ceiling could harm economic growth significantly.\nIn terms of monetary policy, I am in the camp that believes it will soon be time to begin slowly and\nmethodically — frankly, boringly — tapering our $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasury bills and\nmortgage-backed securities. Those purchases were necessary to keep markets functioning during the\nacute phase of the crisis. But to the extent that we are still dealing with a labor force issue, the problem\nlies on the supply side, not with demand. You can’t go into a restaurant or drive down a commercial\nstrip without noticing a sea of “Help Wanted” signs. Asset purchases aren’t doing much — or anything\n— to ameliorate that.\nAfter we taper our asset purchases, we can begin to think about raising the federal funds rate. But I\nwouldn’t expect any hikes to interest rates until late next year or early 2023.\nNow, before we move to our Q&A, I’d like to share just a little bit of information from our most recent\nCFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers. One of the pleasures of this job is sharing some of the research we\ndo with audiences like you.\nSince April 2020, the Philadelphia Fed has been conducting a series of national surveys that focus on\nchanges in job status, income levels, and personal financial security. The economic data we have access\nto at the Fed — and believe me, we look at a ton of data — are an extraordinary resource. But it’s\nimportant, too, to understand how people’s economic realities are playing out on the ground. Our\nCOVID-19 surveys have been instrumental in allowing us to do that.\nI’d encourage all of you to take a look at our series of surveys on our website — philadelphiafed.org —\nbut I’d like to point out just a few important data points from the latest survey, which was done this\nsummer as Delta surged.\n3\n\n\fFirst, more people were feeling more confident about their personal finances this summer than they\nwere in the spring. More were working normal hours, and more were working onsite, rather than\nremotely; 10.9 percent of respondents reported being currently laid off or furloughed, down from 17.9\npercent last fall.\nBut when it came to expectations about the future, the survey found wide disparities across groups.\nWomen, people making less than $40,000 a year, and people under the age of 36 were much more\npessimistic about their earnings over the next year than men and older people, for instance. The good\nnews is, across all survey respondents, the number of people reporting they are having trouble making\nends meet has been declining.\nThe headline of this iteration of the survey is “Cautious Optimism Reigns,” which I’d say captures my\nsentiment regarding the economy as well.\nSo, thanks again so much for having me. And now, let’s move on to questions.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon and welcome! It’s great to see so many of you at this, the Philadelphia Federal\nReserve’s 11th biennial conference on household finance and consumer payments — though this is the\nfirst we’ve held in 2D.\nWhile I’ll regret the lack of hallway conversation — honestly, some of my best ideas have come about\nquite randomly at the edges of conferences like this — it’s great that by holding this conference virtually\nwe are able to host such a widely dispersed set of participants and attendees. Though I suspect some of\nyou are regretting missing the opportunity to pad your frequent flyer account balances … which is\nsomething else I can personally attest to.\nAs the president and CEO of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, it always gives me great pride to tout the\nstellar work of our Consumer Finance Institute. But before I do that, also as president and CEO of the\nPhiladelphia Federal Reserve, there is something else I must do. That is providing the standard Fed\ndisclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nWe launched the Consumer Finance Institute — CFI to us at the Philadelphia Fed — in 2017 as a\nstrategic initiative dedicated to producing leading-edge, policy-relevant research, and events like this\none. CFI explores how credit markets and payment systems affect consumers and the economy. But\nwhile the institute itself is only 4 years old, it is built on a foundation of two decades of heavy\ninvestment in research centered on how people earn, spend, save, and invest. The Philadelphia Fed’s\ninterest in these topics is not only academic: Our goal at CFI is to develop insights that contribute to a\nhealthy consumer sector, a stable financial system, and a resilient regional and national economy.\n1\n\n\fFor us, this is personal. Philadelphia is the poorest big city in the United States.\nConferences like this one are a big part of CFI’s strategy to promote a healthier economy — and you’ll\nsoon see why. In the next two days, we’ll be learning about path-breaking research focused on timely\nsubjects such as building wealth through homeownership, consumer bankruptcy, pandemic housing\nrelief, and consumer protection and regulation. These are rich and interesting subjects for rigorous\nresearch in their own right, but they are also vitally important topics that have an impact on all\nAmericans, just about every day.\nWhen I was reviewing the conference materials, I was also struck by how much of the research\npresented at this conference will focus on the racial inequities that continue to bedevil our society. The\nresearch presented will focus, for instance, on racial disparities in bankruptcy filings and housing values,\nimportant examples of the many drivers of our nation’s yawning racial wealth gap.\nAnd this, too, is personal for us. Philadelphia is not only America’s poorest big city, it is also the nation’s\nlargest predominantly Black one.\nIn recent years, CFI researchers have documented new facts about differences in outcomes by race as it\npertains to consumers’ finances, with the ultimate goal of identifying why those disparities exist.\nWithout both — the facts and an understanding of the causal drivers — there is no way to have\nmeaningful discussions about how public policies can improve outcomes.\nIn my view, such research and debate is the right thing to do, morally — and also holds great economic\nimportance. As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve is charged with building an economy that\nmakes opportunity available to everyone and that achieves maximum employment. We can’t do that so\nlong as profound racial inequities persist for reasons we do not fully understand.\nSo just in the past year, CFI has published important new research findings, for instance, that Black,\nHispanic, and Asian mortgage borrowers were significantly more likely than White borrowers to miss\npayments due to financial distress — and significantly less likely to refinance to take advantage of the\nlarge decline in interest rates that was spurred by the Federal Reserve’s mortgage-backed security\npurchase program. We’ve also examined which groups took up mortgage forbearance at which rates,\nand what effect that had on racial disparities. The news there is somewhat more encouraging. And\nwe’ve conducted an ongoing series of surveys focused on how the pandemic has affected different\ngroups of Americans.\n\n2\n\n\fCFI scholars have also taken a historical view, examining, for example, the ongoing effects of racial\ncovenants included in housing deeds nearly a century ago. Using a series of geospatial maps, we found\nthat properties with covenants within the city of Philadelphia formed an invisible barrier to less densely\npopulated areas sought after by White residents and around predominantly White neighborhoods\nthroughout the city — and that those effects are still visible.\nThese are just a few examples of the work CFI researchers are doing every day, and I urge all of you —\nonce the conference is over — to please dig into our website at philadelphiafed.org, for much, much\nmore.\nNow, I’m well aware you’ve joined us to hear from our conference presenters rather than me, so I’ll\nleave you. But before I go, I can’t resist one more boast about the fantastic work we’re doing at the\nConsumer Finance Institute. For this conference, we received approximately 140 submissions and\nselected only eight papers to be presented. Super Bowl tickets are easier to get most years. What a\ntestament to the global recognition that CFI is receiving for its important, path-breaking work!\nSo, thank you again for joining us and please enjoy the conference.\n\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello and welcome! It’s great that so many of you have joined us for these virtual office hours. And by\nholding this event virtually, we are missing out on useful hallway conversation — not to mention some\ntasty snacks — but it’s terrific so many of you were able to join with just the click of a button.\nNow, before we proceed, I have to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Importance of Community Banks\nHere at the Fed we wear many hats: We’re a bank, a supervisor and regulator of other banks, and the\nlargest collection of economists in the world. We have the ability to lend money, to foster payments and\nsettlements, and to promote consumer protection and community development.\nWe also have the power to convene. And that is precisely our aim with this program: to facilitate faceto-face discussions with individual banks and fintech firms about responsible financial innovation. We’re\ndelighted you’re here to learn more about how innovation and technology are impacting the financial\nlandscape.\nThese meetings can be two-way learning opportunities for all participants. Banks have tremendous\nregulatory expertise, and fintech firms have deep wells of innovation expertise. But this will also be a\nlearning experience for us here at the Federal Reserve. Your insights are crucial to what we do here\nevery day — so please don’t hold back.\n\n1\n\n\fI’m particularly glad that we have so many representatives from small community banks here. While I\nprobably don’t need to belabor the importance of community banks to this particular audience, I think it\nsometimes gets lost just how central community banks are to our economy — and indeed, to American\nsociety.\nJust consider the numbers. There are more than 4,800 active community bank charters across the\ncountry. And of those, almost exactly half are in communities with fewer than 50,000 residents.\nCommunity banks — those with $10 billion or less in assets — collectively hold more than $3 trillion in\nassets. You don’t need to rewatch It’s a Wonderful Life for the hundredth time to get a sense of how\nvitally important these institutions are.\nCOVID-19 and its associated economic effects not only emphasized the importance of community banks;\nthey have also heightened the risks to the sector in a world where more and more business is conducted\nonline.\nGiven their strong relationships with local businesses, community banks were absolutely essential to\noperating the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which kept so many small businesses afloat during\nthe pandemic. According to my Fed colleague, Governor Michelle Bowman, community banks have\nmade up about 40 percent of the total value of PPP loans issued. It’s probably no exaggeration to say\nthat the PPP would have failed without community banks’ support.\nOpportunities and Challenges\nBut economic shutdowns imposed to curtail the spread of COVID-19 — particularly those that shuttered\nbank branches — also demonstrated just how important digitization is and the perils of falling behind on\nfinancial innovation and fintech.\nOnline platforms have gobbled up an increasing number of home mortgages, for instance. And one\nbanker in our area here in the Third District recently told me that because of labor shortages in his area,\nhe has been unable to reopen his bank lobbies even as the pandemic has waned. If these trends hold,\nexpect more and more use of digital solutions.\nDuring these office hours, I would encourage bankers to consider digitization opportunities for your\ninstitution and customers, as well as innovative opportunities that align with your strategic plans. And\ntomorrow, we will hear from District bankers about their experiences with fintech partnerships and\ninnovation.\n2\n\n\fThere are many opportunities, not only for serving your existing customers but also for reaching new\npopulations. Think of the creative ways fintech could be deployed to reach the under- or even\nunbanked, for instance.\nI understand, of course, that there are challenges. Smaller banks often simply don’t have the workforce\nor the cash to first research and investigate and then to ultimately invest in costly fintech platforms.\nThey lack the economies of scale that bigger banks enjoy. Set-up costs can be prohibitive. And, to be\nfrank, there are occasional cultural differences between the “move fast and break things” ethos of many\nfintech suppliers and the more risk-averse sensibilities of bankers.\nAnd those risks are real. Consider the astonishing rapidity of technological development. There are\nserious and understandable concerns: What if a year or two after making an expensive fintech\ninvestment, the technology has already become obsolete? You don’t want to be stuck with a bunch of\nbuggy whips a year after the invention of the Model T.\nAnd there can be a hesitancy to embrace new technologies on the client side, too, of course. Paper\nchecks and cash, for instance, have endured in part because people are so comfortable with them.\nIt is precisely because of these opportunities and these risks that these office hours are such a great\nopportunity for all of us. Constructive dialogue among banks, fintech firms, and the Federal Reserve will\nhelp us to listen and learn from each other.\nThe Federal Reserve, for its part, is very supportive of innovation. We’re here to convene, to support,\nand to supervise.\nWe will now hear from Bill Spaniel, head of supervision at the Philadelphia Fed, and Board of Governors\nDeputy Director Art Lindo on community bank partnerships.\nThanks again and enjoy the event.\n\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello and welcome! It’s wonderful to be here and as nice as it would be to have met in person, it’s\npretty great that we were able to do this without any jet lag. Though given how international a crowd\nwe have here today, I suspect some of you regret missing the opportunity to pad your frequent flyer\naccount balances …\nThis has been a great series of meetings so far this week, and I’m thrilled to be here with President\nBostic to discuss such a vitally important topic: rebuilding our economy sustainably and equitably. I\nreally like the framing of this conversation because you can’t have one without the other. An equitable\nrecovery will be, by its very nature, more likely to be sustainable — and vice versa.\nNow, given that you’ve already heard from several Fed presidents this week, I’m pretty sure you know\nwhat I am going to say next. Yes, once again, it’s the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\nor in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Job Deficit\nNow, another thing I’m sure you’ve heard from other Fed presidents this week is that the U.S. economy,\nby and large, is in good shape overall. GDP has come roaring back after a record contraction during the\nfirst half of 2020; consumption, housing, and manufacturing are extremely healthy; and workers’\nincomes are rising.\nBut even as GDP has almost entirely recouped its losses from last year, employment remains down\nsignificantly. We still have nearly 7.6 million fewer people working than we did before the pandemic.\n\n1\n\n\fAnd if you assume we would have maintained our prepandemic job growth of around 200,000 jobs a\nmonth had COVID-19 never arrived, we’re really down around 10.6 million jobs.\nMany millions more are in low opportunity jobs — those that pay little, don’t offer flexibility or paths to\ngrowth, or don’t take advantage of the skills they possess. Perhaps most disturbing has been a long-term\ndecline in economic mobility, with Americans born in poverty increasingly likely to stay there.\nOne of our most important responsibilities as we emerge from the pandemic — as central bankers,\npolicymakers, and simply concerned citizens — is building an equitable workforce recovery and charting\na society in which all citizens, no matter how humble the circumstances in which they are born, have a\nshot at achieving their full economic potential.\nSo, what will an equitable workforce recovery look like in practice? I’d like to sketch out a few ideas\nbefore we proceed to the discussion with President Bostic.\nBuilding an Equitable Workforce Recovery\nFor central bankers, first and foremost, an equitable workforce recovery will mean using monetary\npolicy to fulfill our dual mandate of achieving both stable prices and maximum employment. You’ll recall\nthat before the pandemic, when the job market was very robust, we were finally starting to see the kind\nof wage growth at the bottom half of the income spectrum that we’ve all been hoping for. The racial\nwage gap, which has bedeviled the United States since, frankly, before its founding, was finally starting\nto narrow as well. A robust job market, where businesses are competing for labor, will do a lot in and of\nitself to build an equitable recovery.\nBut it won’t do everything.\nThat’s why building an equitable workforce recovery will also mean getting more people into what we\ncall opportunity occupations — jobs that pay above the median wage but that don’t require a four-year\ncollege degree. We know that many Americans have the skills and talent to make these transitions\nbecause we’ve done the research to prove it.\nMy colleagues at the Philadelphia and Cleveland Feds looked at the skill sets of people who hold lowopportunity jobs that are at risk of disappearing. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay\nat least 10 percent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nThe results were incredibly encouraging: Examining 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly\n2\n\n\fhalf of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring\nsimilar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay\ndifferences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in\nsalary. For instance, bill collectors here in Philadelphia could increase their salary 45 percent, from an\naverage of about $38,000 to nearly $55,000, by becoming a credit counselor — with the added bonus\nthat people will actually want to answer the phone when you call.\nWhile the equilibrium effect will undoubtedly smooth out some of these wage differences as the labor\nforce shifts, more people being aware that their skills are transferable will no doubt improve matches\nbetween employers and employees — and boost employee bargaining power. That is to say, simply\ninforming workers that their skills are transferable — and monetizable — is an important foundation in\nan equitable workforce recovery. It should also make firms more productive, which benefits all of us in\nthe long run.\nBuilding an equitable workforce recovery also will mean that all who want to be in the labor force, can.\nAnd that especially includes mothers of young children, whose participation rates fell at the beginning of\nthe pandemic and have yet to recover. It’s no mystery why this has happened: childcare woes. Many\nparents — and let’s be frank, mothers — left the labor force to take care of their kids as schools closed\nand other options proved prohibitively expensive. And even as the pandemic has waned here in the U.S.,\nsome scarring has become apparent. Around 1.5 million mothers who were working in February 2020\nstill aren’t. At the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, we’re currently working on what we call a Research in\nAction Lab in the state of Delaware that will link several local partners, including the state’s chamber of\ncommerce, to help provide affordable childcare for families.\nAnd lastly, building an equitable workforce recovery will mean ensuring that workers have access to the\ntraining and education they need to advance in the job market. This doesn’t have to be a traditional\nfour-year degree, but we do know that at least some post-high school education is vital for career\ndevelopment in the current economy.\nThis could mean the creative use of public‒private partnerships. Here in Philadelphia, we’ve partnered\nwith local stakeholders to advance a one-of-a kind “pay for success” job training model that links\nComcast, a major employer here, with Philadelphia Works, our local publicly funded job training board.\nThe workforce board pays for training for new hires up front; the employer then reimburses the city if\ncertain benchmarks, such as staying on the job for six months, are met. This is good for both parties:\n3\n\n\fWorkers get the skills employers need, and the workforce organizations know they are training for real\njob opportunities.\nOr it could mean increased investment in microcredential courses that teach workers a marketable new\nskill in a short period of time — as brief as two months. According to a recent Georgetown University\nstudy, these can make a meaningful difference in enrollees’ careers: Certificates in engineering\ntechnologies can lead to high earnings, as do those in fields like information technology and legal\nstudies.\nOf course, even as we look for creative ways to employ short-term programs as an alternative to\ntraditional degrees, we must ensure equal opportunity to all types of degree and non-degree programs.\nWe must not allow for a two-tiered system of higher education to flourish, with low-income and\nminority students funneled into experimental programs while facing barriers to obtaining traditional\ndegrees.\nAnd that’s why building an equitable workforce recovery will also mean employing creative ways to\nfinance traditional four-year college degrees that — despite the sundry and well-known flaws of our\nhigher education system — remain one of the most dependable ladders to middle class. Income share\nagreements, for instance, where students pay back a portion of their salary after graduation in exchange\nfor borrowing less — or nothing — up front, are a potential path forward.\nColleges and universities, too, should think hard about ways to lower their own costs, such as through\nthe thoughtful use of technology to achieve economies of scale. Here, the task is truly urgent: New\nresearch from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s Consumer Finance Institute projects that our nation’s\ncolleges and universities will suffer revenue declines of between $70 billion and $115 billion over the\nnext five years, with some 80 percent of institutions nationwide suffering declines. These losses must\nnot simply be passed onto students, the magnitude of whose student debt load is already unique in the\ndeveloped world.\nConclusion\nUltimately, an equitable workforce recovery isn’t merely a “nice to have.” Nor is it exclusively a moral\nissue for our society — though it is, in my view, precisely that. It’s a necessity for building a recovery that\nwill prove durable and sustainable.\n\n4\n\n\fWe know this because highly unequal societies tend to be brittle. Their political systems are frequently\nunstable. Their periods of economic growth are often short lived and unimpressive. Ensuring an\nequitable recovery will, in the end, benefit us all.\nSo again, thank you all for joining us. And now let’s move on to the discussion.\n\n5\n\n\f"

And I sincerely mean it when I say those are\nsome tough acts — plural — to follow. So thank you all for joining us. I am truly pleased to be here with\nyou today to close things out.\nBut first, a bit of housekeeping before I proceed. That’s my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express\ntoday are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Problem\nToday’s event, the book we are releasing, and so much of the work we do every day at the Federal\nReserve is motivated by the same central insight: Declining economic mobility is one of the defining\nchallenges of our time. Indeed, not only is it an economic challenge that needs to be solved — it’s also,\nin my view, a direct challenge to our nation’s highest ideals. One of the animating creeds of our country,\nafter all, is that no person should be held back by the circumstances of their birth.\nBut far too many of people’s paths to success have been blocked. Intergenerational mobility has fallen in\nrecent decades. Income inequality has remained stubbornly high.\nThat can breed frustration; at times even complacency. It’s natural for people to feel hopeless in the\nface of monumental problems; they can feel insurmountable.\n1\n\n\fInnovative Solutions\nAnd that’s why today’s program has been so inspiring. What this program’s presentations and the\nstories we have read about in the book demonstrate so vividly is that these problems can be solved.\nWhile the case studies we highlight here are special, they are not aberrations. The ideas and tools\nthey’ve developed are practical — and in many cases, replicable. I’m an engineer by trade and a\npragmatist by education and disposition. So what I think is really great about these programs is that they\nare focused on what works.\nPart of recognizing what works is being clear-eyed about what doesn’t. The “train and pray” model,\nwhere people are trained for skills without a guaranteed job at the other end, has not historically been\nparticularly effective. Neither are training or educational opportunities that are unaffordable and thus\nunattainable to the very people who need them most. That’s crucial because we know that, to have a\ndecent shot at earning a family-sustaining wage, people need some form of post-high school training or\neducation.\nExperimentation and bold innovation are key to determining what works — and central to what we do\nat the Philadelphia Fed’s Economic Growth & Mobility Project. We believe in exploring how our research\ncan be applied to real community problems.\nThat’s why a couple of years ago we partnered with stakeholders in Philadelphia to advance a one-of-akind “pay for success” job training model that links Comcast, a major employer here, with Philadelphia\nWorks, our local publicly funded job training board.\nWhile the program is still in its early stages, the lessons from the model can be applied to partnerships\nbetween employers and training organizations across the country. The way it works is that the\nworkforce board, Philadelphia Works, pays for training for new hires up front; the employer then\nreimburses the board if certain benchmarks, such as staying on the job for six months, are met.\nThis is good for both parties: Workers get the skills the employers need, and the workforce\norganizations know they are training for real job opportunities. You can read more about this exciting\nand important model in the book.\nThe exciting truth is that there are innovative and important programs taking shape all over the country.\nThe book describes many of them, like Career Impact Bond programs that enable workers to upskill\naffordably, as well as the groundbreaking higher-ed initiatives in Texas and Virginia that link payment for\n2\n\n\fprograms to student employment and income after graduation. What these programs have in common\nis they often represent a mindset shift — away from old models and toward planning around outcomes,\nbuilding flexibility into contracts, sharing risk, and paying proportionate to impact.\nNow, we certainly know that a book won’t do all those things on its own. This book is instead a jumpingoff point: a way to highlight an emerging set of principles that define a more nimble training ecosystem\nthat works better for all workers and that truly charts a way to an equitable workforce recovery.\nAnd the task is truly urgent. Despite the improving economy, we still have 8 million fewer jobs than we\ndid prior to the pandemic — closer to 11 million, if you assume we would have been creating around\n200,000 jobs a month without the pandemic. Tens of millions more are stuck in jobs with only limited\nopportunities. Now is the moment for bold action.\nThe Work Ahead\nIn the coming months, we will be convening and supporting local communities through a spotlight series\nto bring ideas from the book to their situations. If one of the case studies in the book speaks to you —\nand if you think you could assemble a local team to help adapt that idea and test it — we want to help.\nThe plan is still evolving, but the team behind Workforce Realigned, along with our partners, will support\nyour team with technical assistance, relevant nationwide expertise, and connections with others\npursuing similar initiatives. If you want to learn more, check out our webpage for information at\nworkforcerealigned.org. We really want to hear from you.\nSo, thank you again for joining us today. Now let’s go out there and make it happen.\n\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fThe Economy, Inflation, and Forbearance\nWomen in Housing and Finance Public Policy Luncheon\nWashington, D.C. (Virtual)\n\nJune 2, 2021\n\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon! Thank you so much for that introduction. It’s great to be here with this group — and as\nmuch as I’d like to have been there in person, it’s pretty great that I didn’t have to fight the traffic on\nI-95. I’m really looking forward to our discussion today.\nMy plan is to talk about where we are economically and then to share some of the Philadelphia Fed’s\nresearch on housing that I think will be of particular interest to this group. Then we can open things up\nfor a Q&A.\nBut before we do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee\nor in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic Outlook\nMaybe it’s the summer weather or the fact that the Phillies are a couple of games ahead of the\nNationals in the NL East, but I’m pleased to note that there is a palpable sense of optimism as we\nconvene. (Just kidding about the Nats part!)\nCOVID-19 cases have fallen to levels not seen since the onset of the pandemic. Deaths are finally\nretreating as well. After a truly painful 2020 and early part of 2021, things do seem to be turning around.\n\n1\n\n\fThroughout the pandemic, the economy has largely tracked the path of the virus. And so as COVID-19\nhas receded, the economy has picked up. Employment, housing, and manufacturing figures came in\nstronger over the last couple of months than many of us — myself included — expected.\nAnd recent spending data have once again provided a reminder to never bet against the American\nconsumer. Over the past three months, consumer spending — a component of GDP comprising around\n70 percent of the nation’s total economic output — has grown a healthy 2.7 percent.\nWe’re digging out of a very deep hole — and we have a long way to go — but for now, I’m anticipating\nnational GDP growth to come in around 7 percent for 2021, before moderating to 3 percent growth next\nyear.\nThere are, of course, downside risks, including vaccination hesitancy that precludes true herd immunity\nas well as the possibility of new COVID-19 variants that render the vaccines less effective. As\nencouraging as these trends are, the pandemic is not yet over.\nThere is no doubt that the cash Congress appropriated to Americans through the Paycheck Protection\nProgram and the more than $3,000 in direct payments to the majority of U.S. households has helped\nbuoy consumer spending during the pandemic.\nIn some cases, that meant literal cash — one of our contacts who owns a network of gas stations and\nconvenience stores reported needing extra armored car runs during the week that the latest round of\nstimulus checks arrived to keep up with demand at his ATMs. Here at the Fed, we’re also starting, once\nagain, to deal with increased demand for coins. So I hope there aren’t too many of you who need\nquarters to do your laundry; it could be challenging for a while to find them …\nOther Americans have socked away what they’ve received. The household savings rate is up sharply, and\nin March, it was at the second-highest rate on record — 27.7 percent. And others are paying down debt\nat a rapid clip; bankers have told us that there are clearly some who are struggling with loans and\nforbearance, but that many of their clients are using this period to catch up on payments they may have\nfallen behind on.\nAll of this is setting the table for a recovery that could be long and durable.\nNow, it’s very important to note that the recovery in GDP has so far outpaced the rebound in the labor\nforce.\n\n2\n\n\fThe level of employment is still more than 8 million below the prepandemic peak, and that doesn’t\naccount for the roughly 200,000 in monthly gains we probably would have seen without COVID-19. So in\na sense, we’re really down around 11 million jobs.\nAs the economy continues to reopen, I expect job creation to pick up in the coming months. Given\ncurrent trajectories, I anticipate the labor force returning to its prepandemic trend sometime next\nsummer — it will be a while, in other words.\nThere are myriad reasons that the employment rebound is slightly lagging other indicators.\nSome are salutary: During the pandemic, firms became more productive and learned to do more with\nless. A more productive economy benefits all of us in the long run.\nBut what’s puzzling at first glance is that the number of job openings is actually very high. We’ve all seen\nthe Help Wanted signs popping up just about everywhere. And I was just down at the Jersey Shore and\nhad a chance to chat with the manager of a local grocery store. She told me she’s having a hard time\nfinding anybody to work this summer.\nWhat accounts for this? We’ve heard from many employers who say that enhanced unemployment\nbenefits are keeping workers at home. If that’s truly a determinative factor, it will be short lived; the\nextra benefits expire in September.\nOther people may have some hesitancy about returning to the workplace until they get vaccinated and\nuntil they’re convinced their coworkers are vaccinated. In my District, I know that many people who\ncommute by mass transit are hesitant about getting back on the bus or train.\nAnd another factor that has driven far too many talented people out of the workforce during the\npandemic is a dearth of childcare options.\nThere is a real economic cost that all of us incur when people — and let’s be frank, mostly mothers —\nleave the labor force because they can’t find an affordable option for taking care of their kids during the\nworkday.\nIn Delaware, for instance, it now costs the median-earning family 20 percent of their income to pay for\nthe care of a child under 5 years old. That’s a heavy burden — even before COVID-19 shuttered many\nschools and childcare centers, further straining families.\n\n3\n\n\fMaking childcare more affordable is a complex issue but one that surely requires our attention. Already,\none of the most oft-cited reasons couples give for having fewer children than they say they want is the\ncost of raising them.\nMy colleagues at the Minneapolis Fed have found that, at the outset of the pandemic, many parents of\nyoung children left the labor force — 3.4 percent of fathers and 2.9 percent of mothers dropped out\naltogether. But in the ensuing year, most fathers have returned to the labor force, while the\nparticipation rate of mothers of young children is still down 2.8 percentage points from before the\npandemic. That is a lot of human capital lying untapped.\nInflation and Fed Policy\nWith the economy picking up and so much fiscal support and monetary accommodation, there is some\nupside risk to increased inflation. We will continue to monitor that closely. But for now, I’m forecasting\nclose to 3 percent headline inflation for 2021.\nAt the Fed, we’re planning to keep the federal funds rate low for long, but it may be time to at least\nthink about thinking about tapering our $120 billion in monthly Treasury bond and mortgage-backed\nsecurities purchases. This is not something we are going to do suddenly, though. We need to follow the\nplaybook we had after the Great Recession; that is, start to taper the bond purchases slowly. We will\nremove accommodation carefully and methodically as the economy continues to strengthen.\nIt may not make for exciting speeches, but our goal here is to be boring.\nResearch on Forbearance\nNow, before we move to the Q&A, I would like to share some research from my colleagues at the\nPhiladelphia Fed.\nI’m reminded of the old Saturday Night Live joke about Rhode Island — neither a road nor an island —\nand I know that not everybody in this group is a woman who works in housing or finance. But I’m sure\nyou’ll find it interesting and important.\nMy colleagues in Philadelphia wanted to get to the bottom of two important questions as we assess and\nseek to remedy the damage wrought by the pandemic.\n\n4\n\n\fFirst: What is the extent of racial and income disparities among mortgage borrowers in nonpayment on\ntheir mortgages, and how has the pandemic affected these disparities? Then, they wanted to find out\nwho took up forbearance on their mortgages and who missed this important opportunity.\nBecause the CARES Act mandates that borrowers in forbearance who aren’t paying on their mortgages\nstill be reported to credit bureaus as if they are paying, these turned out to be surprisingly tricky\nquestions to answer. But through some quite clever methods — my Philadelphia Fed colleagues are\nnothing if not ingenious — the researchers were able to suss out the data.\nHere is what they found: Between April and November 2020, minorities’ and lower-income borrowers’\nnonpayment rates were twice as high as for higher-income and White borrowers.\nEven if we compare borrowers with the same credit score and the same loan type, Black and Hispanic\nborrowers have more than 30 percent higher rates of nonpayment, and lower-income borrowers 50\npercent higher. Moreover, and importantly, these disparities largely did not exist pre-COVID-19.\nIn a sign that the CARES Act was effective, my colleagues found that minority and lower-income\nborrowers took up forbearances at significantly higher rates than other groups.\nThe rub, of course, is that under the CARES Act and subsequent extension from the Biden\nadministration, forbearance lasts only up to 18 months, meaning many borrowers will be coming off\nsoon. That’s concerning, given that as of mid-May, about 35 percent of people who went into\nforbearance in the first place are still in it — an estimated 2.2 million borrowers.\nThat presents a challenge to borrowers first and foremost, of course. But also to lenders. And my\ncolleagues suggest a possible solution to this problem.\nThe proposed fix would extend the term of the loan and reduce interest payments, for paymentreduction modifications of 20 or 30 percent in total for those who have a high payment burden and little\nequity in their house. In the case of a 20 percent reduction, these modifications would cost lenders\nabout $1.5 billion. For 30 percent reductions, the cost would be $4.3 billion.\nThe upshot? Only a fraction of the costs of broader government-assistance programs enacted in 2020\nand 2021 could keep distressed borrowers in their homes. That strikes me as something worth thinking\nhard about.\nSo, thank you again for having me, and now I’m happy to take some questions.\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon and welcome! It’s an honor to be here at this, the Federal Reserve’s sixth virtual session\non racism and the economy. This series, sponsored by all 12 Reserve Banks, examines the economic\nimpact of structural racism and advances bold ideas and concrete actions to achieve an economy that\nmakes opportunity available to everyone and that achieves maximum employment. I’m thrilled to be\nhere and delighted that we have such a robust turnout — an indication of how urgent this issue is.\nBut before we begin, I have to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nThe tragic events of last year threw our country’s tortured relationship with racism into stark relief. The\nCOVID-19 crisis, in both its health and economic effects, disproportionately impacted people and\ncommunities of color. And the death of George Floyd spurred civil unrest that illuminated the structural\nracism that remains stubbornly pervasive in our society.\nBut even though last year’s events brought structural racism to the forefront of the country’s\nconsciousness, they were hardly novel. They were instead part of a long and painful history that has\nindelibly stained American history.\n\n1\n\nNote: This speech was prerecorded for the Racism and the Economy: Focus on Entrepreneurship event.\n\n1\n\n\fIndeed, we are convening one day after the 100-year anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, an act of\nracial terrorism in which a White mob destroyed a thriving Black neighborhood — “the Black Wall\nStreet” — in that Oklahoma city.\nIn addition to the lives lost, the Tulsa massacre destroyed scores of small businesses, which are the\nfocus of today’s vitally important session. Entrepreneurship and small business ownership provide\nopportunities for Americans to generate wealth and build thriving communities. They are also an\nessential plank in building an equitable workforce recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and an\neconomy that works for all Americans.\nSmall businesses are drivers of job growth. As of 2018, there were more than 30 million American small\nbusinesses, meaning they employ fewer than 500 people. Those small businesses collectively employ\nnearly 60 million people or about half of the country’s private workforce.\nAnd crucially, small businesses can be an engine for building a more racially equitable economy: More\nthan 8 million small businesses are owned by racial minorities. Here in Philadelphia, we are particularly\nsensitive to the concerns of these vital businesses. In Philadelphia — the nation’s largest predominantly\nBlack city — fully 99.7 percent of businesses are small businesses.\nBut let’s be honest. These statistics, impressive as they are, belie the very real structural barriers that\nstymie entrepreneurship among racial and ethnic minorities. For instance, despite its large African\nAmerican population, only 6 percent of small businesses here in Philadelphia are helmed by Black\nowners and that includes sole proprietorships.\nOne real problem is a lack of banking relationships. This became painfully obvious during the\nadministration of the CARES Act’s PPP loans, which were largely funneled through preexisting\nrelationships between lenders and business owners. PPP loans have been a vital lifeline for small\nbusinesses during the pandemic as local governments shuttered businesses and consumers stayed\nhome.\nBut they weren’t distributed equitably. In fact, not even close.\nAccording to data submitted by applicants to the Small Business Administration, which managed the\nprogram, during the height of the pandemic, fully 83 percent of PPP loans went to businesses owned by\nWhite entrepreneurs. Black business owners, by contrast, received only 1.9 percent of the loans issued.\nA separate study found that, not only did Black business owners apply for PPP loans at a lower rate than\n2\n\n\fother groups, their applications were also turned down at higher rates — even when controlling for\nrevenue and credit.\nIt’s clear that profound structural barriers are limiting minority entrepreneurs from accessing capital.\nAll too often shut out from traditional lenders offering favorable rates, Black business owners are forced\nto turn to predatory lenders. That means that money that could be spent on buying goods and services,\nrenting storefronts, or hiring workers goes toward interest payments. And the entire economy suffers\nfor it.\nThere are exciting and important efforts afoot to redress these disparities, which is one of the reasons\ntoday’s session is so important. CDFIs, for instance, are a crucial tool for channeling capital into minority\ncommunities. And new venture capital funds that focus specifically on minority-owned businesses are\nanother exciting development.\nBut piecemeal efforts cannot — and will not — be the entire solution to this problem.\nIt will take all of us — state and local governments, the banking community, and, yes, the Federal\nReserve — to break down these barriers and build an equitable and durable economic recovery.\nFor our part, at the Philadelphia Fed, we are launching our 2021 Reinventing Our Communities cohort\nprogram, in which community cohorts in nine cities across the country will work together to frame,\ncontextualize, and organize in order to spark an equitable small business recovery and to strengthen\nsupport for small business owners of color.\nOur hope is that through peer learning the Fed will provide communities with the tools to identify\nstructural racism and then create a plan to address it tailored to where they are.\nNow, you’re about to hear from a series of speakers who will illuminate racism’s effect on minority\nentrepreneurs — and this is crucial — on how we can work creatively and urgently to disrupt the status\nquo.\nDr. Robert E. Weems Jr., a distinguished professor of business history at Wichita State University and our\nkeynote speaker, will share his insights on impediments to minority small business owners and solutions\nto overcome them.\nOur disrupters panel, featuring three dynamic leaders, will pitch and interrogate radical solutions for\naddressing racism in entrepreneurship.\n3\n\n\fAnd then we’ll hear from three entrepreneur/activists, who will reflect on the solutions discussed and\nthe implications for their real-life experiences as businesspeople.\nFinally, you’ll hear reflections from my colleagues, the Reserve Bank presidents from Dallas, Chicago,\nand Atlanta, to reflect on what we heard today.\nI’m really excited about today’s program.\nSo, again, thank you for joining us today. And now, let me turn things over to my Fed colleague Neel\nKashkari who will introduce Dr. Weems. Neel?\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nOpening Keynote\nGood morning! It’s great to be here. And a special thanks to our staff at the Philadelphia Fed who\norganized this symposium, our distinguished panelists, and, of course, all of you for taking the time to\njoin us.\nAs a recovering academic, I’m particularly excited about today’s program. The future of higher ed is\nobviously of personal importance to me … but it’s not just that. It’s also crucial to the future of our\ncountry. We’ve assembled a terrific assortment of panelists today, who will — I am sure — provide\nunparalleled insight into the challenges and opportunities facing the sector. How lucky we all are to be\nhere … in some form.\nBut now, before we begin, I have to say something I never needed to say in my lecture hall days. That’s\nwhat we call the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nHigher Ed’s Economic Footprint\nThe Philadelphia Fed has invested significantly in research in higher education and education finance\nover the past couple of decades. Our interdisciplinary, applied research group, the Consumer Finance\nInstitute, which is sponsoring this event, is just the most recent strategic initiative in this area.\n\n1\n\n\fOur Bank’s strong interest in the subject is partly geographic. Now, some may like to call the Boston area\nthe “Athens of America,” but here in Philadelphia, we are at least Alexandria. Some 80 colleges and\nuniversities populate the Greater Philadelphia area. The two largest employers in the region are\nuniversities and their associated health systems — the University of Pennsylvania and Thomas Jefferson\nUniversity. These anchor institutions — comprising both eds and meds — are of vital economic\nimportance to the District we serve at the Philadelphia Fed.\nBut that does not make us unique — far from it, in fact. And for all its civic virtues, higher education is\nalso an industry whose economic effects are felt coast to coast.\nIndeed, in the fall of 2019, there were approximately 4,000 postsecondary educational institutions in the\nU.S., counting both four-year and two-year institutions and nonprofits as well as for-profits.\nTheir economic impact is, quite obviously, sizable. The National Center for Education Statistics counts\nmore than 4 million people employed in higher education. Those employed in the higher education\nsector earn higher-than-median wages.\nNor can we forget the students and the value they bring to the communities where they study and\nsocialize. As of last fall, 19.7 million students were enrolled in America’s colleges and universities, 12\nmillion of whom were attending full-time. Right around now, as the academic year draws to a close,\ncolleges and universities are getting ready to confer 1,988,000 bachelor’s degrees, 983,000 associate’s\ndegrees, 833,000 master’s degrees, and 187,000 doctorates. That’s a whole lot of people entering the\nworkforce better prepared than they were before.\nAnd then there are the millions of Americans whose livelihood depends indirectly on higher education.\nThink of the restaurants, coffee shops — and, let’s be honest, grungy bars — that cluster near campuses,\nas well as the legions of suppliers of books, accommodations, transportation, furniture, utilities,\ntechnology services, and so much more, that depend on colleges and universities. There’s a reason the\nnotion of the “college town” evokes thriving small businesses and vibrant communities. Colleges and\nuniversities have a serious multiplier effect.\nAll of which is to say, the economic impact of the higher education sector is felt by far more than the\nalready massive numbers of people who are employed or enrolled in it. The entire country is touched by\nit.\n\n2\n\n\fFurthermore, for all its problems — many of which we will delve into today — higher education, in all its\nforms, remains a critical rung on the ladder to the middle class in this country.\nA bachelor’s degree is worth $2.8 million on average in career earnings, according to Georgetown\nUniversity’s Center on Education and the Workforce. Bachelor’s degree holders earn 31 percent more\nthan those with an associate’s degree and 84 percent more than those with a high school diploma.\nMoreover, this so-called college premium has risen in recent decades. In 1999, bachelor’s degree\nholders earned just 75 percent more than those with a high school diploma. The earnings gap between\nthose with degrees and those without is only rising.\nAnd that is precisely why today’s symposium on the financial viability of the higher education industry is\nso important. The financial health and stability of these institutions is of the greatest import not just to\neducators and students, but to all of us.\nI can’t wait to hear from our panels of state education leaders, researchers, and college and university\npresidents. I only wish we could be serving lunch. And I’ll be back later to speak more on today’s topic\nand open up the Q&A.\nSo again, thanks so much for joining us and a warm welcome on behalf of the Philadelphia Fed. And\nnow, I’d like to turn things over to Rajeev Darolia of the University of Kentucky, who will lead our first\npanel.\n---------------------------\n\n3\n\n\fClosing Keynote\nHello again! What a great program this has been. I want to say thank you, again, to the organizers of this\nsymposium, the panelists, and all of you for joining us.\nAlso, I’m not sure if I want to say this, but I know I have to. It’s a rerun of what I said this morning: The\nviews I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nToday’s presentations have underlined two fundamental facts about the higher education sector that\nindicate why we are approaching a crisis point. One: Higher education is, as I sketched out a bit this\nmorning, deeply important to the civic and economic life of our country. And two: That very system is in\nperil.\nTrends Before the Pandemic\nEven before the pandemic, long-standing secular trends were threatening the industry. One was the\never-increasing cost of a college education, whose persistent rise in tuition and fees has been outpacing\ninflation for decades. Low productivity growth has been a primary driver of this phenomenon.\nClosely related has been the explosion of student debt. The more expensive education has become —\nand the less support the public sector has offered to students — the more they have had to borrow to\nfinance their education. Americans now owe more than $1.7 trillion in student loans, far outpacing\ncredit card debt and second only to mortgages in total borrowing.\nDemographics threaten the industry, too. The traditional college-age segment is actually in decline.\nThose enrolled in higher education institutions now tend to be older and have lower incomes than\nbefore. It’s something to marvel at: College education has become more expensive at a time when the\ncustomer base has become less able to afford it.\nTechnological advances, meanwhile, have brought forth increased competition to the traditional higher\ned sector. Low-cost, easily accessible online education represents a severe threat to an industry with\nhigh fixed costs. This is especially worrisome when, as we heard from one of our panelists today, the\nquality of online education as a complete substitute for in-person learning remains questionable.\n\n4\n\n\fThere were bright spots like health care. As the country ages and medical technology advances,\nuniversities with medical campuses attached have prospered. But for the most part, the trends were\ngrim.\nThe COVID-19 Effect\nAnd as we’ve learned today, COVID-19 has only served to strengthen those forces that are threatening\nthe higher education industry as we know it. Cost pressures are intensifying at campuses from coast to\ncoast. Online distance learning brought on by the pandemic may have only served to further undermine\nthe value proposition of expensive traditional institutions. And unlike in prior downturns, enrollment at\ncommunity colleges has actually fallen during the pandemic as people have had to juggle family and job\nresponsibilities under unprecedented strain.\nMore pain is, unfortunately, almost certainly on the way. My colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed, using\nhistorical data on how states responded to previous economic downturns and contemporaneous\nmeasures of the severity of the pandemic and its economic effects, have projected revenue shortfalls of\nbetween $70 billion and $115 billion over the coming five-year period across the sector. Our researchers\nforecast that 80 percent of all institutions will face revenue shortfalls, with HBCUs, public colleges, and\ninstitutions with fewer than 1,000 students facing the heaviest fiscal burdens.\nThe truth is, far from being the “unkindest cut,” state governments have shown little hesitance to cut\nspending on higher education. Nor are the cuts precisely aligned with revenue declines. To take a\nhypothetical situation: A fall of 10 percent in tax revenues could lead to a 15 percent slash in higher\neducation spending, for instance. Unlike K‒12 education or roads and bridges, higher ed makes an easy\ntarget.\nI recall vividly learning this firsthand when I was president of the University of Delaware (UD). A\npowerful state legislator had called me into this office in Dover to let me know our appropriation would\nbe slashed even though that would mean, by necessity, a hike in tuition. A little later on that same day, I\nsat in a public hearing while that very same legislator attacked me for … raising tuition.\nSo there’s your poli-sci lesson for the day.\n\n5\n\n\fA Call for Action\nAs we emerge from this pandemic, I want to call on federal and state governments — and American\nsociety — to recommit to public postsecondary education, which remains the indispensable tool for\neconomic and social mobility and to educating our citizenry. Higher education is, as I stated earlier, an\nindustry. But it is also a public good.\nI am not — and I stress not — calling for blank checks. Colleges and universities need to meet the public\nsector halfway. They must urgently bend the cost curve. For society to recommit to them, it is\nincumbent on them to change.\nI also want to stress that this commitment must extend beyond traditional four-year colleges — and\ntheir football programs. Many state legislators seem more concerned with sports than anything else in\neducation.\nThe country should be investing in the totality of post-high school training and education.\nNew Models\nIndeed, there are now many exciting alternatives to traditional four-year colleges or even community\ncolleges. Coming from a former university president, this probably sounds like Ronald McDonald\nadmonishing you to lay off the french fries. But the truth is that many Americans don’t need a\ntraditional four-year college degree to enjoy a prosperous life. What they need are the skills that will\npropel them into middle-class jobs. For my dad, my uncles, and my brother, that was pipefitting. And for\nmany, that’s still a great option. For others, it will be something else.\nMany skills today are gained through a variety of short-term programs that do not lead to degrees but\ncan provide marketable new skills. These courses can be as short as two months, and workers — many\nof whom are in their midcareer and are looking to retool, stand to benefit. (The quality of these\nprograms can vary widely, however.)\nAccording to a recent Georgetown University study, these can make a meaningful difference in\nenrollees’ careers: Certificates in engineering technologies can lead to high earnings, as do those in\nfields like information technology and legal studies. Indeed, the study found some certificates can yield\nearnings that rival those of bachelor’s degrees in other fields. My electrician happens to live in my\nneighborhood, and he owns his own business and makes a great living without a four-year degree.\n\n6\n\n\fShort-term credentials can be gained in many venues, from traditional community colleges, to private\nacademies like computer-coding boot camps. The training can be done both online and at brick-andmortar institutions.\nOf course, even as we look for creative ways to employ short-term programs as an alternative to\ntraditional degrees, we must ensure equal opportunity to all types of degree and non-degree programs.\nWe must not allow for a two-tiered system of higher education to flourish, with low income and\nminority students funneled into experimental programs while facing barriers to obtaining traditional\ndegrees. There are also public‒private partnerships designed to provide pipelines of talent to the private\nsector. The way the latter works is that companies essentially outsource a portion of their employee\ntraining to outside vendors, using a “pay for success” model. That means the company reimburses the\nentity that paid for the training in the first place — say, the local publicly funded job board — if the new\nhire hits certain benchmarks, like staying on the job for six months. It can be an effective way to entice\ncorporations to hire from populations they may find too risky or for which they lack sufficient familiarity,\nparticularly those in underserved communities. The workers will benefit, of course, but so will the\ncompanies that will have access to an undertapped pool of talent.\nFour-Year Schools\nFor many others, a four-year degree is still going to be the best option. But these institutions require a\nradical overhaul.\nBegin by asking: What value proposition do universities offer? Fundamentally, they are offering\nsomething quite profound. Rather than a certain set of skills or a discrete body of facts, universities\ninstead are pitching the promise of critical skills to learn how to learn for a lifetime.\nA few years ago, I authored a paper examining the systems that universities use to deliver this\neducation.\nOn most campuses, I recounted, classes are scheduled three days a week for an hour each day, twice a\nweek for one-and-a-half hours, or once a week in three-hour blocks. Room assignments are optimized to\nfit these scheduled slots, and classes are scheduled to meet student demand — although often class\ntimes are more likely to reflect faculty preference. Classrooms are designed to meet the schedule, which\nin turn is derived from optimizing the use of classrooms.\n\n7\n\n\fIn sum, the entire system on a college campus is designed to optimize teaching, where teaching is\ndefined as being in a classroom, for example, twice a week for one-and-a-half hours at a time. Over the\ndecades, we have built optimized teaching factories.\nBut what if, I asked, rather than design teaching factories, universities instead focused on creating\nlearning-centric institutions? Institutions that are efficient — and by definition — affordable.\nIt could mean replacing vestigial general education requirements — which are too often in place to\nprotect privileged fiefdoms in various academic departments — with intelligently designed common\ncore programs like those in place at some of our country’s most prestigious universities and colleges.\nIt could mean the selective and intelligent use of technology to achieve economies of scale as Arizona\nState University, Georgia Tech, and others are doing with quite impressive results. But universities must\nkeep in mind that online education is a means, not an end in and of itself.\nIt could mean mergers and acquisitions. Here in Philadelphia, Saint Joseph’s University and the\nUniversity of the Sciences are proposing to merge, a move that will promote efficiency and bolster the\ncombined schools’ presence in health sciences, a major growth industry.\nIt could mean rethinking the structure of university faculty and contemplating, rather than simply\nloading up on teachers’ assistants, the use of full-time nontenured faculty to reduce labor costs.\nThe health-care industry is an interesting example: It has successfully reduced costs using nurse\npractitioners in the place of physicians for many routine tasks. It has also embraced telemedicine,\nparticularly during the pandemic.\nIt could — and should — mean all of the above, and much more that I haven’t even contemplated,\nbecause time is of the essence and the pressures are very real and only set to worsen.\nThere are also great opportunities to more closely integrate four-year and community colleges in ways\nthat promote efficiency and better serve students. Everyone in higher education knows that far too\nmany students, through no fault of their own, enter demanding institutions without adequate\npreparation.\nMany of these students have unfortunately attended high schools that left them ill prepared for collegelevel work or have had life challenges that have left them unprepared for the demands of a selective\n\n8\n\n\fcollege or university. That can be disastrous, because once a student falls behind academically, it’s very,\nvery difficult to catch up.\nAt UD, the Associate in Arts Program not only provides a pipeline of students into the university, but it\nalso makes sure they are poised to succeed once they get there.\nThe way the Associate in Arts Program works is this: UD courses are taught by UD faculty in small classes\nin Delaware Tech buildings throughout the state. (Delaware Tech is the state’s public community\ncollege.)\nStudents receive an associate’s degree in University Studies by earning credits in the core courses that\nare required of all undergraduates, and then, they transition to UD’s main campus to earn their\nbachelor’s degree. Most full-time students receive money from the state to cover their tuition,\ndemonstrating the potential for meaningful state support for well-designed programs. The program is\nhigh touch, with small class sizes and lots of interaction between faculty and students.\nI’m thrilled to report that 64 percent of students in the program graduate with their associate’s degree\nwithin three years — well above the national average of around 33 percent. Of those, 88 percent go\nonto the main campus at UD, and nearly 80 percent of those graduate with a bachelor’s degree.\nBecause the program is taught by UD faculty, the transition from an associate’s to bachelor’s degree\nbecomes something approaching seamless. A member of the English faculty who is teaching in the\nAssociate in Arts Program knows exactly what her students are prepared for once they enter an English\ncourse on the main campus.\nWhy We Learn\nYou know, a long time ago, when people used to ask me what they should study, I would tell them to\nfollow their passion. I realize now that this was precisely the wrong answer.\nNow I say, pick a subject you find really difficult. And study that.\nBecause ultimately, the purpose of education is not simply to learn what you need to know, but more\nfundamentally how to think. That’s just as true for somebody earning an electrical engineering\ncertificate as it is for another person pursuing a philosophy doctorate.\n\n9\n\n\fIt’s also true for me: I benefited from a great education in engineering and economics at the University\nof Pennsylvania, and now I’m a central banker, formulating monetary policy. My education didn’t just\nteach me how to build roads and bridges, it taught me how to reason.\nA society where people know how to reason — how to think — strikes me as one that is bound to be a\nsuccessful one. Higher education’s value is not just the economic boost it provides to our country,\nthough that is incredibly important. Its value also lies in teaching our fellow Americans how to think.\nSo again, thank you everyone for being here today. And now I’m happy to take a few questions.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fThe Economic Recovery Continues\nCFA Society Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA (Virtual)\n\nMay 11, 2021\n\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon! It’s great to be back with this group. I’m really looking forward to our discussion today\n— especially the Q&A portion. And given that you’re an audience of CFAs, I’ve come expecting some\nreally tough, forensic questions, such as … what on Earth is going on with the Phillies?\nToday I’d like to offer you a few thoughts on where we are economically. I also plan to talk a bit about\nhow we can build a more equitable and sustainable economy as we recover from the pandemic.\nBut before we do that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic Outlook\nSetting the Phillies aside, I’m pleased to note that there is a palpable sense of optimism as we convene.\nLast year and the early part of 2021 were really, really tough — and tragic for millions of Americans —\nbut things have noticeably begun to turn around in our area and across the country.\nEconomic data like employment, housing, and manufacturing figures came in stronger over the last\ncouple of months than many of us — myself included — expected. And recent spending data have once\nagain provided a reminder to never bet against the American consumer. In March alone, consumer\nspending — a component of GDP comprising around 70 percent of the nation’s total economic output —\nsurged 4.2 percent.\n1\n\n\fWe can credit increased vaccinations, falling COVID-19 case rates, and a huge dose of fiscal stimulus for\nthe reviving national economy. We’re digging out of a very deep hole — and we have a long way to go\n— but for now, I’m anticipating national GDP growth to come in around 7 percent for 2021, before\nmoderating to 3 percent growth next year.\nThere are, of course, downside risks, including vaccination hesitancy that precludes true herd immunity\nas well as the possibility of new COVID-19 variants that render the vaccines less efficacious. The tragic\nsituation in India is a reminder that even as the situation in the U.S. improves, much of the world is still\nin the worst throes of the pandemic.\nCloser to home, there is no doubt that the cash Congress appropriated to Americans through the\nPaycheck Protection Program and the more than $3,000 in direct payments to the majority of U.S.\nhouseholds has helped buoy consumer spending during the pandemic.\nIn some cases, that meant literal cash — one of our contacts who owns a network of gas stations and\nconvenience stores reported needing extra armored car runs during the week the latest round of\nstimulus checks arrived to keep up with demand at his ATMs. Here at the Fed, we’re also starting, once\nagain, to deal with increased demand for coins. So I hope there aren’t too many of you who need\nquarters to do your laundry; it could be challenging for a while to find them …\nOther Americans have squirreled away what they’ve received. The household savings rate is up sharply,\nand in March, it was at the second-highest rate on record — 27.6 percent. And others are paying down\ndebt at a rapid clip; bankers have told us that there are clearly some who are struggling with loans and\nforbearance, but that many of their clients are using this period to catch up on payments they may have\nfallen behind on.\nAll of this is setting the table for a recovery that could be long and durable.\nThe Labor Force Recovery\nIt’s important to note that the recovery in GDP has so far outpaced the rebound in the labor force. The\nlevel of employment is still more than 8 million below the prepandemic peak, and that doesn’t account\nfor the roughly 200,000 in monthly gains we probably would have seen without COVID-19. April’s jobs\nreport, which came in at only 266,000 new jobs, was extremely disappointing.\n\n2\n\n\fGiven that the underlying fundamentals of the economy look so strong, April’s numbers were probably\nan outlier, however, and I expect job creation to pick up in the coming months. At this point, I anticipate\nthe labor force returning to its prepandemic trend sometime next summer.\nThere are myriad reasons that the employment rebound is slightly lagging other indicators. Some are\nsalutary: During the pandemic, firms became more productive and learned to do more with less. A more\nproductive economy benefits all of us in the long run.\nBut other people may have some hesitancy about returning to the workplace until they get vaccinated,\nand they’re convinced their coworkers are vaccinated. There’s also great inconsistency across industries;\nin the service sector, hospitality and tourism jobs are still down significantly because their business has\nyet to return in significant numbers.\nAnother factor that has driven far too many talented people out of the workforce is a dearth of childcare\noptions.\nThere is a real economic cost that all of us incur when people — and let’s be frank, mostly mothers —\nleave the labor force because they can’t find an affordable option for taking care of their kids during the\nworkday.\nLike quality education, affordable childcare is not merely a “nice to have” — it’s an economic necessity.\nIn Delaware, for instance, it now costs the median-earning family 20 percent of their income to pay for\nthe care of a child under 5 years old. That’s a heavy burden — even before COVID-19 shuttered many\nschools and childcare centers, further straining families.\nMaking childcare more affordable is a complex issue but one that surely requires our attention. Already,\none of the most oft-cited reasons couples give for having fewer children than they say they want is the\ncost of raising them.\nMy colleagues at the Minneapolis Fed have found that, at the outset of the pandemic, many parents of\nyoung children left the labor force — 3.4 percent of fathers and 2.9 percent of mothers dropped out\naltogether. But in the ensuing year, most fathers have returned to the labor force, while the\nparticipation rate of mothers of young children is still down 2.8 percentage points from before the\npandemic. That is a lot of human capital lying untapped. The Philadelphia Fed, in partnership with the\nDelaware Chamber of Commerce, is piloting a Research in Action Lab focused on providing childcare\noptions precisely because of this issue.\n3\n\n\fFor now, Fed policy is going to hold steady.\nWe’ll keep the federal funds rate very low and continue making more than $100 billion in monthly\nTreasury bond and mortgage-backed securities purchases. While the economic situation is improving,\nrecovery is still a work in progress, and there’s no reason to withdraw support yet.\nWith so much fiscal support and monetary accommodation, there is some upside risk to increased\ninflation, and we will continue to monitor that closely. But for now, I’m forecasting 2.3 percent headline\ninflation for 2021 with core inflation at 2 percent.\nThe Occupational Mobility Explorer\nLastly, before we move to the Q&A, I’d like to take a moment to tell you a little bit about a new tool the\nPhiladelphia Fed recently launched that I think you will find very interesting — and important.\nOne of the ways we can ensure that the coming recovery is both equitable and durable is to get more\npeople into middle-class jobs. And so, the tool came out of the work done by researchers at the\nPhiladelphia Fed and the Cleveland Fed who began by asking a question: How do we transition workers\nin low-paying, unstable jobs into what we call opportunity occupations — jobs that pay above the\nmedian wage and that don’t require a college degree.\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of the people who currently hold\nthose low-opportunity jobs. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent\nmore than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly\nhalf of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring\nsimilar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay\ndifferences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in\nsalary.\nWe’ve recently launched an interactive online tool — the Occupational Mobility Explorer — to help\nworkers and employers make those transitions. Once you are in Explorer, you can select your\ngeographic location and current occupation, and you will find a variety of jobs that require similar skills\nand pay at least 10 percent more in wages.\n\n4\n\n\fFor example, receptionists here in the Philadelphia area will find that they possess many of the skills\nnecessary to become a medical secretary, a job that pays about 27 percent more — on average, a bump\nin salary from around $30,000 to $38,000.\nBill collectors in the Philadelphia area could boost their salary 45 percent, from an average of about\n$38,000 to nearly $55,000 by becoming a credit counselor — with the added bonus that people will\nactually want to answer the phone when you call.\nThe tool can also be used by workforce development practitioners, community colleges, and, of course,\nthe general public. It can help with reskilling programs, employee recruitment, and hiring practices as\nmillions of workers seek to reenter the job market as we emerge from the pandemic. There’s a lot of\ntalent out there that we as a society would be foolish to leave on the sidelines.\nSo, thanks so much again for having me. And now I’m happy to take some questions.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s great to be back in Delaware. And thanks to the magic of virtual conferences, I didn’t\neven have to fight traffic on I-95 to be here with you.\nI’m really looking forward to our discussion today — especially the Q&A portion. But before we get to\nthat, I’d like to offer you a few thoughts on where we are economically, both nationally and in Delaware.\nI’d also like to talk a bit about how we can build a more equitable and sustainable economy as we\nrecover from the pandemic.\nBut before we do that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nThe State of the Economy\nI last addressed this group almost a year ago. At the time, this “new normal” we’ve all become\naccustomed to was still just that: new. Nonessential businesses were shuttered, COVID-19 cases were\nspiking, and vaccines still seemed only a distant hope.\nLike most first-year anniversaries, ours is a fairly happy one.\n1\n\n\fThat’s because, although last year and the early part of 2021 were really, really tough — and tragic for\nmillions of Americans — things have noticeably begun to turn around.\nEconomic data like employment and manufacturing figures came in stronger over the last couple of\nmonths than many of us expected. While I’m concerned about the downside risks from COVID-19\nvariants and the alarming virus spikes in states like Michigan, I still think that a combination of increased\nvaccinations, falling COVID-19 case rates, and a huge dose of fiscal stimulus should buoy the national\neconomy. For now, I’m expecting GDP growth to come in around 5 to 6 percent in 2021. I would expect\nthe labor market to parallel GDP growth and unemployment to fall throughout this year.\nFor now, Fed policy is going to hold steady. We’ll keep the federal funds rate very low and continue\nmaking more than $100 billion in monthly Treasury bond and mortgage-backed securities purchases.\nWhile the economic situation is improving, recovery is still in its early stages, and there’s no reason to\nwithdraw support yet.\nEconomic data for Delaware, meanwhile, indicate a real recovery is underway here as well. But it’s very\nmuch a work in progress.\nPayroll data show that the state has recovered more than 60 percent of the jobs lost at the beginning of\nthe pandemic — but we’re still around 24,500 jobs below where we were before COVID-19. That’s\nenough for the unemployment rate in the state to have fallen from 13.4 percent a year ago to 6.3\npercent now. That’s encouraging, of course, though in February 2020, the unemployment rate in\nDelaware was 4.5 percent. Labor force participation is similarly improving, but it’s still down from prepandemic highs. It now sits at 61.3 percent, up from last April’s 60.1 percent, but down from last\nFebruary’s 62.7 percent.\nThose broad numbers mask vast disparities across different segments of the economy, of course.\nFinance and insurance — collectively responsible for nearly 30 percent of Delaware’s GDP — have\nremained basically unscathed, a remarkable development for those of us who recall the Great Recession\nof 2008 and 2009.\nThe same cannot be said for tourism and hospitality. Net revenue at Delaware’s small businesses in the\nleisure and hospitality sector continues to hover around 50 percent of prepandemic numbers. But even\nhere, there are hopeful signs. The Rehoboth Beach‒Dewey Beach area is reporting an uptick in demand\nfor weekend accommodations — demand now outstrips prepandemic times, likely a sign that people\n2\n\n\fwho may have traveled farther afield in other years are now sticking closer to home. And open job\npostings in hospitality and leisure have been climbing for months.\nManufacturing, collectively responsible for about 6 percent of the state’s economic production, is also\nshowing an increase in hiring, though it’s still just slightly below the prepandemic trend. In a sign of\nincreased productivity, the manufacturing of chemical products, as well as food, beverages, and tobacco\nproducts, are all up from 2019, despite a slightly smaller workforce.\nAnd lastly, it may be bad news if you happen to be a chicken, but good news for Delaware’s people:\nAgriculture has remained steady during this period. The number of operating farms in the state has not\nchanged during the pandemic.\nIntroducing the Occupational Mobility Explorer\nSo, a recovery is clearly underway. And with that comes a great opportunity for all of us. We can shape\nwhat’s coming to build a recovery that is equitable and durable.\nLet me tell you a little bit about a new tool the Philadelphia Fed recently launched that I think you will\nfind very interesting — and hopefully useful for your businesses.\nThe tool came out of work done by researchers at the Philadelphia Fed and the Cleveland Fed. They\nbegan by asking a question: How do we transition workers in low-paying, unstable jobs into what we call\nopportunity occupations — jobs that pay above the median wage and that don’t require a college\ndegree.\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of the people who currently hold\nthose low-opportunity jobs. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent\nmore than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly\nhalf of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring\nsimilar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay\ndifferences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in\nsalary.\n\n3\n\n\fWe’ve recently launched an interactive online tool — the Occupational Mobility Explorer — to help\nworkers and employers make those transitions. Once you are in Explorer, you can select your\ngeographic location and current occupation, and you will find a variety of jobs that require similar skills\nand pay at least 10 percent more in wages.\nFor example, receptionists here in the Philadelphia‒Wilmington area will find that they possess many of\nthe skills necessary to become a medical secretary, a job that pays about 26 percent more — on\naverage, a bump in salary from around $30,000 to $38,000. Bill collectors in the Wilmington area could\nbump their salary 45 percent, from an average of about $38,000 to nearly $55,000 by becoming a credit\ncounselor — with the added bonus that people will actually want to answer the phone when you call.\nThe tool can also be used by workforce development practitioners, community colleges, and, of course,\nall of you. The Explorer can help inform your reskilling programs, employee recruitment, and hiring\npractices as millions of workers seek to reenter the job market as we emerge from the pandemic.\nThere’s a lot of talent out there that we would be foolish to leave on the sidelines.\nAffordable Childcare\nAnother factor that has driven far too many talented people out of the workforce is a dearth of childcare\noptions. The Philadelphia Fed, in partnership with the Delaware Chamber, is piloting a Research in\nAction Lab focused on providing childcare options. I know we are planning a full briefing sometime this\nsummer, so I don’t want to play the spoiler.\nBut I do want to point out the economic cost that all of us incur when people — and let’s be frank,\nmostly mothers — leave the labor force because they can’t find an affordable option for taking care of\ntheir kids during the workday. Like quality education, affordable childcare is not merely a “nice to have”\n— it’s an economic necessity.\nAnd it’s an expensive one. Here in Delaware, it costs the median-earning family 20 percent of their\nincome to pay for the care of a child under 5 years old. That’s a heavy burden — even before COVID-19\nshuttered many schools and childcare centers, further straining families.\nMaking childcare more affordable is a complex issue, but one that surely requires our attention. Already,\none of the most oft-cited reasons couples give for having fewer children than they say they want is the\ncost of raising them.\n4\n\n\fMy colleagues at the Minneapolis Fed have found that, at the outset of the pandemic, many parents of\nyoung children left the labor force — 3.4 percent of fathers and 2.9 percent of mothers dropped out\naltogether. But in the ensuing year, most fathers have returned to the labor force, while the\nparticipation rate of mothers of young children is still down 2.8 percentage points from before the\npandemic. As with all those workers with skills languishing in low-opportunity jobs, too much human\ncapital is lying untapped.\nSo, again, thank you so much for having me here. Hopefully this fall I’ll see all of you when I’m cheering\nfor the Blue Hens — in person.\nAnd now, I’m happy to take questions.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fLinking Community Banks and Fintech Platforms\nJoint Virtual Symposium: Fintech Partnership\nPhiladelphia, PA (Virtual)\n\nApril 1, 2021\n\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello! It’s really great to be here, and I’m thrilled that we have such a large turnout. The interest in this\nevent was so large, in fact, that here at the Fed, we had our own fintech issue as we were organizing it:\nWe had to cap attendance to protect bandwidth!\nThat’s a good problem to have, of course, and I think it really speaks to the terrific program that the staff\nat the Philadelphia Fed has put together for all of us — and to the robust interest in fostering a dialogue\nbetween fintech platforms and community banks from all over the country.\nSo, again, welcome. I just regret that for those of you on the West Coast this program has to be BYOB ―\nBring Your Own Breakfast.\nNow, before we proceed, I have to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Importance of Community Banks\nHere at the Fed we wear many hats: We’re a bank, a supervisor and regulator of other banks, and the\nlargest collection of economists in the world. We have the ability to lend money, to foster payments and\nsettlements, and to promote consumer protection and community development.\n\n1\n\n\fWe also have the power to convene. And that is precisely our aim this week: to provide a forum for open\ndiscussion among community bankers, bank regulators, and the fintech industry. We’re delighted you’re\nhere to learn about the new tools available to improve risk valuations and to enhance the customer\nexperience for clients ― among other exciting new technologies.\nI’m particularly glad that we have so many CEOs and CTOs of small community banks here today. While I\nprobably don’t need to belabor the importance of community banks to this particular audience, I think it\nsometimes gets lost just how central community banks are to our economy ― and indeed, to American\nsociety.\nJust consider the numbers. There are more than 4,800 active community bank charters across the\ncountry. And of those, almost exactly half are in communities with fewer than 50,000 residents.\nCommunity banks ― those with $10 billion or less in assets ― collectively hold more than $3 trillion in\nassets. You don’t need to rewatch It’s a Wonderful Life for the hundredth time to get a sense of how\nvitally important these institutions are.\nRisks and Opportunities\nCOVID-19 and its associated economic effects have also emphasized the importance of community\nbanks. But they have also heightened the risks to the sector in a world where more and more business is\nconducted online.\nGiven their strong relationships with local businesses, community banks were absolutely essential to\noperating the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which has kept so many small businesses afloat\nduring the shutdowns. According to my Fed colleague, Governor Michelle Bowman, community banks\nhave made up about 40 percent of the total value of PPP loans issued. It’s probably no exaggeration to\nsay that PPP would have failed without community banks’ support.\nBut economic shutdowns imposed to curtail the spread of COVID-19 ― particularly those that shuttered\nbank branches ― have also demonstrated just how important digitization is and the perils of falling\nbehind on fintech.\nOnline platforms have gobbled up an increasing number of home mortgages, for instance ― particularly\nas COVID-19 has deemphasized the importance of the in-person interactions that are the bread and\nbutter of community banking. I would encourage community bankers to explore digitization\n\n2\n\n\fopportunities for your institution and customers, as well as innovative opportunities that align with your\nstrategic plans.\nI understand, of course, that there are challenges. Smaller banks often simply don’t have the workforce\nor the cash to first, research and investigate, and then to ultimately invest in costly fintech platforms.\nThey lack the economies of scale that bigger banks enjoy. Set-up costs can be prohibitive. And, to be\nfrank, there are occasional cultural differences between the “move fast and break things” ethos of many\nfintech suppliers and the more risk-averse sensibilities of bankers.\nAnd those risks are real. Consider the astonishing rapidity of technological development. There are\nserious and understandable concerns that a year or two after making an expensive fintech investment,\nthe technology will already become obsolete. You don’t want to be stuck with a bunch of buggy whips a\nyear before the invention of the Model T.\nAnd there can be a hesitancy to embrace new technologies on the client side, too, of course. A banker in\nour area recently told me that despite her bank’s investment in fintech ― and even with her branch\noffices closed ― many clients still use the drive-through windows to do things they could easily do at\nhome. They’re even willing to wait for 20 minutes in their car to do so. Although, given the pandemic\nconditions that have kept many of us at home for a year, I certainly understand the need to get out of\nthe house.\nConclusion\nIt is precisely because of these opportunities and these risks that this symposium is such a great\nopportunity for all of us. Constructive dialogue between fintech firms and community banks offers a\npath forward for both. We can listen, and we can learn from each other.\nThe Federal Reserve, for its part, is very supportive of innovation. We’re here to convene, to support,\nand to supervise.\nThanks again and enjoy the event.\n\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fThe Opportunity Gap and How to Fix It\n2021 AL DÍA Roundtable\nBack to Work: Leveraging Your Skills to Find Better Opportunities\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nMarch 3, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s really great to be here. The kind of research we’re going to be discussing today is\nabsolutely critical to building a healthy economy that supports all Americans — and just as important as\nthe work the Fed does on monetary policy and interest rates. So I’m really pleased to see so many of you\nhere.\nI’m also happy to be here on this day in particular. Today is the 156th anniversary of the founding of the\nFreedman’s Savings Bank, which was created after the Civil War to help develop the financial\nindependence of African Americans following the abolition of slavery.\nNow, before I proceed, whenever I’m talking about any of the work the Fed does, I have to provide the\nstandard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nIn a few minutes, you’re going to hear all about our Occupational Mobility Explorer, a truly exciting tool\nthat I think will help to move the needle when it comes to helping transition people into familysustaining careers. We know that it’s not just a skills gap that is holding many people back, but it’s an\nopportunity gap as well. The Explorer is designed with that in mind.\n\n1\n\n\fBut before we do that, I think it’s worth addressing why the Occupational Mobility Explorer is so\nimportant, particularly for Black and Latino communities here in our area and across the country. Simply\nput, Black and Latino workers are struggling more than others. That’s a trend that long predated the\npandemic — and that has also only been heightened by it.\nIn the state of Pennsylvania, the Black unemployment rate is 17.2 percent, and the White\nunemployment rate is 7.8 percent. Labor participation is also lower among African Americans than other\ngroups.\nAnd across the country, the picture looks grimly similar: Nationally, Black unemployment stands at 9.2\npercent versus 5.7 percent for White workers. Meanwhile, the country’s unemployment rate for Latinos\nis 8.7 percent.\nWomen across all races have also been severely impacted by the pandemic. Nearly 3 million women\nhave dropped out of the formal labor force since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\nEven with some hopeful signs as virus cases fall and the economy continues to reopen, I’m concerned\nthat, as the broader economy climbs upward, far too many workers are being left behind. As of late last\nyear, 75 percent of GDP losses from the COVID-19 pandemic had been recouped — but only 60 percent\nof job losses had been reversed. Those job losses have been concentrated among racial and ethnic\nminorities and women. We also know that, after prior recessions, it took longer for Black and Latino\nunemployment rates to drop than it did for other groups.\nStructural barriers have impeded the progress of minorities and women since even before the founding\nof the country. And today, forces like job segregation, inequality in education, and sometimes even\noutright discrimination continue to hold back far too many of our fellow Americans.\nThat’s why it’s imperative that in striving to redress our country’s stark inequities, we focus on root and\nbranch reform rather than quick fixes.\nHere at the Philadelphia Fed, that means our approach acknowledges and examines the root causes of\nemployment disparities; targets interventions to disproportionately affected populations; removes\n2\n\n\fbarriers to work, training, and education; encourages improved job quality and support for workers; and\nincreases access to career pathways that lead to financial stability. I’m an engineer by trade, and I know\nthe importance of building sturdy foundations.\nBuilding a more equitable economy is not just ― in my view ― an urgent moral task, but an important\none for our economy as well. According to my colleagues at the San Francisco Fed, the economic loss\nowing to racial and gender disparities in our labor market stands at around $2.6 trillion. The bottom line\n― quite literally ― is that we will all benefit from a more inclusive economy.\nThat’s why today’s conversation is so important: It is about helping the incredibly talented people in our\nregion connect to opportunities, leverage their skills, and connect with training and job placement\nprograms.\nSo, thank you again for joining us today. And now over to you, Keith.\n\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fCredentials, Colleges, and Economic Mobility\nUneven Outcomes in the Labor Market:\nUnderstanding Trends and Identifying Solutions\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nFebruary 3, 2021\n\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning, good afternoon, and good evening to this audience spanning time zones! It’s an honor to\nbe here today at this very important conference. And as a recovering academic, I’m particularly\ndelighted to be here on Day 3, when we will be discussing credentials and higher education. This is a\nvitally important topic for the health of communities across our country, and I truly thank you for having\nme.\nNow, before we proceed with today’s program, many of you veterans of Fed events will know what’s\ncoming next: that’s right, the standard Fed disclaimer. The views I express today are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nPathways to Success\nEducation has long been an engine of economic mobility, and economic mobility is something\napproaching a national creed of the United States. We believe that anybody ― no matter how humble\nthe circumstances in which they were born ― should have a pathway to the middle class.\nFor me, that pathway was football. I grew up in a blue-collar town next to Camden, NJ. My dad, a union\npipefitter, died when I was 9. Much-needed financial aid landed me at Penn where I was a firstgeneration college student. That was the beginning of a journey that I could never have imagined when I\nwas a boy growing up in South Jersey.\n1\n\n\fOthers’ pathways are going to look different from mine. And given that 40 years later I’m still carrying\naround injuries I got playing football at Penn, that’s probably a good thing.\nBut unfortunately, far too many Americans born in tough circumstances, particularly racial and ethnic\nminorities, are having a tough time finding their pathway up. It’s incumbent on all of us as Americans to\nthink hard about how we are going to fix what ― to my mind ― is a profound moral problem: the lack of\neconomic mobility.\nSo, what do we do?\nSkills More Than Degrees\nI’m a career academic and former university president, so this probably sounds like Ronald McDonald\nadmonishing you to lay off saturated fat. But the truth is that many ― maybe most ― Americans don’t\nneed a traditional four-year college degree. What they need are the skills that will propel them into\nmiddle-class jobs. For my dad, my uncles, and my brother, that was pipefitting. And for many, that’s still\na great option. For others, it will be something else.\nMany skills today are gained through a variety of short-term programs that do not lead to degrees but\ncan provide marketable new skills. These courses can be as short as two months, and students ― many\nof whom are in their midcareer and are looking to retool ― gain a marketable new skill. According to a\nrecent Georgetown University study, these can make a meaningful difference in enrollees’ careers:\nCertificates in engineering technologies can lead to high earnings, as do those in fields like information\ntechnology and legal studies. Indeed, the study found some certificates can yield earnings that rival\nthose of bachelor’s degrees in other fields.\nThese short-term credentials can be gained in many venues, from traditional community colleges, to\nprivate academies like computer coding boot camps both online and brick and mortar, to public‒private\npartnerships designed to provide pipelines of talent to the private sector. The way the latter works is\nthat companies essentially outsource a portion of their employee training to outside vendors, using a\n“pay for success” model. That means the company reimburses the entity that paid for the training in the\nfirst place ― say, the local publicly funded job board ― if the new hire hits certain benchmarks, like\nstaying on the job for six months. It can be an effective way to entice corporations to hire from\npopulations they may find too risky or for which they lack sufficient familiarity, particularly those in\n\n2\n\n\funderserved communities. The workers will benefit, of course, but so will the companies who will have\naccess to an undertapped pool of talent.\nAll in all, getting new skills for people strikes me as a situation in which we need to experiment across a\nwide variety of approaches and methods. We have a lot to learn, and the task couldn’t be more\nimportant.\nAt the Fed, we’ve also been studying ways to get people into what we call opportunity occupations —\njobs that pay the median wage or better and that don’t require a four-year college degree. What’s truly\nexciting is that our researchers have found that many workers already possess the skills they need to\nincrease their income ― all they might need is a little additional training.\nMy colleagues in Cleveland and Philadelphia looked at the skill sets of people who are holding at-risk or\nlow-wage jobs. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than\ntheir current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. Looking at 33 metro areas\nnationwide, they found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one\nhigher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations\nidentified in the study, the average bump in wages was almost $15,000 ― real money. On our website,\nwe’ve recently launched what we call an Occupational Mobility Explorer, where workers can plug in\ntheir own skills, where they live, and see what’s out there.\nThe Four-Year Option\nFor others, a four-year degree is still going to be the best option. But far too many students, through no\nfault of their own, enter demanding institutions without adequate preparation. Many have\nunfortunately attended high schools that left them ill prepared for college-level work or have had life\nchallenges that have left them unprepared for the demands of a selective college or university. That can\nbe disastrous, because once a student falls behind academically, it’s very, very difficult to catch up.\nThat’s why I’d like to talk a little bit about a program at the University of Delaware (UD), where I used\nto be president. UD’s Associate in Arts Program not only provides a pipeline of students into the\nuniversity, but also makes sure they are poised to succeed once they get there. I hope our experience\nin Delaware can provide a useful example for states nationwide.\n\n3\n\n\fThe way the associate in arts program works is this: UD courses are taught by UD faculty in small classes\nin Delaware Tech buildings throughout the state. (Delaware Tech is the state’s public community\ncollege.)\nStudents receive an associate’s degree in University Studies by earning credits in the core courses that\nare required of all undergraduates, and then transition to UD’s main campus to earn their bachelor’s\ndegree. Most full-time students receive money from the state to cover their tuition. The program is high\ntouch, with small class sizes and lots of interaction between faculty and students.\nI’m thrilled to report that 64 percent of students in the program graduate with their associate’s degree\nwithin three years — well above the national average of around 33 percent. Of those, 88 percent go\nonto the main campus at UD, and nearly 80 percent of those graduate with a bachelor’s degree.\nBecause the program is taught by UD faculty, the transition from associate’s to bachelor’s degree\nbecomes something approaching seamless. A member of the English faculty who is teaching in the\nassociate in arts program knows exactly what her students are prepared for once they enter a UD\nEnglish course, for instance.\nIs the associate in arts program going to be replicable in every context across our vast country ―\nparticularly when state budgets are under pressure and education funding is under threat? Of course\nnot. But as with certification programs, I’m suggesting we let a thousand flowers bloom. Now is the time\nto experiment with new models and new pathways to success.\nFunding Options\nAs with so much else in modern life, a big question surrounding all of this is: How do you pay for it? The\ntraditional student loan has become a millstone around the necks of far too many Americans. Total\nstudent loan debt now tops $1.7 trillion, surpassing credit card debt and second only to mortgages.\nResearchers at the Philadelphia Fed and throughout the Federal Reserve System have studied the ways\nin which student debt burdens affect subsequent credit outcomes and life events. And all the while,\nstudent loan programs are often disproportionately inaccessible to lower-income and minority\nborrowers due to stringent credit criteria. Besides, many microcredential courses like coding boot camps\ntypically aren’t eligible for federal student loans, meaning many students dig deep into their own\npockets or borrow money from family and friends to make necessary investments in their careers.\n\n4\n\n\fAnd even among those students who receive student loans and generous financial aid, that sometimes\nisn’t enough. At the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve studied the effects of Bridging the Gap, an innovative\nprogram at Rutgers University‒Camden that significantly reduces or even eliminates 100 percent of\ntuition for middle- and low-income students.\nWhat we found is that, even though reduced tuition was a huge help, many students still had challenges\nmanaging ongoing living and educational expenses beyond tuition. They still needed to work to support\ntheir families, for instance, or scrimp and save for books and other educational materials. Another\nchallenge for students is geographic; it can be emotionally and economically difficult for students to\nleave their hometowns for education ― particularly, again, if their family members count on them for\nfinancial support.\nIncome-based repayment programs offer one potential alternative worth exploring. They are designed\nso students make payments once their incomes rise above a minimum threshold, and students will\nnever pay more than the cap set at the onset of the agreement. But absent strict oversight, incomebased repayment programs could be ripe for abuse, so regulators will need to keep a very close eye on\nthem.\nThe bottom line is this: There is an urgent need for education ― certificate or degree based ― to be\nmore affordable for more people.\nThis will take input and action from many segments of society ― government, civil society, the\ncorporate sector, and, perhaps especially, from the universities and colleges themselves. The Fed has a\nrole to play, too, with our research and convening power.\nTo me, increasing accessibility to education in all its forms is not only an economic imperative but a\nmoral one as well. Indeed, the economic effects of the pandemic are already having a noticeable impact\non enrollment among our country’s most disadvantaged.\nAccording to the National Student Clearinghouse, enrollment at two-year institutions was down\nsignificantly in fall 2020 versus the prior year. First-time enrollment and enrollment for many wellpaying vocational programs are even further down. These declines are concentrated among freshmen\nenrollees ― particularly Black, Hispanic, and Native American students. This is a trend we need to do\neverything in our power to reverse. Once again, too many pathways are being blocked.\n\n5\n\n\fWith so much at stake and this being such an important topic, I thank you again for having me today.\nBut before I go, with the recent change in administration in Washington, and the Super Bowl coming up,\nI can’t resist making one more plug for my old university. Did you know that UD is one of only five\nschools nationwide to have graduated both a Super Bowl starting quarterback and a U.S. president?\nSo, thank you again for having me. Now over to you, Keith.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fThe Outlook for 2021 Nationally and Locally\nPhiladelphia Business Journal Economic Forecast\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJanuary 7, 2021\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s great to be here … at least in some form. I’m hopeful that the next time we convene\nit will be in 3D.\nAnd happy new year! After the year we just had ― filled with tremendous loss, pain, and dislocation and\ndisunity in our nation ― I and my colleagues at the Fed recommit our efforts to serve the Third District\nand the country in order to build a strong and inclusive economy, an economy that works for all\nAmericans.\nMy plan for this morning is to share a few thoughts on where the national economy is now and where\nit’s headed. Given that this is a Philadelphia audience, I’ll then offer some thoughts on the outlook for\nour region. After that, we’ll open things up for a Q&A, which I’m really looking forward to. I will\nespecially welcome the hard questions, such as “What became of our Eagles this year?”\nBut before we proceed, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nThe State of the Virus\nNow, it’s no secret that the economy has been profoundly affected by the same scourge that has kept us\nphysically apart today: COVID-19.\n\n1\n\n\fWhen you’re looking for a house, a realtor will tell you what the three most important things are:\nlocation, location, and location. And when you’re talking to a Fed president, he or she will tell you that\nthe three most important things affecting the economy are: the virus, the virus, the virus.\nSo, let’s begin with where we are with COVID-19, given that the virus itself ― more than anything else\n― is determining the trajectory of the economy.\nIn the space of about a year, the virus has infected more than 85 million people around the world and\nkilled more than 1.8 million. In the U.S., the death toll has now surpassed 350,000. The math is stark:\nWith 4 percent of the world’s population, we’ve suffered 20 percent of the world’s fatalities. Certain\ncommunities have borne the brunt of the virus more than others, with racial minorities both becoming\ninfected with the coronavirus and dying at higher rates than White Americans.\nWhile the number of infections and deaths fell during the warmer months, cases have been on the rise\nsince September. And deaths, a lagging indicator, are tragically now even more voluminous than they\nwere during the first wave of COVID-19 last spring.\nIt’s truly impressive that several pharmaceutical companies were able to develop highly effective\nvaccines for COVID-19 at warp speed ― a real tribute to modern ingenuity. But what matters more than\nvaccines is vaccinations ― that is, getting needles in people’s arms.\nThere, our country’s performance has been incredibly disappointing so far. Fewer than 5 million people\nhave received their first dose of the vaccine ― less than 2 percent of our total population. In Israel, by\ncontrast, they’ve managed to distribute the first dose to more than 15 percent of the country’s\npopulation.\nThe State of the National Economy\nCOVID-19 has been utterly determinative of the U.S. economy’s performance, both as local\ngovernments impose measures to curtail the spread, which depress economic activity, and as\nconsumers change their behavior to protect themselves and their loved ones. The latter is a crucial point\nthat sometimes gets lost.\nBut the bottom line is this: If people don’t feel safe, they won’t engage in the broader economy.\nAnd so, even before state and local governments took action last spring, many Americans had stopped\ndining out, getting on airplanes, and boarding public transit. That’s a trend that has continued\n2\n\n\fthroughout the pandemic. Many local governments have introduced measures to curtail indoor\nrestaurant dining. But even before that, data that we look at here at the Fed showed that people had\nbegun dining out less.\nIt isn’t surprising then that the economy has largely tracked the spread of the virus. In the second\nquarter of last year, as the U.S. endured its first wave of COVID-19 and as state and local governments\nimplemented various shutdown measures, the U.S. experienced its worst quarterly GDP drop in\nrecorded history. The economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 32 percent; 22 million jobs\nevaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were the hardest hit.\nFollowing that contraction, the economy rebounded quite nicely. Stay-at-home orders were lifted, and\nmillions of Americans returned to their jobs. Indeed, a little more than half of those 22 million residents\nwho were suddenly out of work earlier in 2020 are now back, enough to nudge the unemployment rate\ndown from 14.7 percent in April to 6.7 percent today, which is still far too high, especially because the\nheadline number masks the millions of Americans who have simply dropped out of the labor force. It’s\nalso troubling that the ranks of the long-term unemployed have swelled.\nOur country’s economic tribulations, tracking the path of the virus, have wreaked havoc on people’s\nlives. Since the onset of the pandemic, the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute has conducted\nseveral nationwide surveys of consumers about their financial situation.\nNot surprisingly, last spring saw a huge surge in Americans facing financial hardship. But then, as cases\ndeclined in the warmer months and the economy reopened, things looked up. Between April and July\n2020, respondents to the survey reported steady improvements. Increasingly fewer of those responding\nto the survey reported losing their job, experiencing declines in income, and having trouble making ends\nmeet.\nWith the resurgence of the virus, those trends have turned sharply negative once again. While the latest\nsurvey found fewer respondents reporting job losses, they did report more income declines and\nincreased concerns about their financial futures.\nThe hard times will be with us for a little while longer. On the national level, for now, I’m expecting the\nfourth quarter of last year to show modest growth, before a significant slowing in the first quarter of this\nyear ― possibly even negative growth. In other words, “happy new year” has a caveat.\n\n3\n\n\fThe good news is that the weakness should stay relatively short lived ― as we all hope COVID-19\nvaccinations become more widely available. The recently passed $900 billion of fiscal support ― while\nwe can quibble over the details ― should also help buoy the economy. I am optimistic that in the second\nhalf of 2021, the economy ― and frankly, life ― should begin to look much more normal. GDP growth\nshould be strong in the second half of the year, and through 2022, before a light tapering in 2023.\nThe State of the Local Economy\nHere in our area, the situation should look similar to the national picture, with slow to negative growth\nin the beginning of the year and a much healthier ― in all senses of the word ― second half of 2021.\nOur region, for better or worse, tends to be roughly a middle-of-the-pack player when it comes to\neconomic trends. We don’t boom like some areas, but we don’t bust like them either.\nLocal employment figures show that this trend has remained true during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of\nlate last year, in Pennsylvania, year-over-year employment was down 7.8 percent, which is roughly in\nthe middle of the pack among the states. In New York State, for instance, employment was down 11.2\npercent, whereas it was down only 4.5 percent in Texas.\nBut of course those numbers mask vast gaps across different sectors of the economy within our region.\nIn the Philadelphia area, like in the rest of the country, the hardest hit sectors have been leisure and\nhospitality and education and health services. In leisure and hospitality alone, nearly 100,000 jobs have\nbeen lost in the Philadelphia MSA since March. The upshot is that year over year, about 30 percent of\ntotal employment in that sector has evaporated ― a stunning decline. In education and health services,\nmeanwhile, nearly 30,000 jobs have been eliminated since the onset of the pandemic.\nManufacturing, by contrast, has held up relatively well, with employment down less than 5 percent.\nOutput in manufacturing has remained strong as well, with activity at or above pre-pandemic levels. And\ngiven that employment has declined slightly in manufacturing and output has not, this means the sector\nhas figured out ways of being more productive during the pandemic.\nThe Coming Recovery\nI expect that, as we recover, the economic picture will remain uneven, with wildly unequal outcomes\nacross sectors of the economy. There’s a strong chance that consumer habits will have changed long\nterm, even when we’ve finally rid ourselves of COVID-19. That will have significant impacts.\n4\n\n\fWith the boom in videoconferencing, for instance, business travel could remain depressed indefinitely,\nplacing stress on hotels and restaurants. Americans may have become even more addicted to online\nshopping, harming the physical retail industry. And higher education ― my old industry ― faces major\nthreats not only from changes brought on by the pandemic, but also from the country’s demographics.\nThe traditional college-age population has actually begun to decline.\nAll of these changes would in turn have knock-on effects to other sectors of the economy, like\ncommercial real estate. And a downturn in commercial real estate would, of course, affect the financial\nindustry … et cetera, et cetera.\nAutomation represents another challenge. Researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have found that many of\nthe jobs that the pandemic eliminated may never return ― even after the virus has passed. They will\ninstead be automated. To take an example near and dear to all of our hearts, the Pennsylvania Turnpike\nhas switched permanently to automatic tolling ― a change that was initially spurred by the onset of the\npandemic and the need to promote social distancing.\nToday, I’d like to challenge all of us to think hard about ways to make sure the coming recovery is not\nonly strong, but equitable.\nAnd that’s a subject I would be happy to address more during the Q&A, as the Philadelphia Fed is\nworking on a number of important projects. It’s my firm belief that, as we emerge from this tragic\nperiod, we can seize many opportunities to build the society we all want.\nSo, thank you, and happy new year once again. Now let’s open this up for discussion.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning! It’s great to be back among so many of “my people.”\nYou might say, after all, that I have at least a minor connection to Wharton, and to Penn in general. I\nwent to Penn for undergrad. And I also have a master’s from Penn ― two of them actually. And a Ph.D.\nfrom Penn. I was a professor at Penn. Oh, and as many of you know, I was also dean of the Wharton\nSchool.\nI should probably also mention that my wife went to Penn. And so did two of my three children. And\nPenn doctors recently performed surgery on my foot to rectify an old injury that I sustained … playing\nfootball at Penn.\nSo, yes, it’s wonderful to be back ― in some form ― at what feels an awful lot like a second home.\nNow, before we proceed, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nMy plan for this morning is to share a few thoughts on where the economy is now and where it’s\nheaded. I’ll also offer some observations on how we can build a durable and equitable recovery as we\nemerge from this period. After that, we’ll open things up for a fireside chat with some Q&A, which I’m\nreally looking forward to. I especially welcome the hard questions, such as what on Earth is going on\nwith Carson Wentz?\n\n1\n\n\fThe State of the Virus\nIt’s no secret that the economy has been profoundly affected by the same scourge that has kept us\nphysically apart today: COVID-19. The three most important things affecting the economy are: the virus,\nthe virus, the virus.\nSo, let’s begin with where we are with COVID-19, given that the virus itself ― more than anything else\n― is determining the trajectory of the economy.\nIn the space of about a year, the virus has infected more than 60 million people around the world and\nkilled more than 1.4 million. In the U.S., the death toll has now surpassed 260,000. The math is stark:\nWith 4 percent of the world’s population, we’ve suffered 20 percent of the world’s fatalities.\nAnd even within this disproportionately hard-hit country, certain communities have suffered more than\nothers. Racial minorities have been sickened from the coronavirus at a far higher rate than other groups.\nThey have also died at a higher rate. And in the ensuing economic contraction, they have lost their jobs\nat a higher rate.\nWhile the number of infections and deaths fell during the warmer months, cases have been on the\nuptick since the week ending September 8. Deaths ― a lagging indicator ― are unfortunately now back\nto the highs we had not seen since the first wave in the spring. We are clearly in the midst of a second\nwave that, while not unexpected, is still shocking and heartbreaking in its viciousness.\nThe State of the Economy\nCOVID-19’s resurgence is bound to have an economic effect, both as local governments introduce\nmeasures to curtail the spread and as consumers change their behavior. The latter is a crucial point that\nsometimes gets lost.\nIf people don’t feel safe, they won’t engage in the broader economy. And so, even before state and local\ngovernments took action this spring, many Americans had stopped dining out, getting on airplanes, and\nchecking into hotels. That’s a trend that has continued throughout the pandemic. Some local\ngovernments, including Philadelphia, have recently introduced measures to curtail indoor restaurant\ndining. But even before that, data showed that people had begun dining out less. Some people may\nhave traveled over the Thanksgiving holiday, but TSA data indicated that passenger traffic was still down\nby more than half of what it was last year. In short, government actions to stop the spread of COVID-19\nare somewhat of a lagging indicator as well.\n2\n\n\fIt isn’t surprising, then, that the economy has largely tracked the spread of the virus. In the second\nquarter of this year, as the U.S. experienced its first wave of COVID-19 and as state and local\ngovernments implemented various shutdown measures, the U.S. experienced its worst quarterly GDP\ndrop in recorded history. The economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 32 percent; 22 million\njobs evaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were hardest hit.\nFollowing that contraction, the economy rebounded quite nicely. Stay-at-home orders were lifted, and\nmillions of Americans returned to their jobs. Indeed, a little more than half of those 22 million residents\nwho were suddenly out of work earlier this year are now back, enough to nudge the unemployment rate\ndown from 14.7 percent in April to 6.9 percent, which is still disastrously high. The recovery has been\nuneven, with segments like manufacturing and housing outpacing hospitality and leisure.\nFor now, I’m forecasting moderate growth for the rest of this year and the first quarter of 2021 that\nkeeps us below the prepandemic trend. Indeed, we are currently seeing signs of plateauing in the\neconomy. That’s attributable both to COVID-19’s continued circulation and to the evaporation of fiscal\nsupport ― particularly for low-income households ― that the federal government provided at the onset\nof the pandemic. I recently had a conversation with a major banker who expressed deep concerns about\nthe fast-approaching “fiscal cliff,” as many Americans will soon lose their unemployment benefits and\nbegin to face hardships like eviction and foreclosure. Unemployment claims are already on the uptick.\nMy forecast calls for growth to pick up in the second half of 2021 and through 2022 before a light\ntapering in 2023. But that comes with two important caveats. For one, my forecast is premised on a safe\nand effective vaccine for COVID-19 ― or perhaps, multiple vaccines ― becoming available sometime in\nthe spring or summer of next year. We’ve had very encouraging news on that front in recent weeks. My\nforecast also expects an additional $1 trillion of fiscal support for the economy. There, the news has\nbeen less encouraging recently, which is my way of saying this forecast is very, very uncertain.\nThe Fed’s robust actions in dealing with this crisis ― cutting rates fast and early and establishing a\nnumber of lending facilities ― were effective in blunting the contraction. Even when those lending\nfacilities, such as our fund that was set up to aid state and local governments, were not tapped as often\nas we may have expected at the outset, their mere existence was useful in getting private markets\nflowing. We witnessed a so-called announcement effect. Markets that were largely frozen thawed when\nwe announced the establishment of those facilities.\n\n3\n\n\fIn my opinion, those facilities should stay open past the end of this year. Until we get through this\npandemic, the economy needs to be supported. At this point, the fewer changes we make to our lending\nfacilities, the better.\nRising Automation\nNow before we move to the discussion, I’d like to say a few words about the changes in our society that\nthe virus is spurring.\nFundamentally, rather than fully changing things, this pandemic has had the effect of accelerating trends\nthat were already present in our society. Categories like department stores were already struggling ―\nand COVID-19 only served to expedite their demise. Racial minorities like Black Americans were already\nmore likely to be unemployed than other groups, though one of the salutary trends of the prepandemic\neconomy was that this gap was narrowing. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has erased that progress.\nSimilarly, trends in labor markets like the increased use of automation are not new. They are simply\nhappening at a more rapid clip since the onset of the pandemic.\nFor decades, the U.S. economy has seen increasing automation in industries spanning manufacturing to\nfood service to office work. But the COVID-19 pandemic has ensured that those transitions are now\noccurring at lightning speed.\nResearchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been closely studying the effect of the pandemic on labor\nmarkets and automation and have made several key ― if still rather preliminary ― findings. I would like\nto share some with you.\nSome of their findings have been predictable: It turns out that the most automatable jobs are those that\ndo not permit remote work and those that carry a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Obviously,\nmachinery and software are not susceptible to the virus, so they have often become more attractive\noptions than human workers during the pandemic. Think of meatpacking and slaughterhouse jobs, for\nexample, which are increasingly automated.\nOr, closer to home, think of the Pennsylvania Turnpike laying off more than 500 workers this spring as it\nswitched to automatic tolling.\n\n4\n\n\fOther findings are more surprising and deeply alarming. You might expect that a lot of the jobs that\nwere eliminated because of COVID-19 might come roaring back after the virus passes, for example. But\nthis might not be the case.\nFed researchers have found, based on precedent dating to prior recessions, that, in fact, many of the\njobs that the pandemic eliminated may never return ― even after the virus has passed. They will instead\nbe automated. Those Pennsylvania Turnpike workers were permanently laid off, for instance.\nOur researchers have also found that minority workers are more likely than other groups to hold jobs\nthat could be lost ― permanently ― to automation. And that leads to the alarming conclusion that\npandemic-induced automation will ― as we have in fact seen ― only serve to accentuate preexisting\ndisparities in our society.\nWe can’t stop technological progress, of course. But this wave of automation will require each of us to\nthink hard about how we can transition affected workers into new, stable careers filled with\nopportunity.\nAt the Philadelphia Fed, we’re working hard on designing programs that can upskill people who are\nexperiencing labor force dislocation, which I’m happy to talk more about during our discussion. It’s my\nfirm belief that we can seize the opportunity as we emerge from this tragic period.\nSo, thank you, and now let’s open this up for discussion.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon! It’s an honor to be joined by all of you here today. As a Fed president, I’m not sure my\nstar power can match that of some of my fellow panelists. I’ll admit I’m no Deepak Chopra or T. D. Jakes,\nbut I’m also pretty thrilled to rub shoulders with them ― even if only virtually.\nBut on a serious note, Operation HOPE’s mission of ensuring financial uplift and economic inclusion for\nall Americans could not be more important ― or timelier, given present circumstances ― so I am very\nexcited and frankly flattered to be a part of this great series of events this week.\nI’m also excited to sketch out a few thoughts on our present circumstances and to chat with John\nBryant. But before I can get to that, there is something else I have to do. We call it the standard Fed\ndisclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nIt’s no secret to anyone here that we’re in the middle of twin crises the likes of which none of us has\never experienced. COVID-19 has sickened tens of millions of our fellow Americans and killed hundreds of\nthousands of them. And the virus, unfortunately, is still circulating widely throughout the country.\nThe pandemic also spurred an economic downturn so severe that, in the second quarter of this year, we\nexperienced the sharpest contraction of gross domestic product (or GDP) in recorded American history.\nMillions of Americans lost their jobs, and millions more had their hours cut.\nWe see the scars everywhere ― in the miles-long lines at foodbanks that indicate massive suffering and\nin the shuttered storefronts and restaurants that now dominate so many of our commercial districts\nthat just a few months ago were bustling.\n1\n\n\fIt’s also no secret that the effects of this unprecedented crisis have fallen most harshly on those least\nable to bear them. Racial minorities ― particularly Hispanic and Black Americans ― have been more\naffected by both the health crisis and the economic crisis than other groups.\nHispanics and Black Americans have been sickened by COVID-19 at a rate disproportionate to their\npopulation. They have also died at a higher rate. Those same groups also are more likely to hold jobs\nthat one can’t perform from home, which is probably one of the reasons their infection rates are higher\nthan other groups. They are also more likely to have held jobs that have either been replaced by\nautomation or that have simply been eliminated.\nThis is a five-alarm fire.\nThe one thing I truly admire about Operation HOPE is that it doesn’t just call itself a non-profit\norganization. It calls itself a for-purpose organization.\nThe Federal Reserve is also a for-purpose organization. Since the Fed is the nation’s central bank,\nCongress has mandated us to provide for maximum employment and stable prices ― that is, lots of jobs\nand low inflation.\nBut another purpose I believe we can work toward is narrowing the yawning racial disparities that\ncontinue to plague our society.\nSo, how do we do that?\nGiven that I am a Fed president, you probably guessed that I might say monetary policy. And I do think\nthat’s part of the solution. That’s why I’m pleased that, in late August, following a nearly two-year\nreview, the Fed announced a shift in our approach to fulfilling that dual mandate that I mentioned\nearlier.\nHere is the upshot: No longer will we head off higher inflation by preemptively raising interest rates\nbefore we have achieved full employment. Moreover, after long periods of sub-2 percent inflation (as\nwe now find ourselves in), we will accept periods of above-2 percent inflation. Tolerating the risk of\nslightly higher inflation, in our view, is worth it if it helps us achieve our employment goals.\nThat’s important because one of the salutary trends of the pre-COVID-19 economy was that economic\ngains, at least on a limited basis, were finally being enjoyed by lower-wage workers, a disproportionate\n\n2\n\n\fpercentage of whom are racial minorities. We still had a very, very long way to go, of course. But it’s\nclear that we must achieve full employment if we are going to make progress on this issue.\nWe also need to do a better job of transitioning workers into careers that offer solid pay and strong\nfuture prospects. Here at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve been thinking hard about how to get workers into\nwhat we call opportunity occupations ― that is, jobs that pay the median wage or better and that don’t\nrequire a college degree.\nI’d like to share the results of just one study we’ve done because I think the results are truly exciting.\nThe study began when Philadelphia Fed researchers, in partnership with the Cleveland Fed, asked a\nquestion: How do we transition workers in jobs most likely to disappear into stable, higher-wage\npositions?\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of people who are holding those jobs\nthat are most at risk of disappearing. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10\npercent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly\nhalf of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring\nsimilar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay\ndifferences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in\nsalary.\nThe opportunities for public‒private partnerships to initiate these kinds of transitions are obvious, and\nI’m proud to say that the Philadelphia Fed helped launch one with Comcast and Philadelphia Works, our\nlocal workforce development board. That’s just one project, of course, but if it proves to be replicable\nacross cities and industries, I really think we can begin to move the needle.\nThere is a division within the Federal Reserve that has defined racial equity as “the just and fair inclusion\nin an economy in which all can participate, prosper, and reach their full potential, and race can no longer\npredict life outcomes.” That’s a lofty goal, of course, but a really profound one, I think: the idea that we\ncan one day decouple race from life outcomes. If we get there, I know that Operation HOPE will have\nplayed a role.\nSo, thanks again for having me, and now I’m happy to chat with John Bryant.\n\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon and welcome! I’m thrilled to be with you today, even if we are meeting ― fittingly for\nthe topic of today’s webinar ― in a rather “artificial” format. We are all hoping that the next time we\ngather together, it will actually be in person.\nNow, we may be meeting in unusual circumstances today, but some things never change. One of those\nis my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nWe’re gathered here for what I’m certain will be a fascinating discussion on artificial intelligence ― and\nspecifically, the effect that COVID-19 has had on the field.\nCOVID-19 and the Economy\nBut I think there is an unwritten rule somewhere that every time a Fed president addresses an audience,\nhe or she also must also give an outlook on where the economy is headed. It’s one of the hazards of the\njob, I suppose.\nSo, I’ll begin with that, offering a quick look at where the economy has been, where it is now, and where\nit might be headed. And after that, I’ll share a few considerations on automation and AI.\nIt’s no secret that the economy has been profoundly affected by the same scourge that has kept us\nphysically apart today: COVID-19. So, let’s begin with where we are with COVID-19, given that the virus\nitself, more than anything else, is determining the trajectory of the economy.\n\n1\n\n\fAs you well know, still less than a year after COVID-19 first emerged, the virus has infected more than 30\nmillion people around the world and killed more than 1 million.\nOur own country has been particularly hard hit. Because of the United States’ inability to control the\nvirus, we’ve experienced approximately 21 percent of the world’s deaths, despite housing only about 4\npercent of the world’s population. Infection rates have come down from the highs we saw in the spring\nand summer, but the virus is still circulating widely in large swaths of the country. And in recent days,\nwe’ve even seen alarming spikes in other areas, like New York City, that we had hoped had permanently\nsuppressed their infection rates.\nAnd even within this disproportionately hard-hit country, certain communities have suffered more than\nothers. Racial minorities, particularly Black Americans and Hispanics, have been sickened from the\ncoronavirus at a far higher rate than other groups. They have also died at a higher rate. And in the\nensuing economic contraction, they have lost their jobs at a higher rate.\nA virus as contagious, deadly, and frankly as mysterious as COVID-19 was bound to have a significant\neconomic impact. Even before state and local governments took action this spring, many Americans had\nstopped dining out, getting on airplanes, and checking in to hotels. State and local governments then\ncompounded the economic misery when ― and I want to stress that they did so in a responsible\nattempt to protect public health ― they shuttered many businesses deemed nonessential.\nThe upshot? In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. experienced its worst quarterly GDP drop in\nrecorded history when the economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 33 percent. Twenty-two\nmillion jobs evaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were\nhardest hit.\nThe good news is, following that contraction, the economy has rebounded faster than many of us had\nprojected. Stay-at-home orders have been lifted, and though large segments of the economy remain\ndepressed, millions of Americans have returned to their jobs. Indeed, about half of those 22 million\nresidents who were suddenly out of work earlier this year are now back, enough to nudge the\nunemployment rate down from 10.2 percent to 7.9 percent, which is still disastrously high.\nFor now, I expect this recovery to continue, though not fast enough that, by the end of this year, GDP\nwill have returned to where it was before the pandemic struck. In fact, there have been a few recent\nsigns of plateauing, suggesting that a return to the baseline will take quite some time. Segments like\ntourism and hospitality will remain subdued for a long time to come, presenting an overall drag on GDP\n2\n\n\fand employment growth. Employment, unfortunately, probably won’t be back to pre-pandemic levels\nuntil 2023. Last week’s disappointing jobs report underscored how far we have to go.\nI want to caution that this forecast is freighted with uncertainty because, once again, of COVID-19. The\nscenario of continued growth that I have presented depends on a sustained decline in the rate of new\ninfections ― probably a result of nearly universal mask wearing, especially indoors ― that ensures only\nsporadic new outbreaks. We’re also assuming that a vaccine becomes widely available sometime mid to\nlate next year. But COVID-19, as the world has learned all too painfully, is difficult to control. And so, the\npath of the economy largely depends on the path of the virus.\nIt depends in no small part, too, on the path that the federal government chooses to take. My forecasts\nare assuming an additional $1 trillion of fiscal support, which has yet to materialize.\nCOVID-19 and Automation\nFundamentally, this pandemic has had the effect of accelerating trends that were already present in our\nsociety. Categories like department stores were already struggling ― and COVID-19 only served to\nexpedite their obsolescence. Racial minorities like Black Americans were already more likely to be\nunemployed than other groups ― and COVID-19 heightened this yawning disparity.\nSimilarly, trends in labor markets like the increased use of automation are not new. They are simply\nhappening at a more rapid clip since the onset of the pandemic.\nFor decades, the U.S. economy has seen increasing automation in industries spanning manufacturing to\nfood service to office work. But the COVID-19 pandemic has ensured that those transitions are now\noccurring at lightning speed.\nResearchers here at the Philadelphia Fed have been closely studying the effect of the pandemic on labor\nmarkets and automation and have made several key ― if still rather preliminary ― findings. I would like\nto share some with you.\nSome of their findings have been predictable: It turns out that the most automatable jobs are those that\ndo not permit remote work and those that carry a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Obviously,\nmachinery and software are not susceptible to the virus so have often become more attractive options\nthan human workers during the pandemic. Think of meat-packing and slaughterhouse jobs, for example,\nwhich are increasingly automated. Or, closer to home, think of the Pennsylvania Turnpike laying off\nmore than 500 workers this spring as it switched to automatic tolling.\n3\n\n\fOther findings are more surprising and deeply alarming. You might expect that a lot of the jobs that\nwere eliminated because of COVID-19 might come roaring back after the virus passes, for example. But\nthis might not be the case.\nFed researchers have found, based on precedent dating to prior recessions, that, in fact, many of the\njobs that the pandemic eliminated may never return ― even after the virus has passed. They will instead\nbe automated. Those Pennsylvania Turnpike workers were permanently laid off, for instance.\nOur researchers have also found that minority workers are more likely than other groups to hold jobs\nthat could be lost, permanently, to automation. And that leads to the alarming conclusion that\npandemic-induced automation will, as we have in fact seen, only serve to accentuate preexisting\ndisparities in our society.\nWe can’t stop technological progress, of course. But this wave of automation will require each of us to\nthink hard about how we can transition affected workers into new, stable careers filled with\nopportunity.\nCOVID-19 and Algorithms\nThe pandemic likewise has had a profound effect on the algorithmic artificial intelligence that is\nincreasingly used to power large segments of our economy. Algorithms are built on precedent, and so\nit’s little surprise that as COVID-19 caught governments unawares, it also significantly affected their\nability to process what was happening. The algorithms ― like all of us ― had simply never experienced\nthe set of circumstances that COVID-19 presented. And so many algorithms have seen a deterioration in\ntheir performance during this period.\nTake credit scores. One would assume that in a time when 22 million Americans had lost their jobs and\nmillions more Americans had their hours cut that credit scores would have declined. But in fact, the\nopposite happened: Credit scores have, in the aggregate, risen during this period.\nOne reason for this is that, even in this economic downturn, delinquencies are actually down because\nthe aforementioned CARES Act mandated loan forbearance. That was absolutely the right thing to do\nbut led the currently used algorithms to the counterintuitive conclusion that default probabilities have\nin fact decreased.\nAnother consideration going forward will be to ensure that algorithms do not serve to perpetuate the\nkinds of discrimination that we have seen historically in our financial sector. Will machine learning\n4\n\n\fperpetuate long-standing inequities in, for instance, the rate at which certain racial groups are turned\ndown for loans?\nThis issue will require a conversation spanning academic fields ― computer science, law, economics,\nand others.\nAnd it will also require action from not just regulators but probably lawmakers, too, given that many of\nthe laws governing discrimination date back to 1961, when computers couldn’t even fit inside a single\nroom. Conversations like the one we are hosting today hold important implications for the future of our\neconomy ― and making sure that we are building an equitable future for all of us.\nAnd in the meantime, we can rest assured the development of artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning will continue ― though I hope it stops before they figure out a way to replace Fed presidents\nwith robots.\nThank you very much.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning and welcome! Thank you so much for joining us today for this absolutely crucial series of\ndiscussions. And, by the way, it was great to be introduced by my old friend Art and to see him after so\nlong … well, sort of “see” him.\nAs you probably have noticed, we’re meeting under unorthodox circumstances today. But some things\nnever change. One of those is my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nOur Unequal Economy\nWe’re gathered here today to discuss a topic that simply could not be more urgent: building an\nequitable workforce recovery.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the U.S. economy was, in many respects, very healthy.\nUnemployment was low, and GDP growth was humming along steadily. But even then, stresses were\nmounting, inequality was widening, and racial disparities dating back to the founding of our country\npersisted. That has been painfully obvious here in Philadelphia, America’s poorest big city and its largest\nplurality-Black major city.\nEven before the COVID-19 crisis, racial minorities – particularly Black Americans – had higher\nunemployment rates, lower wealth, and poorer health outcomes than White Americans. That was just\nas true across the country as it was here in Philadelphia.\n1\n\n\fAnd just as the virus itself attacks those with preexisting conditions most viciously, the economic effect\nof COVID-19 has been to further accentuate the preexisting conditions that existed in the American\neconomy even before the crisis.\nThe Philadelphia Fed has been conducting extensive research into the economic effects of the\npandemic. The results have been sobering ― if depressingly predictable.\nOur researchers have found that those who have lost their jobs are disproportionately Black and Latino,\ndisproportionately younger, and less likely to have a college degree than other workers.\nAnd even among those who have kept their jobs during this period, those same historically\ndisadvantaged groups are also more likely to work in fields that may put them in harm’s way. Our\nresearchers have also found that workers of color disproportionately hold jobs that one cannot perform\nfrom home, for instance.\nIt’s often said that our current circumstances are the new normal. I refuse to accept that ― a raging\npandemic that is displacing millions of workers and killing around 1,000 Americans a day is anything but\nnormal.\nBut as we begin to map out what our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is going to look like, I also\nwant to make sure that we don’t simply return to the old normal. We need to keep laser focused on\nbuilding a better normal ― one in which growth is shared more equitably and all Americans have an\nopportunity to participate fully in the economy.\nPathways Forward\nSo, how do we do that?\nGiven that I am a Fed president, you probably guessed that I might say monetary policy. And I do think\nthat’s part of the solution. That’s why I’m pleased that, in late August, following a nearly two-year\nreview, the Fed announced a shift in our approach to fulfill our dual mandate of providing for maximum\nemployment and stable prices.\nNo longer will we head off higher inflation by preemptively raising interest rates before we have\nachieved full employment. Moreover, after long periods of sub-2 percent inflation (as we now find\nourselves in), we will accept periods of above-2 percent inflation. Tolerating the risk of slightly higher\ninflation, in our view, is worth it if it helps us achieve our employment goals. That’s important because\n2\n\n\fone of the salutary trends of the pre-COVID economy was that economic gains, at least on a limited\nbasis, were finally being enjoyed by lower-wage workers, a disproportionate percentage of whom are\nracial minorities. We still had a very, very long way to go, of course. But it’s clear that we must achieve\nfull employment to have any hope of beginning to narrow the yawning gaps that bedevil our society.\nAt the local level, we also need to do a better job of transitioning workers into careers that offer solid\npay and strong future prospects. Here at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve been thinking hard about how to\nget workers into what we call opportunity occupations ― that is, jobs that pay the median wage or\nbetter, and that don’t require a college degree.\nI’d like to share the results of just one study we’ve done because I think the results are truly exciting.\nThe study began when Philadelphia Fed researchers, in partnership with the Cleveland Fed, asked a\nquestion: How do we transition workers now in jobs into stable, higher-wage positions?\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of people who are holding those jobs\nand are most at risk of disappearing. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10\npercent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly\nhalf of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring\nsimilar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay\ndifferences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in\nsalary.\nThe opportunities for public‒private partnerships to initiate these kinds of transitions are obvious, and\nI’m proud to say that the Philadelphia Fed helped launch one with Comcast and Philadelphia Works,\nwhich you will hear more about later today.\nThe workers themselves will benefit from these transitions, of course, but so will the employers, who\nwill have access to a vast, untapped pool of human capital. All too often, incredible talent is being\noverlooked because employers are hiring for credentials, like a four-year college degree, over skills. And\nyes, I realize there is irony in a former college president saying this.\nThere are, of course, myriad other barriers to break down. Structural impediments like a lack of access\nto childcare ― another problem only heightened by the pandemic ― or an inability to access broadband\n\n3\n\n\fInternet stand in the way of far too many of our fellow Americans reaching their full economic potential.\nWe need to think hard about how to tear down those walls.\nThere are also large segments of our economy that are starved for capital. Minority-owned small\nbusinesses, for instance, received far fewer emergency loans through the Paycheck Protection Program,\ninitiated at the start of the crisis, than White-owned small businesses. This happened in many cases\nbecause those minority-owned enterprises lacked relationships with banks. We need to think hard\nabout ways to break down those barriers as well.\nBuilding an equitable workforce recovery is not just ― in my view ― a moral necessity, but an economic\none as well. The International Monetary Fund has found that when an additional 1 percent of income\ngoes to the top 20 percent of income earners, GDP falls. But when the same gains are made by the\nbottom 20 percent, GDP rises.\nThat makes sense, of course: Those who earn less money are likely to spend it, whereas high earners\nsave. That’s crucial because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s total\nGDP. And so, the basic idea is this: Get money into the hands of people most likely to spend it, and you’ll\nsee a multiplier effect throughout the broader economy. And that’s why ensuring an equitable recovery\nfrom the COVID-19 crisis is critical in making sure the next expansion is not only fair ― but also strong\nand durable.\nToday, we are excited to officially launch our Equitable Workforce Recovery strategy. As many of you\nknow, three years ago, the Philadelphia Fed launched the Economic Growth & Mobility Project to create\npathways to opportunity across the Third District. Our goal? Leverage our partnerships throughout the\nDistrict to bring research into action. Now, as we look to the country’s coming economic recovery, we\nintend to double down on our work to create equitable growth that benefits all.\nOver the course of the next year, we will be focusing on the issues I outlined here: investing in small\nbusinesses, creating upward mobility for workers, and addressing structural barriers like the digital\ndivide and access to childcare. We are looking forward to continued partnerships across the District\nthrough our Research in Action Labs and conversations like the ones we are having today.\nOur recent research on automation has emphasized the importance of this moment to invest in\nworkers. Many jobs will not be coming back, and preparing workers for the jobs of the future is critical\nto our economic health and recovery. This is why I am excited about the panel that you will hear from\n\n4\n\n\fnext, which could not be timelier. The topic of this discussion will be Building the Jobs of the Future, and\nwe are delighted to be joined by the moderator of this discussion, Uva Coles.\nUva is an expert on issues of workforce diversity and inclusion. She is the founder, president, and CEO of\nInclusiva, LLC, a boutique consulting firm specializing in the development of inclusive workforce\nstrategies. Uva was formerly the assistant vice president of civic and global engagement at Widener\nUniversity in Chester, PA. We will also hear from business leaders on how they are tackling issues of\nequity and opportunity in their respective workplaces.\nSo, without further ado, please welcome Uva Coles and the rest of our esteemed panelists. Thank you.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning from the East Coast of the United States. I know we’re joined by an international\naudience today, so good … well, whatever time it happens to be wherever you are. On behalf of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, I’m sincerely thrilled to welcome you all to this virtual conference.\nThe original plan was for me to greet you in person in our Bank in Philadelphia ― instead I’m in the\nmore cramped confines of my home office here in New Jersey. We’re still planning on having a full-scale\nconference in Philadelphia with our partners from the OMFIF around this time next year, which we’re all\nlooking forward to. So, stay tuned for details on that.\nNow, even though we’re meeting in strange circumstances today, many of the same old rules apply.\nHere is one of them: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nWe’ve gathered today to hear a distinguished panel provide what I’m sure will be a fascinating\ndiscussion on developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning. But before we get to that, I\nwant to set the table by giving you a brief overview of where the economy has been and where it might\nbe heading, recent actions by the Federal Reserve, and a few of my own considerations on machine\nlearning.\n\n1\n\n\fThe State of the Virus\nAll of these topics, of course, have been deeply affected by the same scourge that has kept us physically\napart today: COVID-19.\nSo let’s begin, then, with where we are with the virus. As you well know, still less than a year after\nCOVID-19 first emerged, the virus has infected more than 30 million people around the world and killed\nnearly 1 million.\nThe United States has been particularly hard hit. Because of our country’s unique inability to control the\nvirus, we’ve suffered approximately 21 percent of the world’s deaths, despite housing only about 4\npercent of the world’s population. Infection rates have come down from the highs we saw in the spring\nand summer, but the virus is still circulating widely in large swaths of the country.\nAnd even within this disproportionately hard-hit country, certain communities have suffered more than\nothers. Racial minorities, particularly African Americans and Hispanics, have been sickened from the\ncoronavirus at a far higher rate than other groups. They have also died at a higher rate. And in the\nensuing economic contraction, they have lost their jobs at a higher rate.\nThe State of the Economy\nA virus as contagious, deadly, and frankly as mysterious as COVID-19 was bound to have a significant\neconomic impact. Even before state and local governments took action this spring, many Americans had\nstopped dining out, getting on airplanes, and checking in to hotels. State and local governments then\ncompounded the economic misery when ― and I want to stress, in a responsible attempt to protect\npublic health ― they shuttered many businesses deemed nonessential.\nThe upshot? In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. suffered its worst quarterly GDP drop in\nrecorded history when the economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 33 percent. Twenty-two\nmillion jobs evaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were\nhardest hit.\nThe good news is, following that contraction, the economy has rebounded faster than many of us had\nprojected. Stay-at-home orders have been lifted, and though large segments of the economy remain\ndepressed, millions of Americans have returned to their jobs. Indeed, about half of those 22 million\nresidents who were suddenly out of work earlier this year are now back, enough to nudge the\nunemployment rate down from 10.2 percent to a still-catastrophic 8.4 percent.\n2\n\n\fFor now, I expect this recovery to continue, though not fast enough that, by the end of this year, GDP\nwill have returned to where it was before the pandemic struck. That will take more time. And segments\nlike tourism and hospitality will remain subdued for a long time to come, presenting an overall drag on\nGDP and employment growth. Employment, unfortunately, probably won’t be back to pre-pandemic\nlevels until 2023.\nI want to caution that this forecast is freighted with uncertainty because, once again, of COVID-19. The\nscenario of continued growth that I have presented depends on a sustained decline in the rate of new\ninfections ― probably a result of nearly universal mask-wearing, especially indoors ― that ensures only\nsporadic new outbreaks. We’re also assuming that a vaccine becomes widely available sometime mid to\nlate next year. But COVID-19, as the world has learned all too painfully, is difficult to control. And so the\npath of the economy largely depends on the path of the virus.\nIt depends in no small part, too, on the path that the federal government choses to take. When COVID19 first struck, it brought forth a policy response that, in my view, was commensurate to its gravity. Early\non, Congress provided significant fiscal support for the economy through the CARES Act. That blunted\nthe pain of the contraction. Unfortunately, that relief has now expired, and I would urge lawmakers to\nconsider providing additional support soon.\nThe Role of the Fed\nFor our part, the Federal Reserve’s role in responding to the crisis has been robust. But our main power\nis lending. We cannot simply spend money or issue grants. That is Congress’s role.\nThe Fed’s role in mitigating this crisis has been to use those lending powers to maintain our underlying\neconomic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to liquidity.\nMoreover, our lending facilities are meant as backstops to the private sector. We don’t want to\ndisintermediate the private sector ― we simply want to be there to support market functioning.\nSo, what have we done?\nFirst and foremost, we lowered our policy interest rate to near zero fast and early. We kept this stance\nunchanged at this month’s FOMC meeting and indicated that we plan to keep those rates very low for a\nvery long time.\nIn August, we also announced a long-considered change to how we will balance inflation and\nemployment going forward. Following a nearly two-year review, the Fed announced we will no longer\n3\n\n\fhead off higher inflation by preemptively raising interest rates. Moreover, after long periods of sub-2\npercent inflation ― as we now find ourselves in ― we will accept periods of above-2 percent inflation.\nTolerating the risk of slightly higher inflation, in our view, is worth it if it helps us achieve our\nemployment goals.\nUsing the discount window, we are also actively encouraging banks to borrow money from the Fed at\nultralow interest rates, to make sure they have the funds they need to serve their customers at this\ncritical time.\nIn order to keep markets functioning, beginning in March, we started buying large amounts of Treasury\nbonds and mortgage-backed securities. We have now purchased more than $2 trillion of these products.\nThe markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve slowed the rate of purchases. As a backstop, we have\nalso purchased some corporate debt, and as the economy and credit markets heal, we will disengage\nfrom that market as prudently and as expeditiously as possible.\nBacked by credit protection from the U.S. Treasury, we’ve also launched the Main Street Lending\nProgram, which provides support for small and midsize businesses that were in good financial standing\nbefore the COVID-19 pandemic. The program was recently expanded to include nonprofit organizations,\nsuch as universities and nonprofit medical institutions, which tend to be very important anchor\ninstitutions in their communities.\nThere has been somewhat limited interest in Main Street ― only about 400 banks have registered to\nparticipate in this program. But in a way, that’s actually a good sign for the economy because it means\nthat firms have access to capital without having to use the Fed. Because if you recall, in all of this, we are\nsimply a backstop. On the other hand, if there is another major downturn in the economy, these\nfacilities will still be in place to offer funding.\nWe’re also bolstering the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by\nsupplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those businesses that are receiving\naid through the program.\nPPP is now closed to new applications. But when it was open, it drew a lot of interest. More than 5\nmillion loans were issued to the tune of more than $520 billion. Under our program, the Fed provided\nliquidity to institutions issuing about 17 percent of those loans. This is another positive sign for the\neconomy and the financial sector, as it shows the vast majority of banks have sufficient liquidity to\nextend credit.\n4\n\n\fWe’ve also rolled out a program to help cash-strapped local governments. The Municipal Liquidity\nFacility, whereby we buy bonds from municipalities and states whose tax revenues have collapsed, is\ndesigned to provide essential liquidity as they navigate the twin crises of the pandemic and the\neconomic downturn. The State of Illinois has already tapped this, and we are also opening it to\nmultistate agencies like the Port Authority of New York and other transit authorities. While so far only\nthe State of Illinois has tapped this facility, the Fed by merely announcing its existence did a lot of work\nin getting private markets functioning again.\nMachine Learning\nCOVID-19 has affected everything from health care to tax receipts to tourism. And so, of course, it has\nalso had an impact on the subject of today’s panel discussion: artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning.\nAlgorithms are built on precedent, and so it’s little surprise that as COVID-19 caught governments\nunawares, it also significantly affected the artificial intelligence that is increasingly used to power large\nsegments of our economy. The algorithms ― like all of us ― had simply never experienced the set of\ncircumstances that COVID-19 presented. And so many algorithms have seen a deterioration in their\nperformance during this period.\nTake credit scores. One would assume that in a time when 22 million Americans had lost their jobs and\nmillions more Americans had their hours cut that credit scores would have declined. But in fact, the\nopposite happened: Credit scores have, in the aggregate, risen during this period.\nOne reason for this is that even in this economic downturn, delinquencies are actually down because\nthe aforementioned CARES Act mandated loan forbearance. That was absolutely the right thing to do\nbut lead the currently used algorithms to the counterintuitive conclusion that default probabilities have\nin fact decreased.\nAnother consideration going forward will be to ensure that algorithms do not serve to perpetuate the\nkinds of discrimination that we have seen historically in our financial sector. Will machine learning\nperpetuate long-standing inequities in, for instance, the rate at which certain racial groups are turned\ndown for loans?\nThis issue will require a conversation spanning academic fields ― computer science, law, economics,\nand others. And it will also require action from not just regulators but probably lawmakers, too, given\n5\n\n\fthat many of the laws governing discrimination date back to 1961, when computers couldn’t even fit\ninside a single room. Conversations like the one we are hosting today hold important implications for\nthe future of our economy ― and making sure that we are building an equitable future for all of us.\nAnd in the meantime, we can be rest assured the development of artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning will continue ― though I hope it stops before they figure out a way to replace Fed presidents\nwith robots.\nThank you very much.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fEconomic Outlook and Building an Inclusive Recovery\nThe Center City Proprietors Association\nPhiladelphia, PA (virtual)\nJuly 15, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon, everybody, and thanks to Suzette for that very kind introduction. It’s great to be here\namong such an impressive group of people who care deeply about our city.\nGiven that today’s lunch is virtual, I won’t do the standard thing and urge you to try the salmon and tip\nthe waiters. But I still have to do another standard thing, which is to give you my usual Fed disclaimer:\nThe views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe New Abnormal\nWe’re now about four months into the coronavirus crisis and the onset of what I don’t want to call the\n“new normal.” None of this ― including the fact that we’re meeting virtually today ― is normal.\nOver that period, we went from enjoying strong economic growth, stable prices, and near-record low\nunemployment to a sharp contraction of economic activity and tens of millions of job losses. Meanwhile,\nmore than 130,000 of our fellow citizens across the country have lost their lives to COVID-19 ― and the\nnumber continues to rise each day.\nIt has been a heartbreaking period.\nI was trained as an engineer right here in Philadelphia, and one of my guiding principles has always been\nto trust the science. We’re learning that lesson anew during this period. Despite the enormous sacrifices\nmade by tens of millions of Americans, the country has still failed to control the virus.\n\n1\n\n\fThat is first and foremost a public health crisis. And it’s an economic one, too. A Fed president might like\nto think otherwise, but there is only so much policymakers can do right now to affect the economy. Our\ncountry’s economic performance in a large part depends on what happens with COVID-19.\nThe projections I’m about to share with you, in other words, come with a huge caveat: They’re\nconstantly changing along with the path of the virus. Still, doing a bit of averaging, I can tell you that\nforecasts are suggesting about a negative 20 percent real GDP growth in the first half of this year\nfollowed by a 13 percent growth in the second half. Growth in 2020 would end up at around minus 6\npercent. That’s a much sharper recession than we experienced during the financial crisis.\nNone of this is to suggest that policymakers sit on their hands until the virus passes, of course. Indeed,\nthe pandemic has brought forth a policy response commensurate to its gravity. Congress provided\nsignificant fiscal support for the economy, which has blunted the pain of the contraction.\nFed Actions\nAnd the Federal Reserve’s role in mitigating this crisis has been to use our lending powers to maintain\nour underlying economic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to\nliquidity. Our lending facilities are meant as backstops to the private sector. We don’t want to\ndisintermediate the private sector — we simply want to be there to support market functioning.\nWe’ve done this, first and foremost, by lowering our policy interest rate to near zero fast and early. We\nkept this stance unchanged at last month’s FOMC meeting. As shown by the Survey of Economic\nProjections, almost all my colleagues believe, as do I, that it will be appropriate to maintain the policy\nrate near zero if the economy evolves as expected. Using the discount window, we are also actively\nencouraging banks to borrow money from the Fed at ultra-low interest rates, to make sure they have\nthe funds they need to serve their customers at this critical time.\nIn order to keep markets functioning, beginning in March, we started buying large amounts of Treasury\nbonds and mortgage-backed securities. We have now purchased more than $2 trillion of these products.\nThe markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve slowed the rate of purchases. But we’re not stopping. We\nintend to keep buying about $120 billion worth of Treasury bonds and MBS each month. As a backstop,\nwe have also purchased some corporate debt, and as the economy and credit markets heal, we will\ndisengage from that market as prudently and as expeditiously as possible.\n\n2\n\n\fBacked by credit protection from the U.S. Treasury, we’ve also launched the Main Street Lending\nProgram, which provides support for small and mid-sized businesses that were in good financial standing\nbefore the COVID-19 pandemic. The program opened in June and offers a variety of five-year loans to\nU.S companies employing up to 15,000 workers or with revenues of up to $5 billion, while deferring\nprincipal payments for two years and interest payments for one year. In conjunction with the Treasury,\nwe are also considering ways to broaden the program to include nonprofit organizations, which play a\nvital role in our communities and local economies.\nThere has been somewhat limited interest in Main Street ― only about 400 banks have registered to\nparticipate in this program. But in a way, that’s actually a good sign for the economy because it means\nthat firms have access to capital without having to use the Fed. Because if you recall, in all of this, we are\nsimply a backstop. On the other hand, if there is another major downturn in the economy, these\nfacilities will still be in place to offer funding.\nAt the same time, we’re bolstering the heavily used Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP) by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those businesses\nthat are receiving aid through the program. There has been a lot interest in PPP, with more than 4.5\nmillion loans issued to the tune of more than $520 billion.\nWe’ve also rolled out a program to help cash-strapped local governments. The Municipal Liquidity\nFacility, whereby we buy bonds from municipalities and states whose tax revenues have collapsed, is\ndesigned to provide essential liquidity as they navigate the twin crises of the pandemic and the\neconomic downturn. The State of Illinois has already tapped this, and we are also opening it to\nmultistate agencies like the Port Authority of New York and other transit authorities.\nAn Inclusive Recovery\nWe will recover from this period, and there are already small signs that a rebound is underway. But it\nwill take time. And as the recovery takes shape, I want to make sure that the coming growth is not only\nstrong, but inclusive. It’s worth noting that even though we went into the COVID-19 crisis with a very\nstrong economy, far too many Americans ― disproportionately Americans of color ― were not sharing\nin the country’s prosperity.\n\n3\n\n\fPersonally, I’m serving on the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce’s Regional Recharge and\nRecovery Task Force. Our goal there is to make sure that the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis is not\nonly stronger in terms of growth, but also that it includes more of our fellow citizens.\nThe next period of growth should be strong and more inclusive than the last.\nSo, how do we do ensure that? Our work could include doing things like improving access to credit for\nsmall businesses and especially microenterprises. I don’t need to tell you that small businesses are the\nlifeblood of our communities. In the City of Philadelphia, fully 99.5 percent of businesses have fewer\nthan 500 workers. And of those, 54 percent employ fewer than five workers ― these are\nmicroenterprises.\nMany of these microenterprises don’t have the benefit of established banking relationships ― many\nhave never banked at all. That leaves them at a huge disadvantage, as we saw when many were unable\nto obtain PPP loans. And this is a problem that has disproportionately affected racial minorities and\ncommunities of color.\nTo be sure, there are many historical and structural reasons why so many of our microenterprises\nremain unbanked. But that doesn’t mean this is a status quo we have to accept. As we work toward\nrecovery, we should be thinking about how to tear down the impediments to those microenterprises\nhaving access to the banking system.\nCreating economic and professional mobility is also going to be key in making sure all segments of the\ncountry benefit from the recovery that is coming. Last month, the Philadelphia Fed released a paper that\nprovides an encouraging roadmap for how that might take place, and I’d like to share some of our\nfindings with you.\nFed researchers looked at the skill sets of people in 33 metro areas across the country, including the\nPhiladelphia area, who are holding those jobs that are most at risk of disappearing. They then matched\nthose skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than their current wage and that don’t\nrequire a traditional four-year degree.\nThe bottom line is this: We don’t have to accept that those in at-risk, low-wage jobs will remain so\nforever. Researchers found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one\nhigher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. And the pay differences are significant, with an average\nbump in wages of almost $15,000 ― a 49 percent increase in salary ― for transitions connecting the\n4\n\n\fmost similar occupations identified in the study. Transitioning people into the right new job can mean\nthe difference between a life of poverty and a solid, middle-class standard of living.\nThe possibilities for creative public–private partnerships are very exciting. Transitioning low-wage\nworkers into higher-paying jobs not only helps companies themselves, insofar as they are tapping\nunderutilized human capital, but it also helps redress structural inequities. Communities of color stand\nto benefit because they have for far too long and far too often been shut out of higher wage work.\nAt the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve helped launch just such a program, working in partnership with Comcast\nand Philadelphia Works, our local workforce investment board. Philadelphia Works provides upfront\ninvestment in a pilot job-training program for Comcast. Comcast then pays for outcomes once they are\nachieved, such as staying on the job for over six months. It’s a tremendous example of what thoughtful\npublic–private partnerships can accomplish. We can’t push this all on the public sector, which, especially\nnow, doesn’t have the bandwidth or the money. But intelligent public–private partnerships could be a\nvery promising way forward.\nRather than staying stuck in this new normal or moving back to the old normal, I am confident that\ntogether we can forge a better future ― a better normal, perhaps ― for all of us. Thank you.\nAnd now, I’m happy to take some questions.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fThe Impact of COVID-19 on Communities and Small Businesses\nFederal Reserve Connecting Communities\n(a webinar hosted by the Federal Reserve System)\nJuly 14, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello, everybody, and thank you to Matuschka for that introduction. This is a very important discussion,\nand I’m thrilled to be joined by so many of you.\nBut before we begin that very important discussion, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The\nviews I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nSmall Businesses in the Economy and Our Communities\nIn one sense, it’s gratifying that there is so much interest in the Fed’s COVID-19 Community Impact\nSurvey and the economic effects of the virus more generally.\nBut the strong turnout today is also evidence that months after the coronavirus arrived on our shores\nand shut down vast swaths of the economy, we remain mired in a crisis the likes of which none of us has\never experienced.\nIndeed, even as the economy is reopening in fits and starts, the pandemic’s effects are proving not to be\njust a brief setback. We are in a downturn that is both exceptionally painful and stubbornly long-lasting.\nAmong those most affected by this crisis have been those small businesses across the country that are\nthe lifeblood of our economy ― and of so many of our own communities.\nSmall businesses define the landscape of our cities and towns. Small business owners and their\nemployees are our neighbors, our friends, and oftentimes our family members. They’re our plumbers,\nour grocers, and our barbers. (Though during the COVID-19 shutdown, some of us have become\namateur barbers ourselves.)\n1\n\n\fSmall businesses also define our economic landscape. The United States certainly boasts more than its\nfair share of corporate titans ― American companies make up for more than a fifth of the Fortune\nGlobal 500 ― but small businesses are integral to our economy and to the functioning of the labor force.\nAccording to the Small Business Administration, as of 2018, there were more than 30 million American\nsmall businesses, employing nearly 60 million people. That means that nearly half of the country’s\nprivate workforce is employed by small businesses. Small businesses are also an engine for building a\nmore racially equitable economy: More than 8 million small businesses are owned by racial minorities.\nAmong small businesses, microenterprises ― those employing fewer than five people ― predominate.\nNationally, some 59 percent of businesses are microenterprises. Here in the Third District, we are\nparticularly sensitive to the concerns of these vital businesses.\nIn the City of Philadelphia, fully 99.5 percent of businesses are small businesses, meaning they employ\nfewer than 500 people. And of those, 54 percent employ fewer than five.\nSmall Business and the Pandemic\nWhen the COVID-19 crisis hit, the economy was in quite good shape. But even then, many of our small\nbusinesses, especially those helmed by racial and ethnic minorities, faced a precarious existence.\nAccording to Fed research, at the end of 2019, smaller firms, younger firms, and firms owned by Blacks\nor Latinos were more likely to be classified as “at risk” or “distressed” than other businesses.\nAnd even those firms deemed financially healthy were often on a knife’s edge. Late last year, the Fed\nfound that only 1 in 5 healthy small businesses ― and of course, far fewer less-healthy firms ― had\nsufficient cash reserves to continue normal operations if they experienced a two-month revenue loss. A\nmajority of small businesses of any level of health would be likely to reduce their workforce and\noperations, or delay payments, we found. Many firms would rely on personal funds or debt to bridge the\ngap.\nAnd some said they would try to sell or close their businesses altogether.\nSo while it’s tragic news, it ultimately isn’t surprising that small businesses owned by minorities have\nbeen disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisis.\nWhen we think about the challenges these businesses have historically faced as a result of the racial\nwealth gap, it becomes more understandable why minority-owned businesses are in the most\n2\n\n\fprecarious financial situations. Just recently, the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the\nnumber of Black-owned small businesses nationwide has collapsed by a stunning 41 percent since the\nonset of the coronavirus crisis.\nAnd at the Philadelphia Fed, our research has found that the disproportionate impact does not just fall\non minorities who own small businesses, but among those who work for them as well.\nThose who have lost jobs within small businesses because of the COVID-19 pandemic have been\ndisproportionately young, disproportionately less educated, and are more likely to be a member of a\nracial or ethnic minority. Compounding the tragedy is the fact that racial minorities have also been\ndisproportionately affected by the disease itself, with Blacks and Latinos in particular suffering from\nhigher death rates than other groups.\nSmall Business and Banking\nBack in March, Congress passed the CARES Act, which included the Paycheck Protection Program, or\nPPP. PPP was designed so that small businesses could obtain largely forgivable loans if they kept workers\non their payroll through the crisis.\nThere is no doubt that PPP was an immense help to millions of businesses and that the employment\ncrisis would be far worse without it. PPP has proven to be something of a blunt instrument, however.\nFed researchers have found, for instance, no direct correlation between the disbursement of PPP loans\nand the level of infection in a given area. The State of Nebraska, for example, which has been left\nrelatively unscathed by the coronavirus, has a far higher rate of small businesses receiving PPP loans\nthan those in hard-hit New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\nI think a big part of the problem is that the distribution of PPP loans was predicated on having existing\nbanking relationships. Basically, small businesses went to the bank they had borrowed from before in\norder to get a PPP loan.\nThe trouble is that many small businesses, especially those microenterprises we’ve been talking about,\ndon’t have those established banking relationships ― many have never banked at all. And so, when PPP\nloans became available, these business owners had no ability to access them. This is a problem that has\ndisproportionately affected racial minorities and communities of color.\nThere are many historical and structural reasons why so many of our microenterprises remain\nunbanked. But that doesn’t mean that this is a status quo we have to accept. This is why we launched a\n3\n\n\fseries on equity in recovery: identifying those who are most at risk and putting them at the center of our\nwork.\nAcross the System, something we should all be thinking about is this: How do we solve this problem?\nWhat are the existing impediments to those microenterprises having access to the banking system? How\ncan we harness our country’s CDFIs, large banks and community banks, and even microloan financiers\nand other financial institutions to serve our under-resourced communities and entrepreneurs?\nThis isn’t just a problem to be diagnosed ― it’s one to work together to solve.\nI’ve said many times that I refuse to call this current period of crisis “the new normal.” None of this is\nnormal. But that doesn’t mean that when the COVID-19 pandemic passes that we are destined to go\nback to the old normal. Together, we can chart our way to a “better normal” ― and discussions like\nthese are going to be a part of that important task.\nThank you, again, and now I’m happy to take some questions.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning and thanks so much for that introduction, Andrea. It’s great to be back among friends\nand fellow chamber members … at least in some form.\nWe may be meeting in unusual circumstances today, but I still need to give you the usual Fed disclaimer:\nThe views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe New Abnormal\nIt’s now been more than three months since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis and the beginning of what\nI don’t want to call the “new normal.” None of this — including the fact that we are meeting today\nvirtually — is normal.\nOver that period, we went from enjoying strong economic growth, stable prices, and near-record low\nunemployment to a sharp contraction of economic activity and tens of millions of job losses. Here in the\nregion that the chamber covers, the unemployment rate shot from 5 percent to more than 15 percent.\nMeanwhile, more than 115,000 of our fellow citizens across the country have lost their lives to COVID19 — and the number continues to rise each day.\nIt has been a heartbreaking period.\nGus Faucher will give you a more granular look at the local economy in a moment, but on the national\nlevel, I can tell you I expect 2020 to show a sharp recession; 2021 will be a growth year, with GDP and\nemployment picking up, though not enough to return the economy to where it was at the beginning of\n\n1\n\n\fthis year. All of this, of course, is quite uncertain, depending in a large part on how the virus continues to\nmove through our society.\nFed Actions\nThe Federal Reserve’s role in mitigating this crisis has been to use our lending powers to maintain our\nunderlying economic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to\nliquidity. Our lending facilities are meant as backstops to the private sector. We don’t want to\ndisintermediate the private sector — we simply want to be there to support market functioning.\nSo, what have we done?\nFirst and foremost, we have lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, a stance we decided to keep\nunchanged at last week’s FOMC meeting. We intend to keep the rate near zero for the foreseeable\nfuture, possibly through 2022.\nIn order to keep credit flowing, beginning in March, we began buying large amounts of Treasury bonds\nand mortgage-backed securities. We have now purchased more than $2 trillion of these products. The\nmarkets have largely stabilized, and we’ve slowed the rate of purchases. But we’re not stopping. We\nintend to keep buying about $120 billion worth of Treasury bonds and MBS each month.\nWe’ve also rolled out a program to help cash-strapped local governments. The Municipal Liquidity\nFacility, whereby we buy bonds from municipalities and states whose tax revenues have collapsed, is\ndesigned to provide essential liquidity as they navigate the twin crises of the pandemic and the\neconomic downturn. Earlier this month, we had our first taker, with the State of Illinois tapping the\nprogram for $1.2 billion.\nWe’ve also been working hard on launching our Main Street Lending Program, which is designed to get\ncash into the hands of small- to medium-sized businesses whose operations have been hampered by\nCOVID-19 and the shutdowns. Since announcing the facility, we’ve heard a lot of feedback from\nbusinesses across the country, and we’ve recently adjusted the program so organizations can take\nsmaller loans — even as small as $250,000 — and take a little longer to pay them back. We intend to\nlaunch this program in the coming days. We view it as vitally important in providing a backstop to those\nsmall- and medium-sized businesses that are — I don’t need to tell you — the lifeblood of the U.S.\neconomy.\n\n2\n\n\fFor the same reason, we have also bolstered the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection\nProgram by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those businesses that are\nreceiving aid through the program.\nAmerican Unrest\nNow, I want to switch gears a bit and address something that I’m sure has been on all of your minds.\nIn recent weeks, millions of Americans have raised their voices to demand social justice and racial\nequality. The protests may have begun as a result of the horrifying death of George Floyd in\nMinneapolis, but they quickly evolved into a broader demand for our country to finally rid itself of the\nscourge of racism and inequality. The Federal Reserve takes those demands seriously, and we are fully\ncommitted to building a culture of inclusion throughout our System.\nAt the Philadelphia Fed specifically, based as it is in the poorest big city in America, we’ve placed a\nparticular focus on equity and opportunity. Our Community Development and Regional Outreach\nDepartment operates the Economic Growth & Mobility Project. This is a multilevel effort to bring\nentrepreneurial solutions to achieve inclusive economic growth and to create pathways out of poverty\nthrough the pillars of creating job opportunities, improving human capital, and addressing housing and\nother infrastructure needs.\nOur Bank’s focus on workforce development is particularly relevant at this moment, given that some of\nthe jobs that have been lost because of the COVID-19 crisis may never return. Others, even when they\ndo come back, will do so in a radically different form, thanks to the rapid technological shifts in the\nworkplace that the pandemic is only accelerating. Our research has shown that those most at risk for\nCOVID-19‒related job loss tend to be disproportionately young, low income, and from a racial minority.\nCreating economic and professional mobility is going to be key in making sure all segments of the\ncountry benefit from the recovery that is eventually coming. And I’m happy to announce that just today\nthe Philadelphia Fed is releasing a new paper that provides an encouraging roadmap for how that might\ntake place. You can read it on our website.\nFed economists looked at the skill sets of people in 33 metro areas across the country, including the\nPhiladelphia area, who are holding those jobs that are most at risk of disappearing. They then matched\nthose skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than their current wage and that don’t\nrequire a traditional four-year degree.\n3\n\n\fThe bottom line is this: We don’t have to accept that those in at-risk, low-wage jobs will remain so\nforever. The researchers found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least\none higher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. And the pay differences are significant, with an\naverage bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in salary. Transitioning people into\nthe right new job can mean the difference between a life of poverty and a solid, middle-class standard of\nliving.\nThe possibilities for creative public-private partnerships are very exciting. Transitioning low-wage\nworkers into higher-paying jobs not only helps companies themselves, insofar as they are tapping\nunderutilized human capital, but it also helps redress structural inequities. Communities of color stand\nto benefit because they have for far too long and far too often been shut out of higher wage work.\nAt the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve helped launch just such a program, working in partnership with Comcast\nand Philadelphia Works, our local workforce investment board. Philadelphia Works provides upfront\ninvestment in a pilot job training program for Comcast. Comcast then pays for outcomes once they are\nachieved, such as staying on the job for over six months. It’s a tremendous example of what thoughtful\npublic-private partnerships can accomplish.\nRather than staying stuck in this new normal or moving back to the old normal, in other words, I am\nconfident that together we can forge a better future — a better normal, perhaps — for all of us. Thank\nyou.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you very much to Daniel for that introduction and a big thank you to everybody\nat both the Philadelphia and St. Louis Federal Reserve Banks who worked tirelessly to make this virtual\nevent possible. We usually hold these biennial Reinventing Our Communities conferences in\nPhiladelphia, though two years ago we met in Baltimore for the first time. Back then, we thought that\nwas a big change! Little did we know …\nNow, we may be meeting in a very different format this year, but I still have to begin by mentioning my\nusual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has certainly changed America in the course of just a few months. Many of us have\nbecome expert “social distancers” and furious handwashers. Some of us have even become amateur\nbarbers.\nBut in other important ways, this health crisis has not so much changed things as simply exposed, and in\nsome cases accelerated, trends that were already present in our society.\nThe United States went into this crisis a troublingly unequal place, beset by serious inequities in income,\nwealth, and opportunity.\nPerhaps most disturbing is that the multiyear economic expansion we experienced through much of the\nlast decade did nothing to reduce American inequality. Indeed, last year, even as by many measures, the\neconomy was in great shape, the Census Bureau calculated that income inequality in 2018 was the\nhighest it had been in the 50 years it has measured it. The Gini coefficient — which measures the\nequality of income distribution — shows that incomes in the U.S. are far less equally distributed than in\nother industrialized countries like Germany and Japan.\n1\n\n\fWealth inequality is even starker.\nMy colleagues at the St. Louis Fed calculated last year that, as of 2016, the top 10 percent of wealthiest\nAmerican households owned 77 percent of the country’s total wealth. The bottom 50 percent owned\nonly 1 percent. Fully 10 percent of American households had negative net worth, meaning their total\nhousehold debt outstripped their assets.\nInequality and poverty touch all corners of America, from depopulating rural communities in the Great\nPlains, to postindustrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest, to neighborhoods in even some of our\nwealthiest cities like San Francisco and New York. But we can’t deny that certain communities have\nborne the brunt of these inequities more than others. It’s simply a fact that some of the underlying\ninequalities in our society deal with race. To cite just one example, as of 2016, the average family wealth\nof white families was nearly seven times greater than that of black families.\nThe health crisis has only heightened these inequities. For one, the coronavirus itself is affecting some\ncommunities more than others. In Philadelphia, more than half of those who have died from COVID-19\nhave been African American, despite African Americans making up only about 40 percent of the city’s\npopulation. This is a trend that has been observable nationwide.\nAnd the economic costs of the health crisis have fallen on those least able to bear them as well.\nOur researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been studying closely which neighborhoods and\nhouseholds have been most affected by the economic shutdown. They’ve found that those most likely\nto be at risk of losing employment were already disproportionately low income.\nIn other words, both as a health and an economic crisis, COVID-19 has the cruel effect of hurting those\nwho were already most vulnerable.\nAmerican inequality is a moral and ethical challenge to our country’s founding creed. But research\nshows it’s also a growing economic problem. The International Monetary Fund has found that when an\nadditional 1 percent of income goes to the top 20 percent of income earners, GDP falls. But when the\nsame gains are made by the bottom 20 percent, GDP rises.\nThat makes sense, of course: Those who earn less money are likely to spend it, whereas high earners\nsave. That’s crucial because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s total\nGDP. Ensuring an equitable recovery from COVID-19 is critical in making sure the next expansion is not\nonly fair but also strong and durable.\n2\n\n\fThat’s why today’s discussion is so vitally important. Our role at the Fed is not to dictate fiscal policy but\nto use our academic and applied research, our outreach, and our convening powers to help\npolicymakers all across the country better understand how to deal with these challenges.\nHere at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve launched the Economic Growth & Mobility Project, a multilevel\neffort to bring entrepreneurial solutions to achieve inclusive economic growth and create pathways out\nof poverty through the pillars of creating job opportunities, improving human capital, and addressing\nhousing and infrastructure needs.\nAs this crisis continues, we must redouble our efforts to redress some of the great underlying challenges\nto our society. Thank you very much for being a part of this extremely important conversation.\n\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fEconomic Outlook Amid COVID-19\nChicago Council on Global Affairs\nChicago, IL (via Zoom)\nMay 7, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for having me here today … in some form …\nBefore we begin, let me dispense with the usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nIt’s no secret that we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis like none of us have experienced in our\nlifetimes. The coronavirus that arrived on our shores just a few months ago has already killed tens of\nthousands of Americans, ended a years-long streak of solid economic growth, and caused tens of\nmillions of our fellow citizens to lose their jobs.\nIt’s amazing to think how different my remarks would have been had I given them just two months ago.\nAppreciation for the Frontline Workers\nThe coronavirus is above all a public health crisis and the Federal Reserve as an institution — and me\npersonally — can’t say enough to adequately convey our gratitude toward America’s health-care\nworkers, as well as other frontline workers like police, grocery-store workers, truck drivers, and\ninnumerable others who are risking their own health for the well-being of the country.\nThe economic ramifications of this crisis, of course, have been stark as well.\nPerhaps most notable has been a collapse in most forms of consumer spending, a component of GDP\nthat accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s economic activity.\nIn March, we experienced a literally unprecedented 7.5 percent fall in consumer spending, and April\ndata will surely be even worse. In the same month, manufacturing output fell to levels not seen since\n2011. And data from the Institute for Supply Management showed a stark contraction for April as well.\n1\n\n\fIt’s notable that this diminution, particularly on the consumer side, was observable even before states\ntook serious action to curtail the spread of the virus. That strongly suggests that the coronavirus itself,\nand not just government policies designed to mitigate it, are harming the economy.\nBefore states and cities started imposing lockdowns and shutting down businesses they deemed\nnonessential, data show the cutbacks in spending: Airline bookings were collapsing and foot traffic into\nrestaurants had already begun a steep decline, to name just a few examples of weakening consumption\ndemand in some categories of goods and services. Consumers were voting with their feet — or at least\nwith their wallets.\nEven my presence here by Zoom is evidence that it isn’t only government mandates that have slowed\nthe economy. It was a decision we took ourselves, to stay home and to stay safe.\nThe point is this: Until the virus itself is under control, even as more states gradually open up, we can\nexpect the economy to underperform relative to where it was just a couple of months ago.\nDoes that mean we should simply sit on our hands until effective therapies, or a vaccine, emerges? Of\ncourse not. And as you probably know, our institution, the Federal Reserve, has taken bold action to\nhelp deal with the economic consequences of what is fundamentally a public health crisis.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have essentially found ourselves in the role of firefighter — and we’ve\npoured water on the fire. But we want to avoid damaging the underlying infrastructure of what just a\nfew months ago was a very healthy economy.\nAccess to Liquidity for All\nOur goal is to use our vast lending powers to maintain our underlying economic infrastructure by making\nsure that every sector of the economy has access to liquidity. I realize that more needs to be done, that\npeople and firms will need infusions of cash, and that all of this is occurring at an unprecedented pace.\nBut that is a role for the federal government. Working together, we can try to ensure that the necessary\nconditions for a recovery will be there when this health crisis has passed.\nRegarding Federal Reserve actions, we have, first and foremost, acted by lowering our policy interest\nrate to near zero — and we expect to keep it there for some time.\nWe’ve also taken a number of actions to keep credit flowing. Beginning in March, as the depths of the\ncrisis became apparent, we started buying large amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed\n2\n\n\fsecurities to prevent credit markets from seizing up. The markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve now\nslowed the rate of those purchases.\nWe’re also focusing on using all of our available tools to get loans directly into the hands of those who\nneed them most.\nTo do that, we’re going to be buying bonds from cities and states, most of whose sales tax revenues\nhave tanked along with consumer spending. This program, called the Municipal Liquidity Facility, will\nprovide essential liquidity to local governments as they fight the pandemic.\nWe’ve also set up what we’re calling our Main Street Lending facility. The goal here is to get cash in the\nhands of small- to medium-sized businesses whose operations have been hampered by the virus. These\nbusinesses tend to be the economic lifeblood of their local communities, and this lending facility is\ndesigned to forestall mass closures of small and medium-sized businesses on Main Streets across the\ncountry.\nRelatedly, the Federal Reserve is also bolstering the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection\nProgram by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those crucial businesses.\nStress on Higher Education\nWe know that this crisis is severely harming the nonprofit sector as well. As a recovering academic and\nuniversity president myself, I’m acutely aware of the stress this crisis is inflicting on, for instance, the\nhigher education sector. The Federal Reserve is thinking carefully about setting up facilities that can\nprovide direct lending to colleges, universities, and nonprofit medical institutions.\nI want to be clear. We’re not in 2009 anymore and this is not quantitative easing 2.0. The principle\nbehind quantitative easing was that people weren’t engaging in investments because the cost of capital\nwas too high.\nThat is simply not the case now. The reason people aren’t engaging economically is the health crisis.\nI also want to be clear that these facilities — as well as the actions that have been taken on the fiscal\nside, especially the CARES Act that Congress passed a few weeks ago — are not economic stimulus.\nThere may be a time for stimulus later, after the acute phase of the health crisis has passed.\nOur facilities, instead, are a form of emergency relief — of insurance. We’re doing everything we can to\nhelp people get through a really painful time.\n3\n\n\fSo, now the $64,000, or perhaps the $22 trillion, question. What happens next economically?\nThe second quarter data will be brutally painful as a result of both the virus and the governmentmandated economic shutdown. Take your pick of bad, really bad, or really, really bad.\nWhat happens after that to a large extent depends on how the virus moves through our society, and our\nreaction to it in terms of balancing stay-at-home policies versus an intelligent — and I want to stress,\nintelligent — reopening.\nThe Economy: Possible Paths\nThere are multiple scenarios as to how this plays out. But here are just two to consider: In the more\noptimistic scenario, the economy largely opens in June, we have technology in place to contain the\nspread of the virus, and there is no second wave in the fall. In that scenario, I would expect a severe\ncontraction in GDP in the second quarter followed by a significant rebound in the second half. However,\nthe second half rebound is not enough to fully offset the contraction in Q1 and Q2; 2021 would then\nshow above-trend annual GDP growth.\nThe less optimistic scenario is that we open too quickly and see a significant second wave of the virus.\nNot only would this be a health catastrophe, but it would reverse the recovery as well. In this less\nhopeful scenario, I project a similar growth path to the baseline for 2020, followed by a painful\neconomic contraction of GDP in 2021 as shutdowns are reintroduced.\nLonger term, of course, there will be a recovery. But I also want to stress that it might be an uneven one.\nThere’s an old saying that a rising tide lifts all boats. But that might not apply here.\nManufacturers of durable goods, for instance, should come back quickly.\nOne large manufacturer in our District who temporarily halted operations reports that orders\nthemselves never evaporated — they were simply delayed as virus mitigation measures took effect. But\nas Pennsylvania and other industrial states slowly and intelligently reopen, I think we can expect\nmanufacturing output to quickly bounce back.\nTravel and hospitality, on the other hand, may be in for a longer and more painful contraction.\nBusinesses may have enough experience teleconferencing instead of holding physical meetings that they\nmay decide to cut back on corporate travel. Families may choose to avoid crowded spots like\n\n4\n\n\famusement parks and cruise ships. The knock-on effects to airlines, hotels, and restaurants that cater to\ntravelers could be severe and long-lasting.\nCommercial real estate could also suffer for similar reasons.\nCompanies may find that working from home isn’t so bad after all and reduce physical office space.\nThere is also a strong possibility that many hotels and restaurants will never reopen. There will probably\nbe retailers, big and small, that also shutter permanently.\nIn the long term, the uneven recovery will present a risk to our banking sector, which is heavily exposed\nto sectors like commercial real estate. The good news is we went into this crisis with a well-capitalized\nregulated financial system. But I want to urge banks to retain capital as we prepare to enter a tough\nperiod. In my personal opinion, they probably shouldn’t be issuing large dividends at the moment.\nI want to close by mentioning a subject dear to my heart: diners!\nNear my house in South Jersey there’s a diner that, just a few days after restaurants were shut down\nhere, quickly turned into a full-service grocery store. Now perhaps this only demonstrates the ingenuity\nof the South Jersey diner sector. And I’ll admit I’m biased on that score …\nBut I also think it underlines Americans’ boundless ability to adapt — to retool when the times call for it.\nI’m sure that we will get through this.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon, and it is a pleasure to be here with you and to also be back on my old stomping\ngrounds of the University of Delaware. Being here again feels like Groundhog Day — but without Sonny\nand Cher singing on the radio.\nAnother thing that feels like Groundhog Day is the usual disclaimer I say over and over again: The views I\nexpress today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or across the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that out of the way, let me outline my remarks today. I will start with my outlook for the economy\n— which I know takes on greater significance since I am a voting member this year of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. My outlook for the economy — specifically for the labor market — ties into the final\nsection of my speech: workforce development. In my view, with the labor market the tightest it has\nbeen in decades, now is the time to create new approaches to how companies hire, train, and retain\nemployees and how the U.S. can create career paths for all of its workers.\nEconomic Outlook\nLet’s start with the economy. Overall, I think the economy is in good shape.\nWe are in the longest economic expansion on record, and I see growth returning to trend of about 2\npercent this year, a view that is widely shared.\nFriday’s employment report showed the labor market began 2020 on the same positive trend it showed\nthrough 2019. We added 225,000 net new jobs in January — better than the monthly average of\n\n1\n\n\f175,000 for all of 2019. Hourly wages increased 3.1 percent from last January, and the unemployment\nrate stood at 3.6 percent.\nAt some point, we’ll return to a trend of creating about 100,000 net new jobs per month. That number\nsounds disappointing — compared with the stronger monthly gains we’ve seen in recent years. But it’s\nimportant to recognize that 100,000 jobs per month is more than enough to keep pace with the\nexpected growth in the U.S. labor force. That’s one reason why I expect that the unemployment rate will\nstay below 4 percent for the next couple of years.\nThe health of the labor market, especially when it comes to paychecks, is key to my economic outlook\nsince consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. The news in general\ncontinues to be good for the consumer sector. Thanks to the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years and\ngrowth in wages, consumers are upbeat about the economy. Consumer confidence is high, and the\noptimism should support household spending this year.\nAnother support to consumer spending this year is the prospect of more homeowners refinancing their\nmortgages. Research done at the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute 1 shows that lower rates\nin 2019 resulted in a large number of borrowers who are in a position to refinance their residential\nmortgages. Mortgage refinancing fuels consumption in two ways: First, homeowners are able to lower\ntheir monthly house payment, freeing up money that can be spent elsewhere. Second, homeowners\nmay choose to extract some home equity by using a cash-out refinance. This also provides money for\nother consumer spending.\nOur research shows that in September 2019 — when the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 3.61\npercent — about 19 percent of all active mortgages were refi candidates. The Bank’s research —\nsupported by industry analysis — suggests that with no change in mortgage rates, about 60 percent of\nborrowers will probably refinance this year, and over the next two years, we would expect an estimated\n$11.2 billion in added consumption from this refi activity. On an individual level, an average homeowner\nwould have about $2,000 to spend in extra consumption within the first year after refinancing — a nice\nlift to almost any budget.\nMy positive view about the consumer contrasts with concerns about business investment. Spending on\nnew plant and equipment and intellectual property is lagging, and the uncertainty attached to fiscal and\n\n1\n\nThe analysis is based on Black Knight McDash data and Equifax Credit Risk Insight Servicing data.\n\n2\n\n\fother policies has continued to hold spending back. So, too, have international developments, including\nthe global slowdown, trade uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions.\nIt’s too early to say what impact the spread of the coronavirus will have on the global economy, but the\nnegative effects on the Chinese economy and international travel are something to watch.\nThat’s my view on the labor markets and economic growth. Let me talk about the other side of the Fed’s\ndual mandate: inflation. We haven’t quite met our 2 percent inflation target, but we’re on track to get\nthere. While the process has been a slow one, I still believe that the inflation rate will rise to meet our\ngoal.\nAgainst this backdrop of a generally positive economic outlook and expectations that inflation will\neventually hit the Fed’s target, I come to the part that everyone really cares about: rates. As you know,\nat the January FOMC meeting, the Committee decided unanimously to hold the federal funds rate target\nstable at the range of 1½ to 1¾ percent.\nMy own view right now is that we should hold steady for a while and watch how developments and the\ndata unfold before taking any more action.\nThe Regional Economy\nTurning to Delaware and the Philadelphia region, the economic outlook is more mixed than the national\none. Over the past five years, Delaware employment grew less than 1 percent per year, which is lower\nthan the 1.5 percent posted for the nation. In the recent months, however, Delaware’s job growth has\npicked up to a rate similar to the national average. At a more granular level, northern parts of Delaware\nseem to be doing better than the southern parts.\nDelaware’s unemployment rate was 3.9 percent in December (slightly higher than the national figure).\nUnemployment in the southern areas tends to be higher.\nDelaware’s job growth has been reasonably broad based, with the usual suspects such as the financial\nindustry and education and health care — often referred to as “Eds and Meds” — leading the way. The\nprofessional and business services sector has seen a slight decline in the past year. But this could be due\nto a reduction in temporary-service jobs, which show up in the business services sector. With the local\nlabor market remaining tight, companies are shifting temporary and part-time workers into permanent,\nfull-time jobs, which results in a reduction of employment in the professional and business services\nsector.\n3\n\n\fIn the Philadelphia metro area, which, of course, encompasses parts of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New\nJersey, and Maryland, job growth had been running around 1.5 percent, until several years ago when it\nslowed to 1 percent annually. In general, the Philadelphia metro area’s job growth since the last\nrecession has outpaced that of the Pennsylvania average for the most part, but has been below that of\nthe nation during the same period.\nLike Delaware, the Philadelphia metro area’s job growth has been consistently broad based for the past\nseveral years, thanks to net new job gains in Eds and Meds and professional and business services. The\nlocal labor market is also feeling the direct impact of e-commerce versus brick-and-mortar stores. We\nhave had a decline in retail employment, but we are seeing continuous growth in transportation and\nwarehousing employment.\nAs for the jobless rate, the Philadelphia area’s rate stood at 4.1 percent in December. This is lower than\nthe state average but is higher than the national average. In recent months, we have seen a slight uptick\nin the region’s and the state’s unemployment rates. This is likely due to an increase in the labor force\nparticipation rate at the state level during the same period. As more people enter the labor force, the\nunemployment rate will temporarily increase until they find jobs.\nTight Labor Market Could Be a Workforce Development Opportunity\nThe very tight labor markets we are seeing locally and across the nation have put employers in a\nchallenging position that was not evident in the years following the Great Recession. Companies report\ndifficulty filling open positions, and many of those slots stay vacant for a long time. The difficult\nrecruiting environment is also one that is likely to stay with us for some time as demographic trends\nindicate that the workforce will continue to age and the labor force relative to the population will\ncontinue to decline.\nThis challenge may also be viewed as an opportunity, and those that successfully invent new ways to\nattract workers will enhance their chances of success. Now is a chance to rethink the same-old, sameold ways of building a productive workforce. This can perhaps be done by rethinking job requirements\nor additional ways of training.\nOne such innovative program has begun in Philadelphia. It is a public–private partnership to train\nworkers here in Philadelphia. This project was developed by the Bank’s Economic Growth & Mobility\nProject, in concert with Philadelphia Works and Comcast. It seeks to gain a better understanding of what\n\n4\n\n\fprograms and strategies expand opportunities for individuals who live in low- and moderate-income\ncommunities.\nThe pilot program, announced last fall, has Philadelphia Works providing the upfront investment for\ntraining workers to master the skills needed by Comcast. As part of this new financial model, Comcast is\ncommitted to paying for outcomes once they are achieved, such as staying on the job for over six\nmonths. Philadelphia Works provides the training. The model also creates a better feedback loop\nbetween employers and the workforce board to make the program more effective and responsive to\nchanging employer and employee needs.\nThe program is helping Comcast find workers in a tight labor market and let me assure you: The tight\nlabor market we hear about from most of you is not imagined. Economists at the Philadelphia Fed have\nbeen looking into the amount of time needed to fill positions in metro areas across the U.S. In our\nregion, it took 41 days, on average, to fill a position. That was longer than the national average of 37\ndays, and put Philly 47th out of the 50 largest metro areas.\nIt is hard to say exactly why it takes longer in Philadelphia than in other places, but one thing our\nresearchers noted is that job ads in the Philadelphia metro area tend to list slightly higher education\nrequirements than other metro areas. This underscores a need to switch gears and investigate if\nprograms such as the one I just mentioned could be adapted to the challenges you face.\nBut here’s another finding of the study that I found very interesting: The skills in highest demand in the\nPhiladelphia region, and across the U.S., are not those dependent on acquiring a four-year degree, but\ninstead are soft skills, such as communication, customer service, and teamwork. That could indicate that\na rethinking of job requirements could help counter the tight labor market conditions that are a\nprevalent feature of the current economy. Sometimes that means a college or graduate degree is\nneeded, but sometimes it doesn’t.\nThat leads to another issue about workforce development, an issue I have championed for a few years\nnow. And it might be strange to hear this from me — a former president here at the University of\nDelaware — but not every high school graduate needs to go to college. And that would be even truer if\nthere were greater innovation in recruiting and training. To reiterate, the difficulty of finding new\nemployees is likely to be a feature of the labor market for some time to come because demographic\ntrends are not short-run fluctuations. Innovation in attracting and retaining workers is likely to be one of\n\n5\n\n\fthe key aspects governing success. It expands the pool of workers, helping to create better matches and\na more productive workforce. And, importantly it opens pathways for workers.\nOpportunity Occupations\nOf course, workers without a college degree still need to find well-paying jobs. As I mentioned earlier,\nmy positive outlook for the U.S. economy rests on the consumer sector. We need everyone who wants a\njob to be able to find a well-paying and sustainable career path. Researchers within our Community\nDevelopment and Regional Outreach Department have identified several employment categories that\npay above the national annual median wage but do not require a four-year college degree. We call these\nopportunity occupations.\nMy colleague Keith Wardrip worked with researchers from the Cleveland Fed to catalogue these\noccupations by looking at education requirements in job postings and hourly wage data from the Labor\nDepartment. The list of opportunity occupations vary from registered nurses to truck drivers, retail sales\nsupervisors, carpenters, and patrol officers. So whether a person likes dealing with people or working\nwith their hands, and whether they are interested in a career in health care, construction,\ntransportation, or sales, one of the many opportunity occupations may fit their idea of a good job.\nTo be clear, many of these jobs require on-the-job experience or some type of training after high school,\nand some positions advertised online required a college degree. But nationally, Keith and his colleagues\ncalculated that 21.6 percent of jobs in 2017 could be classified as opportunity occupations. In the\nPhiladelphia–Camden–Wilmington metro area, the share was slightly lower, at 20.1 percent.\nThese occupations offer workers without college degrees the chance to be part of our growing economy\nand to become financially secure. Giving more people the opportunity to participate in the economy\nstrengthens our economy because more paychecks support increased consumer spending. It’s a win–\nwin situation for all of us.\nIndeed, emphasizing skills rather than degrees might help to reverse a troubling longer-run trend in the\nU.S. economy, and that is the high number of adults who are not in the labor force. The share of\nworking-age adults who are participating in the labor force — which includes those who are employed\nand those who are unemployed but actively looking for work — came in at just 63.1 percent in 2019,\ndown from 65.4 percent 10 years ago. What this says to me is that the U.S. is missing out on the\n\n6\n\n\fpotential these adults could bring to the economy. This will, no doubt, require innovative thinking and\nnew ways of investing in the workforce, but the payoffs are likely to be substantial.\nI know the popular notion is that artificial intelligence and robots will make workforce development\nunnecessary. But let me return to our study about the time needed to fill job openings and mention that\nthe occupations that are hardest to fill include registered nurses, retail store managers, and physicians.\nThese are jobs that are least at risk for automation. They require uniquely human skills and can’t easily\nbe done by robots. Employers can’t expect these jobs to disappear any time soon, and that is why it is\nimperative for employers to invest in those unique humans who can develop the communication,\nteamwork, and service skills that will get the job done.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fEconomic Outlook\nEconomic Leadership Forum\nNew Jersey Bankers Association\nSomerset, NJ\nJanuary 17, 2020\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nOne of the things I’ve noticed about this job is that people find me a lot more interesting when I’m a\nvoting member of the FOMC. So I won’t take it personally that the last time I spoke to this group was\nalmost exactly three years ago …\nSome things look very different in 2020 than they did in 2017. The makeup of the Fed’s Board of\nGovernors has changed. We are in a different part of the business cycle. My outlook for interest rates is\nmarkedly dissimilar. But some things have held firm. Specifically, while the outlook for rates may be\nstarkly different, a lot of the phrases I used to describe the state of the economy back in 2017 still\napply today.\nThat’s positive news and pretty amazing when you consider how much the world has changed since\n2017.\nToday I will touch on three issues that are integral in today’s banking world. The first is the economic\noutlook, a key driver for loan demand and investment opportunities. The second is an aspect of\nmonetary policy that has been in the news over the past few months; namely, how the Fed is\nnormalizing its balance sheet. Last, I will touch on the ongoing efforts around modernizing the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA).\nLet me begin with the standard disclaimer — which I used three years ago — about my views being my\nown and not necessarily reflective of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Economic Outlook\nOverall, the economy is looking pretty good. We are in the longest economic expansion on record, and I\nsee growth returning to trend of about 2 percent this year, a view that is widely shared.\n\n1\n\n\fJust as I said last time I was here in 2017, I will note that the labor market continues to show\nconsiderable strength. In fact, it has outperformed most people’s expectations, with continued job\ncreation, continued low unemployment, and more people continuing to come off the sidelines.\nAt some point, we’ll return to a trend of creating about 100,000 net new jobs per month. I’ve said that,\ntoo, in years past, and it hasn’t yet come to fruition, which is great for the American workforce. And\nwhen we do return to trend — whenever that may be — it’s important to note that, while 100,000 jobs\na month may look disappointing in comparison with the strong numbers we’ve seen over the past\nseveral years, it will more than keep pace with growth in the labor force.\nMore good news in the labor market includes the fact that wages on the lower end of the pay scale have\nfinally started to rise — as they have on the higher end — although midrange paychecks could still use a\nboost.\nThe continued strength of the labor market has contributed to booming consumer confidence. And with\nconsumer spending making up some 70 percent of the U.S. economy, that makes it the hero in the\ngrowth story. Business investment, however, is lagging, and the uncertainty attached to fiscal and other\npolicies, has continued to hold it back. So, too, have international developments, including the global\nslowdown, trade uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions.\nHere’s something else I said in 2017 — and in 2018 and in 2019 — while we haven’t quite met our 2\npercent inflation target, we’re on track to get there. I still believe that inflation will rise to meet our goal,\nalbeit slowly, and we’re closing in on the target. But it has been a long time coming. To most people, this\nis a purely academic problem — who else but policymakers are going to complain that inflation is\nhovering below 2 percent? But because of our dual mandate, focusing on the inflation rate is more than\nan academic exercise.\nNew Jersey’s Economy\nAs for the Garden State’s economy, some numbers show New Jersey outperforming the nation, and\nothers show some shortfall — but not by a lot. And as a lifelong South Jersey boy, I am happy to say our\nstate’s economy is in good shape. Job growth has hovered around 1 percent over the past three years, a\nlittle below the U.S. rate of about 1.5 percent. However, the unemployment rate is 3.4 percent, which is\nslightly better than the national average. That is despite the fact that New Jersey’s jobless rate has\nticked up in recent months. But even here, I view the news as positive. That’s because the rise in the\nrate reflects more people coming back into the labor force. The state’s labor force participation rate has\n2\n\n\frisen from about 62 percent last summer, to 63.6 percent at the end of 2019. That suggests more\nresidents are feeling confident about the labor market and their ability to find work.\nI should mention that the Philadelphia Fed’s own state leading index for New Jersey recently turned\nnegative. But that reflects the rise in the jobless rate. Since that rise is the result of more people coming\ninto the labor market, I am not worried about New Jersey’s economic future.\nMonetary Policy\nThe main subject of this speech is monetary policy. While it is usual to discuss interest rates, today I\nwant to touch on another key aspect of monetary policy going forward, and that is the Fed’s efforts to\nnormalize the balance sheet. This has received great attention lately, ever since the repo market\nproblems of last September.\nAs you know, at the start of 2019, the FOMC decided that we would continue to conduct monetary\npolicy in a regime of “ample reserves,” in which control over the federal funds rate is exercised primarily\nthrough the setting of administered rates, and the supply of reserves does not need to be actively\nmanaged.\nShortly after that, we announced our plan to cease asset redemptions and hold the balance sheet to\nroughly a constant size come September. As currency and other non-reserve liabilities grew, aggregate\nreserves naturally declined. Our end game was for reserves to reach a level “consistent with efficient\nand effective implementation of monetary policy.”\nThere were two primary objectives to this approach. First, to reduce uncertainty about asset purchases\nby announcing our plans well in advance. Second, to approach the necessary level of reserves, which is\nitself filled with uncertainty, with an abundance of caution.\nWe only have estimates of the demand for reserves, although we’ve conducted a great deal of research\naround the Federal Reserve System, including continued conversation with market participants. In fact,\nstaff at the Philadelphia and New York Feds were among the first to identify that the need for reserves\ncould be much larger than initially anticipated. To be on the safe side, it made sense to move slowly,\nbuying time to carefully observe market developments and better assess their implications. That is, we\ngave ourselves time for the inevitable “unknown unknowns” of life.\nJust such an unknown arose in September.\n\n3\n\n\fThe episode was clearly triggered by the outsized flows of funds to the Treasury. But the dates for tax\npayments and bond settlements are not a surprise; they are fixed on the fiscal calendar and well known\nto both policymakers and markets. Everyone was expecting large liquidity flows.\nThe impact, however, was clearly much larger than anyone anticipated, markets included.\nThe repo market took the brunt of the impact, as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rose\nabove 5 percent on Tuesday, September 17, with some trades executed at rates as high as 10 percent.\nWhile this was certainly not an average day, it’s important to note that the repo market did not freeze.\nThe volume of secured overnight finance remained steady, at the $1.2 trillion level it had maintained for\nthe past several months.\nThe funding pressures in secured markets passed through to the federal funds market. The effective\nfederal funds rate rose to the top of target range on Monday the 16th, and surpassed the top of the\nrange by 5 basis points the next day.\nWe immediately took action to ensure that the effective fed funds rate returned to, and stayed within,\nthe target range. The very next day, the Desk started repurchase operations to stem the pressures on\nmoney markets, and these actions have continued — including term operations — to date.\nIn October, the FOMC decided to restart asset purchases to keep reserves at or above the level reached\nin early September, at a little over $1.5 trillion. Additionally, the Desk has been conducting term and\novernight repurchase agreement operations to offset money market pressures — for instance, the\nquarter-end dynamics that are inevitably more burdensome at the year’s end. All in all, since\nSeptember, we have supplied about $400 billion in additional reserves; about $250 billion via repo\nagreements, and the rest in asset purchases.\nThese measures clearly worked, with the effective fed funds rate maintaining a virtually constant level\nsince October, and repo markets staying calm. Instead of wreaking havoc, the year’s end was a nonevent.\nGoing forward, the Committee remains committed to implementing monetary policy in a regime of\nample reserves, which, again, does not require active management of the supply of reserves. The\nTreasury purchases announced in October will continue until at least the next quarter to ensure we\nmeet that goal.\n\n4\n\n\fCentral to this event is the question of why liquidity did not flow smoothly to where it was needed most.\nAre some of the market’s pipes rusty? Clogged? Are more needed? Has regulation inadvertently\ncontributed to some erosion or blockage?\nAnother question is whether the Fed ought to expand our toolkit — whether we could, or should, do\nmore to ensure interest-rate control. One possibility under discussion is a standing repo facility. We are\nin the process of evaluating such a facility’s potential costs and benefits, and exploring possible designs\nas well as alternatives, so it is still very much in the discourse, rather than the decision, phase.\nWhile September’s turmoil offered perhaps too much excitement, it also provided a good deal of\ninformation. It showed that we need a larger pool of reserves than most of our estimates had initially\nindicated. It showed that when reserves are scarce, even for as short a period as a week or so, it can\ngenerate large spikes in money market rates. And it showed, unfortunately, that banks remain\nextremely reluctant to borrow from the discount window, even when that reluctance results in outsized\npenalties far above the primary credit rate.\nCRA Modernization\nFinally, I know the banking community is awaiting final resolution to the discussion about modernizing\nthe Community Reinvestment Act. Our meeting here today is taking place north of the jagged line that\ndivides New Jersey between the New York Fed and the Philadelphia Fed. For those of you in the\naudience from South Jersey, you know that the discussion about the CRA takes on significant\nimportance in the Fed’s Third District, and we have hosted one-on-one meetings, roundtable\ndiscussions, and conferences with both banks and community members to better understand their\nconcerns and gather their insights on updates to the regulation.\nThe CRA was passed in 1977, and the last significant update to the legislation was done back in 1995. As\nregulators, we have heard feedback over the years for the need to update and revise the CRA, and in\n2018, we began an interagency process to make significant changes that reflect modern banking and\ncommunity needs.\nThe Philadelphia Fed hosted a conference on CRA modernization in February 2019, and that event\nallowed us to listen as various community development experts and financial industry leaders weighed\nin on the best approach. We recognize there is value in modernizing the regulation to address the\nchanging channels that serve customers beyond bank branches, to strengthen the law’s focus on local\ncommunities, and to help bring greater consistency and predictability to CRA ratings.\n5\n\n\fAs you probably know, the FDIC and OCC released their proposals in the fall of 2019. Last week,\nGovernor Lael Brainard unveiled the Fed’s own approach. The Fed’s proposal is based not only on the\nfeedback we heard from bankers and communities but also insights from the advanced notice of\nproposed rulemaking public comment process and a thorough review of a number of performance\nevaluations. In my view, modernizing the CRA will help banks better meet the credit needs in the lowand moderate-income communities they serve.\nBecause these updates to the CRA will impact your business models, I assume that you have read the\nideas and the metrics of the Fed’s plan, so I won’t go into much detail. But let me make some points\nabout the Fed’s proposal.\nThe Fed is proposing the creation of two tests: a retail test to assess a bank’s record of retail loans and\nservices in its assessment area; and a community development test for large banks, and wholesale and\nlimited-purpose banks to measure a bank’s performance on community development loans, qualified\ninvestments, and other services. A separate retail test will align with the key focus of the CRA, which is\nto ensure that banks are meeting the credit needs of underserved markets. Separate tests also\nunderscore the importance of the ability to tailor exams to each institution’s asset size, business lines,\nand local conditions.\nOur proposal also hones in on the importance of metrics and data dashboards, and distilling that data\ninto helping banks better track and benchmark their CRA performance. We at the Fed like to say we are\n“data driven,” and these dashboards will show that data matter not just in monetary policy but in the\nwork the Fed does in ensuring the U.S. has a robust and equitable financial system.\nTo reiterate what Governor Brainard said last Wednesday, “it is more important to get reforms right\nthan to do them quickly.” I couldn’t agree more with that sentiment when it comes to an important\npiece of legislation like the CRA. To achieve that goal, regulators at the Fed are having discussions with\nthe other banking regulators. We are mindful of the business costs that two sets of rules would impose\non banks. And I am hopeful that we can create a consensus going forward.\nConclusion\nCongress gave the Federal Reserve a dual mandate to maximize employment and stabilize prices. The\ndata show that the labor market is doing incredibly well, and I believe the economy is nearing our target\ninflation rate of 2 percent. All in all, my outlook for the economy is positive, but let me add that my\noutlook will continue to be driven by the data as each report is released throughout 2020.\n6\n\n\fThe data will also determine my view on monetary policy. And policy entails more than interest rates. As\nthe Fed oversees its balance sheet, we will be mindful of the unexpected, such as happened last\nSeptember.\nAnd with that, let me open the floor up to questions.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nI’m a generally inquisitive person by nature, and one of the perks of being a Fed president is that\nindulging my curiosity is actually a job requirement — discussions like this give us good feedback and\ninsight, and it’s important to maintain an open, transparent dialogue. So I’m very happy to be here.\nThough I should note the flipside: One of the perils of being a Fed president is that you open yourself to\nthe risk that discussion turns into inquisition …\nToday’s roundtable is titled “Monetary Policy Normalization: Low Interest Rates and the New Normal,”\nand it’s probably telling that those 10 relatively short words contain multitudes.\nSo I’d like to start with a brief recap of the key issues and recent events that influence today’s\nconversation — or at least, as brief as I can make them — then head straight into the discussion.\nFirst, however, as is par for the course, I’ll issue the standard disclaimer that the views I express today\nare my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nI always issue that disclaimer, but I’m highly aware that people care a lot more about what I have to say\nin years that I’m a voting member of the FOMC. So my New Year’s resolution is to say it whenever I\nspeak, even if I’m just ordering a sandwich …\nOur initial intent for today was to focus on the unwinding of the balance sheet, and as you can see, I’m\naccompanied by my colleague Roc Armenter, who is one of the principal architects of our approach. But\npolicy does not exist in a vacuum, and, of course, there are other, connected topics, including the\ndisruption in the money markets last September.\nTo set the stage then, I’ll remind everyone of where we were, where we are, and where we’re going.\n\n1\n\n\fIn the Beginning — Balance Sheet Normalization\nAs you know, at the start of 2019, the FOMC decided that we would continue to conduct monetary\npolicy in a regime of “ample reserves,” in which control over the federal funds rate is exercised primarily\nthrough the setting of administered rates, and the supply of reserves does not need to be actively\nmanaged.\nShortly after that, we announced our plan to cease asset redemptions and hold the balance sheet to\nroughly a constant size come September.

First, to reduce uncertainty about asset purchases\nby announcing our plans well in advance.

Instead of wreaking havoc, the year’s end was a nonevent. The money markets essentially rang in the New Year by binge watching Netflix in their PJs instead\nof with noisemakers and popped corks.\nImplementation Framework Going Forward\nGoing forward, the Committee remains committed to implementing monetary policy in a regime of\nample reserves, which, again, does not require active management of the supply of reserves. The\nTreasury purchases announced in October will continue until at least the next quarter to ensure we\nmeet that goal.\nCentral to this event is the question of why the liquidity did not flow smoothly to where it was needed\nmost. Are some of the market’s pipes rusty? Clogged? Are more needed? Has regulation inadvertently\ncontributed to some erosion or blockage?\nThe second question is whether the Fed ought to expand our toolkit — whether we could, or should, do\nmore to ensure interest-rate control. One possibility under discussion is a standing repo facility. We are\nin the process of evaluating the potential costs and benefits, and exploring possible designs as well as\nalternatives, so it is still very much in the discourse, rather than the decision, phase.\n3\n\n\fWhile September’s turmoil offered perhaps too much excitement, it also provided a good deal of\ninformation. It showed that we need a larger pool of reserves than most of our estimates had initially\nindicated. It showed that when reserves are scarce, even for as short a period as a week or so, it can\ngenerate large spikes in money market rates. And it showed, unfortunately, that banks remain\nextremely reluctant to borrow from the discount window, even when that reluctance results in outsized\npenalties far above the primary credit rate.\nMonetary Policy Review\nThis episode highlights that some fundamental shifts have occurred in market functioning. And, in fact,\nas the world’s economies rebuilt over the course of the lengthy recovery, we’ve come out the other side\nto a state of normalcy that doesn’t look exactly like it did before the financial crisis.\nLast year, we began a broad review of the strategies, tools, and communication practices we use in\npursuit of our monetary policy goals. Again, that’s an important undertaking on both a philosophical\nlevel and as a general exercise in good practice. But it’s also important because we find ourselves in new\nterritory, as the U.S. economy has changed in ways that impact the efficacy of our policymaking. In\nparticular, the natural rate of interest, both at home and abroad, appears to have fallen, increasing the\npossibility of moving ever closer to the zero lower bound, which, in turn, dilutes the power of our\nmonetary policy tools in combatting downturns.\nIt’s been said often, but bears repeating, that a change to our 2 percent inflation goal is not on the table.\nBut it is nonetheless a wide-ranging review. As you may have seen in the minutes from the FOMC’s\nSeptember meeting, makeup strategies were discussed, and we reviewed the utility of unconventional\npolicy tools — such as balance-sheet policies and forward guidance — in October. We expect to reach\nsome preliminary findings by midyear, but we also expect these conversations to be ongoing.\nI’ve personally found this exercise to be fascinating from an academic standpoint and vital from the\npolicymaker’s roost. But the highlight for me has really been the series of Fed Listens events\nspearheaded by Vice Chair Clarida. Each of the 12 District Banks hosted outreach and consultation\nevents with a broad range of people and groups, including labor leaders, nonprofits, community leaders,\nand local business owners. Even though the economy is in good shape, it works differently for different\npeople and places, and it’s important to put context and contour to the discussion.\nI’m going to end with that observation, because we’re here for a discussion, not a monologue, and I’m\nmore than ready to dive into the context and contour you bring to the discussion.\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fAn Economic Outlook\nCommercial-Industrial Realty Council’s 25th Annual Joint Holiday Dinner\nWilmington, DE\nNovember 13, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be back in Blue Hens territory, and I am truly happy to be here this evening.\nI’ve worn a few professional hats in my day, each of which required a certain degree of measured\nspeech and withholding personal opinion. There are things you can and can’t say in almost every job,\nand that’s never been more true, for me, than as a Fed president. We have to be measured and\ncircumspect about how and when we speak. We steer away from controversial political and social\nissues. But I do feel, in this room tonight, that I would be remiss if I didn’t draw attention to a flagrant\nblow to the heart of Delaware culture and tradition. How on earth is punkin chunkin moving to Illinois!?\nSince I have, now, delved into a deeply important social issue, it’s a good time to give my colleagues\nconcrete deniability and share the requisite Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect anyone else’s in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that taken care of: I’ve spent a lot of years talking in front of crowds, mostly in the realm of\nacademia. So my audiences have largely been required to show up and listen to the hour I had to fill. On\nthis occasion, however, I’m going to keep my remarks short, because I get much more out of your\nquestions and hearing what you have to say than I do from lecturing, and I’m positive it’s also more\ninteresting for you than listening to a policymaker drone on. Not to mention that I’ve found that those\nconversations are significantly more lively after everyone’s had a good dinner and a glass or two of wine\n… so with that, I’ll give a brief outlook on the economy and where I see policy headed, then turn it over\nto you for questions.\n\n1\n\n\fThe headline on my views these days is: not much news. Despite spirited conversations on all aspects of\nthe economy, my outlook has stayed relatively steady.\nStarting with employment, I feel comfortable saying that we’ve met our remit. The labor market\ncontinues to evince remarkable strength. Unemployment is at a 50-year low, and the pace of job\ncreation continues at above the rate we’ll need to keep pace with growth. That continued resilience is\nimportant, particularly in the Philadelphia Fed’s District — where many of our cities and towns trail\nnational averages — because as the market gets tighter and tighter, it starts to finally reach the people\nwho are most likely to miss out on the good fortune of positive economic trends. There are still people\non the sidelines, and we have continued to see more of them reenter the workforce. More people on\nthe margins are finding their way back into employment and a future. And from the business\nperspective, the biggest issue on the labor front has been a lack of skills and a lack of workers. So the\nmore people, the better, all around.\nI do want to note that this trend obviously can’t go on forever and, at some point, the pace of job\ncreation will slow. When that happens, there’s likely to be a decent amount of doom and gloom in the\nheadlines and laced through the commentary. But it’s important to remember that about 100,000 jobs a\nmonth or so is trend; it’s what we’ll need to keep pace with growth, and we’ve been seeing rates much\nhigher than that for several years. That said, I do still see unemployment staying below the 4 percent\nmark for the next couple of years, assuming that conditions play out more or less as expected.\nTurning to the inflation side of our mandate, this is, of course, the one that’s proven more difficult.\nInflation has not only shied away from our 2 percent goal for some time, it’s defied our predictions of\nwhen it will finally get there time and time again. With that in mind, I want to note that inflation is not\nrunning backwards; rather, it’s edging up — to be fair, it is sometimes taking a step back after two steps\nforward. But it is on track, and it is heading, on average, in the right direction. Ultimately, I do see it\nreaching our goal in the next 18 to 24 months.\nGrowth has also captured some negative headlines, but again, I think they mischaracterize the data: On\nthe aggregate, it has continued to meet our expectations. I remain of the opinion that we’ll see GDP\ngrowth of a little above 2 percent for 2019, returning to trend of about 2 percent next year.\nWhether or not 2 percent is an adequate pace of growth has been another subject of debate, but there\nis, by and large, consensus among economists and forecasters that this is trend. And from a policy\nperspective, there isn’t much that monetary policy can do to change that. I’ve said before — ad\n2\n\n\fnauseam, really — that the power and reach of monetary policy is relatively constricted. Meaningful\nchange to the nation’s growth trajectory requires fiscal policy. The Fed can create the conditions for\ngrowth to take root, but for it to flourish, it needs the nourishment of legislative action.\nWe are riding the wave of the longest economic recovery on record, and that’s a positive. The economy\nis in a good place.\nThat said, there are, of course, headwinds, the strongest being uncertainty. Trade and international\ndevelopments, including slowing overall global growth, have cast a shadow of ambiguity. And as anyone\nwho’s sat on a corporate board can tell you, in those situations, when the future is murky, you wait to\nmake decisions. And while the consumer has been the hero of this year’s growth story, that can’t be the\nsingle engine. We need business investment to drive the economy as well.\nNormally, that’s where I’d stop with an outlook speech, but I have the premier collection of Delaware’s\nreal estate community in front of me, so I don’t think I can get away without mentioning the housing\nmarket.\nOn the residential side, home price growth has slowed down noticeably in the past several years.\nHowever, the figures have been improving in recent months. And while current readings of inventory, as\nwell as construction, of single-family housing remain low relative to their historical norms, they are\nimproving. Low mortgage rates in the recent months have also had some impact. On the consumer side,\ndelinquency rates continue to fall, signaling a healthier credit market. For the Fed’s Third District, the\noverall story is similar to the national one. However, as with many indices in our area, the recovery has\ntaken a bit longer to reach our local markets.\nWith the outlook generally positive, and the economy in a good place, I come to the part that everyone\nreally cares about: rates. My own view is that we should hold steady for a while and watch how things\nunfold before taking any more action. I am not a voting member on the FOMC this year, but I held this\nsame view regarding the last two cuts. I would have preferred to hold firm. And while it wasn’t my\npreference, it does act as a good reminder that monetary policy in the United States is a deliberative\nprocess. Every region of the country is represented around the table, and policy made by a plurality of\nviews and opinions will necessarily be thoughtful and temperate.\nWith all that said and done, it’s time to move the floor over to you. One of the most important sources\nof information for a Fed president is the people who see major industries and sectors from the ground.\n\n3\n\n\fYour insight is invaluable, and I’m most looking forward to what you have to say. Especially about the\ncatastrophic loss of punkin chunkin.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fWorking on Working: Reimagining Training Models in a New Era\nBusiness Innovations for the Future of Work\nDrexel University\nPhiladelphia, PA\nNovember 6, 2019\nPresented by Patrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood afternoon. It really is important to have this group assembled here to have these\nconversations, so I first want to thank everyone for coming.\nSecond, I want to deliver a disclaimer that’s familiar by now to our friends and partners: The\nviews I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThe agenda topics are so important because we’re addressing the future of work at a distinctive\npoint of history. No one here needs to be told that the landscape of work is changing. But I\nwould argue that that’s always been the case: From the Industrial Revolution to the rise of\nSilicon Valley, we have always found new and more efficient ways of doing things. It’s a\nfundamental part of the human story.\nThings are, however, a bit different this time around. For one, the change is coming a lot faster\nthan it used to. For another, the labor market itself is different. Together, they create a unique\nset of circumstances that pretty much gives us the chance of a lifetime.\nUnemployment is at a half-century low. Businesses are having trouble finding skilled workers.\nThis has, to some extent, forced us to view the workforce from a new perspective. In an\nemployers’ market, it’s easy to see jobs as individual vacancies; there’s a seemingly endless\nsupply of candidates, each one more credentialed than the last. But when the candidates are in\nshorter supply than the jobs, we have to think about how to solve the problem systemically —\n1\n\n\fnot just to fill the vacancies we have now, but to train, recruit, and upskill a workforce that can\nadapt to future needs. Because we know that future is coming at us fast.\nAn abundance of research, including from the Philadelphia Fed, has shown the effect\nautomation will have — and is already having — on work. There is no question that technology\nis altering or eliminating some jobs, just as it has throughout history. Research shows, however,\nthat other hallmarks of those previous cycles are also evident now: Where some jobs are\ndestroyed, others will emerge. The Luddites may have been right about how the mechanized\nloom would affect them individually, but it created a boom in the textile industry that required\na host of new workers. Today, too, we see new jobs arising from the exact machines that\nrendered the old ones obsolete: Even five years ago, who’d heard of a professional drone\noperator? Now employers can’t find enough of them.\nWhat’s crucial in the research on artificial intelligence is that we don’t just know what jobs are\nlikely to go, we know who’s likely to be most affected. It’s the people who are already\ndisproportionately represented among vulnerable workers — women, people of color, younger\npeople, and workers in lower-skilled positions. But this presents an opportunity. We can\npinpoint the people who’ll need support; the people businesses can view as the next wave of\nskilled workers. That allows businesses to create a pool of desperately needed talent, but more\nimportantly, it means we can create access to careers, instead of the soul-crushing cycle of\ntaking a job, losing it to a machine, finding a new one, and being automated out of that. This is\nan incredible opportunity, as long as we make that investment, and make it in the right way.\nWe have an abundance of research that points to the skills we’ll need in, and for, the future.\nPeople will need technological skills, of course — everything from your sandwich order at\nWawa to health care is being digitized. But one of the most important lessons of AI’s march\nforward is that it makes the advantage of distinctly human skills entirely clear. More than\nanything right now, employers are looking for those abilities, the “soft skills” that can’t be\nrobotized. Which means that as we look at the methods and programs we put into place to\ntrain people — whether they’re our existing staff, people who’ll be displaced by automation, or\npeople still on the sidelines — we know that technical skills are key, but they should be taught\n2\n\n\fwith an emphasis on adaptability and critical thinking. We need programs that arm people with\npractical knowledge, while honing those core, uniquely human skills that will allow them to not\njust perform well in one specific job, but to succeed as that job — and the next one — evolves.\nAnd, importantly, to move up the professional ladder.\nOne of the most important factors in this event’s discussions is that it convenes a multitude of\nplayers. Because none of this can be accomplished by a single group or sector.\nIt would be easy to frame this discussion in terms of outcomes — who benefits and why that\nshould motivate them. But the truth is, there’s no one discrete incentive for any particular\nsector; there are a thousand good reasons, all intertwined, that matter to all of us. A skilled,\nadaptable workforce is good for everyone. It gets business done, it draws investment to cities,\nand it lifts the local economy. It helps us build more inclusive growth and a more equitable\nsociety.\nAnd it stands to reason that if we all benefit, we should all play a part.\nEach of us, whether we come from a public, private, philanthropic, or academic organization,\nhas expertise that the rest of us need.\nIt’s a core tenet of management science that the most effective leaders assemble a team of\nexperts.\nIn our work at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve gathered examples of this in our Research in Action\nLabs. Our academic research provides a host of evidence that we’re working to apply practically\nin communities around our District. But it obviously wouldn’t work if we just marched in and\ntold people what the academic paper says we should do. We have to have partners from all\ncorners — they’re the ones with the expertise. So when, for instance, we launched the first RIA\nLab in northeastern PA to improve transportation infrastructure, we had representatives from\nthe community, business, labor, city officials. Everyone played a role.\nWhat’s important about this is that we collectively found a way to address both the region’s\nand individual participants’ specific issues. For instance, Geisinger, the main health-care\nprovider in the region, is feeling the industry-wide pressure of rapidly increasing need coupled\n3\n\n\fwith a workforce in short supply. And like any other job, if your employees can’t get to you, you\ndon’t have a staff. But a light bulb went off during the process that they could solve a second\nproblem: They were losing money when people didn’t show up to their appointments. So they\nstarted an “appointment navigator” initiative to cover those last miles, whether by van, taxi, or\nride share, to ensure their patients could get there.\nThat’s the kind of creative thinking we need right now. And while each city and town is unique,\nwe now have a blueprint we can hand to other areas.\nSo this conversation between and across experts is vitally important, and that outside-the-box\nthinking is equally crucial. We hear from employers, for instance, that there’s a massive skills\nshortage. And there’s evidence to back that up. But we also hear from hiring experts — and our\nown research shows — that some of that might be mitigated by different attitudes and\napproaches to recruiting.\nOur economists analyzed a huge data set — more than 90 percent of all online postings — to\nlook at the factors affecting the length of time a job stays open. One of those researchers, Ryo\nTashiro, will discuss this study with you, so I’ll keep the spoilers to a minimum. But overall, they\nfound what we would expect, which is that routine, manual positions filled quickly and the ones\nrequiring cognitive skills stayed open longer. Or, the ones most likely to automate were most\neasily filled, while the ones requiring innately human skills were hardest. They also found that\nthe higher the bar for educational attainment or years’ experience, the more time the position\nwent unfilled.\nThe clear lesson is that it’s harder to hire a psychologist than an assembly-line worker. But\nthere may be something more, something we saw in a different area of research. “Opportunity\noccupations” are ones that pay at or above the median wage but don’t require a four-year\ndegree. And while, by definition, they don’t require a traditional degree, there was evidence\nthat employers began inflating degree and experience expectations in the years after the\nrecession. We saw this trend in other areas as well, and while it has largely reversed itself, it’s a\ngood reminder to think about what we’re really looking for. As someone who comes from\nacademia, it surprises people when I say we often assign too much power to that traditional\n4\n\n\fdegree. This moment requires thinking creatively, and that includes reassessing our\nassessment. Looking beyond degrees as the sole benchmark of skill can help mine those\nuntapped resources.\nAnd, finally, that shift in thinking has to extend to how we see workers — not as an expense,\nbut an investment; a core asset that’s essential to the business. That could be upskilling existing\nstaff or investing in local potential. All those people at risk of being automated out of a job\ncould go through the revolving doors of the traditional “train and pray” model, or we can\ninvest in them to give them, and Philadelphia, a better future.\nObviously, we can’t ask people to make an investment we’re not willing to make ourselves. In\n2018, the Philadelphia Fed brought on Social Finance to help us launch an innovative new\nfunding model for workforce investment — one that allows private sector firms to be investors,\nrather than simply serving on boards or allocating philanthropic dollars.\nOutside of this room, that might not sound radical. But in the world of public-private\npartnerships, it’s essentially turning the old model on its head. And we’re very pleased that two\nof those partners are with us today.\nThe first is Philadelphia Works, our local workforce investment board, which will be providing\nthe upfront investment in this pilot training program. The other is a company that is on the\nfrontline of technological and workforce change, and knows firsthand the skills that are vital to\nPhiladelphia: Comcast.\nAs part of this new financial model, Comcast is committed to paying for outcomes once they\nare achieved, such as staying on the job for over six months. The model also creates a better\nfeedback loop between employers and the workforce board to make it more effective.\nAt the heart of this partnership are the subjects we’re tackling here today: training that\ndevelops both technical and adaptive skills; a collaborative approach that brings in experts\nacross sectors; and a fundamental understanding that workforce development is an\ninvestment.\n5\n\n\fAnd now, I’m very pleased to introduce one of the people who made this pilot happen, the cofounder and CEO of Social Finance, Tracy Palandjian.\nUnder Tracy’s direction, Social Finance is leading the field of Pay for Success financing and\nSocial Impact Bonds. She brings an unparalleled perspective to this conversation, so please help\nme welcome her to share some of those insights.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\f2019 Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, MO\nOctober 2, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning and thank you. It’s great to be here, and to share space on an agenda with so\nmany experts and voices of authority on community banking issues, including some of my\nFederal Reserve colleagues. The one problem is that when you speak on day two of a\nconference like this, you run the risk that your colleagues already made the most important\npoints, and you’ll just sound repetitive.\nAnd while we hopefully won’t sound exactly the same, I’m sure we’re all touching on at least\nsome of the same themes. Because if there’s one thing that I’ve found unanimous agreement\non, it’s the importance of community banks.\nSince I’m mentioning the views of my Fed colleagues, now is probably a good time to interject\nthe standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. Which is something else\nyou’ve probably already heard …\nAs I said, if there is one overarching message to both this conference and our work within the\nFederal Reserve, it is the critical importance of community banks. The Philadelphia Fed is largely\na community bank supervisor, so we have a front-row seat to the effects of community banking\nthroughout our District, and the way it’s embedded in the DNA of our local economies.\nWe were particularly proud to note that the winning team in the CSBS’s case study contest was\nwon by a Pennsylvania school —congratulations again to Juniata College — and, in fact, almost\none-third of the teams hailed from Pennsylvania.\n1\n\n\fThe Philadelphia Fed has the smallest geographic District in the System, which I actually see as a\nstrategic advantage. Within those borders, we have areas that reflect the makeup of the\ncountry as a whole: urban, rural, suburban, postindustrial. So we get insight on a diverse set of\neconomic profiles. Our size also makes it easier to spend time out in the District, talking to\nbusiness and community leaders to get a better take on what they’re seeing day to day.\nSomething I’ve seen again and again is that the places that are doing well are the places where\nthere’s a strong community banking presence. In fact, I’d say that, particularly for smaller cities\nand towns, community banks are essential to their economic success.\nBut community banks don’t just have local or regional impact; the insight we get from our\ncontacts gives context to a remarkably complex national economy. And that factors into my\nown views on monetary policy when we’re considering what steps to take for the country as a\nwhole.\nI often note that the U.S. economy — the biggest, and arguably most complex, in the world — is\nfundamentally just a collection of myriad microeconomies. It’s communities and localities,\nneighborhoods and families, and businesses of all sizes. As both businesses and as the\ntouchstones of those individual economies, community banks play a key role in their success.\nFor that reason, it’s important that regulators recognize — and help mitigate — the challenges\nyou face. Because there are several issues on the horizon, including technological change,\ndemographic pressures, and regulatory burden.\nAgain, I know I’m repeating the messages you’ve already heard from my colleagues and\ncontemporaries. But given the importance of community banks to the economy and the\nfinancial system, they’re worth repeating.\nTechnological Change\nI’m being followed on the agenda by a panel on technology’s impact on banking, and that’s\nbeen a central discussion across industries for some time. Cybersecurity, of course, has been a\nconcern for banks of all sizes, but the pressure on smaller institutions can intensify when they\ncan’t attain the same economies of scale as the larger ones.\n2\n\n\fThen there are advances in fintech and changes to businesses of all sorts with the continued\nmarch of overall technological disruption.\nWe at the Philadelphia Fed have a particular focus on technological advancement — how\nmachine learning and AI affect the workforce and business decisions; how it’s impacting choices\npeople make about education and training; and how, frankly, it is changing the entire economic\nlandscape. And community banks are certainly not immune.\nBut I think there are two important things to remember for this sector in particular.\nFirst, that change isn’t new; it’s been a constant feature of the industry for decades. It just looks\ndifferent now. Second, I think those advancements in general amplify the unique importance of\ncommunity banks, and, in fact, create opportunities.\nTaking those in turn, technological change itself is not new — many of you have been in the\nindustry for a long time and have seen that firsthand. Fintech absolutely presents a\nfundamental change in the way we bank — but so did securitization, credit scoring, and prepaid\ncards. So did ATMs. It’s true that they all look pretty quaint when you compare them to today’s\ntechnology — just like a Walkman looks virtually antique compared to a streaming app on your\nphone. But both the Walkman and the ATM were revolutionary at the time.\nBanking has seen constant change and churn for the past half century. The difference is that\ntoday’s technology makes the delivery system more advanced than ever before, and it\nturbocharges the pace of change. Peer-to-peer lending, for instance, has been going on since\nhumanity first established a barter system; it’s just being delivered via a different platform. In\nmy day, it took the form of Frankie borrowing $20 from Jimmy at the local bar. I suppose one\nbig difference is that Jimmy knew where Frankie lived, so default rates were significantly lower\nin the low-tech version.\nOverall, however, with fintech, it’s the platform that’s new, rather than the product or service.\nThat, of course, presents a business opportunity. It’s likely that partnerships between\ncommunity banks and fintechs are going to increase, because the fundamentals of the banking\nsystem aren’t going to change. Whatever mode or method technology provides to deliver those\n3\n\n\fservices, they still need a trusted broker of money. And while bigger institutions may be better\npositioned to take on the risk of a fintech partnership, the fundamental advantage of\ncommunity banks is the high level of trust their customers have in them. While community\nbanks will obviously have to do their due diligence in forming partnerships, I’d argue that their\ndeep base of trust is a valuable, competitive asset from the fintech perspective.\nThe second technology-based issue is the advances in AI and machine learning, which actually\nmakes the case that the skills and expertise particular to community banking are more\nimportant now than ever before. Technology is only as smart as the data we input, and,\nparticularly in the case of functions like algorithmic lending, the advantage of community\nbanking is even more clear cut.\nCommunity banks know their customers. There’s a local understanding that can’t be\nprogrammed into a one-size-fits-all approach to lending. You heard yesterday from the Bank of\nBird-in-Hand’s CEO Lori Maley. They’re actually an example I often use, because it’s a perfect\ncase study in local understanding. On paper, the communities they serve wouldn’t look\ncreditworthy to most banks. But Bird-in-Hand knows that when something happens, the\ncommunity comes together to fix it. When a barn burns down, the community comes together\nto build a new one. If someone’s in danger of missing a scheduled payment, the community\npools their resources to make it. That knowledge and understanding of who your customers are\nis an advantage that just can’t be replicated by an algorithm.\nMy daughter and son-in-law encountered the same thing when they tried to buy insurance for\ntheir first house. Philadelphia, like most places, has some linguistic quirks, like the extra “r” in\nthe word water — or “werder.” We also have row houses, while most of the East Coast has\ntownhouses or brownstones. In conversation, it’s not a big deal. In real estate dealings, it’s a\nvery different story. My daughter’s first broker didn’t have row houses listed in the database,\nand they couldn’t just reclassify the property because the roof didn’t fit the narrow description\nof the alternatives. After a lot of time spent in a “Who’s on First”-type back and forth, they\nwalked down the street to a local agent who got the insurance approved that day.\n\n4\n\n\fThat’s just one example of how a molehill can turn into a mountain for customers. And the\nflexibility community banks have to meet local needs creates a loyal base.\nSo it’s not just that technology highlights the competitive advantage of community banks’ local\nknowledge; I honestly think it creates an opportunity as that specialist insight becomes more\nand more clear in comparison.\nDemographic and Other Changes in Community Banking\nSo community banks have expert local knowledge, they know their customers, and they reflect\nthe needs of the communities they serve. But the demographics of communities across the\ncountry are changing, as is the community banking landscape. Since 2009, the number of\ncommunity banks has declined by about one-third. Nationwide, bank failures have accounted\nfor about a fifth of the reduction, while the rest are due to M&As. In the Philadelphia Fed’s\nDistrict, the reduction in community banks has been slightly higher than the national average\nover that period — 38 percent for the Third District versus 34 percent nationwide. But the size\nof banks in the Philadelphia Fed’s District has increased significantly more than the national\naverage, with Third District banks’ median assets increasing by 89 percent, versus the national\nrate of 57 percent. Those data point to rates of M&A activity that appear to have strengthened\nthe resulting institutions and community banking overall. Over the same decade, we’ve seen a\nconcurrent change in the asset mix with a significant rise in multifamily loans — 91 percent\noverall — though they still represent just 4 percent of total assets. And while securities have\ndeclined slightly, they remain the largest portion of the asset mix at 17 percent.\nSo while there are fewer community banks in the District, they’ve grown larger and more\ncomplex.\nDemographic changes, such as aging and increasingly less-mobile populations, have already\naffected community banking as a whole, and that will likely continue, meaning they may have\nto rethink their business models. That might mean more personal lending and greater small\nbusiness lending. It could mean more commercial real estate lending or more projects with\ngreater potential risk, but also greater possibilities for reward. From the regulatory and\n5\n\n\fsupervisory perspective, it will be important to watch for those changes and work to take them\ninto account.\nRegulatory Burden\nWe do a lot of work on economic mobility in our District, and community banks have been\ncentral to our impact. Given how much is tied up in their success, I think it’s incumbent on us as\nregulators to be supportive of community banks’ continued viability.\nWe are well aware of the regulatory burdens that community banks have faced. I think that\nhumanity has a propensity to overcorrect in response to crisis, so the pendulum sometimes\nswings a bit too far in the other direction. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, it made sense\nto put every mechanism in place to prevent a reoccurrence of the worst economic disaster\nsince the Great Depression. But there’s virtually universal agreement that community banks\nwound up on the wrong end of that pendulum swing. We’ve made progress in correcting that,\nincluding easing up on timelines and reporting requirements, but there’s still more to do.\nFor me, a crucial element is how we work with banks. It’s important that we’re able to fix errors\nby working together, rather than at odds; to distinguish mistakes from bad faith. It’s also critical\nthat we continue to provide research and support. At the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve been looking\nat succession planning in particular, and our LINC program helps build relationships between\ncommunity banks and community development organizations.\nBecause community banks play such a vital role in the vibrancy of local communities, it’s\nimportant that their business strategies take that impact into account, particularly for groups\non the margins. And from the regulatory side, it’s important to make space for efforts that\nmight involve more risk, but also have the potential for greater reward.\nWe have a bank in our District, ESSA Bank & Trust, that partnered with an existing program to\nease ex-offenders’ transition back into the community. They’ve set aside $250,000 to make\nloans of up to $15,000 per person for housing, transportation, or education and training. The\nparticipants have to take financial literacy courses and provide a plan for the loan: One needed\n\n6\n\n\fa car to get to work, one trained to become a commercial truck driver, one started a small\nbusiness.\nSo far, things are going well. But I would argue that even if they did lose money, there’s more to\nconsider. ESSA is investing in their community, in an important way that’s often overlooked and\ngenerally underfunded. It has the potential for a significant return on investment for the\ncommunity, and that creates a new customer base for the bank. I think there’s room for\nflexibility and a little more risk appetite to encourage innovation.\nConclusion\nTo sum up: Community banks are important. They play vital roles in communities across the\ncountry, and they make the difference between a local economy that merely survives and one\nthat thrives. They offer insight to policymakers and a chance at success to their customers.\nThere are challenges, as there are in any industry. We’ve moved the needle on some, while\nothers still have a ways to go. It’s important that we work together as we address them,\nbecause the outcomes will have effects that resonate beyond a single sector. Because\nultimately, community banking matters to all of us.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fAn Economic Outlook\nShadow Open Market Committee Fall 2019 Meeting\nPrinceton Club\nNew York, NY\nSeptember 27, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be here today.\nOne of the great joys of this job is being surrounded by some of the world’s best economists\nand policy experts, whose ideas and insights are central to the Fed’s work and mission. On\noccasions such as today, we sometimes take the opportunity to share new research by Fed staff\nor an idea that we’ve been debating.\nSometimes life makes those choices for us.\nGiven the turmoil in the money markets last week, this seems to be one of those times.\nSo with that in mind, I’ll start with a quick outlook for the economy, then delve into what\nhappened last week, and what it means. Spoiler alert: It does not affect the stance of monetary\npolicy or have a meaningful impact on the economy.\nI thought I’d get that out there nice and early.\nAs I venture into this discussion, I’ll start with the requisite Fed disclaimer that you’ve all heard\nbefore — and that some of you have delivered yourselves — that the views I express are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Outlook\nWith that caveat firmly in place, the headline is that my outlook hasn’t really changed.\n1\n\n\fThe labor market continues to show remarkable strength, and we’re creating jobs above the\nrate we need to keep pace with growth. I expect unemployment to stay below the 4 percent\nmark for the next couple of years, assuming economic conditions unfold as forecast.\nInflation has been persistently below target for some time, but it does appear to be on track to\nmeet our preferred 2 percent goal — albeit slowly — and I think we’ll get there in the next 18\nto 24 months.\nWhile concerns about growth have been amplified lately, the trajectory looks to be about on\ntrack with our recent forecasts. Consumers continue to be the engine powering growth, fueled\nby the strong labor market. I continue to see overall GDP growth for 2019 a little above 2\npercent, returning to trend of about 2 percent next year.\nThat said, there are clear downside risks, mostly posed by trade and international\ndevelopments and the uncertainty they breed. It is that uncertainty, more than anything, that is\naffecting business decisions. We hear it again and again from our contacts, it surfaces over and\nover in the Beige Book, and it’s showing up in data on confidence and investment across\nmultiple sources.\nThat leads me to a point I’ve made before. Fed watchers often note that many of us have\nthemes or phrases we return to often. Two of my most frequent are: It’s important to\nremember that growth is fundamentally the simple sum of growth in the labor force plus\ngrowth in productivity. And monetary policy is a relatively blunt tool with relatively limited\nscope. The Federal Reserve can pull the levers available to us to create a more hospitable\nenvironment for growth, but trend economic growth is driven by fiscal policy. Monetary policy\ncan’t mitigate risk or move the growth needle in a meaningful way.\nNow that I’ve delivered my oratorical calling cards, the issue people care about most: rates. My\nown view is that we should hold firm, letting things settle and watching how events play out.\nAnd with that, I’ll to turn to the other topic on everyone’s mind.\n\n2\n\n\fWhat Just Happened?\nAs a quick recap: Last week, there was unusual stress in money markets, due primarily to funds\nflowing to the Treasury to meet corporate tax payments and settle Treasury security purchases.\nThere was a significant surge in repurchase — or “repo” — rates early in the week, which put\nupward pressure on the effective federal funds rate, and, in fact, pushed it above the top of the\ntarget range on Tuesday.\nWhile interest-rate control and market functions are obviously important issues, I want to\nreiterate my opening note that they neither reflect — nor direct — the stance of monetary\npolicy. Nor do they have implications for the wider economy.\nIt’s clear that last week’s episode was triggered by the outsized flows of private sector funds to\nthe Treasury. But the dates for tax payments and bond settlements are not a surprise; they are\nfixtures of the fiscal calendar and well known to both policymakers and markets. Everyone was\nexpecting large liquidity flows.\nThe impact, however, was clearly much larger than anyone anticipated, markets included.\nThe repo market took the brunt of the impact, as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)\nrose above 5 percent last Tuesday, with some trades executed at rates as high as 10 percent.\nWhile this was certainly not an average day, it’s important to note that the repo market didn’t\nfreeze. The volume of secured overnight finance remained steady, at the $1.2 trillion level it has\nmaintained for the past several months.\nThe funding pressures in secured markets passed through to the federal funds market. The\neffective federal funds rate rose to the top of target range on Monday the 16th, and surpassed\nthe top of the range by 5 basis points the next day.\nThat day, Tuesday, the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk started repurchase\noperations to stem the pressures on money markets, and continued them for the duration of\nthe week. Additionally, two technical adjustments were agreed upon at last week’s FOMC\nmeeting: First, the interest paid on reserves was set 20 basis points below the top of the target\n3\n\n\frange; and second, the overnight reverse repo rate was set 5 points below the bottom of the\ntarget range.\nThose measures successfully relieved funding pressures, and the effective fed funds not only\nmoved back within the target range, it came down to 10 basis points below the range’s ceiling\nthat Thursday and has remained there. Conditions started to normalize in repo markets as well,\nwith repo rates drifting lower on Thursday and Friday, and starting this week around 1.85\npercent. In fact, there was a significant drop in the fraction of volume in the federal funds\nmarket that traded at rates above the target range. For instance, less than 1 percent of the\ntotal fed funds volume was priced outside the target range.\nOn Friday, the Desk announced that it would initiate a series of repo operations — including\nseveral term operations — to help keep the fed funds rate within the target range. Those\noperations will continue until October 10. We have seen strong demand for repo operations\nthis week, possibly indicating that funding pressures may return on quarter-end, and the Desk\nstepped up the operation limits yesterday. As Chair Powell noted at the post-meeting press\nconference, we will continue to monitor market developments and adjust operations as\nnecessary to ensure that rates in the federal funds market stay within the target range.\nThe obvious question that arises — and indeed has been asked — is whether the current level\nof reserves is appropriate. And whether the Fed might need to expand its toolkit to better\nmanage interest rates.\nI don’t think we can adequately answer those questions without first taking a step back and\nseeing them in their wider context.\nAs you know, earlier this year, the FOMC decided that we would continue to conduct monetary\npolicy in a regime of “ample reserves,” in which control over the federal funds rate is exercised\nprimarily through the setting of administered rates, and the supply of reserves does not need to\nbe actively managed.\n\n4\n\n\fShortly after that, we announced our plan to cease asset redemptions and hold the balance\nsheet to roughly its post-redemption size. As currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow,\naggregate reserves see a natural, gradual decline. Our end game was for reserves to reach a\nlevel “consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.”\nThere were two primary objectives to this approach. First, to reduce uncertainty about asset\npurchases by announcing our plans well in advance. Second, to approach the necessary level of\nreserves, which is itself suffused with uncertainty, with an abundance of caution.\nWe only have estimates of the demand for reserves, though we’ve conducted a great deal of\nresearch around the Federal Reserve System, including continued conversation with market\nparticipants. In fact, staff at the Philadelphia and New York Feds were among the first to\nidentify that the need for reserves could be much larger than anticipated. To be on the safe\nside, it made sense to move slowly, buying time to carefully observe market developments and\nbetter assess their implications. That is, we gave ourselves time for the inevitable “unknown\nunknowns” of life — like the one that occurred last week, just to pick an entirely random\nexample. And in fact, while they may appear jarring in the moment, temporary episodes like\nthis offer a host of information and insight.\nIt is very possible that reserves are near, or approaching, their appropriate level — that it is, as\nthe Philadelphia and New York Feds’ research noted it might be — on the higher end of our\nestimates. If that is the case, we may need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet\nearlier than anticipated.\nWe will continue to monitor and assess money market conditions, and act as necessary to\nensure interest rate control. I think a central question is why the liquidity did not flow smoothly\nto where it was needed most.\nI’ll once again save you any suspense: I have more questions than answers. I think it’s important\nto avoid jumping to conclusions, and I certainly wouldn’t write any prescriptions — policy or\notherwise — before we know what ailed the markets.\n\n5\n\n\fIn the oft-used analogy of the money markets as plumbing, we should ask whether some pipes\nmight be rusty. Or clogged. Or if more might be needed.\nIt is also worth asking if regulation might be contributing to any erosion or blockage that might\nexist.\nThe second question is whether the Fed ought to expand our toolkit. As many of you will have\nnoted from the June FOMC minutes, there was a discussion about the possibility of a standingrepo facility. In theory, this could provide a backstop against unusual spikes in the federal funds\nand other money market rates. These discussions are in their infancy, and there is more work to\nbe done, particularly in considering how such a facility would be designed, what its objectives\nwould be, and what its net benefits would be relative to alternative approaches.\nConclusion\nAll in all, I see three key takeaways from this interlude. First, in the face of unexpected turmoil,\nthe Fed took swift and appropriate action, and it appears to be having the desired effect.\nSecond, the element of surprise suggests some deeper issues may be at play. And third, that\nthe Fed is committed to do what it takes to maintain interest rate control, and we will continue\nto keep a watchful eye.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning and welcome. I’m a big fan of bridging conversations across disciplines, so I want\nto applaud Larry and the team at the Consumer Finance Institute for pulling together such an\neclectic — and esteemed — group of experts, including my old friend and former colleague,\nColin Camerer.\nEconomics may be the dismal science, but it’s far from an exact one. And despite the myriad\ntools and equations at our disposal, there’s one remarkably unpredictable variable that forever\ncomplicates the results: human behavior. Neuroeconomics is relatively new territory, but it’s\nimportant to seek out new insights — in fact, we could use a little more of it. Given humanity’s\ninherently capricious nature, the more expertise and angles of analysis, the better. The richness\nof context it adds is more important now than ever, as the U.S. economy ventures into new\nterritory: As AI and machine learning fundamentally alter the unfolding employment landscape;\nas a new economic normal takes hold, even as a record-long expansion continues; and as many\nof our traditional models and modes of assessment have begun to lose their predictive and\nevaluative prowess.\nI have a background in engineering, so it’s in my DNA to take a step back every once in a while\nand reassess structures: Do we have all the information we need? Are we still using the right\n\n1\n\n\fmodels? Is there new analysis or insight that could make them more effective? And, crucially,\ndo we know what we don’t know?\nI’m not saying we should throw out the old tools. But I do think we should contextualize them\nin the light of new information. And I do think it’s important to solicit information from outside\ntraditional bounds.\nThe economy is not a fixed structure; it’s an ecosystem — a living, breathing organism informed\nby the people and entities that comprise it. As a policymaker, my judgment is influenced by the\nbehaviors and patterns I see as much as by economic orthodoxy. And at a time when far more\nof the variables appear to be uncertain — or unruly — new insights are especially valuable to\nthe discipline and study of economics.\nSo I’m very pleased that we could host this discussion today, and with that, let me turn the\nfloor over to Bob Hunt.\n\n2\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fIn Character We Trust\nCommencement Address\nABA Stonier Graduate School of Banking\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJune 13, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello Stonier, and congratulations! It’s great to be in front of this group again. For those of you\nwho don’t remember, I delivered the welcome address when you started this program three\nyears ago. I certainly understand if you’ve forgotten because a lot has happened since June\n2016. A lot.\nIn the intervening years, we’ve all had an education — you’ve mastered the intricacies of highlevel banking management; I learned from a crash course in monetary policymaking; and we all\nfinally, finally learned what it feels like to win a Super Bowl …\nSo I’m very pleased to bring this full circle and see you receive your diplomas.\nThe first order of business today is to give yourselves a round of applause. I like to do that\nbecause it’s important to recognize hard work, and because it guarantees people will clap at\nleast once while I’m on stage.\nThe second order of business is another round of applause to the people whose support helped\nmake this day happen … the friends, family, and faculty here today.\nFantastic! Now you’ve clapped twice while I was up here.\nThe third order of business is a few words about the importance of what you learned here at\nStonier, and what it means when you apply it in the professional world.\n\n1\n\n\fThe fourth is getting the actual diplomas, which is the most important, so I’ll keep the third part\nshortish.\nThe financial industry is only going to get more and more complicated and more and more\ncomplex, particularly in this current age of technological innovation. I say “current age” because\nof course, technology is always evolving and has already had several “ages,” as it will in the\nfuture.\nIn this iteration, financial institutions face challenges from cybersecurity to the rapid expansion\nof fintech.\nWe’re going to need people at the helm with an extraordinary set of skills, because financial\ninstitutions are important. And they’re always going to be important, because a financial\nsystem is fundamental to the human experience as we know it.\nI’m not saying that as some sort of consumerist rallying cry; it’s the simple fact of our existence.\nFinancial systems have existed in some form across human history.\nFrom the barter system to banking, societies spanning time and space have found ways to\nexecute the basic functions of payments, finance, and credit. It’s how we’ve amassed the things\nwe need to live and the things we crave for comfort.\nFrom the central agora to apps on our phones, whether it’s a creditor’s note or a series of 1s\nand 0s, the essentials of the system have stood the test of time. Each individual system, of\ncourse, has not necessarily been so lucky.\nBut that’s important, too. Because just as history illustrates that we’ll always find our way back\nto those systems, it shows what it takes for those systems to last.\nIt takes trust.\nA financial system can only exist if we collectively agree to it. That takes an act of faith. A\nsystem of savings, credit, exchange, and investment only survives because we have trust in\npeople we don’t know, currency we have no individual control over, payment systems with\n\n2\n\n\finner workings we can’t see, and institutions we grant power to — both to execute and to\nregulate those systems.\nAnd since a strong and sound economy can only exist when it’s underpinned by a strong and\nsound financial system, the people who run those institutions have a unique responsibility.\nSo, you know, no pressure.\nThat responsibility extends to institutions of all sizes. Bigger organizations can have impacts\nthat resonate on a national or even global scale. Smaller ones, particularly community banks,\ncan be a lifeline for a community, and are a necessity for small, local economies’ survival.\nOf course, you already know all this — I mean, you’re Stonier graduates, after all. But it’s a\npoint worth repeating every once in a while, because that kind of responsibility doesn’t just\nrequire a mastery of balance sheets or investment acumen.\nIt calls for good leadership. And that’s something I know Stonier excels at.\nWhen I spoke to you three years ago, I mentioned the importance of character. A lot may have\nchanged in the intervening years, but that hasn’t. I don’t think it ever will.\nThere’s a narrative — and, yes, sometimes a culture — in financial services that says cutthroat\nis king. I’ve spent a lot of my time as a Fed president talking to the banking community, and\nwhat I’ve seen and heard from them is the same thing I’ve seen in every other aspect of my\ncareer: The most respected leaders are honest, authentic, and trustworthy.\nSure, there are outliers; bad people can thrive, and flashes in the pan can last longer than they\nshould. But eventually, those people get found out. And in the long run, the most important\nasset any of us has — and the one thing in life we can control — is our integrity.\nWe don’t usually have a say in what life throws at us, but we do decide how we handle it. Our\nfinancial system needs people at the top who can roll with those changes and make the right\ncalls, even when they’re the hard ones.\nIn the end, the financial system exists to perform some pretty basic functions: It keeps savings\nsafe; ensures that we can easily price, buy, and sell things; and helps us direct resources to their\n3\n\n\fbest advantage. But what that actually means in our day-to-day lives is pretty huge: It’s how we\nget an education, or put a roof over our families’ heads. It’s how we start a business, or invest\nin our kids’ future. It’s how we get sustenance and fulfillment. There’s a lot riding on it, and a\nlot riding on the people who run it.\nIt’s a big job. It’s going to take some Stonier grads to do it right.\nThank you, and congratulations to everyone again.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fConversations with Superheroes\nRutgers University–Camden Commencement 2019\nCamden, NJ\nMay 22, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHello, Class of 2019 — and congratulations!\nI want to talk to you today about resilience. About hard work and perseverance. About people\nwho face challenges and overcome odds.\nYes, I’m talking about … me.\nSure, you guys have worked hard to get to graduation day, and this is an incredible moment for\nyou.\nBut do you have any idea, the pressures of the commencement circuit?!\nI mean, you’re probably asking yourself right now, “Who is this guy? Man, I wish I’d graduated\nin 2015.” You know who gave the commencement address in 2015? Jon Bon Jovi.\nHow am I supposed to top that?\nI could focus on giving a great speech, but that’s a high bar, too.\nPractical advice? The “always wear sunscreen” speech already won that category.\nJokes? I’m a Fed president. I have to be very careful about what I say, especially anything\npolitical. So, there goes most of the material.\nPlus ... I’m a Fed president. We are constitutionally unfunny.\nThat leaves me with the only category of commencement speeches left: inspiration.\n1\n\n\fThankfully, I have good material. Because all kidding aside, I do want to talk about resilience.\nBut I want to talk about yours.\nI have all the facts and figures on the Class of 2019. But I also have a particular insight on\nRutgers–Camden students because Chancellor Haddon is on the Philadelphia Fed’s board of\ndirectors.\nWe spend part of those meetings getting feedback from our directors on their industries and\nsectors. And along with the updates on fiscal issues and education trends, Phoebe never fails to\ntalk about her students. She never fails to emphasize just how hard you work, just how much of\nyourselves you put into your education, and just how much you give back to Camden.\nSo I could already infer a lot from what Google can tell me — this is an incredibly diverse\nstudent body that draws veteran, international, and first-generation students. You’re actively\nengaged with the city, and help make Rutgers–Camden an anchor institution. You’re out there\nworking, getting real-life experience. But I also know what I hear from the person who sees you\nevery day. And she confirms what I could infer: You are special.\nYou work hard. You live and study alongside people from totally different backgrounds. You’re\nout in the community, making a difference.\nAnd I know it’s not easy. Especially if you’re the first in the family to go to college. Especially if\nyou’re in a brand new country. Especially if you’re coming back to school or returning from\nmilitary service.\nThe word Phoebe uses most is “resilience.”\nWe’re in the middle of a long-overdue cultural conversation in this country about privilege.\nAbout the ways people are and aren’t afforded access. About how the accident of birth — who\nyou’re born to, where you’re born, and what body you’re born into — can give you an artificial\nhead start or unfairly put up roadblocks.\n\n2\n\n\fBut I want you to know, whatever privilege you may or may not have, whatever hurdles are or\naren’t in the way … that resilience you have? That’s an advantage that puts you 10 yards ahead\nof everyone else. That’s your superpower.\nThat resilience means you’ll survive disappointment, because it will come. And a lot of it will be\neven worse than having me as your commencement speaker when Colorado College got Oprah.\nThat resilience means you’ll know who you are — not every day, and not all the time, because\nlife isn’t that simple. But it will center you in times of doubt, and it will always lead you back to\nyourself.\nThat resilience means you’ll experience more joy, and more fulfillment, because you’ll know\nhow to see the true value of things. You’ll know substance means more than style and\nappreciate the small things in life — and you’ll understand that sometimes the little things\naren’t little at all.\nThat resilience means you’ll speak up, and you’ll show up. It means you’ll be there for other\npeople because you already know one of life’s most valuable lessons: No one does anything\nentirely on their own. It will give you the grace to share credit, and the humility to see others’\ncontributions.\nThat resilience makes you exceptional. Don’t ever doubt that, and don’t ever forget it.\nAnd I can’t wait for you to go out in the world and use your superpower. I can’t wait to see the\ngood you do and the change you unleash.\nAnd when one of you is standing where I am today, giving the commencement address to\nanother outstanding class of Rutgers–Camden graduates, I hope you’ll look back and take a few\nlessons from today:\nBe more famous than me — which shouldn’t be hard.\nTell better jokes than me — which should be easy.\nAnd if you can’t be famous, and you can’t be funny, be inspirational. Tell them how you used\nyour superpower. Tell them how you changed the world. Because I know you will. Thank you.\n3\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fHanging a Question Mark\nManagement Science’s 65th Anniversary Conference:\nInnovations in the Science and Practice of Management\nBoston University\nMay 20, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nSeeing the Forest for the Trees\nIt’s always a pleasure to be in Boston — such a pleasure, in fact, that I can even forget it’s\nPatriots territory. As an Eagles fan, I learned an interesting equation last year: The joy of\nwinning is inversely proportionate to the frequency of winning. So it’s comforting to think that\nwhile Pats fans have probably already forgotten this year’s win, we’ll still be celebrating well\ninto our 90s …\nSpeaking of celebrating, I want to wish a happy anniversary to Management Science for its 65\nyears. I was honored that David asked me to speak on the occasion, and very happy to oblige.\nWhat caught my attention in particular was the emphasis on integrating theory and practice,\nbecause they live on opposite ends of the spectrum far too often, and there’s not much use for\na seemingly perfect model that crumbles under real-world conditions.\nI speak from experience. It’s happened to me more times than I care to remember. As a young\ncivil engineer, designing what I thought was an indestructible bridge, only to see it collapse in\nthe testing lab. As a not-so-young university president, watching the economy plummet in the\nwake of the financial crisis, taking our sublime three-year strategic plan with it. In a host of\nmanagement positions, introducing structural change, only to find that the organism most\nresistant to change is an organization’s culture.\n1\n\n\fSo I’m very pleased to have the opportunity to compare notes, and war stories, of theory gone\nwrong in practice.\nBefore I do, however, I’ll issue the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nAny time you’re dealing with complex structures — in engineering, in operations, in policy —\nit’s important to take a step back every once in a while to be sure you’re seeing the forest for\nthe trees. And the more intricate the machine, the more necessary that reevaluation is.\nBecause with so many interdependent parts — built on top of, or intertwined with, each other\n— there’s risk to the whole structure if one of those pieces isn’t working.\nSo it makes sense to kick the tires every now and again.\nOr, in the words of Bertrand Russell, “to hang a question mark on the things you have long\ntaken for granted.”\nIn the case of management science and operations research, I think the first principles we have\nto revisit are whether we’re using the right tools for the right jobs, and whether we’ve designed\nthem with the right users in mind.\nThe Fallibility of Models\nThere are incredible opportunities from the advances we’re seeing in management decisionmaking — particularly when it’s enabled by technology — but there are downsides as well.\nThat’s the case with any complex system, especially ones that are programmatic.\nTake fintech, where streamlined processes have expanded the opportunities for smaller loans,\nfaster approvals, and greater market reach and penetration. But there’s a downside to\nalgorithmic lending. Even in its early stages, we’re seeing discrimination in selection.\nI think the overall risk to any complex system, whether it’s technology based or not, lies in\nmoving too far toward process and away from critical thinking.\nIn my experience, you run into trouble when you start thinking your model can do all the work.\n\n2\n\n\fTo give a non-tech-based example: Every once in a while, a discussion pops up about shifting\nmonetary policy to a rules-based regime, essentially advocating for the automation of the\nFOMC. That regime would put decisions on autopilot, without human intervention or judgment\nfactoring into the equation. And while those rules are important, and inform a lot of our\ndecisions, they shouldn’t be followed robotically.\nIt’s important to know what you don’t know. Complete control only works in a system where all\nthe variables are known entities. One of my first engineering jobs was designing control\nsystems for trains. That’s an operation that can be set on autopilot. We can control the trains.\nWe can see the layout of the tracks. We know where they’ll be and when they’ll be there.\nIn other words, we know everything we need to know to keep them from running into each\nother.\nMonetary policy isn’t that precise. Despite some of the smartest thinkers and the best models,\nwe can’t assign a degree of certainty to any of the variables.\nWe’re not 100 percent sure what inflation is. We can only estimate the natural rate of\nunemployment when it’s in the rearview mirror — and even then, we don’t universally agree.\nProductivity is notoriously difficult to measure, and that affects our understanding of GDP\ngrowth.\nTo operate monetary policy mechanically, we’d need a level of accuracy that just isn’t possible.\nWe’d need a lot more data, a lot more frequently, with a lot more precision than the laws of\neconomics allow.\nThe Taylor rule is an extraordinary contribution to the economics profession. But I wouldn’t get\non a train that’s run by it.\nHumanity’s Competitive Edge\nMonetary policy should be more like a suspension bridge, with flexibility built into the design. It\nhas a core structure, but it can bend to account for real-world events.\n\n3\n\n\fOne of the reasons monetary policy can’t just be mechanized is that decisions have to be\ninformed by human experience and past behavior — as in any discipline, models may work in\ntheory, but not necessarily under the messy complication of real-life conditions.\nIf the Fed had followed the regime that some advocate, interest rates would have risen by\nseveral percentage points in the years following the Great Recession. Instead, models provided\nguidance, but people made the judgment — and wherever you place yourself on the ideological\npolicy spectrum, I don’t think anyone would argue for high rates in a slow recovery.\nAt the heart of this is what can and can’t be mechanized. Some things just require human\ninsight.\nAutomation in general has been the subject of a lot of conversation recently, particularly in the\ncontext of how it’s affecting the employment landscape. Whether it’s policy decisions,\nmanagement models, or the workplace, the underlying lesson is the same: There are some\nthings technology can’t do. The things that make us quintessentially human can’t be replicated\nor automated, because machines can’t think. Artificial intelligence is only as smart as the data\nwe input. Models are only as effective as we make them.\nSo looking at the future of management science, I think success lies in approaches that\nemphasize the human component as much as, if not more than, the programmatic.\nThat’s actually grounded in the profession’s genesis.\nOperations research was born of World War II, when the British and U.S. militaries tapped the\nscientific community for their expertise in processes, models, and analysis. There’s no question\nthat deploying data analytics to the battlefield contributed to the Allied victory, whether\nthrough strategically allocating weaponry and resources, breaking codes, or building networks.\nIf there’s any area that’s subject to the unexpected, it’s the theater of war. And while adding\nthe scientific, algorithmic component was crucial to success, so was human judgment.\n\n4\n\n\fWhen the war ended, it seemed clear to researchers that the techniques could be beneficial in\nthe civilian world, as companies and organizations grew larger and more complex, and the\nadvent of the computer age was ushered in.\nWhen the journal launched 65 years ago, the discipline was still in its infancy, but it had\nundergone incredibly rapid development in the years after the war.\nThat era is often characterized by the popular culture of the time. And, in fact, 1954 was the\nyear that Elvis recorded his debut album, On the Waterfront was in theaters, and families\nacross the country tuned in to Father Knows Best. At its scheduled time — there were no\ncommercial-free streaming plans — and on an actual television — which was roughly the size\nand weight of a small rhinoceros.\nThat all looks especially quaint from the vantage of 2019. But it was, in fact, a time of incredible\nchange — socially, economically, and technologically — and the post-War boom fundamentally\nchanged the business landscape. Which is likely what sped the development of management\nscience as a discipline.\nOvercorrecting the Pendulum Swings\nWe’re in a similar situation now, as innovation in all sectors hits a rapid pace.\nAs a species, we tend to overreact to pendulum swings — sometimes to correct for them, and\nsometimes to keep pace with them. Technology has evolved so quickly that it’s become the\ndefault mode to digitize it if we can, without considering if we should.\nThe all-robot hotel in Japan comes to mind — not only could half the mechanized staff not\nperform their basic functions, the entire fleet was dependent on human assistance and\nmaintenance.\nI should make clear that this isn’t a cranky, get-off-my-lawn rant about technology. I am wholly\nin favor of technological advancement and innovation. It’s fundamental to the American\neconomy, and it’s something we do exceptionally well. It’s connected us to one another in a\n\n5\n\n\fway that would’ve been unimaginable even a decade or two ago. It’s made life easier, and\nbetter, for the vast majority of people.\nWhat I am saying is that we should put it to its best use.\nOperations research deals with incredibly complex systems populated by incredibly\ncomplicated entities: human beings. Both the theory and the practice should take a step back,\nkick the tires, and be sure they’re using the right tools — technological or otherwise — for the\nright jobs.\nNow is a good time for that, because the overall race forward in technological capability is\ngoing to complicate the workplace even more. And in an increasingly tight labor market, it’s\nmore important than ever to think about who, and how, organizations hire.\nAs technology advances, the underlying skills that make workers adaptable — the “soft skills”\nlike creativity, communication, critical thinking — are going to be more important than a\nchecklist. No single competence is going to survive that evolution.\nInstead, the best candidates will have a core set of skills that can evolve with the market, and\nwe’ll likely see an overall shift to constant training and continuing education.\nExisting professionals will need continual upskilling, whether it’s to keep up with industry\nstandards or just learn the office’s new software. People preparing for the workforce will need\nboth proficiency in current programs and to develop skills that will help them adapt with the\ntechnology as it evolves.\nFrom the employers’ end, that means investing in the workforce and committing to lifelong\nlearning. Simply replacing outdated skills with new ones just isn’t efficient or cost effective, and\nit may not even be enough — they’ll need workers who can adapt to a dynamic and regularly\nchanging environment, and that means investing in people.\nThe End … or the Beginning?\nEducation institutions will also need to consider new models, not just because technology is\nforcing it, but because they’ll be in a position to offer the lifelong learning that workers need.\n6\n\n\fThe changes happening in the workforce pose both opportunities and risks. On either side, it\nsignals very interesting times coming our way.\nI think this time of increasing automation and computerization will only emphasize the\nimportance of an array of skills, and add richness to the management science profession.\nAnd as we continue the research and execute the practice, I hope we’ll remember to take the\nodd step back, every once in a while, to hang that question mark on our assumptions. Just to be\nsure.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fMonetary Policy Listening Tour\nFed Listens: Education, Employment, and Monetary Policy in the Third District\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMay 17, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIt’s a pleasure to welcome everyone to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Fed speakers\nusually start off with a standard disclaimer that we’re speaking for ourselves, not for anyone\nelse in the Fed System. But I’ll break that sacred vow to say on behalf of all my colleagues that\nwe’re very pleased that you’re joining us today.\nWho says policymakers don’t live dangerously?\nI want to extend an extra thanks for being here, because I know a lot of people wondered what\na discussion of monetary policy had to do with them. It’s a question our team heard more than\nonce, and it’s a fair one.\nThere are two parts to the answer. First, you are the economy. The American economy is the\nbiggest, most diverse on earth, but at its heart, it’s a collection of micro-economies made up of\npeople and businesses and communities — it’s you and your neighbors. And you’re the people\nwe conduct monetary policy for.\nSecond, we rely on feedback. Sure, we spend a lot of time looking at the myriad graphs and\ncharts and alphabet soup of equations you’d expect. But the views and experiences of people\nand businesses across our communities are also crucial components of how we measure the\nhealth of the American economy.\n1\n\n\fThose conversations are a regular part of how we collect and assess data. But this event is\nsomething different. It’s part of a larger listening tour that’s really about making sure we’ve got\nthe right goals in place; that we’re still measuring the right things, and that the tools we use are\nstill the best ones for the job.\nBefore I introduce our guest and get the afternoon underway, I want to take a moment to give\nthe Fed primer to put these discussions in context.\nThe Federal Reserve can be a mysterious being. It’s a complex system used to doing its job out\nof the limelight, and it’s not just the average person on the street who would struggle to explain\nits various functions.\nWhen I first joined the Philadelphia Fed’s board of directors, I was honestly surprised at how\nmuch about the Federal Reserve I didn’t know. So the Fed 101 is not because I think anyone\nhere is lacking in general knowledge; it’s because I know from experience.\nThe Federal Reserve System\nSo first, the structure.\nAt the center is the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., which is what most people think of\nwhen they hear “The Fed.” The Board has seven governors’ seats, including Vice Chair Clarida,\nwho’s joined us today and who is the driving force behind this listening tour.\nBut there are also the 12 District Banks around the country, including the one we’re in today,\neach an independent entity with its own president and board of directors.\nThe governors and presidents come together every six weeks or so in D.C. for a meeting of the\nFederal Open Market Committee — or FOMC — to discuss, and vote on, monetary policy. The\ngovernors and the president of the New York Fed are all permanent voters, while the rest of us\nrotate into position every few years. My first turn was in 2017, and I’ll be back in the saddle\nnext year.\nOne of the things that surprised me most when I first got to the FOMC is that you honestly can’t\ntell who’s a voter and who’s not until the last 30 seconds of a two-day meeting. Everyone is\n2\n\n\fequally involved in the debate and discussion. That’s an important detail, and it goes back to\nthe way we’re organized.\nThe Fed’s structure is an outlier; you don’t see it in other countries, and it’s something I think of\nas uniquely American: a decentralized central bank. I also think it’s the key ingredient in making\nthe best possible policy for the country.\nFirst and foremost, it gives vastly different communities a seat at the table and a voice in\ndiscussions.\nWe’re making monetary policy on a national level, and the size and scope of the U.S. economy\ncan flatten the peaks and valleys we see in different areas. Seattle’s economic reality is vastly\ndifferent than Camden’s, and the Fed’s unique structure makes sure we consider both.\nOur structure also helps to guard against groupthink. There’s an added richness to the\ndiscussions, because the people around the table have different backgrounds, different ways of\nlooking at the data, and different priorities in economic outcomes. It’s true that we could be\nmore diverse, and that’s something we’re working on. But even in our present state, there’s a\nmultitude of opinion, and the wants and needs of incredibly varied constituencies are\nrepresented.\nHaving a federated system also adds to our overall independence. While the Fed was created\nby and is answerable to Congress, we’re an independent entity, which shields us from political\npressure. That’s crucial to making good decisions. Monetary policy takes a while to work, and\nbeing free from outside influence allows us to make thoughtful, data-driven decisions about the\nmedium term.\nMonetary Policy\nSo that’s the form; what about the function?\nThe Fed is, of course, the nation’s central bank. We also regulate banks, process payments,\nconduct economic research, and work within our Districts to help strengthen local\ncommunities’ economies.\n3\n\n\fDifferent banks also specialize in particular research areas: Dallas has expertise in energy, for\ninstance, while New York is the go-to for financial markets. Here in Philadelphia, our focus is on\nconsumer credit.\nAnd, the subject we’re here to discuss today: We set monetary policy to meet the goals laid out\nfor us by Congress: maximum employment and price stability.\nIn their very simplest terms — with apologies to the economists in the room, who do not enjoy\nreducing things to their simplest terms — maximum employment means that if you’re looking\nfor a job, you can find one relatively easily. That comes with some caveats, of course, including\nthat it doesn’t necessarily mean the job you get will be the job you want. Price stability is low\nand stable inflation — enough for prices to grow at a healthy pace without devaluing the\nmoney in your bank account. Our current target is 2 percent.\nWhen we talk about monetary policy, it’s worth outlining not just what it can do, but what it\ncan’t.\nMonetary policy isn’t all powerful. It’s a relatively limited set of fairly blunt tools, and it has a\npretty narrow scope. In normal times, monetary policy is mostly raising and lowering interest\nrates — or keeping them the same.\nIn extraordinary times, we may use tools like quantitative easing or forward guidance — which\nis just policyspeak for telling people what to expect. But the majority of what we do is the\nsomewhat boring business of keeping rates at a level that encourages a healthy economy and\nhelps us meet our dual mandate.\nI’m often asked about aspects of the American economy that affect our work, but that we don’t\nactually have any control over. Fiscal policy, for instance, which deals with debts, deficits, and\ntaxes. Or things that take legislative action, like investments to encourage growth or programs\nto spur job creation.\nOur job is to create the conditions for a healthy economy to thrive. We till the land and make\nthe soil fertile, if you will. But the actual thriving part — planting the seeds and tending the\ncrops — take fiscal and other policy.\n4\n\n\fSo if it’s limited, why are we here today?\nBecause those grounding conditions — maximum employment and price stability — are crucial,\nand we want to be sure our targets, processes, and tools are still the right ones. We want to be\nsure we’re thinking about policy the right way.\nPart of coming to that conclusion is hearing from you. How you’re experiencing the job market.\nHow you’re feeling inflation. What challenges you’re seeing in your communities.\nBecause, again, you are the economy; you’re the reason we make policy in the first place.\nI want to turn it over now to Vice Chair Clarida, who, as I mentioned, is the driving force behind\nthese listening sessions.\nThank you.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fThe Fed’s Balance Sheet\nThe 37th Annual Monetary and Trade Conference\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMay 6, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nGood morning and thank you; it’s a pleasure to be here.\nThe tagline of this conference is Global Trade: Darkening Clouds or New Beginnings? And I want\nyou to know that I valiantly resisted the temptation to make a bad joke — or worse, a pun —\ninvolving Churchill’s “beginning of the end” or “end of the beginning.” But there are some\nechoes of its essence in the subject of my remarks today. Life — and policy — is full of endings\nand beginnings that are part of a larger whole. So I’d like to talk today about the continuing\nprocess of normalizing monetary policy, and the unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet. If I were\ngoing to give in to the urge to make that joke, I might call it the beginning of the end of the\nmiddle of the end of the almost end of our road to normal. … But, of course, I would never do\nthat.\nI will, however, add to my remarks a brief outlook on how I see the economy unfolding and\nwhat that means for my policy views. I’m approaching my four-year anniversary as a Fed\npresident, and one of the first lessons I learned on taking that seat was to always give an\neconomic outlook. Another was to always preface any remarks with the standard Fed\ndisclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n1\n\n\fOutlook\nStarting with GDP, the initial readings of Q1 were a pleasant surprise, particularly as first\nquarters have tended to be slow in recent years. However, there are a few caveats. A good\nchunk of that boost came from inventories and net exports, which are unlikely to carry into the\nrest of the year. It’s possible that the drag we usually see in first quarters will show up in Q2 this\nyear, as inventories in particular tend to counter large boosts today with a drag tomorrow.\nConsumer spending, which has been the primary driver of growth, showed a slowdown from\nlast year, as did business investment.\nThe net result of these components means my outlook for growth this year remains the same\nfor now: a little above 2 percent. I also continue to see next year returning to trend, at about 2\npercent.\nThe labor market continues to show remarkable strength, with strong job creation and\ncontinued low unemployment. I think the unemployment rate could move down even further,\nto 3.5 percent before edging back up a few tenths of a percentage point.\nInflation has softened in recent months, and it’s an area I’m focusing my attention on. I haven’t\nyet revised my medium-term inflation forecast, because I suspect some of the recent weakness\nis transitory. So I still see it running slightly above our 2 percent target for the medium term,\nbut that projection is nowhere near written in stone; more like a dry-erase board.\nIf any component of the outlook were to affect my view on the appropriate path of monetary\npolicy, it would be inflation. However, we’re not there yet, and it would take more data to\nconvince me. I therefore continue to see one increase at most this year; possibly one, at most,\nnext.\nUnwinding the Balance Sheet\nTurning to the crux of my remarks today, as you know, the FOMC has made further moves\nregarding the balance sheet, which were laid out in its updates to the “normalization principles\nand plans” after our January and March meetings. There are three interrelated components to\nthis. First, continued implementation of monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves. Second,\n2\n\n\four intent to stop asset redemptions in September. And third, the anticipation that the size of\nthe balance sheet will be constant for some time after that, letting the supply of reserves\ndecline, very gradually, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow.\nTo clarify the Fed-speak, “monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves” means that policy will\nbe executed as it is in normal times, with the federal funds rate acting as our primary tool. The\nfed funds, along with other short-term rates, will be managed mainly via administered rates,\nsuch as interest on reserves.\n“Amplitude,” of course, can sound quite nebulous, but in the case of the fed funds market, “an\nample supply of reserves” has a specific meaning: a level of aggregate reserves that can\ncomfortably accommodate demand within our target range through all the volatility associated\nwith seasonal demand and autonomous factors, without requiring active management. This\nmeans that, as long as economic and financial conditions unfold more or less as we expect\nthem to, the balance sheet will remain largely on autopilot, left in the background, as boring as\never. While the current state of reserves certainly falls within that definition, the Committee\nhas also made clear that we ultimately intend to hold no more reserves than necessary for\nefficient and effective monetary policy. I’m going to revisit that expression quite a few times, so\nit’s probably best if everyone adds mental quotation marks around “no more than necessary”\nand “efficient and effective” — I promise it reflects my adherence to careful policy wording,\nrather than a lack of imagination. Or a thesaurus.\nAs we’ve announced, our plan is to end the balance sheet runoff in September. Starting this\nmonth, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from $30 billion a month to $15\nbillion, to put a modest damper on the pace of redemptions.\nWhen the runoff ends, reserves will likely still be somewhat more than necessary for that\n“efficient and effective” execution, rather than no more than necessary. Therefore, we intend\nto hold the size of the balance sheet roughly constant for a time. By doing so, we will let the\nsupply of reserves decline gradually with growth in currency and other non-reserve liabilities.\nFor me, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, and that\nuncertainty calls for a cautious approach. It may be that “ample” is more than we thought, and\n3\n\n\freserve levels can’t really drop much further without inflicting interest rate volatility and\ncreating liquidity-management issues for financial institutions.\nAdditionally, the supply of reserves is notoriously volatile. Autonomous factors, such as the\nTreasury General Account and repo facilities, can move the aggregate supply of reserves by as\nmuch as $90 billion in either direction in a single week. We have a good track record of\nforecasting these swings, and they do tend to reverse themselves. But those factors do inflict a\nsubstantial fluctuation in the supply of reserves to depository institutions.\nSo in metaphorical terms, it is a dark and stormy night, to quote Peanuts, and we are walking in\nthe direction of a wall. In that situation, most of us would give the advice of “walk, don’t run,”\nand keep a bit of distance from where we think the wall is.\nWalk, Don’t Run\nSo we intend to walk toward the “efficient and effective” level, rather than charging at full\nspeed.\nThe plan is to slow down the pace of decline in average reserves. We’ll do that by keeping the\nsize of our aggregate securities holdings constant for a time. During this period, we will see a\nvery — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease in average reserves as currency and other\nnon-reserve liabilities grow over time. Average currency growth rarely exceeds $10 billion per\nmonth, while asset redemptions have averaged more than $30 billion a month. That said, more\nthan half of the decline realized to date was unrelated to asset redemptions, and reserves have\ndeclined by more than $1 trillion since their peak of $2.8 trillion.\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia staff,1 is not only\nthe safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of\nasset redemptions. In fact, it effectively decouples asset and liability policies as we make our\nway to “no more than necessary.” It also gives us additional time for monitoring and analysis,\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n\n4\n\n\fand may even foster changes to how financial institutions manage liquidity. These factors both\nmeet the FOMC’s stated objective to proceed in a “gradual and predictable manner.”\nKeeping the Distance\nWe also want to keep a comfortable distance to avoid a collision with the wall. As I said, we\nonly have estimates of the demand for reserves, and the parameters of “ample” may be closer\nthan we think. Those autonomous factors I mentioned add something of a howling wind to our\nmetaphorical late-night excursion, because their volatile effect makes it similarly difficult to\nnavigate a narrow path for aggregate reserves. Both considerations call for additional aggregate\nreserves, creating a buffer zone to account for margins of error in our estimates and protect\nagainst large swings in autonomous factors.\nA Little More Normalizing\nAs reserves continue to decline, they will eventually reach their efficient and effective level, at\nwhich point we’ll resume asset purchases to maintain that level, keeping up with nominal\ngrowth.\nEven at that point, though, we will not be “normalization accomplished” — though we will be\nnormalization adjacent.\nBecause the next natural step in the balance sheet discussion is its composition.\nOnce the balance sheet’s holdings do not exceed the need, they’re unlikely to meet the want —\nat least not that of the long run. The FOMC has made clear that the portfolio will consist\nprimarily of Treasuries, but currently, MBS account for more than 40 percent. There are no\nTreasury bills, and our Treasury holdings have a substantially longer remaining maturity than\noutstanding Treasury securities. While a significant number of Treasuries will reach maturity in\nthe coming years, a sizable share has a remaining lifetime of 20 years or more.\nAs we discuss the question of composition, it’s worth returning to the Rosetta Stone of\npolicyspeak, particularly when we talk about the “longer run.” The transition could easily take\nclose to a decade, even if economic and financial conditions unfold as expected. Balance sheet\n5\n\n\fpolicies are inherently asymmetrical — that is, they are deployed when we need more\naccommodation than rates alone can deliver, never the other way around — so the portfolio\ncomposition will never average “normal” nor, in fact, will it be “normal” on anything like a\nregular basis.\nWhile the longer run can be something of an amorphous concept, the near term is more\nconcrete, and poses pressing questions. There will need to be decisions about how to distribute\nreinvestments and, eventually, outright asset purchases. Importantly, those decisions can have\nan immediate impact, and will need to be communicated clearly, as they will almost certainly\nbe the subject of intense market attention.\nI’m not going to weigh in on the functions, but I will say something about the philosophy.\nFor me, any discussion of composition has to be predicated on a set of grounding principles.\nWhile there are certainly more than just these two to consider, I would start with the doctrines\nof neutrality and flexibility.\nNeutrality is grounded in the monetary policymaker’s Hippocratic Oath of doing no harm. In this\ncase, our plans should avoid market disruptions. One way to do that is ensuring we spread\nholdings and purchases across maturities in proportion to their amount outstanding, avoiding\ncornering any one particular issue. In particular, recently issued Treasuries — often referred to\nas “on the run” — are vital to market functioning.\nFlexibility involves the crucial ability to dip into our arsenal of balance sheet policies if the need\narises. I want to stress that we would only revisit those options if we again found ourselves in a\nsituation that called for more accommodation than the federal funds rate could provide on its\nown. But it is important to maintain that ability. One way to increase flexibility is by changing\nthe maturity of the balance sheet’s composition. The shorter the duration of the portfolio, the\nlarger the flow of maturing proceeds at any given time. That flow can be redirected, allowing\nfor a swift change in the composition without expanding the balance sheet or having to sell\nassets outright.\n\n6\n\n\fOne option, therefore, would be tilting the Treasury portfolio toward a somewhat shorter term.\nThat could be done by simply increasing our holdings of Treasury bills, which have a maturity of\na year or less.\nIt’s important to note that there are many discussions still to be had, and that these principles\nare but two of many. Important ones, but in good company.\nFinally, it is worth repeating that the normalization process, while an important policy decision,\nis not indicative of our monetary policy stance.\nConclusion\nAnd so I come to the beginning of the end of my remarks.\nWe are on the path to normalization, though when this next step is complete, there will still be\nmore to take. The conversations will continue, particularly about composition, and for me, the\nprinciples of neutrality and flexibility will be key.\nWith that, the end of my remarks and the beginning of the Q&A.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fA Brief History of the Fed Universe\nGreater Vineland Chamber of Commerce\nVineland, NJ\nApril 17, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nBefore I begin, I’d like to do two things.\nFirst, I want to congratulate the Chamber on its centennial year — happy anniversary.\nSecond, I want to address the elephant in the room. It might be better to avoid such a divisive\nsubject in these polarized times, but I think it’s better to face controversy head-on. So I venture\nin, bravely posing the question: Is Vineland the dandelion capital of the country or the egg\ncapital?\nThis has been a subject of internal debate at the Philadelphia Fed for weeks now, and Wikipedia\nsupports both camps.\nSo please, by a show of hands, help us start the healing: dandelion or egg?\nNow that that’s settled, I’ll turn to something almost as important: the economy.\nAt an event like this, I’d normally give an economic update and discuss what that means for my\npolicy outlook, and I intend to do that. But I’ve also been asked to give a Fed primer for anyone\nwho’s not 100 percent familiar with the history and functions of the Federal Reserve. If you\ncount yourself among them, you’re in very good company. It can be a byzantine and\ncomplicated system, and I remember being surprised, as a newly minted member of the board\nof directors, at the scope of the Fed’s work — it’s more than just interest rates.\n\n1\n\n\fWith that in mind, I’ll give a quick intro to how the Federal Reserve came to be and what it is\nwe do, then give the requisite outlook with some added context.\nAnd I will start with the most important aspect of Fed history and tradition, which is the\nstandard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Federal Reserve System\nWith that done, a brief history. It’s probably safe to say that a central bank like the Federal\nReserve could only happen in America. That’s because its structure reflects a deep and longstanding battle of ideological wills that are foundational to our national existence.\nThe Fed has only existed for a little over a century. Compare that with the Bank of England,\nwhich has been around since 1694, or the Riksbank, Sweden’s national bank, which was\nestablished a few decades before that. Of course, those were sovereign nations much earlier\nthan we were, but the Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913 — not exactly the dawn of the\nrepublic. So why is that?\nWithout going too far down the historical rabbit hole, there were, in fact, attempts — and\nsuccesses — at central banking in the United States before the Fed. But their rise and fall\nreflected those competing ideological forces: On one side were those who wanted the stability\nand economic advantage wrought by a central bank, while the other housed those who\nfundamentally distrusted centralized power. This was at the heart of our founding: Federalism\nand Republicanism. Hamilton and Jefferson. Dandelion and egg.\nBefore the 20th century, we had two real central banking successes — both in Philadelphia, by\nthe way — which we imaginatively refer to as the First and Second Banks of the United States.\nBoth had 20-year charters when they were established, and both faced political climates that\nwere hostile to their renewal when the time came — which meant both were left to expire.\nThat philosophical tension never went away. But in the late 1800s, a series of booms and busts\nculminated in the Panic of 1907, and the need for a central bank became clear. The Federal\nReserve was born.\n2\n\n\fAgain, I will spare you the extensive details, but the important part is the result: a decentralized\ncentral bank. A compromise between those two underpinning viewpoints.\nAt its center is the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., which is where the Chair sits and is\nwhat most people think of when they hear “The Fed.” But there are also 12 District Banks\naround the country, each an independent entity with its own president and board of directors.\nPeople often ask what it’s like to work for Jay Powell, or Janet Yellen before him. But the thing\nis, I don’t. I work for our board and our District.\nThat unique Fed structure gives us a better view of the realities on the ground — the United\nStates is a vast and complicated economic machine, but it is fundamentally made up of a\ncollection of micro-economies across the cities, towns, and communities that blanket the\ncountry.\nThe regional Banks bring the viewpoints of our Districts when we meet in D.C. to formulate\nmonetary policy, which we do roughly every six weeks at the Federal Open Market Committee,\nor FOMC. Again, that local perspective is crucial, because we’re making policy at a national\nlevel, and the size and scope of the U.S. economy can flatten the peaks and valleys we see in\ndifferent areas.\nIn those meetings, we discuss monetary policy and, at the end, we vote. The governors are\npermanently in a voting position, as is the president of the New York Fed. The rest of us rotate\nin — I’m up in 2020, and despite the fact that you’d never know who’s in rotation until the last\n30 seconds of a two-day meeting, people will be a lot more interested in what I have to say\ncome January …\nCongress outlined a “dual mandate” of price stability and maximum employment for the\nFederal Reserve, which is again unusual for central banks, most of which focus solely on\ninflation. The Fed also regulates banks, processes payments, and conducts economic research.\nAnd — the part that never gets enough attention, in my opinion — we do research and work to\nhelp strengthen our local economies. As I said, each of the Banks are independent entities,\nwhich means we have the freedom to tailor our work to our own area’s needs. While all Feds\n3\n\n\fhave a community development function, each of us executes it in a different way. At the\nPhiladelphia Fed, we’ve created the Economic Growth & Mobility Project (EGMP), which\nfocuses on what we think are the three foundational aspects of economic mobility: job creation\n— that is, stable, well-paid jobs that lead to financial security; workforce development — that\nis, education and training for people to get those jobs; and infrastructure, which includes\neverything from housing to transportation to broadband.\nThe Fed can’t make grants or finance projects; it’s not in our congressional remit. What we can\ndo is bring people together and offer sound research. So with the EGMP, we’re forming\npartnerships around our District to help address systemic issues in what we call Research in\nAction Labs.\nThe first of those was in northeastern Pennsylvania, where they did have one of those three\npillars — a lot of jobs at fulfillment centers — but were struggling with another: infrastructure.\nThose centers are located outside of town, and the region was built like most of America in the\nlatter half of the 20th century: constructed to bring commuters from the suburbs and outskirts\ninto the city, not the other way around. So we worked with local partners, and they came up\nwith a collective set of solutions that worked for them — launching pilot programs, establishing\na council on equitable transit, and making transportation a priority in the area.\nThat part is crucial: The Fed can offer research, data, and support, but communities are the\nones that understand their own unique needs. Our job is to offer our research and convening\npower, and to share projects’ data and results with anyone who might benefit. We’ve already\nheard from communities that have issues similar to northeastern Pennsylvania, asking how they\ncan do something similar. Now that we’ve helped with the program, we can share a blueprint.\nDifferent Banks also sometimes specialize in particular research areas. Obviously, Dallas does a\nlot on energy markets. New York has a special focus on international financial markets. In\nPhiladelphia, our area of expertise is consumer credit: cards, household debt, student loans,\netc.\nSo that’s the Fed overview. We do a lot of things other than monetary policy.\n\n4\n\n\fFor instance, we use our research to share our economic outlooks.\nThe Outlook\nTurning to the first part of our mandate, “maximum employment” means, more or less, that if\nyou’re looking for a job, you can find one relatively easily. That comes with some caveats,\nincluding that it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll find the job you want, and, obviously, this is\nnowhere near a technical term. In fact, somewhere, a cold shiver just ran down an economist’s\nspine … But by a colloquial measure, that’s what we mean.\nThe unemployment rate will never be zero. People naturally leave jobs and come in and out of\nthe labor force, and we expect some level of unemployment to reflect that. We think about a\nsort of happy medium, where jobs are available but not so abundant that it starts to put\nupward pressure on inflation; we refer to this as the “natural rate” of unemployment. It’s\nimportant to note that the natural rate is elusive – it’s more easily evaluated in the rearview\nmirror, and even then it’s not concrete enough for consensus, but we do have estimates. Most\neconomists currently put that measure somewhere around 4½ percent. So by contrast, the\ncurrent unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is relatively low. I actually see that rate moving\nfurther down this year — somewhere around the 3½ percent range — before edging back up a\nfew tenths of a percentage point.\nJob creation is another metric that garners a lot of attention, and the last two months’ data\ndefinitely made a few headlines. February’s initial number made headlines at 20,000 — though\nit’s now been revised up to 33,000 — because it was much lower than expected, and much,\nmuch lower than other months. March, on the other hand, was a robust 190,000 — which has\nbeen more or less the average number over the last half-year or so.\nThese numbers illustrate the persistent Fed mantra of data dependency. First, it’s important to\ntake a medium-term view, and not let one report or data series derail an outlook. Second, the\ndismal science is not exact. If you look at economic predictions from a year or two ago, a lot of\nthem had job creation slowing significantly by now — my own included. But the labor market\nhas shown remarkable strength, and its continued tightening has surprised a lot of experts. So\n\n5\n\n\fit’s important to be patient as the data roll in, and not jump to conclusions on the basis of one\nround — or even a generally agreed-upon prediction. We want the data to confirm it.\nTurning to price stability, the Fed has a goal of 2 percent inflation. That’s enough for the\neconomy to grow at a healthy pace without price changes causing discernable friction in the\neconomy.\nAfter several years of running persistently below our preferred 2 percent target, inflation finally\nstarted running about that rate. In recent months, it’s edged back down somewhat.\nI see inflation averaging slightly higher than 2 percent this year and next. Again, my focus is on\nthe medium-term average, and what I’m watching in particular is inflation’s trajectory — that\nis, not just its direction, but the speed at which it travels.\nAs with all things policy related, I’ll be driven by the data. In particular, I’m giving weight to core\ninflation for a better view of the fundamentals, as fluctuations in energy prices are likely to\naffect the headline metric.\nTurning finally to GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for 2019, and around 2 percent next\nyear, which I see as trend.\nThat number is disappointing to a lot of people. But it’s important to remember that we’re on\ntrack for the longest economic expansion on record, and it’s coming in the context of very low\nunemployment and low and stable inflation. In that setting, continued steady growth is not\nwhat I’d call “disappointing.”\nThere are, of course, some risks to watch for, and I’m keeping an eye on global developments,\ngrowth abroad, and trade.\nAnother risk that’s been discussed is the yield curve, a part of which inverted last month. Again,\na primer for the uninitiated. The yield curve shows the difference between the return on bonds\nwith various lifespans — in general, shorter-term bonds tend to have lower returns while the\nlonger terms yield more. Economists refer to the premium on short-maturity Treasuries as “the\nmoney premium,” reflecting the idea that they have many of the features of money. The\n6\n\n\fnormal shorthand would be to say that they’re more liquid than long-term securities, but that\nmoney-like quality is something that investors are willing to pay for in the form of lower\nreturns.\nSo normally, there is an upward tilt to the yield curve. Long-term rates reflect expectations of\nfuture short-term rates; so if long-term rates fall below current short-term rates, it signals a\nmarket expectation that future rates will likely be lower than they are now — which happens\nwhen the economy gets weak and policymakers respond.\nTry saying that last sentence five times fast.\nWith the yield curve discussion laid out, there are some mitigating factors to consider, because\nwe’re looking at a very different economic playing field than we have in the past. The Fed’s\nbalance sheet is still historically large, which may be affecting long-term yields. And while\ninversions in the yield curve do appear to have a relationship with downturns, correlation does\nnot equal causation, and that inversion is not an absolute predictor.\nUltimately, my views are shaped by multiple indicators, and there are certainly aspects of the\neconomy — the strength of the labor market, for instance — that point to a fundamentally\nsound U.S. economy.\nAccounting for all those factors — a strong labor market, muted inflation, sustained moderate\ngrowth, and the penumbra of uncertainty — I continue to be in wait-and-see mode, and my\noutlook for rates remains, at most, one hike for 2019 and one for 2020.\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet\nI just mentioned the Fed’s balance sheet, which is yet another aspect of Fed policy and action\nthat has captured attention lately, and the last issue I’ll touch on before we head into Q&A.\nI want to start by saying that while the balance sheet is an important part of the policy\ndiscussion, it’s not indicative of our monetary policy stance.\nA final primer, this one on the balance sheet: In the wake of the global financial crisis and the\nGreat Recession, the Fed turned to what we call “unconventional” monetary policy.\n7\n\n\fOur conventional means of conducting monetary policy is the federal funds rate. Lower rates\ncan encourage economic activity while higher rates can help prevent overheating. But in 2008,\nthe economy was severely damaged, and when the Fed lowered rates to essentially zero, it still\nneeded help. We had to go beyond our usual toolkit and turned to large-scale asset purchases,\nwhich was a program better known as quantitative easing, or QE. QE involved buying assets on\na larger scale and venturing into longer-term Treasuries along with mortgage-backed securities,\nor MBS. After three rounds of QE, the balance sheet — which was roughly $900 billion before\nthe crisis — had swelled to $4.5 trillion.\nIn late 2014, we stopped the purchases, and kept the balance sheet constant by reinvesting the\nproceeds as they came to maturity. A year later, the FOMC voted for the first modest rate hike,\nsignaling the first baby steps toward normalization. After three more increases to the federal\nfunds rate, the FOMC was ready to start looking at bringing the balance sheet into the\nnormalization process, voting in September of 2017 to start the unwinding process the\nfollowing month.\nAt that point, the size of the balance sheet was larger than we’d ever seen, and the MBS in\nparticular rendered its makeup different than it was before the crisis: Assets were made up\nprimarily of those Treasuries and MBS, while the liability side overwhelmingly consisted of\npaper currency and bank reserves and balances.\nThe means of unwinding the balance sheet were straightforward: We could either stop\nreinvesting the securities as they come to maturity or sell them on the open market. We opted\nfor the former, with gradually increasing caps on the amounts that were not redeemed. This\nhelped us attain the gradual, predictable, and thoroughly boring process that we’re aiming for.\nWhich brings us to 2019. At the March FOMC meeting, we said that we intend to end the\nbalance sheet runoff in September. Once we do so, we’ll reinvest paydowns from MBS —\nsubject to a cap of $20 billion per month — into Treasuries, which reflects our long-standing\nplans to hold primarily Treasuries in our portfolio.\n\n8\n\n\fThat won’t quite be the end of normalization, however. In September, when the runoff ends,\nreserves will likely still be slightly higher than what we need to “efficiently and effectively”\nimplement monetary policy, and our ultimate goal for reserves is “no more than necessary.”\nOur plan is to keep the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for some time after\nSeptember. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease\nin average reserves, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time.\nFor me, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, which means we\nshould approach the “efficient and effective” level with caution.\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia Fed staff, 1 is not\nonly the safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the\nevolution of asset redemptions, and proceeds in the FOMC’s preferred “gradual and predictable\nmanner.”\nFinally, I want to note that balance sheet normalization has received a lot of attention both in\nour meetings and communications, and will continue to do so. Again, while that does reflect its\nimportance, it does not reflect our current monetary policy stance. We often refer to the\nFOMC’s “toolkit” when discussing policy options. Balance sheet policy certainly remains an\noption, but we’ve put it back in the toolbox, and stored it in the basement — within arm’s\nreach, but out of sight for now.\nConclusion\nThat, in the smallest nutshell possible, is the combination overview of the Fed’s purposes and\nfunctions and my economic outlook as it stands today. Instead of going on any further, I’m\ngoing to stop there to turn it over to you for questions, and again, wish the Chamber a happy\n100th birthday — you don’t look a day over 85.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n\fRevisiting the Discourse on Dynamism\nPhiladelphia Council for Business Economics\nA Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics\nPhiladelphia, PA\nApril 4, 2019\nPatrick T. Harker\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago, I was addressing the New York chapter of NABE in Midtown Manhattan. And\nit strikes me that, much like show business and politics, a year is a long time in economics, but there are,\nin fact, some strong similarities between now and then: Both components of the Fed’s dual mandate are\nin good health, my outlook is fairly positive, and I’m standing in front of a group of business economists.\nAlthough the commute was much shorter this time.\nI’ve therefore been thinking a lot about the topic I addressed at that event, which is perhaps even more\nrelevant today. Because, of course, while some aspects of the landscape have stayed the same, many\nothers have changed.\nSo with your indulgence, I’d like to revisit that subject and discuss the continued decline of business\ndynamism in the American economy. Some new research out of the Philadelphia Fed adds an interesting\ndimension, and it’s something I know business economists are thinking about right now.\nBefore I get to that, however, I’ll start with an economic outlook and preface my thoughts with the one\nthing that never changes: the standard Fed disclaimer … The views I express here today are mine alone\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLabor Market\nTurning first to employment, the labor market continues to show sustained strength. February’s jobs\nnumbers were significantly lower than both market forecasts and previous months. However, it would\nbe a mistake to allow one month’s data to obscure the robust growth and continued tightening of the\n1\n\n\fpast several years. In fact, I always caution that a single data series or report should not, on its own,\nderail an outlook; we look at that information in context, and the Fed’s mantra of “data driven” means\nthinking about how things unfold in the medium term.\nFor the past half-year, job creation has averaged 190,000 a month — showing stamina that has, frankly,\nsurprised many of us. At some point, the number of net new jobs will necessarily fall, but even then, it\nshould not be taken as a harbinger of economic doom. Somewhere around 100,000 a month will be\nmore than sufficient to keep up with growth in the labor force.\nAnother metric that’s surpassed expectations is the number of people coming off the sidelines, which is\nshowing up in the data in various ways: In the instances that the unemployment rate ticked slightly\nupward in recent months, for example, it has been reflective of more people coming into the labor\nforce.\nAll in all, I see a strong labor market, with unemployment continuing to move down, likely reaching a\nbasement in the 3½ percent range this year before ticking back up a few tenths of a percentage point.\nInflation\nAfter several years of running persistently below our preferred 2 percent target, inflation finally started\nrunning about that rate. In recent months, it’s edged back down somewhat.\nI see inflation averaging slightly higher than 2 percent this year and next, which is not out of line with\nhow I view our target. Running a little higher after such a long period of underperformance is not, in my\nmind, a red flag. The Fed has a symmetrical target, which means I’m equally concerned about\npersistently low inflation as I would be about its opposite.\nAgain, my focus is on the medium term average, and what I’m watching in particular is inflation’s\ntrajectory — that is, not just its direction, but the speed at which it travels.\nAs with all things policy related, I’ll be driven by the data. In particular, I’m giving weight to core inflation\nfor a better view of the fundamentals, as fluctuations in energy prices are likely to affect the headline\nmetric.\nGDP\nTurning to GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around 2 percent\nsome time in 2020.\n2\n\n\fThere has been a good deal of discussion in recent days and weeks of what some call “disappointing”\ngrowth projections such as my own. When advance estimates for Q1 GDP are issued in a few weeks,\nthose voices will likely be amplified: I expect Q1 of 2019 to come in around 1.5 percent. This actually\nreflects a pattern of several years’ running, in which first quarters have consistently seen low or negative\ngrowth. However, those have balanced out when the following quarters pick up steam, which is what I\nforesee for 2019. Overall, it’s important to remember that we are still looking at continued economic\ngrowth, and are on pace for the longest economic expansion in our history. That doesn’t fall into the\ncategory of “disappointing” for me.\nI also do not think the growth forecast should be entirely surprising, since it reflects well-documented\nstructural forces, rather than transitory ones. The impact of demographics, for instance, has been\ncentral to discussions of labor force participation in recent years, and that impact, in turn, has played a\npart in the continued slowing of productivity.\nOutlook and Policy Decisions\nI still see the outlook as a net positive. That said, there are some risks I’m paying close attention to. First,\nalthough household spending continues at a strong, sustained pace, businesses report increasing\nuncertainty and decreasing confidence, dampening the investment outlook somewhat. Second, global\nfactors continue to hold my attention, including growth forecasts abroad and trade developments.\nAnd, of course, there is the renewed concern about the yield curve. While it has often been the case\nthat inversions in the yield curve have preceded downturns, a couple of points bear mention,\nparticularly because they offer some assurance.\nFirst, as we all learned in econ classes, correlation does not equal causation, and while there appears to\nbe a relationship between yield curve inversions and recessions, it’s not a foolproof indicator. Second,\nthe playing field is different this time around. The Fed’s balance sheet is still historically large —\nsomething I’ll touch on in a moment — which may be influencing long-term yields.\nUltimately, my views are shaped by multiple indicators, and there are certainly aspects of the economy\n— the strength of the labor market, for instance — that point to a fundamentally sound U.S. economy.\nAccounting for all those factors — a strong labor market, muted inflation, sustained moderate growth,\nand the penumbra of uncertainty — I continue to be in wait-and-see mode, and my outlook for rates\nremains, at most, one hike for 2019 and one for 2020.\n3\n\n\fI will add here that much has been made of the FOMC’s use of “patience” in discussing the future path\nof monetary policy. I agree that patience is necessary and would, in fact, draw in other of the Seven\nVirtues: Temperance guiding a moderated and thoughtful response to accumulated data; Diligence in\nwatching and evaluating that data; and, of course, Humility, in knowing that as and when those data\nindicate, we are ready and willing to change our outlooks in accordance.\nI ask for Charity only from audiences who think I’m being long-winded …\nBefore I turn to the subject for today, I do want to visit the topic of the balance sheet, as promised. My\nopening caveat here is that, while the balance sheet is clearly part of the discussion of monetary policy,\nit is not currently indicative of our monetary policy stance.\nAs noted after the March FOMC meeting, we intend to end the balance sheet runoff in September,\nresuming the reinvestment of all principal payments. Paydowns from MBS, subject to a cap of $20 billion\nper month, will be reinvested into Treasuries, which is consistent with our long-standing plans to hold\nprimarily Treasuries in our portfolio.\nThis will not quite be the end of normalization. In September, when the runoff ends, reserves will likely\nstill be somewhat above the level needed to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy, and\nour ultimate goal for reserves is “no more than necessary.”\nWe intend to keep the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for some time after the\nSeptember end to runoffs. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual\ndecrease in average reserves, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time.\nFor me, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, which means we should\napproach the “efficient and effective” level with caution.\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia Fed staff, 1 is not only the\nsafer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of asset\nredemptions, and proceeds in the FOMC’s preferred “gradual and predictable manner.”\nSince we started unwinding in October of 2017, we stressed that the process would be entirely\nmundane — the balance sheet was put essentially on autopilot and moved to the background. Boredom\nmay not be a virtue, though we might invoke Continence in its place. And it was, in fact, entirely\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n\n4\n\n\funremarkable — and unremarked upon — until earlier this year. While there will likely be continued\ndiscussion, particularly about composition, I do believe it will — and should — be entirely excitementfree.\nIn the vernacular of the FOMC’s “toolkit” as we often refer to it: Balance sheet policy certainly remains\nan option should we need it — that is, should we again see a situation in which the federal funds rate\nalone cannot provide sufficient accommodation. But we’ve put it back in the toolbox, and stored it in\nthe basement — within arm’s reach, but out of sight for now.\nBusiness Dynamism\nThis brings me, somewhat meanderingly, to the subject I want to address.\nThe U.S. economy has historically been characterized by an elevated level of dynamism. For the\nuninitiated, the U.S. is certainly “dynamic” in the colloquial sense of being innovative and imaginative,\nbut in this case, “dynamism” refers to the economic measure that is defined by turnover: New\nbusinesses enter the market and others leave, workers move from job to job, and people come in and\nout of the workforce.\nThis perpetual churn makes resources more fluid. Labor and capital are freed to flow from the least to\nthe most productive firms, and productivity, wages, and overall economic growth increase.\nOver the past three decades or so, dynamism has been in decline. In particular, the data show lower\nbusiness start-up activity, slowing labor reallocation, and much less worker mobility. During much of\nthat time — roughly the past 20 years — there’s also been a drop in productivity growth.\nWe don’t know the strength of the relationship between these two, or, indeed, if there is one. But these\nand other economic trends raise interesting possibilities and points for consideration.\nDynamism in Decline\nTo set the stage, we can see the decline in both dynamism and entrepreneurship since the early 1980s\nin a variety of measures.\n\n5\n\n\fOn the firm side, the new start-up rate has deteriorated by close to 40 percent, while the exit rate has\nbeen more or less flat. 2 The result is a net start-up rate that has not just slowed, but has moved into\nnegative territory.\nI know this runs completely counter to intuition. For most of us, that time is inextricably linked to startup culture. That’s when companies that would eventually become giants started with a couple of people\nin a garage. That’s when the landscape of business was changed by the dot-com boom — and saw its\nsubsequent bust — then rebounded to fundamentally alter the way we communicate and generated a\nworld of tech start-ups and angel investors. But activity in start-ups reaches far wider than technology,\nand entrepreneurship is not confined to Silicon Valley. We’re also talking about mom-and-pop shops\nand local small businesses.\nThe IPO rate — a measure that has been linked to encouraging entrepreneurship and start-up activity —\nis also falling, while M&A activity has been strong, particularly over the past decade. The end result here\nis that industries are becoming increasingly concentrated, and the average listed company is bigger,\nolder, and more profitable. 3\nOn the worker side, people are now more likely to be employed at large, mature firms and are much less\nmobile than they used to be.\nThe share of employment at smaller and medium-sized younger firms has fallen from about 20 percent\nto 10 percent in the past few decades, while the proportion of workers at larger, older firms has risen\nfrom about 40 percent to 50 percent.4\nThe rate of job reallocation is falling as well — that is, the number of jobs added to and subtracted from\nthe economy. We think of this churn as a central feature of the U.S. labor market, but the reallocation\nrate has actually fallen by about 22 percent since the early ’90s.5\n\n2\n\nRyan A.

People aren’t moving for work the way they\nused to, and when they do, they don’t go as far. The rate of people moving out of state has dropped to\nless than half the average level we saw in the quarter century that followed the Second World War. 6\nThe Impact of Dynamism\nWhile the data clearly point to a decline in turnover and dynamism, there’s a logical argument that asks,\n“So what?” Isn’t it possible that this is the natural state of an economy settling into middle age? What’s\nwrong with older, bigger, more profitable firms hiring people who stay around longer?\nThe very short answer is: innovation and jobs — in the case of the latter, both the number and the\nquality.\nTaking those in turn, innovation intensity is more common in younger, smaller firms. Smaller companies\nspend more on R&D as a proportion of sales, and research shows that the quality of innovation — as\nmeasured by patent citations — is inversely proportionate to firm size. 7 Older, more staid organizations\nachieve productivity growth from entering and exiting markets, or from expanding and contracting their\nphysical presence, like offices or factories. A significant portion of industry-level growth in\nmanufacturing, for instance, is achieved this way.\nHigh productivity firms also grow faster, contributing to overall productivity growth.\nNew firms additionally provide job opportunities. That’s not to say that older firms don’t produce jobs —\ngenerally through continued growth, acquisition, and consolidation across industries. But fast-growing\nbusinesses, which tend to be young, have historically accounted for a substantial portion of job creation,\naveraging about 70 percent of gross annual job creation in the decades spanning 1992–2011. 8 And\noverall, more fluid labor markets ease the path up the job ladder, allow workers to find better matches\nfor their skills, and can encourage attachment to the labor force.\n\nTyler Cowen, “The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream,” St. Martin’s Press, New\nYork, NY (2017).\n6\n\nUfuk Akcigit, “Firm Size, Innovation Dynamics and Growth,” 2009 Meeting Papers 1267, Society for Economic\nDynamics (2009).\n7\n\n8\n\nDecker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2016).\n\n7\n\n\fThe Culprits\nThe fact that dynamism has slowed suggests that there has been some fundamental change in the\neconomy.\nOne theory is that regulatory burden is discouraging new start-ups. And while it is true that regulation\nhas generally increased in the U.S., that pace has not been constant or consistent across industries. We\ncan, therefore, compare industry dynamism with industry regulation and get a sense of whether there’s\nany correlation. The evidence so far indicates that the case is fairly weak, and where it does exist, it\nactually goes in the opposite direction. 9 The same holds true for start-up rates.\nAnother possibility is that it’s simply too expensive to start a new business. However, if the fixed cost of\nstarting a new business had risen, we would expect to see that new firms are larger, on average, than in\nthe past — but the data don’t bear that out either. 10 The inference, then, is that the amount of seed\nmoney necessary to get a new firm off the ground has not grown in any meaningful or outsized way.\nIt may be that regulation is affecting the business climate, just not in the way we usually think about it. It\nmay be — to steal a phrase from another economist — more of a “death by a thousand cuts” than a\nsingle blow of the regulatory axe, with small changes and impediments combining to create a larger\nbarrier. 11\nInhibitors of local growth, such as zoning restrictions, could be impeding the flow of workers and capital\nto high productivity areas. The cost of relocating and attempting to start a new business in places like\nSan Francisco or New York is all but prohibitive. By one estimate, lowering constraints — for instance, on\nhousing supply — in high productivity cities would significantly expand their workforces and increase\noverall GDP by almost 10 percent. 12\n\nNathan Goldschlag and Alexander Tabarrok, “Is Regulation to Blame for the Decline in American\nEntrepreneurship?” George Mason University Working Paper 15-11 (February 2015).\n\n9\n\n10\n\nJohn Haltiwanger, Ron S. Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “Who Creates Jobs? Small versus Large versus Young,”\nReview of Economics and Statistics, 95:2 (May 2013).\n11\n\nJohn Haltiwanger called it “a death by a thousand cuts.”\n\n12\n\nChang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti, “Why Do Cities Matter? Local Growth and Aggregate Growth,” Kreisman\nWorking Paper Series in Housing Law and Policy (2015).\n\n8\n\n\fImportantly, the fact that the decline in business dynamism is not confined to the United States, but is\noccurring across OECD countries, suggests that broader, systemic forces are likely playing a role. 13 The\nknock-on effects of technological advancement and demographics are almost certainly involved, as they\nplay a role in a variety of economic measures.\nA recent paper poses some interesting questions for the dynamism discussion.\nThe authors start with the groundwork: that economic activity is being concentrated in fewer firms; that\nentrepreneurship rates have been declining since the 1970s; and that there has been a decline in the\nshare of GDP going to labor since 1975. Then they note that these trends share the underlying factor of\nfirm demographics: Specifically that there is a shift in age distribution toward older firms — and older\nfirms have higher employment concentration.\nFundamentally, a decline in labor force growth means lower entry rates for new firms. But since the\n1970s, labor force growth has declined by 2 percentage points, while the entry rate of new businesses\nhas declined by 6 percentage points — meaning labor force decline alone is not enough to account for\nthe drop in start-ups.\nBut what if the decline in labor force growth also leads to changes in firm demographics, specifically in\nthe average size and aggregate exit rate? In that instance, the effect of labor force growth on start-ups\ncould be multiplied. 14 This is an active and interesting area of research that I’ll be keeping an eye on.\nFinally, there is new research by staff at the Philadelphia Fed, which looks at the effect of interest rates.\nI want to make clear from the outset that I am not talking about the federal funds rate, which the Fed\nuses to execute monetary policy — and which we often refer to, as I have done today, simply by the\nshorthand of “rates.” They’re looking at natural rates of interest, which is an independent function of\neconomic forces that is beyond the control of us mere mortals on the FOMC. We make our policy in the\ncontext set by that natural rate.\n\n13\n\nChiara Criscuolo, Peter N. Gal, and Carlo Menon, “The Dynamics of Employment Growth: New Evidence from 18\nCountries,” OECD Science, Technology and Industry Policy Papers (May 2014).\n\n14\n\nHugo Hopenhayn, Julian Neira, and Rish Singhania, “From Population Growth to Firm Demographics:\nImplications for Concentration, Entrepreneurship, and the Labor Share,” National Bureau of Economic Research\nWorking Paper 25382 (2018).\n\n9\n\n\fLooking from the late 1990s to today, their research suggests that both the decline in the start-up rate\nand the rise in business concentration may be connected to the global decline in the natural rate over\nthe same period.\nLarger firms’ cash flow is less volatile, allowing them to carry more debt against each dollar of asset.\nThat advantage can make them more willing to buy up new ideas entering the market, particularly as\nborrowing costs decline. More research is needed, and there is no direct evidence that decreased\ninterest rates have induced larger businesses to borrow with the specific intent of accumulating ideas.\nHowever, there is certainly a logical connection. If lower borrowing costs are causing more new ideas to\nbe immediately absorbed into larger firms, then a drop in the start-up rate and growing concentration of\nsales in large firms are natural consequences. 15\nIn fact, this research was sparked by a discussion we had a few years ago about the sluggishness of\nbusinesses’ real fixed investment growth in an era of record-low interest rates. We thought then that\nthe low-rate environment might be making it more profitable for large firms to grow by acquiring other\nbusinesses, rather than building new capacity. The same logic is at work here: Bigger firms can borrow\nmore cheaply than start-ups, which makes it more profitable for the bigger businesses to borrow against\nthe cash flow of a new idea and buy it from the creators.\nI should also note here that measurement adds a level of complication to the mix. Creative destruction\nat the firm level isn’t captured by dynamism statistics. Take, for example, IBM’s reinvention in the early\n1990s, after the collapse of the mainframe market. While it fundamentally remade itself into a different\ncompany, that shift wasn’t captured in the dynamism data on entry and exit. Dynamism doesn’t\nmeasure global activity very well either. In this case, Apple is the example. Apple constantly adds and\ndrops suppliers as it continues its evolution in product development; in 2013, for instance, it had about\n750 suppliers, but almost 90 percent of them were in Asia. That activity doesn’t show up in the U.S.\ndynamism statistics.\n\n15\n\nSatyajit Chatterjee and Burcu Eyigungor, “The Firm Size and Leverage Relationship and Its Implications for Entry\nand Concentration in a Low Interest World,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper 19-18 (March\n2019).\n\n10\n\n\fConclusion\nWhile we certainly have a measurement problem, it is still clear that dynamism is slowing and has been\ndoing so steadily, not just in the U.S., but across mature economies. It is also the case that a number of\nfactors are conspiring to keep it that way.\nI should note here that dynamism, much like food or wine, should be taken in moderation, and an\nexcess could lead to something of an economic hangover. The downside of dynamism, and the risk of\noverindulging in it, would be a glut of churn and all its attendant costs — frequent bankruptcies and\nbusiness failures, high rates of firings and layoffs, too much job-hopping by workers. But in an\nenvironment with the right amount, it has its intended effect: Resources are channeled to more\nproductive uses, workers are more engaged with the labor market, and innovation is nurtured.\n\n11\n\n\f"

It’s a pleasure to be in Frankfurt. Since that greeting all but exhausted my\nGerman vocabulary, I’ll turn to something I’m more fluent in: policyspeak. I promise to pepper\nit with some actual English.\nI’ll start with a brief economic outlook, then turn to a topic that has garnered a surprising\namount of attention in recent months: the Fed’s balance sheet. It is a subject rife with awkward\neconomic phrasing, but an important one nonetheless, so I hope you’ll bear with me.\nBefore we get to that, however, a bit of verbiage required of all Fed policymakers and easily\ntranslatable: the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nOutlook\nWith that out of the way, the promised outlook, which is, overall, pretty good.\nStarting with GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around\n2 percent sometime in 2020. That reflects structural, slow-moving forces — like demographics,\nmuted growth in the labor force, and lower productivity growth — rather than any temporary\nheadwind.\n1\n\n\fPCE remains the primary driver of real GDP growth, and household spending continues at a\nstrong, sustained pace. Businesses, however, have reported an increase in uncertainty and a\ndecrease in confidence. Coupled with tighter financial conditions, the investment outlook is not\nquite as rosy as last year. It’s certainly not dire, but the specter of uncertainty does cast a\nshadow, and the ambiguity of the current climate appears to be having a dampening effect.\nI am also monitoring international influences, including the outlook for growth abroad and\ntrade developments.\nFor the U.S. overall, I would say that, on balance, the potential risks tilt very slightly to the\ndownside, but I emphasize the word “slight.” I still see the outlook as positive, and the\neconomy continues to grow in what is on pace to be the longest economic expansion in our\nhistory.\nWe are also seeing continued strength in the labor market, with employment data continuing\nto show remarkable health — so much in fact, that it has surprised many of us. While there was\nwidespread despairing over the February jobs report, I’d caution against getting caught up in a\nsingle data point. The medium term is what’s important, and over the past six months, we have\ncreated an average of 190,000 jobs a month.\nInflation is running around our preferred 2 percent target and, importantly, does not appear to\nbe on a strong upward trajectory. If anything, it’s edging slightly downward.\nBased on these combined conditions, I continue to be in wait-and-see mode. My current view is\nthat, at most, one rate hike this year, and one in 2020, is appropriate, and my stance will be\nguided by data as they come in and events as they unfold.\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet — A Brief History and Where Things Stand Today\nBefore I head into the particulars of the balance sheet, I’d like to add some context, with a\nquick reminder of how we arrived here, and what, exactly, “here” is.\nIn response to the financial crisis and its aftermath, central banks around the globe took a\nnumber of policy initiatives. Unlike many others, the Federal Reserve did not enter into a\n\n2\n\n\fregime of negative rates. Instead, we lowered the federal funds rate to essentially zero, and\nfollowed it with several rounds of quantitative easing.\nAs its more technical name — large-scale asset purchases — indicates, QE involved buying large\namounts of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, swelling the Fed’s balance sheet to\napproximately $4.5 trillion — about five times its size before the onset of the crisis.\nThe last of the purchase programs ended in late 2014. At that point, the outlook for the U.S.\neconomy had improved markedly and the Committee started to think about raising the federal\nfunds rate, which was still essentially at zero. At the same time, they decided to keep the\noverall size of the balance sheet constant, reinvesting the proceedings as our asset holdings\nreached maturity.\nIn October of 2017, it was time for the balance sheet to start its journey back to normal. We\nbegan by reinvesting only some of the principal payments from our Treasury and MBS\nsecurities, and the balance sheet decreased by the amounts not reinvested. In other words, we\nlet our assets run off at a gradual and predictable pace. Steady as that pace may be, however,\nwe’ve already reduced our securities holdings by close to half a trillion dollars.\nOn the other side of the balance sheet, the aggregate level of reserves currently stands at\nroughly $1.6 trillion. That’s $1.2 trillion less than the peak of $2.8 trillion, back in 2014, and\nclose to $600 billion less than when we started unwinding. Reserves declined by more than our\nasset redemptions due to the growth of non-reserve liabilities, mostly currency.\nWe noted at the time that the unwinding would be essentially on autopilot and spectacularly\nboring — though we were clear about our intent to keep an eye on things. Along the way, we\nhave communicated our plans and principles regarding the normalization process. And from the\nvery beginning, we made it clear that we intended to hold “no more securities than necessary\nto implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”\nAs the balance sheet runoff unfolded, we rapidly approached the beginning of the end. Last\nNovember, we resumed our discussions of the Committee’s plans to implement monetary\npolicy over the longer run.\n3\n\n\fStaff from across the Federal Reserve System presented excellent work on an array of options.\nAfter careful consideration, we agreed that the current implementation framework has served\nus very well. Our administered rates have proven effective at controlling short-term interest\nrates. This allows us to continue using changes in the target range of the fed funds rate as the\nprimary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In January, therefore, we\ncommunicated our intention to maintain an “ample supply of reserves” that ensures control\nover the federal funds rate via our administered rates, without necessitating active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves.\nTransition to the Long-Run Framework\nToday, we’re in a very good place. We know what we want the long-run framework to look like;\nwe know that we’re getting closer every day; and we know that we’re not far from the efficient\nlevel of reserves. In the last meeting, therefore, we decided on one more step in the transition\nto the long-run framework.\nIn short, we intend to end the balance sheet runoff in September, resuming the reinvestment\nof all principal payments. Paydowns from MBS, capped at $20 billion per month, will be\nreinvested into Treasuries, which is consistent with our long-standing plans to hold primarily\nTreasuries in our portfolio.\nBut we are not quite done normalizing yet. We don’t just want an ample supply of reserves, we\nwant “no more than necessary.” In September, when the runoff ends, reserves will likely still be\nsomewhat above the level needed to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy.\nA key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, and we certainly don’t\nhave the luxury of a tensile test — breaking points in engineering and economics are very\ndifferent animals. We should therefore approach the “efficient and effective” level of reserves\nwith caution.\nWe intend to do that by keeping the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for a\ntime. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease in\naverage reserves, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time.\n4\n\n\fThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia 1 staff, is not only\nthe safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of\nasset redemptions. It is, therefore, firmly in line with the FOMC’s stated objective to proceed in\na “gradual and predictable manner.”\nAs reserves continue to decline, they will eventually reach their efficient and effective level,\nwhich prompts the question: Will that be the end point for normalization? Not quite. While the\nbalance sheet will indeed hold no more securities than necessary, they will likely not be the\nsecurities we want to hold in the long run.\nA Matter of Principle(s)\nAs laid out in the Normalization Plans and Principles, our aim is for the balance sheet to consist\nprimarily of Treasury securities. That is not its current composition, and won’t be for some\ntime, with MBS still accounting for 40 percent of our total asset holdings. Additionally, the\nremaining maturity of our Treasury holdings is still relatively long — about two years longer\nthan the average maturity of outstanding Treasury securities.\nThat means, of course, that we still have some normalizing to do. The conversation will\nnaturally revolve around the long-run composition the FOMC wants to achieve. However, it’s\nimportant to note that “long run” does mean “long run” — this is a marathon, not a sprint.\nEven if economic and financial conditions evolve as anticipated, the composition of the balance\nsheet will not see any drastic change in the near future. And, as noted in January, the\nCommittee is prepared to alter the size and composition of the balance sheet if future\neconomic conditions warrant more accommodative policy than can be achieved by reductions\nin the federal funds rate alone.\nIt is my own view, therefore, that the discussion should give primacy to principles over goals,\nboth in guiding the long-run composition of the portfolio and its management along the\ntransition.\n\n1\n\nI would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n\n5\n\n\fIt’s something of a crutch in speechmaking to rely on quotes from the good and the great who\ncame before us. So I ask your forgiveness as I fall into exactly that trap, and invoke an oft-cited\nline from FDR, that rules aren’t necessarily sacred, principles are.\nAmong those principles that should be granted sanctity in the debate are neutrality and\nflexibility, which had formed the basis of balance sheet management prior to the crisis.\nNeutrality should function as something of a Hippocratic Oath where market functioning is\nconcerned, vowing to “do no harm.” Our Treasury holdings should, in principle, avoid cornering\nthe market on any particular security. One option might be to simply match the maturity\ndistribution of outstanding Treasuries, which would evenly distribute our footprint across\nmaturities. We should also be mindful that recently issued Treasuries, deemed “on the run,”\nare vital for a well-functioning market. We should consider, therefore, how evenly acquisitions\nare spread at the Treasury primary auction.\nTurning to the principle of flexibility, in my view the asset portfolio should ideally allow us to\nquickly and safely deploy an array of balance sheet policies if necessary — again, this would\nonly transpire if economic conditions warranted more accommodation than the federal funds\nrate alone can provide. This is where an asset portfolio with a somewhat shorter duration offers\nan advantage: The shorter the duration of the portfolio, the larger the flow of maturing\nproceeds at any given time. That flow can be redirected, allowing for a swift change in the\ncomposition without expanding the balance sheet or having to sell assets outright. A simple\nway to ensure that the balance sheet delivers a steady flow of maturing proceeds is to increase\nTreasury holdings, which have a maturity of a year or less.\nThis approach — that is, extending the duration of our Treasury securities without expanding\nthe balance sheet — was the basis of the Maturity Extension Program, or Operation Twist, as it\nwas sometimes known, in 2011.\nWhile I believe that neutrality and flexibility should be our core guidelines, I should stress that\nthey are not the only factors to consider, and I look forward to discussions with my FOMC\ncolleagues and staff across the Federal Reserve System.\n\n6\n\n\fFinally, I want to note that balance sheet normalization has received a lot of attention both in\nour meetings and communications, and will continue to do so. While that does reflect its\nimportance, it does not reflect our current monetary policy stance. We often refer to the\nFOMC’s “toolkit” when discussing policy options. Balance sheet policy certainly remains an\noption, but we’ve put it back in the toolbox, and stored it in the basement — within arm’s\nreach, but out of sight for now.\nConclusion\nUltimately, I end where I started: Things are looking pretty good. The fundamentals of the U.S.\neconomy are strong, and we’re on the path to normal. There will be many more discussions as\nthings unfold — heavily laden with policyspeak, in all likelihood, but important nonetheless.\n\n7\n\n\f"

For\nmore than eight years, I have had the honor of working alongside many talented colleagues\nhere in Philadelphia and throughout the Federal Reserve System during an extraordinary period\nin this nation’s economic history.\nI came to Philadelphia in 2006 after more than three decades in academia, where much of my\nresearch and teaching centered on the subjects of macroeconomics, monetary theory, and\nfinance. Serving as president of the Philadelphia Fed has given me a rare opportunity to\ncombine three roles: first, to lead an extraordinary organization, as I did as dean of the Simon\nSchool of Business in Rochester; second, to serve as a monetary policymaker, and third, to\n1\n\n\fcontinue a lifelong role as an educator, through speeches like this one today, to help people\nunderstand the economy, monetary policy, and the role of the Fed.\nIt has been a fascinating yet challenging time to serve. As I look back, I had about a year to\nsettle in before facing a global financial crisis, the ensuing recession, and more than five years\nof a slow, but steady, climb back to normalcy.\nToday, I would like to take a step back from the day-to-day economic picture and give you a\npersonal appreciation of America’s decentralized, central bank, made up of 12 independently\nchartered Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. It is\ncustomary to mention that these views do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). But it won’t be long\nuntil such a caveat will no longer be necessary.\nHistorical Roots\nIt is not unusual to hear questions like, “Why are there 12 Federal Reserve Banks and do we\nreally need so many?” “Why are the 12 presidents involved in monetary policy?” “Wouldn’t\npolicy be more effective if it was delivered without the ‘cacophony’ of so many voices\nexpressing different views?” While I understand these perspectives, I think these arguments\nmiss the fundamental point driving the Federal Reserve’s governance structure.\nAmericans have a long history of suspicion toward the concentration of authority. So, our\nuniquely American form of a central bank seeks to strike a balance between centralization and\ndecentralization, between the public and private sectors, and among Washington, Wall Street,\nand Main Street. This balancing is critical to ensuring accountability and reducing the risk that\nthe institution would be captured by private or political interests.\nTo understand how it came to be, it is useful to review a little history. Just a few blocks from\nthe Philadelphia Fed stand the vestiges of our country’s two earlier attempts at a central bank,\n2\n\n\fdating back to the early years of our nation when Philadelphia was the major financial and\npolitical center of the country.\nThe first institution was the brainchild of our first Treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton. His\nefforts led to the creation of the First Bank of the United States, which was awarded a 20-year\ncharter by Congress in 1791.\nAlthough the First Bank’s charter was not renewed, the inflation and economic turmoil\nfollowing the War of 1812 convinced Congress to establish the Second Bank of the United\nStates. It was also given a 20-year charter and operated from 1816 to 1836. However, its\ncharter was not renewed — Congress could not override the veto of President Andrew Jackson,\nwho led the opposition to the central bank. Public distrust of centralized power was an\nimportant factor in the demise of both banks. Both became entangled in politics, and both\nfailed to gain the public’s confidence to serve our vast and diverse country of bakers and\nbankers, farmers and financiers, and manufacturers and merchants.\nIt took Congress nearly 80 years to try again to establish a central bank. After the severe bank\npanic in 1907, Congress began several years of study to come up with a model that would work.\nWhen Congress finally passed the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, it included a unique political\ncompromise. It established a system of semi-independent Federal Reserve Banks around the\ncountry with oversight provided by a public Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. Many in\nWashington and on Wall Street favored a more centralized central bank, either dominated by\nbankers or politicians, but Congress passed the law requiring a decentralized organization with\neight to 12 reserve banks to disperse authority. That tension between centralization and\ndecentralization has waxed and waned over the past 100 years and continues even today.\nIn the end, Congress and the Reserve Bank Organizing Committee opted for 12 Districts. Their\nsize was based on the number of banks in their Districts and their relative size in the economy.\nSince the organizers wanted the 12 Districts to begin with roughly similar capital bases, the\n3\n\n\fDistricts in the East, where more capital was concentrated, were geographically smaller than\nthe Districts in the West, where capital was more dispersed.\nCongress has debated and changed the governance structure from time to time, including the\n1927 decision to give the 12 Federal Reserve Banks permanent charters rather than 20-year\ncharters. Following the Great Depression, the passage of the Banking Acts of 1933 and 1935\nbrought about the biggest changes in governance. The Banking Act of 1935, in particular,\nrenamed the Federal Reserve Board the Board of Governors and granted the Washington-based\nentity greater powers. It specified that the Board of Governors should have seven members\nappointed by the U.S. president and confirmed by the Senate.1 Governors could serve 14-year\nterms to insulate them from short-term political pressures and to encourage a long-term\nperspective on the economy and the financial system.\nThe 12 Federal Reserve Banks, of course, were, and still are, independently chartered\ninstitutions. They each have a nine-member board of directors drawn from citizens in their\nrespective Districts to represent a cross-section of banking, commercial, and community\ninterests. Three directors represent the banking community. Six other directors, all\nnonbankers by law, come from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives. These\ndirectors not only fulfill the traditional governance role of overseeing the Bank’s performance\nbut also provide valuable insights into economic and financial conditions in the District and the\nnation. One recent change in the directors’ roles came under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010: Only the six nonbank directors on each board\nmay vote to select a Reserve Bank president, subject to the approval of the Board of Governors.\nOperational Advantages\nWhen the Fed was first established, the U.S. and much of the developed world operated on a\ngold standard. The primary objective of the new central bank was to provide an “elastic\ncurrency” so that banks could meet the cash demands of businesses and consumers. Before\n1\n\nAs of February 17, 2015, there were five Governors serving, with one more nominee awaiting Senate\nconfirmation.\n\n4\n\n\fthe Federal Reserve, circulating cash was predominately in the form of private bank notes,\nwhich could become scarce in times of panic. The Reserve Banks were given the authority to\nissue Federal Reserve Notes that were declared legal tender and so they could meet these cash\nneeds by short-term lending to banks against collateral. Thus, for the most part, the Board in\nWashington had little role to play in the primary responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Reserve Banks remain the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. It is the 12 Banks\nand not the Board of Governors that distribute currency, act as a bankers’ bank, and generally\nperform the functions of a central bank. This includes serving as the bank for the U.S. Treasury.\nIt is the Reserve Banks that have assets and a balance sheet. The earnings on these assets fund\nthe operations of the 12 Banks as well as the operations of the Board of Governors to give the\nFederal Reserve System independence from the Congressional appropriations process. In fact,\nthe System turns over any excess earnings above the cost of its operations to the U.S. Treasury.\nSo, from the beginning, the Reserve Banks have played an integral role in their regions’\neconomies. In addition to providing currency and coin services to banks, the Reserve Banks\nhandle other basic payment services, such as wire transfers and clearing checks. In fact, if you\nlook at the development of payment systems in America, many of the innovations in electronic\nfunds transfer have been led by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, including championing the\npassage of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act in 2003, which has accelerated the\nmigration from paper checks to electronic check images and electronic payments. So, rather\nthan having 45 check-processing locations at its peak, the Federal Reserve has just one location\ntoday for paper checks and one for electronic payments.\nWhile supervisory and regulatory authority for many banks and bank holding companies rests\nwith the Board of Governors by statute, not the Reserve Banks, the Board delegates authority\nto the staff in the 12 Reserve Banks to provide the boots on the ground for effective supervision\nof the covered institutions in their Districts.\n\n5\n\n\fThe Reserve Banks also act as the bank for the U.S. Treasury. They work closely with the\nTreasury to develop payment processes, such as making payments on the public debt,\ndistributing payments to Social Security recipients, and so forth.\nThe Banks also support community development activities, including research and engaging\norganizations to find effective and impactful development solutions that promote the Federal\nReserve System’s economic growth objectives in low- and moderate-income communities.\nSetting Monetary Policy\nOf course, most people think of the Federal Reserve as being responsible for setting and\nexecuting monetary policy. Here, too, the Reserve Banks play an important role. In the early\ndecades of operations, the Reserve Banks came to learn that buying and selling assets on the\nopen market had an influence on the money supply. In fact, they found that if they didn’t\ncoordinate their actions, they could encounter unintended consequences as they may act at\ncross purposes. So, in 1923, early leaders, such as Benjamin Strong in New York and George\nNorris here in Philadelphia, helped organize a committee to coordinate open market\noperations. This eventually led Congress to formally create the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, or FOMC, as the formal body within the Fed responsible for monetary policy.\nSince the Banking Act of 1935, the composition of the FOMC has included the seven Governors\nin Washington, D.C., the president of the New York Fed, and the presidents of four other\nReserve Banks, who serve one-year terms as members on a rotating basis. These rotations\nensure that all regions are represented in the formation of monetary policy. The composition\ngives the Board of Governors the majority of votes.\nHowever, whether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee’s assessment of the economy\nand policy options. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings each year to set\nmonetary policy. It discusses economic conditions and, in normal times, decides the path of\n6\n\n\fshort-term interest rates to achieve the goals of monetary policy that Congress has set for us in\nthe Federal Reserve Act.\nWhen preparing for the FOMC meetings, participants rely on their economic research\ndepartments to brief them on regional and national economic conditions and provide support\nand insight on appropriate monetary policy. The independent presidents and their research\ndepartments also help ensure that a wide variety of perspectives are brought to the table when\nwe make policy. This helps prevent monetary policy from adopting a “groupthink” mentality.\nThe separate teams of research economists in the Reserve Banks also ensure a useful diversity\nin academic pursuit. Research teams at the Banks have advanced many economic concepts\nthat have been adopted by the Federal Reserve System, such as the value of inflation targeting\nor the latest use of economic modeling. This has led to centers of excellence in the Districts,\nsuch as the Payment Cards Center and the Real-Time Data Research Center here in\nPhiladelphia.\nIn addition to economic research, the Reserve Bank presidents also gather information from\ntheir boards of directors and advisory councils and through conversations with local and\ninternational business leaders. All this helps to contribute to a rich and comprehensive mosaic\nof the national economy.\nMonetary policymaking is conducted by committee by design, and divergent views can and\noften do exist. As we worked our way through the financial crisis and through the recovery, we\nfound ourselves in uncharted territory dealing with many economic challenges. So, there is\nlittle wonder why there are often differences of opinion around the table. Some commentators\nexpress the view that dissent causes dissonance and therefore confuses the communications. I\ndisagree. I believe that open dialogue and diversity of views lead to better policy decisions and\nare the primary means by which new ideas are gradually incorporated into our monetary policy\nframework.\n7\n\n\fThus, I believe diversity of thought is a sign of a thoughtful process. I have often quoted the\nfamous American journalist Walter Lippmann, who said, “Where all men think alike, no one\nthinks very much.” I think it is healthy for the American public to know that we debate some of\nthe same issues that those outside the Fed debate. Hiding such debate behind a unanimous\nvote does nothing to promote true transparency. By being open and transparent about these\nvarious perspectives, our decentralized model for the Federal Reserve helps strengthen public\nconfidence and preserve its independence.\nDefending Central Bank Independence\nSo, why is central bank independence so important? It strikes many people as odd that in a\ndemocratic society we leave monetary policy decisions in the hands of nonelected policymakers\nwho can act with independence. I think this view stems from confusion about what is really\nmeant by central bank independence. Central bank independence means that the central bank\ncan make monetary policy decisions without fear of direct political interference. It does not\nmean — nor should it — that the central bank is not accountable for its policies.\nIt is important to remember that the Federal Reserve does not select its own goals. Instead,\nCongress sets the goals it wants the Fed to pursue with monetary policy. Since 1978, Congress\nhas mandated that the FOMC “shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit\naggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential to increase production, so as\nto promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate longterm interest rates.”\nThe goals of monetary policy are rightly a subject of legitimate debate. I have frequently\nargued that these goals are too broad, and they risk making the Fed responsible for more than\nit can actually deliver. That, from my perspective, risks undermining the Fed’s credibility and\ninvites policymakers to lurch from one goal to the next when it seems convenient, thus making\nit more susceptible to political pressure. As a consequence, I have favored a single mandate for\n8\n\n\fthe Fed — price stability — to increase the clarity of the objective and make it easier to hold the\nFed accountable.\nNevertheless, given a mandate, what central bank independence means is that Congress has\nleft the decisions of how best to achieve this mandate to Fed policymakers. Why did Congress\ndesign the Fed this way? There are two very important reasons. First, monetary policy affects\nthe economy with sometimes long and variable lags, but elected politicians, and even the\npublic, often make decisions with the next month, next quarter, or the next election in mind.\nMonetary policy actions taken today will often not have their full effect on the economy for at\nleast several quarters and perhaps as long as several years. That is why monetary policy\nchoices today must focus on the intermediate to long term and anticipate what the economy\nmight look like over the next one to three years. Indeed, the mandate itself stresses the long\nrun focus of monetary policy.\nMoreover, there can be a conflict between what monetary policy may be able to achieve over\nthe short term versus its impact over the long term. For example, in the short term, it might\nseem expedient or even desirable to try to spur economic growth and employment by\nconducting excessively accommodative monetary policy. Yet, this could lead to very bad\neconomic outcomes in the long term, including higher inflation, higher interest rates, and an\neventual tightening of policy to control inflation that may be detrimental to the economy.\nThese outcomes would be inconsistent with the long-term goals set by Congress. Delegating\nthe decision-making to an independent central bank that can help focus on long-term policy\ngoals is a way of limiting the temptation for short-term gains at the expense of the future.\nThe second important reason to give monetary policy decision-making to an independent\ncentral bank is to separate the authority of those in government responsible for making the\ndecisions to spend and tax from those responsible for printing the money. This lessens the\ntemptation for the fiscal authority to use the printing press to fund its public spending, thereby\nsubstituting a hidden tax of inflation in the future for taxes or spending cuts.\n9\n\n\fHistory is replete with examples of what happens when central banks are not independent or\nbecome agents for a nation’s fiscal policy. Just think of the hyperinflation in Germany between\nthe World Wars of the last century, or in Italy before the euro, or in the numerous financial\ncrises and high inflation rates in Latin American in more recent years, to name just a few. The\nconsequences — higher inflation, currency crises, and economic instability — are not good.\nThis is why so many countries have structured their central banks with a great deal of\nindependence from political interference.\nDespite the strong arguments for political independence, there continue to be proposals that\nwould make monetary policy subject to more political interference. In recent years, this effort\nhas manifested itself in the movement in Congress to pass an “Audit the Fed” bill. Since 1978,\nCongress has specifically exempted monetary policy decisions from such “audits” by the\nGovernment Accountability Office, or GAO, with good reason. The bill is not really about an\naudit in the usual accounting or financial sense of the term, since the Fed’s financial statements\nand indeed its operations in supervision and payment services are already subject to extensive\noutside audits by the GAO, the Board of Governors’ Office of the Inspector General, and an\noutside public accounting firm. Rather, this proposal to strike that exemption for monetary\npolicy is an attempt to reduce the independence of the central bank through the threat of a\npolitical action in real time.\nFor example, under the provisions of the bill, the GAO could be called on to investigate a\nmonetary policy decision whenever any member of Congress opposes a decision to change\ninterest rates. This possibility would change the dynamics of the FOMC’s internal discussions\nand undermine the Fed’s credibility and its ability to conduct monetary policy in the long-term\ninterests of the American public.\nOver the past 30 years, many countries have acted to increase the degree of independence of\nmonetary policymaking from short-term political influences. In a democracy, though,\n10\n\n\findependence must be accompanied by accountability. In recent years, the Fed has increased\nits transparency. The FOMC issues a statement after every meeting. It publishes the minutes\nthree weeks after each meeting. It also reports the economic projections of Committee\nparticipants four times a year. These meetings are followed by press conferences with the chair\nof the FOMC. In 2012, the FOMC issued a statement clarifying our longer-run goals and\nstrategy, including an explicit 2 percent target for inflation. And the economic projections now\ninclude information about the policy path assumptions of participants. Finally, after five years,\nverbatim transcripts are available for every FOMC meeting.\nThe Reserve Banks’ structure also helps increase transparency by communicating economic and\nmonetary policy objectives and actions through educational outreach and speeches such as this\none, as well as discussions with their boards of directors and other groups.\nI support these ongoing efforts to increase accountability and transparency, but I do not\nsupport efforts that would lead to greater political interference in monetary policy decisions.\nSuch efforts include the audit-the-Fed movement but also those efforts that would make\nReserve Bank presidents political appointees.\nI do not believe the Fed is perfect or that it is infallible. As you know, I have been a vocal critic\nat times. But I have also been explicit over the years about steps that could be taken to\nstrengthen the Fed as an institution. I have argued for a narrow mandate that is achievable so\nthe Fed can be held accountable. I have stressed the importance of transparency and a\nsystematic approach to policy that reduces uncertainty and makes policy more predictable.\nThese could be helpful in strengthening credibility and the public’s trust in the institution. But\nsteps that undermine the Fed’s independence or make it more susceptible to political control\nand influence in the short run are counterproductive.\nI also believe that a key strength of the institution is the vibrant role the 12 independent\nReserve Banks play in operations and policymaking. They are a safeguard, not a straightjacket.\n11\n\n\fToo much power or authority concentrated in Washington or Wall Street could make the\ncentral bank more susceptible to capture by political or private interests.\nConclusion\nSo, I believe the Federal Reserve System, with 12 Reserve Banks and a central Board of\nGovernors has withstood the test of time, in part because it has checks and balances to protect\nand serve our diverse nation. Americans have a long history of suspicion toward the\nconcentration of authority. So, Congress has created a uniquely American form of a central\nbank to find a middle ground between centralization and decentralization, between the public\nand private sectors, and among Washington, Wall Street, and Main Street.\nMy time as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has deepened my\nappreciation of our nation’s decentralized central bank. I have great respect for the institution\nand the people who serve here in Philadelphia and around the Federal Reserve System.\nI hope that you — and our nation more broadly — come to appreciate the unique role of the 12\nFederal Reserve Banks as integral parts of our nation’s central bank. Thank you.\n\n12\n\n\f"

I am delighted to speak\nwith so many of Philadelphia’s business leaders this morning. A couple of years ago,\nRichard served on the Philadelphia Fed’s advisory council of community bankers and as\nour District’s representative to a similar council at the national level. So, he knows\nfirsthand about the intricacies of the Fed’s structure as America’s decentralized, central\nbank, with 12 independently chartered Federal Reserve Banks, overseen by the Board of\nGovernors in Washington, D.C.\nIt is a model that has worked for a century, bringing together a rich mosaic of\nperspectives as we discuss policy. Yet, it requires that I remind the audience that the\n\n1\n\n\fviews I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nI will begin with a brief overview of the economy. Yet, because you have already heard\nseveral views of the year ahead — including the report of your membership survey — I\nplan to spend most of my time giving you a longer-term perspective on what I think is a\nsound approach to monetary policy.\nEconomic Overview\nWe began 2014 with a severe winter, which led to a first-quarter decline in GDP of 2.1\npercent. After that bleak start, though, we saw robust GDP growth in the second and\nthird quarters of 4.6 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively. The third-quarter estimate\nwas the strongest quarterly growth in more than a decade. More important, four of the\npast five quarters have seen growth rates of 3.5 percent or more, with only the wintry\nfirst quarter as the exception. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters\nestimated that fourth-quarter growth would moderate to 2.7 percent. Some recent\ntracking estimates are now placing it over 3 percent. We won’t know what the official\nfirst estimate will be until the end of this month, but even that slight slowdown would\nlead to full-year growth in 2014 that is a bit higher than many had expected.\nLooking forward, I believe we will see growth averaging about 3 percent in 2015 before\nedging down to a long-term trend growth rate of about 2.4 percent.\nRecent data also show a stronger contribution from consumer spending, which accounts\nfor more than two-thirds of the GDP. Significant improvement in household balance\nsheets and a stronger employment picture have helped support a more confident\nconsumer. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) have grown at a 4.5 percent\nannual pace over the past three months.\n\n2\n\n\fManufacturing also continues to show strength. Recent figures from the Philadelphia\nFed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, the national ISM manufacturing index,\nand industrial production all indicate that the manufacturing sector is expanding at a\nhealthy pace.\nStrong consumer and business spending has supported consistent gains in the labor\nmarket. Nonfarm employment expanded by 252,000 jobs in December, giving us 11\nconsecutive months of 200,000-plus job growth. For the full year, we had average\nmonthly gains of 246,000 in 2014, compared with 194,000 in 2013. In fact, we added\nnearly 3 million jobs in 2014, the most in a calendar year since 1999. Those job gains\nhave led to a steady decline in the unemployment rate, which is now 5.6 percent, down\nmore than a point from a year ago. Even the broader measure of unemployment,\nreferred to as U-6, which includes marginally attached workers and those working part\ntime for economic reasons, has fallen to 11.2 percent.\nInflation is running at about 1.5 percent, which is below the Fed’s long-term target of 2\npercent, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for PCE. Yet, I and\nmany other economists anticipate that inflation will gradually move toward the target\nas the transitory effects of lower oil prices fade.\nIn summary, I believe the economy has returned to a more normal footing, and as such,\nI believe that monetary policy should follow suit. In doing so, I believe we should\nstrengthen our commitment to four fundamental principles of sound central banking.\nDuring the past eight years, I have spoken and written frequently about ways to\nimprove the framework we use for making monetary policy decisions. In my view, the\nmonetary policy framework is most effective when the central bank:\n•\n\ncommits to a set of clearly articulated objectives that can be feasibly\nachieved by monetary policy;\n\n•\n\nconducts monetary policy in a systematic, rule-like manner;\n3\n\n\f•\n\ncommunicates its policies and actions to the public in a clear and transparent\nway; and\n\n•\n\nprotects its independence by being transparent and credible in pursuit of its\ngoals.\n\nClearly Articulating Objectives\nLet’s consider these four principles, beginning with clearly articulating the objectives of\nmonetary policy. Congress set our monetary policy goals in the Federal Reserve Act,\nwhich specifies that the Fed “shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit\naggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential to increase\nproduction, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable\nprices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since moderate long-term interest\nrates generally result when prices are stable, many have interpreted these goals as a\ndual mandate to manage fluctuations in employment in the short run while preserving\nprice stability in the long run.\nIn my view, this dual mandate has contributed to a view that monetary policy can\naccomplish far more than perhaps it is capable of achieving. I believe that assigning\nmultiple objectives for the central bank has opened the door to highly discretionary\npolicies, which can be justified by shifting the focus or rationale for action from goal to\ngoal. That is why I have argued that Congress ought to redefine the Fed’s monetary\npolicy goals to focus solely, or at least primarily, on price stability. I base this on two\nfacts: Monetary policy has a very limited ability to influence real variables, such as\nemployment. Even the FOMC’s own statement of longer-run goals adopted in 2012\nnotes that the maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary\nfactors, such as changing demographics and changing tax and regulatory policies that\ninfluence the labor market. Conversely, in a regime with fiat currency, only the central\nbank can ensure price stability. Indeed, it is the one goal that the central bank can\nachieve over the longer run.\n4\n\n\fSetting clear, achievable objectives is the first part of the framework. Asking\npolicymakers to pursue those objectives in a systematic, rule-like approach is the second\nkey principle.\nThe Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy\nSo, what do I mean by a systematic approach to policy? Quite simply, I mean\nconducting policy in a more rule-like manner. You often hear Fed officials say that\npolicy decisions are “data dependent” and, indeed, they are. This means that future\npolicy actions are conditional on how the economic data unfold. We may not know\nwhat the future holds or what future policy decisions will be, but we can choose to\nmake those decisions in a systematic way based on the incoming economic data. I have\nlong advocated this approach to “rule-like” policymaking. 1\nOf course, the alternative to rule-like policy is discretionary policy, in which\npolicymakers are free to choose whatever action seems appropriate or convenient at\nthe time. Rules act as restrictions on policymakers’ choices — limiting the degree of\ndiscretion. But this is not a bad thing; rather, it can result in better economic outcomes\nin the long run. This is accomplished in part by reducing the risk of very bad\ndiscretionary decisions, such as those that occurred in the 1970s. Moreover, for more\nthan 30 years, we have known that a credible commitment by policymakers to behave\nin a systematic rule-like manner leads to better outcomes than discretion by reducing\npolicy uncertainty. 2\nMore specifically, rules work better than discretion because they are transparent and\ntherefore allow for simpler and more effective communication of policy decisions.\n1\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “The Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy,” speech given to the National\nAssociation for Business Economics, Washington Economic Policy Conference, Washington, D.C. (March 3,\n2008).\n2\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal\nPlans,” Journal of Political Economy, 85 (June 1977), pp. 473–491.\n\n5\n\n\fThis allows households and businesses to more accurately form expectations and thus\nmake better decisions. As a result, systematic policy promotes a more stable,\npredictable, and efficient economy.\nI want to emphasize that monetary policy should be data dependent, not date\ndependent. In my last vote as a member of the FOMC in December, I dissented, in part\nbecause I believe the language of the statement was still trying to communicate policy\nin terms of time. Whether the Committee states that it will be “patient” or that it will\nwait a “considerable time,” the language continues to stress the passage of time as a\nkey determinant of policy, rather than making clear that policy will depend on the data.\nDescribing policy in terms of time could also risk limiting the Committee’s flexibility to\nrespond to the data if we continue to see an improving economy.\nInstead, I believe we should describe how we will respond to the data; that is, we should\ndescribe a reaction function. I frequently consider such reaction functions as I think\nabout policy. These are typically Taylor-like rules, named for Stanford University\neconomist John Taylor who first proposed them in the early 1990s. These policy rules\ntypically call for the targeted funds rate to respond to deviations of inflation from some\ndesired goal and to deviations of output from some measure of potential — sometimes\nreferred to as economic “slack” or the “gap.” Sometimes such gaps are translated into\ndeviations from full employment.\nSuch robust rules recognize that data are measured imprecisely and are subject to\nrevision. Moreover, they have been shown to perform well in a variety of models and\nconditions. I believe these robust rules can be useful guideposts for policymakers and\nthe public in assessing the stance of monetary policy and its expected path.\nCommunicating about such guideposts would enhance transparency and help make\npolicy more systematic.\n\n6\n\n\fHowever, I don’t believe that we need to follow rules mechanically. Judgment will\nalways be required. Yet, policymakers and the public should be very cautious when they\ncall for policy rates to deviate in significant ways from these guideposts. Making such\njudgments should require careful analysis, and the justification for deviating from the\nguidelines should be clearly communicated to the markets and to the public. Thus,\npolicymakers will still be able to exercise discretion, but using rules as guideposts will\nenhance transparency and effective communication.\nImproving Transparency\nThis leads me to my third important principle for monetary policy — communicating in a\nclear and transparent way. In recent speeches, I have proposed that the FOMC could\nimprove communication and transparency by publishing a more comprehensive\nmonetary policy report on a regular basis, perhaps quarterly.3\nThis report could incorporate a discussion of such robust systematic rules I referred to a\nmoment ago in its description of the underlying policy framework. The rules could serve\nas a benchmark for the current stance of policy and the expected path of policy, based\non economic data.\nAt the end of December, the Philadelphia Fed issued an example of what such a\ndiscussion might look like in a monetary policy report. We used a set of policy rules to\nbenchmark the current stance and path of policy and discussed the implications.4\nThe report showed that the federal funds rate is no longer constrained by the zero\nlower bound under a number of these rules. In fact, the rules indicate that maintaining\n3\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Systematic Monetary Policy and Communication,” remarks to the Economic Club\nof New York, New York, NY, June 24, 2014; and Charles I. Plosser, “Monetary Rules: Theory and Practice,”\nremarks to the Hoover Institution, Stanford, CA, May 30, 2014.\n4\nSee http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/publications/special-reports/2014/1231-usingrules-for-benchmarking.pdf.\n\n7\n\n\fthe federal funds rate at the zero lower bound is unusually accommodative by historical\nstandards. The benchmarks suggest that as the economy transitions to full employment\nand moves closer to its long-run inflation target, we should begin to gradually reduce\naccommodation by raising the funds rate target. Delaying liftoff runs the risk of\nrequiring more aggressive future monetary policy than would otherwise be needed.\nHowever, if the Committee felt it was desirable to further delay the initiation of interest\nrate increases, such a report would provide the opportunity, indeed the obligation, for a\nthorough and thoughtful discussion about why discretionary deviations from the\nguideposts were appropriate.\nThus, publishing a monetary policy report with an assessment of the likely near-term\npath of policy rates, in conjunction with its economic forecast, would be a useful\nexercise and enhance communications. It would also provide added discipline for\npolicymakers to stick to a systematic, rule-like approach. And it would force\npolicymakers to think more deeply and systematically about policy and the justification\nfor significant deviations from the guideposts.\nPreserving Independence\nI believe such communication would ultimately strengthen the independence of the\ncentral bank, which is the fourth and final principle of sound central banking. Central\nbank independence leads to better economic outcomes. But in a democratic society,\nindependence must be accompanied by accountability.\nTransparent and clear communication of monetary policy goals and a decision-making\nframework help ensure accountability and preserve central bank independence.\nTransparency can also enhance a central bank’s credibility. A central bank that is\ntransparent will be less willing to make promises it cannot keep. And accountability is\nmore easily achieved when there is transparency. The public can best hold a central\n8\n\n\fbank accountable when its goals are clearly stated and achievable. Broad, ill-defined\ngoals, on the other hand, reduce accountability and invite discretionary policies that can\nundermine the public trust and thus jeopardize independence. This is one reason why I\nhave been concerned about credit allocation initiatives by the Fed that treated some\ncreditors more favorably than others in bailouts and that sought to provide special\nsupport to the housing sector through its purchases of mortgage-backed securities.\nSuch credit allocation decisions more appropriately rest with the fiscal authorities, not\nthe central bank. By pushing these boundaries, the Fed puts its independence at risk.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the U.S. economy continues to improve. Although we have not witnessed\nthe strong bounce back from the depths of the recession that some anticipated, the\nrecovery has been remarkably steady.\nLabor markets continue to heal, and their stronger-than-expected recovery should serve\nto underpin continued economic expansion. Consumer balance sheets are much\nimproved, and households have regained much of the wealth they lost during the crisis.\nThat gives me additional confidence that the economy is now operating normally and so\nshould monetary policy.\nAs we normalize policy, I believe we should follow four principles. The Fed should\nensure that it has clearly articulated objectives that can be achieved by monetary policy,\nwith price stability as the primary objective. It should pursue its objectives in a\nsystematic, rule-like manner and help the public understand how policy will react\nsystematically to changes in economic conditions.\nI believe a detailed monetary policy report could be a useful vehicle for such enhanced\ncommunication of policy, which will improve the transparency and predictability of\nmonetary policy, which ultimately reduces policy surprises. Businesses and consumers\n9\n\n\fare more informed about the course of monetary policy because they understand how\npolicymakers are likely to react to changing economic circumstances, even if they are\nnot certain what those economic conditions might be.\nEqually important in my view is that greater clarity about policymakers’ reaction\nfunction strengthens accountability. So, systematic policy, communicated\ntransparently, strengthens accountability and credibility and, thus, serves to preserve\nthe central bank’s independence.\n\n10\n\n\f"

The Charlotte Economics Club has\nwelcomed many leading Federal Reserve voices to this podium over the years, including\na number of my fellow Fed presidents. You have heard from President Jeff Lacker of the\nRichmond Fed, which has its Charlotte Branch over on East Trade Street, as well as\nPresidents Richard Fisher of Dallas and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta. So I am pleased to\nhave been included among your distinguished guests.\nOn November 16, the Federal Reserve observed the 100th anniversary of the opening of\nall 12 Federal Reserve Banks around the country on the same day. These institutions\nalong with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., comprise our nation’s\ndecentralized central bank. This decentralized structure is one of the System’s great\n1\n\n\fstrengths. Not only does it promote a diversity of views, but it also helps to build public\ntrust and preserve independence. However, it requires that I begin by reminding you\nthat the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nYour program chair, Professor Rob Roy McGregor, has spent a great deal of his academic\ncareer studying the workings of the FOMC — including the use of power by the Chair\nand the nature of consensus building and dissent within the Committee. Interestingly,\nsome of this work has been coauthored with a former colleague of mine at the\nPhiladelphia Fed, Todd Vermilyea, who now works at the Board of Governors.\nToday, I plan to talk about the importance of taking a longer-term view in setting\nmonetary policy. We live in a 24-hour news cycle that focuses a lot of time and energy\non analyzing the tea leaves from the daily onslaught of new economic data at our\ndisposal. Yet, I believe it is a mistake for policymakers to focus too intently on the most\nrecent numbers to justify a policy decision. Our data are always noisy and often subject\nto substantial revision, as we just witnessed with last week’s GDP revisions and as we\nsee regularly with the monthly employment report. Instead, we must focus our\nattention on the underlying trends and the likely path of the economy over the\nintermediate to longer-term horizon.\nOne reason why policymakers must think long term is that the effects of monetary\npolicy actions on inflation and employment may not be felt for many quarters and\nmaybe years in the future. Thus, the near term path of the economy is unlikely to be\naltered in any significant way by today’s policy choices. We must look further ahead in\nassessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy. Of course, there is a great deal of\nuncertainty about the future and that too has implications for how we should approach\npolicy.\n2\n\n\fI will begin with a brief overview of the economy as one policymaker sees it as we near\nthe end of 2014.\nEconomic Conditions\nOver the past year, we have seen encouraging signs in the economy. The most recent\nestimate of annualized real GDP growth in the third quarter was 3.9 percent, which\nfollowed strong growth in the second quarter of 4.6 percent. Taking a longer view,\ngrowth from the third quarter of last year to this year was 2.4 percent. But this includes\na negative 2.1 percent growth rate in the first quarter of 2014 that was a consequence\nof a severe winter and was largely transitory in nature. We are seeing continued\nstrength in personal consumption, especially in durable goods, as well as business fixed\ninvestment, which marked the strongest two quarter growth in investment by\nbusinesses in nearly three years.\nGDP growth has averaged 2.3 percent over the 21 quarters of the recovery since mid2009. That is a half point below the 5-year growth rates measured during most of the\n2000s before the recession, which is, in part, why this recovery is often seen as being\nmoderate or modest from an historical perspective.\nNonetheless, we have seen a sustained improvement in the manufacturing sector. The\nNovember reading from the Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey\nindicated very strong growth in manufacturing activity. Even more encouraging are the\nsustained increases we have witnessed in this sector. After a mediocre performance\nfrom mid-2011 to mid-2013, the index has now been positive for nearly 18 consecutive\nmonths, with the only aberration in February 2014 during the depths of our severe\nwinter weather. Our index is often viewed as a useful indicator of national\nmanufacturing activity, and indeed the national ISM manufacturing index has also\nshown solid performance over the past 18 months.\n3\n\n\fThe labor market has also strengthened over the year. Employers added jobs at an\naverage rate of 229,000 per month in the first 10 months of the year, which is 18\npercent higher than the rate in 2013, and it’s the highest we have seen at any point in\nthe recovery. This acceleration in job growth has helped bring the unemployment rate\ndown to 5.8 percent as of October, compared with 7.2 percent a year ago.\nOver the course of this recovery, the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10\npercent in October 2009 to 5.8 percent today. Other measures of unemployment have\nalso declined. For example, the measure called U6, which includes marginally attached\nworkers and those working part time for economic reasons, has fallen from its peak of\n17.2 percent to 11.5 percent.\nInflation, for the moment, remains well contained. The personal consumption\nexpenditures, or PCE, price index, the measure of inflation preferred by the FOMC,\nregistered a 1.4 percent increase over the 12 months through October. It is running\nsomewhat below the FOMC’s stated longer-term target of 2 percent, but it remains\nabove the level that should stoke concerns of sustained deflation.\nFalling energy prices are generally good news for consumers and a favorable\ndevelopment for the economy going forward. In the short term, the decline in the\nrelative price of energy will show up in lower headline inflation, but as energy prices\nstabilize, headline inflation will increase. Policymakers tend to look through such\nvolatile and transitory price changes to assess the underlying trend in inflation. The\ncore PCE index, which excludes food and energy, is a bit higher than the overall\nmeasure, increasing 1.6 percent over the 12 months through October. Other measures\nof inflation, including those that attempt to reduce the weight given to large outliers in\nany given month, all tend to suggest that inflation is running between 1.5 percent and 2\npercent. Given the precision with which we can measure such things, I find this\n4\n\n\foutcome satisfactory. Nevertheless, I anticipate that the FOMC will conduct policy over\ntime in such a manner that inflation will gradually move toward the Fed’s 2 percent\ntarget. Private sector forecasters seem to share this view as the Philadelphia Fed’s most\nrecent Survey of Professional Forecasters shows that long-term inflation expectations\nremain stable at 2 percent.\nMonetary Policy\nIn my discussion of the economy, I have emphasized the longer-run path of the recovery\nrather than the month-to-month fluctuations. Viewed in this context, it is clear that the\neconomy has come a long way since the recovery began in June 2009. To me, that\nmeans we should no longer be conducting monetary policy as if we were still in the\nmidst of a financial crisis or in the depths of a recession.\nThe financial crisis was an extraordinary event, and much of the commentary on\nmonetary policy has focused on the actions of central banks in response to the financial\ncrisis. That is appropriate and understandable. Yet, there is another lesson to be\nlearned from the past six years that I think is important to recognize. And that is how\ndifficult it is for monetary policy to fine-tune real growth in the economy. Despite the\nFOMC’s stated desire and aggressive actions to accelerate the pace of the recovery,\ngrowth has proceeded at a moderate pace since the end of the crisis. Monetary policy\nhas simply not proved to be the panacea that many had hoped. As I have argued on a\nnumber of occasions, I believe we have come to expect too much from monetary policy.\nWe would be better served by greater humility and lowered expectations of the\npotential for monetary policy to manage real economic growth and employment.\nTen years ago, I suspect most commentators would have told you that six years of a\nnear-zero federal funds rate target and more than $3.5 trillion of long-term asset\npurchases by the Fed would likely produce an economic boom in the near term and\nwould risk inflation in the longer term. Well, although we have experienced modest\n5\n\n\fgrowth, we have not experienced a boom, and the jury remains out as to whether\ninflation will materialize as a consequence. Some argue that the absence of the boom is\nbecause the Fed didn’t do enough — more was needed to offset the constraint of the\nzero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Of course, there is an alternative\nhypothesis: Monetary policy was not capable of offsetting or mitigating the sorts of real\nchallenges the economy was facing. Distinguishing between these two hypotheses will\nundoubtedly be the subject of intense research in the coming decades. After all,\neconomists are still studying the policy choices and their effects during the Great\nDepression eight decades ago.\nBut let me turn our attention to how monetary policy should evolve going forward. I\nbegan my remarks by noting that monetary policy should focus on the intermediate to\nlonger term and be less sensitive or reactive to short-run and transitory movements in\nthe data. To that end, I see the economy continuing to improve with real growth\naveraging about 3 percent in 2015 before coming back down to its long-term trend\ngrowth rate of about 2.4 percent. Employment will continue to expand, and inflation\nwill move closer to our 2 percent target. While people can disagree about the extent to\nwhich the labor market has healed, it is clear that the labor market is in much better\nshape than it was in 2009 when unemployment reached its peak of 10 percent. The\neconomy has come a long way, and monetary policy should reflect such progress.\nThis progress suggests that monetary policy should begin to normalize. Keeping the\nfunds rate target near zero when inflation is close to our goal and the economy is near\nfull employment is both unprecedented and risky in my view. Waiting too long to begin\nthe process of raising the policy rate risks facing the possibility that the rate may have to\nincrease rapidly when the time comes and that could prove unnecessarily disruptive.\nAnd waiting could also risk a more rapid pickup in inflation.\nOf course, policymakers face many uncertainties, and so they must be prepared to\n6\n\n\fadjust policy as the underlying trends in inflation and the real economy evolve. So, how\nshould a central bank best inform the public about those uncertainties and the\nprospective path of policy?\nThe appropriate way to communicate the future of policy is to describe in a general way\na reaction function. That is to describe what key economic variables influence the\nsetting of policy and to give a sense of how policy will change in response to changes in\nthose variables. Over the past several years, I have criticized policy messages that\nsuggest that calendar time is a relevant metric for determining a policy action. We must\navoid such date-based forward guidance, whether it uses specific calendar dates or\nmore vague references alluding to a “considerable period” of time. As policymakers, we\ndo not know what the future holds, so forward guidance in this form cannot be very\ncredible.\nUnfortunately, it is unlikely that policymakers will adopt a specific reaction function in\nthe near term. Yet, there are numerous examples of such systematic approaches or\nreaction functions that can help us to gauge the stance of policy. Some of these\nreaction functions have been shown to be robust in a variety of circumstances and\nuseful in describing past monetary policy behaviors. They can, I believe, provide useful\nguidelines for assessing the stance and the likely path of monetary policy. They can also\nbe useful in communicating policy to the public. I frequently consider such reaction\nfunctions as I think about policy. These are typically Taylor-like rules named for the\nStanford University economist John Taylor who first proposed them in the early 1990s.\nThese policy rules typically call for the targeted funds rate to respond to deviations of\ninflation from some desired target and to deviations of output from some measure of\npotential — sometimes referred to as economic “slack” or the “gap.” Sometimes such\ngaps are translated into deviations from full employment.\nThese policy rules can offer useful guideposts for policymakers and the public in\n7\n\n\fassessing the stance of monetary policy, and communicating more about such\nguideposts would enhance transparency and help make policy more systematic. Thus,\nthere is no need to mechanically follow any particular rule, and judgment will always be\nrequired. Yet, policymakers and the public should be very cautious when they call for\npolicy rates to deviate in important or significant ways from these guideposts. Making\nsuch judgments should require careful analysis, and the justification for deviating from\nsuch guidelines should be clearly communicated to the markets and to the public.\nA monetary policy strategy such as I have just described could be communicated\nthrough a regular Monetary Policy Report, perhaps published quarterly. The report\nwould offer an opportunity to reinforce the underlying policy framework of the\nCommittee and how it relates to current and expected economic conditions.\nPublishing a Monetary Policy Report with an assessment of the likely near-term path of\npolicy rates, in conjunction with its economic forecast, would also provide added\ndiscipline for policymakers to stick to a systematic, rule-like approach. Communication\nabout that path, in turn, gives the public a much deeper understanding of the analytical\napproach that guides monetary policy, thus making policy more transparent and\npredictable.\nIn the current environment, an assessment of a variety of these robust rules suggests\nthat the funds rate target is no longer constrained by the zero lower bound. These rules\nindicate that liftoff of the funds rate target from zero should have already occurred or\nshould occur in the very near future. It is important to point out that all of these rules\nrecognize and take into account the fact that the inflation rate remains somewhat\nbelow the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. Nevertheless, they do not call for maintaining\nthe funds rate target near zero.\nThese rules are helpful because they not only suggest when liftoff should occur, but they\n8\n\n\foffer guidance about the future path of rate changes, given the likely direction of the\neconomy — that is, forecasts of inflation and employment “gaps.” Even more important\nis that if the forecasts of the future change, these guideposts can highlight how the\nentire policy path is likely to evolve. As such, they are capable of better aligning the\npublic’s expectations of policy with those of the FOMC, making the conduct of monetary\npolicy more accountable and more efficient.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the U.S. economy continues to recover at a moderate pace. Although we\nhave not witnessed the strong bounce back from the depths of the recession that some\nanticipated, the recovery has been somewhat remarkable in the steadiness with which it\nhas progressed. Labor markets continue to heal, and their stronger-than-expected\nrecovery should serve to underpin continued economic expansion. Consumer balance\nsheets are much improved, and individuals have regained significant fractions of the\nwealth they lost during the crisis. That gives me additional confidence that the economy\nis now operating fairly normally and that policy should reflect that normalization.\nPolicy can also be made more transparent and effective by specifying more completely\nthe variables that guide policy and the general way that one can expect policymakers to\nreact to those variables. To this end, I believe the FOMC should move forward to\ndescribe in a qualitative way its reaction function and then communicate our actions\nand decisions in terms of this reaction function. A detailed Monetary Policy Report\ncould be a useful vehicle for such enhanced communication by discussing a range of\nrobust policy rules. Placing policy choices in such a context will lead to a more\nsystematic approach to policy and one that is more transparent and predictable.\n\n9\n\n\f"

I also am delighted to be here with my\nfellow panelists, Frank Schorfheide of the University of Pennsylvania, who is a regular visiting\nscholar at the Philadelphia Fed, Neal Soss of Credit Suisse, and, of course, our moderator,\nBinyamin Appelbaum of the New York Times. As usual, I should remind everyone that my\nremarks today are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or\nmy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe question of whether we are facing the prospect of some sort of new economic normal or\nsteady state growth path is a challenging one. Some have pondered whether the severity of\nthe financial crisis and recession, or perhaps even the policy responses to these events, have\nushered in a period of low growth and reduced productivity that may persist for some time.\n\n1\n\n\fOthers have suggested the seeds of a secular decline in growth predate the recession. This\nview stresses an evolving secular decline arising from a weakening in the rate of innovation and\nthe productivity gains that such innovation often fosters. This view also points to demographic\nfactors, such as an aging population, that will strain government programs that transfer\nresources from workers to the elderly.\nThe evolution of longer-run growth also has implications for the longer-term real interest rate,\nwhich is largely determined by the growth in per capita consumption and the growth rate in\npopulation. In turn, the growth in per capita consumption depends on productivity gains and\nthe share of the population engaged in production. The implications of these factors on the\nreal interest rate is, of course, relevant for central bankers as they seek to set a policy rate to\nstabilize prices and promote sustainable growth. Yet, it is important to note that monetary\npolicy is not capable of reversing or mitigating such secular slowdowns. Consequently, it is at\nbest tangential to the efforts of a nation seeking to address secular declines in growth.\nIn my brief time, I will highlight some of the issues underlying the views of a secular slowdown.\nThat said, however, I want to emphasize that it is very hard to determine with any precision the\nlonger-term growth rate of the economy. It often takes many years of data to establish any\ndegree of confidence in asserting a change in a trend. As a result, it should come as no surprise\nthat I do not have an answer for the question whether we are facing a new normal. Instead, I\nwill offer observations on what I believe are some of the key issues that make such assessments\nso challenging.\nLong-Run Trends\nLet me start with the question of future productivity growth, since it is the most fundamental\ndeterminant of economic prosperity. Recently, Robert Gordon has advanced the notion that\nwe are in for a bout of long-term secular stagnation. 1 His writings reflect the idea, also\n1\n\nSee Gordon, “Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds” and “The Demise\nof U.S. Economic Growth: Restatement, Rebuttal, and Reflections.”\n\n2\n\n\fproposed by Tyler Cowen, that all the low-hanging fruit has been picked and that technological\nadvances will become increasingly more difficult.2 On the other hand, scholars such as Joel\nMokyr, Erik Brynjolfsson, and Andrew McAfee do not see any reason to anticipate a long-lasting\ndecline in human ingenuity.\nGordon has produced some provocative research concerning the demise of economic growth in\nthis country. He describes a number of headwinds, four of which are relevant for my\ndiscussion: slowing innovation, reduced growth in human capital due to a dysfunctional\neducation system, slower population growth, and the associated changing age distribution.\nThese four components are important because economic growth and the natural level of the\nreal interest are directly affected by growth in total factor productivity. Further, slower growth\nin population or declines in participation rates due to aging, other things being equal, can\nreduce the natural or long-run real rate of interest and lower per-capita economic growth.\nGordon’s view of stagnation is based on his evaluation of data over a long sweep of economic\nhistory. He has noted a decrease in total factor productivity, a decline in the growth rate of\nhuman capital, reduced hours per worker, and a decline in labor force participation rates. He\ndates the beginning of stagnation in these factors to 1972. For the 80 years before then,\nGordon asserts that economic growth was sparked by three great inventions: the electric light\nbulb, the internal combustion engine, and wireless signals. He noted that these three\ninventions eventually led to rounds of spinoffs that transformed society. Gordon sees no such\nround of spinoffs from the IT revolution, biotech, or such advances as 3-D printing.3\nEconomic historians such as Joel Mokyr are a bit more cautious, believing much as I do that it is\n\n2\n\nSee Cowen, The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and\nWill (Eventually) Feel Better.\n3\nGordon believes that future developments from existing or even yet-to-be-invented technologies are reasonably\npredictable, for instance, citing Jules Verne as one such visionary. I don’t see why he then chooses to ignore the\nimagination of Gene Roddenberry: Think iPhones, needleless injections, and touch-screen computers, to name a\nfew.\n\n3\n\n\fnearly impossible to predict the state of future technology.4 He notes that the 20th century\nexperienced considerable technological advancement, even in the face of considerable\nheadwinds, including two world wars, a cold war, and the Great Depression. Some might\nargue, however, that the world wars were not a headwind but a boost to technological\nadvancement.\nIt also may be that some impediments to innovation are not endemic to the nature or science\nof technological progress, but instead they are created by governments and thus can be\nreversed. For example, does increased regulation make the development of new drugs more\ncostly and risky? Could the significant increase in financial regulation after the financial crisis\nreduce the productivity of intermediation and thus impede investment and possibly the rate of\ngrowth? Or have increased taxes on the returns to saving and investment to support transfer\nprograms potentially reduced productivity growth? Regulatory and tax burdens can often act\nto reduce entrepreneurial activity and innovation and thus retard productivity growth. Such\ncosts must be weighed against any perceived benefits of such burdens.\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee are very optimistic about the future. They believe that we are at an\ninflection point and that a substantial period of more robust economic growth awaits us in the\nnot-too-distant future. 5 They point out that many revolutionary discoveries, such as DNA\nsequencing, occurred by creatively stringing together prior scientific procedures. They point\nout that the improvements in computational speeds and algorithmic developments are making\ncomputers capable of stringing together ideas, which could result in significant improvements\nin productivity.\nI believe technological advancement and the increased productivity it can foster is the\noverwhelming driving force behind economic growth. Demographic factors that may drive\n\n4\n\nSee Mokyr, “The Next Age of Invention.”\nSee Brynjolfsson and McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant\nTechnologies.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n\fhours per worker and labor force participation are relatively insignificant when compared with\ninnovation’s effects on productivity. After all, the remarkable growth of the 20th century\noccurred with a significant decline in the workweek from 60 hours to less than 40, as well as a\nsignificant increase in vacation or leisure time. It is hard to envision a decline of similar\nmagnitude going forward. Thus, I continue to have faith in the promise of human ingenuity and\ndo not envision the dire outcomes envisioned by Gordon.6 That does not mean that we won’t\nexperience spurts of unusually high- and low-productivity growth, but those periods are likely\nto be identified and understood only well after the fact.\nThe arguments presented by both sides of the secular stagnation debate highlight that the\nfuture could unfold in very different ways. I think there is no doubt that longer-term growth\nrates can and do vary, and thus, longer-term real interest rates also vary. Yet, such movements\ntend to occur gradually and are very difficult to assess with any precision in real time. As my\ndiscussion suggests, we should focus on policies designed to enhance innovation and\nproductivity if we are to continue to improve per capita consumption and general economic\nwelfare.\nMonetary Policy\nHow do variations in the longer-term growth rate of the economy, and thus the longer-term\nreal rate of interest, affect monetary policy? First, I want to reiterate that long-term growth is\nprimarily determined by productivity growth. Monetary policy is not an appropriate tool for\naddressing perceived declines in productivity. However, assessments of long-run potential\ngrowth can influence the setting of monetary policy because they influence the steady-state or\nlong-run real interest rate. If steady-state real rates are lower, then the so-called “neutral\nsetting of monetary policy” would also be lower. That is, the neutral funds rate would be\nlower.\n\n6\n\nSummers in “U.S. Economic Prospects: Secular Stagnation, Hysteresis, and the Zero Lower Bound” offers different\nconcerns. He argues that the real rate of interest may have declined to very low, or even negative, levels leading\nto the possibility of an inefficient equilibrium and a form of secular stagnation.\n\n5\n\n\fThe debate about a secular decline in growth today thus translates into a discussion of where,\nor how high, the neutral policy rate should be. So, the higher it is relative to the current funds\nrate, the more aggressive policy might have to be and vice versa. But there are other factors\nthat could complicate the policy path. If potential output is lower in the future than previously\nthought, then there is likely to be less “slack” in the current economy than one might think. So,\n“output gaps” are likely to be smaller, which in many policy rules would suggest higher interest\nrates, other things being equal. While a lower steady-state real rate may act to shift down the\nneutral rate, the effects on the dynamic path of policy as it returns to the neutral are somewhat\nmore complex.\nWhile the expected neutral funds rate is something that may be relevant, estimating and\ncommunicating a value with any confidence would be challenging. Measuring longer-run\ntrends is a difficult and delicate issue. Because expectations about monetary policy are\nimportant, particularly in financial markets, it may be useful for the FOMC to indicate what\nranges are likely for the neutral federal funds rate. But given the uncertainties, this may be\ndifficult and conveying a false sense of precision may prove to be counterproductive.\nSo, I believe, adjustments to the perceived neutral funds rate should be done with great care\nand discipline. They should not be done in response to the typical cyclical fluctuations in real\nrates. Our ability to truly assess a significant shift in the longer-term real rate is quite limited,\nand, in the presence of such uncertainty and measurement error, one should be careful not to\nconfuse the public.\nConclusions\nIn summary, there is a lively debate about the future of innovation and other factors that shape\nour prospects for growth. My own view is that human ingenuity and innovation will continue to\nbe a source of productivity growth. But that does not mean we should be complacent about\nour future. Productivity is the ultimate means to economic prosperity and we should\n6\n\n\fundertake policies that promote innovation and technological progress and eliminate practices\nthat discourage such progress.\nMonetary policy has a limited role to play in this endeavor except as it can promote a stable\nenvironment to allow these long-run forces to succeed. Yet, the appropriate setting of\nmonetary policy can be affected by the longer-term trends. Failure to adjust to such trends can\nlead to deviations from a central bank’s inflation target. Yet, distinguishing short-run or\ntransitory fluctuations from more permanent or persistent movements in growth and real\ninterest rates is a tricky and difficult task. It is near impossible in real time. These\nconsiderations lead me to believe that monetary policymakers should take great care in making\nsignificant adjustments in their view of the neutral policy rate.\nWe live in a constantly changing world and one that will hopefully be full of surprising new\ndevelopments that enhance economic welfare.\nReferences\nBrynjolfsson, Erik, and Andrew McAfee.

I want to thank our host Axel Weber for\nthat kind introduction and for inviting me to speak at this annual conference and to\nparticipate in the upcoming panel on monetary policy with fellow central bankers. I am\nlooking forward to a lively and interesting discussion.\nIn a few days, on November 16, 2014, we will mark the 100th anniversary of the date\nwhen the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, each independently chartered with oversight by a\nBoard of Governors in Washington, D.C, first opened their doors. Of course, among\ncentral banks, this makes the Fed the new kid on the block compared with the Bank of\nEngland; it also makes the Fed perhaps an older sibling to the ECB. I view the\ndecentralized structure of the Federal Reserve as one of its great strengths. However, it\nrequires that I begin by reminding you that the views I express this morning are my own\n1\n\n\fand do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic Conditions\nLet me begin with an update on the U.S. economy. The U.S. is now more than five years\ninto a steady, if unremarkable, recovery that began in June 2009. The unemployment\nrate has gone from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.8 percent in October of\nthis year. Gross domestic product (GDP) declined to a 2.1 percent annual rate in the\nfirst quarter of 2014 due to a severe winter. However, second-quarter GDP growth\nrebounded to 4.6 percent. The advance estimate for the third-quarter GDP growth is a\nsolid 3.5 percent.\nPersonal consumption, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. GDP, has\nrecovered from 1.2 percent growth in the first quarter, to average 2.2 percent over the\nsecond and third quarters.\nI anticipate that consumer and business spending will help real GDP to grow at about 3\npercent for the second half of this year and for 2015 before reverting to trend, which I\nsee as about 2.4 percent.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey has proven to be a\nreliable indicator of manufacturing trends in the U.S. In October, manufacturers\nreported the eighth consecutive month in positive territory and well above its average\nnonrecession level. The survey’s future activity indexes also remained at high levels,\nsuggesting continued optimism about manufacturing growth. In addition, the\nPhiladelphia Fed now releases a monthly Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey,\nwhich showed that the region’s service sectors continued to grow in October, with\nimprovement in general activity, new orders, and sales or revenues. Nonmanufacturing\nfirms also continue to be optimistic about activity during the next six months.\n2\n\n\fLast week’s employment numbers showed employers adding 214,000 jobs in October.\nRevisions for September and August added 31,000 more jobs than originally estimated.\nInterestingly, what we once thought was a weak jobs report for August now shows we\nadded 203,000 jobs, which means that we have had nine months of job growth above\n200,000 for the first time in nearly 20 years. In all, employers have added more than 2.3\nmillion jobs thus far in 2014, at an average pace of 229,000 per month through October.\nThe unemployment rate in October was 5.8 percent, well below the 6.7 percent we\nexperienced in December 2013. Whereas the headline U3 measure fell 0.9 percentage\npoints since December 2013, the broader U6 measure, which includes discouraged\nworkers and involuntary part-time workers, dropped 1.6 points, from 13.1 percent to\n11.5 percent, its lowest since September 2008.\nThe unemployment rate continues to fall faster than many policymakers had been\nforecasting. For instance, in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), submitted in\nDecember 2013, the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for the\nunemployment rate at the end of 2014 was 6.3 to 6.6 percent, dropping to 5.8 to 6.1\npercent at the end of 2015. We have clearly exceeded these expectations. At 5.8\npercent, the unemployment rate is already notably below where the Committee\nthought it would be at the end of 2014 and is at the low point in the range expected at\nthe end of 2015. Thus, it is fair to say that we are at least a year ahead of where we\nthought we would be when we started to taper asset purchases.\nThis is not to claim that all is rosy in the labor markets. Many Americans remain\nfrustrated and disappointed in their jobs and job prospects. For example, a large\ncontingent of those working part time for economic reasons would like to be working\nfull time. Nonetheless, we have to acknowledge that significant progress has been\nmade.\n3\n\n\fInflation remains somewhat below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent, but it has\nrisen since last year. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. In\nOctober 2013, inflation stood at 0.9 percent. The most recent reading for September\n2014 was 1.4 percent. Other measures of inflation have risen modestly as well. While\ninflation remains somewhat below the Fed’s target, the gap seems to be gradually\nclosing.\nAs noted by the FOMC in the October 2014 statement, the Committee believes it is\nunlikely that inflation will remain persistently below our long-term goal. The FOMC has\nstated that it expects the inflation rate to rise gradually to the 2 percent target, and I\nagree with that assessment. However, over the next quarter or two, headline inflation\nis likely to ease somewhat, reflecting the decline in the dollar price of oil and other\ntemporary factors. But looking through such transitory changes in relative prices, the\nFOMC sees underlying inflation gradually moving toward its 2 percent target. Thus,\nsince last year, the economy has moved closer to the Committee’s goals and has done\nso more quickly than anticipated.\nMonetary Policy\nSo, let me turn to some thoughts on monetary policy. The Fed has taken extraordinary\nmonetary policy actions, keeping the federal funds rate near zero for nearly six years\nand expanding its balance sheet to about $4.5 trillion.\nYet, the recovery began over five years ago, and the unemployment rate has declined\nfrom 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.8 percent now. Whether you believe that the\nlabor market has fully recovered or not, it is clear that the economy has made\nconsiderable progress toward full employment and price stability. We are no longer in\nthe depths of a financial crisis nor is the labor market in the same dire straits it was five\n4\n\n\fyears ago. To me, that means we should no longer be conducting monetary policy as if\nwe were still in the midst of a financial crisis or in the depths of a recession.\nIn its October statement, the FOMC reaffirmed its highly accommodative stance. In\ndoing so, it acknowledged that the economy had made significant progress. Therefore,\nas widely anticipated, the Committee brought to a close its asset purchase program.\nHowever, the Committee indicated that it would continue its practice of reinvesting\nprincipal payments. This should maintain the size of the Fed’s balance sheet at its\ncurrent, and sizable, level.\nThe Committee also adjusted its language somewhat regarding the expected path of\ninterest rates — the federal funds rate more specifically. In particular, the Committee\nreiterated its assessment that it would likely maintain the current target range of 0 to ¼\npercent for the fed funds rate for a “considerable time” after the end of the purchases.\nAs some of you may be aware, I objected to this forward guidance in both the July and\nSeptember meetings because it conveyed a date-based approach to guidance rather\nthan a data-based approach. I also objected to the fact that it failed to acknowledge the\nprogress made during the last year toward full employment and price stability.\nWhile the Committee retained the “considerable time” language, it added clarity by\nstressing the fact that the decision to lift the interest rate target would be driven by the\ndata. The Committee explicitly noted that should the economy make faster progress\nthan anticipated toward its goals, liftoff could occur earlier, and if progress was slower\nthan anticipated, liftoff could be delayed. From my perspective, this is the operative\nlanguage and it makes clear that the Committee intends for policy to be datadependent. It provides a start, but we could offer greater clarity as I will explain in a\nmoment.\nAs I said, we have moved much closer to our goals since last year, and, accordingly, the\nstance of monetary policy should reflect such progress and begin to adjust gradually.\n5\n\n\fThat is the essence of being data dependent. Given the progress to date, we must\nacknowledge and thus prepare the markets for the fact that interest rates may begin to\nincrease sooner than previously anticipated. I felt that adjusting our language was the\nappropriate first step in responding to better-than-anticipated economic conditions.\nMore generally, how do I think about the stance of policy and how it should be adjusted\nas the economy evolves? My view is informed by realized and projected economic\nprogress toward our goals. But it is also influenced by guidance gained from the\nconduct of past monetary policy — that is, historical experience. In particular, my views\non the appropriate funds rate setting are — and continue to be — informed by Taylortype monetary policy rules that depict the past behavior of monetary policy in response\nto deviation from its desired inflation target and economic activity from its natural or\nefficient level. I find such rules useful for benchmarking my policy prescriptions. These\nrules have been widely investigated and have been shown to be robust in that they\ndeliver good results in a wide variety of models and circumstances.\nThe guidance I take from such robust rules is that we should no longer consider\nmonetary policy as being constrained by the zero lower bound. A variety of these rules,\nwhich I discussed in a speech earlier this summer, indicates that given the current\ninflation rate of just under our target of 2 percent and the current unemployment rate\nof 5.8 percent, the funds rate should be above zero or should be lifting off in the very\nnear future. 1 In fact, maintaining a funds rate target near zero is unprecedented under\nsuch circumstances and, as such, could pose risks to the economy in the years ahead,\nincluding higher inflation and financial instability.\n\n1\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Systematic Monetary Policy and Communication,” remarks to the Economic Club of\nNew York, New York, NY, June 24, 2014.\n\n6\n\n\fThere is a point of view that rates cannot be raised because the labor market has not\ncompletely healed. That is, we must wait, maintaining our current stance of policy until\nwe have achieved our goals. I think this is a risky strategy for three reasons.\nFirst, we do not know how to confidently determine whether the labor market is fully\nhealed or when we have reached full employment. In January 2012, the FOMC affirmed\nin its statement of longer run goals and strategies that, “The maximum level of\nemployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be\ndirectly measurable.” Chair Yellen gave an excellent speech at the Jackson Hole\nconference in August that highlighted some of the structural and nonmonetary factors\naffecting the labor market. Economists don’t fully understand the degree to which\nthese factors may be influencing our efforts to assess the meaning and measurement of\nfull employment.\nSecond, if we wait until we are certain that the labor market has fully recovered before\nbeginning to raise rates, policy will be far behind the curve. One risk of waiting is that\nthe Committee may be forced to raise rates very quickly to prevent an increase in\ninflation. In so doing, this may create unnecessary volatility and a rapid tightening of\nfinancial conditions — either of which could be disruptive to the economy.\nThis would represent a return of the so-called “go-stop” policies of the past. Such\nlanguage was used to describe episodes when the Fed was aggressively providing\nmonetary accommodation to stimulate employment and the economy — the go phase\n— only to find itself forced to apply the brakes abruptly to prevent a rapid uptick in\ninflation — the stop phase. This approach to policy led to more volatility and was more\ndisruptive than many found desirable.\n\n7\n\n\fA third risk to waiting is that the zero interest rate policy has generated a very\naggressive reach for yield as investors take on either credit or duration risk to earn\nhigher returns. While the Fed is attempting to monitor such behavior, it is difficult to\nknow how or where the consequences of such actions may show up. It seems to me\nthat the law of unintended consequences looms large in this arena.\nFor these reasons, I would prefer that we start to raise rates sooner rather than later.\nThis may allow us to increase rates more gradually as the data improve rather than face\nthe prospect of a more abrupt increase in rates to catch up with market forces, which\ncould be the outcome of a prolonged delay in our willingness to act. Of course, financial\nmarkets are not always patient, so some volatility will be unavoidable.\nOf course, there are also risks of moving too soon as tightening financial conditions\ncould stifle a fragile recovery, and some argue that this is the greater risk. However, it is\nimportant to recognize that rates always rise during a recovery — always. Thus, rising\nrates are not inconsistent with a continuing recovery. The inflation-adjusted or real\nfederal funds rate in the U.S. is notably negative, and it has been for some time. A\nnegative real rate is neither sustainable nor desirable when an economy is growing at 2\nto 3 percent and is near full employment.\nIn addition, by referring to historical experience as captured in some of the rules I\nmentioned, we can determine, to a degree, the economic conditions that have been\nconsistent with rising rates in the past. And as I discussed, these rules suggest that,\ngiven current conditions, we should begin raising rates in the near future. Moreover, it\nis important to recognize that these rule-like guidelines take into account the fact that\ninflation is running below our target. They do not tell us that we should keep rates at\nzero until inflation rises to 2 percent any more than they tell us to keep rates at zero\nuntil we reach full employment. They tell us that the stance of policy should be\ncalibrated and adjusted based on how far the economy is from our goals. We are closer\n8\n\n\fto our goals than we have been in quite some time. The stance of monetary policy\nshould reflect such progress.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I remain positive about the U.S. economic outlook. Growth in the second\nand third quarters has rebounded, demonstrating that the effects of the wintry first\nquarter were indeed transitory. Thus, I expect growth will average about 3 percent for\nthe remainder of this year and in 2015, before settling back down to long-term growth\nlevels of about 2.4 percent.\nThe unemployment rate continues to improve more quickly than many had expected.\nWe are now approaching the rate that many policymakers view as a long-run\nsustainable value. Further, numerous labor market indicators continue to show broad\nimprovement and inflation is not appreciably below our 2 percent goal.\nBeginning to raise rates sooner rather than later reduces the chance that inflation will\naccelerate and, in so doing, require policy to become fairly aggressive with perhaps\nunsettling consequences. Waiting too long to begin raising rates — especially waiting\nuntil we have fully met our goals for maximum employment or attained our inflation\ntarget of 2 percent — is risky because doing so could put monetary policy behind the\ncurve. Such policies could lead to a return to abrupt go-stop policies, which in the past\nhave led to unwelcome volatility. Finally, delay is likely to increase the risk of\noverstaying our welcome at the zero bound, thus fostering unintended consequences\nfor financial stability.\nIf monetary policy is to be truly data dependent, then our stance of policy must change\nwith the data. Changing the forward guidance to provide greater clarity about the\npolicymakers’ reaction function would strengthen accountability and afford us the\nflexibility to gradually adjust rates as the economy evolves.\n\n9\n\n\f"

One month from\ntoday, on November 16, 2014, we will mark the 100th anniversary of the date when the\n12 Federal Reserve Banks, each independently chartered by Congress, first opened their\ndoors to begin serving our nation’s economy. That opening day in Philadelphia and in\nthe other 11 cities was the outcome of the Federal Reserve Act, which was signed into\nlaw by President Woodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913.\nWilson is credited with engineering a compromise that created our nation’s\ndecentralized central bank. To balance economic and geographic interests, Congress\ncreated a Federal Reserve System of regional Reserve Banks with oversight provided by\n1\n\n\fa Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This decentralized structure is one of our\ngreat strengths and mirrors the federalist framework of the nation. However, it requires\nthat I begin by reminding you that the views I express this morning are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nSince we are so close to this centennial milestone, I thought I would begin with a little\nbackground about how the Fed works and how we are structured before I offer some\nthoughts on the economic outlook and monetary policy.\nExactly what are these nearly 100-year-old institutions? The Reserve Banks perform\nseveral roles. They distribute currency, act as a bankers’ bank, and serve as the bank for\nthe U.S. Treasury. They also play a critical role in supervising many banks and bank\nholding companies across the country. The 12 Reserve Banks also serve as the eyes and\nears of our central bank in assessing the economic pulse of Main Street as it formulates\nand implements monetary policy.\nEach Reserve Bank has a nine-member board of directors selected to represent a crosssection of banking, commercial, and community interests. These directors fulfill the\ntraditional governance role, but they also provide valuable insights into economic and\nfinancial conditions, which contribute to our assessment of the economy.\nThe Reserve Banks seek to stay in touch with Main Street in other ways. Some have\nBranch offices with their own boards, and all have a variety of advisory councils.\nThe Federal Reserve Banks also collect and analyze data about economic activity.\nHowever, published data are generally looking backward at the last month or the last\nquarter. So, the viewpoints we gather through our boards and advisory councils, and\nour outreach to businesses and communities through events like this help us add a real2\n\n\ftime perspective to the data and help us form a rich and detailed mosaic of our nation’s\neconomy.\nWithin the Federal Reserve, the body that considers this mosaic as it makes monetary\npolicy decisions is the FOMC. Here again, Congress has designed the System with a\nnumber of checks and balances. Since 1935, the composition of the FOMC has included\nthe seven Governors in Washington, D.C., who are appointed by the President of the\nUnited States and confirmed by the Senate, as well as the president of the New York\nFed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms as members on\na rotating basis. Philadelphia votes this year, but whether we vote or not, all Reserve\nBank presidents attend the FOMC meetings, participate in the discussions, and\ncontribute to the Committee’s assessment of the economy and the policy options.\nThe FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings each year to set monetary policy. In\nnormal times, the Committee votes to adjust short-term interest rates to achieve the\ngoals of monetary policy that Congress has set for us. The goals for monetary policy are\narticulated in the Federal Reserve Act and specify that the FOMC “shall maintain long\nrun growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s\nlong run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of\nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since\nmoderate long-term interest rates generally result when prices are stable, many have\ninterpreted these instructions as being a dual mandate to promote maximum\nsustainable employment and price stability.\nEconomic Conditions\nSo, with that background, let me turn to an overview of the U.S. economy as we enter\nthe fourth quarter of 2014. The economic expansion began more than five years ago in\nJune 2009. While the pace has been sluggish and uneven, I believe progress is\nundeniable. In fact, I remain optimistic about the prospects ahead.\n3\n\n\fThis year began with a harsh winter, which proved to be highly disruptive to the\neconomy. Gross domestic product (GDP) declined at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the\nfirst quarter. But second-quarter GDP growth rebounded to 4.6 percent, according to\nthe most recent estimates. In the second quarter, the strongest recoveries were in\ncategories that were most directly affected by the first quarter’s severe weather,\nincluding investment in equipment, residential structures, inventory accumulation, and\nexports.\nPersonal consumption, the largest spending sector of the economy, slowed during the\nfirst quarter to 1.2 percent. After all, it is hard to go shopping when snow and ice keep\nyou from getting out of your house or driveway. In the second quarter, personal\nconsumption growth roughly doubled to 2.5 percent. Purchases of durable goods, such\nas automobiles, advanced at an annualized rate of 14.1 percent.\nI anticipate that consumer and business spending will help real GDP to grow at about 3\npercent for the remainder of this year and next before reverting to trend, which I see as\nabout 2.4 percent.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey has proven to be a\nreliable indicator of national manufacturing trends in the U.S. We will get October’s\nreading just after this meeting at 10 a.m., but September’s reading was the seventh\nconsecutive month in positive territory. The survey’s future activity indexes remained at\nhigh readings, suggesting continued optimism about manufacturing growth. In late\nSeptember, the Bank also officially launched a monthly Nonmanufacturing Business\nOutlook Survey, which we have been conducting since March 2011. The latest results\nfrom nonmanufacturing firms suggest continued expansion in the region.\nThe jobs report for September was also very strong, with employers adding 248,000 jobs\n4\n\n\fin the month nationwide. Additionally, the initial low estimate for August was revised\nupward, as was the estimate for July. These revisions added 69,000 more jobs. In all,\nemployers have added more than 2 million jobs thus far in 2014, at an average pace of\n227,000 per month through September.\nThe unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent, marking its lowest level since July 2008 and\nwell below the 6.7 percent we experienced in December 2013. Even the broader U6\nmeasure, which includes discouraged workers and involuntary part-time workers,\ndropped to 11.8 percent, its lowest since October 2008 and down from 13.1 percent in\nDecember 2013.\nThe unemployment rate continues to fall faster than many policymakers had been\nforecasting. For instance, in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) submitted in\nDecember 2013, the central tendency of FOMC participants was an unemployment rate\nof 6.3 to 6.6 percent at the end of 2014, and by the end of 2015, the central tendency\nwas expected to be 5.8 to 6.1 percent. We have clearly exceeded these expectations.\nThe unemployment rate is now below where the Committee thought it would be at the\nend of 2014 and is now within the range expected at the end of 2015. Thus, it is fair to\nsay that we are at least a year ahead of where we thought we would be when we\nstarted to taper asset purchases. In fact, in September, the central tendency was\nlowered yet again to 5.9 from 6.0 percent for 2014 and to 5.4 from 5.6 percent by the\nend of 2015. We reached our year-end number for 2014 weeks later. How soon will we\nreach the year-end 2015 number?\nIn Pennsylvania, job growth has been positive as well. The state added more than\n47,000 jobs over the past 12 months. The August unemployment rate in Pennsylvania\nwas 5.8 percent, down 1.6 points from a year ago and down from a peak of 8.7 percent\nimmediately following the recession.\n\n5\n\n\fThis is not to claim that all is rosy in the labor markets. Many Americans remain\nfrustrated and disappointed in their jobs and job prospects. For example, a large\ncontingent of those working part time for economic reasons would like to be working\nfull time. Nonetheless, we have to acknowledge that significant progress has been\nmade.\nInflation remains somewhat below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent, but it appears\nto be drifting upward. Headline inflation as measured by year-over-year change in the\nconsumer price index, or CPI, was 1.7 in August, down from 2 percent in July. That\nbroke a four-month streak of inflation at or above the 2 percent level. The Fed’s\npreferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. In December 2013, inflation stood\nat 1.2 percent. The most recent reading for August 2014 was 1.5 percent. Compare\nthat with the December 2013 SEP estimates for 2014, and you will find that we are\ncurrently in line with the FOMC’s central tendency of 1.4 to 1.6 percent for PCE inflation.\nIn the September SEP, FOMC participants left their assessment of inflation unchanged\nwith a central tendency for PCE inflation by the fourth quarter of 2014 to between 1.5\nand 1.7 percent. The Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Survey of Professional Forecasters\nalso increased its average estimate of headline PCE inflation to 1.8 percent in 2014, up\nfrom 1.6 percent in the last survey. The survey also increased the estimate of PCE\ninflation to 2.0 percent in 2015, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous estimate.\nThe FOMC has stated that it expects the inflation rate to gradually rise to the 2 percent\ntarget, and I agree with that assessment.\nSince last year, the economy has moved closer to the Committee’s goals and has done\nso more quickly than anticipated. Yet, the stance of policy and its projected path\nprovided by the Committee have not changed.\n\n6\n\n\fMonetary Policy\nSo, let me turn to some thoughts on monetary policy, including why I departed from the\nmajority view at the July and September FOMC meetings.\nThe Fed has taken extraordinary monetary policy actions, keeping the federal funds rate\nnear zero for nearly six years and expanding its balance sheet to more than $4.5 trillion.\nYet, the recovery began over five years ago, and the unemployment rate has declined\nfrom 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.9 percent now. Whether you believe that the\nlabor market has fully recovered or not, it is clear that we have made considerable\nprogress toward full employment and price stability. We are no longer in the depths of\na financial crisis nor is the labor market in the same dire straits it was five years ago.\nIn its July and September statements, the FOMC reaffirmed its highly accommodative\nstance. The statements noted that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0\nto ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress\n— both realized and expected — toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2\npercent inflation.” In assessing this progress, the Committee reported that it will look at\na wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial\ndevelopments.\nThe FOMC also noted, based on its assessment of these factors, “that it likely will be\nappropriate to keep its target federal funds rate near zero for a considerable time after\nthe asset purchase program ends …”\nI objected to this forward guidance regarding the expected timing for raising the funds\nrate because I believe this language is no longer appropriate or warranted. Appropriate\nmonetary policy must respond to the data. I believe that by indicating that the FOMC\n7\n\n\fcontinues to anticipate that it will be a “considerable time” after the end of asset\npurchases before it is likely that the Committee will raise interest rates does not reflect\nthe significant progress made toward our goals. It also limits the Committee’s flexibility\nto take action going forward.\nWe have moved much closer to our goals since last December, and, accordingly, the\nstance of monetary policy should reflect such progress and begin to adjust gradually.\nThat is the essence of being data dependent. In the current context, we must\nacknowledge and thus prepare the markets for the fact that interest rates may begin to\nincrease sooner than previously anticipated. I felt that adjusting our language was the\nappropriate first step in responding to better-than-anticipated economic conditions.\nMy view is informed, as I have indicated, by realized and projected economic progress\ntoward our goals. But it is also influenced by guidance gained from the historical\nconduct of past monetary policy. In particular, my views on the appropriate funds rate\nsetting are — and continue to be — informed by Taylor-type monetary policy rules that\ndepict the past behavior of monetary policy in response to deviation from its desired\ninflation target and economic activity from its natural or efficient level. I find such rules\nuseful for benchmarking my policy prescriptions. These rules have been widely\ninvestigated and have been shown to be robust in that they deliver good results in a\nwide variety of models and circumstances.\nThe guidance I take from such robust rules is that we should no longer consider\nmonetary policy as being constrained by the zero lower bound. A variety of these rules,\nwhich I discussed in a speech earlier this summer, indicates that given the current\ninflation rate of just under our target of 2 percent and the current unemployment rate\nof 5.9 percent, the funds rate should be above zero or should be lifting off in the very\n\n8\n\n\fnear future. 1 In fact, maintaining a funds rate target near zero is unprecedented under\nsuch circumstances and as such could pose risks to the economy in the years ahead,\nincluding higher inflation and financial instability.\nI am not suggesting that rates should necessarily be increased now. Our first task is to\nchange the language in a way that allows for liftoff sooner than many now anticipate\nand sooner than suggested by our current guidance. Raising rates sooner rather than\nlater also reduces the chance that inflation will accelerate and require policy to become\nfairly aggressive with perhaps unsettling consequences. Thus, I believe that our forward\nguidance should be adjusted to reflect economic realities and to give us the flexibility to\nrespond sooner and more gradually to the evolution of the economy.\nThere is a point of view that rates cannot be raised because the labor market has not\ncompletely healed. That is, we must wait, maintaining our current stance of policy until\nwe have achieved our goals. I think this is a risky strategy for three reasons.\nFirst, we do not know how to confidently determine whether the labor market is fully\nhealed or when we have reached full employment. In January 2012, the FOMC affirmed\nin its statement of longer run goals and strategies that, “The maximum level of\nemployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market. These factors, such as demographics or advancements in\ntechnology, may change over time and may not be directly measurable.” Chair Yellen\ngave an excellent speech at the Jackson Hole conference in August that highlighted\nsome of the structural and nonmonetary factors affecting the labor market. Economists\ndon’t fully understand how these factors may be influencing our efforts to assess the\nmeaning and measurement of full employment.\n\n1\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Systematic Monetary Policy and Communication,” remarks to the Economic Club of\nNew York, New York, NY, June 24, 2014.\n\n9\n\n\fSecond, if we wait until we are certain that the labor market has fully recovered before\nbeginning to raise rates, policy will be far behind the curve. One risk of waiting is that\nthe Committee may be forced to raise rates very quickly to prevent an increase in\ninflation. In so doing, this may create unnecessary volatility and a rapid tightening of\nfinancial conditions — either of which could be disruptive to the economy.\nThis would represent a return of the so-called “go-stop” policies of the past.

It seems to me\nthat the law of unintended consequences looms large in this arena.\nFor these reasons, I would prefer that we start to raise rates sooner rather than later.\nThis may allow us to increase rates more gradually as the data improve rather than face\nthe prospect of a more abrupt increase in rates to catch up with market forces, which\ncould be the outcome of a prolonged delay in our willingness to act.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I remain positive about the economic outlook. Second quarter growth\nhas rebounded after the disappointing first quarter caused by the harsh winter. At the\nend of this month, we will get the first look at the third quarter, which I expect will help\nus reach an average of about 3 percent for the remainder of this year and in 2015,\n10\n\n\fbefore settling back down to long-term growth levels of about 2.4 percent.\nThe unemployment rate continues to improve more quickly than many had expected.\nWe are now approaching the rate that many policymakers view as a long-run\nsustainable value. Inflation appears to be drifting up toward our 2 percent goal.\nRaising rates sooner rather than later reduces the chance that inflation will accelerate\nand, in so doing, require policy to become fairly aggressive with perhaps unsettling\nconsequences. Waiting too long to begin raising rates — especially waiting until we\nhave fully met our goals for maximum employment — is risky because we cannot know\nwhen we have arrived. That could also put monetary policy behind the curve and could\nlead to a return to abrupt go-stop policies that in the past have led to unwelcome\nvolatility. Finally, delay is likely to increase the risk of overstaying our welcome at the\nzero bound, thus fostering unintended consequences for financial stability.\nIf monetary policy is to be truly data dependent, then our stance of policy must begin to\nchange. I’m not suggesting a rate increase now, but changing the forward guidance\nwould at least afford us the flexibility to gradually raise rates beginning earlier than\ncurrently anticipated.\n\n11\n\n\f"

As you may know, this is the centennial year for the Federal Reserve. On December\n23, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the act that created the Federal Reserve\nSystem, and on November 16, 1914, the 12 Reserve Banks officially opened their doors as\nindependently chartered banks. Oversight was assigned to a Board of Governors in\nWashington, D.C. That decentralized structure is one of our great strengths, but it requires that\nI begin by reminding you that the views I express this morning are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fSince this is a professional society of business editors and writers, I thought I would discuss the\nbenefits of clear communications as part of a systematic, rule-like approach to setting\nmonetary policy.\n\nDuring the past eight years, I have spoken and written frequently about ways to improve the\nframework we use for making monetary policy decisions. In my view, the monetary policy\nframework is most effective when the central bank:\n•\n\nCommits to a set of clearly articulated objectives that can be feasibly achieved by\nmonetary policy;\n\n•\n\nConducts monetary policy in a systematic or rule-like manner;\n\n•\n\nCommunicates its policies and actions to the public in a clear and transparent way;\nand\n\n•\n\nProtects its independence by maintaining a clear separation of monetary policy from\nfiscal policy.\n\nThese four principles are interrelated, and, as you will see, communication is a key ingredient\nfor a sound policy framework. To its credit, the Federal Reserve has sought to strengthen its\ncommunications and its monetary policy framework in recent years. I have described the\nprocess as like a journey, with each step contributing to a more informed public and a more\ntransparent central bank. While we have made strides over the past several decades, I also\nrecognize that the journey in recent years has taken us into unchartered territory.\nExtraordinary actions by the Fed in response to the Great Recession have presented unique\ncommunications challenges, which have made clarity more difficult. Yet, I believe we have\nnonetheless made progress.\n\nThe Journey Thus Far\nJust consider how far we have come. It was once taken for granted that the central bank was\nsupposed to be secretive and mysterious. The guiding principle was simple: The less said about\nmonetary policy, the better. Indeed, it was not until 1994 that the FOMC began to announce\n2\n\n\fpolicy changes made at its meetings. Before then, the markets were left to infer the policy\naction from the Fed’s behavior in the market.1 Since then, the FOMC has issued statements at\neach meeting, which include a vote tally, along with the views of dissenters. The FOMC now\nexpedites the release of the minutes, publishing them three weeks after each meeting. It also\nreports the economic projections of Committee participants four times a year. These meetings\nare followed by press conferences with the chair of the FOMC. In 2012, the FOMC issued a\nstatement clarifying our longer-run goals and strategy, including an explicit 2 percent target for\ninflation. And the economic projections now include information about the policy path\nassumptions of participants.\n\nThese last two initiatives were based on the recommendations of a subcommittee on\ncommunications led by then Vice Chair Yellen, which included President Evans of Chicago,\nformer Governor Raskin, and myself. This summer, Chair Yellen asked Vice Chair Fischer to lead\na new subcommittee on communications, with Governor Powell, President Williams of San\nFrancisco, and President Mester of Cleveland, to continue to find ways to improve\ncommunications.\n\nClearly Articulating Objectives\nLet’s consider how communications support each of the four principles of sound central\nbanking, beginning with clearly articulating the objectives of monetary policy. But before doing\nso, it is useful to spell out exactly what the FOMC is supposed to do. The Federal Reserve Act\nspecifies the Fed “shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates\ncommensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote\neffectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest\nrates.” Since moderate long-term interest rates generally result when prices are stable, many\nhave interpreted these goals as a dual mandate to manage fluctuations in employment in the\nshort run while preserving price stability in the long run.\n1\n\nSee the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, “Timeline to Transparency,” www.philadelphiafed.org/about-thefed/transparency/ (accessed October 9, 2014).\n\n3\n\n\fHowever, most economists are dubious of the ability of monetary policy to predictably and\nprecisely control employment in the short run, and there is a strong consensus that monetary\npolicy cannot determine employment in the long run. As the FOMC noted in its statement on\nlonger-run goals adopted in 2012, the maximum level of employment is largely determined by\nnonmonetary factors, such as changing demographics, which affect the structure and dynamics\nof the labor market.\n\nIn my view, excessive focus on short-run control of employment weakens the credibility and\neffectiveness of the Fed in achieving its price stability objective. We learned this lesson most\ndramatically during the 1970s when, despite the extensive efforts to reduce unemployment,\nthe Fed essentially failed, and the nation experienced a prolonged period of high\nunemployment and high inflation. The economy paid the price in the form of a deep recession,\nas the Fed sought to restore the credibility of its commitment to price stability.\n\nWhen establishing the longer-term goals and objectives for any organization, and particularly\none that serves the public, it is important that the goals be achievable. Assigning unachievable\ngoals to organizations is a recipe for failure. For the Fed, it could mean a loss of public\nconfidence. I fear that the public has come to expect too much from its central bank and too\nmuch from monetary policy, in particular. We need to heed the words of Nobel Prize winner,\nMilton Friedman. In his 1967 presidential address to the American Economic Association, he\nsaid, “we are in danger of assigning to monetary policy a larger role than it can perform, in\ndanger of asking it to accomplish tasks that it cannot achieve, and as a result, in danger of\npreventing it from making the contribution that it is capable of making.”2\n\nIn my view, the dual mandate has contributed to a view that monetary policy can accomplish\nfar more than it is, perhaps, capable of achieving. Even though the FOMC’s 2012 statement of\n2\n\nSee Milton Friedman, “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, 58:1 (March 1968), pp. 1–17.\n\n4\n\n\fobjectives acknowledged that it is inappropriate to set a fixed goal for employment and that\nmaximum employment is influenced by many factors, the FOMC’s recent policy statements\nhave increasingly given the impression that it wants to achieve an employment goal as quickly\nas possible through aggressive monetary accommodation.\n\nI believe that assigning multiple objectives for the central bank opens the door to highly\ndiscretionary policies, which can be justified by shifting the focus or rationale for action from\ngoal to goal. That is why I have argued that Congress ought to redefine the Fed’s monetary\npolicy goals to focus solely, or at least primarily, on price stability. I base this on two facts:\nMonetary policy has a very limited ability to influence real variables, such as employment. And,\nin a regime with fiat currency, only the central bank can ensure price stability. Indeed, it is the\none goal that the central bank can achieve over the longer run.\n\nSetting clear, achievable objectives is part of the framework. Asking policymakers to pursue\nthose objectives in a systematic, rule-like approach is the second key principle.\n\nThe Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy\nSo, what do I mean by a systematic approach to policy? Quite simply, I mean conducting policy\nin a more rule-like manner. It is difficult for policymakers to choose a systematic rule-like\napproach that would tie their hands and thus limit their discretionary ability. Yet, economists\nhave long been aware of the benefits of rule-like behavior. Dating as far back as 1936, Henry\nSimons discussed how rule-like behavior is preferable to pure discretion.3 More recently, Finn\nKydland and Ed Prescott in their Nobel Prize-winning work showed that a credible commitment\nby policymakers to behave in a systematic rule-like manner leads to better outcomes than\ndiscretion.4 Since then, numerous papers using a variety of models have investigated the\nbenefits of rule-like behavior in monetary policy and found that there are indeed significant\n3\n\nHenry C. Simons, “Rules Versus Authorities in Monetary Policy,” Journal of Political Economy, 44:1 (February\n1936).\n4\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,”\nJournal of Political Economy, 85 (June 1977), pp. 473–491.\n\n5\n\n\fbenefits.\n\nOne of the reasons that rules work better than discretion is that they are transparent and\ntherefore allow for simpler and more effective communication of policy decisions. Moreover, a\nlarge body of research over the last 40 years has emphasized the important role expectations\nplay in determining economic outcomes. That means more effective communication of the\ndecision-making process leads to more accurate expectations. When policy is set\nsystematically, the public and financial market participants can form more accurate\nexpectations about policy. Policy is then less of a source of instability or uncertainty.\n\nThe appropriate way to make policy systematic, or rule-like, is to base policy decisions on\nobservable economic conditions. That is, policymakers should describe the reaction function\nthat determines how the current and future policy rate will be set depending on economic\ndata. I want to emphasize that a reaction function does not mean a timetable or a threshold\nfor action. Monetary policy should be data dependent, not date dependent. And the use of\nthat data must recognize that policymakers are no more certain about future economic\nconditions than anyone else is. Thus, the future path of policy will always be highly uncertain.\nHowever, a reaction function should explain how the policy rate will be determined in the\nfuture as a function of economic conditions.\n\nI also want to clear up some confusion about whether a reaction function is somehow\nmechanical. The science of monetary policy has not reached the point where we can specify a\nsingle optimal rule for setting policy and turn decision-making over to a computer. Judgment is\nstill required. Because we do not know the true model of the economy, I would suggest the\nFOMC begin by considering and reporting on a set of robust policy rules designed to have good\nresults in a variety of models and across various stages of the business cycle. Such robust rules\nrecognize that data are measured imprecisely and are subject to revision.\n\nBy considering such robust rules, the FOMC might be able to move toward a consensus on a\n6\n\n\fqualitative description of its reaction function as an important first step. For example, we\nwould not have to specify the precise mathematical rule but would provide assessments of key\nvariables and then communicate our policy decisions in terms of changes in these key variables.\nIf policy were changed, then we would explain that change in terms of how the variables in our\nresponse function changed. If we choose a consistent set of variables and systematically use\nthem to describe our policy choices, then the public will form more accurate judgments about\nthe likely course of policy. That will reduce uncertainty, promote stability, and lead to greater\ntransparency.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\nAs I mentioned at the outset, communications has been the subject of considerable discussion\nin recent years. It took on heightened importance as the FOMC responded to the financial crisis\nand recession. Since December 2008, the federal funds rate target has been near zero. Since\nthe nominal federal funds rate cannot go below zero, we had to develop alternative policy tools\nin an effort to provide further accommodation to support the recovery, such as the large-scale\nasset purchase program. We also had to figure out how and what to communicate about these\nnew tools. The asset purchase program has had many dimensions, such as the overall volume\nof purchases, the pace of purchases, the kind of assets targeted for purchase, and the criteria\nfor starting and stopping the purchases. Policymakers have tried to fine-tune the program\nalong each dimension while assessing the tradeoffs among them and the tradeoffs with other\npolicy tools, such as the traditional funds rate decision. With so many moving parts to our\npolicy framework, it is not surprising that communication is very complicated and challenging.\n\nThe task was further complicated because one of the unconventional measures employed by\nthe FOMC was so-called forward guidance. Forward guidance is the central banker’s term for\ncommunications about the future path of policy. One way to think of forward guidance is that\nit is just another step toward increased transparency and effective communication of monetary\npolicy. However, another rationale for forward guidance is that it is a way of increasing\naccommodation in a period when the policy rate is at or near the zero lower bound. Some\n7\n\n\fmodels suggest that when you are at the zero lower bound, it can be desirable, or optimal, to\nindicate that future policy rates will be kept “lower for longer” than might otherwise be the\ncase. In this approach, such a commitment would tend to raise inflation expectations and\nlower long-term nominal rates, thereby inducing households and businesses to spend more\ntoday.\n\nThis approach asks more of forward guidance than just articulating a reaction function. It takes\nmore credibility and commitment because it requires policymakers to directly influence and\nmanage the public’s beliefs about the future policy path in ways that are different from how\nthey may have behaved in the past. As I have indicated in previous speeches, this approach to\nforward guidance can backfire if the policy is misunderstood.5 For example, if the public hears\nthat the policy rate will be lower for longer, it may interpret this news as policymakers saying\nthat they expect the economy to be weaker for longer. If the message is interpreted in that\nway, then the forward guidance will not succeed and may even weaken current spending.\n\nI believe we should think of forward guidance as part of systematic approach to decisionmaking and not an independent policy tool that attempts to bend expectations. As monetary\npolicy becomes normalized, we have the opportunity to ensure the public understands that\nforward guidance is an integrated part of a systematic approach to policy.\n\nSo, what additional steps can we take to increase transparency? I think that the FOMC could\nimprove communication and transparency by preparing a more comprehensive monetary\npolicy report on a regular basis, perhaps quarterly. Currently, the Chair testifies before\nCongress twice a year and submits an accompanying written report. In addition, the Chair\nholds press briefings four times a year when participants present their economic projections. I\nthink there is an opportunity to combine these efforts into a more comprehensive report on\nmonetary policy as many other countries do. The report would offer an opportunity to\n5\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Forward Guidance,” speech to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research’s\n(SIEPR) Associates Meeting, February 12, 2013, Stanford, CA.\n\n8\n\n\freinforce the underlying policy framework and how it relates to current and expected economic\nconditions. Ideally, this report would incorporate a discussion of robust systematic rules I\nreferred to a moment ago. Such a discussion would provide the opportunity to inform the\npublic about the expected future path of policy conditioned on how the economy evolves.\n\nPublishing a monetary policy report with an assessment of the likely near-term path of policy\nrates, in conjunction with its economic forecast, would also provide added discipline for\npolicymakers to stick to a systematic, rule-like approach. Providing information about how that\npath is likely to evolve forces policymakers to think more deeply and systematically about\npolicy. Communication about that path, in turn, gives the public a much deeper understanding\nof the analytical approach that guides monetary policy.\n\nWhile I am discussing transparency, I also want to touch on another misconception. Some\ncommentators express the view that dissent causes dissonance and therefore confuses the\ncommunications. In fact, letting the public know about our debates and differing views is more\ntransparent than hiding behind false consensus.\n\nMonetary policymaking is conducted by committee, and divergent views can and often do exist.\nWhile this can be clumsy at times, such governance mechanisms have great strength in\npreventing institutions from lapsing into groupthink by ensuring that various views are heard in\nan environment that promotes better decisions and outcomes, and they help to preserve the\ncentral bank’s independence and accountability.\n\nOpen dialogue and diversity of views leads to better policy decisions and is the primary means\nby which new ideas are gradually incorporated into our monetary policy framework. Thus, I\nbelieve diversity of thought is a sign of thoughtful progress. I have often quoted the famous\nAmerican journalist Walter Lippmann who said, “Where all men think alike, no one thinks very\nmuch.” I think it is healthy for the American public to know that we debate some of the same\nissues that those outside the Fed debate. Hiding such debate behind a unanimous vote does\n9\n\n\fnothing to promote true transparency.\n\nPreserving Independence\nFinally, I believe that the fundamental concept of a decentralized central bank has great merit,\nin part, because it helps to preserve the independence and maintain the public trust in the\ninstitution. Independence is essential if a central bank is to play its fundamental role in\npreserving the purchasing power of a fiat currency. History is replete with examples of\ngovernments using the power to print money as a substitute for making tough fiscal choices,\nand the results are almost always disastrous.\n\nCentral bank independence is a fundamental tenet of sound central banking and leads to better\neconomic outcomes. But independence must be accompanied by accountability. And\naccountability is more easily achieved when there is transparency. The public can best hold a\ncentral bank accountable when its goals are clearly stated and achievable.\n\nTransparent and clear communications of monetary policy goals and a decision-making\nframework help ensure accountability and preserve central bank independence. Transparency\ncan also enhance a central bank’s credibility. A central bank that is transparent will be less\nwilling to make promises it cannot keep. When policy pronouncements are more credible,\npolicy is more effective. Transparency can also make it easier to explain changes in policy\nwithout damaging the central bank’s credibility.\n\nConclusion\nTo summarize, the FOMC is on a journey to improve communications and the transparency of\nits monetary policy decision-making process. The benefits of transparency are now accepted by\npolicymakers across the globe. Transparency not only improves the effectiveness of monetary\npolicy, it also improves the central bank’s credibility and accountability with the public. The\nFOMC’s recent moves to publish guidelines on its longer-run goals and policy strategy and the\npolicy assumptions that underlie FOMC projections are great strides toward this goal.\n10\n\n\fHowever, more can be done.\n\nIn particular, I believe the FOMC should continue to work toward increasing the public\nunderstanding of how policy will react systematically to changes in economic conditions. I\nbelieve the FOMC should move forward to describe a reaction function and then communicate\nour actions and decisions in terms of this reaction function. A detailed monetary policy report\ncould be a useful vehicle for such enhanced communication.\n\nBecause systematic policy is easily communicated to the public, it will improve the transparency\nand predictability of monetary policy, which reduces policy surprises. Businesses and\nconsumers are more informed about the course of monetary policy because they understand\nhow policymakers are likely to react to changing economic circumstances even if they are not\ncertain what those economic conditions might be. Equally important in my view is that greater\nclarity about policymakers’ reaction function strengthens accountability. Thus, systematic\npolicy, communicated transparently, strengthens accountability and serves to preserve the\ncentral bank’s independence.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Thank you for the opportunity to speak at this 137th annual convention\nof the Pennsylvania Association of Community Bankers. Community banks have a long\nand venerable history in our nation, and the 137 years of the PACB is a powerful\ntestament to your roots as stalwarts in our financial system. I would note that the\nlongevity of this convention means that your organization significantly predates the\n1\n\n\fFederal Reserve System, which is observing its centennial this year. My suspicion is that\nthere are a number of community bankers here today who can trace their corporate\nhistories to firms that petitioned for the establishment of a Federal Reserve Bank in\nPhiladelphia 100 years ago. I actually have two letters here. One from the New Tripoli\nNational Bank dated December 27, 1913, and one from the First National Bank of\nMifflintown dated December 26, 1913, both addressed to William McAdoo, Secretary of\nthe Treasury, requesting the establishment of a Federal Reserve Bank in the City of\nPhiladelphia.\nOver the years, community banking organizations, whether they are state member\nbanks or not, have provided important links between the Federal Reserve Banks and the\nbusinesses and communities your institutions serve. We have reached out and listened\nto community bankers through their representation on our boards of directors and\nadvisory councils, as well as through our ongoing contacts with individual firms and the\nbusiness organizations you serve.\nThe insights we gather from community bankers in our District help me as a policymaker\nbring Main Street perspectives to the national policy table each time the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, or FOMC, meets in Washington. When such information from all\nthe Districts comes together at our meetings, it forms a rich mosaic of our economy that\nhelps shape our monetary policy decisions.\nSo, I want to thank Nick DiFrancesco, president and CEO of the PACB, and Dennis\nCirucci, your chairman, for inviting me here today. I also want to publicly thank Dennis\nfor serving so ably on our Bank’s Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, or\nCDIAC, and as our council’s representative to the Board of Governors.\nMy last opportunity to address the PACB was in September 2007, a very different\neconomic environment than we find ourselves in today. I used that speech seven years\nago to discuss the Federal Reserve’s initial responses to growing financial instability in\nthe housing sector. I explained that the Fed’s role in promoting financial stability rather\n2\n\n\fthan its monetary policy responsibilities had prompted the short-term injection of some\n$68 billion in liquidity through open market operations in early August 2007, a mere 12\nmonths after I joined the Fed. That seems like a long time ago and much has transpired\nsince then. At the time, the FOMC had yet to lower the federal funds rate from its\ntarget of 5.25 percent. Weeks later, though, the FOMC began to lower the federal funds\nrate target and then kept lowering it to essentially zero in December 2008, as the global\nfinancial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession enveloped economies around the world.\nThe rate has been near zero for nearly six years now, and the Fed has augmented its\naggressive policy actions through large-scale asset purchases, now tallying in the\ntrillions, rather than in the billions of dollars.\nToday, I would like to give you my assessment of the U.S. economy and then share some\nthoughts about the stance of monetary policy.\nI should note that my views are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve Board or my colleagues on the FOMC, which will shortly become apparent.\nEconomic Conditions\nSo, let me begin with an overview of the U.S. economy. We are more than five years\ninto a recovery that began in June 2009. While the pace has been sluggish and uneven, I\nbelieve the progress is undeniable. In fact, despite a winter cold spell in the first\nquarter, I remain mostly positive about the prospects ahead.\nThe severe winter led to a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) during the first\nquarter of the year, but second-quarter growth rebounded to 4.2 percent, according to\nthe most recent estimate. This largely confirmed that the disappointing performance in\nthe first quarter was mostly a temporary weather-related slowdown rather than a more\npersistent retrenchment in the ongoing recovery. In the second quarter, the strongest\nrecoveries were in categories most directly affected by the first quarter’s severe\nweather, including investment in equipment, residential structures, inventory\n3\n\n\faccumulation, and exports. Exports declined sharply at an annual rate of 10.1 percent in\nthe first quarter and then jumped 9.5 percent in the second. Total private domestic\ninvestment fell 6.9 percent in the first-quarter freeze but then grew 17.5 percent during\nthe second-quarter thaw.\nPersonal consumption, the largest spending sector of the economy, slowed during the\nfirst quarter to 1.2 percent. In the second quarter, personal consumption growth\napproximately doubled to 2.5 percent. Durable goods, which advanced at an annualized\nrate of 14 percent, were the strongest component of personal consumption in the\nsecond quarter.\nI believe consumer and business spending will help real GDP to grow at about 3 percent\nfor the remainder of this year and next before reverting to trend, which I see as about\n2.4 percent.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey in our region has proven\nto be a reliable indicator of national manufacturing trends in the U.S. In August, the\ndiffusion index of current activity increased for the third consecutive month and had its\nstrongest reading since March 2011. The survey also indicated that expectations for\nmanufacturing activity six months ahead remained strong. Underlying details of the\nreport included strong results for new orders and shipments. The current indicators for\nlabor conditions also suggested continued expansion in employment. The employment\nindex has been positive for 14 months, and the workweek index was positive for the\nsixth month.\nThese data suggest continued improvement in U.S. labor market conditions, despite a\nsomewhat softer August number yesterday, which showed that 142,000 jobs were\nadded to nonfarm U.S. payrolls. However, I prefer to look at longer-term trends rather\nthan monthly numbers that are still subject to revision. Year-to-date monthly average\njob growth has amounted to 215,000 jobs this year, compared with a monthly average\nof 194,000 jobs added last year.\n4\n\n\fDespite the slowdown in August, job creation has improved markedly this year. The\neconomy has created 1.7 million jobs since the start of the year, nearly 10 percent more\nthan the same period in 2013, 20 percent more than in 2012, and 30 percent more than\nin 2011.\nThe unemployment rate was 6.1 percent in August, down more than a full percentage\npoint from a year ago. This means the unemployment rate continues to fall faster than\nmany policymakers had been forecasting. For instance, in the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) submitted in December 2013, the central tendency of FOMC\nparticipants was to end 2014 with an unemployment rate of 6.3 to 6.6 percent, and by\nthe end of 2015, the central tendency was expected to be 5.8 to 6.1 percent. We have\nclearly exceeded expectations. The unemployment rate is below where the Committee\nthought it would be at the end of 2014 and is now within the range expected at the end\nof 2015. Thus, it is fair to say that we are at least a year ahead of where we thought we\nwould be when we started to taper asset purchases.\nIn Pennsylvania, job growth has been positive as well. The state added more than\n54,000 jobs over the past 12 months. July’s unemployment rate in Pennsylvania was 5.7\npercent, down from 7.5 percent a year ago and from a peak of 8.7 percent immediately\nfollowing the recession.\nIt is not just that the unemployment rate has fallen, other measures of labor market\nconditions have improved as well. Long-term unemployment in the nation, those\nunemployed for more than 27 weeks, has dropped by about 1.3 million from a year ago;\nthe duration of unemployment spells has declined; job openings have returned to prerecession levels; and the rate at which employees voluntarily leave their jobs, called the\nquit rate, has risen.\nThis is not to claim that all is rosy in the labor markets. Many Americans remain\nfrustrated and disappointed in their jobs and job prospects. For example, there remains\na large contingent of those working part time for reasons economists don’t fully\n5\n\n\funderstand. Nonetheless, we have to acknowledge that significant progress has been\nmade.\nInflation remains somewhat below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent, but it appears\nto be drifting upward. Headline inflation as measured by year-over-year change in the\nconsumer price index, or CPI, was 2 percent in July, the fourth month at or above that\nlevel. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year change in the price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. In December of last\nyear, that figure stood at 1.2 percent. The most recent reading for July 2014 was 1.6\npercent. Compare that with December 2013 SEP estimates for 2014, and you will find\nthat we are already at the top of the FOMC’s central tendency of 1.4 to 1.6 percent for\nPCE inflation.\nIn the June SEP, FOMC participants modestly increased their assessment of inflation,\nraising the central tendency for PCE inflation by the fourth quarter of 2014 to between\n1.5 and 1.7 percent. The Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Survey of Professional\nForecasters also increased its average estimate of headline PCE inflation to 1.8 percent\nin 2014, up from 1.6 percent in the last survey. The survey also increased the estimate\nof PCE inflation to 2.0 percent in 2015, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous\nestimate. All of these figures suggest that inflation appears to be gradually moving\ncloser to our target of 2 percent and doing so more quickly than anticipated in\nDecember 2013.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me turn to some thoughts on monetary policy, including why I departed from the\nmajority view at the July FOMC meeting.\nAs I noted in the beginning of my remarks, the Fed has taken extraordinary monetary\npolicy actions, keeping the federal funds rate near zero for nearly six years and\nexpanding its balance sheet to more than $4 trillion. Indeed, the balance sheet\n\n6\n\n\fcontinues to expand, so the Fed is still trying to increase accommodation even though\nthe pace of purchases is slowing and is expected to end in October.\nYet, the recovery began over five years ago, and the unemployment rate has declined\nfrom 10 percent in October 2009, to 6.1 percent now. Whether you believe that the\nlabor market has fully recovered or not, it is clear that we have made considerable\nprogress toward full employment and price stability. We are no longer in the depths of\na financial crisis nor is the labor market in the same dire straits it was five years ago.\nIn its July statement, the FOMC reaffirmed its highly accommodative stance. The\nstatement noted that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent\ntarget range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress — both\nrealized and expected — toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent\ninflation.” In assessing this progress, the Committee reported that it will look at a wide\nrange of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of\ninflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.\nThe FOMC also noted, based on its assessment of these factors, “that it likely will be\nappropriate to keep its target federal funds rate near zero for a considerable time after\nthe asset purchase program ends …”\nI objected to this forward guidance regarding the expected timing for raising the funds\nrate because I believe this language is no longer appropriate or warranted. Appropriate\nmonetary policy must respond to the data. I believe that by indicating that the FOMC\ncontinues to anticipate that it will be a “considerable time” after the end of\nasset purchases before it is likely that the Committee will raise interest rates does not\nreflect the significant progress toward our goals. It also limits the Committee’s flexibility\nto take action going forward.\nWe have moved much closer to our goals since last December, and, as we do so, the\nstance of monetary policy should reflect such progress and begin to gradually adjust.\nThat is the essence of being data dependent. In the current context, we must\n7\n\n\facknowledge and thus prepare the markets for the fact that interest rates may begin to\nincrease sooner than previously anticipated. I felt that adjusting our language was the\nappropriate first step in responding to better-than-anticipated economic conditions.\nMy view is informed, as I have indicated, by realized and projected economic progress\ntoward our goals. But it is also influenced by guidance gained from the historical\nconduct of past monetary policy. In particular, my views on the appropriate funds rate\nsetting are — and continue to be — informed by Taylor-type monetary policy rules that\ndepict the past behavior of monetary policy. I find such rules useful for benchmarking\nmy policy prescriptions. These rules have been widely investigated and have been\nshown to be robust, in that they deliver good results in a wide variety of models and\ncircumstances.\nThe guidance I take from such robust rules is that we should no longer consider\nmonetary policy as being constrained by the zero lower bound. A variety of these rules,\nwhich I discussed in a speech earlier this summer, indicates that under current\nconditions the funds rate should already be above zero or should be lifting off in the\nvery near future. 1 I am not suggesting that rates should necessarily be increased now.\nOur first task is to change the language in a way that allows for liftoff sooner than many\nnow anticipate and sooner than suggested by our current guidance. Raising rates\nsooner rather than later also reduces the chance that inflation will accelerate and, in so\ndoing, require policy to become fairly aggressive with perhaps unsettling consequences.\nThus, I believe that our forward guidance should be adjusted to reflect economic\nrealities and to give us the flexibility to respond sooner and more gradually to the\nevolution of the economy.\nThere is a point of view that rates cannot be raised because the labor market has not\ncompletely healed. That is, we must wait, maintaining our current stance of policy until\nwe have achieved our goals. I think this is a risky strategy for two reasons.\n1\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Systematic Monetary Policy and Communication,” remarks to the Economic Club of\nNew York, New York, NY, June 24, 2014.\n\n8\n\n\fFirst, we do not know how to confidently determine whether the labor market is fully\nhealed or when we have reached full employment. In January 2012, the FOMC affirmed\nin its statement of longer run goals and strategies that, “The maximum level of\nemployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be\ndirectly measurable.” Chair Yellen gave an excellent speech at the Jackson Hole\nconference just a couple of weeks ago that highlighted some of the structural and\nnonmonetary factors affecting the labor market. Economists don’t fully understand\nhow these factors may be influencing our efforts to assess the meaning and\nmeasurement of full employment.\nSecond, if monetary policy waits until it is certain that the labor market has fully\nrecovered before beginning to raise rates, policy will be far behind the curve. One risk\nof waiting is that the Committee may be forced to raise rates very quickly to prevent an\nincrease in inflation. In so doing, this may create unnecessary volatility and a rapid\ntightening of financial conditions — either of which could be disruptive to the economy.\nThis would represent a return of the so-called “go-stop” policies of the past. Such\nlanguage was used to describe episodes when the Fed was viewed as providing lots of\naccommodation to stimulate employment and the economy — the go phase — only to\nfind itself forced to apply the brakes abruptly to prevent a rapid uptick in inflation — the\nstop phase. This approach to policy led to more volatility and was more disruptive than\nmany found desirable.\nFor these reasons, I would prefer that we start to raise rates sooner rather than later.\nThis may allow us to increase rates more gradually as the data improve rather than face\nthe prospect of a more abrupt increase in rates to catch up with market forces, which\ncould be the outcome of a prolonged delay in our willingness to act.\n\n9\n\n\fConclusion\nTo summarize, my own forecast is positive. Second-quarter growth has rebounded,\nconfirming that the disappointing performance in the first quarter was mostly weather\nrelated rather than a retrenchment to the ongoing recovery.\nUnemployment continues to improve more quickly than many had expected, and\ninflation appears to be drifting up toward our 2 percent goal.\nIf monetary policy is to be truly data dependent, then our stance of policy must begin to\nchange. I’m not suggesting a rate increase now, but changing the forward guidance\nwould at least afford us the flexibility to gradually raise rates beginning earlier than\ncurrently anticipated.\nWaiting too long to begin raising rates — especially waiting until we have fully met our\ngoals for maximum employment — is risky because we cannot know when we have\narrived. That could also put monetary policy behind the curve and could lead to a\nreturn to abrupt go-stop policies that in the past led to unwelcome volatility.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\n•\n\nPresident Plosser gives his views on the economy and the FOMC’s most recent policy\ndecisions.

You have continued to deliver the great\nprograms and speakers that so many have come to expect from the club. As many of\nyou know, this is the centennial year for the Federal Reserve. In the spirit of such an\nanniversary, my hat goes off to The Economic Club of New York, which has been around\nfor 107 years. What a great and storied history you have, and it is an honor to be here.\nI should note that Congress created our decentralized central bank 100 years ago. That\ndecentralized structure is one of our great strengths, but it requires that I begin with the\nusual disclaimer that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n\n\fIn my remarks this morning, I want to discuss the benefits of rule-like, systematic\nbehavior in the design and conduct of monetary policy. Such behavior, combined with\ngreater transparency, leads to communication that is more effective. This, in turn, helps\nthe public understand the FOMC’s strategies, individual policy decisions, and the likely\npath of policy.\nI will go one step further and illustrate how the FOMC might take a step toward a more\nsystematic policy framework by producing a detailed monetary policy report, similar to\nthose issued by many central banks around the world. One aspect of such a report\ncould highlight the policy paths implied by a few Taylor-like or robust rules and use\nthem as benchmarks to set and communicate policy in a more systematic, rule-like way.\nI will begin with a brief overview of my thoughts about the economy and the FOMC’s\nmost recent policy decisions before I discuss the role that systematic policy can play in\nthe communication of policy.\nThe Economy and the Recent Policy Decision\nFirst, the economy. My overall view of the economy is fairly optimistic. After a first\nquarter buffeted by winter storms, I believe we are poised to grow at a rate somewhat\nabove trend for the remainder of this year and next before reverting back to trend,\nwhich I see as about 2.4 percent. Steady employment growth and healthier household\nbalance sheets will support consumption activity. The current data suggest economic\nstrength is fairly broad based, as evidenced by recent indicators and the optimism\nexpressed by firms in both the manufacturing and service sectors.\nAs for inflation, recent readings have moved a bit higher, mitigating somewhat the\nconcerns that low inflation will persist or decline further. We have ample monetary\naccommodation in the economy to ensure that we will be able to achieve our 2 percent\ntarget over time. It is important, however, that we continue to reinforce our\n2\n\n\fcommitment to that goal so that inflation expectations remain well anchored near our\ntarget.\nAt the meeting last week, the FOMC released its latest Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP). The outlook going forward was largely unchanged. While real GDP\ngrowth for 2014 was marked down, which reflected the disappointing first quarter, the\noutlook for the second half of the year and the projections for 2015 and 2016 were\nunchanged. Unemployment projections were reduced slightly, and the inflation\nforecast remained stable.\nMy own submission for economic growth was generally in line with my colleagues. But\nmy forecast for unemployment was a bit lower in the near term. Specifically, I think the\nunemployment rate may reach 5.8 percent by the end of this year and 5.6 percent by\nthe end of 2015. My view of inflation is that it will stabilize at about 2 percent in 2015.\nSome market participants and commentators have focused on the so-called dot charts\nand the movement of the implied median funds rate for 2014–16. I would remind\neveryone that the dots are not a forecast of what policymakers think the Committee will\nactually do, but they are a reflection of the policymakers’ views of appropriate policy.\nSome have noted that the median path steepened ever so slightly. This should not\ncome as a particular surprise as it likely just reveals greater confidence that the\neconomy is improving. The rebound after the bad winter seems to be progressing, the\noutlook for unemployment is a bit better, and the inflation rate appears to be firming.\nThe changes in the dots thus simply tell us something about individual policymakers\nreaction to the change in economic conditions. The FOMC statement notes that the\nCommittee will adjust future funds rate decisions based on the progress toward our\nobjectives. So, it is entirely reasonable that the expected path of “appropriate policy”\nshould adjust as we close in on those objectives. Indeed, it would be surprising if they\ndid not behave in such a manner.\n3\n\n\fI believe that we are closing in on our goals — perhaps faster than some people might\nthink. So, while I supported the recent policy statement, I have growing concerns that\nwe may have to adjust our communications in the not-too-distant future. Specifically, I\nbelieve the forward guidance in the statement may be too passive, given underlying\neconomic conditions.\nThe Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy\nLet me now turn to the importance of conducting monetary policy in a systematic\nmanner. By systematic policy, I mean conducting policy in a rule-like manner as\nopposed to relying on discretion. Decisions are always made period by period, but in a\nrules-based approach, the decisions are guided by the rules. Discretion is the opposite\nof rules-based decisionmaking. Discretionary decisions are made without being\nconstrained by past promises or previous forward-looking statements.\nThe monetary policy debate over whether rule-like behavior is preferable to pure\ndiscretion dates back at least to Henry Simons in 1936.1 More recently, in their Nobel\nPrize-winning work, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott demonstrated that a credible\ncommitment by policymakers to behave in a systematic rule-like manner leads to better\noutcomes than discretion. 2 Since then, numerous papers using a variety of models have\ninvestigated the benefits of rule-like behavior in monetary policy and found that there\nare indeed significant benefits. Policies characterized by commitment have been shown\nto lead to more economic stability. In fact, the mainstream theoretical models that we\nuse for monetary and macroeconomic analysis are built on the notion that monetary\npolicy is conducted in a rule-like manner.\n\n1\n\nHenry C. Simons, “Rules Versus Authorities in Monetary Policy,” Journal of Political Economy, 44:1\n(February 1936).\n2\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal\nPlans,” Journal of Political Economy, 85 (June 1977), pp. 473–91.\n\n4\n\n\fThe benefits of a rule-like approach arise, in part, because consumers and businesses\nare forward looking. When policymakers credibly commit to a rule-like approach to\nsetting policy, they can alter expectations in ways that make policy more effective and\nless uncertain.\nThe appropriate way to make policy systematic, or rule-like, is to base policy decisions\non the state of the economy. That is, policymakers should describe the reaction\nfunction that determines how the current and future policy rate will be set depending\non economic conditions. Policymakers are, of course, no more certain about future\ncourse of the economy than anyone else is; therefore, they cannot realistically commit\nto particular future values of the policy rate. Nonetheless, describing a reaction\nfunction or rule that explains how the policy rate will be determined in the future as a\nfunction of economic conditions can be highly informative.\nUnfortunately, the science of monetary policy has not progressed to the point where we\ncan specify the optimal rule for setting monetary policy. Given our current state of\nknowledge, judgment is still required in setting policy. One reason is that optimal rules,\nthat is, those that maximize economic welfare, are highly dependent on the particular\nmodel from which they are derived, and there is no broad-based consensus for the right\nmodel. Another factor is that the optimal rule for one model can produce very bad\noutcomes in another model. A third reason is that optimal rules can often be quite\ncomplex, thus making them difficult to implement and to communicate to the public. In\nother words, they may not be very transparent.\nHowever, these limitations to implementing optimal policy rules should not deter us\nfrom efforts to adopt a more systematic, rule-like approach to the conduct of policy.\nIndeed, there has been a great deal of progress made in identifying simple, robust rules\n\n5\n\n\fthat appear to perform well in a variety of models and environments. The most wellknown rule is attributable to John Taylor. 3 The Taylor rule is a reaction function that\nindicates how to set the policy rate as a function of deviations of inflation from the\ninflation target and some measure of economic slack.\nThe attractiveness of Taylor-like rules goes beyond their intuitive appeal or the fact that\nthey seem to describe the actual behavior of monetary policy reasonably well. The\nreality is that Taylor-like rules yield very good results in a variety of theoretical models.\nWhile this is surprising to some, it is of enormous practical importance. Given our\nuncertainty about the true model of the economy, knowing that systematic policy in the\nform of a Taylor-like rule delivers good outcomes in a variety of models means that\nthese simple, robust rules can provide useful guidance for policy. Moreover, rule-like\npolicies also play an important role in central bank communication.\nCommunication\nThe fundamental reason that communication is so important is that monetary policy is\nmore appropriately viewed as the path of the policy rate, not simply the current rate.\nThis is evident today as the markets seem highly attentive to signals regarding the\nfuture path of the funds rate not simply its current setting.\nBecause systematic policy is easily communicated to the public, it also greatly improves\nthe transparency and predictability of monetary policy, which reduces policy surprises.\nBusinesses and consumers are more informed about the course of monetary policy\nbecause they understand how policymakers are likely to react to changing economic\ncircumstances even if they are not certain what those economic conditions might be.\n\n3\n\nJohn B. Taylor, “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy,\nNorth-Holland, 39, 1993, pp. 195–214.\n\n6\n\n\fEqually important in my view is that greater clarity about the policymakers’ reaction\nfunction strengthens accountability. Thus, systematic policy, communicated\ntransparently, strengthens accountability and serves to preserve the central bank’s\nindependence.\nIn this regard, Taylor-like rules have many of these desirable features. They are\nsystematic, based on a limited number of variables, perform well in a variety of models,\nand can therefore provide important guidance for policy decisions. If our policy is\nguided by state-contingent rules, then by reporting our assessment about the evolution\nor forecast of key economic variables, the public will get a better understanding and\nappreciation of the likely path of policy. Indeed, that is likely to be the best information\nwe can provide regarding the future path of policy.\nRules as Benchmarks: A Step Forward\nGiven model uncertainty and data measurement problems, there are, of course,\nlimitations to the use of a simple rule. A robust rule is intended to work well on\naverage, but central banks look at many variables in determining policy. Inevitably,\nthere will be times when economic developments fall outside the scope of our models\nand warrant unusual monetary policy action. Events such as 9/11, the Asian financial\ncrisis, the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the 1987 stock market crash may require\ndepartures from a simple rule.\nHowever, in such unusual circumstances, policymakers will be expected to explain the\ndepartures from the rule. With a rule as a baseline, departures can be quantified and\ninform us how excessively tight or easy policy might be relative to normal. If the events\nare temporary, policymakers will have to explain how and when policy is likely to return\nto normal. Thus, a simple rule provides a valuable benchmark for assessing and\ncommunicating the appropriate stance of policy.\n\n7\n\n\fThe operational question is how might we go about the effort to implement a more\nrules-based policy?\nOne strategy could be to indicate the likely behavior of interest rates based on a few\nTaylor-like rules that have been consistent with the conduct of monetary policy in the\npast or ones that are considered robust across various models. Doing so would require\nagreement on a particular model in order to produce the resulting rule-based behavior.\nFor the Fed, the economic model developed by the Board’s staff seems like a reasonable\nplace to start. Such an exercise could also be enhanced, I believe, by using some of the\ndynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE, models that have been developed\nwithin the Federal Reserve System.\nAs a start, the results of this type of exercise could be published in the FOMC’s current\nbiannual monetary policy report to Congress. Perhaps we might consider releasing\nthese reports on a quarterly basis in keeping with other central banks. The Committee\ncould then indicate whether and why it anticipates policy to be somewhat more\nrestrained or more accommodative relative to the projections given by the various rules.\nThe monetary policy report could also include various views that may differ from the\nbaseline summaries.\nA major benefit of this exercise would be to illustrate the various dimensions of\nuncertainty that policymakers face. Financial markets often prefer certainty about the\nfuture path of monetary policy, but that is unrealistic and not necessarily desirable. For\nexample, this exercise would indicate the extent of model uncertainty, forecast\nuncertainty, and the variations implied by different rules. Many central banks use fan\ncharts and other devices to highlight such bands of uncertainty about the forecast, and\nthe Fed should do the same.\nOverall, this exercise would provide a better sense of the likely direction of policy and\nthe variables most related systematically to that policy. It would also lead the FOMC to\n8\n\n\fdiscuss policy in the context of rules and a systematic approach to decision-making,\nwhich I believe will lead to better decisions and better economic outcomes over the\nlonger run. Moreover, it would require policymakers to explain why they choose to\ndeviate from the benchmarks and the guidelines they provide.\nAn Example\nAs I discussed, communication is an important aspect of monetary policy. I have long\nbeen an advocate of the Fed producing a periodic monetary policy report similar to\nother central banks. It is simply too difficult to convey monetary policy design and\nstrategy within the confines of the brief statements issued at the conclusion of each\nFOMC meeting. Therefore, what I am about to suggest should not be viewed in isolation\nbut as one part of such a periodic report to the public.\nSo, let me illustrate how we might begin to incorporate a more systematic and\ntransparent approach to rule-like decision-making. I view this as one step in a journey,\nnot as the end result.\nMy example uses five simple rules that have been discussed in the literature and\ndescribes their implications for the projected path of the funds rate from now through\n2015. Since these rules are contingent on economic conditions, I will use the midpoint\nof the forecasts derived from the most recent SEP and apply an Okun’s law relationship\nto convert projections of unemployment into projections of economic slack. I should\nimmediately note that this is not a completely coherent exercise as each participant’s\nprojections were based on his or her own view of optimal policy and, as you are well\naware, those views differ. Put differently, the midpoint of the projections arises from an\namalgam of different models and thus represents no one’s forecast or model. Thus, the\nresults are likely to be more diverse than otherwise expected. So my example is purely\nillustrative yet easily replicable. However, given the relevance of the SEP, I thought the\nexercise would be more interesting than if I used an off-the-shelf economic model.\n9\n\n\fThe rules I have chosen are these: first, the original Taylor 1993 rule; second, a variant\nof Taylor’s original rule, sometimes called the Taylor 1999 rule, which places greater\nemphasis on the output gap; third, a version of the Taylor 1999 rule that allows for\nconsiderable interest-rate smoothing and is called the inertial Taylor 1999 rule; fourth, a\nperformance- or outcome-based rule developed by staff at the Philadelphia Fed that is\nsimply an estimated rule that best mimics previous FOMC actions; and fifth, a firstdifference rule that is based on academic work of Athanasios Orphanides and is\ndesigned to take into account the imprecision and uncertainties of our measurements of\nthe level of the output gap or slack and the underlying or steady state real rate of\ninterest.4\nI have plotted the outcome of this exercise in Figure 1. So what can we take away from\nthis picture? First, all the rules suggest that liftoff of the funds rate from the zero bound\nshould occur next quarter. This is considerably sooner than many seem to be expecting.\nSecond, we can also see that although the rules point to policy being tighter, they do\npresent somewhat different profiles of the future path of interest rates. The Taylor 93\nand Taylor 99 rules have a steeper path over the next several quarters than the other\nrules. The primary reason for this is that both of these rules are playing catchup as they\nwould have had liftoff occur earlier. After catchup, they increase more slowly. This\ndispersion in the pace of tightening also reflects model uncertainty. But ignoring or\ndismissing the rules does not avoid the problem such uncertainty poses. Robust rules,\nsuch as the first-difference rule, tend to have better outcomes on average across\nmodels.\n\n4\n\nSee the Appendix for the precise mathematical formulations of each of these rules and the relevant\nreferences.\n\n10\n\n\fThird, we see that three of the policy paths are not that different from each other.\nTaylor 93, Taylor 99, and the performance based rules tend to converge to between 2.5\nand 3.0 percent by mid-2015 and remain close thereafter.\nMy own assessment of appropriate policy is similar to that described by the firstdifference rule. However, my point is not to decide which path is correct, but to\nillustrate how such benchmarks can be useful for communications.\nFor example, the exercise might suggest that policy choices that fall outside the bounds\nof these rules should be viewed with some caution. That does not mean they would be\nwrong but they would require careful and substantial discussion and justification.\nEven for policy choices that might fall within the bounds, the exercise can provide\nmeaning, quantitative and qualitative, to phrases such as rates are expected to be\n“lower than normal.”\nAnother way of highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the future path of policy is to\nconsider different paths for the economy. Consider Figure 2. Here I employ the first\ndifference rule but consider the implications of a stronger and a weaker path for the\neconomy. To illustrate the range of policy paths that could ensue, I use three different\nforecasts, the midpoint forecast from the SEP, as in the previous chart, as well as two\nhypothetical forecasts. The first takes a combination of the lowest inflation and highest\nunemployment forecasts (a weak forecast), and the second does just the opposite by\ncombining the highest inflation and lowest unemployment forecasts (a strong forecast).\nOf course, neither represents a particular forecast or model; they combine various\nelements of different forecasts. Thus, the exercise represents a fairly extreme\nconstruction of forecast uncertainty. In any event, we observe a wide range for the\npredicted funds rate paths as in the first experiment. The weakest forecast anticipates a\nfunds rate of nearly 1 percent by the end of 2015, while the strongest forecast envisions\na funds rate of about 4.7 percent in part because both inflation and unemployment\n11\n\n\f“overshoot” their long-run and sustainable values and corrections must follow. Note,\nhowever, that even the weakest economic view coupled with the first-difference rule\nhas the funds rate rising above the zero lower bound next quarter. This picture is\nanalogous, but not in a precise way, to a fan chart.\nI have indicated throughout my talk the imprecision of our knowledge about the\neconomy. My understanding is no more precise than the understanding of colleagues\nor private-sector economists. These two exercises highlight the model and forecast\nuncertainty policymakers face. Rather than trying to target particular future values of\nthe policy rate, a monetary policy report under a rules-based approach could convey the\nuncertainty and still assure that decisions will be driven by the state of the economy.\nThese two exercises indicate a need to explain more fully why policy is deviating from\nwhat is suggested by these rules.\nNo doubt, there is a variety of views on this issue, but I think the policy process itself\nand our communication of policy would benefit greatly from producing a detailed\nmonetary policy report with some of the features I have discussed today.\n\n12\n\n\f13\n\n\fAppendix\nTaylor 1993\n\n𝑎𝑣𝑔\n\n𝑖𝑡 = 𝑅 ∗ + 𝜋𝑡\n\n𝑎𝑣𝑔\n\n+ 0.5�𝜋𝑡\n\n− 2� + 0.5(𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡∗ )\n\nTaylor, John B. “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference\nSeries on Public Policy, vol. 39 (December 1993), pp. 195–214.\n(http://web.stanford.edu/~johntayl/Papers/Discretion.PDF)\n\nTaylor 1999\n\n𝑎𝑣𝑔\n\n𝑖𝑡 = 𝑅 ∗ + 𝜋𝑡\n\n𝑎𝑣𝑔\n\n+ 0.5�𝜋𝑡\n\n− 2� + (𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡∗ )\n\nTaylor, John B. “A Historical Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules,” in John B.

Rules-based policy is a topic that I have discussed\nnumerous times in the past few years, urging policymakers to seek a more systematic approach\nto policymaking. I am particularly honored to be on a panel with my colleague John Williams,\nwhose research in this area has been an important influence on my views, as well as Tom\nSargent. In Tom’s case, there probably isn’t an economist in this room who hasn’t been\n1\n\n\finfluenced by his work and his contributions to economics. But before I go any further, I should\nbegin with the usual disclaimer that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nThe Theoretical Justification for Rules\nThe theory part of this session’s title is well established. In their Nobel Prize-winning work, Finn\nKydland and Ed Prescott demonstrated that a credible commitment by policymakers to behave\nin a systematic, rule-like manner over time leads to better outcomes than discretion. 1 Since\nthen, numerous papers using a variety of models have investigated the benefits of rule-like\nbehavior in monetary policy and found that there are indeed significant benefits. 2 Policies\ncharacterized by commitment have been shown to lead to more economic stability — lower\nand less volatile inflation and less volatile output. In fact, the mainstream theoretical models\nthat we use for monetary and macroeconomic analysis are built on the notion that monetary\npolicy is conducted in a rule-like manner.\nThe Practice\nThe practice part of the session title has proven to be a bit more elusive. The science of\nmonetary policy has not progressed to the point where we can specify the optimal rule for\nsetting monetary policy. The reason is that optimal rules, that is, those that maximize\neconomic welfare, are highly dependent on the particular model from which they are derived,\nand there is no broad-based consensus for the right model. More relevant is the finding that\nthe optimal rule for one model can produce very bad outcomes in another model. In addition,\noptimal rules can often be quite complex, thus making them difficult to implement and to\ncommunicate to the public. In other words, they may not be very transparent.\n\n1\n\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,”\nJournal of Political Economy, 85 (June 1977), pp. 473–91.\n\n2\n\nFor an excellent overview, see Richard Clarida, Jordi Gali, and Mark Gertler, “The Science of Monetary Policy,”\nJournal of Economic Literature (December 1999), pp. 1661–1707.\n\n2\n\n\fHowever, these limitations to implementing optimal policy rules should not deter us from\nefforts to adopt a more systematic rule-like approach to the conduct of policy. There has been\na great deal of progress made in identifying simple rules that appear to perform well in a\nvariety of models and environments. Such robust rules can form a basis for developing more\nsystematic, rule-like policymaking.\nOne important and desirable characteristic of a systematic and rule-like approach to policy\nrelates to communication. In particular, it is an approach that is easily communicated to the\npublic and thus greatly improves the transparency and predictability of monetary policy, which\nreduces surprises. The public and markets are more informed about the course of monetary\npolicy because they understand how policymakers are likely to react to changing economic\ncircumstances. Equally important in my view is that greater clarity about the policymakers’\nreaction function strengthens accountability and thus can serve to preserve the central bank’s\nindependence.\nThe most well-known simple rule, of course, is the one proposed by John Taylor in 1993.3 The\nTaylor rule and the family of rules it has inspired call for setting the nominal fed funds rate\nbased on three factors: the economy’s long-run real interest rate plus the Fed’s target rate of\ninflation, the deviation of inflation from the central bank’s target, and the departure of real\nGDP from some measure of “potential” GDP. The rule implies, for example, that when inflation\nis above target, the funds rate should increase by more than one-for-one with the deviation,\nand when GDP is below “potential,” the funds rate should be reduced.\nThe attractiveness of Taylor-like rules for monetary policy goes beyond their intuitive appeal or\nthe fact that they seem to describe the actual behavior of monetary policy reasonably well.\nTaylor-like rules tend to fall in the class of those rules that are robust. That is, they yield good\n3\n\nJohn B. Taylor, “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Series on Public Policy, NorthHolland, 39, 1993, pp. 195–214.\n\n3\n\n\fresults in a variety of theoretical settings. This feature is of enormous practical importance.\nGiven our uncertainty about the true model of the economy, knowing that systematic policy in\nthe form of a Taylor-like rule delivers good outcomes in a variety of models means that simple,\nrobust rules can provide useful guidance for policy.\nGiven model uncertainty and data measurement problems, there are, of course, limitations to\nthe use of a simple rule. The rule is basically intended to work well on average, but central\nbanks look at many variables in determining policy. There inevitably will be times when\neconomic developments fall outside the scope of our models and warrant unusual monetary\npolicy action. Events such as 9/11, the Asian financial crisis, the collapse of Lehman Brothers,\nand the 1987 stock market crash may require departures from a simple rule. Having articulated\na rule guiding policymaking in normal times, however, policymakers will be expected to explain\nthe departures from the rule in these unusual circumstances. With a rule as a baseline,\ndepartures can be quantified and inform us how excessively tight or easy policy might be\nrelative to normal. If the events are temporary, policymakers will have to explain how and\nwhen policy is likely to return to normal. Thus, a simple rule provides a valuable benchmark for\nassessing the appropriate stance of policy. That makes it a useful tool to enhance effective\ncommunication and transparency.\nRules and Forward Guidance\nIn addition to providing important guidance for current policy decisions, Taylor-like rules can\nalso be extremely useful in providing guidance for the expected future path of policy. Such\nforward guidance has received a good deal of attention recently. One reason for this increased\nattention is that short-term rates have been constrained by the zero lower bound. Thus,\nforward guidance and communication regarding future policy decisions take on greater\nsignificance.\nHowever, forward guidance is not a separate or independent policy tool. Its effectiveness is\nintimately related to other features of monetary policy. Monetary policy should be thought of\n4\n\n\fmore holistically, if you will. How effective we are with forward guidance, for example, can only\nbe assessed or thought of in the context of a central bank’s overall approach to policy, including\nits approach to communication and transparency.\nIn particular, I see a credible, rule-like approach to policy and the general openness and\ntransparency of the policy process as essential elements in shaping expectations. Indeed, a\ncommitment to a policy framework that is systematic and rule-like provides the foundation for\nestablishing expectations concerning the future path of policy and thus forward guidance.\nRules as Benchmarks: A Step Forward\nSo from my perspective, using Taylor-like rules to shape current and expected future policy is\nan important and useful part of any monetary policy framework. The operational question is\nhow might one go about such an effort? This is not a trivial assignment. As I mentioned at the\noutset, it has proved to be quite elusive.\nIn a stylized world, where there is a single monetary policymaker who has considerable\nconfidence in a model of the economy, communication would include a forecast derived from\nthis model. This forecast would incorporate a policy path that yields the best economic\noutcomes based on that single policymaker’s views.\nUnfortunately, we don’t live in such a world. Monetary policymaking is often conducted by\ncommittee, and divergent views can and often do exist. While this can be clumsy at times, such\ngovernance mechanisms ensure that various views are heard in an environment that promotes\nbetter decisions and better outcomes.\nNevertheless, I believe that given the nature of U.S. institutional arrangements, Taylor-like rules\ncan serve a very useful purpose. Specifically, they could underpin the construction of a periodic\ndetailed monetary policy report, a feature of communication that has been adopted by many\n\n5\n\n\fcentral banks around the world. However, while these reports have many similarities, there are\nsome key differences.\nMany central banks include detailed forecasts in their published reports and highlight risks\nalong with the outlook. This communication about the evolution of key economic variables\nthat shape policy is important, but there is still debate about the nature of the forecasts and\nthe assumptions that underlie them.\nA critical piece of a forecast emanating from the central bank is the nature of the future path of\nthe policy rate. Should a central bank’s published forecast be based on its assessment of what\nthe policy rate path is likely to be, perhaps based on its reaction function, or should the forecast\nbe based on an interest rate path that is more arbitrary, such as a constant interest rate path or\none that is related to market expectations?\nAn alternative approach that could easily be adopted would be to indicate the likely behavior of\ninterest rates based on a few different Taylor-like rules that have been consistent with the\nconduct of monetary policy in the past or ones that are considered robust across various\nmodels of the economy. Doing so would require agreement on a particular model in order to\nproduce the resulting rule-based behavior. For the Fed, the economic model developed by the\nBoard’s staff, called FRB/US, seems like a reasonable place to start. Such an exercise could also\nbe enhanced, I believe, by using some of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE,\nmodels that have been developed within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe FOMC could then use its biannual monetary policy reports to communicate the results and\nwhether and why it anticipates policy to be somewhat more restrained or more\naccommodative relative to the projections given by the various rules. The monetary policy\nreport could also include various views that may differ from the baseline summaries. Policy\nstatements between reports can refer back to the reports to provide consistency in the\nCommittee’s communications with the public.\n6\n\n\fPerforming this exercise would illustrate the various dimensions of uncertainty that\npolicymakers face. For example, there is model uncertainty, forecast uncertainty, and the\nvariations implied by different rules. Many central banks use fan charts and other devices to\nhighlight such bands of uncertainty about the forecast, and the Fed should do the same. It\nwould provide a better sense of the likely direction of policy and the variables most related\nsystematically to that policy. Further, this type of communication would push the FOMC to\nconduct policy in a more systematic manner, which I believe will lead to better economic\noutcomes over the longer run.\nConclusions\nI am fully aware that we need to take great care in providing more specific forms of forward\nguidance so that we avoid a false sense of certainty and a mistaken sense of commitment. Yet,\nI believe systematic rule-like monetary policymaking can enhance economic performance, and\ntherefore, I favor clearer communication concerning the formulation of policy.\nProviding information about how the policy path is likely to evolve forces policymakers to think\nmore deeply and more systematically about policy. Communication about that path, in turn,\ngives the public a much deeper understanding of the analytical approach that guides monetary\npolicy.\n\n7\n\n\f"

I would also like to thank Professor Maury Obstfeld for suggesting a number of\ninteresting topics for us to consider. He has highlighted some issues that I believe are\nintimately related to one another: namely, the central bank’s ability to influence expectations\nthrough forward guidance, the role of quantitative easing, and the process of exiting from that\neasing. Indeed, I think it is important that we think about monetary policy more holistically, if\nyou will. How effective we are with forward guidance or quantitative easing can only be\nassessed in the broader context of a central bank’s overall approach to policy, including its\n1\n\n\fapproach to communication and transparency.\nHowever, before I go any further, I should begin with the usual disclaimer that my views are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nI want to focus my remarks today on communication and transparency in the conduct of\nmonetary policy. One major reason for this emphasis is the recognition that the stance of\nmonetary policy encompasses not just the current level of the short-term policy rate but its\nexpected future path as well. Economists have come to understand that expectations about\nmonetary policy can play an important role in determining economic outcomes, such as real\neconomic growth and inflation. For example, today’s decision to save or to spend is influenced\nby the current interest rate as well as tomorrow’s expected future consumption. In turn,\ntomorrow’s expected future consumption is influenced by next period’s interest rate and next\nperiod’s expected future consumption. Therefore, the entire expected path of interest rates,\nnot just the current interest rate, influences today’s consumption. This is not only true for\npersonal consumption, but also business investment decisions, and the setting of prices and\nwages.\nAn element of communication that has received a good deal of attention is forward guidance.\nForward guidance relates to the communication about the future course of monetary policy,\nboth the likely path of the short-term policy rate as well as path of balance sheet actions\nassociated with quantitative easing.\nOf course, one reason for this increased focus on future policy actions is that the current shortterm policy rate conveys little information, as it has been constrained by the zero lower bound.\nThus, forward guidance in the U.S. has evolved to include information about the future pace\nand duration of asset purchases, as well as under what conditions, and how quickly, the policy\nrate might eventually lift off from the zero lower bound.\n2\n\n\fHowever, forward guidance is not a separate or independent tool of policy. Its effectiveness is\nintimately related to other features of monetary policy. For example, a credible, systematic\napproach to policy and the general openness and transparency of the policy process are\nessential elements in shaping expectations and thus must be considered when formulating\nforward guidance. For forward guidance to be successful, it must be credible. And it is difficult\nto make it credible if it is inconsistent with other features of the policy framework.\nOne of the most important ways to support credibility and thus the effectiveness of forward\nguidance is to practice it as part of a systematic policy framework. I believe that indicating how\nthe evolution of key economic variables systematically shapes current and future policy\ndecisions is critical to such a policy framework. Indeed, a commitment to a policy framework\nthat is systematic and rule-like provides the foundation for establishing expectations for the\nfuture path of policy and thus forward guidance.\nIf We Only Had a Reaction Function\nThe appropriate way to make policy systematic and rule-like is to make policy history\ndependent and base policy decisions on the state of the economy. Doing so does not commit\nthe policymakers to particular future values of the policy rate, but describing a reaction\nfunction explains how the policy rate will be determined by economic conditions.\nUnfortunately, the science of monetary policy has not reached the point where we can specify\na precise or optimal rule for setting policy. That would require an agreed-upon model of the\neconomy — something we don’t have yet. Nevertheless, I believe systematic policy can be\nguided by various forms of robust rules, such as the one proposed by John Taylor — with which\nwe are all familiar.\nThe attractiveness of Taylor-like rules for monetary policy goes beyond their intuitive appeal or\nthe fact that they seem to describe the actual behavior of monetary policy reasonably well. The\n3\n\n\freality is that Taylor-like rules yield very good results in a variety of theoretical settings. This\nfeature of the rules is of enormous practical importance. Given our uncertainty about the true\nmodel of the economy, knowing that systematic policy in the form of a Taylor-like rule delivers\ngood outcomes in a variety of models means that these simple rules can provide useful\nguidance for policy.\nSystematic policies that provide important information about the policymakers’ reaction\nfunction combined with other information, such as the policymakers’ economic forecasts, can\nsharpen forward guidance in ways that reduce policy uncertainty and enhance economic\nperformance. Thus, well-designed communications are valuable, and behaving systematically\nhas the added advantage of making those communications easier for the public to understand.\nBalance Sheet Policies\nI have focused my discussion on forward guidance with respect to the setting of the policy rate,\nbut these principles apply equally to balance sheet policies. There is room to debate how\neffective balance sheet policies, such as quantitative easing, have been, and indeed, just how\nthey affect interest rates and economic activity. Some think balance sheet policies work\nthrough portfolio balance effects that alter risk premia. The quantitative effects on\nmacroeconomic outcomes, however, are unclear. And the theoretical underpinnings for this\nchannel depend on the model and the assumptions made regarding the extent of financial\nmarket frictions and the degree and form of market segmentation.\nOthers believe that quantitative easing acts through the potential signaling effects associated\nwith large changes in the balance sheet. Namely, adding to the balance sheet could signal a\nmore accommodative future policy, which lowers longer-term nominal and real interest rates,\nand thereby spurs current economic activity, including expected inflation. Of course, if the\npolicies and communications regarding the future path of the policy rate were transparent and\nfully credible, such signaling would not be necessary. Moreover, if signaling is the primary\nchannel through which large-scale asset purchases act, there remains much that we don’t\n4\n\n\funderstand about how to calibrate such operations. In any event, it will be important that the\nsignals conveyed by balance sheet policies are consistent with the forward guidance about\nfuture interest rate policies. This has been a difficult communications challenge at times for the\nFOMC. And it will likely remain a communications challenge as the Committee coordinates the\nunwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet with the gradual increase in the policy rate.\nImplementing Forward Guidance\nI have indicated conceptually why a systematic approach to communications is important but\nhave yet to discuss how a central bank might implement such an approach. This issue has\nreceived increased attention in recent years, with various central banks adopting different\nstrategies. The differences are based on alternative economic viewpoints as well as on varying\ninstitutional structures. I think the Fed can learn a great deal from the various approaches.\nMany of you in this room are very knowledgeable, and have thought deeply about the costs\nand benefits of the various approaches.\nA forecast is, of course, a critical piece of information emanating from the central bank, and the\nnature of the policy rate’s future path is an important element of that forecast. These forecasts\nare often presented and discussed by central banks in the form of published inflation or\nmonetary policy reports. Such reports can and should be an important element of a central\nbank’s communication and transparency about the policy process. But a number of interesting\nquestions arise. Should a central bank’s published forecast be based on its assessment of what\nthe policy rate path is likely to be, or should the forecast be based on an interest rate path that\nis more arbitrary, such as a constant interest rate path or one that is related to market\nexpectations?\nI am fully aware that great care needs to be taken in providing more specific forms of forward\nguidance. We must avoid a false sense of certainty regarding future policy or a mistaken sense\nof commitment to a specific path of policy rates. Yet, I believe there are approaches, like the\none I am about to suggest, that can avoid or mitigate these pitfalls. Because I believe\n5\n\n\fsystematic monetary policymaking can enhance economic performance, I am in favor of clearer\ncommunication concerning the formulation of policy.\nNow, in our stylized models, there tends to be a single monetary policymaker who knows the\nstructure of the economy. Therefore, the approach for communication would be a forecast\nderived from the policymaker’s model as well as a policy path that yields the best economic\noutcomes based on that model of the economy.\nUnfortunately, we don’t live in such a world. Monetary policymaking is often conducted by\ncommittee, and divergent views can and often do exist. While this can be clumsy at times, such\ngovernance mechanisms ensure that various views are heard. This promotes better decisions\nand outcomes and helps preserve central bank independence and accountability.\nThus, it may be difficult for a large committee like the FOMC to achieve a consensus forecast or\npolicy path. Yet, we can enhance our communication by indicating the likely behavior of\ninterest rates based on a few different Taylor-like rules that have been consistent with the\nconduct of monetary policy. Doing so would require agreement on a particular model in order\nto produce the resulting rule-based behavior. For the Fed, the economic model called FRB/US,\nwhich was developed by the Board’s staff, seems like a reasonable place to start. Such an\nexercise could also be enhanced, I believe, by using some of the dynamic stochastic general\nequilibrium, or DSGE, models that have been developed within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe FOMC could then articulate whether and why it anticipates policy to be somewhat more\nrestrained or more accommodative, relative to the projections given by the rules. The current\nmonetary policy report that the Fed delivers each February and July could be adapted to\ninclude those exercises as well as a discussion of the opinions of Committee members regarding\nthe results.\nIt is important that in performing this exercise we illustrate the various dimensions of\n6\n\n\funcertainty that policymakers face. For example, there is model uncertainty, forecast\nuncertainty, and the variations implied by different rules. Many central banks use fan charts\nand other devices to highlight such uncertainty, and we, the Fed, would be wise to do the same.\nEven acknowledging the uncertainty, the exercise will provide a better sense of the likely\ndirection of policy and the variables most related systematically to that policy.\nI believe these steps toward greater transparency and communication would be significant\nprogress, and would encourage the FOMC to conduct policy in a more systematic manner. I\nbelieve this would lead to better economic outcomes over the longer run.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Women in Housing & Finance meetings have\nfeatured a number of Federal Reserve policymakers in recent years. A review of their\nspeeches traces an arc through the turmoil in the U.S. housing market, which led to the\nworst financial crisis and economic downturn since World War II, the regulatory reform\nthat followed, and the moderate but steady recovery over the past five years.\nIn January 2008, then-Chairman Ben Bernanke addressed your group a month after the\nGreat Recession began, following sharp and dramatic declines in the U.S. housing\n1\n\n\fmarket during 2007. Then, in June 2009, former Governor Elizabeth Duke described the\nactions that the Federal Reserve had taken to contain the financial crisis and promote\neconomic recovery. In February 2011, former Kansas City Fed President Tom Hoenig\nasked whether the Dodd-Frank Act would actually improve the financial regulatory\nclimate and solve the yet-unresolved issue of too-big-to-fail institutions.\nToday, I am delighted to join you at a time when, despite the effects of the severe\nwinter weather, the economy is on the firmest footing it has been on since the recovery\nbegan. But this does not mean that we are likely to see, nor should we seek to see, a\nreturn to the unsustainable levels of residential real estate activity that preceded the\nfinancial crisis. That did not end well.\nInstead, the perspective I will offer today is one of sustainable improvement in housing\nin the context of a broader economic recovery. Then, I will close with some thoughts on\nmonetary policy. Before I continue, though, I will note that my views are my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic Conditions\nSo, let me begin with an overview of the U.S. economy. We are almost five years into a\nrecovery that began in June 2009. Growth accelerated in the second half of 2013 but\nfaced some stiff winter headwinds in the first quarter of this year. Yet, I think most of us\nnow view this as a temporary weather-related slowdown and not a risk to the\nunderlying recovery.\nSnowstorms and frigid temperatures affected every aspect of the economy, from sales\nand hours worked to logistics and supply chains during the first quarter of the year. You\ncan’t sell a house if buyers can’t get in the front door. You can’t sell a car if it is buried in\nsnow. And even if your factory is producing goods, you can’t deliver them to your\ncustomers as scheduled if trucks can’t navigate the highways or if trains have to slow\n\n2\n\n\fdown to half their normal speed. My own view is that it will take another month or two\nbefore we can hope to see a somewhat clearer picture of the economy.\nThe first estimate of GDP growth for the first quarter of 2014 showed that the overall\neconomy was essentially flat, expanding at an annualized rate of just 0.1 percent. The\nunderlying details are more encouraging. Consumer spending increased 3 percent,\nmarking the 19th consecutive quarter of growth. This growth is supported by the fact\nthat households have reduced their debt and strengthened their balance sheets over\nthe past few years. And as the values of equities and real estate have risen, consumer\nsavings rates have fallen and consumption spending has increased.\nThe weakness in the overall GDP figure comes predominately from lackluster\ninvestment, both by businesses and homebuilders, as well as some pullback in exports\nand imports.\nOur business contacts as well as our surveys confirm that economic activity was greatly\nhampered by the winter weather in the Northeast and in other parts of the country.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers in our region has been\na reliable indicator of national manufacturing trends in the U.S. The survey results\nindicate that manufacturing activity has been expanding for 11 of the past 12 months.\nThe only aberration was in February 2014, when respondents ascribed their declines to\nthe severe weather. But the survey has since indicated positive growth in March, April,\nand May. The ISM manufacturing index, which measures nationwide activity, similarly\ndropped in the winter months and has since bounced back.\nThus, I continue to believe that the U.S. economy is on a firmer footing today than it has\nbeen in several years. This is a cause for some optimism for continued progress in 2014.\nMy forecast has been for growth of about 3 percent in 2014, and while the weatherrelated softness in the first quarter may temper this full-year outlook somewhat, it\nhasn’t led me to downgrade my outlook for the remainder of the year.\n\n3\n\n\fOne of the most encouraging signs for the economy comes from the labor market,\nbelieve it or not. Employers added 288,000 jobs in April, the strongest gain since\nJanuary 2012, and job growth in February and March were revised upward by a total of\n36,000. The gains in April were broad-based across sectors, including 32,000 net new\njobs in construction. Indeed, net job growth has exceeded 200,000 in five of the past\nseven months, with only the frozen months of December and January showing\ndisappointing numbers. Even if we include those weak months, the economy has added\nmore than 200,000 jobs per month on average over the past seven months.\nThe unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent in April, down more than a full\npercentage point from a year ago and the lowest rate recorded in more than five years.\nThis month’s decline was particularly sharp and was driven, in part, by a decline in labor\nforce participation. I would note that the household survey, which gives us the\nunemployment rate, is more volatile than the establishment survey, which measures\nthe number of new jobs added. I would not be surprised if the unemployment rate\nmoved up a bit next month, but the downward trend continues, and we are making\nsignificant improvement. The number of those unemployed for more than 27 weeks\ndropped by 287,000 in April, and by 1.25 million since January 2013. While this is an\nimprovement in labor markets, everyone will readily agree that the long-term\nunemployed remain a serious concern.\nI expect that the unemployment rate will fall below 6.2 by the end of 2014. If anything,\nthis forecast may prove to be too pessimistic. Given the recent trends, an\nunemployment rate below 6 percent is certainly plausible.\nInflation remains benign. It is running somewhat below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2\npercent. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year change in the\nprice index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. That figure came\nin at 1.2 percent last year and is running at about the same pace over the first two\nmonths of this year. It is important to defend our 2 percent inflation target both from\nbelow and above. Yet, I anticipate, as the FOMC indicated in its most recent statement,\n4\n\n\fthat inflation will move back toward our target over time. Indeed, we learned last week\nthat the CPI moved up in April and is now running at 2 percent over the past year and at\na 2.3 percent annual rate during the past three months.\nI am encouraged that inflation expectations remain near their longer-term averages and\nconsistent with our 2 percent target. Given the large amount of monetary\naccommodation that we have added and continue to add to the economy, I think there\nis some upside risk to inflation in the longer term.\nThere are risks with respect to my growth forecast as well. While there continues to be\nsome downside risk to growth, for the first time in years, I see the potential for more\nupside risk to the economic outlook. So as the economy gradually moves toward our 2\npercent inflation target and the labor market continues to improve, we will need to\ncalibrate monetary policy to reflect the improvements.\nConstruction and Housing Markets\nLet me offer some further observations on the housing market. Residential real estate is\na focus of many economists because it was ground zero for the financial crisis and the\nensuing Great Recession.\nIn the past, we tended to see housing lead the economy out of the recession, but for a\nnumber of reasons, that was not the case this time.\nAs we know, sales of existing homes plummeted from unsustainable peaks during the\nhousing boom. Sales bottomed out at an annual rate of 3.5 million houses in July 2010\nand then climbed steadily for three years to 5.4 million in July 2013. That was about the\nsame annual rate that we averaged in the years preceding the boom. Sales have fallen\nsomewhat since mid-2013, due in part to rising mortgage rates, but those rates remain\nlow by historical standards. The fundamentals of the housing market remain sound,\nincluding stronger household formation, solid job growth, and consumers with stronger\nbalance sheets.\n5\n\n\fHome prices are well below their peaks, but they continue to improve as the market\nrecovers. Two national measures were up recently: The S&P Case Shiller Home Price\nIndex was up 12.8 percent year over year in its latest February number, and the\nCoreLogic National House Price Index was up 11.1 percent in March.\nSome have expressed concern over the housing recovery in recent months, but I am\nmore optimistic. As I said, the fundamentals remain sound, and even though sales have\nleveled off recently, prices have continued to rise even over the past three months.\nThat suggests that supply may be restricting sales more than weaker demand. But we\nwill have to wait and see how the remainder of the spring and summer plays out.\nThe structure of housing finance in our country remains a topic of intense discussion as\nit was before, during, and after the crisis. As I have argued in the past, the governmentsponsored enterprises, or GSEs, were permitted to operate for private profit but with an\nimplicit guarantee from the government, and so they were able to take extraordinary\nrisk at the taxpayers’ expense. 1 This was a classic case of moral hazard, and it must not\nbe repeated.\nThere are many proposals for a new system of housing finance with varying levels of\ngovernment support. There is no clear or easy answer to the degree of government\ninvolvement in the housing market; that is a decision we must make as a nation,\ncarefully weighing the benefits of homeownership with the costs of the misallocation of\nscarce capital and the risks of unintended consequences.\nThe U.S. subsidizes homeownership, more than any other developed country. We do so\nby providing an interest deduction for home mortgages and by underwriting housing\ndebt through an explicit taxpayer support for the GSEs, which is reflected in mortgage\nrates. There are debates about the quantitative effects of these subsidies. But we\nshould not be afraid to ask hard questions. Most financial advisors would tell you to\n1\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Some Observations About Policy Lessons from the Crisis,” remarks at the Philadelphia\nFed Policy Forum, Philadelphia, PA, December 4, 2009.\n\n6\n\n\fdiversify your asset holdings, yet our housing policies incentivize families to do just the\nopposite: put your savings in your home. The policies encourage homeownership over\nother asset classes. The results for many families were devastating.\nThe GSEs were at the center of the housing storm and we have to date not addressed\nthe fundamental reforms required. However, if as a nation we choose to continue the\nsubsidies to homeownership, the government involvement and subsidies must be\nexplicit, transparent, and well understood. Burying those subsidies in complex financial\narrangements or in new semigovernment enterprises will be counterproductive.\nMarkets work best when the risks and rewards of decisions are clearly defined so that\nprices can accurately reflect each transaction and the appropriate risk monitoring takes\nplace.\nMonetary Policy\nSo let me turn to some issues for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve lowered its\npolicy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially zero more than five years ago.\nSince the policy rate cannot go any lower, the Fed has attempted to provide additional\naccommodation through large-scale asset purchases. We are now in our third round of\nthis quantitative easing.\nSince September 2012, the FOMC has added about $1.4 trillion in long-term Treasuries\nand mortgage-backed securities to its balance sheet through this program, known as\nQE3. It is already twice the size of the last round of asset purchases, known as QE2.\nIn December 2013, the Committee announced that it would reduce the pace of\npurchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per month. It announced another $10 billion\nreduction in January, March, and April and is now purchasing $45 billion a month. If the\nFOMC continues this path of measured reductions, the purchase program will end\nsometime this fall. If the economy continues to improve, though, we could find\nourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an environment in which history\nsuggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the opposite direction.\n7\n\n\fIn addition to asset purchases, the Fed is using forward guidance to try and inform the\npublic about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. In the March and\nApril statements, the FOMC reaffirmed its highly accommodative stance. The statement\nused qualitative language to describe the economic conditions that would lead to\naction. The Committee reported that it will look at a wide range of information,\nincluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and\ninflation expectations, and readings on financial developments, to assess progress —\nboth realized and expected — toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2\npercent inflation.\nThe FOMC also noted, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be\nappropriate to keep its target federal funds rate near zero for a considerable time after\nthe asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run\nbelow the 2 percent goal and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nMy own view is that, as we continue to move closer to our 2 percent inflation goal and\nthe labor market improves, we must be prepared to adjust policy appropriately. That\nmay well require us to begin raising interest rates sooner rather than later.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve at a moderate\npace. We are likely to see growth return to around 3 percent through the rest of 2014.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment\nrate will continue to decline, reaching 6.2 percent or lower by the end of 2014. I also\nbelieve that inflation expectations will be relatively stable and that inflation will move\nup toward our goal of 2 percent over the next year.\nI expect the housing and construction sectors will continue to recover. But we should\nnot seek to return to the heady days of last decade’s real estate boom.\nOn monetary policy, reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving\nin the right direction, but the pace may leave us behind the curve if the economy\n8\n\n\fcontinues to play out according to FOMC forecasts.\nEven after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary policy will still be highly\naccommodative. As the expansion gains traction, the challenge will be to reduce\naccommodation and to normalize policy in a way that ensures that inflation remains\nclose to our target, that the economy continues to grow, and that we avoid sowing the\nseeds of another financial crisis.\nLet me conclude with this thought. Over the past five years, the Fed and, dare I say,\nmany other central banks have become much more interventionist. I do not think this is\na particularly healthy state of affairs for central banks or our economies. The crisis in\nthe U.S. has long passed. With a growing economy and the Fed’s long-term asset\npurchases coming to an end, now is the time to contemplate restoring some semblance\nof normalcy to monetary policy.\nIn my view, the proper role for monetary policy is to work behind the scenes in limited\nand systematic ways to promote price stability and long-term growth. Since the onset\nof the financial crisis, central banks have become highly interventionist in their efforts to\nmanipulate asset prices and financial markets in general as they attempt to fine-tune\neconomic outcomes. This approach has continued well past the end of the financial\ncrisis. While the motivations may be noble, we have created an environment in which\n“it is all about the Fed.” Market participants focus entirely too much on how the central\nbank may tweak its policy, and central bankers have become too sensitive and desirous\nof managing prices in the financial world. I do not see this as a healthy symbiotic\nrelationship for the long term.\nIf financial market participants believe that their success depends primarily on the next\ndecisions of monetary policymakers rather than on economic fundamentals, our capital\nmarkets will not deliver the economic benefits they are capable of providing. And if\ncentral banks do not limit their interventionist strategies and focus on returning to more\nnormal policymaking aimed at promoting price stability and long-term growth, then\n9\n\n\fthey will simply encourage the financial markets to ignore fundamentals and to focus\ninstead on the next actions of the central bank.\nI hope we can find a way to make monetary policy decision-making less interventionist,\nless discretionary, and more systematic. I believe our longer-term economic health will\nbe the beneficiary.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fWelcoming Remarks\nReinventing Older Communities: Bridging Growth & Opportunity\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMay 12, 2014\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHighlights\n• President Charles Plosser welcomes participants to the 2014 Reinventing Older Communities\nbiennial conference.\n• President Plosser highlights emerging trends in the labor market, demographics, and educational\nsystem and discusses how understanding them can help prepare communities for growth and\nprosperity.\n• President Plosser says it is important to think about how we can continue to upgrade the skills and\nproductivity of young people and the workforce more broadly to successfully reinvent our\ncommunities.\n\nIntroduction\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the Reinventing Older Communities conference. This is the\nsixth biennial conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. It has grown to\nbecome an important event for the Federal Reserve System as we bring together a rich and\ndiverse mix of stakeholders who are interested in understanding the interaction between older\nindustrial communities and the broader economy.\nThe Federal Reserve System, which is marking its centennial year, is a decentralized central\nbank, with 12 individual Reserve Banks throughout the country that are overseen by a Board of\nGovernors in Washington, D.C. As Theresa Singleton mentioned, we are delighted that seven of\nthose Federal Reserve Banks are partnering with us to sponsor this year’s conference. I thank\nthem and the other sponsors who have helped us create what promises to be an outstanding\nevent.\n1\n\n\fI also want to thank you for taking the time to join us for this conference. Your participation\nhere and your ongoing work in communities around the nation demonstrate your commitment\nto bridge growth and opportunity. In that way, we can reinvent our communities to ensure they\nare places where people can lead fulfilling and successful lives. But this work requires a creative\nforward-looking approach.\nMaybe it’s the fact that the Stanley Cup playoffs are still going on in mid-May, but I’m reminded\nthat Wayne Gretzky was once asked about his success in hockey. The Great One responded by\nsaying, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.” He scored many\ngoals with this strategy, and I believe his philosophy can be helpful in many disciplines. For\nexample, I have talked about the need for monetary policy to be forward looking. But I believe\nthis approach also applies to the revitalization of older communities.\nNow, I am by no means a community development expert or a hockey player. During my\nlifetime, I have lived in several older communities, including Rochester, NY, and Birmingham,\nAL, where I was born. I attended college in Nashville, TN, and graduate school in Chicago. I have\nlived and worked in New York City, as well as in and around Los Altos, CA, near the heart of\nSilicon Valley, and for almost eight years now, I have lived here in Philadelphia.\nIt occurs to me that often older communities seek to turn back the clock to restore their past\nglories. A variation is to chase the puck. But in so doing, they find themselves perpetually in the\npast, never quite catching up and usually falling further behind. These are unlikely to be\nsuccessful strategies. It is appropriate to learn from the past. But trying to restore the past is\nnot a strategy for success. As most of you are aware, rebuilding and revitalizing our older cities\nis not about the past but our ability to seize the future.\nThe Philadelphia of tomorrow will not the Philadelphia of the past, nor should it be. There are\nmany opportunities for productive transitions and improvements. Indeed, we should seek to\n2\n\n\fexploit the latest innovations to make Philadelphia, like many of our postindustrial cities\nrepresented here today, wonderful places to live, work, and play. We have to acknowledge that\nour world has changed, and it continues to change at a very rapid pace. Embracing that change\nin order to reinvent the future of our cities is hard work, but it can pay off handsomely.\nThe extent to which we are able to see where emerging trends are headed — where the puck\nwill be, if you will — gives us the chance to take advantage of the opportunities they present.\nThat will allow our communities to be more successful and more effective.\nI want to spend the remainder of my brief time discussing a few emerging issues for you to\nconsider over the next few days, as you participate in the conference workshops and plenary\nsessions.\nEmerging Trends\nMy comments will focus on the labor market and the importance it plays in shaping the future\nof our nation, but more relevant for this group, how it is shaping the future of our cities. The\nfinancial crisis and Great Recession led to severe dislocations in many sectors of our economy,\nincluding the housing sector, financial markets, and the labor market. Monetary and fiscal\nauthorities responded in myriad ways to help the economy and our nation recover. But we\nshould resist the temptation to implement programs with the goal of recreating the past.\nThe unemployment rate has slowly recovered and is now 6.3 percent from its peak of 10\npercent in October 2009. Some are skeptical, though, because the decline in the\nunemployment rate reflects not only increases in employment but declines in labor force\nparticipation. Many interpret such declines in the participation rate as representing\ndiscouraged workers who have stopped looking for work. Yet, labor force participation rates\ncan also decline for demographic reasons. Indeed, we have seen steadily declining participation\nrates since 2000, and we can account for about three-quarters of this decline in participation\n\n3\n\n\fsince the start of the recession in December 2007 because of increased retirements and\nmovements into disability.\nDemographic trends, driven largely by an aging baby boomer generation, are altering the age\ndistribution of our population. More specifically, we are getting older, and the size of the\nworking age population is shrinking relative to those over 65. It is widely recognized that this\nfundamental shift will require major changes in the structure of Social Security and Medicare\nprograms.\nYet even as we solve such fiscal challenges associated with an aging population, we have to face\nup to the changing skills that employers are seeking. We are seeing a mismatch of skills in the\nworkforce and the jobs that are being created. Many employers I have spoken to around the\ncountry talk about the fact that while they are hiring new workers, they are hiring a new type of\nworker: a worker who is more technologically sophisticated and productive. Going forward our\neducational system needs to be upgraded to prepare young people for this changing labor\nmarket. We are simply not keeping pace.\nMore specifically, business leaders I have met talk repeatedly about having trouble finding\nqualified candidates in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math, or so-called\nSTEM jobs. As you know, the increasing needs for STEM-trained workers is one of the trends\nthat will drive labor demand and productivity growth in our future. The Department of\nCommerce estimates that STEM employment grew at three times the rate of non-STEM\nemployment in the previous decade and is projected to grow at twice the rate of non-STEM\njobs through 2018.\nSadly, we are not doing an adequate job of preparing our workforce for these jobs.\nManufacturing is one sector in which firms have implemented new production technologies\nand are in need of STEM workers. The Philadelphia Fed’s April Business Outlook Survey of\nmanufacturers included a special question about the factors influencing their decisions to\n4\n\n\fremain in the region. Respondents identified the availability of skilled labor as the most\nimportant factor. They also ranked the availability of skilled labor as becoming a more\nimportant factor in recent years.\nThese concerns highlight the importance of our educational system in equipping our young\npeople with the skills necessary to improve their own lives and improve the communities in\nwhich they live and work. Better wages accrue to a more productive employee. Firms will not\nlocate in communities where they cannot find workers with the right skills and work ethic. For\nour older communities, successful revitalization will mean seeing to it that the workforce is up\nto the task.\nThe standard of living in our nation as well as our communities is inextricably tied to the\nproductivity of our workforce. As we look to the future, we have to think about how we can\ncontinue to upgrade the skills and productivity of young people and the workforce more\nbroadly. If we are to successfully reinvent our communities, we must focus on preparing our\nworkforce for the future.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by reminding you that the theme of this year’s conference is Bridging Growth\nand Opportunity. And I can think of no better bridge to opportunity than education. Education\nis a bridge for our young people and a bridge for our local economies. As someone who has\nspent over three decades in the teaching profession, I firmly believe that education is one of\nour most important investments. It is critical for the long-term health and prosperity of our\nnation. Education expands opportunity, leads to more innovation, and enhances productivity. In\nthe end, this leads to better economic outcomes.\nI am excited that this year’s conference will highlight the critical role that education and\nworkforce development play in reinventing older communities. We are honored to host a Sit\nDown with the Superintendents, a panel session that will give you an opportunity to engage in a\n5\n\n\fdialogue with school superintendents from several older industrial cities. This is your chance to\ndiscuss how community development and educational leaders can work together to connect\npeople with the right skills to the jobs ahead. This is another example in which those of you\nwho think about workforce development can get ahead of the puck. And score a goal for all\nolder communities.\nThe work that you do — building these bridges to opportunity — is about creating a better\nfuture for all of us who live in these special places. It will not be easy, and there is no quick fix,\nbut it will be one of the most important things we can do. Thank you for participating in our\nprogram this year.\n\n6\n\n\f"

It’s a pleasure to return to the Council on Foreign\nRelations. I know that the value of these sessions often arises during the discussion, so I will try\nto keep my opening remarks brief. Before I go any further, though, I should begin with the usual\ndisclaimer that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nThe topic I want to address today is communication and transparency in the conduct of\nmonetary policy. Some of you can recall when it was taken for granted that the central bank\nwas supposed to be secretive and mysterious. The guiding principle was simple: The less said\nabout monetary policy, the better. Indeed, it was not until 1994 that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) began to announce policy changes made at its meetings.\n\n1\n\n\fBut times have changed. Transparency has replaced secrecy, and open communication has\nreplaced mystery. The extent of this transformation is, in many ways, remarkable. Today, the\nissues of communication and transparency are front and center on the agenda of many\nmeetings and conferences on central banking. A major reason for the focus on these issues is\nthe recognition that the stance of monetary policy encompasses not just the current level of\nthe short-term policy rate but its expected future path as well. More broadly, economists have\ncome to understand that expectations, including expectations about monetary policy, play an\nimportant role in determining economic outcomes, such as real economic growth and inflation.\nOne element of communication that has received a good deal of attention is forward guidance.\nForward guidance is central bankers’ speak for communication about the future course of\nmonetary policy, and particularly about the likely path of the short-term policy rate. One reason\nfor this increased attention on the future path of policy is that short-term rates have been\nconstrained by the zero lower bound. So when, or under what conditions, the nominal policy\nrate might eventually rise takes on greater significance.\nHowever, forward guidance is not a separate or independent tool of policy. Its effectiveness is\nintimately related to other features of monetary policy. In particular, a credible, systematic\napproach to policy and the general openness and transparency of the policy process are\nessential elements in shaping expectations. Even with this recognition, there are various views\nabout how best to communicate information about the intended path of policy and how to\nensure that such information is credible. If it is not credible, then it will not shape expectations\nin a beneficial way.\nMore generally, a central bank can and often does communicate on a host of important issues,\nincluding its view of the current state of the economy, its assessment of risks, and its outlook\nfor key economic variables. Perhaps most important, from my perspective, is communication\nabout how the evolution of key economic variables systematically shapes current and future\npolicy decisions.\n2\n\n\fIn my remarks this morning, I want to stress the importance of the FOMC articulating such a\nsystematic approach to policy. Doing so is likely to make forward guidance more effective, by\nhelping the public to better interpret what that guidance means.\nThe Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy\nSo what do I mean by a systematic approach to policy? Quite simply, I mean conducting policy\nin a more rule-like manner. The antithesis of such rule-like behavior, of course, is discretion;\nthat is, policymaking conducted period by period with great latitude to take whatever actions\nseem best at the time.\n\nThe rules-versus-discretion debate in economics is an old one, dating back at least to Henry\nSimons in 1936.1 Yet, following the Nobel Prize-winning work of Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott in\n1977, most academic economists — but, unfortunately, far fewer policymakers — have come to\naccept the benefits of adhering to rule-like behavior in monetary policy. 2 These benefits arise,\nin part, because consumers and businesses are forward looking, and credible commitments\nconcerning the determinants of the future path of policy can alter expectations in ways that\nmake policy more effective and less uncertain. The ability to behave systematically and to align\nthe public’s expectations with that systematic behavior can allow the central bank to increase\ncurrent economic activity, while simultaneously lowering inflation. But a credible commitment\nto honor past promises is an essential element of rule-like policy. Discretionary decision-making\nundermines such commitments.\n\nThe appropriate way to make policy systematic, or rule-like, is to base policy decisions on the\nstate of the economy. That is, policymakers should describe the reaction function that\ndetermines how the current and future policy rate will be set depending on the state of the\n1\n\nHenry C. Simons, “Rules versus Authorities in Monetary Policy,” Journal of Political Economy, 44:1 (January 1936).\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,”\nJournal of Political Economy, 85 (June 1977), pp. 473–91.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\feconomy. Policymakers are, of course, no more certain about future economic conditions than\nanyone else is, and therefore cannot realistically commit to particular future values of the\npolicy rate. Nonetheless, describing a reaction function or rule that explains how the policy rate\nwill be determined in the future as a function of economic conditions can be highly informative.\nUnfortunately, the science of monetary policy has not reached the point where we can specify\na rule for setting policy and turn decision-making over to a computer. Judgment is still required.\nNevertheless, I place a great deal of importance on systematic behavior both as prescription for\ngood policy and in terms of my own policy deliberations.\n\nMuch study has been done on various rules, but the most well-known rule is attributable to\nJohn Taylor.3 The Taylor rule is a reaction function that indicates how to set the policy rate as a\nfunction of deviations of inflation from the inflation target and some measure of economic\nslack.\nThe attractiveness of Taylor-like rules for monetary policy goes beyond their intuitive appeal or\nthe fact that they seem to describe the actual behavior of monetary policy reasonably well. The\nreality is that Taylor-like rules yield very good results in a variety of theoretical settings. While\nthis is surprising to some, it is of enormous practical importance. Given our uncertainty about\nthe true model of the economy, knowing that systematic policy in the form of a Taylor-like rule\ndelivers good outcomes in a variety of models means that these simple, robust rules can\nprovide useful guidance for policy.\n\nSystematic policies that provide important information about the policymakers’ reaction\nfunction combined with other information, such as the policymakers’ economic forecasts, can\nsharpen forward guidance in a way that reduces policy uncertainty and enhances economic\nperformance. Thus, well-designed communications are valuable, and behaving systematically\n3\n\nJohn B. Taylor, “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Series on Public Policy, NorthHolland, 39, 1993, pp. 195–214.\n\n4\n\n\fhas the added advantage of making those communications easier for the public to understand.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\nBut what else should the central bank convey? For example, should it publish forecasts of\nvariables in its policy reaction function and should these forecasts be based on the most likely\npath that the policy rate will follow or on some other assumption?\n\nWhile many central banks publish forecasts in detailed inflation or monetary policy reports,\nthere is still debate about the nature of the forecasts and the assumptions that underlie them.\nFor example, who owns the forecast? At some central banks, the forecast is that of the policy\ncommittee and thus represents a type of consensus forecast. In other cases, the forecast is that\nof the central bank staff. Individual policymakers who do not fully buy into the forecast are then\nfree to express their own independent views about the outlook.\nA critical piece of a forecast emanating from the central bank is the nature of the future path of\nthe policy rate. Should a central bank’s published forecast be based on its assessment of what\nthe policy rate path is likely to be, perhaps based on its reaction function, a so-called\nunconditional forecast? Or should the forecast be based on an interest rate path that is more\narbitrary, such as a constant interest rate path or one that is related to market expectations\ninferred from forward interest rates. Others question whether the central bank should reveal\nthe forecast’s assumed interest rate path at all.\n\nPerhaps the greatest fear preventing most central banks from publishing the best assessment\nof its future interest rate path is that the public will assume the projections will be taken as a\ncommitment to that path rather than a projection influenced by the evolution of the economy.\nIn my view, such fears could be mitigated if policymakers would articulate the way they\nsystematically expect to adjust policy in response to changes in economic conditions.\nWhile I have suggested potential problems if the central bank publishes its assessment of the\n5\n\n\flikely near-term path of policy rates, in conjunction with its economic forecast, there is also a\nmajor benefit; namely, the added discipline that it places on the policy process itself. As I\nalluded to in my introduction, monetary policy does not just affect the economy through the\ncurrent setting of the interest rate, but also through the expected path that the policy rate will\ntake over time. Providing information about how that path is likely to evolve forces\npolicymakers to think more deeply and systematically about policy. Communication about that\npath, in turn, gives the public a much deeper understanding of the analytical approach that\nguides monetary policy. Again, my view is that policy transparency and forward guidance could\nbe enhanced if the central bank was more explicit in articulating its systematic approach to\npolicy.\n\nConclusions and Going Forward\nI am fully aware that great care needs to be taken in providing more specific forms of forward\nguidance so that we avoid a false sense of certainty and a mistaken sense of commitment. Yet I\nbelieve systematic monetary policymaking can enhance economic performance, and therefore I\nfavor clearer communication concerning the formulation of policy.\nIn a stylized world, where there is a single monetary policymaker who has considerable\nconfidence in a model of the economy, effective communication would include a forecast\nderived from this model. This forecast would incorporate a policy path that yields the best\neconomic outcomes based on that single policymaker’s views.\nHowever, we don’t live in such a simple world. Monetary policymaking is often conducted by\ncommittee, and divergent views can and often do exist. While this can be clumsy at times, such\ngovernance mechanisms have great strength in preventing institutions from lapsing into\ngroupthink by ensuring that various views are heard in an environment that promotes better\ndecisions and outcomes and helps to preserve central bank independence and accountability.\nThus, it may be difficult for the FOMC to achieve a consensus forecast or policy path. One way\n6\n\n\fto enhance its communication would be to indicate the likely behavior of interest rates based\non a few different Taylor-like rules that have been consistent with the conduct of monetary\npolicy. Doing so would require agreement on a particular model in order to produce the\nresulting rule-based behavior. For the Fed, the Board staff’s economic model, called FRB/US,\nseems like a reasonable place to start. The FOMC could then articulate whether and why it\nanticipates policy to be somewhat more restrained or more accommodative relative to the\nprojections given by the rules. A monetary policy report that might accompany such a forecast\ncould include various views that may differ from the baseline summaries.\nPerforming this exercise would indicate the inherent uncertainty that policymakers face, yet it\nwould also provide a better sense of the likely direction of policy and the variables most related\nsystematically to that policy. Further, this type of communication would push the FOMC to\nconduct policy in a more systematic manner, which I believe will lead to better economic\noutcomes over the longer run.\n\n7\n\n\f"

We are very\npleased to partner with the Wharton School and the Journal of Financial Services Research in\nthis joint conference on “Enhancing Prudential Standards in Financial Regulations.” I want to\nacknowledge and thank the organizers for assembling such a distinguished group of academics\nand practitioners to discuss the ongoing efforts to improve our financial system.\n\nI am going to take advantage of my role as host to offer some of my own thoughts on financial\nregulations and financial stability. I will present a high-level perspective of the subject. I don’t\nplan to let the messy details get in the way of lofty thoughts. Instead, I believe it is helpful to\nstep back from the complicated details of financial regulation to think more broadly about the\ngoals and objectives of reform and the strategies that might best get us there. Of course, these\nviews are my own and should not be interpreted as representing the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\n\fI think we all agree that financial markets and intermediaries play an important economic role\nby pooling funds from savers and investors and allocating these resources to their most\nproductive uses. Such allocations require financial intermediaries to assess and price various\nrisky claims. They then can sell some of the risks, either duration or credit risk, to investors and\nothers who are willing to bear that risk. Thus, intermediaries help allocate resources and risks\nthroughout the economy, thereby improving efficiency and productivity.\n\nAt times, however, financial intermediation can result in risks becoming concentrated in ways\nthat increase rather than reduce the fragility of the financial system more broadly. This is what\nmany people mean when they refer to systemic risk. While today I will use the term in this\nfashion, I would note that the concept is quite vague. One of the major difficulties we face in\nmanaging systemic risk is defining what it is and how to measure it. Ideally, one important goal\nof financial supervision and regulation is to monitor risk in the financial system and reduce the\nchances that it inadvertently leads to financial fragility or instability. Regulation, however,\nshould seek to do so without impeding the healthy functioning of financial markets and\ninstitutions.\n\nIn response to the financial crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act in 2010, which included enhanced capital and liquidity standards and\nrisk-management requirements for large financial institutions thought to be systemically\nimportant.\n\nIn addition to new regulations, the crisis brought about important changes in supervision.\nSupervisors are taking a macroprudential approach to their responsibilities. Rather than\nfocusing on the risk in a single institution, supervisors are spending more time analyzing risks\nacross firms. Large financial firms are now required to have stronger data and information\nsystems so they can better monitor and manage their own risks. And these firms are required\nto report higher quality data to supervisors. The Federal Reserve now utilizes these data as well\n\n2\n\n\fas other information it receives to conduct more in-depth and timely assessments of emerging\nrisks. Access to better data has also enabled supervisors to conduct the supervisory stress tests\nrequired by Dodd-Frank, which assess the ability of these large institutions to withstand a\nsevere economic downturn.\n\nThis conference will address the efficacy of many of these individual elements of Dodd-Frank\nand of supervisory reforms, which are still evolving nearly four years after the legislation was\nfirst enacted. For the remainder of my remarks, I wish to explore three broad principles that I\nbelieve we need to consider as we search for ways to improve the stability of our financial\nsystem. The first is simplicity. Our regulatory framework is becoming increasingly complex,\nwhich has led to rising compliance costs as well as enforcement costs. The second principle is\ntransparency. Financial markets and instruments have also become increasingly complex and in\nsome cases occasionally opaque. Ensuring that financial instruments and firms are sufficiently\ntransparent can contribute to greater efficiency and awareness of risks exposures. The third\nprinciple I will stress is the role that market forces can play in effectively controlling risk-taking\nand enhancing supervision.\n\nSimplicity\nLet me begin with simplicity. The financial world has become very complex and so has financial\nregulation. It is easy to claim that complex regulation is necessitated by the increasing\ncomplexity of the financial markets. After all, regulations are, in part, shaped by evolving\nmarket structures. In some cases, new regulations arise in response to a crisis or a perceived\nfailure of some kind. Unfortunately, markets often evolve faster than the regulations; detailed\nrule writing that underlies much of the complex regulation can become obsolete, which then\nrequires more rule writing.\n\nYet, we should consider that causality can work both ways. Regulations themselves give rise to\nincentives to evade the rules. Such regulatory arbitrage can result in increasingly complex\nfinancial structures designed to fall outside existing rules. This activity then begets more\n\n3\n\n\fcomplex rules that markets once again seek to avoid. Consider the increasing complexity and\ngranularity of the Basel risk-weighting classifications. The logic of assessing capital\nrequirements based on the risk of an institution’s assets is sensible in principle; however, it\ncreates incentives for institutions to structure assets in ways that minimize the use of capital,\nperhaps resulting in risks that become hidden in opaque or complex structures that are not\naddressed by specific rules or classifications found in the Basel framework.\n\nSuch a cycle of increasing complexity raises both compliance costs and enforcement costs.\nThus, I believe, there is merit in developing simpler, more transparent regulatory solutions\ndesigned to work reasonably well in a wide range of situations. For example, higher capital\nrequirements based on the leverage ratio, as opposed to overly complex risk-weighting\nschemes, might lower both compliance and enforcement costs while achieving similar or better\noutcomes in terms of the safety and soundness of individual institutions as well as overall\nfinancial stability.\n\nMoreover, there are examples of how market participants’ reactions to regulation may have\ncontributed to the recent financial crisis. For instance, the expansion of the shadow banking\nsystem was in many ways a result of attempts to circumvent regulations placed on banking\ninstitutions. Similarly, the use of bond ratings in setting bank capital requirements for securities\nholdings or in making eligible certain structured products for various investment purposes\ncreated incentives to inflate ratings of collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, and other\nstructured products backed by subprime mortgages. Consider bankruptcy rules that exempt\novernight swaps and repurchase agreements from the traditional stays when a company files\nfor bankruptcy. Such rules reduce the incentive for lenders to monitor counterparty risk and\nthus effectively lower the relative cost of using short-term funding to finance an intermediary’s\nor investment firm’s balance sheet. As we know, the reliance on short-term funding from\nsources totally immune from counterparty risk can contribute to increasing risks of contagion\nand runs on financial institutions.\n\n4\n\n\fIncreased regulatory complexity can make consistent enforcement of the rules more difficult.\nInconsistent enforcement can make it harder for financial institutions to predict how regulators\nare likely to behave. Such uncertainty can make the financial system less efficient and can\nundermine the credibility of the regulatory regime, thereby making the regime less effective in\nfostering financial stability. In contrast, simple regulations are easier for financial firms to\nfollow, increase the likelihood that supervisors will consistently enforce them, and are\ntherefore more likely to have the desired effect.\n\nTransparency\nNext, let me turn to transparency. Economists for the most part think transparency is a good\nthing, and I am no exception. I will talk about transparency from two perspectives. The first is\ntransparency regarding financial institutions and financial products. The second is transparency\nby regulators.\n\nAs is true of financial regulations, financial instruments have become increasingly complex,\nwhether due to market demands or incentives created by regulation. Whatever the reason, it is\nentirely appropriate to require adequate disclosure and transparency regarding the structure\nand risk of both the instruments and the institutions. Such transparency allows markets to\nbetter price the inherent risks of the securities and the firms. So put me in the camp of more\ndisclosure and transparency.\n\nBut just as markets can use information on securities and firms to improve market prices and\nassess risk exposures, markets are also likely to find value in regulatory information. As a bank\nregulator, the Federal Reserve gets a detailed view of how large financial institutions measure\nand manage risk. Banks and supervisors now use a host of sophisticated models and\ntechniques to assess risks.\n\nThere has been a long debate about the potential costs and benefits of releasing some\nregulatory information once treated as confidential. Many policymakers now believe that\n\n5\n\n\fpublic disclosure of additional information concerning the financial condition, risk exposures,\nand supervisory assessments of firms would be beneficial to financial stability. Greater\ntransparency would enable market participants to better assess the risks of counterparties and\nthereby exert more effective market discipline.\n\nIncreased transparency about supervisory practices would also allow financial firms to have\ngreater confidence about the “rules of the road.” This would reduce regulatory uncertainty and\nthe inefficiencies of regulatory arbitrage as firms try to guess what’s on the minds of regulators.\nWhen firms have a better understanding of regulatory requirements, they can appropriately\nevaluate the economic costs and benefits of their decisions.\n\nOf course, there are concerns that too much transparency can have unintended consequences.\nThe added information could lead to instability by creating runs on financial institutions if\nmarket participants misunderstand or overreact to negative news. Increased transparency\nmight reduce the quality and quantity of information that financial firms would share with\nregulators. While these concerns may be legitimate, I would argue that revealing more\ninformation about individual firms will reduce the likelihood of contagion and runs, as such\nevents generally arise from a lack of information, rather than too much information, about the\nriskiness of an individual firm.\n\nMarket Discipline\nThe final principle I would like to stress is the role of market discipline. I believe that market\ndiscipline can be a powerful tool in controlling the risk-taking of financial institutions. Notice\nthat transparency is an important ingredient in effective market discipline, since a more\ninformed market is likely to function more efficiently and set the prices of securities and firms\nmore accurately.\n\nAs we seek to improve and strengthen financial stability, we should think about mechanisms to\nmake market forces more effective, not just write rules that attempt to substitute for market\n\n6\n\n\fforces. Creating incentives for markets to monitor and price risk-taking by financial institutions,\nrather than have markets simply assume that regulators have monitored the risk for them, is a\ndesirable outcome. A complex and nontransparent regulatory regime can create its own form\nof moral hazard. Thus, efforts to enhance the effectiveness of market discipline are beneficial\nas they reduce the necessity of rules and interventions that can create perverse or unintended\nconsequences and the potential for moral hazard.\n\nAs one example of how regulation could harness market forces to promote financial stability,\nsome have proposed that financial institutions be required to issue subordinated debt. Owners\nof subordinated debt have a strong incentive to monitor risk-taking by these firms, as they are\nlast in line in the event of failure. Others and I have argued for contingent debt that would\nconvert to capital, in response to specific market triggers indicating that the firm was under\nstress. Such automatic recapitalization would help prevent firms from failing in the first place.\nManagers would have a strong incentive to avoid taking on risks that might lead to such events,\nas they would dramatically dilute existing shareholders.\n\nAnother way markets can aid supervision is through the information they can provide to\nsupervisors. Markets aggregate many risk assessments into a single measure, such as the price\nor quantity traded of a security. These market measures can be compared across institutions to\nprovide an indication of relative risk. The measures can also be monitored over time to provide\nindications of changes in risk. Market participants have strong financial incentives to correctly\nprice a firm’s risk. Since market prices of securities tend to be forward-looking, they reflect\ninvestors’ expectations given the current information.\n\nThere are several examples of how market signals could be incorporated into the regulatory\nprocess. For instance, if financial firms were required to issue subordinated debt, as I have just\ndiscussed, supervisors could monitor a bank’s subordinated debt spreads for indications of\nemerging risk and take appropriate actions in response. This strategy is supported by evidence\nthat subordinated debt spreads do increase with the risk profile of the issuers.\n\n7\n\n\fOthers have argued for using credit default swap spreads or market-based capital measures in\nthe supervisory process. In particular, the Federal Reserve has proposed using market signals in\nestablishing thresholds for “early remediation” under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThe argument for greater use of market data in bank supervision is not that market signals are\nalways superior to supervisory assessments, but that market data can complement information\ngathered by examiners. There is still much to learn about how best to combine market data\nwith examiner data to improve supervisory assessments of risk in the financial system, and\nadditional research in this area could prove highly useful.\n\nOf course, if we want to effectively leverage market discipline, then we have to address the\nproblem of too big to fail. If creditors perceive they will be rescued, then market discipline is\nundermined and moral hazard will lead to greater risk-taking by the institutions. It is important\nto recognize that the moral hazard problem is not mitigated by eliminating the potential for\ngovernment support. It doesn’t matter where the money comes from to rescue creditors. Any\nmeans of providing an implicit or explicit subsidy to protect creditors undermines market\ndiscipline and creates moral hazard. Without an effective and credible resolution regime that\nensures no subsidies to creditors, there is less incentive for markets to monitor a firm’s risk –\nthus, the firm’s risk would not be accurately reflected in security prices.\n\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the existing authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) to resolve failing banks including those that are deemed systemically\nimportant. While the objective is to end too big to fail, I have argued that the reforms as\ncurrently envisioned are unlikely to do so. The expansive discretionary power given to the FDIC\nunder Title II could make it vulnerable to political pressure regarding the bailout of individual\ninstitutions or creditors. Keep in mind that Title II resolution is triggered only when there are\nconcerns about systemic risks. The discretionary aspect of Title II could cause creditors to\nperceive that their payoffs would be determined through a regulatory resolution process, in\n\n8\n\n\fwhich political pressure can be brought to bear, independent of the rule of law. Some have\nsuggested that there be a tax on the financial industry to provide support for the resolution\nscheme proposed by the FDIC. While this may get the taxpayer off the hook, it does not solve\nthe too-big-to-fail problem.\n\nOn a number of occasions, I have advocated a new bankruptcy mechanism suitable for all\nfinancial firms, whether systemically important or not, to alleviate most of the potential\nproblems caused by the discretionary and targeted nature of Title II.1 A bankruptcy process\ntailored for financial institutions would restore the incentives of market participants and\ncreditors, in particular, to monitor risk taking by these institutions. I find this a more appealing\nand effective path to ending too big to fail.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, simplicity and transparency are important principles to enhance prudential\nstandards in financial regulations and financial stability. Simple, transparent regulatory\nmechanisms make it easier for market participants to predict how regulators are likely to\nbehave. This, in turn, makes it easier for regulators to credibly commit to implementing the\nregulations in a consistent manner, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the regulatory\nregime.\n\nAn increased role for simple regulatory mechanisms that are harder to evade – and even better,\nmechanisms that utilize market forces to discipline firm behavior – is superior to an everexpanding list of complex rules that seeks to cover every possible outcome. In many\ncircumstances, simpler and more transparent regulatory approaches, that also enhance the\neffectiveness of market discipline, can better achieve financial stability while maintaining a\ndynamic financial system that meets the needs of our economy.\n\n1\n\nSee Charles Plosser, “Reducing Financial Fragility by Ending Too Big to Fail,” speech before the Eighth Annual\nFinance Conference, Boston College Carroll School of Management , Boston, MA, June 6, 2013.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Your series of guest speakers over the years has been quite illustrious, and it has\nincluded many Federal Reserve governors and presidents, not to mention distinguished\neconomists and a wide array of others. So, before I share some thoughts on monetary policy\nwith you tonight, I will begin with the usual disclaimer that my views are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC). Of course, that disclaimer is a two-way street, and you should not\nnecessarily associate the views of my colleagues with my views.\n\n1\n\n\fI believe that this diversity of views among FOMC participants does more than assure variety\namong your guest speakers. It is one of the great strengths of our decentralized central bank.\nOpen dialogue and diversity of views leads to better policy decisions and is the primary means\nby which new ideas are gradually incorporated into our monetary policy framework. Thus, I\nbelieve diversity of thought is a sign of thoughtful progress. As I noted in 2009 when I last\nspoke to you, the famous American journalist Walter Lippmann once said, “Where all men think\nalike, no one thinks very much.”\nTonight I would like to focus on a particular aspect of current monetary policy that has been a\nsource of much discussion and debate – forward guidance – that is, the practice of providing\ninformation on the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. Forward guidance has\ntaken on greater significance since the FOMC lowered the target federal funds rate to\nessentially zero more than five years ago. Facing this zero lower bound constraint on its\nprimary policy instrument, the FOMC has been attempting to implement monetary policy, in\npart, by influencing expectations of future policy. The logic for this approach derives from the\nimportant role expectations play in shaping economic outcomes. If monetary policy can affect\nthose expectations in specific ways, it can influence current economic conditions.\nThe approach I want to take in my discussion is to highlight the relationship between such\nforward guidance and systematic monetary policy. By systematic, I mean setting policy in a\nrule-like or largely predictable manner in response to changes in economic conditions. Forward\nguidance and systematic monetary policy are closely related. Understanding this relationship\ncan provide insights into effective monetary policy in both normal times and in more unusual or\nextreme circumstances, such as when policy is constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal\ninterest rates.\nSo, I will begin with a brief review of the benefits of systematic policy. I will highlight why I\nthink most academic economists have concluded that conducting monetary policy in a rule-like\nmanner is preferable to regimes that are more discretionary.\n2\n\n\fSystematic Policy\nFor someone my age, it doesn’t seem all that long ago when it was taken for granted that\ncentral banking was supposed to be mysterious and secretive — the less said about monetary\npolicy the better. Indeed, it wasn’t until 1994 that the FOMC began to publicly announce the\npolicy changes made at an FOMC meeting. Up until then, the markets were left to infer the\npolicy action from the Fed’s behavior in the market. 1\nBut times have most definitely changed. Transparency has replaced secrecy, and open\ncommunications have replaced mystery. While there are those who long for those thrilling\ndays of yesteryear when central bankers said little and communicated even less, I don’t think\nwe can turn back the clock — nor should we.\nEconomic science has come a long way in the past 30 years, and one of the most important\ndevelopments has been the recognition of the important role that expectations play in\nunderstanding economic outcomes. This is particularly evident in financial markets, where\ninvestment decisions and the valuation of securities depend on assessments of future economic\noutcomes. But this is also true for individuals buying homes and businesses making capital\ninvestments.\nWhen businesses and households have a better understanding of how monetary policy is likely\nto evolve, they can make more informed spending and financial decisions. If policymakers can\nreduce uncertainty about the course of monetary policy, the economy is likely to perform more\nefficiently. Thus, monetary policy that is more systematic and predictable can reduce\nexpectational errors and contribute to a more stable and efficiently functioning economy. This\nrecognition of the important role played by expectations has led many academics and\npolicymakers to stress the importance of credibility and commitment to well-articulated\nmonetary policy objectives. It has also led to extensive research on monetary policy rules that\ncan enhance the predictability of policy. In fact, virtually all of the mainstream macroeconomic\n1\n\nSee the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, “Timeline to Transparency,” www.philadelphiafed.org/about-thefed/transparency/ (accessed March 22, 2014).\n\n3\n\n\fmodels are built upon the presumption that monetary policy is conducted in a rule-like manner\nthat is well understood by all agents in the economy.\nIn their Nobel Prize-winning work, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott demonstrated that a credible\ncommitment by policymakers to behave in a systematic, rule-like manner over time leads to\nbetter outcomes than discretion.2 In monetary policy, less discretionary behavior and a\ncommitment to a more systematic approach have been shown to lead to more economic\nstability – lower and less volatile inflation and less volatile output.\nYet, the science of monetary policy has not progressed to the point where we can specify the\noptimal rule for setting monetary policy and turn decisions over to a computer. Judgment is\nstill required. Moreover, optimal rules, that is, those that maximize economic welfare, are\nhighly dependent on the particular model from which they are derived. For example, the\noptimal rule for one model can produce very bad outcomes in another model. In addition,\noptimal rules can often be quite complex, thus making them difficult to implement and to\ncommunicate to the public. In other words, they may not be very transparent.\nHowever, these limitations to implementing optimal policy rules should not prevent us from\nadopting a systematic approach to the conduct of policy. There has been a great deal of\nprogress in identifying simple, robust rules that appear to perform well in a variety of models\nand environments. Such robust rules can form a basis for developing more systematic, rule-like\npolicymaking. This rule-like approach does not mean one can know the future or what future\npolicy decisions will be. You often hear policymakers speak of policy as being data dependent,\nand indeed, it is. But the data should feed into a systematic decision-making process so that\npolicy will be similar in similar environments. One way to think about this systematic part of\npolicy is as a reaction function with parameters that are largely stable over time.\n\n2\n\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,”\nJournal of Political Economy, 85 (January 1977), pp. 473–91.\n\n4\n\n\fOne important and desirable characteristic of such a reaction function is that it can be easily\narticulated to the public. This greatly improves the transparency and predictability of monetary\npolicy, which reduces surprises. Everyone is more informed about the course of monetary\npolicy because they understand how policymakers are likely to react to changing economic\ncircumstances.\nThe most well-known simple rule is that proposed by John Taylor in 1993.3 The Taylor rule calls\nfor setting the nominal fed funds rate based on three factors. The first represents the\neconomy’s long-run real interest rate, perhaps the steady-state real interest rate, plus the Fed’s\ntarget rate of inflation. This is sometimes referred to as the normal, or neutral, nominal rate of\ninterest.\nThe second factor is a function of the deviation of inflation from the central bank’s target or\ngoal. If inflation is above the target, the Taylor rule says the funds rate should be higher, and if\nit is below target, the funds rate should be lower. The third element in the Taylor rule calls for\nan adjustment of the funds rate to departures of real GDP from some measure of “potential”\nGDP. Simply put, when GDP is below “potential,” the funds rate should be reduced, and when\nit is above, it should increase.\nI will point out that our recent thresholds did not provide a reaction function. They simply\nsuggested a range of economic conditions under which we would not act. They conveyed\nnothing about our actions in other states of the economy. In my view, this was one of the\nmajor drawbacks to the approach and the reason changes were needed.\nOver the past 20 years, the Taylor rule has garnered a great deal of attention and study. Many\nvariations have been proposed and their properties investigated. Almost all the simple rules\nthat have been found to be robust over a range of models have very similar constructions and\ncan be expressed as variants of Taylor’s original specification. Of course, the Fed has never\n3\n\nJohn B. Taylor, “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Series on Public Policy, NorthHolland, 39, 1993, pp. 195–214.\n\n5\n\n\fadopted a formal reaction function or simple rule for setting monetary policy. But the FOMC\ndoes look at the implications of various rules for interest rates when it makes its policy\ndecisions.\nThe fact that the FOMC has not adopted a formal reaction function might reflect the desire for\ndiscretion on the part of some policymakers. But it also reflects the difficulty in reaching a\nconsensus. The Committee is composed of 19 members with varying views about how the\neconomy functions, the shocks affecting the economy, and how policy should be set to meet\nthe FOMC’s monetary policy goals. Despite not having formally adopted a particular rule, the\nFed appeared to behave in a systematic way at various times in the past. Indeed, Taylor’s 1993\narticle noted that his rule approximated Federal Reserve policy setting over the 1987–1992\nperiod, save for a deviation during the stock market crash of 1987.\nI believe that despite the challenges, there would be large benefits to the FOMC reaching a\nconsensus on a reaction function that could serve as a useful guide to understanding its\nbehavior. Those benefits would be in the form of increased transparency and in the alignment\nof the public’s expectations with policymakers’ intentions. As I’ve discussed before, there are\nlimitations to the use of simple rules, and no central bank can be constrained by one simple rule\nin all circumstances. Rules are basically intended to work well on average, but any central bank\nlooks at many variables in determining policy. There will be times when policy must deviate\nfrom a reaction function or policy rule. However, simple rules do provide valuable benchmarks\nfor assessing the appropriate stance of policy. They also provide guidance about the likely path\nof policy and thus are intended to reduce volatility. However, this outcome cannot happen\nunless the central bank is willing to publicly communicate a reaction function or rule.\nAnother benefit of articulating a rule is enhanced accountability. There will inevitably be times\nwhen economic developments fall outside the scope of our models and warrant unusual\nmonetary policy action. Events such as 9/11, the Asian financial crisis, the collapse of Lehman\nBrothers, and the 1987 stock market crash may require departures from the simple rule.\n6\n\n\fHaving articulated a rule guiding policymaking in normal times, the policymaker will be\nexpected to explain the departures from the rule in these unusual circumstances. With the rule\nas a baseline, departures can be quantified and inform us how excessively tight or easy policy\nmight be relative to normal. If the events are temporary, policymakers will have to explain how\nand when policy is likely to return to normal.\nThus, I see several benefits to the FOMC reaching a consensus on a reaction function or policy\nrule, including aligning expectations for policy and enhancing transparency and accountability\nof the policymaking process.\nForward Guidance\nOne way to think about the policy reaction function is as a form of forward guidance. Indeed, it\nis perhaps the best and most useful form of forward guidance.\nIn normal times, forward guidance provides the public with information about the expected\npath of policy. As I’ve discussed, forward guidance is a form of transparency that reduces\nvolatility by reducing policy uncertainty relative to discretionary decision-making.\nHowever, with the policy rate at or near zero, forward guidance can play a role in increasing the\ndegree of accommodation. When the policy rate is constrained by the zero lower bound, the\nfuture policy rate becomes potentially more important than the current policy rate in\ninfluencing current economic conditions through its impact on expectations. In some models,\nwhen faced with the zero lower bound, it can be desirable to indicate that future policy rates\nwill be kept lower for longer than might otherwise be the case.4 Thus, policymakers may want\nto deliberately commit to deviating from what they would otherwise choose to do under\nnormal conditions, such as following a Taylor-like rule or their normal reaction function. In\nthese models, such a commitment would tend to raise inflation expectations and lower longrun nominal rates, thereby inducing households and businesses to spend more today.\n4\n\nGauti B. Eggertsson and Michael Woodford, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1, 2003, pp. 139–211.\n\n7\n\n\fThis use of forward guidance asks more of policymakers than just articulating a reaction\nfunction. In a sense, it requires more of a commitment from policymakers; it requires them to\ncommit to a future path that will not be time consistent if policymakers were only forward\nlooking. Instead, policymakers need to commit to a policy path that is history dependent. As I\nnoted, you can think of this as a commitment to deviate from a prior reaction function,\nparticularly if that reaction function makes no provision for operating at the zero lower bound.\nIf such a commitment can be made credible, it can yield better economic outcomes. But\nmanaging the public’s beliefs about the future policy path is challenging if policymakers must\nconvince the public that they will not behave as they have in the past. And I would argue that\nthat is the circumstance that the FOMC faces. 5\nManaging expectations is even more challenging when policymakers have not been clear about\nthe reaction function they use in normal times. How can policymakers credibly commit to\ndeviate from something they have never committed to in the first place? How can\npolicymakers convey that they will be implementing policy that is more accommodative than\nnormal when they have not been clear about what would constitute the normal degree of\naccommodation?\nManaging the public’s expectations may be not only difficult but also counterproductive.\nWithout the public’s understanding of policymaking in normal times, trying to pursue a\ncommitment to looser-than-normal policy may send the wrong signal. For example, if the\npublic hears that the policy rate will be lower for longer, it may interpret the message as\npolicymakers saying that they expect the economy to be weaker for longer. If this is the\ninterpretation, then the forward guidance will weaken rather than strengthen current\nspending.\n\n5\n\nThis would not be the case if the reaction function or rule explicitly described how policy would be conducted at\nthe zero lower bound. In that case, new forward guidance would not be required, as the reaction function would\nhave already notified the public what to expect.\n\n8\n\n\fWhere Do We Go from Here?\nMy preference for dealing with forward guidance is for the FOMC to articulate a reaction\nfunction as best it can. This entails describing a systematic approach to policymaking where\npolicy decisions are based on available information in a consistent and predictable way. I\nbelieve the most recent FOMC statement took a step in this direction when we moved to a\nqualitative form of forward guidance by stating that we will be assessing progress – both\nrealized and expected – toward our policy objectives. The idea that policy will change as we\napproach our objectives has the flavor of a reaction function.\nBut, of course, there is more work to do. Because we do not know the true model of the\neconomy, I would suggest the Committee begin by considering a set of robust policy rules\ndesigned to have good results in a variety of models and across various stages of the business\ncycle. Such robust rules recognize that data are measured imprecisely and are subject to\nrevision.\nThese robust rules typically indicate that policy should respond to changes in the gap between\ninflation and the inflation goal, and to changes in the deviation of output from a measure of\npotential output, or to changes in unemployment from the steady-state or the natural rate of\nunemployment. Most robust rules suggest that the reaction to the changes in the inflation gap\nbe more than one-for-one and should exceed the reaction to changes in the output or\nunemployment gap. The rules also suggest that policy should be somewhat inertial. By\nrecognizing the fundamental difficulty in measuring potential output or the natural rate of\nunemployment, I think a good case can be made to consider rules that rely on the growth of\noutput or changes in the unemployment rate or employment growth.\nI want to stress that these rules suggest that policy should respond to changes in the output or\nunemployment gap not because policy is seeking to fine-tune the real economy but because\ndoing so allows the economy to efficiently use resources given the economic disturbances that\nit experiences.\n9\n\n\fBy considering such robust rules, the FOMC might be able to move toward a consensus on a\nqualitative description of its reaction function as an important first step. For example, we\nwould not have to specify the precise mathematical rule but would provide assessments of key\nvariables and then communicate our policy decisions in terms of changes in these key variables.\nIf policy were changed, then we would explain that change in terms of how the variables in our\nresponse function changed. If we choose a consistent set of variables and systematically use\nthem to describe our policy choices, the public will form more accurate judgments about the\nlikely course of policy – thereby reducing uncertainty and promoting stability.\nThe FOMC has kept the federal funds rate at effectively zero since December 2008. For much\nof this time, interest rate rules suggested that the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates\nwas constraining policy; in other words, that nominal rates should be negative if that were\npossible. However, many robust rules now suggest that given the progress the economy has\nmade over the past year, policy either is no longer constrained or will soon not be constrained\nby the zero bound. That is, they indicate that the policy rate should be above zero.\nRule-based policymaking would require the FOMC to indicate how it plans to adjust policy to a\nmore normal stance. The Committee could decide to simply follow the prescriptions offered by\nthe reaction function. Or instead, the Committee might decide that normalization will be\ndelayed with a more gradual adjustment of rates relative to the prescriptions of the reaction\nfunction. But even if the FOMC were not prepared to choose a particular rule, it could\narticulate more clearly a qualitative reaction function that would serve as a baseline for future\nchanges in policy as we exit the zero lower bound. It is my belief that doing so would be a more\nunderstandable form of forward guidance, less subject to misinterpretation as policy transitions\nfrom unusual times to more normal times.\n\n10\n\n\f"

The Global Interdependence Center (GIC) has once again\norganized another opportunity to exchange views and discuss important topics on truly\nglobal issues.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Banque de France is in its third century, having been founded in 1800. Last week, I\nspoke in London, where the Bank of England has been operating since 1694. So, I\nhesitate to mention that the Federal Reserve is marking its 100th anniversary this year.\nThe Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created a uniquely American approach to a central\nbank – a decentralized central bank – with 12 independent Federal Reserve Banks\naround the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This unique\ngovernance structure requires that I forewarn you that the views I express are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic Conditions\nThe U.S. economy is now nearly five years into a recovery that began in June 2009. The\nrecovery has been lackluster in many ways, yet it has made considerable progress\nnonetheless. The unemployment rate, for example, has fallen from its peak of 10.0\npercent to 6.7 percent. Employment gains have restored some 8 million jobs since the\ntrough, representing more than 90 percent of the jobs lost since the peak. Stock prices\nhave recovered, housing prices are up, and earnings at many businesses are healthy. It\nis my general view that the U.S. economy is on firmer footing today than it has been in\nseveral years. This is a cause for some optimism for continued progress in 2014.\nIn recent weeks, there has been a blizzard of economic reports, which have come in\nweaker than expected. I believe that weakness largely reflects the severe winter\nweather rather than a frozen recovery. So, we must be wary of attaching too much\nsignificance to the latest numbers. As a monetary policymaker, I prefer to take a longer\nview rather than let our decisions be whipsawed by the most recent statistics, which are\noften noisy and subject to revision. Because monetary policy tends to work with a lag,\nwe must keep our attention focused on the intermediate- to longer-term underlying\ntrends if we are to make wise decisions.\nBased on the latest GDP numbers revised last month, the U.S. economy performed\n2\n\n\fnoticeably better in the second half of 2013 than in the first half. Specifically, real\noutput grew at a 3.3 percent pace in the second half of the year compared with 1.8\npercent in the first half.\nWhile this is far from the robust growth that many would like to see, it continues to\nrepresent steady progress and an improving economy. My forecast calls for about 3\npercent growth in 2014. This is in line with the central tendency of 2.8 to 3.2 percent\ngrowth reported by my colleagues on the FOMC in December 2013.\nThere has been discussion of some recent weakness in consumer spending, housing\nstarts, and housing sales. For instance, in January, total retail sales fell by 0.4 percent;\nhousing starts dropped sharply in January by 2 percent compared with the level of a\nyear ago; and existing home sales dropped about 5 percent from a year ago. While\nsome softening in home sales might be expected from the rise in mortgage rates, those\nrates are still very low by historical standards, and new home sales surged in January,\nrising to their highest level since 2008. Despite the mixed housing data, continued\nhousehold formation constitutes a source of growth in housing demand. So, I expect\nthat housing will continue its recovery in 2014, once we get past the severe weather.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. GDP, proved to be\nquite resilient in 2013, despite the rise in payroll taxes at the start of the year, a\ngovernment shutdown, significant uncertainties about future tax policy, and the\nimplications of health-care reform.\nGoing forward, I expect that there will be less fiscal drag on the economy in 2014 than\nwe saw in 2013. Moreover, rising home prices and stock prices have helped improve\nconsumer balance sheets. I have frequently noted that one reason for the less-thanrobust growth in consumption during this recovery has been the deleveraging efforts by\nconsumers. With consumers carrying too much debt, spending was inevitably going to\ngive way to more saving as consumers attempted to restore the health of their balance\nsheets. That process has been playing out, and the drag from deleveraging is waning. In\n3\n\n\faddition, steady, moderate job growth has led to modest increases in income. I foresee\nsomewhat more robust spending by consumers in the coming year as these trends\ncontinue.\nWeather also affected recent manufacturing numbers in the U.S. The Philadelphia Fed’s\nBusiness Outlook Survey of manufacturers in our region has been a reliable indicator of\nnational manufacturing trends in the U.S. In February, the diffusion index of current\nactivity fell into negative territory for the first time in nine months. However, most\nrespondents attributed the weakness to the severe winter weather. Consistent with\nsuch comments, expectations for manufacturing activity six months ahead increased in\nFebruary.\nOn the job front, the February employment report posted payroll gains of 175,000 jobs,\nfollowing an increase of 129,000 jobs in January, and 84,000 in December. All three of\nthese numbers most likely reflected in part the effect of the unusually severe winter\nweather.\nAs we look at the employment averages over several months, the news remains\npositive. Based on the latest revision, firms added an average of 194,000 jobs per\nmonth in 2013, which is a somewhat better pace than in 2012. This consistent pace of\njob growth was enough to drop the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent in February,\nwhich is a full percentage point lower than a year ago. I expect that the unemployment\nrate will reach about 6.2 percent by the end of 2014, and, if anything, that may prove\ntoo pessimistic. Given the recent trends, an unemployment rate below 6 percent is\ncertainly plausible.\nIn terms of the other part of the Fed’s mandate, inflation has been running somewhat\nbelow the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation\nis the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures,\nor PCE inflation. It came in at 1.1 percent last year. It is important to defend our 2\npercent inflation target both from below and above. Yet, I anticipate, as the FOMC\n4\n\n\findicated in its most recent statement, that inflation will move back toward our target\nover time. Economic growth is firming, and some of the factors that have held inflation\ndown, such as the one-time cut in payments to Medicare providers, are likely to abate\nover time.\nAn additional and important determinant of actual inflation is consumer and business\nexpectations of inflation. I am encouraged that inflation expectations remain near their\nlonger-term averages and consistent with our 2 percent target. Given the large amount\nof monetary accommodation that we have added and continue to add to the economy, I\nthink there is some upside risk to inflation in the longer term.\nOf course, with any forecast, there are risks. While there continues to be some\ndownside risk to growth, for the first time in years, I see the potential for more upside\nrisk to the economic outlook. We need to consider this possibility as we calibrate\nmonetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nSo let me turn to some issues for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has taken\nextraordinary policy actions to support the economic recovery. The Fed has lowered its\npolicy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially zero, where it has been for more\nthan five years. Since the policy rate cannot go any lower, the Fed has attempted to\nprovide additional accommodation through large-scale asset purchases. We are now in\nour third round of this quantitative easing.\nSince September 2012, the FOMC has added about $1.3 trillion in long-term Treasuries\nand mortgage-backed securities to its balance sheet through this program, buying at a\npace of $85 billion a month in 2013. This program, known as QE3, is already twice the\nsize of the last round of asset purchases initiated in November 2010, known as QE2.\nIn December 2013, the Committee announced that it would reduce the pace of\npurchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per month. In January, it announced a further\n5\n\n\freduction to $65 billion. The FOMC is now on a path of measured reductions, which, if\ncontinued, will end the purchase program later this year. If the economy continues to\nimprove, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an\nenvironment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the\nopposite direction.\nIn addition to asset purchases, the Fed is using forward guidance as a policy tool, which\nis intended to inform the public about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the\nfuture. In this dimension, the FOMC has indicated that it intends to leave the policy rate\nnear zero well past the time that the unemployment rate falls below the 6.5 percent\nthreshold. The FOMC had previously indicated that this was the earliest point at which\nit would consider raising interest rates, especially if projected inflation continues to run\nbelow the Committee’s 2 percent target.\nEven though the FOMC has said that it doesn’t anticipate raising rates when the\neconomy crosses that threshold, I believe that with the economy so close to the\nunemployment threshold, we face a communications challenge. In particular, we have\nnot described how policy will be conducted after the unemployment rate falls below 6.5\npercent.\nCommunication Challenges\nBut before we offer further forward guidance, it is important to be clear about what this\nforward guidance is supposed to accomplish. As that famous American baseball player\nYogi Berra is reported to have said, “You have to be careful if you don’t know where\nyou’re going because you might end up somewhere else.”\nOne way to think of forward guidance is that it is just another step toward increased\ntransparency and effective communication of monetary policy. This approach seeks to\nclarify how policymakers will alter policy as economic conditions change, that is, to\ndescribe a reaction function. By being more transparent about how policy will evolve as\n\n6\n\n\fa function of economic conditions, this approach can help the public form more\naccurate expectations about the future path of monetary policy.\nEconomists have learned that expectations play an important role in determining\neconomic outcomes. When businesses and households have a better understanding of\nhow monetary policy is likely to evolve, they can make more informed spending and\nfinancial decisions. If policymakers can reduce uncertainty about the course of\nmonetary policy, the economy is likely to perform more efficiently.\nOf course, in order to communicate something about the reaction function, you have to\nhave one. That means in order to succeed with this approach to forward guidance,\npolicymakers must be able to agree on how they will systematically respond to changes\nin economic conditions. To be useful, however, the reaction function need not be\nmechanistic. Qualitative information about such a function and how it will be\nimplemented can also be useful and meaningful. Nevertheless, some degree of\ncommitment to abide by the specified reaction function is necessary if the\ncommunication is to achieve the desired result of reducing policy uncertainty and\nproviding meaningful forward guidance.\nA somewhat different rationale or view of forward guidance is that it is a way of\nincreasing accommodation when the policy rate is at or near the zero lower bound.\nSome models suggest that when you are at the zero lower bound, it can be desirable, or\noptimal, to indicate that future policy rates will be kept “lower for longer” than might\notherwise be the case. Thus, policymakers may want to deliberately commit to\ndeviating from what they would otherwise choose to do under normal conditions, such\nas following a Taylor-like rule. In these models, such a commitment would tend to raise\ninflation expectations and lower long-term nominal rates, thereby inducing households\nand businesses to spend more today.\nThis approach asks more of forward guidance than just articulating a reaction function.\nIt takes more credibility and commitment because it requires policymakers to directly\n7\n\n\finfluence and manage the public’s beliefs about the future policy path that differs from\nhow policymakers behaved in the past. As I have indicated in previous speeches, this\napproach to forward guidance can backfire if the policy is misunderstood. 1 For example,\nif the public hears that the policy rate will be lower for longer, it may interpret this news\nas policymakers saying that they expect the economy to be weaker for longer. If that is\nthe interpretation of the message, then the forward guidance will not succeed and may\neven weaken current spending.\nThe FOMC has not been clear about the purpose of its forward guidance. Is it purely a\ntransparency device, or is it a way to commit to a more accommodative future policy\nstance to add more accommodation today? This lack of clarity makes it difficult to\ncommunicate the stance of policy and the conditionality of policy on the state of the\neconomy.\nI believe there is another – perhaps more fundamental – tension underlying forward\nguidance and communication. Forward guidance in either of the two approaches I have\ndiscussed requires a degree of commitment to conduct future policy in some particular\nmanner. Commitment is central to the success of either approach. Yet, I would suggest\nthat the old “rules versus discretion” debate is alive and well. This, of course, is not a\nnew tension within the FOMC, nor is it one that is likely to go away in the near term.\nBut the heightened weight and prominence given to forward guidance as a policy tool\nhas certainly shined a spotlight on this longstanding debate.\nThe desire to maintain flexibility to respond to “events on the ground” is a strong one.\nOne can make the case that discretion is deeply ingrained in most policy institutions,\nparticularly the Fed. Yet, the desire to maintain discretion is anathema to the\ncommitment required for successful forward guidance. Policymakers cannot maintain\ndiscretion and simultaneously commit to forward guidance and expect that guidance to\nbe effective.\n1\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Forward Guidance,” speech to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy\nResearch’s (SIEPR) Associates Meeting, February 12, 2013, Stanford, CA.\n\n8\n\n\fConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve at a moderate\npace. We are likely to see growth of around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor\nmarkets will continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue to\ndecline, reaching 6.2 percent or lower by the end of 2014. I also believe that inflation\nexpectations will be relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2\npercent over the next year.\nOn monetary policy, we must back away from increasing the degree of policy\naccommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy. Reducing the\npace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace\nmay leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to\nthe FOMC forecasts.\nEven after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary policy will still be highly\naccommodative. As the expansion gains traction, the challenge will be to reduce\naccommodation and to normalize policy in a way that ensures that inflation remains\nclose to our target, that the economy continues to grow, and that we avoid sowing the\nseeds of another financial crisis.\nLet me conclude with this thought. Over the past five years, the Fed and, dare I say,\nmany other central banks have become much more interventionist. I do not think this is\na particularly healthy state of affairs for the central banks or our economies. The crisis\nin the U.S. has long passed. With a growing economy and the Fed’s long-term asset\npurchases coming to an end, now is the time to contemplate restoring some semblance\nof normalcy to monetary policy.\nIn my view, the proper role for monetary policy is to work behind the scenes in limited\nand systematic ways to promote long-term growth and price stability. But since the\nonset of the financial crisis, central banks have become highly interventionist in their\nefforts to manipulate asset prices and financial markets in general as they attempt to\n9\n\n\ffine-tune economic outcomes. This approach has continued well past the end of the\nfinancial crisis. While the motivations may be noble, we have created an environment\nwhere “it is all about the Fed.” Market participants focus entirely too much on how the\ncentral bank may tweak its policy, and central bankers have become too sensitive and\ndesirous of managing prices in the financial world. I do not see this as a healthy\nsymbiotic relationship for the long term.\nIf financial market participants believe that their success depends primarily on the next\ndecisions of monetary policymakers rather than economic fundamentals, our capital\nmarkets will cease to deliver the economic benefits they are capable of providing. And\nif central banks do not limit their interventionist strategies and focus on returning to\nmore normal policymaking aimed at promoting price stability and long-term growth,\nthen they will simply encourage the financial markets to ignore fundamentals and to\nfocus, instead, on the next actions of the central bank.\nI hope we can find a way to normalize the role of monetary policy to one that is less\ninterventionist, less discretionary, and more systematic. I believe our longer-term\neconomic health will be the beneficiary.\n\n10\n\n\f"

The Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum is a relatively new\norganization, yet it is already establishing itself as an important venue for the exchange\nof views and ideas among policymakers and the private sector. It is similar to the Global\nInterdependence Center, a think tank based in Philadelphia, which is hosting a\nconference at the Banque de France next week, where I will join my friend Governor\nChristian Noyer. I note with interest that Governor Noyer will be speaking to you in just\na few weeks’ time.\n\n1\n\n\fOur venue today has an impressive history. The Worshipful Company of Armourers and\nBrasiers has been operating at this location since 1346. That is nearly 350 years before\nthe Bank of England was founded in 1694. Its original building survived the Great Fire of\n1666, and this current building survived the 1940 Blitz. With so much history steeped in\nthese halls, I hesitate to mention that the Federal Reserve is marking its 100th\nanniversary this year. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created a uniquely American\napproach to a central bank – a decentralized central bank – with 12 independent\nFederal Reserve Banks around the country and a Board of Governors in Washington,\nD.C. This unique governance structure requires that I forewarn you that the views I\nexpress are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System\nor my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic Conditions\nThe U.S. economy is now nearly five years into a recovery that began in June 2009. The\nrecovery has been lackluster in many ways, yet it has made considerable progress\nnonetheless. The unemployment rate, for example, has fallen from its peak of 10.0\npercent to 6.6 percent. Employment gains have restored some 7.8 million jobs since the\ntrough, representing about 90 percent of the jobs lost since the peak. Stock prices have\nrecovered, housing prices are up, and earnings at many businesses are healthy. It is my\ngeneral view that the U.S. economy is on firmer footing today than it has been in several\nyears. This is a cause for some optimism for continued progress in 2014.\nIn recent weeks, there has been a blizzard of economic reports, which have come in\nweaker than expected. I believe that weakness largely reflects the severe winter\nweather rather than a frozen recovery. So, we must be wary of attaching too much\nsignificance to the latest numbers. As a monetary policymaker, I prefer to take a longer\nview rather than let our decisions be whipsawed by the most recent statistics, which are\noften noisy and subject to revision. Because monetary policy tends to work with a lag,\nwe must keep our attention focused on the intermediate- to longer-term underlying\ntrends if we are to make wise decisions.\n2\n\n\fBased on the latest GDP numbers revised last week, the U.S. economy performed\nnoticeably better in the second half of 2013 than in the first half. Specifically, real\noutput grew at a 3.3 percent pace in the second half of the year compared with 1.8\npercent in the first half.\nWhile this is far from the robust growth that many would like to see, it continues to\nrepresent steady progress and an improving economy. My forecast calls for about 3\npercent growth in 2014. This is in line with the central tendency of 2.8 to 3.2 percent\ngrowth reported by my colleagues on the FOMC in December 2013.\nThere has been discussion of some recent weakness in consumer spending, housing\nstarts, and housing sales. For instance, in January, total retail sales fell by 0.4 percent;\nhousing starts dropped sharply in January by 2 percent compared with the level of a\nyear ago; and existing home sales dropped about 5 percent from a year ago. While\nsome softening in home sales might be expected from the rise in mortgage rates, those\nrates are still very low by historical standards, and new home sales surged in January,\nrising to their highest level since 2008. Despite the mixed housing data, continued\nhousehold formation constitutes a source of growth in housing demand. So, I expect\nthat housing will continue its recovery in 2014, once we get past the severe weather.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. GDP, proved to be\nquite resilient in 2013, despite the rise in payroll taxes at the start of the year, a\ngovernment shutdown, significant uncertainties about future tax policy, and the\nimplications of health-care reform.\nGoing forward, I expect that there will be less fiscal drag on the economy in 2014 than\nwe saw in 2013. Moreover, rising home prices and stock prices have helped improve\nconsumer balance sheets. I have frequently noted that one reason for the less-thanrobust growth in consumption during this recovery has been the deleveraging efforts by\nconsumers. With consumers carrying too much debt, spending was inevitably going to\ngive way to more saving as consumers attempted to restore the health of their balance\n3\n\n\fsheets. That process has been playing out, and the drag from deleveraging is waning. In\naddition, steady, moderate job growth has led to modest increases in income. I foresee\nsomewhat more robust spending by consumers in the coming year as these trends\ncontinue.\nWeather also affected recent manufacturing numbers in the U.S. The Philadelphia Fed’s\nBusiness Outlook Survey of manufacturers in our region has been a reliable indicator of\nnational manufacturing trends in the U.S. In February, the diffusion index of current\nactivity fell into negative territory for the first time in nine months. However, most\nrespondents attributed the weakness to the severe winter weather. Consistent with\nsuch comments, expectations for manufacturing activity six months ahead increased in\nFebruary.\nOn the job front, the January employment report posted payroll gains of 113,000 jobs,\nfollowing an increase of 75,000 jobs in December, again most likely reflecting in part the\neffect of the unusually severe winter weather.\nAs we look at the employment averages over several months, the news remains\npositive. Based on the latest revision, firms added an average of 194,000 jobs per\nmonth in 2013, which is a somewhat better pace than in 2012. This consistent pace of\njob growth was enough to drop the unemployment rate to 6.6 percent in January. I\nexpect that the unemployment rate will reach about 6.2 percent by the end of 2014,\nand, if anything, that may prove too pessimistic. Given the recent trends, an\nunemployment rate below 6 percent is certainly plausible.\nIn terms of the other part of the Fed’s mandate, inflation has been running somewhat\nbelow the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation\nis the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures,\nor PCE inflation. It came in at 1.1 percent last year. It is important to defend our 2\npercent inflation target both from below and above. Yet, I anticipate, as the FOMC\nindicated in its most recent statement, that inflation will move back toward our target\n4\n\n\fover time. Economic growth is firming, and some of the factors that have held inflation\ndown, such as the one-time cut in payments to Medicare providers, are likely to abate\nover time.\nAn additional and important determinant of actual inflation is consumer and business\nexpectations of inflation. I am encouraged that inflation expectations remain near their\nlonger-term averages and consistent with our 2 percent target. Given the large amount\nof monetary accommodation that we have added and continue to add to the economy, I\nthink there is some upside risk to inflation in the longer term.\nOf course, with any forecast, there are risks. While there continues to be some\ndownside risk to growth, for the first time in years, I see the potential for more upside\nrisk to the economic outlook. We need to consider this possibility as we calibrate\nmonetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nSo let me turn to some issues for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has taken\nextraordinary policy actions to support the economic recovery. The Fed has lowered its\npolicy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially zero, where it has been for more\nthan five years. Since the policy rate cannot go any lower, the Fed has attempted to\nprovide additional accommodation through large-scale asset purchases. We are now in\nour third round of this quantitative easing.\nSince September 2012, the FOMC has added about $1.3 trillion in long-term Treasuries\nand mortgage-backed securities to its balance sheet through this program, buying at a\npace of $85 billion a month in 2013. This program, known as QE3, is already twice the\nsize of the last round of asset purchases initiated in November 2010, known as QE2.\nIn December 2013, the Committee announced that it would reduce the pace of\npurchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per month. In January, it announced a further\nreduction to $65 billion. The FOMC is now on a path of measured reductions, which, if\n5\n\n\fcontinued, will end the purchase program later this year. If the economy continues to\nimprove, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an\nenvironment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the\nopposite direction.\nIn addition to asset purchases, the Fed is using forward guidance as a policy tool, which\nis intended to inform the public about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the\nfuture. In this dimension, the FOMC has indicated that it intends to leave the policy rate\nnear zero well past the time that the unemployment rate falls below the 6.5 percent\nthreshold. The FOMC had previously indicated that this was the earliest point at which\nit would consider raising interest rates, especially if projected inflation continues to run\nbelow the Committee’s 2 percent target.\nEven though the FOMC has said that it doesn’t anticipate raising rates when the\neconomy crosses that threshold, I believe that with the economy so close to the\nunemployment threshold, we face a communications challenge.

The organizers have put together another great and\ntimely program with distinguished participants. However, with Governor Stein and Presidents\nKocherlakota, Evans, and myself all here, I am beginning to wonder if we are in Washington\nrather than in New York. Nevertheless, it is great to be on the program with so many of my\nfellow policymakers. If you listen carefully to each of us, you will understand why I start with\nthe usual caveat that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n1\n\n\fCommunication and transparency have been important themes in monetary policy discussions\nover the past decade or more. Indeed, in 2007 this Monetary Policy Forum began with Alan\nBlinder’s keynote address titled “Making Monetary Policy and Talking about It.” In part, this\nemphasis on communication and transparency reflects the steady evolution in the theory and\nscience of monetary policy. Reflecting this emerging consensus, the Federal Reserve during the\ntenure of Chairman Bernanke has taken a number of actions to promote increased\ntransparency about its actions and policies. In fact, President Evans and I served on a\nsubcommittee led by current Chair Yellen specifically focused on improving communication.\nOur efforts to improve communication took on heightened importance as the FOMC responded\nto the financial crisis and recession. Since December 2008, the federal funds rate target has\nbeen near zero. Since the nominal funds rate cannot go below zero, we had to develop\nalternative policy tools in an effort to provide further accommodation to support the recovery.\nWe also had to figure out how and what to communicate about these new tools. Thus, wellunderstood communication practices about traditional policy tools gave way to untested ways\nto describe these new tools. The task was further complicated because one of the\nunconventional tools was so-called forward guidance. Forward guidance seeks to inform the\npublic about the future path of policy rather than describing a policy action taken today. Thus,\neffective forward guidance is all about communication and what it conveys or doesn’t convey.\nIn my brief time today, I will focus on why I think communication is such a challenge and discuss\nsome of the choices the Committee faces going forward.\nCurrent State of Affairs\nFirst, communication is difficult because monetary policy is more complicated than it used to\nbe. With the traditional policy tool at the zero lower bound, the Committee has focused on two\nunconventional tools. The first is the purchase of long-term assets, and the second, as I\nmentioned, is forward guidance. The asset purchase program has had many dimensions, such\nas the overall volume of purchases, the pace of purchases, the kinds of assets targeted for\npurchase, and the criteria for starting and stopping the purchases. Policymakers have tried to\n2\n\n\ffine-tune the program along each dimension while assessing the trade-offs among them and\nthe trade-offs with other policy tools, such as the traditional funds rate decision. With so many\nmoving parts to our policy framework, it is not surprising that communication is very\ncomplicated.\nWe are now in the third round of asset purchases, or quantitative easing. Since September\n2012, the FOMC has added some $1.3 trillion in long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed\nsecurities to its balance sheet through this program, buying at a pace of $85 billion a month in\n2013. This program, known as QE3, is already twice the size of the last round of asset\npurchases that was initiated in November 2010, known as QE2.\nIn December 2013, the Committee announced that it would reduce the pace of purchases from\n$85 billion to $75 billion per month. In January, it announced a further reduction to $65 billion.\nThe FOMC is now on a path of measured reductions, which, if continued, will end the purchase\nprogram late this year. If the economy continues to improve, we could find ourselves still trying\nto increase accommodation in an environment when history suggests that policy should\nperhaps be moving in the opposite direction.\nCommunication about the future path of asset purchases has, at times, been imprecise and\nconfusing. Last June, the Committee suggested that it might begin to reduce the pace of\npurchases in the fall and perhaps end them when the unemployment rate reached 7 percent.\nHowever, the Committee did not even begin the tapering process until unemployment had\nreached 7 percent. It now seems unlikely that the program will end until the unemployment\nrate is below – or as indicated in the FOMC statement, perhaps “well below” – 6.5 percent.\nWhy is the 6.5 percent unemployment rate important? Because the Committee made it\nimportant. The Committee, in essence, told the markets that the 6.5 percent unemployment\nrate was an important quantitative marker. In December 2012, the FOMC indicated that it\nintended to keep the federal funds rate target near zero at least as long as the unemployment\nrate was above 6.5 percent, the inflation rate between one and two years ahead was projected\nto be no more than 2.5 percent, and inflation expectations remained well anchored. However,\n3\n\n\fit is important to remember that these guideposts were thresholds, not triggers. The FOMC\nhad not made a commitment to act once a threshold was reached, nor did it indicate how\npolicy would evolve after a threshold was reached. It simply signaled that it would not act prior\nto crossing one of the thresholds.\nYet, the 6.5 percent threshold will soon become irrelevant, and it probably is already. So the\nCommittee, at a minimum, has to revamp its communications regarding the future federal\nfunds rate path. Given that we are still easing policy by buying assets, it is pretty clear that\neven though the threshold will soon come and go, the Committee is unlikely to contemplate\nraising rates as long as it is buying assets. Put another way, the practical constraint at this point\nfor raising the policy rate is no longer the unemployment rate but the fact that we are still\nbuying assets. Indeed, the Committee has acknowledged that it will likely be appropriate to\nkeep rates at their current low rates well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5 percent.\nTherefore, in my view, the threshold has already lost its meaning as a guidepost. It needs to be\nreplaced with something that is more relevant and informative.\nThis poses the challenge of how and what to communicate about policy going forward. Our\nactions and the data have made the current form of forward guidance outdated and mostly\nirrelevant. Indeed, one could reasonably wonder whether the inflation threshold has any\nmeaning at this point. In other words, by allowing the unemployment threshold to pass\nwithout taking action, the public might conclude that the Committee could easily decide to let\nthe inflation threshold pass without taking action as well.\nCompeting Roles for Forward Guidance\nBefore we offer further forward guidance, it is important to be clear about what this forward\nguidance is intended to accomplish. As Yogi Berra is reported to have said, “You have to be\ncareful if you don’t know where you’re going because you might end up somewhere else.”\nOne way to think of forward guidance is that it is just another step toward increased\ntransparency and effective communication of monetary policy. This approach seeks to clarify\nhow policymakers will alter policy as economic conditions change, that is, to describe a reaction\n4\n\n\ffunction. By being more transparent about how policy will evolve as a function of economic\nconditions, this approach can help the public form more accurate expectations about the future\npath of monetary policy.\nEconomists have learned that expectations play an important role in determining economic\noutcomes. When businesses and households have a better understanding of how monetary\npolicy is likely to evolve, they can make more informed spending and financial decisions. If\nmonetary policymakers can reduce uncertainty about the course of monetary policy, the\neconomy is likely to perform more efficiently.\nOf course, in order to communicate something about the reaction function, you have to have\none. That means in order to be successful with this approach to forward guidance,\npolicymakers must be able to agree on how they will systematically respond to changes in\neconomic conditions. To be useful, however, the reaction function need not be mechanistic.\nQualitative information about such a function and how it will be implemented can also be\nuseful and meaningful. Nevertheless, some degree of commitment to abide by the specified\nreaction function is necessary, if the communication is to achieve the desired result of reducing\npolicy uncertainty and providing meaningful forward guidance. The excuse that “this time is\ndifferent” undermines the commitment and the credibility of the information that the\ncommunication is seeking to provide. I would add that a committed and credible approach to\nsuch a systematic approach to policy is helpful and informative regardless of whether you are at\nthe zero lower bound or not.\nA somewhat different rationale or view of forward guidance is that it is a way of increasing\naccommodation in a period when the policy rate is at or near the zero lower bound. Some\nmodels suggest that when you are at the zero lower bound, it can be desirable, or optimal, to\nindicate that future policy rates will be kept “lower for longer” than might otherwise be the\ncase. Thus, policymakers intentionally commit to deviating from what they would otherwise\nchoose to do in normal times, such as following the Taylor rule. In these models, such a\ncommitment would tend to raise inflation expectations and lower long-term nominal rates,\nthereby inducing households and businesses to spend more today.\n5\n\n\fThis approach asks more of forward guidance than just articulating a reaction function. It takes\nmore credibility and commitment because it requires policymakers to directly influence and\nmanage the public’s beliefs about the future policy path in ways that are different from how\nthey may have behaved in the past. As I have indicated in previous speeches, this approach to\nforward guidance can backfire if the policy is misunderstood. 1 For example, if the public hears\nthat the policy rate will be lower for longer, it may interpret this news as policymakers saying\nthat they expect the economy to be weaker for longer. If that is the interpretation of the\nmessage, then the forward guidance will not succeed and may even weaken current spending.\nThe FOMC has not been clear about the purpose of its forward guidance. Is it purely a\ntransparency device, or is it a way to commit to a more accommodative future policy stance to\nadd more accommodation today? This lack of clarity makes it difficult to communicate the\nstance of policy and the conditionality of policy on the state of the economy.\nNote that most formulations of standard, simple policy rules suggest that the federal funds rate\nshould rise very soon – if not already. In other words, the zero lower bound no longer appears\nto be binding. However, the FOMC has provided forward guidance indicating that the federal\nfunds rate will need to be low for some time to come.\nHow do we reconcile this apparent incongruity? It could be that the FOMC is using its forward\nguidance as a commitment device or signal for a more accommodative policy well into the\nfuture, as in the second approach I have discussed. Or, it could be the FOMC views forward\nguidance as a device for increased transparency but that it doesn’t think the standard rules\napply in the current environment. Then what rules do apply? If policymakers are not relying on\na rule or a rule-like reaction function, policy is purely discretionary and forward guidance\nbecomes ineffective. In either case, we have an opportunity and an obligation to provide more\ntransparency and better communication.\n\n1\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Forward Guidance,” speech to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research’s\n(SIEPR) Associates Meeting, February 12, 2013, Stanford, CA\n\n6\n\n\fThis leads me to suggest that there is a more fundamental tension underlying our forward\nguidance and communication challenges. Forward guidance in either of the two approaches\nthat I have discussed requires a degree of commitment to conduct future policy in some\nparticular manner. That commitment is central to the success of either approach. Yet, I would\nsuggest that the old “rules versus discretion” debate is alive and well. This, of course, is not a\nnew tension within the FOMC, nor is it one that is likely to go away in the near term. But the\nheightened weight and prominence given to forward guidance as a policy tool has certainly\nshined a spotlight on this longstanding debate.\nThe desire to maintain flexibility to respond to “events on the ground” is a strong one. One can\nmake the case that discretion is deeply ingrained in most policy institutions, particularly the\nFed. Yet, the desire to maintain discretion is anathema to the commitment required for\nsuccessful forward guidance. Policymakers cannot maintain discretion and simultaneously\ncommit to forward guidance and expect that guidance to be effective.\nSo, I conclude as I began: Forward guidance and clear communications remain important\nchallenges for monetary policymakers.\n\n7\n\n\f"

This is a great event for the region and I am pleased to see it grow year after\nyear.\n1\n\n\fI would like to begin my remarks this morning with a bit of history. We are observing\nthe 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve and that gives me the opportunity, or the\nexcuse, to offer a perspective on this important, but sometimes misunderstood,\ninstitution. I should note that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nOn December 23, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed the act that created the\nFederal Reserve System, and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks opened their doors on\nNovember 16, 1914. I have often described the Federal Reserve as a uniquely American\nform of a central bank – a decentralized central bank. To understand why, we need to\nconsider two earlier attempts at central banking in the United States. Just a few blocks\nfrom the Philadelphia Fed’s present building on Independence Mall, you will find the\nvestiges of both institutions, dating back to the early years when Philadelphia was the\nmajor financial and political center of the country.\nAlexander Hamilton, our first secretary of the Treasury, championed the First Bank of\nthe United States to help our young nation manage its financial affairs. The First Bank\nreceived a 20-year charter from Congress and operated from 1791 to 1811. Although\nthis charter was not renewed, the War of 1812 and the ensuing inflation and economic\nturmoil convinced Congress to establish the Second Bank of the United States, which\noperated from 1816 to 1836. However, Congress could not override the veto of\nPresident Andrew Jackson, and the Second Bank’s charter also lapsed. Both institutions\nfailed to overcome the public’s mistrust of centralized power and special interests.\nNearly 80 years later, Congress tried again. To balance political, economic, and\ngeographic interests, Congress created a Federal Reserve System of 12 regional Reserve\nBanks with oversight provided by a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This\ndecentralized central bank was structured to overcome concerns that its actions would\nbe dominated either by political interests in Washington or by financial interests on Wall\nStreet.\n2\n\n\fThese 12 Reserve Banks perform several roles. They distribute currency, act as a\nbankers’ bank, and generally perform the functions of a central bank, which includes\nserving as the bank for the U.S. Treasury. They also play a critical role in supervising\nmany banks and bank holding companies across the country.\nEach Reserve Bank has a nine-member board of directors selected in a nonpartisan way\nto represent a cross-section of banking, commercial, and community interests. Pat\nHarker, president of the University of Delaware, serves on our board. These directors\nfulfill the traditional governance role, but they also provide valuable insights into\neconomic and financial conditions, which contribute to our assessment of the economy.\nThe Reserve Banks seek to stay in touch with Main Street in other ways. Some have\nBranch boards, and all have advisory councils. Reserve Banks also collect and analyze\ndata and conduct surveys of economic activity. This rich array of information and the\ndiverse views from across the country help policymakers paint a mosaic of the economy\nthat is essential as we formulate national monetary policy.\nWithin the Federal Reserve, the body that makes monetary policy decisions is the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or the FOMC. Here again, Congress has designed the\nsystem with a number of checks and balances. Since 1935, the composition of the\nFOMC has included the seven Governors in Washington, who are appointed by the\nPresident of the United States and confirmed by the Senate, as well as the president of\nthe New York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents who serve one-year terms as\nmembers on a rotating basis.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee’s assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings each\nyear to set monetary policy. The first one in 2014 was held just two weeks ago. In\nnormal times, the Committee votes to adjust short-term interest rates to achieve the\ngoals of monetary policy that Congress has set for us.\n3\n\n\fCongress spelled out the current set of monetary policy goals in 1978. The amended\nFederal Reserve Act specifies that the FOMC “shall maintain long run growth of the\nmonetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential\nto increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment,\nstable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since moderate long-term\ninterest rates generally result when prices are stable and the economy is operating at\nfull employment, many have interpreted these instructions as being a dual mandate to\nmanage fluctuations in employment in the short run while preserving price stability in\nthe long run.\nEconomic Conditions\nIn order to determine the appropriate monetary policy to promote these goals, the\nFOMC must monitor and assess economic developments. So, let me turn to an\nassessment of our economy as we enter 2014.\nIn a nutshell, my view is that the economy is on firmer footing than it has been for the\npast several years. So let’s look at some of the details of how last year ended and the\nimplications for the coming year.\nReal output grew at a 3.2 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of last year,\nfollowing a 4.1 percent growth rate in the third quarter. That means economic growth\ndoubled in the second half of 2013 compared with the first half. Consumer spending\nand business investment in equipment ended the year with strong increases. Inventory\ninvestment and net exports also contributed to growth. On the other side of the ledger,\na decline in residential investment and a sharp decrease in federal government spending\nsubtracted from growth in the fourth quarter of the year. Going forward, I expect that\nthere will be less fiscal drag in 2014 than we saw in 2013 and that housing will continue\nits recovery.\nPersonal consumption, which accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, advanced at an\nannual rate of 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter, the highest personal consumption\n4\n\n\fgrowth rate since fourth quarter 2010. Rising house prices and stock prices have helped\nimprove consumer balance sheets, and steady job growth has added to wage and salary\ngrowth, all of which have supported spending.\nOn the job front, the January employment report showed payroll gains of 113,000 jobs,\nfollowing an increase of 75,000 jobs in December, which was below many analysts’\nexpectations. Yet, these numbers were affected by the unseasonably cold and snowy\nweather. Indeed, winter weather has continued to be unusually disruptive, and that is\nmaking it difficult to assess underlying economic trends. I suspect it may be another\ncouple of months before we have a better read on the economy – hopefully the\nweather will turn better before that!\nWe have to remember that these employment numbers are subject to revisions, and\nsuch revisions can be significant. For instance, in the latest report the November jobs\nnumber was revised up by 33,000, from 241,000 to 274,000, while the December\nnumber was also revised up by 1,000 to 75,000.\nBecause of month-to-month volatility and data revisions, I prefer not to read too much\ninto the most recent numbers but, instead, look at averages over several months. Here\nthe news remains positive. Based on the latest revision, firms added an average of\n194,000 jobs per month in 2013, somewhat better than the pace in 2012. This\nconsistent pace of job growth was enough to drop the unemployment rate 1.2\npercentage points last year. In January, it fell a bit further to 6.6 percent. This is\nnoticeably lower than the FOMC anticipated in its Summary of Economic Projections in\nSeptember 2012, when we started the current asset purchase program. That is, the\nlabor market has performed better than expected, according to the unemployment rate\nmeasure.\nShould we be skeptical of the unemployment rate as an indicator of labor market\nconditions? Some people are because the decline in the unemployment rate reflects\nnot only increases in employment but declines in labor force participation as well.\n5\n\n\fDeclines in participation can include discouraged workers who have stopped looking for\nwork because it is difficult to find a job. There is concern in some quarters that the\nunemployment rate will move back up significantly when these discouraged workers\nreenter the labor force. Based on research by my staff, I am less concerned about this\npossibility. 1\nFirst, it is important to realize that labor force participation rates can decline for reasons\nother than a rise in discouraged workers. Indeed, we have seen steadily declining\nparticipation rates since 2000 that reflect demographic changes, most notably the aging\nof the baby boomers. This trend is continuing and has long been expected to\naccelerate.\nSecond, detailed analysis of the Current Population Survey’s micro data indicates that\nabout three-quarters of the decline in participation since the start of the recession in\nDecember 2007 can be accounted for by increased retirements and movements into\ndisability. Some of these increases might have been driven by the state of the economy.\nFor example, some baby boomers may have moved their retirement decision forward\nafter losing a job. Nevertheless, few of these individuals are likely to reenter the labor\nforce. So, while I do expect some discouraged workers to reenter the labor force as the\neconomy improves, I still believe the overall unemployment rate remains a good\nsummary statistic of labor market conditions.\nThe business sector is also entering the year on a positive note. At the national level,\nmanufacturing activity accelerated over the final three months of 2013. The\nPhiladelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of regional manufacturing, which is a\nreliable indicator of national manufacturing trends, also showed that manufacturing\nactivity picked up in the second half of 2013. In January, the survey’s general activity\nindex posted its eighth consecutive positive number. Expectations for manufacturing\n1\n\nShigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special\nReport, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, February 6, 2014.\n\n6\n\n\factivity six months ahead also remained positive. This gives me some hope that\nbusiness fixed investment, which has been generally lackluster during the course of the\nrecovery, will pick up somewhat this year. Indeed, we saw a nice rebound in equipment\nspending in the fourth quarter.\nInflation has been running below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent. The Fed’s\npreferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. It came in at 1.1 percent last year.\nIt is important to defend our 2 percent inflation target from both below and above. But\nI believe inflation is likely to move up. Economic growth is firming, and some of the\nfactors that have held inflation down, such as the one-time cut in payments to Medicare\nproviders, are likely to abate over time.\nAn additional and important determinant of actual inflation is consumer and business\nexpectations of inflation. I am encouraged that inflation expectations remain near their\nlonger-term averages and consistent with our 2 percent target. Thus, I anticipate, as the\nFOMC indicated in its most recent statement, that inflation will move back toward our\ntarget over time. Indeed, given the large amount of monetary accommodation we have\nadded and continue to add to the economy, I think there is some upside risk to inflation\nin the longer term.\nAlthough growth in the first quarter is likely to be somewhat slower than the rapid pace\nwe saw in the second half of last year, overall, I anticipate economic growth of around 3\npercent this year, a pace that is slightly above trend. Everyone would like to see robust\ngrowth of 5 to 6 percent, but I don’t see that happening. Nevertheless, I do see steady\nprogress and an improving economy. This growth is sufficient to result in a continued\ndecline in the unemployment rate, which should reach about 6.2 percent by the end of\n2014.\nOf course, with any forecast, there are risks. The current volatility in emerging market\ncurrencies could pose a risk if it were to spill over more broadly into other financial\n7\n\n\fmarkets. But at this point, I do not consider it a significant risk to the U.S. economy.\nWhile there continues to be some downside risks, for the first time in a few years, I see\na potential for some upside risks to the economic outlook. We need to consider this\npossibility as we calibrate monetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nThe Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary policy actions to support the economic\nrecovery. The Fed has lowered its policy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially\nzero, where it has been for more than five years. Since the policy rate cannot go any\nlower, the Fed has attempted to provide additional accommodation through large-scale\nasset purchases. We are now in our third round of this quantitative easing, or, as it is\ncommonly called, QE3. These purchases have greatly expanded the size and lengthened\nthe maturity of the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet.\nThe Fed is also using forward guidance as a policy tool, which is intended to inform the\npublic about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. In this dimension,\nthe FOMC has indicated that it intends to leave the policy rate near zero well past the\ntime that the unemployment rate falls below the 6.5 percent threshold. The FOMC had\npreviously indicated this was the earliest point at which it would consider raising\ninterest rates, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s\n2 percent target. On asset purchases, the FOMC has indicated that it will continue the\npurchases until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the\ncontext of price stability.\nYet, with the economy having improved substantially over the last year and the outlook\nbrightening, the time has come for the FOMC to slow the pace at which it is adding\nmonetary accommodation, which is to say, ease our foot off the accelerator. 2 My\n2\n\nFor more on the subject, see Charles I. Plosser, “The Outlook and the Hazards of Accelerationist Policy,”\nremarks before The University of Delaware Center for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship,\nNewark, DE, February 14, 2012.\n\n8\n\n\fpersonal view is that the process should have started sooner and proceeded more\nexpeditiously. Nevertheless, the FOMC did decide in December to take a very modest\nstep by reducing asset purchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per month, and then\nreduced this by another $10 billion to $65 billion a month in January.\nThe FOMC indicated that if incoming information broadly supports the expectation of\nongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its\nlonger-run objective, then we’ll likely reduce the pace of purchases further in measured\nsteps at future meetings. Former Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated in his December\npress conference that if we are making progress in terms of inflation and continued job\ngains, then the program would be concluded late in 2014.\nNotice that even though we are reducing the pace at which we are purchasing longerterm assets, we are still adding monetary policy accommodation. So, the foot is still on\nthe accelerator. My preference would be that we conclude the purchases sooner rather\nthan later.\nI believe a good case can be made for speeding up the pace of our taper if the economic\noutlook plays out as I expect. As I noted earlier, the unemployment rate fell 1.2\npercentage points last year, and again in January to 6.6 percent. This is a much sharper\ndecline than anticipated when we started the purchase program in September 2012.\nWe are now only one-tenth of a point from the 6.5 percent threshold in our forward\nguidance for interest rates.\nThe FOMC has indicated that it doesn’t anticipate raising rates when the economy\ncrosses that threshold. However, I do believe that we have a communications\nchallenge. We have not described how policy will be conducted after the\nunemployment rate passes 6.5 percent. Last summer, it was thought that we would\nstop asset purchases by the time unemployment reached 7 percent. Well, that didn’t\nhappen. What is the argument for continuing to increase monetary policy\naccommodation when labor market conditions are improving more quickly than\n9\n\n\fanticipated and inflation has stabilized and is projected to move back to goal? The\nlonger we continue purchases in such an environment, the more likely we will fall\nbehind the curve in reducing the extraordinary degree of monetary policy\naccommodation. With the economy awash in reserves, the costs of such a misfire could\nbe considerably higher than usual, fomenting higher inflation and perhaps financial\ninstability.\nMy preference was, and remains, to scale back our purchase program at a faster pace to\nreflect the strengthening economy. Given the falling unemployment rate, our\ncommunications should be focused on how economic conditions will determine the\ninterest rate path. Continuing to buy assets is neither helpful nor essential.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the economy is continuing to improve at a moderate pace.\nWe are likely to see growth of around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor markets\nwill continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue its decline,\nreaching 6.2 percent by the end of 2014. I also believe that inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2 percent over the\nnext year.\nOn monetary policy, we must back away from increasing the degree of policy\naccommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy. Reducing the\npace of asset purchases to $65 billion a month is moving in the right direction, but that\nmay prove to be insufficient if the economy continues to play out according to the\nFOMC forecasts. I believe the economy has met the criteria for ending the asset\npurchases as there has been significant improvement in labor market conditions. I also\nbelieve that further increases in the balance sheet are unlikely to provide appreciable\nbenefits for the recovery and may have unintended consequences. A case can be made\nfor ending the current asset purchase program sooner to reflect the improvement in the\neconomic outlook and to lessen some of the communications problems we will face\n10\n\n\fwith our forward guidance.\nEven after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary policy will still be highly\naccommodative. As the expansion gains traction, the challenge will be to reduce\naccommodation and to normalize policy in a way that ensures that inflation remains\nclose to our target, that the economy continues to grow, and that we avoid sowing the\nseeds of another financial crisis. This means the Fed still has considerable work to do.\n\n11\n\n\f"

That\nis quite a long time. While I am a lot older than when I first started giving these talks, I\ndo not feel particularly wiser. So I guess I have to keep trying until I get it right.\nYou may wonder why, after more than seven years at the Philadelphia Fed, I still look\nforward to returning to Rochester each winter. Well, it is certainly not the weather!\nAlthough, I’ll note that you certainly handle the snow better than we do in Philadelphia.\n1\n\n\fNo, it’s about friends and colleagues, and a community that remains vibrant and\npositive. So, even in the wake of the “Polar Vortex of 2014,” I am delighted to be here\nand to see old friends and familiar faces. Thank you for having me back and for such a\nwarm welcome.\nI have acquired a great deal of respect for weather forecasters over the years, especially\nin turbulent seasons, because as I have noted on many occasions, forecasting even in\ngood times can be a humbling experience. Nonetheless, I am once again going to offer\nyou a forecast for the economy as well as my views on monetary policy. I should note,\nthough, that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nLet me begin by noting that this is a special time for the Federal Reserve. We are\nobserving our 100th anniversary. The Federal Reserve Act was signed into law by\nPresident Woodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913, and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks\nopened their doors on November 16, 1914.\nTo balance political, economic, and geographic interests, Congress created the Federal\nReserve System made up of these 12 regional Reserve Banks with oversight provided by\na Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This decentralized central bank was\nstructured to overcome political and public concerns that its actions would be\ndominated either by political interests in Washington or by financial interests on Wall\nStreet.\nThe 12 Reserve Banks perform several roles. They distribute currency, act as a bankers’\nbank, and generally perform the functions of a central bank, which includes serving as\nthe bank for the U.S. Treasury. They also play a critical role in supervising many banks\nand bank holding companies.\nMoreover, the Reserve Banks ensure that the Federal Reserve stays in touch with Main\nStreet. The Reserve Banks have boards of directors, many also have Branch boards, and\nall have advisory councils that provide economic insight and information. These\n2\n\n\fcontacts allow the Reserve Banks to keep up to date and knowledgeable about\neconomic conditions in their regions. The Reserve Banks also collect data, run surveys\nof economic activity, and provide economic analyses. This rich array of information and\nthe diverse views from around the country help paint a mosaic of the economy that is\nessential as we formulate national monetary policy.\nWithin the Federal Reserve, the body that makes monetary policy decisions is the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or the FOMC. Here again, Congress has designed the\nsystem with a number of checks and balances. Since 1935, the composition of the\nFOMC has included the seven Governors in Washington, the president of the New York\nFed, and the presidents of four other Reserve Banks who serve one-year terms as\nmembers on a rotating basis.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee’s assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings a year\nto set monetary policy, and our first one in 2014 was held last week. In normal times,\nthe Committee votes to adjust short-term interest rates to achieve the goals of\nmonetary policy that Congress has set for us in the Federal Reserve Act.\nCongress established the current set of monetary policy goals in 1978. The amended\nFederal Reserve Act specifies that the FOMC “shall maintain long run growth of the\nmonetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential\nto increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment,\nstable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since moderate long-term\ninterest rates generally result when prices are stable and the economy is operating at\nfull employment, many have interpreted these instructions as being a dual mandate to\nmanage fluctuations in employment in the short run while preserving price stability in\nthe long run.\n\n3\n\n\fEconomic Conditions\nIn order to determine the appropriate monetary policy to promote these goals, the\nFOMC must monitor and assess economic developments. So, let me turn to an\nassessment of our economy.\nAs a reminder, last year at this time, I anticipated that we would see real economic\ngrowth of about 3 percent in 2013, that the unemployment rate would reach 7 percent\nin the fourth quarter, and that inflation would gradually rise toward the Fed’s target of 2\npercent. That turned out to be a “not too shabby” forecast. Real growth for the year is\ncurrently estimated at about 2.8 percent, and the unemployment rate was 7 percent for\nthe fourth quarter. Inflation has not risen as much as I thought it would, but it has\nstabilized nonetheless.\nSo let’s look at some of the details of how the year ended and the implications for the\ncoming year. The message is that the economy is on firmer footing than it has been for\nthe past several years.\nReal output grew at a 3.2 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of last year,\nfollowing a 4.1 percent growth rate in the third quarter. That means economic growth\nin the second half of 2013 was double that of the first half. Consumer spending and\nbusiness investment in equipment ended the year with strong increases. Inventory\ninvestment and net exports also contributed to growth, while a decline in residential\ninvestment and a sharp decrease in federal government spending subtracted from\ngrowth in the fourth quarter of the year. I expect that there will be less fiscal drag in\n2014 and that housing will continue its recovery.\nPersonal consumption, which accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, advanced at an\nannual rate of 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter, the highest personal consumption\ngrowth rate since fourth quarter 2010. Rising house prices and stock prices have helped\nimprove consumer balance sheets, and steady job growth has added to wage and salary\ngrowth, all of which have supported spending. The recent December employment\n4\n\n\freport showed payroll gains of 74,000 jobs, which came in below many analysts’\nexpectations. Yet, December’s number was likely affected by the unseasonably cold and\nsnowy weather, although it is not yet clear by how much. The number is also subject to\nrevision, and such revisions can be significant.\nBecause of the month-to-month volatility and data revisions, I prefer not to read too\nmuch into the most recent number but, instead, look at averages over several months,\nand here the news remains positive. Firms added an average of 182,000 jobs per month\nlast year, comparable to the pace in 2012. This consistent pace of job growth was\nenough to drop the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent in December. This means that\nthe unemployment rate fell 1.2 percentage points last year. It also ended the year at a\nlower level than the FOMC anticipated in its Summary of Economic Projections in\nSeptember 2012, when we started the current asset purchase program. That is, the\nlabor market has performed noticeably better than expected, according to the\nunemployment rate measure.\nShould we be skeptical of the unemployment rate as an indicator of labor market\nconditions? Some people are because the decline in the unemployment rate reflects\ndeclines in labor force participation as well as increases in employment. There is even\nconcern that the unemployment rate will move back up significantly when discouraged\nworkers reenter the labor force. Based on research by my staff, I am less concerned\nabout this possibility. 1\nFirst, it is important to realize that labor force participation rates have been declining\nsince 2000. The declines are driven primarily by demographic changes, most notably\nthe aging of the baby boomers. This trend is ongoing and was expected to accelerate.\nSecond, detailed analysis of the Current Population Survey’s micro data indicates that\n1\n\nShigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special\nReport, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, November 19, 2013.\n\n5\n\n\fmuch of the decline in participation since the start of the recovery can be accounted for\nby increased retirements and disability. Some of these increases might have been\ndriven by the state of the economy as some baby boomers may have moved their\nretirement decision forward after losing a job. Nevertheless, few of these individuals\nare likely to reenter the labor force. In addition, there has been an increase in the\nnumber of people out of the workforce who are going to school, which means there is\nless concern about skill depreciation for this group. So, I do expect some discouraged\nworkers to reenter the labor force as the expansion picks up, and while they search for a\njob, there could be upward pressure on the unemployment rate. Nonetheless, I believe\nthe overall unemployment rate remains the best summary statistic of labor market\nconditions.\nThe business sector is also entering the year on a positive note. At the national level,\nmanufacturing activity accelerated over the final three months of 2013. The\nPhiladelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of regional manufacturing, which is a\nreliable indicator of national manufacturing trends, also showed that manufacturing\nactivity picked up in the second half of 2013. In January, the survey’s general activity\nindex posted its eighth consecutive positive number. Expectations for manufacturing\nactivity six months ahead also remained positive. This gives me some hope that\nbusiness fixed investment, which has been generally lackluster during the course of the\nrecovery, will pick up somewhat this year. Indeed, we saw a nice rebound in equipment\nspending in the fourth quarter.\nInflation has been running below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent. The Fed’s\npreferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. It came in at 1.1 percent last year.\nIt is important to defend our 2 percent inflation target from both below and above. But\nI believe inflation is likely to firm up. Economic growth is accelerating, and some of the\nfactors that have held inflation down, such as the one-time cut in payments to Medicare\nproviders, are likely to abate over time. An additional and important determinant of\n6\n\n\factual inflation is consumer and business expectations of inflation. I am encouraged\nthat inflation expectations remain near their longer-term averages and consistent with\nour 2 percent target. Thus, I anticipate, as the FOMC indicated in its most recent\nstatement, that inflation will move back toward our target over time. Indeed, given the\nlarge amount of monetary accommodation we have added and continue to add to the\neconomy, I think there is some upside risk to inflation in the longer term.\nAlthough growth in the first quarter is likely to be somewhat slower than the rapid pace\nwe saw in the fourth quarter of last year, overall, I anticipate economic growth of\naround 3 percent this year, a pace that is slightly above trend. This is far from the\nrobust growth that many would like to see; nevertheless, it does represent steady\nprogress and an improving economy. My forecast is largely in line with those of my\ncolleagues on the FOMC, whose most recent projections saw growth in the 2.8 to 3.2\npercent range in 2014.\nGrowth will continue to lead to declines in the unemployment rate over the next year to\nabout 6.2 percent by the end of 2014. Like my forecast last year, this makes me\nsomewhat more optimistic than most of my FOMC colleagues, who reported a central\ntendency of 6.3 to 6.6 percent by the end of 2014.\nOf course, with any forecast, there are risks. The current volatility in emerging market\ncurrencies could pose a risk if it were to spill over more broadly to other financial\nmarkets. But at this point, I do not consider it a significant risk to the U.S. economy.\nWhile there continues to be some downside risks, for the first time in a few years, I see\na potential for some upside risks to the economic outlook. We need to consider this\npossibility as we calibrate monetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nOver the past five years, the Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary policy actions to\nsupport the economic recovery. The Fed has lowered its policy rate — the federal funds\nrate — to essentially zero, where it has been for more than five years. Since the policy\n7\n\n\frate cannot go any lower, the Fed has attempted to provide additional accommodation\nthrough large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing. We are now in our third\nround of these purchases, or, as it is commonly called, QE3. These purchases have\ngreatly expanded the size and lengthened the maturity of the assets on the Fed’s\nbalance sheet.\nThe Fed is also using forward guidance as a policy tool, which is intended to inform the\npublic about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. In this dimension,\nthe FOMC has indicated that it intends to leave the policy rate near zero well past the\ntime that the unemployment rate falls below the 6.5 percent threshold. The FOMC had\npreviously indicated this was the earliest point at which it would consider raising\ninterest rates, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2\npercent target. On asset purchases, the FOMC has indicated that it will continue the\npurchases until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the\ncontext of price stability.\nYet, with the economy having improved substantially over the last year and the outlook\nbrightening, the time has come for the FOMC to slow the pace at which it is adding\nmonetary accommodation, which is to say, ease our foot off the accelerator. My\npersonal view is that the process should have started sooner and proceeded more\nexpeditiously. Nevertheless, the FOMC did decide in December to take a very modest\nstep in this direction by reducing asset purchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per\nmonth, and last week’s decision reduced this by another $10 billion to $65 billion a\nmonth.\nThe FOMC indicated that if incoming information broadly supports its expectation of\nongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its\nlonger-run objective, then we’ll likely reduce the pace of purchases in further measured\nsteps at future meetings. Former Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated in his December\npress conference that if we are making progress in terms of inflation and continued job\ngains, then the program would be concluded late in 2014.\n8\n\n\fNotice that even though we are reducing the pace at which we are purchasing longerterm assets, we are still adding monetary policy accommodation. As I noted earlier, I\nbelieve the economy has already met the criteria of substantial improvement in labor\nmarket conditions, and the economic outlook has improved as well. So my preference\nwould be that we conclude the purchases sooner rather than later.\nIndeed, before the decision to taper in December, I had proposed that we set a total\namount of additional securities we planned to buy and then stop the asset purchases\nonce that amount was reached. In my view, this would have reduced policy uncertainty,\nthereby benefiting the economy. 2 In December, the FOMC announced a reduction in\nthe purchase pace, indicating that purchases were not on a preset course. The\nCommittee continued on this path in January, and while this wasn’t my preferred path, I\nsupported the action as a step in the right direction. I reasoned that by following\nthrough with another measured step to reduce purchases, the Committee was\nstrengthening the signal that the process would continue and thus it was reducing policy\nuncertainty. While I may have preferred a more aggressive scale-back, I was pleased\nthat the FOMC has taken the first two steps on the path toward ending the program.\nThat said, I believe a good case can be made for speeding up the pace of our taper if the\neconomic outlook plays out as I expect. As I noted earlier, the unemployment rate fell\n1.2 percentage points last year, to 6.7 percent in December. This was a much sharper\ndecline than anticipated when we started the purchase program in September 2012. In\nfact, back then, the central tendency of the Committee’s economic projections for\nunemployment in the fourth quarter of 2013 was 7.6 to 7.9 percent compared to the 7\npercent fourth-quarter average that the economy actually achieved. If the\nunemployment rate continues to drop at that pace, we will soon be at the 6.5 percent\nthreshold in our forward guidance for interest rates.\n\n2\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy,” remarks before the Risk Management\nAssociation, Philadelphia, PA, November 18, 2013.\n\n9\n\n\fAlthough the FOMC has indicated that it doesn’t anticipate raising rates when the\neconomy crosses that threshold, I do believe that we will have complicated our\ncommunications if we are still purchasing assets at that point. What is the argument for\ncontinuing to increase monetary policy accommodation when labor market conditions\nare improving rapidly, inflation has stabilized, and the outlook is for it to move back to\ngoal? The longer we continue purchases in such an environment, the more likely we will\nfall behind the curve in reducing the extraordinary degree of monetary policy\naccommodation. With the economy awash in reserves, the costs of such a misfire could\nbe considerably higher than usual, fomenting higher inflation and perhaps financial\ninstability.\nMy preference is to scale back our purchase program at a faster pace to reflect the\nstrengthening economy. I would like to see purchases concluded before the\nunemployment rate reaches the threshold, which is likely during the first half of the\nyear.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the economy is continuing to improve at a moderate pace.\nWe are likely to see growth of around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor markets\nwill continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue its decline,\nreaching 6.2 percent by the end of 2014. I also believe that inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2 percent over the\nnext year.\nOn monetary policy, we must begin to back away from increasing the degree of policy\naccommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy. Reducing the\npace of asset purchases to $65 billion a month is moving in the right direction, but that\nmay prove to be insufficient if the economy continues to play out according to the\nFOMC forecasts. I believe the economy has met the criteria of significant improvement\nin labor market conditions for ending the program and that further increases in the\n10\n\n\fbalance sheet are unlikely to provide appreciable benefits for the recovery. A case can\nbe made for ending the current asset purchase program sooner to reflect the\nimprovement in the economic outlook and to lessen some of the communications\nproblems we will face with our forward guidance.\nEven after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary policy will still be highly\naccommodative. As the expansion gains traction, the challenge will be to reduce\naccommodation and normalize policy in a way that ensures that inflation remains close\nto our target, that the economy continues to grow, and that we avoid sowing the seeds\nof another financial crisis.

The new year always seems like a good time to reflect on the\npast and refresh our outlook for the future, and I will try to do a bit of both today.\n\n1\n\n\fThis is a particularly noteworthy time in the history of the Federal Reserve. On\nDecember 23, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the act that created the\nFederal Reserve System. Thus, the Fed’s official 100th anniversary occurred just three\nweeks ago.\nSo, I thought I would begin by sharing a brief history of our nation’s central bank with\nyou before discussing my views on economic conditions and monetary policy.\nBefore I begin, though, I should note that my views are not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nA Historical Look at a Decentralized Fed\nWhat better place to share a little history of our central bank than here in Philadelphia\nand in this historic venue of the Union League. Just a few blocks from where the\nPhiladelphia Fed stands on Independence Mall, you will find vestiges of two earlier\nattempts to create a central bank for the United States, dating back to the time\nPhiladelphia was the nation’s major financial and political center.\nThe first institution was the brainchild of our first Treasury secretary, Alexander\nHamilton. His efforts led to the creation of the First Bank of the United States, which\nwas awarded a 20-year charter by Congress in 1791.\nAlthough the First Bank’s charter was not renewed, the War of 1812 and the ensuing\ninflation and economic turmoil convinced Congress to establish the Second Bank of the\nUnited States. It was also given a 20-year charter and operated from 1816 to 1836.\nHowever, its charter was not renewed — Congress could not override the veto of\nPresident Andrew Jackson, who led the opposition to the central bank. Public distrust of\ncentralized power was an important factor in the demise of both banks. Both became\nentangled in politics, and both failed to gain the public’s confidence and establish the\n\n2\n\n\findependence necessary to serve our vast and diverse country of bakers and bankers,\nfarmers and financiers, and manufacturers and merchants.\nIt took Congress nearly 80 years to try again to establish a central bank. This time\nCongress and President Wilson agreed upon a uniquely American governance structure\n— a decentralized, central bank.\nTo balance political, economic, and geographic interests, Congress created the Federal\nReserve System made up of regional Reserve Banks with oversight provided by a Board\nof Governors in Washington, D.C.\nThis structure helped to overcome political and public opposition stemming from fears\nthat a central bank would be dominated either by political interests in Washington or by\nfinancial interests on Wall Street.\nThe Federal Reserve Act formed a Reserve Bank Organization Committee to divide the\ncountry into no fewer than eight and no more than 12 Federal Reserve Districts.\nAlmost immediately after the law was enacted, the committee started receiving letters\nand telegrams from local business owners, bankers, farmers, and others, who were all\nmaking a case for where they wanted a Reserve Bank to be located.\nThe committee held meetings in 18 cities before submitting a report to Congress in April\n1914, naming the final 12 cities and districts. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nwas designated as the regional Reserve Bank for the Third District, an area that includes\nDelaware, the eastern two-thirds of Pennsylvania, and the southern half of New Jersey.\nThese Reserve Banks distribute currency, act as a bankers’ bank, and generally perform\nthe functions of a central bank, which includes serving as the bank for the U.S. Treasury.\nThe 12 regional Reserve Banks are deeply rooted in our nation’s communities, which\nensure that the Federal Reserve stays in touch with Main Street. The Reserve Banks all\nhave boards of directors, many also have Branch boards, and all have advisory councils\n3\n\n\fand other mechanisms to keep abreast of conditions in their regional economies. This\nrich array of information and the diverse views from around the country contribute to a\nmosaic of the economy that is essential as we formulate national monetary policy.\nOf course, most people associate the Fed with the determination of monetary policy.\nWithin the Federal Reserve, the body that makes monetary policy decisions is the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or the FOMC. Here again, Congress has designed the\nsystem with a number of checks and balances. Since 1935, the composition of the\nFOMC has included the seven Governors in Washington, the president of the New York\nFed, and the presidents of four other Reserve Banks who serve one-year terms as\nmembers on a rotating basis.\nOne important role of the independent regional Reserve Banks is to ensure that diverse\nviews are represented. The Reserve Banks each have economic research departments\nto guarantee that a wide variety of perspectives are brought to the table. In this way,\nthe institution avoids groupthink. By being open and transparent about these various\nperspectives, the decentralized model for the Federal Reserve helps strengthen public\nconfidence and preserve its independence.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee’s assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings a year\nto set monetary policy. It discusses economic conditions and, in normal times, adjusts\nshort-term interest rates to achieve the goals of monetary policy that Congress has set\nfor us in the Federal Reserve Act.\nCongress established the current set of monetary policy goals in 1978. The amended\nFederal Reserve Act specifies that the FOMC “shall maintain long run growth of the\nmonetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential\nto increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment,\nstable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since moderate long-term\n4\n\n\finterest rates generally result when prices are stable and the economy is operating at\nfull employment, many have interpreted these instructions as being a dual mandate to\nmanage fluctuations in employment in the short run while preserving price stability in\nthe long run.\nEconomic Conditions\nIn order to determine the appropriate monetary policy to promote these goals, the\nFOMC must monitor economic developments. So, let me turn to an assessment of our\neconomy. As we enter 2014, I think the bottom line is that the economy is on firmer\nfooting than it has been for the past several years.\nReal output grew at a 4.1 percent annual pace in the third quarter of last year, the\nstrongest gain in nearly two years and a marked acceleration from the first half of 2013.\nSome of this growth came in the form of inventory investment, which is volatile and is\nless likely to have contributed as much to growth in the fourth quarter. Still, personal\nconsumption and fixed investment provided positive contributions, and economic\nprospects at the end of last year and the beginning of this year are positive.\nPersonal consumption, which accounts more than two-thirds of GDP, advanced at an\nannual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter. Some observers have lamented at the lack\nof stronger growth in consumption. But I would note that consumption growth has not\nfluctuated that much over the course of the recovery. I am encouraged by the U.S.\nconsumers’ persistence in the face of many challenges, including a payroll tax hike last\nJanuary, a government shutdown, significant uncertainties about future tax policy, and\nthe implications of health-care reform.\nConsistent job growth has added to wage and salary growth, which has supported\nspending. The December employment report released last Friday, which showed payroll\ngains of 74,000 jobs, came in below many analysts’ expectations. Yet, I caution you not\nto read too much into one month’s number. December’s number was likely affected by\n\n5\n\n\fthe unseasonably cold and snowy weather, although it is not yet clear by how much.\nThe number is also subject to revision, and such revisions can be significant.\nBecause of the month-to-month volatility and data revisions, I prefer not to read too\nmuch into the most recent number but, instead, look at averages over several months,\nand here the news remains positive. Firms added an average of 182,000 jobs per month\nlast year, comparable to the pace in 2012. This consistent pace of job growth was\nenough to drop the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent in December. This means that\nthe unemployment rate fell 1.2 percentage points last year, and, importantly, it is at a\nlower level than the FOMC anticipated it would be at this point when we started the\ncurrent asset purchase program in September 2012. That is, the labor market has\nperformed noticeably better than expected, according to the unemployment rate\nmeasure.\nSome people, however, feel that the decline in the unemployment rate overstates the\ndegree of progress being made in labor markets because it reflects declines in labor\nforce participation as well as increases in employment. There is even concern that the\nunemployment rate will move back up significantly when discouraged workers reenter\nthe labor force. Based on research by my staff, I am less concerned about this\npossibility. 1\nFirst, it is important to realize that labor force participation rates have been declining\nsince 2000. The declines are driven mostly by demographic changes, including the aging\nof the baby boomers. This trend is ongoing and was expected to accelerate.\nSecond, detailed analysis of the Current Population Survey’s micro data indicates that\nmuch of the decline in participation since the start of the recovery can be accounted for\n1\n\nShigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special\nReport, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, November 19, 2013.\n\n6\n\n\fby increased retirements and disability. Some of these increases might have been\ndriven by the state of the economy as some baby boomers perhaps moved their\nretirement decision forward after losing a job. Nevertheless, few of these former\nindividuals are likely to reenter the labor force. In addition, there has been an increase\nin the number of people out of the workforce who are going to school, which means\nthere is less concern about skill depreciation for these people. So while I do expect\nsome discouraged workers to reenter the labor force as the expansion picks up and\nwhile they search for a job there could be upward pressure on the unemployment rate, I\nwould not overinterpret the decline in participation as a lack of progress made in labor\nmarket conditions or as a problem that must be corrected. There are fundamental\nchanges in the structure of the labor market that are likely real and sustained.\nThe progress in the labor market has led to growth in household income. In addition to\nincome growth, household balance sheets have strengthened as well. Overall\nhousehold wealth, in nominal terms, advanced 11 percent year over year through the\nthird quarter. The improving housing market has been an important contributor to that\ngrowth, with owners’ equity in real estate surging 29 percent in 2013 over 2012. House\nprices are rising; the number of homeowners with underwater mortgages and the\nnumber of mortgage delinquencies are down. I expect these improvements will help to\nsupport consumer spending going forward.\nBusiness balance sheets are also healthy. Industrial production was very encouraging in\nNovember, when it advanced 1.1 percent on gains in all major categories. That growth\nwas the most rapid in 12 months and brought the overall index higher than its\nprerecession peak for the first time. The Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of\nregional manufacturing, which is a reliable indicator of national manufacturing trends,\nhas also been in positive territory for seven months, and our firms expect continued\nexpansion in manufacturing activity over the next six months. This gives me some hope\nthat business fixed investment, which has been generally lackluster during the course of\nthe recovery, will pick up somewhat this year.\n7\n\n\fInflation has been running below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent. The year-overyear change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation,\nis the Fed’s preferred measure. It has drifted downward over the past year to about 0.9\npercent in November. Core PCE, a measure that removes food and energy prices that\ntend to be volatile, was a bit higher at 1.1 percent. I believe we must defend our 2percent inflation target from below and above. However, I believe inflation is likely to\nfirm up as some of the factors that have held it down, such as the cut in payments to\nMedicare providers and generally weak medical costs, are likely to abate over time. I\nam encouraged that inflation expectations remain near their longer-term averages and\nconsistent with our 2-percent target. So, I anticipate, as the FOMC indicated in its most\nrecent statement, that inflation will move back toward our target over time. Indeed,\ngiven the large amount of monetary accommodation we have added and continue to\nadd to the economy, I think that there is some upside risk to inflation in the longer term.\nI anticipate overall economic growth of around 3 percent this year, a pace that is slightly\nabove trend. This is far from the robust growth that many would like to see;\nnevertheless, it does represent steady progress and an improving economy. My\nforecast is largely in line with those of my colleagues on the FOMC, whose most recent\nprojections had a central tendency of growth of 2.2 to 2.3 percent for 2013, and\naccelerating to 2.8 to 3.2 percent in 2014.\nI believe this growth will continue to lead to declines in the unemployment rate over the\nnext year and should result in an unemployment rate of about 6.2 percent by the end of\n2014. This makes me somewhat more optimistic than most of my FOMC colleagues,\nwho reported a central tendency of 6.3 to 6.6 percent by the end of 2014.\nMonetary Policy\nSo, let me turn to some observations about monetary policy. Over the past five years,\nthe Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary actions to support the economic recovery.\nThe Fed has lowered its policy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially zero,\n8\n\n\fwhere it has been for more than five years. Since the policy rate cannot go any lower,\nthe Fed has attempted to provide additional accommodation through large-scale asset\npurchases, or quantitative easing. We are now in our third round of these purchases, or\nQE3. These purchases have greatly expanded the size and lengthened the maturity of\nthe assets on the Fed’s balance sheet.\nThe Fed is also using forward guidance as a policy tool, which is intended to inform the\npublic about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. In its December\nstatement, the FOMC indicated that it intends to leave the policy rate near zero well\npast the time that the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent, especially if\nprojected inflation continues to run below the FOMC’s 2-percent target.\nOn asset purchases, the FOMC has indicated that it will continue the purchases until the\noutlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the context of price stability.\nThe Fed has structured its latest round of asset purchases as a flow-based program, with\nthe idea that policymakers could fine-tune the rate of purchases in response to the\neconomy.\nThe FOMC decided in December to reduce the purchases from $85 billion to $75 billion\nper month. Thus, we are still adding monetary accommodation but at a slightly slower\npace. Asset purchases are not on a preset course and will continue to be contingent on\nthe FOMC’s economic outlook. However, the FOMC did indicate in December that if\neconomic conditions evolve as expected, with improved labor market conditions and\ninflation moving back toward its goal, then the FOMC will likely reduce the pace of asset\npurchases in measured steps at future meetings. Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated in\nhis December press conference that if we are making progress in terms of inflation and\ncontinued job gains, then the program would be concluded late in 2014. The December\nemployment report has not changed my belief that the economy has already met the\ncriteria of substantial improvement in labor market conditions. So my preference would\nbe that we conclude the purchases sooner than this, but I am glad that we have taken\nthe first step on the path to ending the program.\n9\n\n\fEventually, monetary policy will be normalized, but the way in which that is done will\ndepend on what operating framework we plan to use in the normalized environment. I\nbelieve that the exit strategy principles laid out by the FOMC in June 2011 still apply.\nMore specifically, we need to return to an operating framework in which a market\ninterest rate is our policy instrument. We also should shrink the size of our balance\nsheet, which is now about $4 trillion, and return to an all-Treasuries portfolio as part of\nthe normalization process.\nThis sounds easy in principle, but I believe the size and composition of our balance sheet\nwill make it challenging to execute smoothly.\nThere are now more than $2.4 trillion of excess reserves in the banking system. These\nreserves are not inflationary until they are converted to money and flow out into the\neconomy.\nBut as market rates rise in an improving economy, banks will find it advantageous to\nbegin to increase lending or acquire assets using their reserves. The challenge for the\nFed is to control the flow of reserves so that we can successfully maintain our 2-percent\ninflation target. This may require raising interest rates more quickly than currently\nanticipated. We have the tools that would enable us to raise rates if we chose to do so.\nHowever, the Fed may be subject to political pressures or pushback from various\ninterest-sensitive sectors that could result in a more measured response than required.\nOne of the consequences would be higher inflation. History suggests that the Fed tends\nto be behind the curve when it comes time to tighten monetary policy, and in the\ncurrent environment, that delay could prove to be more costly than when reserves are\nin limited supply. Thus, it’s a matter of our will rather than our ability.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the economy is continuing to improve at a moderate pace.\nWe are likely to see growth of around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor markets\n10\n\n\fwill continue to improve gradually, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue its\ndecline to 6.2 percent by the end of 2014. I also believe that inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2 percent over the\nnext year.\nOn monetary policy, the reduction in asset purchases from $85 billion a month to $75\nbillion a month is a step in the right direction. I believe the economy has met the\ncriteria of significant improvement in labor market conditions for ending the program\nand that further increases in the balance sheet are unlikely to provide appreciable\nbenefits for recovery. Even after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary\npolicy will still be highly accommodative.\nThe work of the Fed, however, is far from over. Monetary policy still faces considerable\nchallenges as we seek to normalize policy. The task should be to return to a framework\nin which a market rate is our primary policy tool, to reduce the size of our balance sheet,\nand to restore our portfolio to all Treasuries. The challenge will be to do so in a way\nthat ensures that inflation remains close to our target, that the economy continues to\ngrow, and that we avoid sowing the seeds of another financial crisis.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fShocks, Gaps, and Monetary Policy\nKAEA-Maekyung Forum\nKorea-America Economic Association\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJanuary 4, 2014\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHighlights:\n• President Charles Plosser notes there are several different ways to interpret the economic dynamics\nduring the recent recession and recovery. Some view the shocks hitting the economy as transitory\nand potential GDP as stable. Others view the shocks as being more permanent, affecting both\nactual and potential output. Those perspectives would call for different policy responses.\n• President Plosser says this is one of the reasons why monetary policymakers should think in terms of\npolicies that are likely to be robust across many models and perspectives.\n• He advocates that systematic policymaking seems to be the most promising approach, because it\ntends to be more transparent and minimizes the degree to which data mismeasurement and model\nuncertainty affect policy.\n\nI want to thank Bang Jeon, president of the Korea-America Economic Association (KAEA), who is\non the faculty here at Drexel University, and Yongsung Chang, vice president of the KAEA, who\nis on the faculty at the University of Rochester, for inviting me to speak to this forum. The KAEA\nhas hosted a number of prominent speakers in recent years at its annual meetings, and so it is a\npleasure and an honor to speak to you this evening.\nMuch has happened in the field of macroeconomics and monetary policy in the past seven\nyears since I left Rochester to join the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Today I want to\nhighlight some key features of the recent recession and the recovery and to discuss how they\nhave influenced my views on monetary policymaking. Before I begin, though, I would like to\npoint out that my views are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fThe challenges presented by the recession and recovery have illustrated why policymakers\nmust have a framework that provides a basis for their policy judgments. We say that our\npolicymaking is data dependent, but without a lens through which we view economic data, it is\nimpossible to interpret those data in any sort of useful way, particularly as they pertain to\npolicy. However, policymakers also must approach their task with a great deal of humility. The\nlens through which we look is often foggy and lacking focus. There is still much we do not\nunderstand about recent events, and I am mindful that further research is likely to bring more\nclarity to the narrative and to our ability to make more informed policy decisions going forward.\nAfter all, economists are still debating the events surrounding the Great Depression threequarters of a century after it ended. Indeed, I would argue that none of us have the economic\ntheory exactly right. That is why I believe it is useful and important that policy discussions\ninclude a healthy debate with different perspectives clearly represented. There are many\ndifferent interpretations of recent events, each with strengths and weakness and it is unlikely\nthat economists will converge to a common or shared understanding of these events anytime\nsoon. Unfortunately, this is not just a characteristic of the current economic environment – it is\nthe typical state of affairs – and it is one of the reasons I believe it is important for monetary\npolicymakers to think in terms of policies that are likely to be robust across many models and\nperspectives.\nThe Traditional View of Shocks and Gaps\nI want to organize my comments today around “shocks” and “gaps.” I find this to be a simple\nbut useful way to highlight some different perspectives and their implications. For example,\neconomists have different views about the nature of the shocks that sent the economy into\nrecession and about the dynamics of the economy in response to those shocks. Those\ndynamics are summarized by the economic models or frameworks economists use to interpret\nincoming data. As a policymaker, I think it is impossible to determine the right course of policy\nwithout an assessment of the nature of the shocks and a framework or implicit model for the\neconomy.\n\n2\n\n\fOne way to characterize some of the key differences in models is to view how the models\nassess departures from some concept of ideal or desirable outcomes. The concept could be a\nsteady state, some notion of economic potential, or the economic efficient outcome.\nDepartures of the economy from these ideal outcomes can be viewed as gaps. Of course, to\nthe extent that the ideal outcomes are model dependent, the gaps would also depend on the\nmodel one is using.\nAccording to one perspective, which I’ll call the traditional view, shocks hitting the economy are\nlargely transitory and dissipate rather quickly over time. Negative shocks can then give rise to\nsomething called a negative output gap – a level of output that is lower than the level\nconsistent with the economy operating at its full potential. Such a gap then becomes an object\nthat policy seeks to close or eliminate. In some models, this negative output gap also acts to\ndampen inflation.\nThink about the recent recession. Some economists and policymakers characterize the shock\nthat hit financial markets as a temporary, albeit large, aggregate demand shock. This shock gave\nrise to a large “output gap,” sometimes referred to as slack, which, in turn, is working to keep\ninflation low. According to this view, the large output gap and low inflation justify keeping\ninterest rates near zero for a long time. The belief is that low rates will help to close the output\ngap by increasing the growth of demand and thus output, which will reduce slack and allow\ninflation to move back to target. In this perspective, there are headwinds that are temporarily\nrestraining economic growth, but these can be offset with aggressive monetary\naccommodation.\nAn Alternative View of Shocks and Gaps\nBut there is an alternative interpretation. Let’s look at a rather simple, but I think useful,\nfigure. 1 The figure shows the level of real GDP as well as various vintages of potential GDP\nestimated by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO defines potential GDP as a\n\n1\n\nSee figure below.\n\n3\n\n\f“measure of the economy’s maximum sustainable output, in which the intensity of resource\nuse is neither adding to nor subtracting from inflationary pressure.” 2 Such a definition\nobviously has embedded in it some implicit assumptions about an underlying economic model,\nbut I will return to this point shortly.\nI would like to draw your attention to two noteworthy features. First, during the recession,\nGDP fell sharply, as we all know. But since the end of the recession in June 2009, the economy\nhas continued to grow at roughly the same pace as it grew before the recession. There has\nbeen little evidence of the rapid growth required to return the economy to the path of\npotential GDP as estimated by the CBO in 2007. While that may still happen, there has not\nbeen the V-shaped recovery to date anticipated by many. The shock that hit the economy\nappears to have had very persistent, if not permanent, effects. From a statistical perspective,\nthe economy appears to have taken a permanent hit to the output level.\nThe second noteworthy feature illustrated in the figure is that the CBO has revised its estimate\nof the path of potential GDP numerous times since the beginning of the recession. Specifically,\nalmost every year since 2007, it has revised down potential GDP. I am showing only three\nvintages here as an example. If you look at the “gap,” or the difference between the actual\nlevel of GDP – measured as of February 2013 when the latest CBO estimate of potential was\nreleased – and estimated potential, it is about half the size that it would have been if the path\nof potential GDP had not been revised. The gap is closing not because GDP has rebounded\ntoward the earlier estimates of potential – but because potential GDP has fallen. And this has\noccurred in spite of aggressive policies – especially monetary policy – that were intended to\nboost economic growth rates.\nSo, what might one infer from these observations? I want to offer a perspective based on some\nempirical research that Charles Nelson and I published in the Journal of Monetary Economics\n\nCongressional Budget Office, “A Summary of Alternative Methods for Estimating Potential GDP,” Background\nPaper, March 2004, p. 1.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\fover three decades ago. 3 In that paper, we concluded that real output contained important\nstochastic trends. A stochastic trend is often characterized as a random walk. A particular\nfeature of a random walk is that it doesn’t exhibit any mean reversion. It means that the\nstochastic shocks that drive such a series accumulate. Put another way, each shock is\npermanently embodied in the level of the series – there is little tendency to return to a previous\ntrend line. Such shocks are the antithesis of transitory, or what some refer to as cyclical, shocks\nthat, by definition, dissipate over time.\nIn our analysis, Nelson and I assumed that the economy was buffeted by a mixture of\npermanent and transitory shocks. Such a framework is not unusual and is compatible with the\ntype of permanent and transitory distinction stressed in Milton Friedman’s permanent income\nhypothesis. 4 More generally, in dynamic models, forward-looking agents’ responses to\npermanent shocks can be quite different from their responses to transitory shocks. For\nexample, in the permanent income framework, agents adjust consumption much more in\nresponse to changes in permanent income than to temporary changes in income. Our\nstatistical analysis found that a large portion of the fluctuations in real GDP were the result of\nshocks to the stochastic trend, that is, permanent shocks. Interestingly, the recent recession\nsaw a marked drop in consumption. Some of this decline may have been due to credit\nconstraints that became binding on some consumers. But some of the decline likely reflected\nthe fact that many consumers now perceived that their permanent income had fallen, so they\nreduced their level of consumption.\nLooking at the figure, we see that the behavior of the GDP suggests that in the recent recession,\nthe U.S. economy sustained what appears to be a permanent or at least highly persistent shock\nto the supply side of the economy that has lowered the level of GDP – although not necessarily\nits growth rate. One could contemplate numerous hypotheses about the nature of such a\nshock. In 2009, I put forward the idea that the crisis and recession were caused by a shock that\n3\n\nCharles R. Nelson and Charles I. Plosser, “Trends and Random Walks in Macroeconomic Time Series: Some\nEvidence and Implications,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 10 (1982), pp. 139–162.\n\n4\n\nMilton Friedman, A Theory of the Consumption Function, Princeton: Princeton University Press (1957).\n\n5\n\n\flikely had either permanent or very long-lasting consequences for the economy. I suggested\nthat the financial crisis may have precipitated a permanent or highly persistent decline in the\noutput of financial intermediation. I have also considered the possibility that the collapse in\nhouse values could be viewed as a permanent loss of wealth affecting household balance\nsheets. Either of these disturbances would require significant real adjustments in the\neconomy. 5\nIf we view the shock we experienced as largely permanent in nature, in contrast to being largely\ntransitory, then it alters the way we should think about gaps and about the policy responses,\nparticularly appropriate monetary policy. If you accept the idea that money is neutral in the\nlong run, then efforts to use monetary policy to offset such permanent shocks and to close\nwhat appears to be a gap will likely be ineffective and perhaps even counterproductive. The\nreal economy must ultimately adjust to such permanent shocks. Monetary policy cannot offset\nthe costs or the necessity of such real adjustments, and so it is unlikely to be an effective\nstabilization tool.\nLooking at the figure again, we see the repeated downward revision in the estimate of potential\nGDP suggests that the CBO is gradually recognizing that the fall in output was most likely a\npermanent or at least highly persistent shock to the supply side of the economy. In other\nwords, the CBO’s measures of potential output now recognize that the shock that hit the\neconomy damaged the productive potential of the economy in a persistent way, as potential\nGDP is now lower as far out as 2020. Therefore, the output gap is no longer what we thought it\nwas – it has been revised down over time. One can wonder whether five years from now the\nCBO’s potential GDP estimates will gradually converge with the existing growth path of real\nGDP. At that point, the output gap will have been gradually revised away.\nThe constant revision of estimates of potential output and thus of the output gap also\nunderscore one of the difficulties policymakers have in trying to use gaps as a guide to\n5\n\nCharles Plosser, “A Perspective on the Outlook, Output Gaps, and Price Stability,” speech presented to Money\nMarketeers, New York, May 21, 2009.\n\n6\n\n\fpolicymaking in real time. Indeed, Athanasios Orphanides and Simon van Norden have argued\nthat a major problem that gave rise to the great inflation of the 1970s was the\nmismeasurement of the perceived output gap. 6 They explained how the Fed consistently relied\non estimated output gaps that were subsequently revised and ended up being much smaller\nthan initially thought. They argue that policymakers’ reliance on estimated gaps led to overly\nexpansionary monetary policy and the resulting high rates of inflation.\nThere is a separate and perhaps more challenging issue. While a permanent shock to the level\nof GDP is disturbing enough, it would be even worse if the underlying growth rate of the\neconomy were to slow. Economists normally think that the longer-run growth rate of the\neconomy is roughly the sum of the growth rate of the labor force and the growth rate of\nproductivity. Here again, monetary policy would not be an effective tool to address such real\neconomic challenges as slower labor force or productivity growth. Appropriate policies would\nrequire focusing on increasing productivity and the quality of the labor force, not on traditional\ncountercyclical monetary policy.\nAlternative Concepts for the Gap\nTo this point, I’ve talked about the traditional view and an alternative view of the nature of the\nshock the economy experienced and how these views change the nature of the gap and the\nappropriate monetary policy response. But as I mentioned at the outset, there are different\nways to approach the standard to which economic performance is measured. In particular, we\nneed to remember that economic theory does not give us a unique way to define gaps.\nDifferent models can offer different conceptual approaches to the gap.\nFor example, as I mentioned earlier, implicit in the CBO’s approach to constructing potential\nGDP is a model of the economy and the concept of a noninflationary maximum level of output.\nOne feature of the CBO’s construct of potential, and many others’, is that potential output\nmoves very slowly and very smoothly. This means that potential GDP does not – indeed,\n6\n\nAthanasios Orphanides and Simon van Norden, “The Reliability of Inflation Based on Output Gap Estimates in\nReal Time,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 37 (2005), pp. 583–601.\n\n7\n\n\fcannot – respond much to current shocks to the economy regardless of their magnitude or\nsource, especially in real time.\nThis is in contrast to research Nelson and I conducted that revealed that a significant proportion\nof the variability in GDP was due to permanent or very long-lasting shocks. While our statistical\napproach was not based on an economic model, there is good reason to believe that shocks\nthat give rise to permanent changes in GDP should be viewed differently from those that give\nrise to purely transitory movements, especially in terms of their policy prescriptions. Measures\nthat arbitrarily, or by assumption, assign the bulk of fluctuation in GDP to purely temporary\nfactors may provide poor policy guidance when shocks are more permanent in nature.\nA different conceptual approach to defining a gap is implied by a class of economic models in\nwide use today – the new Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE, models.\nDSGE models explicitly posit that firms have some pricing power; that is, there is imperfect\ncompetition so that a firm can choose to sell more of its output by lowering its price or to sell\nless of its output by raising its price, and the firm will set its price at a markup over marginal\ncost to maximize its profits. DSGE models also assume that firms are able to only adjust prices\ninfrequently. This form of sticky prices, together with imperfect competition, allow monetary\npolicy to have real effects in the short run, while remaining neutral for the real side of the\neconomy in the long run. The sticky prices generate distortions that mean allocations and\noutput can be inefficient in the face of shocks. In these models, the efficient level of output is\nthe level of output that would prevail in the absence of the sticky prices and other market\nimperfections that allow deviations from perfect competition.\nIn this framework, the relevant output gap to be addressed is the difference between the\nefficient level and that level generated by the distortion introduced by the sticky prices and\nmarket imperfections. The behavior of the efficient level of output is unlikely to be a smooth or\na slowly evolving series like the CBO concept. In fact, it could be quite volatile and may bear\nlittle or no resemblance to the traditional concept of potential used by the CBO and others.\nEfficient output would be altered by changes in technology that affect productivity or changes\nin agents’ preferences. The role of monetary policy in these models is to react to economic\n8\n\n\fconditions in a way that minimizes the potential for distortions arising from the price stickiness\nor other market imperfections. The general policy prescription is to minimize the gap between\noutput and the efficient level of output. In the absence of unexpected events that lead firms to\nchange their desired markups over marginal cost, or other real rigidities like real wage rigidities,\nthis would be equivalent to stabilizing inflation. 7\nA great deal of work is being done on this class of models. For example, many researchers are\nattempting to build richer models that have a more elaborate financial sector in light of the\nrecent financial crisis, and they are incorporating frictions of various kinds. Regardless of how\nthese models are enhanced, their concept of the gap will continue to be a deviation of output\nfrom the efficient level that would prevail in the absence of nominal rigidities and market\nimperfections. Therefore, the gap in these models will remain conceptually different from a\ngap based on potential output. And there is no reason to believe that the policy prescriptions\nbased on these gaps will be the same. Indeed, the nature of the shock will be an important\ndeterminant in whether the efficient output level changes and whether monetary policy should\nreact or not.\nConclusion\nPolicymakers need a framework with which to evaluate incoming data in order to set\nappropriate monetary policy. But the recession and recovery have underscored that we must\nremain humble about our degree of understanding of the economy and that we must entertain\nvarious perspectives in setting policy. As I’ve discussed, there are several different ways to\ninterpret the economic dynamics we have seen in recent years, and those perspectives would\ncall for different policy responses. Some view the shocks hitting the economy as transitory and\npotential GDP as stable. Others view the shocks as being more permanent, affecting both\nactual and potential output.\n\n7\n\nSee Jordi Gali and Olivier Blanchard, “Real Wage Rigidities and the New Keynesian Model,” Journal of Money,\nCredit and Banking, 39 (2007), pp. 35–65 and Aubhik Khan, Robert G. King, and Alexander L. Wolman, “Optimal\nMonetary Policy,” Review of Economic Studies, 70 (2003), pp. 825–860.\n\n9\n\n\fIn addition, there are alternative concepts of the output gap itself, some of which focus on the\nefficient level of output instead of potential output. Each of these perspectives has some merit\nas well as drawbacks, and it will be some time (if ever) when we will know which perspective is\nthe correct one in explaining our recent economic experience.\nThis state of affairs has led me to be skeptical of relying on gaps in general as well as optimal\ncontrol exercises that are derived from specific models. Instead, I have long advocated that we\nshould think in terms of robust policies that yield good economic outcomes across a variety of\nmodels and frameworks. 8 In my view, a robust, systematic approach to policy, which is\ntransparent and minimizes the degree to which data mismeasurement and model uncertainty\naffect policy is the most promising approach to the uncertainties facing policymakers in real\ntime.\n\n8\n\nCharles Plosser, “Output Gaps and Robust Policy Rules,” speech presented to the 2010 European Banking and\nFinancial Forum, Czech National Bank, Prague, the Czech Republic, March 23, 2010.\n\n10\n\n\f11\n\n\f"

It is a pleasure to see so many familiar faces and to welcome those who are\nattending our forum for the first time.\nThis is our 10th Policy Forum, and as you can see from the program, this is a special occasion.\nThe Federal Reserve will officially begin its centennial year on December 23rd. On that date in\n1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the act that created the Federal Reserve\nSystem. The 12 Reserve Banks officially opened their doors on November 16, 1914. In\nachieving this milestone, it seems appropriate to take a step back, reflect on our central bank’s\nhistory, and seek a better understanding of its successes and its failures.\n\n1\n\n\fOne of our objectives today is to highlight specific historical episodes to see how they have\ninfluenced or shaped the evolution of the institution itself. Like the Nobel Prize-winning\neconomist Douglass North, I think institutions matter. In particular, I believe the institutional\nstructure of the central bank matters. The central bank’s goals and objectives, its policy\nframework, and its governance structure all play a part in its performance.\nGiven the historical perspective we want to take, what better place to begin than here in\nPhiladelphia, the birthplace of our nation, both politically and economically. And we can start\nby looking at the earliest attempts to create a central bank for the United States.\nThe first institution was the brainchild of our first Treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton. His\nefforts led to the creation of the First Bank of the United States, which was awarded a 20-year\ncharter by Congress in 1791. Although the First Bank’s charter was not renewed, the War of\n1812 and the ensuing inflation and economic turmoil convinced Congress to establish the\nSecond Bank of the United States, which operated from 1816 to 1836. However, it too did not\nwin a renewed charter, with President Andrew Jackson leading the opponents in a heated\npolitical debate. I believe that both these institutions failed because they were unsuccessful in\novercoming the public’s mistrust of centralized power and special interests. Indeed, without\npublic confidence in these institutions, they were doomed.\nLike many of our nation’s earliest institutions, the vestiges of both the First and Second Banks\nare located just a few blocks from where we now sit. The First Bank is located near Third and\nChestnut streets, and the Second Bank is directly across the street from the hotel where some\nof you are staying, near Fourth and Chestnut streets.\nAfter the first two attempts, it took nearly 80 years before Congress tried again to establish a\ncentral bank. The outcome was a new central bank with a governance structure designed to\ndecentralize authority and promote public confidence — a decentralized central bank. This\nstructure helped overcome political and public opposition that stemmed from fears that a\ncentral bank would be dominated either by political interests in Washington or by financial\n\n2\n\n\finterests in New York. Yet even this structure, which has now lasted a century, has evolved,\nand the balance of power has shifted over time in response to economic events and legislation.\nI believe that the fundamental concept of a decentralized central bank has great merit, in part,\nbecause it helps to preserve the independence and maintain the public trust in the institution.\nIndependence is essential if a central bank is to play its fundamental role in preserving the\npurchasing power of a fiat currency. History is replete with examples of governments using the\npower to print money as a substitute for making tough fiscal choices, and the results were\ndisastrous.\nBut, of course, a central bank can never be completely independent, nor should it be. In a\ndemocracy, independence should come with constraints and limits on the central bank’s\nauthority and scope of activities. The power to print money is a significant one, and central\nbanks should be limited in how they can use that power. Such constraints can help build public\ntrust and instill credibility in the institution. For me, trust and credibility are essential features\nfor a successful central bank. In the spirit of Douglass North’s work, I believe we should seek\nways to ensure that these qualities are embodied in the institution itself.\nOur program today will be a fascinating one. We have a distinguished array of economic\nhistorians, monetary policy experts, and former policymakers. The goal is to review the history\nof the central banking experience in the United States, beginning with the Second Bank. We\nhave organized the sessions to focus on critical economic and legislative events that have\nshaped our central bank. We are particularly pleased to have former Chairman Alan Greenspan\nand former Vice Chair Don Kohn to close our program. This will undoubtedly be a lively and\nthought-provoking day. And I hope you will find it as instructive and fascinating as I will.\nAs I already mentioned, Philadelphia has a rich history in the political and economic founding of\nour country. Before we begin, I would like to recognize one guest in the audience. In our first\nsession, we will hear about the legacy of the Second Bank of the United States. Many of you\nknow that the president of the Second Bank was Nicholas Biddle. We are pleased to have with\nus today the great-great-great-granddaughter — I think that is the right number of greats — of\n3\n\n\fNicholas Biddle, Cordelia Frances Biddle. Cordelia is actually my neighbor. She is an author and\nactress who is fascinated with history, particularly the history of Philadelphia. She has done\nresearch in our library here at the Philadelphia Fed while writing a book on another of her\nancestors, the financier and founder of Drexel University, Anthony Drexel. Cordelia, thank you\nfor joining us today.\nAnd thank all of you for coming. Let’s get the program started.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy\nRisk Management Association\nNovember 18, 2013\nPhiladelphia, PA\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHighlights:\n• President Charles Plosser provides his economic outlook and reports that since there is little\nevidence that additional asset purchases will improve economic recovery, the time has\ncome to phase out the purchase program.\n• He indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) missed an excellent\nopportunity to begin this tapering process in September, which illustrates just how difficult\nit will be to initiate any steps toward normalization of monetary policy.\n• He also suggests the FOMC should communicate the amount of assets it intends to purchase\nin the current program and bring it to an end.\n• President Plosser expects growth of about 3 percent in 2014.

Inflation expectations will be relatively stable, and inflation will move up\ntoward the FOMC target of 2 percent over the next year.\n\nIntroduction\nI thank Bill Githens and his staff for inviting me here today. It is my honor to welcome\nyou to Philadelphia as the Risk Management Association (RMA) begins its\ncommemoration of a century of promoting sound risk principles in the financial services\nindustry.\nNext month, the Federal Reserve System also begins its centennial year, marking 100\nyears from when President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act on\nDecember 23, 1913. Our centennial period will continue until next November, the\n100th anniversary of when the 12 Federal Reserve Banks first opened their doors on\nNovember 16, 1914.\n\n1\n\n\fTherefore, the RMA and the Federal Reserve System each have a long and rich history. I\nalso noted that Philadelphia and Rochester, New York, figure prominently in your\norganization’s history and my own biography. The first meeting of what was then\nknown as the “Robert Morris Club of the National Association of Credit Men” was held\nin Rochester in June 1914. I arrived in Rochester more than 60 years too late to attend,\nbut I enjoyed more than 30 years at the University of Rochester before joining the\nPhiladelphia Fed in 2006.\nDuring these past seven years, I have found that many people still find our nation’s\ncentral bank a mystery. People often hear about the Fed in the news, yet not everyone\nknows what we do or how we are structured. So, I will begin with a little background on\nthe Fed before I share some thoughts on the economic outlook and monetary policy.\nBefore I begin, though, I should note that my views are not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nA Historical Look at a Decentralized Fed\nSo first, let me share a little history with you. I have often described the Federal Reserve\nSystem as a uniquely American form of central banking – a decentralized central bank.\nTo understand how the Fed came to be, we need to look at two earlier attempts at\ncentral banking in the United States. Just a few blocks from here stand the vestiges of\nboth institutions, dating back to the early years of our nation when Philadelphia was the\nnation’s major financial and political center.\nAlexander Hamilton, who was an aide to Robert Morris during the American\nRevolutionary War and later became our nation’s first secretary of the Treasury,\nchampioned the First Bank of the United States to help our young nation manage its\nfinancial affairs. The First Bank received a 20-year charter from Congress and operated\nfrom 1791 to 1811. Although this charter was not renewed, the War of 1812 and the\nensuing inflation and economic turmoil convinced Congress to establish the Second\n2\n\n\fBank of the United States, which operated from 1816 to 1836. However, as with the\nFirst Bank, Congress did not renew the Second Bank’s charter. Both institutions failed to\novercome the public’s mistrust of centralized power and special interests.\nNearly 80 years later, Congress tried again to establish a central bank. The outcome was\na new central bank with a unique governance structure designed to decentralize\nauthority and promote public confidence. This unique structure helped overcome\npolitical and public opposition that stemmed from fears that this new central bank\nwould be dominated either by political interests in Washington or by financial interests\nin New York.\nTo balance political, economic, and geographic interests, Congress created the Federal\nReserve System with independently chartered regional Reserve Banks throughout the\ncountry, with oversight provided by a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. The act\ncreated a Reserve Bank Organization Committee to divide the country into no fewer\nthan eight and no more than 12 Federal Reserve Districts.\nThe committee held meetings in 18 cities around the country before submitting a report\nto Congress in April 1914, naming the 12 cities as sites for Federal Reserve Banks we\nhave today. These Reserve Banks distribute currency, act as a banker’s bank, and\ngenerally perform the functions of a central bank, which includes serving as the bank for\nthe U.S. Treasury. Another important priority for central banks, especially those in a\nworld of fiat currency, is to ensure the purchasing power of a nation’s currency through\nits monetary policy.\nWithin the Federal Reserve, the body that makes monetary policy decisions is the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or the FOMC. Here again, Congress has designed a\nnumber of checks and balances into the system. In 1935, Congress gave voting rights on\nthe FOMC to the seven Governors in Washington and five Reserve Bank presidents.\nUnder the current arrangement, the New York Fed president serves as a permanent\n\n3\n\n\fvoting member, and four of the other 11 presidents serve one-year terms on a rotating\nbasis.\nThis structure ensures that our national monetary policy is rooted not just in\nWashington or on Wall Street but also on Main streets across our diverse nation.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee’s assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. The FOMC meets eight times a year to set monetary\npolicy. It discusses economic conditions and, in normal times, adjusts short-term\ninterest rates to achieve the goals of monetary policy that Congress has set for us in the\nFederal Reserve Act.\nCongress established the current set of monetary policy goals in 1978. The amended\nFederal Reserve Act specifies that the FOMC “shall maintain long run growth of the\nmonetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential\nto increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment,\nstable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since moderate long-term\ninterest rates generally result when prices are stable and the economy is operating at\nfull employment, many have interpreted these instructions as being a dual mandate to\nmanage fluctuations in employment in the short run while preserving long run price\nstability.\nEconomic Conditions\nWith this mandate in mind, the Fed monitors the economy and makes its policy\ndecisions. The current economic expansion began in July 2009 – more than four years\nago. While economic growth has come in fits and starts, the underlying path is one of\ncontinued moderate expansion. The recent readings on third-quarter growth and the\nlabor market are consistent with an economy that is experiencing a moderate, selfsustaining recovery.\n\n4\n\n\fWe saw an advance estimate of 2.8 percent GDP growth in the third quarter, a bit\nhigher than the 2.5 percent growth in the second quarter. That upward trend continued\nfrom the 1.1 percent growth in the first quarter of this year and the nearly flat 0.1\npercent in the fourth quarter of last year.\nThis acceleration in growth rates reflects steady progress in the private-sector economy\nand a waning drag from the government sector.\nDespite the increase in payroll taxes at the start of the year, consumer spending\ncontinues to increase at a moderate pace. Even more encouraging is the robust,\ndouble-digit growth we’ve seen in residential investment. Sales of existing homes are\non the upswing, surpassing the 5 million mark, or about the same levels experienced\nbefore the housing boom. Home prices remain below their pre-crisis peaks, but prices\nhave made strong double-digit gains over the past year, according to the national\nindexes.\nManufacturing has also shown improvement. The national ISM Manufacturing index\nhas indicated industry expansion for the past five months. Here in the Third District, the\nPhiladelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers shows a similar pattern,\nwith increased activity for five consecutive months as well as strong optimism regarding\nactivity over the next six months.\nNevertheless, as I travel through the District and the country and talk to business\nleaders about their plans for capital spending and hiring, I hear a common theme of\nuncertainty about the course of fiscal policy and regulation. Most mention the\ndysfunction in Washington and the uncertainties over tax and spending policies, and\nespecially health care. Without a doubt, such factors are restraining investment and\nhiring, and generally contributing to the sluggishness of the recovery.\nAs some of this uncertainty abates — I don’t expect it to vanish — I anticipate overall\neconomic growth to accelerate somewhat to around 3 percent next year, a pace that is\nslightly above trend. This is far from the robust growth that many would like to see;\n5\n\n\fnevertheless, it does represent steady progress and a gradually improving economy. My\nforecast is in line with those of my colleagues on the FOMC, whose most recent\nprojections had a central tendency of growth of 2.0 to 2.3 percent for 2013, and\naccelerating to 2.9 to 3.1 percent in 2014.\nThe October jobs report came in stronger than many analysts expected. The economy\nadded 204,000 jobs in October. In addition, upward revisions to the August and\nSeptember figures added another 60,000 jobs.\nThe unemployment rate ticked up a tenth of a point to 7.3 percent, but federal\nemployees on temporary furloughs affected the household survey. The underlying\ndetail showed an increase of 448,000 workers on temporary layoff in October. The data\ndo not let us precisely measure how much of the increase is directly related to the\nshutdown, but that sharp increase was enough to push the unemployment rate higher\nthan it otherwise would have been, possibly by as much as a third of a percentage point.\nOf course, we will have a better idea of how the labor market has progressed when we\nhave the November report, which should not be distorted by the temporary shutdown.\nSubstantial improvement in labor market conditions was one condition that the FOMC\nset last September for ending our current asset purchase program, popularly called QE3\nfor the third round of quantitative easing. I believe the labor market has made\nimportant progress. Monthly job gains have averaged 191,000 since last September, far\nbetter than the 130,000 average in the six months leading up to the announcement of\nthe program. And the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.8 percentage points since last\nAugust.\nI anticipate that the unemployment rate will continue to decline over the next year at\nabout the same pace we’ve seen over the past two years. This should lead to an\nunemployment rate of about 6.25 percent by the end of 2014. This makes me\nsomewhat more optimistic than my FOMC colleagues, many of whom don’t see the\nunemployment rate reaching 6.5 percent until sometime in the first half of 2015.\n6\n\n\fTurning to inflation, the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation, the change in the price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, has averaged about 1.8 percent\nover the past three years and 2 percent over the past 20 years. Over the past year, it\nhas averaged 1.1 percent. This is below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent, and\nsome have voiced concerns about the risks of further disinflation. If this trend\ncontinues, it would be troubling. We must defend our 2-percent inflation target from\nbelow and above. One encouraging factor is that inflation expectations remain near\ntheir longer-term averages and consistent with our 2-percent target. But we must be\nvigilant that expectations remain anchored.\nSome of the lower readings on inflation appear to reflect some transitory factors, such\nas the cut in payments to Medicare providers imposed earlier this year as part of the\nsequester. More recent readings have been closer to goal, and I anticipate, as the\nFOMC indicated in its most recent statement, that inflation will move back toward our\ntarget over the medium term. But I do see some upside risk to inflation in the\nintermediate to longer term, given the large amount of monetary accommodation we\nhave added and continue to add to the economy.\nMonetary Policy\nSo let me turn to some observations about monetary policy. Over the past five years,\nthe Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary actions to support the economic recovery.\nThe Fed has lowered its policy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially zero,\nwhere it has been for almost five years. Since the policy rate cannot go any lower, the\nFed has attempted to provide additional accommodation through large-scale asset\npurchases, or quantitative easing. As I mentioned earlier, we are now in our third round\nof these purchases, or QE3. These purchases have greatly expanded the size and\nlengthened the maturity of the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet.\nThe Fed is also using forward guidance that is intended to inform the public about the\nway monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. As for interest rates, the FOMC has\n7\n\n\freported that it expects to keep the fed funds rate at essentially zero at least until the\nunemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent, so long as the outlook for inflation one to two\nyears is projected to be no more than 2.5 percent and the public’s inflation expectations\nremain well anchored. The Committee also anticipates that the highly accommodative\nstance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the\neconomic recovery continues to gain strength.\nOn asset purchases, the FOMC has indicated that it will continue the purchases until the\noutlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the context of price stability.\nAs I noted, I believe that labor markets have substantially improved from a year ago and\nthat we should begin to wind down these asset purchases.\nThere was widespread public expectation that the FOMC would begin to slow the pace\nof its asset purchases in September. Yet, at that September meeting and again in\nOctober, the Committee decided not to change the pace of purchases. The Fed\ncontinues to purchase $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion\nof longer-term Treasury securities each month. Proceeds of maturing or prepaid\nsecurities are being reinvested. As a result, the Fed’s balance sheet is now just shy of $4\ntrillion in assets and growing at a pace of about $85 billion a month. The decision to\nmaintain the pace of purchases in September and await more evidence of sustained\neconomic progress came as quite a surprise to the public, generating widespread public\ndebate about the FOMC’s communications surrounding its policy intentions.\nNot dissuading the public from its expectation of a tapering and then not taking action\nundermines the credibility of the FOMC and reduces the effectiveness of forward\nguidance as a policy tool. The failure to follow through also contributes to additional\nuncertainty regarding the future course of monetary policy. In some quarters, the\ndecision not to begin tapering was also interpreted as a sign that the FOMC had become\nmuch less confident that growth would be sustained. Thus, we undermined our own\ncredibility as well as the public’s confidence in the economy. These were not the\n\n8\n\n\fmessages that I wanted to send. So, I disagreed with the decision not to go forward\nwith a modest reduction in the pace of our asset purchases.\nIn my view, this whole episode also demonstrates how difficult it is to fine-tune our\nopen-ended asset purchases and our forward guidance about them. We cannot\ncontinue to play this bond-buying game by ear and risk the Fed’s credibility while\ncreating lingering uncertainty about the course of monetary policy.\nWe need to define simple, clear dimensions to “right-size” the program. This will reduce\npolicy uncertainty and move the economy forward. My preference would be for the\nFOMC to announce a fixed amount for QE3, just as we did for the two prior rounds of\nasset purchases. When we reach that amount, we should stop the asset purchases, and\nthen reassess the state of the economy to determine if further action would be\nbeneficial. At that point, monetary policy would still be highly accommodative.\nWe are still learning how asset purchases affect the economy, but many believe it is the\nultimate size and composition of the assets, rather than the flow of purchases, that\ninfluences interest rates and thus the economy. This was the premise of the early\nrounds of purchases.\nSetting the ultimate size of our asset purchase program will lead us away from trying to\nfine-tune our decision about purchases based on the latest numbers and creating\nuncertainty from meeting to meeting about the FOMC’s next step. We should be\ngearing our asset purchase policy to the underlying trends in the economic expansion\nrather than the most recent month-to-month variations, which reflect very noisy signals\nof the economy at best. Just recall the surprises in the revisions to the employment\ndata we experienced. By specifying a fixed amount, we would help the public\nunderstand that reducing the pace of asset purchases does not signal a change in our\npolicy rate. Indeed, even an end to purchases only stops the efforts to increase\naccommodation. It is not a tightening of policy. As I said, after our purchases stop,\npolicy will remain highly accommodative. An end to the purchase program does not\n9\n\n\fimply that increases in the policy rate are imminent. We will simply set our policy rate\nconsistent with promoting the FOMC’s goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the economy is continuing to improve at a moderate pace.\nWe are likely to see growth pick up to around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor\nmarkets will continue to improve gradually, and I expect unemployment rates near 7\npercent within the next few months and 6.25 percent by the end of 2014. I also believe\nthat inflation expectations will be relatively stable and that inflation will move up to our\ngoal of 2 percent over the next year.\nBased on this outlook and the improvement in labor market conditions, I believe it\nwould be appropriate for the Fed to communicate the amount of assets it intends to\npurchase in the current program and bring it to an end. We should then reassess the\neconomic trends and the outlook to determine if further efforts to increase\naccommodation are required. This approach would also yield a simpler program — one\nthat is easier for policymakers to manage, easier to explain to the public, and easier to\nexit when the time comes.\n\n10\n\n\f"

When Jim told me that this year’s conference was\ntitled “Was the Fed a Good Idea?” I must confess that I was little worried. I couldn’t help but\nnotice that I was the only sitting central banker on the program. But as the Fed approaches its\n100th anniversary, it is entirely appropriate to reflect on its history and its future. Today, I plan\nto discuss what I believe is the Federal Reserve’s essential role and consider how it might be\nimproved as an institution to better fulfill that role.\n1\n\n\fBefore I begin, I should note that my views are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nDouglass C. North was cowinner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on the role\nthat institutions play in economic growth. 1 North argued that institutions were deliberately\ndevised to constrain interactions among parties both public and private. In the spirit of North’s\nwork, one theme of my talk today will be that the institutional structure of the central bank\nmatters. The central bank’s goals and objectives, its framework for implementing policy, and its\ngovernance structure all affect its performance.\nCentral banks have been around for a long time, but they have clearly evolved as economies and\ngovernments have changed. Most countries today operate under a fiat money regime, in which\na nation’s currency has value because the government says it does. Central banks usually are\ngiven the responsibility to protect and preserve the value or purchasing power of the currency. 2\nIn the U.S., the Fed does so by buying or selling assets in order to manage the growth of money\nand credit. The ability to buy and sell assets gives the Fed considerable power to intervene in\nfinancial markets not only through the quantity of its transactions but also through the types of\nassets it can buy and sell. Thus, it is entirely appropriate that governments establish their\ncentral banks with limits that constrain the actions of the central bank to one degree or another.\nYet, in recent years, we have seen many of the explicit and implicit limits stretched. The Fed and\nmany other central banks have taken extraordinary steps to address a global financial crisis and\nthe ensuing recession. These steps have challenged the accepted boundaries of central banking\nand have been both applauded and denounced. For example, the Fed has adopted\nunconventional large-scale asset purchases to increase accommodation after it reduced its\n1\n\nFor more about Douglass C. North and his cowinner Robert W. Fogel and the 1993 Nobel Memorial Prize in\nEconomic Sciences, see Nobel Media, \"The Prize in Economics 1993 - Press Release,\" (1993),\nwww.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1993/press.html (Accessed November 11, 2013).\nSee also Douglass C. North, “Institutions,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, 5:1 (1991), pp. 97–112.\n\n2\n\nCountries can and do pursue different means of setting the value of their currency, including pegging their\nmonetary policy to that of another country, but I will not concern myself with such issues in these comments.\n\n2\n\n\fconventional policy tool, the federal funds rate, to near zero. These asset purchases have led to\nthe creation of trillions of dollars of reserves in the banking system and have greatly expanded\nthe Fed’s balance sheet. But the Fed has done more than just purchase lots of assets; it has\naltered the composition of its balance sheet through the types of assets it has purchased. I have\nspoken on a number of occasions about my concerns that these actions to purchase specific\n(non-Treasury) assets amounted to a form of credit allocation, which targets specific industries,\nsectors, or firms. These credit policies cross the boundary from monetary policy and venture\ninto the realm of fiscal policy. 3 I include in this category the purchases of mortgage-backed\nsecurities (MBS) as well as emergency lending under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, in\nsupport of the bailouts, most notably of Bear Stearns and AIG. Regardless of the rationale for\nthese actions, one needs to consider the long-term repercussions that such actions may have on\nthe central bank as an institution.\nAs we contemplate what the Fed of the future should look like, I will discuss whether constraints\non its goals might help limit the range of objectives it could use to justify its actions. I will also\nconsider restrictions on the types of assets it can purchase to limit its interference with market\nallocations of scarce capital and generally to avoid engaging in actions that are best left to the\nfiscal authorities or the markets. I will also touch on governance and accountability of our\ninstitution and ways to implement policies that limit discretion and improve outcomes and\naccountability.\nGoals and Objectives\nLet me begin by addressing the goals and objectives for the Federal Reserve. These have\nevolved over time. When the Fed was first established in 1913, the U.S. and the world were\noperating under a classical gold standard. Therefore, price stability was not among the stated\n\n3\n\nSee Charles Plosser, “Ensuring Sound Monetary Policy in the Aftermath of Crisis,” speech given to the U.S.\nMonetary Policy Forum, The Initiative on Global Markets, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York,\nNY, February 27, 2009, and Charles Plosser, “Fiscal Policy and Monetary Policy: Restoring the Boundaries,” a speech\nto the same group, February 24, 2012.\n\n3\n\n\fgoals in the original Federal Reserve Act. Indeed, the primary objective in the preamble was to\nprovide an “elastic currency.”\nThe gold standard had some desirable features. Domestic and international legal commitments\nregarding convertibility were important disciplining devices that were essential to the regime’s\nability to deliver general price stability. The gold standard was a de facto rule that most people\nunderstood, and it allowed markets to function more efficiently because the price level was\nmostly stable.\nBut, the international gold standard began to unravel and was abandoned during World War I. 4\nAfter the war, efforts to reestablish parity proved disruptive and costly in both economic and\npolitical terms. Attempts to reestablish a gold standard ultimately fell apart in the 1930s. As a\nresult, most of the world now operates under a fiat money regime, which has made price\nstability an important priority for those central banks charged with ensuring the purchasing\npower of the currency.\nCongress established the current set of monetary policy goals in 1978. The amended Federal\nReserve Act specifies the Fed “shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit\naggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as\nto promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate longterm interest rates.” Since moderate long-term interest rates generally result when prices are\nstable and the economy is operating at full employment, many have interpreted these goals as a\ndual mandate with price stability and maximum employment as the focus.\nLet me point out that the instructions from Congress call for the FOMC to stress the “long run\ngrowth” of money and credit commensurate with the economy’s “long run potential.” There are\nmany other things that Congress could have specified, but it chose not to do so. The act doesn’t\n4\n\nSee Ben S. Bernanke, \"A Century of U.S. Central Banking: Goals, Frameworks, Accountability,” speech to the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA, July 10, 2013; and Jeffrey M. Lacker, “Global\nInterdependence and Central Banking,” speech to the Global Interdependence Center, Philadelphia, November 1,\n2013.\n\n4\n\n\ftalk about managing short-term credit allocation across sectors; it doesn’t mention inflating\nhousing prices or other asset prices. It also doesn’t mention reducing short-term fluctuations in\nemployment.\nMany discussions about the Fed’s mandate seem to forget the emphasis on the long run. The\npublic, and perhaps even some within the Fed, have come to accept as an axiom that monetary\npolicy can and should attempt to manage fluctuations in employment. Rather than simply set a\nmonetary environment “commensurate” with the “long run potential to increase production,”\nthese individuals seek policies that attempt to manage fluctuations in employment over the\nshort run.\nThe active pursuit of employment objectives has been and continues to be problematic for the\nFed. Most economists are dubious of the ability of monetary policy to predictably and precisely\ncontrol employment in the short run, and there is a strong consensus that, in the long run,\nmonetary policy cannot determine employment. As the FOMC noted in its statement on longerrun goals adopted in 2012, “the maximum level of employment is largely determined by\nnonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.” In my view,\nfocusing on short-run control of employment weakens the credibility and effectiveness of the\nFed in achieving its price stability objective. We learned this lesson most dramatically during the\n1970s when, despite the extensive efforts to reduce unemployment, the Fed essentially failed,\nand the nation experienced a prolonged period of high unemployment and high inflation. The\neconomy paid the price in the form of a deep recession, as the Fed sought to restore the\ncredibility of its commitment to price stability.\nWhen establishing the longer-term goals and objectives for any organization, and particularly\none that serves the public, it is important that the goals be achievable. Assigning unachievable\ngoals to organizations is a recipe for failure. For the Fed, it could mean a loss of public\nconfidence. I fear that the public has come to expect too much from its central bank and too\nmuch from monetary policy, in particular. We need to heed the words of another Nobel Prize\nwinner, Milton Friedman. In his 1967 presidential address to the American Economic\nAssociation, he said, “…we are in danger of assigning to monetary policy a larger role than it can\n5\n\n\fperform, in danger of asking it to accomplish tasks that it cannot achieve, and as a result, in\ndanger of preventing it from making the contribution that it is capable of making.” 5 In the 1970s\nwe saw the truth in Friedman’s earlier admonitions. I think that over the past 40 years, with the\nexception of the Paul Volcker era, we failed to heed this warning. We have assigned an everexpanding role for monetary policy, and we expect our central bank to solve all manner of\neconomic woes for which it is ill-suited to address. We need to better align the expectations of\nmonetary policy with what it is actually capable of achieving.\nThe so-called dual mandate has contributed to this expansionary view of the powers of\nmonetary policy. Even though the 2012 statement of objectives acknowledged that it is\ninappropriate to set a fixed goal for employment and that maximum employment is influenced\nby many factors, the FOMC’s recent policy statements have increasingly given the impression\nthat it wants to achieve an employment goal as quickly as possible. 6\nI believe that the aggressive pursuit of broad and expansive objectives is quite risky and could\nhave very undesirable repercussions down the road, including undermining the public’s\nconfidence in the institution, its legitimacy, and its independence. To put this in different terms,\nassigning multiple objectives for the central bank opens the door to highly discretionary policies,\nwhich can be justified by shifting the focus or rationale for action from goal to goal.\nI have concluded that it would be appropriate to redefine the Fed’s monetary policy goals to\nfocus solely, or at least primarily, on price stability. I base this on two facts: Monetary policy has\nvery limited ability to influence real variables, such as employment. And, in a regime with fiat\ncurrency, only the central bank can ensure price stability. Indeed, it is the one goal that the\ncentral bank can achieve over the longer run.\nGovernance and Central Bank Independence\n5\n\nSee Milton Friedman, “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, 58:1 (March 1968), pp. 1–17.\n\n6\n\nSee Daniel L. Thornton, “The Dual Mandate: Has the Fed Changed Its Objective?” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nReview, 94 (March/April 2012), pp. 117–33.\n\n6\n\n\fEven with a narrow mandate to focus on price stability, the institution must be well designed if it\nis to be successful. To meet even this narrow mandate, the central bank must have a fair\namount of independence from the political process so that it can set policy for the long run\nwithout the pressure to print money as a substitute for tough fiscal choices. Good governance\nrequires a healthy degree of separation between those responsible for taxes and expenditures\nand those responsible for printing money.\nThe original design of the Fed’s governance recognized the importance of this independence.\nConsider its decentralized, public-private structure, with Governors appointed by the U.S.\nPresident and confirmed by the Senate, and Fed presidents chosen by their boards of directors.\nThis design helps ensure a diversity of views and a more decentralized governance structure that\nreduces the potential for abuses and capture by special interests or political agendas. It also\nreinforces the independence of monetary policymaking, which leads to better economic\noutcomes.\nImplementing Policy and Limiting Discretion\nSuch independence in a democracy also necessitates that the central bank remain accountable.\nIts activities also need to be constrained in a manner that limits its discretionary authority. As I\nhave already argued, a narrow mandate is an important limiting factor on an expansionist view\nof the role and scope for monetary policy.\nWhat other sorts of constraints are appropriate on the activities of central banks? I believe that\nmonetary policy and fiscal policy should have clear boundaries. 7 Independence is what Congress\ncan and should grant the Fed, but, in exchange for such independence, the central bank should\nbe constrained from conducting fiscal policy. As I have already mentioned, the Fed has ventured\ninto the realm of fiscal policy by its purchase programs of assets that target specific industries\nand individual firms. One way to circumscribe the range of activities a central bank can\nundertake is to limit the assets it can buy and hold.\n7\n\nSee Plosser (2009) and Plosser (2012).\n\n7\n\n\fIn its System Open Market Account, the Fed is allowed to hold only U.S. government securities\nand securities that are direct obligations of or fully guaranteed by agencies of the United States.\nBut these restrictions still allowed the Fed to purchase large amounts of agency mortgagebacked securities in its effort to boost the housing sector. My preference would be to limit Fed\npurchases to Treasury securities and return the Fed’s balance sheet to an all-Treasury portfolio.\nThis would limit the ability of the Fed to engage in credit policies that target specific industries.\nAs I’ve already noted, such programs to allocate credit rightfully belong in the realm of the fiscal\nauthorities – not the central bank.\nA third way to constrain central bank actions is to direct the monetary authority to conduct\npolicy in a systematic, rule-like manner. 8 It is often difficult for policymakers to choose a\nsystematic rule-like approach that would tie their hands and thus limit their discretionary\nauthority. Yet, research has discussed the benefits of rule-like behavior for some time. Rules\nare transparent and therefore allow for simpler and more effective communication of policy\ndecisions. Moreover, a large body of research emphasizes the important role expectations play\nin determining economic outcomes. When policy is set systematically, the public and financial\nmarket participants can form better expectations about policy. Policy is no longer a source of\ninstability or uncertainty. While choosing an appropriate rule is important, research shows that\nin a wide variety of models simple, robust monetary policy rules can produce outcomes close to\nthose delivered by each model’s optimal policy rule.\nSystematic policy can also help preserve a central bank’s independence. When the public has a\nbetter understanding of policymakers’ intentions, it is able to hold the central bank more\naccountable for its actions. And the rule-like behavior helps to keep policy focused on the\ncentral bank’s objectives, limiting discretionary actions that may wander toward other agendas\nand goals.\n8\n\nSee Charles Plosser, “The Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy,” speech given to the National Association for\nBusiness Economics, Washington Economic Policy Conference, Washington, D.C., March 3, 2008. Also see Finn E.\nKydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,” Journal of\nPolitical Economy, 85 (January 1977), pp. 473–91.\n\n8\n\n\fCongress is not the appropriate body to determine the form of such a rule. However, Congress\ncould direct the monetary authority to communicate the broad guidelines the authority will use\nto conduct policy. One way this might work is to require the Fed to publicly describe how it will\nsystematically conduct policy in normal times – this might be incorporated into the semiannual\nMonetary Policy Report submitted to Congress. This would hold the Fed accountable. If the\nFOMC chooses to deviate from the guidelines, it must then explain why and how it intends to\nreturn to its prescribed guidelines.\nMy sense is that the recent difficulty the Fed has faced in trying to offer clear and transparent\nguidance on its current and future policy path stems from the fact that policymakers still desire\nto maintain discretion in setting monetary policy. Effective forward guidance, however, requires\ncommitment to behave in a particular way in the future. But discretion is the antithesis of\ncommitment and undermines the effectiveness of forward guidance. Given this tension, few\nshould be surprised that the Fed has struggled with its communications.\nWhat is the answer? I see three: Simplify the goals. Constrain the tools. Make decisions more\nsystematically. All three steps can lead to clearer communications and a better understanding\non the part of the public. Creating a stronger policymaking framework will ultimately produce\nbetter economic outcomes.\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\nBefore concluding, I would like to say a few words about the role that the central bank plays in\npromoting financial stability. Since the financial crisis, there has been an expansion of the Fed’s\nresponsibilities for controlling macroprudential and systemic risk. Some have even called for an\nexpansion of the monetary policy mandate to include an explicit goal for financial stability. I\nthink this would be a mistake.\nThe Fed plays an important role as the lender of last resort, offering liquidity to solvent firms in\ntimes of extreme financial stress to forestall contagion and mitigate systemic risk. This liquidity\nis intended to help ensure that solvent institutions facing temporary liquidity problems remain\n\n9\n\n\fsolvent and that there is sufficient liquidity in the banking system to meet the demand for\ncurrency. In this sense, liquidity lending is simply providing an “elastic currency.”\nThus, the role of lender of last resort is not to prop up insolvent institutions. However, in some\ncases during the crisis, the Fed played a role in the resolution of particular insolvent firms that\nwere deemed systemically important financial firms. Subsequently, the Dodd-Frank Act has\nlimited some of the lending actions the Fed can take with individual firms under Section 13(3).\nNonetheless, by taking these actions, the Fed has created expectations – perhaps unrealistic\nones – about what the Fed can and should do to combat financial instability.\nJust as it is true for monetary policy, it is important to be clear about the Fed’s responsibilities\nfor promoting financial stability. It is unrealistic to expect the central bank to alleviate all\nsystemic risk in financial markets. Expanding the Fed's regulatory responsibilities too broadly\nincreases the chances that there will be short-run conflicts between its monetary policy goals\nand its supervisory and regulatory goals. This should be avoided, as it could undermine the\ncredibility of the Fed’s commitment to price stability.\nSimilarly, the central bank should set boundaries and guidelines for its lending policy that it can\ncredibly commit to follow. If the set of institutions having regular access to the Fed’s credit\nfacilities is expanded too far, it will create moral hazard and distort the market mechanism for\nallocating credit. This can end up undermining the very financial stability that it is supposed to\npromote.\nEmergencies can and do arise. If the Fed is asked by the fiscal authorities to intervene by\nallocating credit to particular firms or sectors of the economy, then the Treasury should take\nthese assets off of the Fed’s balance sheet in exchange for Treasury securities. In 2009, I\nadvocated that we establish a new accord between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve that\nprotects the Fed in just such a way. 9 Such an arrangement would be similar to the Treasury-Fed\nAccord of 1951 that freed the Fed from keeping the interest rate on long-term Treasury debt\n9\n\nSee Plosser (2009).\n\n10\n\n\fbelow 2.5 percent. It would help ensure that when credit policies put taxpayer funds at risk,\nthey are the responsibility of the fiscal authority – not the Fed. A new accord would also return\ncontrol of the Fed’s balance sheet to the Fed so that it can conduct independent monetary\npolicy.\nMany observers think financial instability is endemic to the financial industry, and therefore, it\nmust be controlled through regulation and oversight. However, financial instability can also be a\nconsequence of governments and their policies, even those intended to reduce instability. I can\nthink of three ways in which central bank policies can increase the risks of financial instability.\nFirst, by rescuing firms or creating the expectation that creditors will be rescued, policymakers\neither implicitly or explicitly create moral hazard and excessive risking-taking by financial firms.\nFor this moral hazard to exist, it doesn’t matter if the taxpayer or the private sector provides the\nfunds. What matters is that creditors are protected, in part, if not entirely.\nSecond, by running credit policies, such as buying huge volumes of mortgage-backed securities\nthat distort market signals or the allocation of capital, policymakers can sow the seeds of\nfinancial instability because of the distortions that they create, which in time must be corrected.\nAnd third, by taking a highly discretionary approach to monetary policy, policymakers increase\nthe risks of financial instability by making monetary policy uncertain. Such uncertainty can lead\nmarkets to make unwise investment decisions – witness the complaints of those who took\npositions expecting the Fed to follow through with the taper decision in September of this year.\nThe Fed and other policymakers need to think more about the way their policies might\ncontribute to financial instability. I believe that it is important that the Fed take steps to conduct\nits own policies and to help other regulators reduce the contributions of such policies to\nfinancial instability. The more limited role for the central bank I have described here can\ncontribute to such efforts.\n\n11\n\n\fConclusion\nThe financial crisis and its aftermath have been challenging times for global economies and their\ninstitutions. The extraordinary actions taken by the Fed to combat the crisis and the ensuing\nrecession and to support recovery have expanded the roles assigned to monetary policy. The\npublic has come to expect too much from its central bank. To remedy this situation, I believe it\nwould be appropriate to set four limits on the central bank:\n•\n\nFirst, limit the Fed’s monetary policy goals to a narrow mandate in which price stability is\nthe sole, or at least the primary, objective;\n\n•\n\nSecond, limit the types of assets that the Fed can hold on its balance sheet to Treasury\nsecurities;\n\n•\n\nThird, limit the Fed’s discretion in monetary policymaking by requiring a systematic, rulelike approach;\n\n•\n\nAnd fourth, limit the boundaries of its lender-of-last-resort credit extension and ensure\nthat it is conducted in a systematic fashion.\n\nThese steps would yield a more limited central bank. In doing so, they would help preserve the\ncentral bank’s independence, thereby improving the effectiveness of monetary policy, and, at\nthe same time, they would make it easier for the public to hold the Fed accountable for its policy\ndecisions. These changes to the institution would strengthen the Fed for its next 100 years.\n\n12\n\n\f"

Because the FOMC failed to adjust the pace of\nasset purchases at that meeting, he believes the FOMC undermines the credibility of its own\nforward guidance.\n• President Plosser expects growth of around 3 percent in 2014. He expects unemployment\nrates near 7 percent by the end of this year or early next year and close to 6.25 percent by\nthe end of 2014. Inflation expectations will be relatively stable, and inflation will move up\ntoward the FOMC target of 2 percent over the next year.\n• President Plosser notes that while some of the decline in labor force participation has been\na result of transitory factors, the labor markets are also adjusting to longer-term structural\nadjustments driven by demographics and technological advancements. Monetary policy\nwould be ineffective in counteracting such structural trends – and it should not be used to\ntry to do so.\n\nIntroduction\nI want to thank the Greater Johnstown Cambria County Chamber of Commerce and\nJohnstown Area Regional Industries (JARI) for hosting today’s luncheon. I especially\nwant to thank Glenn Wilson, president and CEO of AmeriServ Financial, Inc., and Bill\nPolacek, president and CEO of JWF Industries, who both serve on advisory councils for\n\n1\n\n\fthe Philadelphia Fed. Their valuable contributions to the councils help to ensure that\nyour local business conditions factor into the formulation of monetary policy.\nLater this year, the Federal Reserve System will begin its centennial year, marking 100\nyears from the signing of the Federal Reserve Act on December 23, 1913, by President\nWoodrow Wilson. The centennial period will run through the 100th anniversary of\nwhen the 12 Federal Reserve Banks opened their doors on November 16, 1914.\nWhile many Americans hear about the Fed in the news every day – perhaps a bit too\nmuch these days – not everyone knows how we work or how we are structured. So, I\nwill begin with a little background on the Fed before I talk about my thoughts on the\neconomic outlook and monetary policy.\nI have often described the Federal Reserve System as a uniquely American form of\ncentral banking – a decentralized central bank. To understand how it came to be, it is\nuseful to review a little history. Just a few blocks from the Philadelphia Fed stand the\nvestiges of our country’s two earlier attempts at a central bank, dating back to the early\nyears of our nation when Philadelphia was the major financial and political center of the\ncountry.\nAlexander Hamilton, our nation’s first secretary of the Treasury, championed the first\nBank of the United States, which received a 20-year charter from Congress and operated\nfrom 1791 to 1811. Although the First Bank’s charter was not renewed, the War of 1812\nand the ensuing inflation and economic turmoil convinced Congress to establish the\nsecond Bank of the United States, which operated from 1816 to 1836. However, like its\npredecessor, the Second Bank did not have its charter renewed by Congress. Both\ninstitutions failed to overcome the public’s mistrust of centralized power and special\ninterests.\nIt took nearly 80 years before Congress tried again to establish a central bank. The\noutcome was a new central bank with a unique governance structure designed to\ndecentralize authority and promote public confidence. With the passage of the Federal\n2\n\n\fReserve Act of 1913, Congress provided for the establishment of independently\nchartered regional Reserve Banks throughout the country, overseen by a Board of\nGovernors in Washington, D.C.\nThe act created a Reserve Bank Organization Committee to divide the country into no\nfewer than eight and no more than 12 Federal Reserve Districts. As you can imagine,\nalmost immediately after the law was enacted, the committee started receiving\nnumerous letters and telegrams from local business owners, bankers, farmers, and\nothers, making the case for why a Reserve Bank should be located in their area. The\ncommittee held meetings in 18 cities around the country before submitting a report to\nCongress in April 1914, naming 12 cities as sites for Federal Reserve Banks. The Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia serves the Third District, which includes Delaware, the\nsouthern half of New Jersey, and the eastern two-thirds of Pennsylvania.\nThe Reserve Banks distribute currency, act as a banker’s bank, and generally perform\nthe functions of a central bank, including serving as the bank for the U.S. Treasury. A\ncentral bank also guides the country’s monetary policy. Within the Federal Reserve, the\nbody that makes monetary policy decisions is the Federal Open Market Committee, or\nthe FOMC. In establishing the FOMC in 1935, Congress gave votes to the seven\nGovernors in Washington and five Reserve Bank presidents. The current arrangement\nhas the New York Fed president serving as a permanent member and four of the other\n11 presidents serving one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nThis structure ensures that our national monetary policy has its roots not just in\nWashington or on Wall Street but also on Main Streets across our diverse nation.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee's assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. The Committee meets eight times a year to set monetary\npolicy. It discusses economic conditions and, in normal times, adjusts short-term\ninterest rates to best achieve the goals of monetary policy that Congress has set for us\nin the Federal Reserve Act. Specifically, in 1977, Congress revised the act to instruct the\n3\n\n\fFed to conduct policy “so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment,\nstable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since moderate long-term\ninterest rates generally result when prices are stable, it is often said that Congress has\ngiven the Fed a “dual mandate.”\nThe structure of the Fed was deliberately designed to preserve a diversity of views and\nto provide checks and balances. Indeed, I believe the diversity of opinion around the\nFOMC table is one of its great strengths, but that diversity of views also requires me to\nnote that I speak for myself and not for the Federal Reserve Board or for my colleagues\non the Federal Open Market Committee.\nNow let me turn to the state of our economy as we enter the final quarter of 2013.\nEconomic Conditions\nThe economic expansion began in July 2009 – more than four years ago. It hasn’t been\na smooth path – frankly, it never is – and growth has been somewhat weaker than many\nanticipated. However, progress is being made, and there are signs of broad-based\nunderlying strength in the economy.\nThe economy expanded at an annualized rate of 2.5 percent in the second quarter of\nthis year, up from 1.1 percent in the first quarter and just 0.4 percent in the fourth\nquarter of 2012.\nFiscal drag, especially at the federal level, has weighed somewhat on economic growth\nover the past three quarters. In the fourth quarter of 2012, sharp declines in federal\ngovernment spending subtracted 1.3 points from overall GDP, and in the second\nquarter, it subtracted 0.2 points. Most of the decline has been in national defense\nspending.\nIn contrast, the private sector has performed much better. Approximately half of the\nsecond-quarter growth came from higher personal consumption, which was well\ndistributed across durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. The moderate pace\n4\n\n\fof spending was stronger than many expected. They had feared that the increased\npayroll taxes and other sources of fiscal constraint would significantly depress the\nconsumer, but those concerns proved overblown. Improvements in household balance\nsheets, reflecting lower leverage and higher net worth, as well as moderate growth of\ndisposable personal income, have supported spending this year.\nBusiness investment also contributed to growth in the second quarter, but investment\nhas been increasing at only a modest pace so far this year. While sentiment has\nimproved, the data on new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods do not\npoint to much of a pickup, at least in the near term. Better news comes from the\nmanufacturing sector, which has shown encouraging signs of late. The September\nnational ISM manufacturing survey and our own Business Outlook Survey of\nmanufacturers in the Third District each registered their fourth consecutive month of\nexpansion. Additionally, respondents to our recent survey were the most optimistic\nthey have been since the spring of 2011.\nNevertheless, as I travel the District and the country and talk to business leaders about\ntheir plans for capital spending and hiring, uncertainty about the course of fiscal policy is\na common theme in their discussions. Most mention the stalemate in Washington and\nthe uncertainties over tax and spending policies, and especially health care. There is no\nquestion that such factors are restraining investment and hiring and contributing in a\nsignificant way to the sluggish recovery.\nHousing, however, remains a bright spot. The housing sector has shown significant\nimprovement over the past two years. Housing inventories are down, sales are up, and\nprices are now rising in many localities. Construction spending has also expanded,\nthough activity has leveled off in recent months, which may reflect higher mortgage\nrates.\nI expect overall economic growth to accelerate to around 3 percent next year, a pace\nthat is slightly above trend. This is far from the robust growth that many would like to\n5\n\n\fsee, but uncertainties loom large. Nevertheless, it represents steady progress and an\nimproving economy. My forecast is in line with those of my colleagues on the FOMC,\nwhose most recent projections had a central tendency of growth of 2.0 to 2.3 percent\nfor 2013, accelerating to 2.9 to 3.1 percent in 2014.\nThe moderate pace of expansion has supported sustained growth in payroll\nemployment and declines in the unemployment rate. Monthly job gains averaged\n180,000 for the first eight months of this year, very similar to last year’s pace. The\nsustained expansion in payrolls means that the U.S. has regained more than threequarters (78 percent) of the 8.7 million jobs lost in the Great Recession. Pennsylvania\nhas seen a similar improvement, also regaining about 78 percent of the 258,000 jobs it\nlost.\nThe unemployment rate has improved, dropping from 8.1 percent in August 2012 to 7.3\npercent in August 2013, the most recent number available. The total number of people\nunemployed has declined by 1.2 million over the past 12 months and is down 4 million\nsince the peak in October 2009.\nI anticipate that over the next year the unemployment rate will continue to decline at\nabout the same pace we’ve seen over the past two years. This should lead to an\nunemployment rate of about 6.25 percent by the end of next year. This makes me\nsomewhat more optimistic than many of my FOMC colleagues, who don’t see the\nunemployment rate reaching 6.5 percent until sometime in the first half of 2015.\nMany analysts have dismissed the steady decline in the unemployment rate because it\nhas been driven to some degree by people dropping out of the labor force rather than\nfinding jobs. Such actions depress the labor force participation rate. But even the\nunemployment rate measures that include these discouraged workers and those\nworking part time for economic reasons have shown sustained declines as the recovery\nhas progressed.\n\n6\n\n\fIt is important to recognize that labor force participation is influenced not only by the\nstate of the business cycle but also by longer-term factors, like demographics. For\nexample, labor force participation for those aged 16 to 19 years has declined 7.2\npercentage points since the start of the recession in December 2007, a sharp drop, to be\nsure. But in the seven-year period before the recession, participation by that age group\nfell 11 percentage points. For those aged 20 to 24 years, participation has fallen 3.6\npercentage points since the start of the recession, the exact same trend as in the\npreceding seven-year period. In fact, every age group except those aged 55 and older\nsaw decreasing participation rates well before the recession. And the overall\nparticipation rate was falling too.\nThis longer-term decline in labor force participation is separate from the decline we\ntypically see during recessions. For example, independent of the business cycle, the\nentry of more women into the labor force was a major factor in the rising participation\nrate for several decades. Our earliest data are from 1948, and at that time, only one in\nthree women were in the labor force. That rate nearly doubled to a peak of 60 percent\nin the late 1990s. Since then, though, female participation has been drifting down. In\naddition, the male labor force participation rate has been declining steadily since we\nstarted collecting data in 1948. Some of the decline in both male and female\nparticipation is attributable to the aging baby boomers, who entered their prime\nworking years in the 1970s and 1980s. As that generation moves through older age\nbrackets, participation becomes lower, bringing down the overall rate. A broad research\nagenda is attempting to distinguish how much recent declines in participation can be\nexplained by these demographic trends and how much is cyclical or transitory, but the\nestimates vary greatly. 1 Still, there is widespread acknowledgment that the monthly job\n1\n\nResearchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago estimate that nearly half of the decline in\nparticipation over the past 13 years is attributable to these long-running demographic trends. See Daniel\nAaronson, Jonathan Davis, and Luojia Hu, “Explaining the Decline in the U.S. Labor Force Participation\nRate,” Chicago Fed Letter, No. 296, March 2012. Also, the Chicago Fed estimates that the monthly job\ngrowth required to bring down the unemployment rate is sharply lower than what was required in the\n1980s and 1990s, when labor force participation rates were increasing. See Daniel Aaronson and Scott\nBrave, “Estimating the Trend in Employment Growth,” Chicago Fed Letter, No. 312, July 2013.\n\n7\n\n\fgrowth required to bring down the unemployment rate is considerably lower than what\nwas required in the 1980s and 1990s when labor force participation rates were\nincreasing. Consequently, while some of the decline in labor force participation is\ncyclical, there is certainly a secular component too. Monetary policy would be\nineffective in counteracting such demographic and secular trends – and it should not be\nused to try to do so.\nWhat monetary policy is designed to do, at least over the long run, is control inflation.\nIn my view, price stability is the key part of our mandate. The Fed’s preferred gauge for\ninflation, the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE,\nhas averaged about 1.8 percent over the past three years and 2 percent over the past 20\nyears. Over the past year, it has averaged 1.2 percent. This is below the FOMC’s longrun goal of 2 percent, and some have voiced concerns about deflation. I do not perceive\nthat we will have a deflation problem. Some of the lower readings on inflation appear\nto reflect some transitory factors, such as the cut in payments to Medicare providers\nimposed earlier this year as part of the sequester. More recent readings have been\ncloser to goal, and I anticipate, as the FOMC indicated in its most recent statement, that\ninflation will move back toward our target over the medium term. I do see some upside\nrisk to inflation in the intermediate to longer term given the large amount of monetary\naccommodation we have added and continue to add to the economy.\nMonetary Policy\nSo let me turn to some observations about monetary policy. Over the past five years,\nthe Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary actions to support the economic recovery.\nThe Fed has lowered its policy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially zero,\nwhere it has been for almost five years. Since the policy rate cannot go lower, the Fed\nhas attempted to provide additional accommodation through large-scale asset\npurchases, or quantitative easing. These purchases have greatly expanded the size and\nlengthened the maturity of the assets on the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n8\n\n\fThe Fed is also using communications to inform the public about how monetary policy is\nlikely to evolve in the future. In Fed speak, this is called forward guidance. On interest\nrates, the FOMC has said that it expects to keep the fed funds rate at essentially zero at\nleast until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent, so long as inflation one to two\nyears ahead is projected to be no more than 2.5 percent and the public’s inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored. It also anticipates that the highly accommodative\nstance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the\neconomic recovery strengthens.\nOn asset purchases, the FOMC has indicated that it will continue the purchases until the\noutlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the context of price stability.\nIn addition, at his June press conference, Chairman Bernanke indicated that if incoming\neconomic data were broadly consistent with the FOMC’s economic projections, which\nanticipated continued gains in labor markets, moderate growth that picks up, and\ninflation that moves back toward the 2 percent target over time, then the FOMC would\nbegin to reduce the pace of its purchases sometime this year. And if the economy\nevolves as expected, we would continue to reduce the pace and end the purchases\naround the middle of next year.\nAfter the June press conference and over the course of the summer, there was an\nincreasingly widespread public belief that the FOMC would begin to reduce the pace of\nits asset purchases in September. Yet at that September meeting, the Committee\ndecided to make no change in monetary policy. The Fed continues to purchase $40\nbillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities each month. Proceeds of maturing or prepaid securities are being reinvested.\nAs a result, the Fed's balance sheet, which includes about $3.7 trillion in assets, is\ngrowing at a pace of about $85 billion a month. The decision to maintain the pace of\npurchases and await more evidence of sustained economic progress came as quite a\nsurprise to the public and there ensued widespread public debate about the FOMC’s\ncommunications surrounding its policy intentions.\n9\n\n\fIn my view, the incoming data between the June and September meetings were largely\nin line with our June forecasts. While it is true that the FOMC projections for 2013 were\nrevised down slightly, the differences between the central tendencies reported in June\nand September were statistically and economically insignificant.\nTo delay tapering of our current asset purchase scheme without clear and significant\ndepartures from prior guidelines suggested the FOMC was changing the goalposts and\ndeviating from June’s forward guidance. This undermines the credibility of the\nCommittee and reduces the effectiveness of forward guidance as a policy tool. It also\ncontributes to additional uncertainty regarding the future course of monetary policy.\nThe decision not to begin tapering our asset purchases was also read in some quarters\nas a sign that the FOMC had become much less confident that growth would be\nsustained in the manner the Committee envisioned in June. Thus, we undermined our\nown credibility as well as the public’s confidence in the economy. These were not the\nmessages that I wanted to send. Thus, I disagreed with the decision not to go forward\nwith a modest reduction in the pace of our asset purchases.\nThe Fed’s balance sheet is expanding rapidly due to these purchases and complicating\nthe eventual exit from this period of extraordinary monetary ease. There is little\nevidence that continued efforts to increase accommodation through asset purchases\nwill lead to any significant improvement in the labor markets or economic growth.\nThus, I believe the time has come for an expeditious phaseout of the purchase program.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the economy is continuing to improve at a moderate pace.\nWe are likely to see growth of around 2.5 percent this year, but that pace should pick up\nto around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor markets will continue to improve\ngradually, and I expect unemployment rates near 7 percent by the end of this year and\n6.25 percent by the end of 2014. I believe that inflation expectations will be relatively\nstable and that inflation will move up to our goal of 2 percent over the next year.\n10\n\n\fBased on this outlook and the improvement in labor market conditions, I believe it\nwould be appropriate for the Fed to begin to reduce the pace at which we are\nexpanding our balance sheet and to bring the purchase program to a close. We missed\nan excellent opportunity to begin this tapering process in September. In my mind, this\nillustrates just how difficult it is going to be to wean ourselves off the extraordinary\nprocess of increasing accommodation we have embarked upon and begin to normalize\nmonetary policy in a timely manner that ensures a healthy and stable economy in the\nfuture. Because the FOMC failed to adjust the pace of asset purchases in response to\nthe improvement in economic conditions, I believe the FOMC undermines the credibility\nof its own forward guidance.\n\n11\n\n\f"

It is great to be here in beautiful Jackson Hole and to have the opportunity to\ncontemplate the economy and monetary policy with you today. I often say that one of the\nstrengths of the Federal Reserve System’s design is that it helps ensure that the perspective of\nthose determining our country’s monetary policy extends beyond the Washington beltway. I\nthink you would agree that today’s setting is not only beautiful but is far outside the beltway in\nmore ways than one, I suspect.\nToday, I would like to describe the current stance and rationale of monetary policy. I think\ncurrent policy poses a number of challenges going forward. My view is that the time has come\nfor us to exit our current asset purchase program and commit to a way forward that seeks to\nnormalize monetary policy. As usual, my colleagues will be delighted to hear me assure you\nthat these views are my own and do not represent the views of the FOMC or Federal Reserve\nSystem. Yet allowing for a diversity of views is, I believe, one of the great strengths of our\nFederal Reserve System. We should never think of this diversity of thought as an unfortunate\nflaw or an inconvenience when conducting policy. The structure of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee and its ability to foster an open dialog among participants and transparency in the\neyes of the public help prevent groupthink and preserve the FOMC’s independence. These\ninvaluable attributes of a sound central bank should never be taken for granted.\nOur Monetary Policy Toolkit and the Current Stance of Policy\nSo let me begin by outlining the monetary policy tools we are using and the current stance of\npolicy. The first tool is the traditional instrument of monetary policy, the federal funds rate.\nDuring the crisis and recession, the FOMC aggressively brought the target for the federal funds\ndown and since December 2008 the rate has been near zero. Since the funds rate is\nconstrained from going below zero, the Committee added a second policy tool. It began\npurchasing longer-term securities, both Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, as a way to\nput downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.\n2\n\n\fAlthough it is related to the other two tools, one could consider “forward guidance,” which\ndescribes our potential policy actions as the economy evolves, as a third tool of monetary\npolicy. One rationale for using forward guidance is that it provides more clarity. By allowing\nthe public to make more informed economic decisions, forward guidance can make policy more\neffective. Another rationale for using forward guidance is that in a number of economic\nmodels, when policymakers are stuck at the zero lower bound, promising to keep monetary\npolicy more accommodative well into the future can affect the public’s expectations about the\nfuture path of policy and therefore affect the current economy.\nIn its June statement, the FOMC reaffirmed that monetary policy will stay accommodative for\nsome time to come. The forward guidance about the fed funds rate was unchanged from the\nguidance introduced last December. The FOMC stated that it intends to keep the target funds\nrate at its current 0 to ¼ percent range as long as the unemployment rate is greater than 6.5\npercent, the inflation outlook one to two years ahead is no more than 2.5 percent, and longterm inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nThe forward guidance offered for asset purchases was also unchanged. The Committee stated\nthe purchases will continue until there is substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor\nmarket, so long as inflation remains well behaved. This guidance signals that the labor market\nis a key determinant of the purchase program, but it does not specify how the Committee will\nassess such improvement.\nIn the June press conference, Chairman Bernanke added some clarification and more specifics\nregarding the forward guidance for the latest round of asset purchases, which are adding $85\nbillion a month to our balance sheet. He referred to the central tendency of the Summary of\nEconomic Projections, which is prepared from submissions by all FOMC participants. He\nindicated that if the incoming data are broadly aligned with this central tendency outlook, the\nCommittee anticipates it would moderate the pace of monthly purchases later this year,\nperhaps ending them around mid-2014. The Chairman indicated that at that point, the\nunemployment rate is likely to be near 7 percent. If this plan unfolds as described, this latest\n\n3\n\n\fround of large-scale asset purchases would exceed $1 trillion and the Fed’s balance sheet\nwould grow to more than $4 trillion.\nSo what are the economic conditions that would lead the Committee to slow the pace at which\nwe are expanding the balance sheet? The central tendency of the FOMC projections describes\nan economy accelerating in the second half of this year and into 2014. They anticipate growth\nof 2.3 to 2.6 percent for 2013 and accelerating to 3.0 to 3.5 percent in 2014. The central\ntendency projects that the unemployment rate will decline to 7.2 to 7.3 percent by the end of\n2013 and reach 6.5 to 6.8 percent by the end of 2014. This is a faster pace of decline than\nprevious FOMC projections anticipated. In essence, Committee participants have taken on\nboard the steady pace of decline in unemployment over the past three years. Note that these\nprojections suggest it could be as early as the end of 2014 when the unemployment rate\nreaches 6.5 percent. That is the threshold at which the Committee indicated it would consider\nraising the funds rate target. The Chairman noted that the asset purchase program is expected\nto end before the Committee begins raising the fed funds rate. So, ending the program by mid2014, when the unemployment rate is anticipated to be around 7 percent, would be consistent\nwith this.\nAs for inflation, which has been running below the Fed’s longer-run objective of 2 percent, the\ncentral tendency projection calls for inflation as measured by the personal consumption\nexpenditure (PCE) price index to gradually rise from its current level to 1.4 to 2 percent by the\nend of 2014.\nThis central tendency forecast is one in which growth is gradually accelerating, unemployment\nis falling, and inflation is gradually returning to our target. The Chairman also noted that if the\neconomy improved more rapidly than anticipated, purchases could be wound down faster, and\nif it performed more poorly, the pace of reduction could be slowed or stopped.\nBy describing the path of purchases in terms of the evolution of economic conditions, the\nChairman was offering some insight into the Committee’s reaction function for its planned\nasset purchase program. I have long argued that the Committee should be more articulate\n4\n\n\fabout its policy reaction function, so I fully supported the Chairman’s comments providing this\nadded information. Nevertheless, I believe that a rules-based approach to policy would provide\ngreater clarity to the public about our policy intentions and be considerably more effective than\nour current efforts at clarity or forward guidance. Before I turn to that, let me make a few\npoints about interpretation of our policy communication and the reaction in the market.\nInterpretation of Recent FOMC Communication\nSome have associated a slowing of the pace of purchases with a tightening of policy. This is\nincorrect. The balance sheet will still grow if we reduce the pace of purchases, so the level of\naccommodation will still increase. This is similar to the way one would think of normal policy.\nSuppose the Fed had been cutting the funds rate by 50 basis points for two meetings and then\ndecided to cut rates by 25 basis points. This would still be an easing move; we wouldn’t say it\nwas tightening policy. If we continue to purchase assets, albeit at a reduced pace, we would be\ncontinuing to add additional accommodation despite a gradually improving economy. 1\nIt is also important to note that even the end of purchases is not the start of policy tightening.\nIt simply means the effort to push rates even lower will cease, but policy will remain very\naccommodative. The prospect for actually tightening policy is provided by the Committee’s\nforward guidance on the funds rate, which says that we will not contemplate raising the target\nrate until the unemployment rate reaches 6.5 percent. That message has not changed. But it is\nstate-dependent forward guidance. Market participants might very well change their forecast\nof when 6.5 percent unemployment may be reached, which would cause rates to move. For\nexample, as economic conditions strengthen, markets may begin to expect unemployment\nrates to fall more quickly and for the Fed to begin raising rates sooner. We would expect to see\nmarket interest rates rise in response. In fact, the steady increase in long rates that we’ve\nexperienced over the past two months began before recent Fed communications. The increase\n1\n\nI do not subscribe to the view that we need to apply ever-increasing accommodation until the economy returns\nto normal. For a discussion of the dangers of such accelerationist monetary policy, see Charles I. Plosser, “The\nOutlook and the Hazards of Accelerationist Policy,” speech to the University of Delaware Center for Economic\nEducation and Entrepreneurship, Newark, DE, February 14, 2012.\n\n5\n\n\fseems to have begun with the May 3rd employment report, which indicated an unexpectedly\nstrong rise in April payrolls and significant upward revisions to the March and February data.\nMy Economic Forecast and Policy Views\nMy own forecast is in fact a bit more optimistic than the central tendency projections,\nespecially as it pertains to the unemployment rate. Specifically, I see the unemployment rate\nfalling somewhat more quickly than the central tendency projection. My forecast has the\nunemployment rate approaching 7 percent by the end of this year and 6.5 percent before the\nend of 2014. I also see inflation returning to our 2 percent target sooner than some do, as I\nbelieve the current period of low inflation is transitory and expectations remain relatively\nstable. In my view, it is important that we end purchases before we reach the 6.5 percent\nthreshold for considering an increase in the funds rate target. If we don’t, I believe the 6.5\npercent threshold will lose meaning. Would anyone believe we would raise the fed funds rate\nat the same time that we are increasing the size of the balance sheet through asset purchases?\nThus, consistent with my forecast and with the Committee’s forward guidance, I favor starting\nto reduce the pace of purchases and ending the asset purchase program by year-end.\nPolicy Challenges Going Forward\nI believe the recent efforts to clarify the state-contingent nature of the asset purchase program\nare a step in the right direction, but the Fed still faces significant challenges going forward. The\nchallenges arise as much, if not more, from the policy choices that the Fed has made, rather\nthan from a failure to communicate or a misunderstanding by the market.\nLet me begin by recapping some of the issues that have concerned me for some time. There is\nample commentary about the risks of removing accommodation too soon. I believe there is too\nlittle discussion about the risks of keeping too much accommodation in place for too long.\nUnwinding from a very large and growing balance sheet of long-duration assets will be difficult,\npotentially disruptive, and pose significant risks.\n\n6\n\n\fFailing to execute a graceful exit and falling behind the curve could risk significant inflation or a\nrapid increase in interest rates that may be counterproductive. I have often said that financial\nmarkets are unlikely to be patient as we unwind from this extraordinary accommodation. The\nrecent volatility in interest rates may be a taste of things to come. It illustrates just how\ndifficult the task will be when we truly begin to unwind. Aside from these challenges, some\nhave argued that the prolonged period of near-zero interest rates and our direct intervention in\nthe financial markets through our purchases could be contributing to the misallocation of\ncapital and other distortions that could result in financial instability. Growing threats of this\nnature are extremely hard to identify before it is too late — so we need to be wary of the\nunintended consequences of our actions and stay vigilant. Just because financial markets like\nwhat we are doing at the moment does not necessarily mean that it is the best thing for the\nlong term.\nAs I have mentioned on many occasions, the risks associated with unwinding a very large\nbalance sheet and with the potential financial distortions caused by extremely low interest\nrates have led me to conclude that our current asset purchase program fails the cost-benefit\ntest. The benefits have been meager at best. A great deal of the impact seems to have\nmanifested itself in various forms of financial reengineering or capital structure arbitrage; it has\nyielded little in the way of real business investment that would translate into greater labor\ndemand. It is time to exit from the asset purchase program in a gradual and predictable\nmanner.\nJust as the unconventional asset purchases have presented challenges, so too has the\nCommittee’s use of forward guidance. Economic theory and experience tell us that\nexpectations about the future can have an important impact on economic decisions made\ntoday. The FOMC has been using forward guidance in an attempt to manage the public’s\nexpectations of the future course of monetary policy as one of its policy tools. As I noted\nearlier, the theory suggests that when interest rates are constrained by the zero lower bound,\noffering forward guidance to keep interest rates low for an extended period can substitute for\nlowering short-term rates. Indeed, if such forward guidance were truly effective, there would\n7\n\n\fbe no need for an asset purchase program. One way such forward guidance might work is by\ntemporarily raising inflation expectations, which would induce consumers to save less and\nspend more today. Another channel would be by raising expectations about future economic\nprospects, which again would make consumers confident to spend more today rather than to\nsave for a rainy day. But managing expectations in this manner is much easier said than done.\nIn particular, forward guidance about the future policy path can change expectations and\nthereby affect the current economy only if policymakers credibly commit to follow that path.\nEveryone must believe that the central bank will actually deliver on the promise embodied in\nthe forward guidance. 2 If the commitment to the forward guidance is not credible, it will not\nhave the desired effect.\nWhile the FOMC has offered some forward guidance on future policy, it has been unwilling to\nmake a clear commitment to its forward guidance. Instead, the FOMC has offered a variety of\nchanging targets or signals about future behavior. Although the aim was to clarify our policy\nintentions, I believe the repeated changes have likely caused more confusion than illumination.\nIn August 2011, the Committee began using dates to signal when the policy rate might increase,\nbut it changed those dates at subsequent meetings. The FOMC then opted to formulate its\nforward guidance in terms of thresholds for unemployment and inflation. This is preferable to\ncalendar dates because it is state contingent. Yet, the FOMC has specifically said that the\nthresholds are not triggers — they are not firm commitments and they may change. The\nCommittee has repeatedly opted for language that allows a great deal of discretion to behave\nas it chooses, depending on the circumstances. But effective forward guidance demands\ncommitment. When the Committee stresses the general flexibility of its policy decisions or\nmakes vague references to data dependency, it does little to clarify the FOMC’s intentions\nabout future policy, even though clarity is what the FOMC wants to provide to the markets\nthrough its forward guidance. Thus, there is a fundamental tension between wanting to\nprovide clarity as to the forward course of policy and wanting to maintain complete discretion.\n\n2\n\nFor further discussion of forward guidance, see Charles I. Plosser, “Forward Guidance,” speech at the Stanford\nInstitute for Economic Policy Research’s (SIEPR) Associates Meeting, Stanford, CA, February 12, 2013.\n\n8\n\n\fThe Committee has failed to address this tension, which undermines the effectiveness of its\npolicy.\nI would add that this tension is not new. The Committee has typically preferred discretion over\nsystematic policy. Yet, in normal times, the conduct of policy was more predictable and the\npublic had come to expect policy to play out in mostly understandable ways. Since the crisis,\nthe old “rulebook,” so to speak, has been thrown out, but we haven’t replaced it with anything\nexcept some vague promises that have changed over time. This naturally leads to a lack of\nclarity in the eyes of the public and undermines the effectiveness of the forward guidance the\nCommittee offers.\nA Strategy for Moving Forward\nIn my view, rather than try to maintain discretion, policymakers would achieve better economic\noutcomes and greater clarity by taking a systematic approach to policy. But how do we get\nthere from here? I think we could vastly improve policy going forward by doing three things,\nwhich would begin to normalize monetary policy.\n•\n\nThe first step is to wind down our asset purchases by the end of the year in a gradual\nand predictable manner. As I said, I see little if any benefit from these purchases, and\ngrowing costs.\n\n•\n\nThe second step is for the FOMC to commit to its forward guidance on the fed funds\nrate path, that is, to begin treating the 6.5 percent unemployment rate and the 2.5\npercent inflation rate in the guidance as triggers rather than thresholds.\n\n•\n\nThe third part of the strategy is to provide information on how our interest rate policy\nwill evolve after the trigger is reached. A commitment to a robust policy rule, perhaps\nconsistent with the way policy was conducted prior to the crisis, would provide needed\nclarity on how the Committee intends to vary its policy in response to changes in\neconomic conditions.\n\nThese steps form part of a systematic approach to policymaking. They embody clarity and\ncommitment. By helping the public and market participants form more accurate judgments\n9\n\n\fabout the future course of policy, systematic policymaking can improve the efficacy of\nmonetary policy. Moreover, such an approach would help mitigate some of the risks\ninherent in navigating an exit from this period of extraordinary accommodation. I believe\nthe benefits of the systematic approach that I have outlined here could be substantial, and I\nbelieve it is worth the effort to achieve the necessary consensus to implement such a\nstrategy.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fReducing Financial Fragility by Ending Too Big to Fail\nEighth Annual Finance Conference\nBoston College Carroll School of Management\nBoston, MA\nJune 6, 2013\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nWhen Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act three\nyears ago, one of the highest priorities was to ensure that never again would U.S. taxpayers\nneed to bail out any bank or financial institution deemed too big to fail. The first two sections\nof Dodd-Frank attempted to address the issue. Title I focused on expanded oversight and\nregulation of systemically important financial institutions – known as SIFIs – and Title II called\nfor establishing an orderly resolution authority to resolve a failing systemically important firm\nwithout threatening financial stability.\nThe idea that a failing financial firm must be rescued to prevent risks to overall financial stability\nis at the heart of the most controversial aspects of the recent financial crisis. Having the\ngovernment intervene to rescue a private firm is largely anathema to the idea of a free market\neconomy. Just as reaping the rewards of success is an essential element of a market economy,\nbearing the costs of failure is equally important and necessary. The noted economist Allan\nMeltzer has said, “Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin. It doesn’t work.” 1 A\nreal or perceived guarantee that taxpayers will backstop losses distorts effective decisionmaking, encourages excessive risk-taking, and leads to financial fragility. Indeed, we often fail\n\n1\n\nSee Allan Meltzer, “Asian Problems and the IMF,” Cato Journal, 17:3 (Winter 1998) pp. 267-74.\n\n1\n\n\fto recognize that government policies or safety nets distort incentives in the financial sector in\nways that can aggravate rather than diminish financial fragility.\nToday, I will discuss why I think current efforts to eliminate the problem of too big to fail may\nnot be sufficient. I will also propose how a simpler approach to capital requirements and a\nmore rule-like resolution process can offer more effective and less complex solutions to ending\ntoo big to fail and thus reduce financial fragility. The first line of defense is to expect that all\nfinancial firms will maintain sufficient levels of capital to absorb losses arising from negative\nshocks, thus significantly reducing the risk of failure. It is striking to think of the number of\nfinancial firms that failed or were rescued during the crisis that were thought to be “well\ncapitalized.” Obviously, they were not. The second requirement for ending too big to fail is to\nestablish a rule-based framework that permits a large financial institution to, in fact, fail\nwithout placing the financial system at risk. Large financial firms and their creditors should not\nbe shielded by government guarantees or by regulatory discretion. Making it clear that\ncreditors will face significant losses in bankruptcy and will not be rescued forces creditors to\nmore studiously assess counterparty risk. It also provides greater incentives for them to enforce\nmore discipline on the borrower’s risk-taking activities.\nBefore I turn to specific proposals, permit me to reiterate some principles that help guide my\nthinking about the right approach to regulatory reform. I should point out that these are my\nown views and are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\nThe Value of Simple, Robust Regulations\nIn the context of monetary policy, I have long advocated simple, robust rules and transparent\ncommunications. 2 Robust rules are important because they are intended to work well in a\nvariety of environments. This reflects our limited knowledge about the true determinants of\n2\n\nSee, for example, Charles I. Plosser, “Transparency and Monetary Policy,” University of California, Santa Barbara\nEconomic Forecast Project, May 3, 2012, and Charles I. Plosser, “Output Gaps and Robust Policy Rules,” 2010\nEuropean Banking & Financial Forum, Czech National Bank, March 23, 2010.\n\n2\n\n\feconomic outcomes. Economists have also come to understand that using policies that are\noptimal in one specific economic model can often deliver very poor outcomes if that model\nproves incorrect. So a policy rule that operates well under a wide range of models is a better\nand more robust approach.\nThe same approach applies to the design of regulatory frameworks as well. Because the\nfinancial world is very complex, there is merit in simple, transparent regulatory solutions\ndesigned to work reasonably well in a wide range of situations. We want rules that regulators\ncan enforce without having superhuman knowledge or foresight. However, we can predict with\nvirtual certainty that private actors will seek to evade regulatory restrictions and taxes. This is\noften called “regulatory arbitrage.” We also know that enforcement costs rise as firms’\nincentives to evade regulations increase.\nIn my view, simple mechanisms that are harder to evade – and even better, mechanisms that\nutilize market forces to discipline firm behavior – are superior to an elaborate list of rules that\nseeks to cover every possible outcome. Simple and transparent regulatory mechanisms make it\neasier for market participants to predict how regulators are likely to behave. This, in turn,\nmakes it easier for regulators to credibly commit to implementing the regulations in a\nconsistent manner.\nYet regulators continue to write thousands of pages of rules. In many cases, they are rules that\nproscribe activities for financial institutions. Unfortunately, such rules quickly become out of\ndate as financial markets and products evolve. For example, regulations were not well\nequipped to deal with the myriad of structured products that developed during the decade\nleading up to the crisis. Do we really believe that another thousand pages of regulations will\nprevent the next crisis? Rather than trying to create regulatory rules that govern activities and\nplace ever-increasing burdens on regulators to get it exactly right, we should be insisting on\nsimple frameworks that increase market incentives to monitor and discipline the behavior of\nfirms.\n\n3\n\n\fI would also note that as regulation becomes ever more complex, compliance and enforcement\ncosts rise significantly. Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England has argued that regulation of\nthe financial sector is exploding, with the cost of compliance and supervision following suit. He\nargues that we could be more effective and more efficient by simplifying our approach to\nregulatory reform. 3 I whole-heartedly endorse this general approach.\nBank Capital and Too Big to Fail\nThe most effective preventive measure to reduce the probability that a financial firm will fail in\nthe first place is adequate capital. In addition, higher levels of capital may permit regulatory or\nmarket intervention before a firm actually fails, thereby making bankruptcy or bailouts\nunnecessary. The recognition of the importance of capital is acknowledged in Title I of DoddFrank, which gives regulators the power to assign a capital surcharge for systemically important\nfinancial institutions. However, deciding on what level of capital to require is not trivial.\nCurrent Basel III proposals call for a SIFI surcharge of 1 to 2.5 percent, which I fear may simply\nbe too low.\nIn addition to equity capital, requiring SIFIs to hold subordinated debt instruments, such as\ncontingent capital, may be a simpler and less costly approach to increase capital requirements.\nThe fact that market participants have already been adopting the use of contingent convertible\nbonds (CoCos) in various forms suggests that it might be more efficient to draw on reverse\nconvertible debt instruments rather than to impose drastic increases in equity capital. The\nappeal of reverse convertible debt is that it automatically becomes equity when, for example,\nthe firm’s capital falls below some trigger. These instruments allow a firm’s equity capital to\nincrease automatically when the firm comes under sufficient stress. 4\n\n3\n\nAndrew Haldane and Vasileios Madouros, “The Dog and the Frisbee,” the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s\n36th Economic Policy Symposium, “The Changing Policy Landscape,” Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 31, 2012.\n\n4\n\nThe Squam Lake Group has proposed another interesting form of capital, deferred compensation for managers.\nThey suggest that perhaps 20 percent of managers’ compensation be deferred for five years and that this\ncompensation is forfeited if the firm enters distress (according to some well-defined notion of distress, perhaps\n\n4\n\n\fThere have been a number of proposals for the design of CoCos. 5 My preference is to use a\nmarket-based trigger — for example, a trigger linked to the market value of the bank’s equity —\nand to set the trigger high enough so that the bank’s true economic capital remains positive\nwhen conversion is triggered. A market-based trigger will react to the most current\ninformation, unlike triggers based on book values or regulatory decisions. Even more\nimportant, since the trigger does not depend on regulatory discretion, it is more transparent\nand less likely to lead to regulatory forbearance. 6 Setting the trigger high enough so that the\nbank’s net worth is still substantially positive reduces the likelihood of the need for bankruptcy\nor resolution.\nEconomists have identified a number of potential complications with the use of CoCos having\nmarket-based triggers. Some critics have voiced concerns about the possibility of destabilizing\nbear runs and short-selling stocks of troubled banks as these firms approach the triggers. While\nthese concerns should be taken seriously, I do not believe they are compelling showstoppers.\nFor example, using average stock prices over a length of time and putting some restrictions on\nshort-selling by holders of CoCos should reduce concerns about excessive noise in stock prices.\nThese approaches would also reduce the possibility of bear runs to force conversion. 7\nBecause these instruments would be treated as a form of debt until conversion, they could\nserve the same function as higher capital and, accordingly, satisfy capital requirements but may\nthe conversion of its reverse convertibles). Squam Lake Group, “Aligning Incentives at Systemically Important\nFinancial Institutions,” March 25, 2013.\n5\n\nCharles Calomiris and Richard Herring, “How to Design a Contingent Convertible Debt Requirement That Helps\nSolve Our Too-Big-to-Fail Problem,” Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, Spring 2013, 25(2):21-44 (publication\nforthcoming) includes a table summarizing the main elements of most proposals. See also Charles I. Plosser,\nremarks to the Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum: Policy Lessons from the Economic and Financial Crisis, Philadelphia,\nPA, December 4, 2009, and Charles I. Plosser, “Convertible Securities and Bankruptcy Reforms: Addressing Too Big\nto Fail and Reducing the Fragility of the Financial System,” remarks to the Conference on the Squam Lake Report:\nFixing the Financial System, New York, NY, June 16, 2010, for more on the value of these instruments.\n\n6\n\nCoCos with market-based triggers set at high levels provide a form of prompt corrective action using market\nforces, rather than relying on regulatory forces alone. Of course, I expect that regulators would take heed when a\nfirm nears conversion.\n7\n\nSome economists have pointed out the risk that CoCos can lead to multiple equilibria, but as shown in Calomiris\nand Herring (2013), there are ways to address such an issue.\n\n5\n\n\fbe less costly than equity capital or long-term subordinated debt. More important, this\napproach provides the firm with choices about how and when to raise capital, with market\nprices functioning as an important signal. This gives firms and markets a key role in keeping\nfinancial institutions healthy, thus reducing the burden on regulators to monitor and prescribe\nremedial action on a real-time basis.\nPlace Greater Weight on Simple Leverage Ratios\nPerhaps more important than how to measure capital is how to measure assets. Basel II and III\nemphasize risk-weighted assets as the primary measure of the asset base and focus on the ratio\nof Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets as the core measure of capital adequacy. There is\nprobably no better example of rule writing that violates the basic principles of simple, robust\nregulation than risk-weighted capital calculations. Haldane and Maldouros provide a rough\nestimate of the increasing complexity of the Basel rules by using the number of pages of\ndocumentation for each successive Basel accord. Basel I had 30 pages of documentation on\nrisk-weighting. Basel II increased that to 347 pages. And now Basel III requires 616 pages to\nprovide guidance on risk-weighted capital. 8 We have a wealth of examples in which riskweighted capital rules have permitted very risky activities by institutions with little or no\ncapital. 9 In addition, there is evidence that even for relatively simple portfolios the measure of\nrisk-weighted assets can vary significantly across banks. 10\nThe problems with risk-weighted capital requirements suggest that we should move to a\nsimpler, more transparent approach. I would prefer more emphasis on the simple leverage\n8\n\nSee Haldane and Madouros (2012).\n\n9\n\nSee, for example, Acharya, Schnabl, and Suarez’s account of the collapse of the asset-backed commercial paper\nmarket. Viral V. Acharya, Philipp Schnabl, and Gustavo Suarez, “Securitization Without Risk Transfer,” Journal of\nFinancial Economics, March 2013.\n\n10\n\nResearchers at the Bank of International Settlements conducted an experiment to see how a relatively simple\nportfolio of long and short positions would be treated for calculating risk-weighted capital at 16 global banks. They\nfound wide variations, even for these simple portfolios. Interestingly, although the banks’ own models were a\nsignificant source of variation, the largest source of variation was different regulatory treatments by the banks’\nhome country regulators. “Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP) — Analysis of Risk-Weighted\nAssets for Market Risk,” BIS (Jan 2013).\n\n6\n\n\fratio — the ratio of capital to unweighted assets. 11 Specifically, we should adopt a framework\nthat relies on simple but higher leverage ratios. We should also require these simple ratios to\nincrease with the size, interconnectedness, and complexity of the institution. This means that\nrequired leverage ratios rise with the size and complexity of the institution. Regulators would\nworry less about what activities or products a firm could engage in but would impose a “tax” in\nthe form of more capital for becoming more systemically important.\nWe should be aware that higher capital requirements may drive activities outside the regulated\nbanking sector or that U.S. banks would become less competitive if capital requirements were\nhigher here than in other countries. However, we should keep in mind that increasing capital\nrequirements for SIFIs permits banks to engage in arbitrage by shrinking and becoming less\ninterconnected, precisely the intention of the increased capital charges. But that will be the\ndecision of the firm and the marketplace based on economies of scale and other efficiency\nconsiderations, not on regulatory dictates. Also, current analyses suggest that even\nsignificantly higher capital requirements are unlikely to be prohibitively costly. 12\nA New Bankruptcy Mechanism\nRequiring SIFIs to hold significantly more capital can reduce the probability of failure, but it\ncannot and should not eliminate all risk of failure. When a troubled bank cannot recapitalize\nitself in private markets, we need a credible mechanism to resolve the failing firm without a\n\n11\n\nSee Thomas M. Hoenig, “Basel III Capital: A Well-Intended Illusion,” speech to the International Association of\nDeposit Insurers, April 9, 2013, and William Poole, “Banking Reform: A Free Market Perspective,” speech to the\n31st Annual Monetary and Trade Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, April 17, 2013. Hoenig has\nargued that the simple leverage ratio be the primary measure of capital adequacy and that risk-weighted assets be\nused as a supplementary regulatory tool, precisely reversing the Basel ordering.\n12\n\nHanson, Kashyap, and Stein estimate that a 10-percentage-point increase in a bank’s tier-1-to-risk-weightedcapital ratio would raise its weighted average cost of capital by 25 to 45 basis points. Baker and Wurgler arrive at\nthe somewhat higher range of 60 to 90 basis points. See Samuel Hanson, Anil Kashyap, and Jeremy Stein, “A\nMacroprudential Approach to Financial Regulation,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, 25 (1), Winter 2011, and\nMalcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler, “Would Stricter Capital Requirements Raise the Cost of Capital? Bank Capital\nRegulation and the Low Risk Anomaly,” Working paper, New York University, March 15, 2013.\n\n7\n\n\fbailout. I believe that the orderly resolution authority of Dodd-Frank’s Title II is a step forward\nbut falls short.\nI do not want to go into detail here, but let me outline some of the main elements of DoddFrank’s approach. The orderly liquidation authority can be invoked only when the Federal\nReserve and another regulator petition the Treasury (and ultimately the President) to take the\nfirm into receivership because it poses systemic concerns. Under Title II, the FDIC is given\nexpansive discretionary powers. Notably, the FDIC can draw on Treasury funds to pay off\ncreditors if the FDIC believes that this is necessary to prevent systemic risk problems. 13\nWhile Title II improves our ability to wind down SIFIs, it is ultimately biased toward bailouts.\nRemember that Title II resolution is available only when there are concerns about systemic risk.\nJust imagine the highly political issue of determining whether a firm is systemically important,\nespecially if it has not been designated so by the Financial Stability Oversight Committee\nbeforehand. The delay in making this determination will make the firm harder to resolve and\nlikely lead to some sort of bailout.\nThe discretionary aspect of Title II also makes it subject to other political pressures. Creditors\nwill perceive that their payoffs will be determined through a regulatory resolution process,\nwhich could be influenced through political pressure rather than subject to the rule of law. This\ngenerates uncertainty, lacks transparency, and will ultimately undermine the effectiveness of\nmarket discipline.\nA new bankruptcy mechanism customized for financial firms and applicable to all financial\nfirms, whether systemically important or not, could alleviate most of the potential problems\ncaused by the discretionary and targeted nature of Title II. 14 By being more systematic and\n13\n\nTo be clear, these powers are not unlimited. Indeed, by law, the FDIC must claw back the money for any\nprivileged creditors who receive more than they would have received in a straight liquidation if the resolution\nleads to losses for the Treasury.\n\n14\n\nThis partially addresses another dilemma for macroprudential regulation. Economists and regulators have yet to\ncome up with a clear definition of what “systemically important” really means.\n\n8\n\n\frule-like, a bankruptcy resolution framework would largely eliminate the potential for bailouts,\nthereby increasing the firm’s incentives to avoid actions that might result in bankruptcy.\nOne proposed bankruptcy mechanism is to add a new Chapter 14 to the Bankruptcy Code. 15\nUnder this system, a specialized federal judge, who could call upon the expertise of a special\nmaster, would oversee the resolution process. While the FDIC, or another regulator, could\ntrigger a bankruptcy filing and would be one of the participants, ultimate decision-making\nwould rest with the judge. Judicial authority, rather than regulatory discretion, would\ndetermine any deviations from absolute priority. The opportunities for drawing on Treasury\nfunds would be more limited and carefully circumscribed.\nLet me be clear. I prefer that a specialized bankruptcy resolution mechanism like Chapter 14\nsupplant Title II, not supplement it. The coexistence of two separate resolution mechanisms\npresents difficulties. Most notably, once a firm has entered bankruptcy, regulators might\nnonetheless invoke Title II. This possibility will certainly complicate managers’ and claimants’\nexpectations and incentives. That said, if a bankruptcy resolution mechanism for financial firms\nwere offered, I believe that both regulators and firms may prefer to avoid Title II in most\ncircumstances. In particular, bankruptcy could be employed without raising the threat of\nsystemic risk, which is necessary to invoke Title II. So, while I believe that a resolution regime\nwith Chapter 14 could fully supplant Title II, a regime with Chapter 14 supplementing Title II is a\nsignificant improvement over one with Title II alone.\nConclusion\nCan we reduce financial fragility by ending too big to fail? I think we can, but I believe the\ncurrent efforts may come up short. Importantly, we should seek to increase capital buffers for\nfinancial institutions and to simplify capital regulation by reducing or eliminating the everincreasing complexity of risk-weighted capital calculations. Furthermore, if we are to end\n15\n\nSee Thomas H. Jackson, “Bankruptcy Code Chapter 14: A Proposal,” February 2012 and Thomas H. Jackson and\nDavid A.

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nNote: President Plosser presented similar remarks on May 14, 2013, before the SNS\n(Center for Business and Policy Studies) and the SIFR (The Institute for Financial\nResearch) in Stockholm, Sweden.\nIntroduction\nIt is a pleasure to be here with my colleague, Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston, to continue this distinguished series of conferences on central\nbanking hosted by the Global Interdependence Center (GIC). David Kotok, Michael\nDrury, and Ben Craig have gathered another impressive group of policymakers,\nacademics, and economists to discuss the state of our recovery.\nYou may know that the GIC has been based in Philadelphia for more than 30 years, and\nfor the past year, it has been a tenant in our building. I am assured that fact has had no\ninfluence on the order of our speakers this morning.\nAround the world, central bankers and policymakers more generally have been\nchallenged over the past five years as they struggled in the face of the worst global\nrecession since the Great Depression. Thankfully, many economies around the world are\nnow in modest recoveries. Yet no one can be satisfied with the pace of these recoveries.\nI have often described the progress of this global recovery as two steps forward and one\nstep back again. Europe has particularly struggled, and many challenges remain.\n\n1\n\n\fThis morning, I am going to concentrate on the outlook for the U.S. economy, which is\nnow nearing the fourth anniversary of an economic recovery that officially began in mid2009. Before I begin, though, I must note that the views I express here are my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic Conditions\nI will start with a discussion of inflation, since in my view, preserving price stability is the\nmost important function of a central bank. In a world of fiat money, monetary policy has\nthe ultimate responsibility for preserving the purchasing power of a nation's currency.\nThat is not to say that central bankers have always lived up to that responsibility. Over\nthe 100-year history of the Federal Reserve, for instance, its price stability record has\nbeen mixed. At times, the Federal Reserve has been successful, but at other times, it has\nnot. Federal Reserve policy contributed to the dramatic deflation of the 1930s, and it\nstoked the rapid inflation of the 1970s.\nHowever, economists and central bankers have learned from the past. The U.S. has seen\nbetter inflation outcomes over the past 20 years. From 1972 to 1992, the average\ninflation rate in the U.S., as measured by the personal consumption expenditure, or PCE,\nprice index was about 5.5 percent, largely reflecting the impact of the Great Inflation\nepisode of the 1970s and the subsequent transition to lower inflation during the 1980s.\nBut in the two decades since 1992, inflation has averaged around 2 percent per year.\nWhile these averages mask some variability, I believe the numbers suggest that the Fed\nhas done a better job of achieving its objective of stable inflation in recent decades.\nIn January 2012, the FOMC announced, for the first time, an explicit long-run inflation\ntarget of 2 percent a year for the PCE price index. Being explicit about our inflation\nobjective enhances the credibility of the Fed’s commitment to price stability, which\nhelps anchor inflation expectations and foster price stability and moderate long-term\ninterest rates.\n2\n\n\fOver the past three years, average PCE inflation in the U.S. has been running about 1.8\npercent, a bit below our 2 percent target. Although inflation has been running\nsomewhat lower than this over the past four quarters, I expect it to return to our goal\nover the next year or two, as inflation expectations remain fairly well anchored near our\ngoal. In fact, the participants in the Survey of Professional Forecasters released by the\nPhiladelphia Fed just last week expected annual-average PCE inflation of 2 percent over\nthe next 10 years. Should inflation expectations begin to fall, we might need to take\naction to defend our inflation goal, but at this point, I do not see inflation or deflation as\na serious threat in the near term. However, I do believe that our extraordinary level of\nmonetary accommodation will have to be scaled back, perhaps more aggressively than\nsome think, to ensure that inflation over the medium term remains consistent with our\ntarget.\nLet me turn now to other aspects of the U.S. economy, including the prospects for\ngrowth and employment.\nAccording to the advance estimate of GDP for the first quarter of this year, U.S.\neconomic growth rebounded to an annualized rate of 2.5 percent following a weak 0.4\npercent growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the composition of that growth\nwas encouraging. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S.\neconomy, made a solid contribution to growth, expanding at an annualized rate of 3.2\npercent. This is the fastest rate of growth from consumers in two years and marks the\nfourth consecutive quarter of acceleration in spending growth. Some economists\nworried that the hike in the federal payroll tax at the beginning of 2013 would constrain\nconsumer spending, but that has yet to materialize.\nHowever, uncertainty over fiscal policy and doubts about the strength of the recovery\nappear to be dampening growth in business investment spending. This spending grew at\nless than a 4 percent annual rate in the first quarter compared with over 7 percent last\nyear. Home construction has been more encouraging. Private residential investment\nregistered its third consecutive quarter of annualized double-digit growth. These growth\n3\n\n\frates may sound more impressive than they are – we have to remember that housing\nactivity, including home sales and starts, remains relatively low by historical standards.\nNevertheless, housing does appear to be in a sustainable recovery, and house prices are\nrising. In the U.S., we follow several indexes for house prices. In February, both the\nCase-Shiller and Federal Housing Finance Agency home price indexes posted their\nhighest year-over-year gains since mid-2006. Higher home prices will help strengthen\nthe balance sheet of consumers, supporting consumption and new home construction.\nHowever, I do not believe we are going to see, nor should we seek to see, a return to\nthe heady days of residential real estate activity that preceded the financial crisis.\nGovernment spending, particularly in defense, has declined notably over the past three\nyears. These declines reflect fiscal policy decisions and budgetary timelines, not business\ncycles. Netting out the decline in government spending, the private sector portions of\nGDP advanced at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the first quarter.\nOverall, the U.S. economy is growing at a pace that is close to trend. My forecast is that\nthe pace of growth in the U.S. will pick up to slightly above trend and average close to 3\npercent through 2014. Based on the Federal Open Market Committee’s most recent\nSummary of Economic Projections, my outlook for 2013 is a little higher than the central\ntendency and on the lower end of the central tendency for 2014.\nMy forecast of 3 percent growth should allow for continued improvements in labor\nmarket conditions, including a gradual decline in the unemployment rate, similar to the\ntrend we have seen over the past three years, which was a 0.7- to 0.8-percentage point\ndecline per year. Continuing at such a pace would lead to an unemployment rate close\nto 7 percent at the end of 2013 and a rate below 6.5 percent by the end of 2014.\nIndeed, this year we have already seen the unemployment rate fall from 7.9 percent in\nJanuary to 7.5 percent in April. Employers added 165,000 jobs in April, but the more\npositive news came in the revisions for February and March. The revised data indicate\n\n4\n\n\fthat firms added 332,000 jobs in February and 138,000 in March. The upward revisions\nfor these two months added 114,000 jobs.\nLet me now turn to the implications for monetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nOver the past five years, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks have taken\nextraordinary actions to support the economic recovery. The Fed has lowered its policy\nrate – the federal funds rate – to essentially zero, where it has stayed for more than four\nyears. Since the policy rate cannot go lower, the Fed has attempted to provide even\nmore accommodation through large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing. These\npurchases have greatly expanded the size and lengthened the maturity of the assets on\nthe Fed’s balance sheet.\nIn addition, the Fed has provided “forward guidance” on the future path of interest\nrates. Specifically, it has indicated that as long as the outlook for inflation over the oneto two-year horizon does not move above 2.5 percent and inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored and as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent, the\nCommittee expects to keep the federal funds rate at essentially zero. The Committee\nhas also indicated that it anticipates that the highly accommodative stance of monetary\npolicy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery\nstrengthens.\nCurrently, the Fed is purchasing $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities and\n$45 billion of longer-term Treasury securities each month. The Fed is also reinvesting\nthe proceeds of maturing or prepaid mortgage-backed securities and is rolling over\nmaturing Treasury securities at auction. As a result, the Fed’s balance sheet, which\nincludes about $3.3 trillion in assets, is growing at a pace of about $85 billion a month.\nThese purchases of longer-maturity assets are intended to put downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates in the hope that households and businesses will choose to\n5\n\n\fspend today rather than save. Whatever one’s views of the benefits, these changes in\nthe size and composition of the balance sheet pose challenges for the Fed’s eventual\nexit from this period of extraordinary accommodation and for the normalization of\nmonetary policy.\nOf course, before the Fed can begin to implement any sort of exit from the massive\nvolume of accommodation it has put in place, it must stop its attempts to increase\naccommodation through its ongoing asset purchase program. I was not in favor of the\nSeptember and December decisions to further grow the balance sheet because I\nbelieved that the costs exceeded the expected benefits. Nevertheless, the Committee\nchose to establish the current open-ended asset purchase program that would adapt to\nchanging economic conditions, with particular attention to the labor market.\nThe FOMC has provided forward guidance about its asset purchases. In particular, the\nCommittee has indicated that it anticipates it will continue to purchase these assets\nuntil there is substantial improvement in labor markets in a context of price stability.\nBut the most recent FOMC statement also made clear that the Committee is prepared\nto increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain its assessment of\nappropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation\nchanges. In addition, in determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset\npurchases, the Committee continues to weigh the likely efficacy and costs of such\npurchases, as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.\nBased on the stated views of the Committee regarding the flexibility in pace of\npurchases, I believe that labor market conditions warrant scaling back the pace of\npurchases as soon as our next meeting. Moreover, unless we see a significant reversal in\ncurrent trends that jeopardizes my forecast of near 7 percent unemployment rate by\nthe end of this year, then I anticipate that we could end the program before year-end.\nLet’s look at some of the data.\n\n6\n\n\fIn the six months through September 2012, when the decision to initiate the latest\nopen-ended asset purchase program was made, nonfarm payrolls had increased an\naverage of 130,000 per month, and the unemployment rate had averaged 8.1 percent.\nIn the most recent six months, from November 2012 through April 2013, nonfarm\npayrolls have increased on average 208,000 per month – a 60 percent increase – and\nthe unemployment rate has averaged 7.7 percent. As I noted earlier, April’s\nunemployment rate has now reached 7.5 percent.\nMoreover, the average duration of unemployment has fallen, the share of long-term\nunemployment has dropped, and hours worked and earnings have risen. While further\nprogress would certainly be desirable, I believe the evidence is consistent with a\nsignificantly improving labor market. Thus, it is appropriate to begin scaling back the\npace of asset purchases.\nIndeed, in my view, were the FOMC to refrain from reducing the pace of its purchases in\nthe face of this evidence of improving labor market conditions, it would undermine the\ncredibility of the Committee’s statement that the pace of purchases will respond to\neconomic conditions. Similarly, if there were sufficient evidence that conditions in labor\nmarkets had deteriorated, I would expect the FOMC to consider increasing the pace of\npurchases. After all, this is the meaning of state-contingent monetary policymaking. But\nif we reach the point that markets only expect us to move in one direction – that is,\ntoward more easing – and we become reluctant to dial back on purchases over concerns\nof disappointing or surprising markets, then we will find ourselves in a very difficult\nposition going forward.\nI want to emphasize that in this state-contingent framework, reducing the pace or even\nending asset purchases need not be the start of an exit strategy or more aggressive\ntightening. Nor would it indicate that an increase in the policy rate was imminent.\nInstead, these actions would slow and then halt efforts to continuously expand the level\nof accommodation by increasing the size of the balance sheet. Given the improving\neconomy, dialing back asset purchases is an appropriate response.\n7\n\n\fI think we should also consider rethinking our reinvestment strategy. There are no\nlonger any short-term Treasuries in the Fed’s portfolio. Rather than reinvesting\nmaturing and prepaid assets into longer-term assets, it might be prudent to reinvest\ninto shorter-term assets. That would provide more flexibility in managing our balance\nsheet as we move forward.\nSo let me offer some thoughts about exit.\nReconsidering the Exit Strategy\nLast month, I recounted some principles that I first shared in March 2011, which I\nbelieve should guide the Fed’s eventual exit from its highly accommodative policies. 1\nMy preference is that the Fed should seek to return monetary policy to an operating\nframework in which the federal funds rate is the primary policy instrument. In my\npreferred policy framework, the federal funds rate target would be set in a corridor\nabove the interest rate paid on excess reserves and below the discount rate (also called\nthe primary credit rate). This corridor system is similar to the system that the Fed used\nbefore the crisis and is similar to corridor systems used by other central banks around\nthe world.\nAn alternative framework would have the Fed use the interest rate on excess reserves\nas its policy rate to establish a floor for market rates. In this floor system, monetary\npolicy could be implemented with no limit on the size of the Fed’s balance sheet. I am\nskeptical of such an approach and prefer the corridor system, in part because it\nconstrains the size of the balance sheet, thereby making it less likely that the Fed’s\nbalance sheet could be used for purposes outside the purview of monetary policy and\nbecause the fed funds rate is a market interest rate.\n\n1\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Reconsidering EXIT,” remarks at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, April 16,\n2013, and “Exit,” Remarks to the Shadow Open Market Committee, March 25, 2011.\n\n8\n\n\fTo ensure that the fed funds rate trades above the interest rate on excess reserves,\nnormalization will require a significant reduction in the volume of reserves in the\nbanking system, which will result in a much smaller balance sheet for the Fed. The\nextent of that reduction will depend on the amount of reserves in the system when we\nbegin to tighten policy. Currently, reserves total more than $1.8 trillion and are growing.\nThey were only about $25 billion before the crisis.\nI also believe that normalization should include returning the composition of the Fed’s\nportfolio to mostly short-term U.S. Treasury securities, as it was prior to the crisis. This\nmeans that mortgage-backed securities on the Fed’s balance sheet would have to be\neliminated. They could be allowed to run off via maturity or prepayment, or the Fed\ncould sell these assets.\nThe framework I first proposed in March 2011 is largely consistent with the exit strategy\nprinciples that the Committee announced a few months later in June 2011. And while a\nlot has changed since then, I believe these general principles still apply. In particular, we\nshould seek to return to operating in a corridor system, where the fed funds rate is the\nprimary policy instrument. The balance sheet should shrink in size to enable such a\nsystem to operate. And the composition of the Fed’s balance sheet should return to all\nU.S. Treasuries.\nThe specific timing and sequence of the steps detailed in the FOMC’s exit strategy\nannouncement may require some adjustments in light of the larger, and still growing,\nsize of our balance sheet. If asset purchases continue at current levels, reserve balances\ncould grow to $2.25 trillion or more. That may require the Fed to sell assets at a\nsomewhat faster pace than contemplated in 2011. Faster sales of assets also would\nheighten the risk that the Fed would sell longer-term assets at a loss, which would affect\nthe Fed’s remittances to the Treasury. There might even be negative remittances. While\nthat would not impair the Fed’s ability to implement monetary policy, it would certainly\nbe noticed, especially at a time when the federal government and the public are keenly\n\n9\n\n\ffocused on the need to reduce deficits. This would also come at a time when the Fed is\npaying higher interest to banks on their reserve balances at the Fed.\nThe complexity of shrinking the balance sheet is nuanced. It involves interactions among\nthe overall size and composition of the balance sheet, the pace at which interest rates\nmay have to rise, the effectiveness of interest on reserves and other reserve-draining\ntools, and the sensitivities to the prospects of negative remittances to the U.S. Treasury.\nWe are in uncharted territory in this regard and should be appropriately cautious in\nspecifying too detailed a path that we may not be able to follow.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the U.S. economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, and I believe that\nthe fundamentals continue to gradually improve, thus supporting my projection of\nannual growth of around 3 percent in 2013 and 2014.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve gradually, but I believe we may see\nrates near 7 percent by the end of this year and a rate below 6.5 percent by the end of\n2014. I believe inflation expectations will be relatively stable and inflation will remain at\nmoderate levels in the near term.\nEventually, economic conditions will improve to the point at which the Fed will need to\nbegin to exit from this period of extraordinary accommodation and normalize its\nframework for monetary policy. Although there have been significant changes in\nmonetary policy and the balance sheet over the past two years, I generally subscribe to\nthe exit strategy principles adopted by the FOMC in June 2011.\nYet the timing and pace of the exact steps may have to be adjusted, given the changes in\nour balance sheet since June 2011. But one thing is certain: A precursor to an exit must\nbe to slow and then halt the continued expansion of the balance sheet. This would not\nnecessarily indicate that increases in the policy rate were imminent. Rather, it would\nindicate that efforts to increase accommodation were coming to a close. The FOMC’s\n10\n\n\fforward guidance is that asset purchases will be increased or decreased based on the\noutlook for labor markets and inflation and that purchases will end when we have seen\nsubstantial improvement in the labor market conditions in a context of price stability.\nIn my view, labor market conditions have improved sufficiently for the Fed to reduce the\npace of its asset purchases. Should labor market conditions and inflation continue to\nevolve as I project, then I would view ending the purchases by year-end as appropriate.\nIn fact, I believe the FOMC would undermine the credibility of its own statement if it\nfails to adjust the pace of asset purchases in response to economic conditions.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nI am delighted to be here in Stockholm, so close to the world’s oldest central bank. Later\nthis year, the Federal Reserve System, the central bank of the United States, will observe\nits 100-year anniversary. The Federal Reserve Act was signed on December 23, 1913. In\ncontrast, the Riksbank traces its roots back to 1668 and is now in its fourth century as a\ncentral bank.\nOur concepts of central banking and the field of macroeconomics have matured over\nthe centuries, and in many ways, the Riksbank has been at the forefront of advancing\nsound central banking practices.\nOf course, despite the progress that has been made in the science of monetary policy,\nthe recent financial crisis and the deep recession that followed have posed enormous\nchallenges to central bankers and policymakers more generally. Fortunately, many\neconomies around the world are now in modest recoveries. Yet no one is particularly\nsatisfied, and growth prospects remain uncertain in many parts of the world. This\nmorning, I am going to concentrate on the outlook for the U.S. economy, which has\nofficially been in recovery since mid-2009 – almost four years. Before I begin, I must\nnote that the views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal\n\n1\n\n\fReserve Board of Governors or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nEconomic Conditions\nI will start with a discussion of inflation, since in my view, preserving price stability is the\nmost important function of a central bank.

Based on the Federal Open Market Committee’s most recent\nSummary of Economic Projections, my outlook for 2013 is a little higher than the central\ntendency and on the lower end of the central tendency for 2014.\nMy forecast of 3 percent growth should allow for continued improvements in labor\nmarket conditions, including a gradual decline in the unemployment rate, similar to the\ntrend we have seen over the past three years, which was a 0.7- to 0.8-percentage point\ndecline per year. Continuing at such a pace would lead to an unemployment rate close\nto 7 percent at the end of 2013 and a rate below 6.5 percent by the end of 2014.\nIndeed, this year we have already seen the unemployment rate fall from 7.9 percent in\nJanuary to 7.5 percent in April. Employers added 165,000 jobs in April, but the more\npositive news came in the revisions for February and March. The revised data indicate\nthat firms added 332,000 jobs in February and 138,000 in March. The upward revisions\nfor these two months added 114,000 jobs.\nLet me now turn to the implications for monetary policy.\n4\n\n\fMonetary Policy\nOver the past five years, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks have taken\nextraordinary actions to support the economic recovery. The Fed has lowered its policy\nrate – the federal funds rate – to essentially zero, where it has stayed for more than four\nyears. Since the policy rate cannot go lower, the Fed has attempted to provide even\nmore accommodation through large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing. These\npurchases have greatly expanded the size and lengthened the maturity of the assets on\nthe Fed’s balance sheet.\nIn addition, the Fed has provided “forward guidance” on the future path of interest\nrates. Specifically, it has indicated that as long as the outlook for inflation over the oneto two-year horizon does not move above 2.5 percent and inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored and as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent, the\nCommittee expects to keep the federal funds rate at essentially zero. The Committee\nhas also indicated that it anticipates that the highly accommodative stance of monetary\npolicy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery\nstrengthens.\nCurrently, the Fed is purchasing $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities and\n$45 billion of longer-term Treasury securities each month. The Fed is also reinvesting\nthe proceeds of maturing or prepaid mortgage-backed securities and is rolling over\nmaturing Treasury securities at auction. As a result, the Fed’s balance sheet, which\nincludes about $3.3 trillion in assets, is growing at a pace of about $85 billion a month.\nThese purchases of longer-maturity assets are intended to put downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates in the hope that households and businesses will choose to\nspend today rather than save. Whatever one’s views of the benefits, these changes in\nthe size and composition of the balance sheet pose challenges for the Fed’s eventual\nexit from this period of extraordinary accommodation and for the normalization of\nmonetary policy.\n5\n\n\fOf course, before the Fed can begin to implement any sort of exit from the massive\nvolume of accommodation it has put in place, it must stop its attempts to increase\naccommodation through its ongoing asset purchase program. I was not in favor of the\nSeptember and December decisions to further grow the balance sheet because I\nbelieved that the costs exceeded the expected benefits. Nevertheless, the Committee\nchose to establish the current open-ended asset purchase program that would adapt to\nchanging economic conditions, with particular attention to the labor market.\nThe FOMC has provided forward guidance about its asset purchases. In particular, the\nCommittee has indicated that it anticipates it will continue to purchase these assets\nuntil there is substantial improvement in labor markets in a context of price stability.\nBut the most recent FOMC statement also made clear that the Committee is prepared\nto increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain its assessment of\nappropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation\nchanges. In addition, in determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset\npurchases, the Committee continues to weigh the likely efficacy and costs of such\npurchases, as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.\nBased on the stated views of the Committee regarding the flexibility in pace of\npurchases, I believe that labor market conditions warrant scaling back the pace of\npurchases as soon as our next meeting. Moreover, unless we see a significant reversal in\ncurrent trends that jeopardizes my forecast of near 7 percent unemployment rate by\nthe end of this year, then I anticipate that we could end the program before year-end.\nLet’s look at some of the data.\nIn the six months through September 2012, when the decision to initiate the latest\nopen-ended asset purchase program was made, nonfarm payrolls had increased an\naverage of 130,000 per month, and the unemployment rate had averaged 8.1 percent.\nIn the most recent six months, from November 2012 through April 2013, nonfarm\npayrolls have increased on average 208,000 per month – a 60 percent increase – and\n\n6\n\n\fthe unemployment rate has averaged 7.7 percent. As I noted earlier, April’s\nunemployment rate has now reached 7.5 percent.\nMoreover, the average duration of unemployment has fallen, the share of long-term\nunemployment has dropped, and hours worked and earnings have risen. While further\nprogress would certainly be desirable, I believe the evidence is consistent with a\nsignificantly improving labor market. Thus, it is appropriate to begin scaling back the\npace of asset purchases.\nIndeed, in my view, were the FOMC to refrain from reducing the pace of its purchases in\nthe face of this evidence of improving labor market conditions, it would undermine the\ncredibility of the Committee’s statement that the pace of purchases will respond to\neconomic conditions. Similarly, if there were sufficient evidence that conditions in labor\nmarkets had deteriorated, I would expect the FOMC to consider increasing the pace of\npurchases. After all, this is the meaning of state-contingent monetary policymaking. But\nif we reach the point that markets only expect us to move in one direction – that is,\ntoward more easing – and we become reluctant to dial back on purchases over concerns\nof disappointing or surprising markets, then we will find ourselves in a very difficult\nposition going forward.\nI want to emphasize that in this state-contingent framework, reducing the pace or even\nending asset purchases need not be the start of an exit strategy or more aggressive\ntightening. Nor would it indicate that an increase in the policy rate was imminent.\nInstead, these actions would slow and then halt efforts to continuously expand the level\nof accommodation by increasing the size of the balance sheet. Given the improving\neconomy, dialing back asset purchases is an appropriate response.\nI think we should also consider rethinking our reinvestment strategy. There are no\nlonger any short-term Treasuries in the Fed’s portfolio. Rather than reinvesting\nmaturing and prepaid assets into longer-term assets, it might be prudent to reinvest\n\n7\n\n\finto shorter-term assets. That would provide more flexibility in managing our balance\nsheet as we move forward.\nSo let me offer some thoughts about exit.\nReconsidering the Exit Strategy\nLast month, I recounted some principles that I first shared in March 2011, which I\nbelieve should guide the Fed’s eventual exit from its highly accommodative policies. 1\nMy preference is that the Fed should seek to return monetary policy to an operating\nframework in which the federal funds rate is the primary policy instrument. In my\npreferred policy framework, the federal funds rate target would be set in a corridor\nabove the interest rate paid on excess reserves and below the discount rate (also called\nthe primary credit rate). This corridor system is similar to the system that the Fed used\nbefore the crisis and is similar to corridor systems used by other central banks around\nthe world. In fact, the Riksbank sets its policy overnight rate in an interest-rate corridor\nbetween the deposit rate and the lending rate.\nAn alternative framework would have the Fed use the interest rate on excess reserves\nas its policy rate to establish a floor for market rates. In this floor system, monetary\npolicy could be implemented with no limit on the size of the Fed’s balance sheet. I am\nskeptical of such an approach and prefer the corridor system, in part because it\nconstrains the size of the balance sheet, thereby making it less likely that the Fed’s\nbalance sheet could be used for purposes outside the purview of monetary policy and\nbecause the fed funds rate is a market interest rate.\nTo ensure that the fed funds rate trades above the interest rate on excess reserves,\nnormalization will require a significant reduction in the volume of reserves in the\nbanking system, which will result in a much smaller balance sheet for the Fed. The\n1\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Reconsidering EXIT,” remarks at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, April 16,\n2013, and “Exit,” Remarks to the Shadow Open Market Committee, March 25, 2011.\n\n8\n\n\fextent of that reduction will depend on the amount of reserves in the system when we\nbegin to tighten policy. Currently, reserves total more than $1.8 trillion and are growing.\nThey were only about $25 billion before the crisis.\nI also believe that normalization should include returning the composition of the Fed’s\nportfolio to mostly short-term U.S. Treasury securities, as it was prior to the crisis. This\nmeans that mortgage-backed securities on the Fed’s balance sheet would have to be\neliminated. They could be allowed to run off via maturity or prepayment, or the Fed\ncould sell these assets.\nThe framework I first proposed in March 2011 is largely consistent with the exit strategy\nprinciples that the Committee announced a few months later in June 2011. And while a\nlot has changed since then, I believe these general principles still apply. In particular, we\nshould seek to return to operating in a corridor system, where the fed funds rate is the\nprimary policy instrument. The balance sheet should shrink in size to enable such a\nsystem to operate. And the composition of the Fed’s balance sheet should return to all\nU.S. Treasuries.\nThe specific timing and sequence of the steps detailed in the FOMC’s exit strategy\nannouncement may require some adjustments in light of the larger, and still growing,\nsize of our balance sheet. If asset purchases continue at current levels, reserve balances\ncould grow to $2.25 trillion or more. That may require the Fed to sell assets at a\nsomewhat faster pace than contemplated in 2011. Faster sales of assets also would\nheighten the risk that the Fed would sell longer-term assets at a loss, which would affect\nthe Fed’s remittances to the Treasury. There might even be negative remittances. While\nthat would not impair the Fed’s ability to implement monetary policy, it would certainly\nbe noticed, especially at a time when the federal government and the public are keenly\nfocused on the need to reduce deficits. This would also come at a time when the Fed is\npaying higher interest to banks on their reserve balances at the Fed.\n\n9\n\n\fThe complexity of shrinking the balance sheet is nuanced. It involves interactions among\nthe overall size and composition of the balance sheet, the pace at which interest rates\nmay have to rise, the effectiveness of interest on reserves and other reserve-draining\ntools, and the sensitivities to the prospects of negative remittances to the U.S. Treasury.\nWe are in uncharted territory in this regard and should be appropriately cautious in\nspecifying too detailed a path that we may not be able to follow.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the U.S. economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, and I believe that\nthe fundamentals continue to gradually improve, thus supporting my projection of\nannual growth of around 3 percent in 2013 and 2014.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve gradually, but I believe we may see\nrates near 7 percent by the end of this year and a rate below 6.5 percent by the end of\n2014. I believe inflation expectations will be relatively stable and inflation will remain at\nmoderate levels in the near term.\nEventually, economic conditions will improve to the point at which the Fed will need to\nbegin to exit from this period of extraordinary accommodation and normalize its\nframework for monetary policy. Although there have been significant changes in\nmonetary policy and the balance sheet over the past two years, I generally subscribe to\nthe exit strategy principles adopted by the FOMC in June 2011.\nYet the timing and pace of the exact steps may have to be adjusted, given the changes in\nour balance sheet since June 2011. But one thing is certain: A precursor to an exit must\nbe to slow and then halt the continued expansion of the balance sheet. This would not\nnecessarily indicate that increases in the policy rate were imminent. Rather, it would\nindicate that efforts to increase accommodation were coming to a close. The FOMC’s\nforward guidance is that asset purchases will be increased or decreased based on the\noutlook for labor markets and inflation and that purchases will end when we have seen\nsubstantial improvement in the labor market conditions in a context of price stability.\n10\n\n\fIn my view, labor market conditions have improved sufficiently for the Fed to reduce the\npace of its asset purchases. Should labor market conditions and inflation continue to\nevolve as I project, then I would view ending the purchases by year-end as appropriate.\nIn fact, I believe the FOMC would undermine the credibility of its own statement if it\nfails to adjust the pace of asset purchases in response to economic conditions.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nIt has been nearly three years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act, which called for significant reforms of financial system regulation and\nsupervision. As regulators continue to write thousands of pages of rules to implement the\nvarious provisions of the act, it seems like a good time to ask if we are adequately addressing\nthe issues in most urgent need of reform. Today, I want to focus on one of the most significant\nissues: too big to fail.\nEnding too big to fail was one of the highest priorities of regulatory reform and one of the most\ndifficult to achieve. The idea that a failing financial firm must be rescued to prevent risks to\noverall financial stability is at the heart of the most controversial aspects of the recent financial\ncrisis. Of course, having the government intervene to rescue a private firm is largely anathema\nto the idea of a free market. Just as reaping the rewards of success is an essential incentive\nthat makes a market economy so highly productive, bearing the costs of failure is equally\nimportant and necessary. A real or perceived guarantee that taxpayers would backstop losses\ndistorts effective decision-making, encourages excessive risk-taking, and leads to financial\nfragility.\nToday, I will highlight why I think current efforts may not be sufficient and discuss a twopronged approach to ending the problem of too big to fail. The first aspect of this approach is\nestablishing a framework that permits a large financial institution to, in fact, fail without placing\n1\n\n\fthe financial system at risk. Large financial firms, and particularly their creditors, should not be\nrescued or protected by government guarantees or supports or by regulatory discretion. The\nsecond line of defense that I will discuss is to expect all financial firms to maintain sufficient\nlevels of capital to significantly reduce the ex-ante risk of failure. Increased capital\nrequirements can lower the incentive for financial institutions to become systemically\nimportant and lower the probability that such firms will fail in the first place.\nBut before I turn to specific proposals, I want to step back and reiterate some principles that\nhelp to guide my judgments about the right approach to regulatory reform. I should point out\nthat these are my own views and are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Value of Simple, Robust Regulations\nIn the context of monetary policy, I have long been an advocate of simple, robust rules and\ntransparent communications. 1 Robust rules are important because they are intended to work\nwell in a variety of environments, reflecting our limited knowledge about the true model that\nguides economic outcomes. Economists have also come to understand that using policies that\nare optimal in one specific model can deliver very poor outcomes if that model proves\nincorrect.\nThis cautionary tale applies to the design of regulatory frameworks as well. Although the\nfinancial world is very complex, there is merit in simple, transparent regulatory solutions\ndesigned to work reasonably well in a wide range of situations that are hard to predict. We\nwant rules that regulators can enforce without having superhuman knowledge or foresight.\nHowever, regulators can predict with certainty that private actors will seek to evade regulatory\ntaxes. They also know that enforcement costs rise with firms’ incentives to evade regulatory\ntaxes. In my view, simple mechanisms that are harder to evade – and even better, mechanisms\nthat utilize market forces as an enforcement tool – are superior to an elaborate list of rules that\n\n1\n\nSee, for example, Charles I. Plosser, “Transparency and Monetary Policy,” University of California, Santa Barbara\nEconomic Forecast Project, May 3, 2012, and Charles I. Plosser, “Output Gaps and Robust Policy Rules,” 2010\nEuropean Banking & Financial Forum, Czech National Bank, March 23, 2010.\n\n2\n\n\fseeks to cover every possible outcome. Simple and transparent regulatory mechanisms make it\neasier for market participants to predict how regulators are likely to behave. This, in turn,\nmakes it easier for regulators to credibly commit to implementing these regulations.\nI would also note that as regulation becomes ever more complex, compliance and enforcement\ncosts rise significantly. Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England has argued that regulation of\nthe financial sector is exploding with the cost of compliance and supervision following suit. He\nargues that we could be more effective and more efficient by simplifying our approach to\nregulatory reform.2 I whole-heartedly endorse this general approach.\nThe Problem of Too Big to Fail\nSo let me elaborate on the problem of too big to fail. During the financial crisis, we learned that\nregulators did not have adequate tools for handling the failure of seriously troubled financial\nfirms that were perceived to be systemically important. Our responses to the failures of such\nfirms were inconsistent, to say the least. With Bear Stearns, regulators brokered a sale to\nJPMorgan Chase and provided guarantees to the buyer against losses. While Bear Stearns’\nshareholders were largely wiped out, its creditors were made whole. With Lehman Brothers,\nno sale was brokered, the firm entered bankruptcy, and bondholders suffered significant losses.\nAt nearly the same time, regulators intervened to take over AIG, many of whose creditors and\nlarge derivatives counterparties were made whole.\nThere are many conflicting narratives about this sequence of events, but I think we can all agree\nthat our tools for resolving what we now refer to as systemically important financial institutions\n– or SIFIs – were inadequate. Going forward, without a credible resolution mechanism, the\ncreditors of SIFIs will continue to believe that there is a significant probability that they will be\nbailed out if their firms get into trouble. And the bigger or more central a role the firm plays in\nthe financial markets, the higher the chances of a rescue. Consequently, the creditors of these\ninstitutions have little incentive to exert discipline on the SIFIs’ risk-taking activities, which is, of\n2\n\nAndrew Haldane and Vasileios Madouros, “The Dog and the Frisbee,” the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s\n36th Economic Policy Symposium, “The Changing Policy Landscape,” Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 31, 2012.\n\n3\n\n\fcourse, a traditional role for debt. Thus, an important source of market discipline on these\nfirms is eliminated. Moreover, as long as regulators believe that creditors expect a bailout, they\nare likely to want to satisfy these creditors’ expectations because not doing so could entail\nsignificant risk to the financial system. This is the essence of the too-big-to-fail dilemma. How\ndo we break this cycle of expectations and get out of this trap?\nDodd-Frank’s Solution to Too Big to Fail\nDodd-Frank’s solution to this problem was embodied in Title II of the legislation. In particular,\nDodd-Frank created a new type of resolution mechanism, the Orderly Liquidation Authority.\nTitle II expands the existing authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to\nresolve failing banks to include SIFIs. While there are some merits to Title II, I believe that a\nmore standard bankruptcy mechanism, specialized for financial institutions, would be more\neffective in addressing the too-big-to-fail problem.\nBefore a firm can be resolved under the Title II framework, a majority of the Board of\nGovernors and another regulator (the FDIC, the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation, or the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency) must petition the Treasury, in consultation with the\nPresident of the U.S., to exercise the Title II authority. In order to invoke Title II, the institution\nmust be in or close to default and its failure must present serious adverse effects on U.S.\nfinancial stability.\nAt this point, the FDIC may take the firm, or parts of the firm, into receivership. As the receiver,\nthe FDIC has expansive discretionary powers, including the ability to use Treasury funds to\nmake advances to particular creditors in a manner that may be inconsistent with the legal\npriorities specified in their debt contracts if it believes that this is necessary to prevent systemic\nproblems. 3\n\n3\n\nTo be clear, these powers are not unlimited. Indeed, by law, the FDIC must claw back the money for any\nprivileged creditors who receive more than they would have received in a straight liquidation if the resolution\nleads to losses for the Treasury.\n\n4\n\n\fWhile Title II improves our ability to wind down SIFIs, it affords substantial discretion to\nregulators, which I see as a serious drawback. Remember that Title II resolution is triggered\nonly when there are concerns about systemic problems. On the one hand, by unleashing the\nFDIC’s wide range of discretionary powers, the mechanism may lead to bailouts that are\nunnecessary or to rewarding certain creditors at the expense of others. Worse, these decisions\nmight be made in an arbitrary manner that is inconsistent with the rules of priority. On the\nother hand, the complicated procedure for invoking the FDIC’s Title II authority may lead to\nexcessive delay. Just think about the highly politically charged issue of determining whether a\nfirm is systemically important, especially if it has not been designated as such by the Financial\nStability Oversight Committee – known as FSOC. The longer the delay, the harder it will be to\nultimately resolve the firm without a bailout. In either case, Title II resolution is likely to be\nbiased toward bailouts.\nThe discretionary aspect of Title II also makes it subject to other political pressures. Creditors\nwill perceive that their payoffs will be determined through a regulatory resolution process in\nwhich political pressure can be brought to bear, independent of the rule of law.\nFinally, the discretion entailed in Title II also makes decisions and subsequent outcomes less\npredictable. Thus, the mechanism could induce firms to game the system by taking actions that\nwould place them in the category of firms that would receive a bailout.\nShould We Supplement or Supplant Title II?\nA new bankruptcy mechanism, specialized for financial firms and applicable to all financial\nfirms, whether systemically important or not, could alleviate most of the potential problems\ncaused by the discretionary nature of Title II. 4 By being more systematic and rule-like, a\nbankruptcy resolution would largely eliminate the potential for bailouts. Rather than providing\nfirms with incentives to take actions that might increase their systemic-risk potential, a\n\n4\n\nThis partially addresses another dilemma for macroprudential regulation. Economists and regulators have yet to\ncome up with a clear definition of what “systemically important” really means.\n\n5\n\n\fbankruptcy resolution mechanism would likely increase the firm’s incentives to avoid actions\nthat might result in bankruptcy.\nOne such bankruptcy mechanism proposed is to add a new Chapter 14. 5 Under this system, a\nspecialized federal judge, who could call upon the expertise of a special master, would oversee\nthe resolution process. While the FDIC, or another regulator, could trigger a bankruptcy filing\nand would be one of the participants in the procedure, ultimate decision-making would rest\nwith the judge. Deviations from absolute priority would be cleared through a judicial authority,\nnot through regulatory discretion that is negotiated behind closed doors. The opportunities for\ndrawing on Treasury funds would be more limited and carefully circumscribed.\nChapter 14 would also modify the bankruptcy treatment of repurchase agreements and\nderivatives, which would be treated more like other claims. Counterparties with claims\ncollateralized by illiquid securities would have to petition the bankruptcy judge to take their\ncollateral when a firm goes bankrupt, unlike the treatment under current bankruptcy law or\nTitle II. Furthermore, any extra collateral taken by counterparties within 90 days of the\nbankruptcy would have to be returned to the bankruptcy court, just as collateral is treated for\nother secured claimants. 6 Such changes have the potential to reduce the cost to the taxpayers\nof a financial firm bankruptcy by changing the incentives of financial institutions.\nThese changes would reduce the incentives for stressed firms to take on highly unstable liability\nstructures as a means of forestalling bankruptcy. Counterparties would be wary about\nproviding short-term wholesale funding, for example, or making derivatives trades with a\nstressed firm with illiquid securities as collateral. The sooner a troubled firm enters bankruptcy,\nthe more likely that it can be reorganized or wound down without a bailout. This is a good\n5\n\nSee Thomas H. Jackson, “Bankruptcy Code Chapter 14: A Proposal,” February 2012 and Thomas H. Jackson and\nDavid A. Skeel, Jr., “Dynamic Resolution of Large Financial Institutions,” Institute for Law and Economics, Research\nPaper, No. 13-03.\n\n6\n\nUnder current law, repos and derivatives are exempted from the automatic stay. While all other secured\ncreditors (for example, secured bondholders) must wait until the bankruptcy court has made a judgment so that\nthey may take their collateral, a dealer with a repo agreement can simply net all of its agreements and take any\ncollateral the debtor has put up as margin. Furthermore, the court cannot demand that counterparties return\nadditional collateral taken in the 90 days preceding bankruptcy under current law.\n\n6\n\n\fexample of a regulatory mechanism that uses market discipline and the firm’s own private\nincentives to reduce taxpayer losses.\nSome Caveats\nLet me be clear. I believe that specialized bankruptcy resolution mechanisms like Chapter 14\nshould supplant Title II, not supplement it. The coexistence of two separate resolution\nmechanisms creates some difficulties. Most notably, once a firm has entered bankruptcy,\nregulators might nonetheless invoke Title II. This possibility will certainly complicate managers’\nand claimants’ expectations and incentives. That said, if a bankruptcy resolution mechanism for\nfinancial firms were offered, I believe that both regulators and firms may prefer to avoid Title II\nin most circumstances. In particular, regulators could avoid raising the threat of systemic risk,\nwhich might follow a petition to the President of the U.S. So, while I believe that a resolution\nregime with Chapter 14 could fully supplant Title II, a regime with Chapter 14 supplementing\nTitle II is a significant improvement over one with Title II alone.\nAnother important issue that I have not discussed is the problem of international coordination\nwhen a global firm fails. This is a complicated issue that arises whether resolution occurs\nthrough Title II or through a specialized bankruptcy alternative. While progress is being made,\nmore work needs to be done. 7\nI should also recognize that Dodd-Frank requires bank holding companies with more than $50\nbillion in assets and nonbank financial firms supervised by the Fed to prepare living wills. The\nliving will is a detailed plan for the orderly resolution of the firm under the U.S. bankruptcy code\nin the event of serious distress or failure. The largest financial firms have already submitted the\nfirst round of living wills to the Fed. While requiring firms to plan ahead for their potential\nresolution should simplify the bankruptcy process and enhance the credibility of resolution\nwithout bailouts, I believe that we should be realistic about the limits of living wills. In\nparticular, I have doubts that regulators can realistically expect firms to significantly reorganize\n7\n\nSee the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of England, “Resolving Globally Active, Systemically\nImportant, Financial Institutions,” December 10, 2012.\n\n7\n\n\ftheir internal structure to facilitate their own demise, certainly not in normal times. I do\nbelieve that preparing a living will may open some firms’ eyes to needless complexity in their\ninternal organization. Indeed, we have seen this in the first round of submissions. In addition,\nthe living will should become a part of our prompt corrective program when firms are under\nstress, in effect mimicking the use of prepackaged bankruptcies for nonfinancial firms.\nBank Capital and Too Big to Fail\nLet me turn now to the second prong of eliminating too big to fail – preventive measures that\nreduce the probability that a financial firm will fail in the first place. The most effective\npreventive measure is adequate capital. Requiring financial firms to hold more capital can\nreduce the probability that Title II or Chapter 14 would have to be invoked. It cannot and\nshould not eliminate all risk of failure, which is why higher capital should not be seen as a\ncomplete substitute for a having a well-articulated bankruptcy mechanism.\nOne accomplishment of Dodd-Frank is that it gives regulators the power to assign a capital\nsurcharge for systemically important institutions. In the final analysis, the best protection\nagainst a bailout is for a bank to have sufficient capital to cover its own losses. In addition,\nhigher levels of capital may permit regulatory or market interventions before a firm actually\nfails, thereby making bankruptcy or bailouts unnecessary. However, deciding on what level of\ncapital is required is not trivial. Current Basel III proposals for a SIFI surcharge of 1 to 2.5\npercent may simply be too low.\nIn addition to equity capital, requiring SIFIs to hold subordinated debt instruments, like\ncontingent capital, can provide benefits. The fact that market participants have already been\nadopting contingent convertible bonds (COCOs) in various forms suggests that it might simply\nbe easier to increase capital requirements by reverse convertible debt instruments rather than\nthrough large increases in equity capital. Reverse convertible debt automatically becomes an\n\n8\n\n\fequity claim when, for example, the firm’s capital falls below some trigger. The idea is that the\nfirm’s equity capital automatically increases when it comes under sufficient stress. 8\nMore important than the details of the numerator of the capital asset ratio is the denominator.\nThe Basel II and III emphasis on risk-weighted capital as the primary measure of capital\nadequacy should be seriously reconsidered, with more emphasis on the simple leverage ratio —\nthe ratio of capital to unweighted assets. 9 The primary arguments in favor of leverage ratios\nare straightforward. If we were looking for a regulatory tool that violated the basic principles I\noutlined at the beginning of this talk, i.e., that regulations should be simple and robust, you\ncould hardly find a better example than the risk-weighted capital calculation. Haldane provides\na rough estimate of the increasing complexity of the Basel risk weights using the number of\npages of documentation for each successive Basel accord. The 30 pages of documentation in\nBasel I increased to 347 pages of documentation in Basel II and now to 616 pages in Basel III. 10\nWe have a wealth of examples in which risk weighting has permitted very risky activities by\ninstitutions with little or no capital.11 In addition, there is evidence that even for relatively\nsimple portfolios the measure of risk-weighted assets can vary significantly across banks. 12\n\n8\n\nThe Squam Lake Group has proposed another interesting form of capital, deferred compensation for managers.\nThey suggest that perhaps 20 percent of managers’ compensation be deferred for five years and that this\ncompensation is forfeited if the firm fails (according to some well-defined notion of failure, perhaps the conversion\nof its reverse convertibles). Squam Lake Group, “Aligning Incentives at Systemically Important Financial\nInstitutions,” March 25, 2013.\n\n9\n\nSee Thomas M. Hoenig, “Basel III Capital: A Well-Intended Illusion,” speech to the International Association of\nDeposit Insurers, April 9, 2013, and William Poole, “Banking Reform: A Free Market Perspective,” speech to the\nst\n31 Annual Monetary and Trade Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, April 17, 2013. Hoenig has\nargued that the simple leverage ratio be the primary measure of capital adequacy and that risk-weighted assets be\nused as a supplementary regulatory tool, precisely reversing the Basel ordering.\n10\n\nSee Haldane and Madouros (2012).\n\n11\n\nSee, for example, Acharya, Schnabl, and Suarez’s account of the collapse of the asset-backed commercial paper\nmarket. Viral V. Acharya, Philipp Schnabl, and Gustavo Suarez, “Securitization Without Risk Transfer,” Journal of\nFinancial Economics, March 2013.\n\n12\n\nResearchers at the Bank of International Settlements conducted an experiment to see how a relatively simple\nportfolio of long and short positions would be treated for calculating risk-weighted capital at 16 global banks. They\nfound wide variations, even for these simple portfolios. Interestingly, although the banks’ own models were a\nsignificant source of variation, the largest source of variation was different regulatory treatments by the banks’\n\n9\n\n\fThe measurement issue and complexity of risk-weighted capital requirements suggest to me\nthat we should move to a simpler, more transparent approach. Specifically, we could adopt a\nframework that relies on simple but higher leverage ratios and require them to increase with\nthe size, interconnectedness, and complexity of the institution.\nSome policymakers and commentators have argued that designing mechanisms to resolve\nfinancial organizations without bailouts is largely beside the point. If some financial\norganizations are simply too big to fail, why not break them up into smaller organizations or\nrequire that each of the organization’s entities that is above some critical size, for example,\n$50 billion, be separately capitalized at a relatively high level. On the face of it, these proposals\nmeet the requirements of simplicity and transparency. In addition, I am sympathetic to the\nview that higher capital levels can protect taxpayers and that higher capital requirements\nwould change organizations’ incentives. Nonetheless, I have serious doubts about this\nparticular approach.\nFor example, I don’t think that regulators know enough to break these firms apart. I would\nrather see us pursue higher capital requirements. If that gives firms the incentive to reorganize,\nthen let the firms and the marketplace determine the most efficient structure. This in\ncombination with enforcing bankruptcy would be a better solution in my view.\nSome Remaining Challenges\nLet me end with a few remaining challenges. We should be aware of the risk that activities may\nmove outside the regulated banking sector in response to higher capital charges or that U.S.\nbanks would become less competitive if capital requirements were higher here than in other\ncountries. This is a real concern that is worth considerable thought.\nBut there are reasons that requiring more capital need not lead to an increase in the size of the\nshadow banking system. First, we should keep in mind that increasing capital requirements for\n\nhome country regulators. “Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP ) – Analysis of Risk-Weighted\nAssets for Market Risk,” BIS (Jan 2013).\n\n10\n\n\fSIFIs permits banks to engage in arbitrage by shrinking and becoming less interconnected,\nprecisely the intention of the increased capital charges. Also, current estimates of an increase\nin capital requirements do not suggest that that even significantly higher capital requirements\nwould be prohibitively costly. 13\nRecent Fed proposals to require foreign banking organizations to organize their U.S.\nsubsidiaries under a unified, separately capitalized bank holding company in the U.S. would\nremove the most obvious path to shift regulated activities if capital requirements for U.S. SIFIs\nwere to increase. Greater international cooperation in raising capital requirements will limit\nopportunities for arbitrage.\nConclusion\nCan we end too big to fail? I think we can, but I believe the current efforts may come up short.\nIf we are to end discretionary bailouts and the associated moral hazard problems that they\ncreate, we should seek more rule-like methods to resolve failing firms, such as a new Chapter\n14 bankruptcy mechanism. But we also should accept the idea that more capital is an\nimportant buffer against financial distress. Importantly, we should seek to simplify capital\nregulation and reduce or eliminate the ever-increasing complexity of risk-weighted capital\ncalculations. Finally, we should design regulations that encourage rather than discourage\nmarkets to monitor risk-taking. These steps will provide us with a better chance of ending too\nbig to fail and promote a more stable financial system.\n\n13\n\nHanson, Kashyap, and Stein estimate that a 10-percentage-point increase in a bank’s tier-1-to-risk-weightedcapital ratio would raise its weighted average cost of capital by 25 to 45 basis points.

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be able to share my views at this policy conference\norganized by the Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco and St. Louis and the National\nInstitute for Fiscal Studies at Tsinghua University.\nOver the last five years, monetary policymakers in many countries have ventured into\nuncharted territory by adopting nontraditional policy tools to implement an evergrowing level of monetary accommodation. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has\nlowered its policy rate – the federal funds rate – to essentially zero, where it has stayed\nfor more than four years. Since the policy rate cannot go lower, the Fed has attempted\nto provide additional accommodation through large-scale asset purchases, or\nquantitative easing. These purchases are intended to put downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates to encourage households and businesses to spend today\nrather than save.\nEstimates vary as to how effective these purchases have been in providing meaningful\nstimulus to the U.S. economy. But one thing is certain: These policy actions have greatly\nexpanded the size and have changed the composition of the Fed’s balance sheet. Such\n\n1\n\n\fchanges will pose challenges for the inevitable return of monetary policy to a more\nneutral stance.\nIn March 2011, I shared some principles I thought should guide the Fed’s eventual exit\nfrom this period of extraordinary monetary policy and its attempts to normalize policy.1\nI said at the time that an effective exit strategy had to begin by deciding on our\ndestination — what monetary policy operating framework we will use after exit — and\nthen articulating a systematic approach to getting there. I was gratified that in June of\nthe same year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted a similar set of\nexit principles.\nA lot has changed with respect to the economy and monetary policy over the last two\nyears. So it is entirely appropriate to reconsider the Fed’s exit strategy. Of course, what\nI will discuss today are my own views and should not be construed as those of the\nFederal Reserve or my colleagues on the Committee.\nThe Economy and Monetary Policy Since Mid-2011\nWhen we last considered our exit strategy, in June 2011, the U.S. had seen two years of\neconomic recovery, growth averaged just 2.2 percent, and the unemployment rate had\nfallen from its peak of 10 percent to 9.1 percent. Since then, economic conditions have\nimproved, but the pace has been uneven. Overall growth since June 2011 has remained\nmodest, averaging just 2 percent at an annual rate, but the unemployment rate has\nfallen to 7.6 percent.\nIn June 2011, the Fed was winding down its second round of asset purchases, known as\nQE2. This program entailed the acquisition of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities. Over the course of the spring and summer of 2011, the European sovereign\ndebt crisis had led many economic forecasters and policymakers to worry that global\ngrowth would deteriorate. In addition, the U.S. was confronting its own fiscal debacle\n1\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “EXIT,” Remarks to the Shadow Open Market Committee, March 25, 2011.\n\n2\n\n\fover the debt ceiling, leading to a downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which raised the\nlevel of uncertainty among U.S. businesses and consumers. In an attempt to address\nwhat appeared to be a slowdown in the pace of aggregate demand, the FOMC\nimplemented the Maturity Extension Program, also known as Operation Twist, in\nSeptember 2011. In this program, which remained in place until the end of last year,\nthe Fed bought longer-term Treasuries and sold an equal amount of shorter-term\nTreasuries. While it did not increase the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, it did result in a\nsubstantial change in its composition – indeed, the Fed no longer holds any short-term\nTreasuries in its portfolio.\nThe Fed took further policy action in September 2012. Expressing concern with the pace\nof the recovery, even while the unemployment rate had fallen from 9.0 percent in\nAugust 2011 to 8.1 percent in August 2012, the FOMC implemented the open-ended\nasset purchase program known as QE3. This program began with purchases of $40\nbillion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) per month. In January 2013, it\nincluded purchases of $45 billion in longer-term Treasuries per month. The Fed is also\nreinvesting the proceeds of maturing or prepaid MBS securities into MBS and is rolling\nover maturing Treasury securities at auction. As a result, the Fed’s balance sheet has\nexpanded to about $3.2 trillion in assets and is growing at a pace of about $85 billion a\nmonth.\nIn addition, the FOMC has been using “forward guidance” as a policy tool to signal that\nrates will be kept low for a prolonged period. The forward guidance can be viewed as\nproviding more transparency on the path of the target interest rate that monetary\npolicymakers anticipate taking. This should help households and businesses be better\ninformed about the future course of monetary policy and thus help them make better\neconomic decisions today. In addition, by affecting the public’s expectations about the\nfuture path of policy, this forward guidance can, at least in theory, impact the current\n\n3\n\n\feconomy.2 The form of the forward guidance the FOMC provides has evolved since June\n2011. In August 2011, for example, the FOMC told the public that it anticipated that\neconomic conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels of the funds rate at\nleast through the middle of 2013. The calendar date was extended twice: in January\n2012, the date was extended to late 2014, and last September, it was extended to mid2015.\nThere was some dissatisfaction with using a calendar date as forward guidance. I was\nopposed to its adoption, as I did not think it conveyed information on how the FOMC\nintended to adjust policy in reaction to changes in economic conditions, which was the\nmore relevant basis for changing policy – not the calendar. As a result, such calendarbased guidance was open to misinterpretation. Indeed, many observers inferred from\nthe date-based guidance that the Fed had a very pessimistic outlook on the economy.\nTo partly address this issue, in December 2012, the FOMC changed its calendar-date\nforward guidance to state-contingent forward guidance, in the form of thresholds for\nunemployment and inflation. While I thought the move to state contingency was an\nimprovement, my preference would have been to convey more information about the\nFOMC’s reaction function rather than to focus on specific values for unemployment and\ninflation, which might (or might not) trigger the FOMC to change its policy.\nThe FOMC has also offered forward guidance for its open-ended asset purchase\nprogram. It has indicated that purchases will continue until the outlook for the labor\nmarket has improved substantially in the context of price stability. The Committee\nnoted that it will take into account both the benefits and the costs of the purchases in\ndetermining their size, pace, and composition.\nAs a result of the Fed’s policy actions, the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, as I indicated a\nmoment ago, is now much larger than it was before the crisis and is growing. Moreover,\ninstead of holding 91 percent Treasury securities as we did in July 2007, we now hold\n2\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Forward Guidance,” Remarks at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy\nResearch’s (SIEPR) Associates Meeting, February 12, 2013.\n\n4\n\n\fjust 56 percent Treasuries, with the remainder in agency mortgage-backed securities.\nInstead of holding 32 percent of its portfolio in Treasury bills, today there are no\nTreasury bills and the duration of the Fed’s Treasury portfolio has lengthened from\nabout three years to about eight years.\nExit Principles\nIn March 2011, I stressed that to develop an appropriate exit strategy, it is important to\nknow where we are going – that is, what we want our monetary policy operating\nframework to look like once policy has been normalized. The changes in the balance\nsheet since then have not altered my view of the key elements of that framework.\nFirst, I believe we should seek to return to a framework in which the overnight interbank\nrate – that is, the federal funds rate – is the primary instrument of monetary policy.\nHowever, in my preferred policy framework, the federal funds rate target would be set\nin a corridor bounded below by the interest rate paid on reserves (IOR), which the Fed\nhas been authorized to do since 2008, and bounded above by the discount rate, the rate\nat which banks can borrow at the Fed’s discount window.3 For this framework to work,\nthe supply of reserves must be small enough so that reserves trade at the targeted\nfunds rate above the IOR. This requirement, then, places a limit on the size of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet. This corridor system is similar to the system that the Fed used before the\nfinancial crisis; the only difference is that then, by law, the IOR was zero. It is also\nsimilar to arrangements found in many other central banks around the world.\nBut the ability to pay interest on reserves allows the FOMC to consider a different\noperating system. In particular, the Fed could use the interest rate on reserves as its\npolicy rate, rather than the federal funds rate, to establish a floor for market rates. This\nframework implies that the size of the Fed’s balance sheet is technically indeterminate\n3\n\nThe Fed is permitted to pay different interest rates on required reserves and excess reserves. When the\nrates differ, the rate paid on excess reserves establishes the lower bound in the corridor system, but we\ncan ignore that complication here.\n\n5\n\n\fand could expand to be very large without necessarily affecting the implementation of\nmonetary policy.\nWhile operating a floor system will be necessary until the balance sheet has shrunk\nsignificantly, I do not see it as desirable in the long run and I would prefer the corridor\nsystem. First, as a matter of principle, I believe that central banks should face\nconstraints on their ability to expand their balance sheets, especially in normal times.4\nSuch constraints serve as a commitment device against using the balance sheet for\npurposes other than for monetary policy and thus can help maintain the central bank’s\npolitical independence to conduct monetary policy. Second, the funds rate is more\nfamiliar to markets and policymakers. The IOR is an administered rate rather than a\nmarket rate, so it would supply less feedback about market conditions than a funds rate\ntarget. Third, as a matter of governance, the IOR is determined by the Board of\nGovernors and not the FOMC. I would prefer to keep monetary policy under the\npurview of the FOMC.\nThe second characteristic of the desired operating environment follows from the first.\nTo ensure that the funds rate constitutes a viable policy instrument and thus is above\nthe IOR, the volume of reserves in the banking system must shrink to the point where\nthe demand for reserves is consistent with the targeted funds rate. This will require a\nsignificant reduction in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet. The extent of that reduction\nwill depend on the amount of reserves present when the time comes to begin\ntightening policy. Currently, reserves total more than $1.8 trillion. They averaged less\nthan $25 billion over the decade before the onset of the crisis. Even if we expect\nreserve balances to be somewhat higher in a regime with a higher IOR, the Fed would\nstill need a significant reduction in reserve balances.\n\n4\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “A Credible Commitment to Normalization,” Remarks at the Conference on Capital\nMarkets in the Post-Crisis Environment, Global Interdependence Center and the Bank of Finland, Helsinki,\nFinland, June 6, 2011; and Charles I. Plosser, “Credible Commitments and Monetary Policy After the\nCrisis,” Remarks at the Swiss National Bank Monetary Policy Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September\n24, 2010.\n\n6\n\n\fThe third characteristic of my preferred framework addresses the composition of the\nFed’s portfolio and, in particular, the System Open Market Account, or SOMA. I believe\nthat this portfolio should consist predominantly of U.S. Treasury securities and should\nbe concentrated in short-term Treasuries, as it was before the crisis. Thus, the exit\nstrategy must contemplate a significant restructuring of the balance sheet in terms of its\ncomposition and average maturity.\nFOMC Exit Strategy, June 2011\nThe framework I just described is largely consistent with the exit strategy principles the\nFOMC adopted in June 2011. The FOMC went a step further and provided information\non the sequence of steps the Committee would likely follow once normalization begins.\nThe FOMC indicated it would likely begin by ceasing to reinvest some or all of the\npayments of principal and interest in its security holdings.\nThen, at the same time or sometime thereafter, the Committee would modify its\nforward guidance on the path of the fed funds rate and initiate reserve-draining\noperations to support future increases in the funds rate. Subsequently, when economic\nconditions warranted, increases in the funds rate would begin. The strategy\nacknowledged that, for some time during normalization, the interest rate on reserves\nand reserve levels will be used to bring the fed funds rate to its target, until reserve\nbalances are substantially reduced.\nFollowing increases in the fed funds rate and interest on reserves, the Committee would\nbegin selling its agency securities. The pace of sales would be communicated to the\npublic. It would likely be gradual and steady, but it could be adjusted as economic\nconditions warranted.\nA notable aspect of the exit principles is that the Fed’s holdings of mortgage-related\nsecurities would be eliminated over a period of three to five years, minimizing the\nextent to which the SOMA portfolio might affect the allocation of credit across sectors\n7\n\n\fof the economy. This pace would be expected to normalize the size of the SOMA\nportfolio in two to three years, given the size and composition of the balance sheet at\nthe time. The goal would be to reduce the volume of bank reserves to the smallest\nlevels consistent with the efficient implementation of monetary policy.\nReconsidering the Exit Strategy\nSince 2011, the Fed has gone to great lengths to provide more accommodation,\nparticularly in the form of further asset purchases and forward guidance. Nevertheless,\nin my view, the exit principles adopted by the Committee two years ago still apply. In\nparticular, we should still seek to return to operating in a corridor system, where the\nfunds rate is the primary policy instrument, the balance sheet should shrink in size to\nenable such a system to operate, and the composition of the Fed’s balance sheet should\nreturn to all Treasuries.\nThe specific timing and sequence of the steps detailed in the exit strategy may require\nsome adjustments in light of the larger, and still growing, size of the balance sheet. Of\ncourse, an important precursor toward normalization is to stop purchasing more assets.\nI was not in favor of the September and December decisions last year to further grow\nthe balance sheet, as I believed that the costs exceeded the expected benefits.\nNevertheless, the Committee chose to establish the current open-ended asset purchase\nprogram that would adapt to changing economic conditions, with particular attention to\nthe labor market.\nIn addition to stopping asset purchases, the Fed should take two other steps as\nprecursors to exit. First, we should seek to normalize the spread between the discount,\nor primary credit, rate, the rate at which banks borrow from the central bank, and the\ntarget federal funds rate. During the crisis, the Fed reduced the spread from 100 basis\npoints to 25 basis points to ease strains in financial markets by encouraging borrowing\nat the discount window. In February 2010, it increased the discount rate by 25 basis\npoints, so that the spread widened to 50 basis points, where it remains today. More\n8\n\n\fthan three years later, the crisis has passed and the other temporary lending programs\nthe Fed initiated during the height of the crisis have disappeared. Thus, it may be a\nreasonable time to restore the spread to a more normal level.\nSecond, another step that might be taken before exit begins is to rethink our\nreinvestment strategy. There are no longer any short-term Treasuries in the Fed’s\nportfolio. Rather than reinvesting maturing assets and prepaid assets into longer-term\nassets, it might be prudent to begin reinvesting in shorter-term assets. That would\nprovide more flexibility in managing our balance sheet as we move forward.\nIf we do not stop purchases soon, one part of the exit strategy that might need to be\nreconsidered is asset sales. In June 2011, total reserves were about $1.6 trillion, and\ntoday, they are over $1.8 trillion. If asset purchases continue, reserve balances could\ngrow to $2.25 trillion or even more. With a larger balance sheet, it may be necessary to\nsell assets at a somewhat faster pace than contemplated in the June 2011 principles to\neliminate our MBS holdings in three to five years. An alternative is to lengthen the\nperiod over which the Fed anticipates it will hold its MBS.\nDetermining the optimal pace of normalization from a very large and long-duration\nbalance sheet is a complicated task that will depend on the speed with which interest\nrates rise and the size of the balance sheet when normalization commences. One factor\nto consider is the fiscal implications. The large balance sheet has generated significant\ninterest earnings on the Treasuries and agency debt. This has resulted in unusually large\nremittances to the U.S. Treasury over the last several years. For example, from 2003 to\n2008, the Fed returned an average of about $27 billion to the Treasury. From 2009 to\n2012, however, the average annual remittance rose to about $72 billion. Of course, all\nelse being equal, the magnitude of the remittances is reduced by the interest the Fed\npays on reserves.\nOver time as the economy improves, interest rates will rise. Since the Fed’s portfolio\nholds predominantly longer-term securities, interest received will not rise appreciably,\n9\n\n\fbut the interest paid on reserves will have to go up. Roughly speaking, if reserves total\n$2 trillion, remittances to the U.S. Treasury will fall by $20 billion for each 100-basispoint rise in the IOR.\nIn addition, should the Fed choose to sell long-term assets in a rising interest rate\nenvironment, it could experience capital losses. This would further reduce remittances\nto the Treasury. The more aggressively the Fed sells off its assets, the higher the losses\nand the more likely remittances to the Treasury could turn negative for a number of\nyears.5 Although negative remittances would not impair the Fed’s ability to implement\nmonetary policy, they may impose significant political risk for the institution. The Fed\nwould be paying higher amounts of interest to the banks on their reserve balances while\nremitting nothing to the U.S. Treasury. The situation will be noticed, especially at a\ntime when the federal government and the public are keenly focused on the need to\nreduce deficits. This could result in renewed calls to reduce the Fed’s independence to\nset monetary policy. Such a loss of independence would impair our ability to pursue\nprice stability. Thus, the potential for negative remittances as the Fed executes its exit,\nat the very least, poses a communications challenge for the institution.\nAs Chairman Bernanke pointed out in recent testimony, the FOMC might decide to\nrefrain from asset sales as it exits and just let them run off, which is contrary to the exit\nstrategy steps outlined in June 2011.6 This would avoid the risk of negative remittances;\nhowever, it would delay a return to the corridor operating system. It may also have\nimplications for the path of the fed funds rate required during exit and the volume of\npayments to the banks on their holdings of excess reserves.\n\n5\n\nSee Seth B. Carpenter, Jane E. Ihrig, Elizabeth C. Klee, Daniel W. Quinn, and Alexander H. Boote, \"The\nFederal Reserve's Balance Sheet and Earnings: A Primer and Projections,\" Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2013-01, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013).\n6\n\nBen S. Bernanke in response to questions at the hearing on Monetary Policy and the State of the\nEconomy before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, February 27, 2013.\n\n10\n\n\fTo the extent that a large balance sheet is helping to speed the recovery, as some\nbelieve, it would mean that the output gap would close more quickly than if the Fed\nwere holding a smaller balance sheet. This would mean that the desired interest rate\npath during exit might have to be steeper if the Fed followed a strategy that did not\nincorporate asset sales and kept the balance sheet large, than if it sold assets and\nreduced the size of its balance sheet during exit, all else being equal. Of course, the\nexact calibration is highly uncertain. We have little theory or evidence to guide us in\nestablishing a priori the most desirable path of sales. As a result, I am uncomfortable\ndeclaring at this point that we would not engage in sales. Nonetheless, the FOMC will\nneed to fully consider the implications of maintaining a large balance sheet as it\nnavigates its exit from the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation it has applied\nover the past five years.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the nontraditional policy actions taken by the Fed since the onset of the\ncrisis and during the recovery have vastly expanded the size of the Fed’s balance sheet\nand significantly changed the composition of its asset holdings. Eventually, economic\nconditions will improve enough that the Fed will need to begin exiting from this period\nof extraordinary policy accommodation and start normalizing the monetary policy\noperating framework.\nAlthough there have been changes in monetary policy and the balance sheet over the\npast two years, I still generally subscribe to the exit strategy principles laid out by the\nFOMC in June 2011. In particular, we should return to an operating framework in which\nthe federal funds rate is our policy instrument, we should shrink the size of our balance\nsheet consistent with this framework, and we should shorten the duration and return\nthe composition of our portfolio to all Treasuries. The exact steps taken and the timing\nto arrive at this destination have many complexities that are difficult to fully anticipate,\ngiven the very limited theory and evidence we have in operating in these uncharted\nwaters.\n11\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fA Perspective on the U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nMarket News International Seminar\nApril 11, 2013\nHong Kong, China\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nI want to thank Steve Beckner for his kind introduction and Market News International\nfor arranging this evening’s event. It is nice, if a bit unusual, to see Steve on a different\ncontinent, and it’s a pleasure to have this opportunity to share my views of the U.S.\neconomy and monetary policy with all of you.\nAn audience that gathers here at the Hong Kong Bankers Club is well aware of the\nextraordinary economic times in which we live. In the last five years, we have seen a\nfinancial crisis that led to, arguably, the worst global recession since the Great\nDepression. Thankfully, many economies around the world are now in modest\nrecoveries. Yet, this episode has made us much more aware of how interconnected the\nworld economy has become. But this evening I am going to concentrate on the outlook\nfor the U.S. economy, which is now nearing the fourth anniversary of an economic\nrecovery that officially began in mid-2009. As I share my outlook, though, I must note\nthat the views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve Board of Governors or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n1\n\n\fEconomic Conditions\nLet me start with a discussion of inflation, since in my view, preserving price stability is\nthe most important function of a central bank. In our modern economy, monetary\npolicy has ultimate responsibility for preserving the purchasing power of a nation's fiat\ncurrency. That is not to say that central bankers have always lived up to that\nresponsibility. At times, the Federal Reserve has been successful, but at other times, it\nhas failed, such as the period of rapid deflation during the early 1930s or the rapid\ninflation of the 1970s.\nHowever, economists and central bankers have learned from the past, which has led to\nbetter results over the last 20 years. From 1972 to 1992, the average inflation rate, as\nmeasured by the personal consumption expenditure, or PCE, price index, was about 5.5\npercent, largely reflecting the Great Inflation episode of the 1970s and the subsequent\ntransition to lower inflation during the 1980s. But in the two decades since 1992,\ninflation has averaged around 2 percent per year. While these averages mask the ups\nand downs, I believe the numbers suggest that the Fed has done a better job of\nachieving its objective of stable inflation in recent decades.\nIn January 2012, the FOMC announced an explicit long-run inflation target of 2 percent a\nyear for the PCE price index. Being explicit about our inflation objective enhances the\ncredibility of our commitment to price stability, which helps anchor inflation\nexpectations and foster price stability and moderate long-term interest rates.\nIn the past three years, average PCE inflation in the U.S. has been running about 1.8\npercent. Although that is a bit below our 2 percent target, I expect inflation to remain\nclose to our goal over the next year or two. Thus, I do not see inflation as a serious\nthreat in the near term. However, I remain concerned that our extraordinary level of\nmonetary accommodation will have to be scaled back, perhaps more aggressively than\nsome think, to ensure that inflation over the medium term remains consistent with our\ntarget.\n2\n\n\fLet me turn now to other aspects of the U.S. economy, including the prospects for\ngrowth and employment. The economy grew just 1.7 percent in 2012, measured on a\nfourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis. Growth in the fourth quarter was particularly\nweak, eking out just a 0.4 percent gain, compared to 3.1 percent real GDP in the third\nquarter. However, a number of temporary factors adversely affected performance in\nthe fourth quarter, including a sharp reduction in private inventory investment, defense\nspending that declined at more than a 20 percent annual rate, and the effects of\nHurricane Sandy in the Northeast. Recent data indicate that 2013 has gotten off to a\ngood start as the effects of these temporary factors have waned.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. GDP, continues to\ngrow at a moderate pace. So far, the increase in payroll taxes this year has proven to be\nless of a constraint on spending than many economists had feared. More generally, it is\nhousehold deleveraging that has been a drag on growth over the course of the recovery.\nThe housing collapse in the U.S. destroyed a lot of the equity that families had built up\nin their homes. Thus, a huge portion of their savings vanished. With that wealth gone,\nit is only natural for consumers to want to rebuild savings, and they are doing so. I\nanticipate that the effects of deleveraging on spending will continue to wane over time\nand spending will pick up as labor market conditions improve and house prices rise.\nMy forecast is that the pace of growth in the U.S. will pick up somewhat, to about 3\npercent in 2013 and 2014 – a pace that is slightly above trend. Based on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections, my outlook for 2013 is a\nlittle higher than the central tendency of 2.3 to 2.8 percent. For 2014, I am near the\nlower end of the central tendency, which is 2.9 to 3.4 percent.\nMy forecast of 3 percent growth should allow for continued improvements in labor\nmarket conditions, including a gradual decline in the unemployment rate, similar to the\ntrend we have seen over the past two years, which was a 0.7- to 0.8-percentage point\ndecline per year. Continuing at such a pace would lead to an unemployment rate close\nto 7 percent at the end of 2013 and a rate below 6.5 percent by the end of 2014.\n3\n\n\fLet me now turn to the implications for monetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nOver the last five years, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks have taken\nextraordinary actions to support the economic recovery. The Fed has lowered its policy\nrate – the federal funds rate – to essentially zero, where it has stayed for more than four\nyears. Since the policy rate cannot go lower, the Fed has attempted to provide even\nmore accommodation through large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing.\nThese purchases have greatly expanded the size and lengthened the maturity of the\nassets on the Fed’s balance sheet.\nIn addition, the Fed has provided “forward guidance” on the future path of interest\nrates. Specifically, it has indicated that so long as the outlook for inflation over the oneto two-year horizon does not move above 2.5 percent and inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored, and so long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent, the\nCommittee expects to keep the federal funds rate at essentially zero. The Committee\nhas also indicated that it anticipates that the highly accommodative stance of monetary\npolicy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery\nstrengthens.\nCurrently, the Fed is purchasing $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities and\n$45 billion of longer-term Treasury securities each month. The Committee has indicated\nthat it anticipates it will continue to purchase these assets until there is substantial\nimprovement in labor markets in a context of price stability. The Fed is also reinvesting\nthe proceeds of maturing or prepaid mortgage-backed securities and is rolling over\nmaturing Treasury securities at auction. As a result, the Fed’s balance sheet, which\nincludes about $3.2 trillion in assets, is growing at a pace of about $85 billion a month.\nThese purchases of longer-maturity assets are intended to put downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates to encourage households and businesses to spend today\nrather than save. Whatever one’s views of the benefits, these changes in the size and\n4\n\n\fcomposition of the balance sheet pose challenges for the Fed’s eventual exit from this\nperiod of extraordinary accommodation and for the normalization of monetary policy.\nOf course, before the Fed can begin to implement any sort of exit from the massive\nvolume of accommodation it has put in place, it must stop its attempts to increase\naccommodation through its ongoing asset purchase program. I was not in favor of the\nSeptember and December decisions to further grow the balance sheet, as I believed that\nthe costs exceeded the expected benefits. Nevertheless, the Committee chose to\nestablish the current open-ended asset purchase program that would adapt to changing\neconomic conditions, with particular attention to the labor market.\nIn my view, a case can be made that we have seen sufficient improvement to begin\ntapering our asset purchase program with the objective of bringing it to an end before\nyear-end. Let’s look at some of the data.\nIn the six months through September 2012, when the decision to initiate the latest\nopen-ended asset purchase program was made, private nonfarm payrolls increased an\naverage of 129,000 per month and the unemployment rate averaged 8.1 percent. In the\nsix months beginning in October 2012 and running through March 2013, private\nnonfarm payrolls have increased on average 202,000 per month and the unemployment\nrate has averaged 7.8 percent over the same period and has now reached 7.6 percent.\nMoreover, the average duration of unemployment has fallen; the share of long-term\nunemployment has dropped; and hours worked and earnings have risen. While further\nprogress would certainly be desirable, I believe the evidence is consistent with a\nsignificantly improving labor market. Thus, it is appropriate to begin scaling back the\npace of asset purchases. I want to emphasize that ending asset purchases is not the\nstart of an exit strategy, nor would it indicate that an increase in the policy rate was\nimminent. It is a way to halt efforts to continuously expand the level of accommodation\nby increasing the size of the balance sheet. Given the improving economy, dialing back\nasset purchases is an appropriate response.\n5\n\n\fMany observers have noted that the March employment report, released last Friday,\nwas a disappointment because job growth in private payrolls was only 95,000. But I\nwould remind everyone that monthly employment numbers are highly volatile and\nfluctuate a great deal from month to month. Indeed, while the March reading was\nlower than expected, the February payroll increase was higher than expected, at\n254,000. Such swings are not unusual. Moreover, the first release is only preliminary\nand is subject to revision, and recently the revisions have tended to be upward.\nWe must be cautious as policymakers not to overweight the short-term numbers,\nespecially when they are often subject to substantial revision. Excessive focus on the\nshort term is often a recipe for long-term problems.\nIn addition to gradually eliminating our asset purchases, two other steps might be taken\nprior to raising the policy rate. First, we should seek to normalize the spread between\nthe Fed’s discount rate on overnight loans to financial institutions and the funds rate\ntarget. During the crisis, the Fed reduced the spread from 100 basis points to 25 basis\npoints to encourage borrowing at the discount window to ease financial stresses. In\nFebruary 2010, after the crisis had passed, the Fed increased the discount rate by 25\nbasis points, thereby raising the spread to 50 basis points, where it currently stands.\nThere is little reason to maintain this crisis-initiated policy, and so we could begin to\nrestore the spread to more normal, or non-crisis, levels.\nA second step that might be taken before beginning normalization is to rethink our\nreinvestment strategy. There are no longer any short-term Treasuries in the Fed’s\nportfolio. Rather than reinvesting maturing and prepaid assets into longer-term assets,\nit might be prudent to reinvest into shorter-term assets. That would provide more\nflexibility in managing our balance sheet as we move forward.\nSo let me offer some thoughts about exit.\n\n6\n\n\fReconsidering the Exit Strategy\nIn March 2011, I shared principles that I thought should guide the Fed’s eventual exit\nfrom its highly accommodative policies.1 I said at the time that an effective exit strategy\nhad to begin by determining our destination – what monetary policy operating\nframework we will use after exit – and then articulating a systematic approach to get\nthere.\nMy preference is that the Fed should seek to return to an operating framework in which\nthe federal funds rate is the primary policy instrument. However, in my preferred policy\nframework, the federal funds rate target would be set in a corridor bounded below by\nthe interest rate paid on reserves, which the Fed has been authorized to do since 2008,\nand bounded above by the primary credit rate – the rate at which banks can borrow at\nthe Fed’s discount window. 2 This corridor system is similar to the system that the Fed\nused before the crisis and is used by a number of central banks around the world.\nBut the ability to pay interest on reserves allows the FOMC to consider a different\noperating system. In particular, the Fed could use the interest rate on reserves as its\npolicy rate, rather than the funds rate, to establish a floor for market rates. This\nframework implies that the size of the Fed’s balance sheet is technically indeterminate\nand could expand to be very large without necessarily affecting the implementation of\nmonetary policy. However, I am skeptical of such an approach and prefer the corridor\nsystem, in part because it constrains the size of the balance sheet.3 A corridor system\nmakes it less likely that the Fed’s balance sheet could be used for purposes outside the\npurview of monetary policy. The fed funds rate is also more familiar to markets and\n1\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Exit,” Remarks to the Shadow Open Market Committee, March 25, 2011.\nThe Fed is permitted to pay different interest rates on required reserves and excess reserves. When the\nrates differ, the rate paid on excess reserves establishes the lower bound in the corridor system, but we\ncan ignore that complication here.\n3\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “A Credible Commitment to Normalization,” Remarks at the Conference on Capital\nMarkets in the Post-Crisis Environment, Global Interdependence Center and the Bank of Finland, Helsinki,\nFinland, June 6, 2011; and Charles I. Plosser, “Credible Commitments and Monetary Policy After the\nCrisis,” Remarks at the Swiss National Bank Monetary Policy Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September\n24, 2010.\n2\n\n7\n\n\fpolicymakers, and because it is a market rate, rather than an administered rate like the\ninterest rate paid on reserves, it offers policymakers more feedback on market\npressures when setting policy.\nTo ensure that the fed funds rate trades above the interest rate on reserves,\nnormalization will require a significant reduction in the volume of reserves in the\nbanking system, which will result in a much smaller balance sheet for the Fed. The\nextent of that reduction will depend on the amount of reserves in the system when we\nbegin to tighten policy. Currently, reserves total more than $1.8 trillion and are\ngrowing. They were only about $25 billion before the crisis.\nI also believe that normalization should include returning the composition of the Fed’s\nportfolio to mostly short-term U.S. Treasury securities, as it was prior to the crisis. This\nmeans that the Fed would have to rid itself of the agency mortgage-backed securities it\ncurrently holds on its balance sheet.\nThe framework I proposed in March 2011 is largely consistent with the exit strategy\nprinciples that the Committee adopted a few months later in June 2011. The\nCommittee also went a step further and provided some information on the sequence of\nsteps it would likely use once normalization began.\nThe Committee indicated that the exit process would likely begin by ceasing to reinvest\nsome or all of the payments of principal on the Fed’s securities holdings. At the same\ntime or sometime thereafter, the Committee would modify its forward guidance on the\npath of the fed funds rate and initiate reserve-draining operations to support future\nincreases in the policy rate.\nWhen economic conditions warrant, the next step would be to begin raising the target\nfed funds rate. The Committee’s exit strategy acknowledged that for some time during\nnormalization, adjustments to the interest rate on reserves and reserve levels will be\nused to bring the fed funds rate to its target until reserve balances have been\nsubstantially reduced.\n8\n\n\fFollowing increases in the fed funds rate and interest on reserves, the Committee would\nbegin selling its agency securities. The pace of sales would be communicated to the\npublic, and it would likely be gradual and steady, but it could be adjusted as economic\nconditions warranted.\nAn important aspect of the exit strategy is that the Fed’s holdings of mortgage-related\nsecurities would be eliminated over time and the size of the portfolio would be\nnormalized. The goal is to reduce bank reserves to the smallest levels consistent with\nthe efficient implementation of a monetary policy framework in which the fed funds\nrate is the primary policy instrument.\nA lot has changed since 2011 when the Fed adopted these exit principles. So it is\nentirely appropriate to consider whether the exit strategy needs to be modified,\nespecially in lieu of changes to the size and composition of the balance sheet.\nIn my view, the exit principles adopted by the Committee two years ago still apply. In\nparticular, we should seek to return to operating in a corridor system, where the fed\nfunds rate is the primary policy instrument. The balance sheet should shrink in size to\nenable such a system to operate. And the composition of the Fed’s balance sheet\nshould return to all Treasuries. But the specific timing and sequence of the steps\ndetailed in the exit strategy may require some adjustments in light of the larger, and still\ngrowing, size of our balance sheet.\nIf asset purchases continue at current levels, reserve balances could grow to $2.25\ntrillion or more. That may require the Fed to sell assets at a somewhat faster pace than\ncontemplated in the principles adopted in 2011. This action would heighten the risk\nthat the Fed would be selling longer-term assets at a loss, which would affect the Fed’s\nremittances to the Treasury. There might even be negative remittances. That would\nnot impair the Fed’s ability to implement monetary policy or have any direct\nmacroeconomic consequences. Yet, the situation will be noticed, especially at a time\nwhen the federal government and the public are keenly focused on the need to reduce\n9\n\n\fdeficits. This would also come at a time when the Fed is paying higher interest to banks\non their reserve balances at the Fed.\nThe complexity of shrinking the balance sheet is nuanced. It involves interactions\namong the overall size and composition of the balance sheet, the pace at which interest\nrates may have to rise, the effectiveness of interest on reserves and other reservedraining tools, and the sensitivities to the prospects of negative remittances to the U.S.\nTreasury. We are in uncharted territory in this regard and should be appropriately\ncautious in specifying too detailed a path that we may not be able to follow.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the U.S. economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, and I believe that\nthe fundamentals continue to gradually improve, thus supporting my projection of\nannual growth of around 3 percent in 2013 and 2014.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve gradually, but I believe we may see\nrates near 7 percent by the end of this year and a rate below 6.5 percent by the end of\n2014. I believe inflation expectations will be relatively stable and inflation will remain at\nmoderate levels in the near term.\nThe extraordinary policy actions taken have greatly expanded the size of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet and significantly changed the composition of its asset holdings.\nEventually, economic conditions will improve to the point at which the Fed will need to\nbegin to exit from this period of extraordinary accommodation and normalize its\nframework for monetary policy. Although there have been significant changes in\nmonetary policy and the balance sheet over the past two years, I generally subscribe to\nthe exit strategy principles adopted by the FOMC in June 2011.\nIn particular, we should return to an operating framework in which the federal funds\nrate is our policy instrument, we should shrink the size of our balance sheet to a level\n\n10\n\n\fconsistent with this framework, and we should shorten the duration and return the\ncomposition of our portfolio to all Treasuries.\nThe exact steps taken and the timing to arrive at this destination may have to be\nadjusted, given the changes in our balance sheet since June 2011. But one thing is\ncertain: A precursor to an exit must be to halt the continued expansion of the balance\nsheet. That would not necessarily indicate that increases in the policy rate were\nimminent, but it would be a step in bringing to a close efforts to increase\naccommodation. The FOMC’s forward guidance is that asset purchases will continue\nuntil the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price\nstability. Our ever-growing balance sheet entails costs and poses risks to economic\noutcomes in the longer term. Given these costs and risks, in my view, the data we have\nreceived since last September, and my outlook, are sufficient to indicate to me that it is\nappropriate to begin tapering the pace of purchases with the goal of ending them\nbefore the end of the year.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy\nEconomic Development Company and\nEconomic Development Finance Corporation of Lancaster County\nAnnual Meeting\nMarch 6, 2013\nLancaster, PA\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nI want to thank the Economic Development Company and the Economic Development\nFinance Corporation of Lancaster County for the invitation to speak to you this morning.\nIt is a pleasure to be here today. At the outset, I should note that the views I express\nhere are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors\nor my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nIn my conversations around the country, I am often asked about the Federal Reserve\nSystem. To many people, the Fed is a mysterious organization. Since the Federal\nReserve is nearing its centennial later this year, I thought I would start by providing a\nlittle background about the Fed before turning to the economic outlook.\nCongress created the Federal Reserve System with the Federal Reserve Act, signed into\nlaw on December 23, 1913. The act created 12 independent Reserve Banks, overseen\nby a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nserves the Third District, which includes Delaware, the southern half of New Jersey, and\nthe eastern two-thirds of Pennsylvania.\nThe Reserve Banks distribute currency, act as a banker’s bank, and generally perform\nthe functions of a central bank, including serving as the federal government’s fiscal\n\n1\n\n\fagent. They also provide supervisory and regulatory oversight of many banking\ninstitutions within their respective Districts.\nEach Reserve Bank has a nine-member board of directors selected in a nonpartisan way\nto represent a cross-section of banking, commercial, and community interests. Scott\nSmith, a member of your group who is the retired chairman and CEO of Fulton Financial\nCorporation, serves as one of three directors representing the banking community. Six\nother directors, all nonbankers by law, come from a wide variety of backgrounds and\nperspectives. These directors not only fulfill the traditional governance role of\noverseeing the Bank’s performance but also provide valuable insights into economic and\nfinancial conditions in the District and the nation.\nThe monetary policy arm of the Fed is the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\nThe Committee includes the seven politically appointed members of the Board of\nGovernors in Washington and five of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents: the president of\nthe New York Fed and four other presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating\nbasis. The Committee meets eight times a year to set monetary policy. It discusses\neconomic conditions and, in normal times, adjusts short-term interest rates to best\nachieve its objectives of longer-run price stability and maximum employment.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the deliberations, and contribute to the Committee's assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. Each of us prepares for the meetings by gathering\ninformation from our boards of directors and advisory councils; through conversations\nwith local and international business leaders, including events like this one today; as\nwell as briefings on economic conditions by our Research staffs. All this helps to\ncontribute to a rich and comprehensive mosaic of the national economy.\nThis decentralized structure of the Fed is one of its most important features. It has deep\nroots in our nation’s federalist structure. Independent Reserve Banks ensure that policy\nreflects the economic and geographic diversity of the nation. Americans have always\n2\n\n\fbeen skeptical of too much centralized authority. The structure of the Fed was\ndeliberately designed to preserve a diversity of views and to provide checks and\nbalances.\nIndeed, I believe the diversity of opinion around the FOMC table is one of its great\nstrengths and serves to improve the quality of our policy decision-making. As the\nfamous American journalist Walter Lippmann once said, “Where all men think alike, no\none thinks very much.”\nLet me now turn to an assessment of economic conditions. I want to start with a\ndiscussion of inflation. Preserving price stability, in my view, is the most important\nfunction of a central bank. In our modern economy, there is no other government\nagency that has the responsibility or the capability to ensure the stability of the\npurchasing power of our nation’s currency.\nI will be the first to admit that over the 100-year history of the Federal Reserve, its track\nrecord has been mixed. At times, it has been successful, and at other times, it has failed\nspectacularly. We have seen periods of deflation in the early 1920s, the Depression of\nthe early 1930s, and spiraling inflation in the 1970s. Economists and central bankers\nhave learned many lessons from these various episodes, which can be seen by looking at\nour inflation performance over the last few decades. From 1972 to 1992, the average\ninflation rate, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure, or PCE, price\nindex, was 5.5 percent, largely reflecting the Great Inflation episode of the 1970s. But\nsince 1992, inflation has averaged 2 percent per year. Of course, these averages mask\nsome ups and downs, but I believe that the Fed has done a pretty good job over the last\ntwo decades in achieving its inflation objective.\nYou may remember that early last year, the FOMC announced an explicit long-run\ninflation target of 2 percent a year. While you might argue, correctly, that 2 percent\ninflation is not truly price stability, it is widely believed because of measurement\nproblems and the risks of deflation, or falling prices, that a 2 percent average inflation\n3\n\n\ftarget is a reasonable compromise when weighing all the costs and benefits. In fact,\nmost central banks around the world have a similar target.\nAverage inflation over the last three years has been running about 1.8 percent, a little\nunder our 2 percent target. I expect that PCE inflation will remain close to our goal over\nthe next year or two. However, as they say in the investment community, “Past\nperformance does not guarantee future results.” The Fed must remain vigilant.\nInflation is a monetary phenomenon. It often evolves slowly and what sometimes\nappear to be purely temporary or transitory movements in volatile individual prices, like\noil or other commodity prices, can prove to be precursors of more sustained\nmovements in prices in general.\nNevertheless, I expect that inflation will be near our 2 percent target over the medium\nto longer term. But to achieve this outcome, the FOMC will likely need to begin\nstepping back from the extraordinary accommodation it has been applying. I will return\nto this point shortly.\nLet me turn now to other aspects of the economy, including the prospects for growth\nand employment. The link between monetary policy actions and economic growth and\nemployment is quite different from monetary policy’s link with inflation. Economists\nunderstand that in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. Yet, in the long\nrun, monetary policy cannot determine the growth of either output or employment.\nEven in the short run, the links between monetary policy and employment or output are\ntenuous at best and hard to predict.\nThe FOMC explained in its January 2012 statement of longer-terms goals and objectives\nthat factors other than monetary policy play the dominant role in determining the\nmaximum level of employment. As a result, it is not feasible or desirable for the\nmonetary authorities to specify a numerical objective for employment or\nunemployment.\n\n4\n\n\fNevertheless, I have become increasingly concerned that many people inside and\noutside our government have come to expect too much from monetary policy.\nMonetary policy is not a panacea for all our economic ills. If society pressures monetary\npolicy to over-reach its capabilities, it will surely fail and, in doing so, will undermine not\nonly the Fed’s credibility but also monetary policy’s ability to deliver on the goals that it\nis most capable of achieving. The public and central bankers should scale back their\nexpectations of the role and power of monetary policy.\nLet me talk a little about the real economy, how I see it evolving, and why I think the\nrecovery has been so tepid. The recovery officially began nearly four years ago, in June\n2009, yet real GDP growth has averaged just 2.1 percent a year since then.\nAccording to the latest estimate, the economy grew just 1.6 percent in 2012, measured\non a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis. Growth in the fourth quarter was\nparticularly weak, eking out just a 0.1 percent gain. Most economists pointed to a\nnumber of temporary factors that adversely affected performance in the fourth quarter.\nIn particular, Hurricane Sandy had an enormous impact on economic activity in the\nNortheast. We also experienced a sharp decline in inventory investment, which is likely\nto be reversed. Defense spending declined at about a 20 percent annual rate. Such a\nlarge decline is unlikely to persist. Beneath the very weak headline number, there were\nsome signs of improvement in consumption, business investments, and residential\ninvestments. Thus, there is reason to be somewhat optimistic for the coming quarters.\nI anticipate that the pace of growth will pick up somewhat, to about 3 percent in 2013\nand 2014 – a pace that is slightly above trend. My outlook is somewhat more optimistic\nthan that of some forecasters. For instance, the median forecast in the Philadelphia\nFed’s first-quarter Survey of Professional Forecasters is for the economy to grow at a 2.4\npercent pace from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013.\n\n5\n\n\fMy forecast of 3 percent growth should allow for continued improvements in labor\nmarket conditions, including a gradual decline in the unemployment rate, similar to the\nimprovements we have seen over the past two years.\nSo why has the recovery been so tepid? To understand this, we need to understand the\nnature of the shocks that have hit the economy. We now understand that we entered\nthe most recent recession over-invested in the housing and financial sectors. The\neconomic adjustments as a result of the boom and bust in housing have been painful.\nThe housing and financial sectors have both shrunk as a share of the economy, and it\nwould not be particularly wise to seek to return those sectors to their pre-crisis highs.\nWe learned the hard way that those levels were not sustainable. Thus, labor and capital\nmust be reallocated to other uses. Moreover, the labor force needs to be at least\npartially retooled to match the skills employers now demand. This adjustment takes\ntime. It is painful to be sure, but it will lead to a healthier economy in the long run.\nThe housing collapse also significantly reduced consumer spending, which accounts for\nabout 70 percent of the nation’s GDP. The sharp decline in housing values destroyed a\nlot of the equity that families had built up in their homes. Thus, a huge chunk of their\nsavings vanished. With that wealth gone, it is only natural for consumers to want to\nrebuild savings. Consequently, private savings rates have risen substantially, and\nconsumption by households has been restrained.\nI believe these adjustments cannot be significantly accelerated through traditional\ngovernment policies that seek to stimulate aggregate demand. This is especially true in\nthe case of ever more aggressive monetary policy accommodation.\nThe conventional view is that by lowering interest rates, monetary accommodation\ntends to encourage households to reduce savings and thus consume more today.\nHowever, as I’ve noted, in the current circumstances, consumers have strong incentives\nto save. They are deleveraging and trying to restore the health of their balance sheets\n\n6\n\n\fso they will be able to retire or put their children through college. They are behaving\nwisely and in a perfectly rational and prudent way in the face of the reduction in wealth.\nIn fact, low interest rates and fiscal stimulus spending that leads to larger government\nbudget deficits may be designed to stimulate aggregate demand or consumption, but\nthey could actually do the opposite. For example, low interest rates encourage\nhouseholds to save even more because the return on their savings is very small. And\nlarge budget deficits suggest to households that they are likely to face higher taxes in\nthe future, which also encourages more saving. In my view, until household balance\nsheets are restored to a level that consumers and households are comfortable with,\nconsumption will remain sluggish. Attempts to increase economic “stimulus” may not\nhelp speed up the process and may actually prolong it.\nBusinesses interpret increased savings and the modest growth in consumer spending as\nweak demand. This causes them to slow production, as well as hiring and investment.\nAnd this has made progress on employment slower than it was in recoveries from\nearlier deep recessions. For instance, in the recession that occurred in 1981-82,\nunemployment peaked at 10.8 percent. Yet, by the end of 1985, three years later, the\nrate had fallen 3.8 percentage points, to 7 percent.\nIn contrast, today’s improvement in labor markets has occurred at a relatively slow\npace. The unemployment rate peaked at 10.1 percent in October 2009, but in the three\nyears since then, the rate has fallen only about 2.2 percentage points, to 7.9 percent,\nwhere it stood in January. With the economic recovery continuing, I believe we will see\nthe unemployment rate fall at a similar pace, to near 7 percent by the end of 2013.\nManufacturing activity has also been sluggish in recent months, although not all the\nnews was bad. Regional manufacturers in the Philadelphia Fed’s latest Business Outlook\nSurvey reported slightly more positive outlooks for shipments and employment. Also,\nthe survey’s broad indicators of future activity edged higher, with manufacturers\nexpecting overall production in the first quarter to be higher than in the fourth quarter.\n7\n\n\fGlobal demand has also slowed, due in large part to the economic turmoil in Europe.\nThis slowdown has restrained world trade. U.S. exports have slackened and, with it, so\nhas our manufacturing sector.\nUncertainty is the other factor restraining hiring and investment by businesses. Many\nU.S. firms have restrained hiring and investing as businesses and consumers wait to see\nhow our own fiscal problems will be resolved.\nThere remains significant uncertainty about the choices that will be made. How much\nwill tax rates rise? How much will government spending be cut? U.S. fiscal policy is\nclearly on an unsustainable path that must be corrected. Efforts by Congress and the\nadministration at the end of last year reduced some of the near-term uncertainty over\npersonal tax rates. But the impact of the sequester, the debate over the continuing\nresolution to fund the federal government beyond this month, and the debt ceiling,\nwhich will once again become binding in the spring, all have clouded the fiscal policy\nsituation. So, the resultant uncertainty will likely be a drag on near-term growth.\nIn my view, until uncertainty has been resolved, monetary policy accommodation that\nlowers interest rates is unlikely to stimulate firms to hire and invest. Firms have the\nresources to invest and hire, but they are uncertain as to how to put those resources to\ntheir highest valued use.\nTo sum up, there are good reasons to expect that the recovery will continue but at a\nmoderate pace over the next couple of years.\nLet me now turn to some implications for monetary policy. The Fed has taken\nextraordinary steps to support an economic recovery. It has lowered its target for the\nfederal funds rate from 5.25 percent to essentially zero. Since it cannot lower the\ninterest rate below zero, it has engaged in unconventional policies to provide more\naccommodation. The Fed has purchased large quantities of longer-term assets and has\nprovided what we call “forward guidance” on the future path of interest rates as a\nmeans to lower longer-term interest rates. The Fed is purchasing $85 billion of longer\n8\n\n\fmaturity assets each month ($40 billion of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by\nthe federal housing agencies and $45 billion of longer-term Treasury securities). The\nFOMC has indicated that it anticipates that the Fed will continue to purchase these\nassets until there is substantial improvement in labor markets.\nIn addition, so long as the outlook for inflation over the one- to two-year horizon does\nnot move above 2.5 percent and inflation expectations remain well anchored, the FOMC\nexpects to keep the federal funds rate at essentially zero as long as the unemployment\nrate is above 6.5 percent. It also indicated that the highly accommodative stance of\nmonetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic\nrecovery strengthens.\nIn taking these policy actions, the FOMC is attempting to balance the expected benefits\nwith the expected costs. Yet, we are operating in an uncertain environment and using\nnontraditional policies with which we have limited experience. Given my analysis of the\nfactors that are restraining growth, I have been reluctant to support an ever more\naccommodative policy in an effort to speed the recovery. With interest rates already\nextremely low, I believe that the benefits are few and do not outweigh the potential\ncosts. Admittedly, these potential costs are difficult to quantify, but they are real\nnonetheless. The costs fall in three major areas: financial stability, market functioning,\nand price stability.\nI have heard from various business contacts that the low interest rate environment is\nspurring institutional and individual investors to “search for yield.” This may entail\ntaking on more credit risk than these investors are typically comfortable with in a reach\nfor yields that may ultimately be illusive and result in losses they are ill-equipped to\nhandle. Very low yields may also be distorting other investment decisions, inducing\nfirms to undertake long-run investment projects that may prove to be unprofitable in a\nrising interest rate environment. Of course, the intention of accommodative monetary\npolicy is to ease credit conditions so that risk-taking and investment increase. However,\n\n9\n\n\fthere can be too much of a good thing with interest rates as low for as long as they have\nbeen. We do not want monetary policy to sow the seeds of financial instability.\nFinancial instability, for example, may arise from the higher levels of interest rate risk\nthat investors, including financial institutions, are holding by funding long-term, lowyielding assets with short-term liabilities. When interest rates rise, the losses these\nfirms will face could be a source of financial instability.\nWe also do not know whether the Fed’s growing presence in the market for mortgagebacked securities will distort the functioning of this market in the longer run. But with\nthe large volume of purchases the Fed is making, this possibility needs to remain on our\nradar screen.\nI also believe that our current, increasingly accommodative monetary policy has the\npotential to complicate the Fed’s exit from the nontraditional policies and undermine its\nability to achieve long-run price stability. The Fed’s balance sheet is very large – the\nbanking system is currently holding $1.7 trillion of reserves at the Fed. As the recovery\npicks up momentum, long-term interest rates will begin to rise, and banks will begin to\nlend these excess reserves to businesses and consumers. Loan growth and economic\nactivity will pick up, and the Fed will need to withdraw accommodation – and it may\nhave to do so quickly – to restrain inflationary pressures.\nThe Fed has tools to tighten policy in such a high-reserves environment, including paying\ninterest on reserves, offering term deposits, and engaging in reverse repurchase\nagreements. Even though we have tested some of these on a small scale, there remains\nsome uncertainty about their effectiveness, since we do not have historical experience.\nShould the tools not work as well as expected, there is some risk that inflation\nexpectations may rise, putting at jeopardy the Fed’s ability to achieve its price stability\ngoal.\nSimilarly, the Fed is using forward guidance as a policy tool, but the effectiveness of this\ntool to yield better economic outcomes depends on the credibility of the Fed’s\n10\n\n\fcommitment to longer-run price stability. Allowing inflation to deliberately deviate\nfrom the central bank’s longer-term goal for too long — even if not much higher than 2\npercent, as indicated in our current forward guidance — runs the risk that inflation\nexpectations could become unanchored. If that happens, whatever credibility the\ncentral bank had previously accrued could quickly vanish. As policymakers worked to\nreestablish their reputation, inflation, employment, and output would all suffer.\nThe Fed’s recent policy choices also impose some risks to the institution itself, which\nultimately could affect the economy in general. As a result of its policies, the Fed’s\nbalance sheet has grown nearly fourfold and is much longer in duration. This means that\nwhen interest rates rise, the Fed’s remittances to the Treasury will fall. They could even\nbe negative for some years, should the Fed have to sell some of the longer maturity\nassets. Negative remittances would not impair the Fed’s ability to implement monetary\npolicy and would have no direct macroeconomic consequences. Yet, the situation will\nnot go unnoticed. This is surely true at a time when the federal government is trying to\nreduce its deficits and when the Fed is paying higher amounts to banks on the reserve\nbalances they are holding at the Fed. Would such a situation spur renewed calls to\nreduce the Fed’s independence to set monetary policy? There is a substantial body of\nresearch that shows that central bank independence results in better economic\noutcomes for both inflation and output. Thus, if Congress were to accede to such calls,\nthe outcome would have long-term negative consequences for our independence and\nthus our ability to pursue price stability.\nIn my view, these potential costs outweigh the potential benefits of continuing our\npurchases of longer-term assets at a pace of $85 billion per month. I would like the\nFOMC to begin to taper these purchases with an aim toward ending them before the\nend of the year.\n\n11\n\n\fIn summary, the U.S. economy continues to grow at a moderate pace. I expect annual\ngrowth of around 3 percent in 2013 and 2014.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve only gradually, but I believe we\nmay see rates near 7 percent by the end of this year. I believe inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and inflation will remain at moderate levels in the near term.\nI believe that with interest rates already extremely low and the Fed’s balance sheet\nlarge and growing, monetary policy is posing risks to the economy in terms of financial\nstability, market functioning, and price stability. While the potential costs are difficult to\nmeasure, they are nonetheless important factors that we need to assess in setting\npolicy. In light of what I believe are meager benefits, should economic conditions evolve\nas I currently anticipate, I believe we should begin to taper our asset purchases with an\naim of ending them before year-end. This will allow for an orderly transition to a\ngradual reversal of our highly accommodative stance of monetary policy when economic\nconditions warrant it.\n\n12\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fForward Guidance\nStanford Institute for Economic Policy Research’s (SIEPR) Associates Meeting\nStanford, CA\nFebruary 12, 2013\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nThe last five years have been an extraordinary time for central banking and monetary\ntheory. The collapse in housing values, the ensuing financial crisis, and the slow\neconomic recovery have challenged economic policymakers. To meet these challenges,\ncentral banks have pushed the limits of traditional economic theories and have\nexperimented with untested tools and novel instruments.\nIn December 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, lowered the fed\nfunds rate, its primary policy instrument, to essentially zero. Having reached this zero\nlower bound, the Fed has turned to unconventional policy tools in an attempt to provide\nfurther monetary accommodation. One of these unconventional tools has been largescale purchases of longer maturity assets, such as Treasury securities and mortgagebacked securities. These purchases – sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or\nQE – have increased the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and significantly changed its\ncomposition.\nAnother unconventional tool used by the FOMC has been “forward guidance.” Instead\nof being an overt policy action, forward guidance is communication about future policy\nactions – the likely future path of the policy rate or monetary policy more generally. In\nmy remarks today, I will discuss the rationale for using forward guidance and how it is\nintended to affect the economy. I will then turn to how the Federal Reserve has\nimplemented this tool, and I will conclude with suggestions on how we might enhance\nits effectiveness.\nOf course, my views are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve or my\ncolleagues on the FOMC.\n\n1\n\n\fForward Guidance in Theory\nAt one level, forward guidance is just another step toward increased transparency and\nimproved communication in policymaking. Viewed in this light, it can be an important\nelement of sound central banking, as I have discussed on many occasions. Appropriately\nemployed, forward guidance can help the public form more accurate expectations about\nthe future path of monetary policy and thus help promote stability in financial markets\nand the economy.\nEconomists have come to understand that expectations play an important role in the\neconomy. Expectations about future business conditions, income or wages, inflation,\nand government tax and spending policies all influence decisions made today by\nconsumers and businesses. For example, it is my view that unclear expectations, or\nuncertainty, about the future course of federal tax rates and spending plans has had a\nsignificant dampening effect on the U.S. economy over the last two years. Having a\nbetter understanding of the “rules of the game,” so to speak, would reduce uncertainty\nabout fiscal policy and allow consumers and businesses to make more informed\ndecisions.\nThe same is true of monetary policy. When the public has a better understanding of the\nanticipated path of monetary policy, households and businesses can make better\ndecisions about spending, investment, and employment.\nOver the past 20 years, the Fed has been on a journey toward increased transparency to\nhelp the public anticipate the Fed’s policy responses to economic developments. Of\ncourse, this is only feasible if policymakers’ actions are somewhat predictable. This is\none reason I and others have long advocated that policymakers follow a systematic\napproach to policy – one guided by clear and easily understood rules.\nIn normal times, such policy rules, or reaction functions, indicate how the policy\ninstrument is set in response to economic developments, such as movements in\ninflation, employment, or output. In the U.S., this could take the form of an interestrate rule, in which the Fed’s policy rate – the federal funds rate – is adjusted in response\nto economic conditions. In fact, almost all of the mainstream economic models assume\nthat policymakers behave in a rule-like manner that is well understood by the public.\nFor example, if economic activity was growing rapidly and inflation was expected to rise\nabove some goal, the rule would prescribe raising the fed funds rate. On the other\nhand, if economic activity was falling and inflation was slowing, such a rule would tell\npolicymakers to lower the fed funds rate. One of the most well-known rules of this type\nwas suggested by John Taylor, but there are many variations. All the variations describe\nhow policy is expected to vary with economic conditions. So adopting a rule can be an\neffective way of providing forward guidance, since it makes future policy actions more\npredictable.\n2\n\n\fBut in a period like today, when the rate is near zero, policymakers cannot directly lower\nthe policy rate further, even if economic conditions and the policy rule called for such a\nstep. What can a policymaker do when the interest-rate rule says to lower rates in\nresponse to economic developments, but the rate is already constrained by the zero\nlower bound on interest rates?\nIt turns out that in a number of models, when policymakers are confronted with the\nzero lower bound, it can be desirable, and in some cases optimal, for the central bank to\ncommit to keeping the policy rate lower for longer than would otherwise be prescribed\nunder its traditional policy rule. That is, it may be desirable and beneficial to offer\nforward guidance that promises to make monetary policy “too easy” well into the\nfuture. By affecting the public’s expectations about the future path of policy, this\nforward guidance can impact the current economy.\nThere are two channels through which such a commitment could work. The first\nchannel is through influencing the public’s expectations of inflation. A credible\ncommitment to keep the policy rate more accommodative than it otherwise would be\nfor some period of time in the future, before bringing inflation back to the central\nbank’s long-term objective, would tend to temporarily raise inflation expectations.\nWhen the nominal interest rate is near zero, higher inflation expectations will tend to\npush real interest rates lower. This would typically induce consumers to save less and\nspend more today, thus stimulating current consumption and aggregate demand. This\nchannel of temporarily higher inflation expectations has been stressed, for example, by\nGauti Eggertsson and Michael Woodford in their influential 2003 paper.*\nA second but related channel through which forward guidance could work is by\ninfluencing the public’s expectations about future economic prospects. A credible\ncommitment to keep the short-term policy rate lower than normal should lead the\npublic to expect a pickup in growth and higher income in the future. Since better\neconomic times are coming, households and businesses need not save as much for a\nrainy day and can increase their consumption and spending today, thus boosting current\naggregate demand. In this case, forward guidance to keep rates lower for longer can\nboost the economy in the short run, in part because the central bank is promising to\nmake things better in the longer term.\nNote, however, that the central bank’s ability to influence the public’s belief about the\nfuture path of policy and the economy depends critically on the bank’s commitment to\nthat policy path and the credibility of that commitment in the eyes of the public. The\npublic must believe that even after the economy begins to strengthen, the central bank\nwill hold rates lower than it otherwise might have found desirable to do had it not been\nat the zero bound in the past.\n*\n\nSee Gauti Eggertsson and Michael Woodford, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary\nPolicy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1 (2003), pp. 139-211.\n\n3\n\n\fThus, monetary policy can potentially affect the economy not only through its current\npolicy actions but also through the public’s expectations of future policy actions. The\ntheory is clear: If the public does not believe that the central bank will remain\ncommitted to this strategy, then current expectations will not change and the policy will\nnot deliver the economic stimulus sought. Moreover, if forward guidance subsequently\nproves to be an unreliable predictor of the policy actually adopted, it can contribute to\ninstability, result in unintended consequences, and undermine the central bank’s\ncredibility. Thus, such attempts at managing expectations through forward guidance\nshould be used with some caution.\nForward Guidance in Practice\nThe use of forward guidance is not new, but its quantitative impact is difficult to\nestablish. You may recall that the FOMC used forward guidance in August 2003 when it\nperceived that deflation was a risk. In its policy statement, the FOMC indicated that\nmonetary policy accommodation could be maintained for a “considerable period.” At\nthe time, the markets had been anticipating a faster pace of tightening, and the\nlanguage helped to align market expectations with that of policymakers. Five months\nlater, in January 2004, when the deflation risk had subsided, the FOMC changed the\nguidance and noted that it believed it could “be patient in removing its policy\naccommodation.” Then in May 2004, just four months later, the FOMC indicated that\naccommodation could “be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.” That\nmeasured pace began at the next meeting when the FOMC raised the fed funds rate by\n25 basis points and then did so at each meeting through June 2006, bringing the rate up\nfrom 1 percent to 5.25 percent.\nIn the most recent business cycle, the FOMC reintroduced forward guidance in\nDecember 2008, saying that it anticipated that economic conditions were “likely to\nwarrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.” In March\n2009, the Committee replaced “for some time” with “an extended period.” This lasted\nuntil August 2011 when the FOMC changed the “extended period” language to a\ncalendar date, specifically indicating that rates would remain low “at least through mid2013.” The Committee then amended that target date twice last year – first to “late\n2014” in January and then to “mid-2015” in September.\nIn December 2012, the FOMC moved away from forward guidance based on a calendar\ndate to forward guidance framed in terms of economic conditions. The Committee\nindicated that it anticipates that the low policy rate would be appropriate at least as\nlong as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, the outlook for inflation one\nto two years ahead remains at or below 2.5 percent, and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored. The FOMC also indicated, as it did in September,\nthat accommodative policy will “remain appropriate for a considerable time after the\neconomic recovery strengthens.”\n4\n\n\fSome of you may know that I was not a supporter of the calendar-date forward\nguidance because it didn’t convey any information about the FOMC’s reaction function.\nPolicy should depend on the evolution of the economy, not on the calendar. While the\nnew threshold formulation is a step in the right direction, it, too, does not go as far as a\npolicy rule would in providing information on policymakers’ reaction function. The\nthreshold formulation concentrates only on a particular pair of points: the 6.5 percent\nunemployment rate and the 2.5 percent inflation outlook. But it does not provide\nguidance about how the policy interest rate will evolve after the threshold is reached.\nAlso, it doesn’t help answer the question, how will policy respond to other combinations\nof inflation and unemployment? Thus, neither the calendar date nor the threshold form\nof forward guidance constitute the systematic approach to monetary policy that I\nprefer.\nPractical Challenges in the Use of Forward Guidance\nAs I have argued, forward guidance as a tool of monetary policy has gained attention\nand traction in our current economic situation because, in some models, it can help\nalleviate the constraint of the zero lower bound on the nominal policy rate. However,\njust because it works well in some models does not mean it works well in practice. In\nfact, in some scenarios, forward guidance could have the opposite effect than intended.\nIn theory, the effectiveness of forward guidance to provide accommodation at the zero\nbound depends on the central bank’s ability to make a commitment and the credibility\nof that commitment in the eyes of the public. There are reasons to be skeptical about\nboth points. First, forward guidance requires the central bank to commit future\npolicymakers to follow a course that may stretch far into the future. Yet, policymakers\noften prefer discretion over commitment or rules, arguing that they must be able to\nrespond “appropriately” to economic shocks as they arise. Thus, there is an inevitable\ntension between the desire for discretion and the desire to commit to a policy path.\nSecond, optimal forward guidance requires policymakers to commit to making policy in\na way that is different from what policymakers would want to do when the time comes.\nEconomists would say that policymakers are trying to commit to a policy that is not\ntime-consistent. Put another way, former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin\nused to say that monetary policy’s job “is to take away the punch bowl just when the\nparty is getting good.” Yet, these models tell us that at the zero lower bound, forward\nguidance should convey the opposite. That is, it should promise that monetary policy\nwill not remove the punch bowl but allow the party to continue until very late in the\nevening to ensure that everyone has a good time. But what will make the public believe\nthat policymakers in the future will deviate from past practices in this way? And will\npolicymakers or the public be willing to tolerate the future inflation when it comes and\nbelieve that it is only temporary?\n5\n\n\fOf course, in the theoretical economic models, this time inconsistency is not an issue\nbecause the models assume that policymakers are fully committed to the preannounced policy path and that the public believes policymakers will follow through\nwith their stated intentions. That is, there is no option to deviate from the announced\npath.\nBut in practice, credibility is imperfect and some might say fragile. If the public doubts\nthat policymakers will follow the pre-announced policy path, then forward guidance will\nnot have the desired effects and it may even have counterproductive consequences.\nNot only must there be a credible commitment to the policy but the public must fully\nunderstand the message policymakers are sending in the guidance. This can be a tricky\ncommunications problem.\nIn normal times, a central bank tends to earn a reputation through its actions. Of\ncourse, I would prefer that monetary policymakers be more transparent and adopt a\nsystematic policy rule as a guide to policy. However, even if policymakers choose not to\nbe so explicit, the actions a central bank takes over time can enhance the public’s\nunderstanding of how the institution is likely to set policy. This helps make the central\nbank’s policy choices at least somewhat predictable. Even if the central bank doesn’t\nnecessarily tell the public how it will behave through a policy rule, the public learns how\nit does, in fact, behave by its actions.\nIt is easy to think of examples. The German Bundesbank earned a reputation for\nkeeping inflation low over many decades following episodes of hyperinflation. The\nSwiss National Bank similarly earned a reputation for low inflation over many decades.\nThe Fed earned its reputation for price stability over three decades following the high\ninflation of the 1970s. Such reputations are hard won but can be easily lost. Following\nnearly two decades of low inflation in the 1950s and early 1960s, the Fed lost its\nreputation in the late 60s and early 70s, resulting in double-digit inflation. The cost of\nrestoring that reputation was the wrenching recession of the early 1980s.\nThe models that advocate forward guidance as a policy tool at the zero bound assume\nthat the public fully understands the policy rule that the central bank had been\nfollowing, will understand when a new policy path is announced, and will believe that\nthe central bank is fully committed to implementing that new policy.\nBut managing the public’s expectations of monetary policy is a difficult task, especially\nwhen the policy is far from what the central bank has implemented in the past. This\nopens the door for the public to misunderstand the message the central bank is sending.\nFor example, when a central bank says it wants to keep rates low for a very long time,\nthe public might interpret this as a statement that the central bank thinks the economic\noutlook is very poor, rather than the message the central bank wants to send, namely,\n6\n\n\fthat policymakers will ensure that the economy improves by keeping policy more\naccommodative than normal. Such a misunderstanding, of course, would undermine\nthe channels through which such a commitment to low rates is supposed to work.\nRather than encouraging the public to bring spending forward and reduce current\nsaving, this misinterpretation could encourage more saving today to prepare for what\nthe public believes are hard times to come. Thus, rather than alleviating the problems\nof the zero bound, the forward guidance may exacerbate these problems, leaving the\neconomy trapped at the zero bound and caught in a Japanese-style lost decade of\nmodest deflation and low growth. Indeed, some have argued that when the Fed first\nintroduced calendar-date forward guidance, the public interpreted the step as signaling\nthat the FOMC’s economic outlook had worsened.\nSimilarly, forward guidance may risk unanchoring longer-term inflation expectations.\nOne channel through which forward guidance works is by temporarily raising inflation\nexpectations. But this must be done without undermining the credibility of the central\nbank’s commitment to longer-term price stability. In our theoretical economic models,\nthis is easily accomplished because the central bank is assumed to have perfect\ncredibility, so this risk is not present. However, in practice, with imperfect credibility,\nallowing inflation to deliberately deviate from the central bank’s longer-term goal runs\nthe risk that inflation expectations will become unanchored. If that happens, whatever\ncredibility the central bank had previously accrued could quickly vanish. As\npolicymakers worked to reestablish their reputation, inflation, employment, and output\nwould all suffer. I note that the FOMC’s threshold forward guidance may help partially\nmitigate the risk of destabilizing inflation expectations. But it is only partial insurance,\nsince the inflation threshold is formulated in terms of the central bank’s outlook for\ninflation, which may be slow to deviate from the central bank’s target until inflation and\ninflation expectations have already moved higher.\nThus, while our models suggest that forward guidance is a useful policy tool, we must\nremain humble about its expected benefits in the real world of imperfect commitment,\nimperfect credibility, and difficult-to-manage expectations.\nExpectations are important, but in my view, policymakers have only a limited ability to\nmanage those expectations. We have to understand those limitations. I believe the\nbest course is to be clearer about what our reaction function will be to changes in key\neconomic variables. I also believe we need to let the public know that monetary policy\ncan’t control or mitigate every shock to our economy. What it can, and should, do is to\nreact to economic conditions in a systematic and predictable manner.\nCan We Improve Our Current Forward Guidance?\nIn that context, we should ask ourselves whether there are better ways to express\nforward guidance. I believe that we could make our forward guidance more effective\n7\n\n\fand improve policymaking more generally if we were more explicit about our policy\nreaction function in normal times. Why would this help?\nAs I discussed earlier, the Fed’s current forward guidance is formulated in terms of\nthresholds for unemployment and inflation. But these are thresholds, not triggers. The\nFOMC has not made a commitment to act once a threshold is reached, nor has it\nindicated how policy will evolve after a threshold is reached. Instead, the FOMC has\nindicated that it expects to keep the stance of policy highly accommodative for a\nconsiderable time after the economic recovery strengthens. While this gives some\nindication that the Committee does not expect to tighten policy quickly after the\nthresholds are reached, the Committee is silent on how policy will actually be\nconducted.\nThis vagueness runs counter to the theory that supports the use of this explicit form of\nforward guidance in the first place. In order for forward guidance to be effective at the\nzero bound, the public must understand how the central bank intends to conduct policy\nin the future and also that this conduct differs from the typical way policy is set. This\nrequired understanding underscores the usefulness of systematic policymaking not only\nat the zero bound but also in normal times. The public must have a good understanding\nof how we conduct policy more generally – our traditional monetary policy reaction\nfunction – in order to understand the difference implied by our forward guidance at the\nzero bound. The more clearly we can articulate a reaction function that serves us well\nin normal times, the more effective will be our forward guidance efforts at the zero\nbound and, for that matter, at other times when deviations from normal policy might be\ncalled for. Thus, I have long been an advocate of systematic policymaking and increased\ntransparency – in good times and in bad times.\nAlthough my FOMC colleagues are not ready to choose a particular policy rule or\nreaction function to govern policy, we continue to explore the efficacy of monetary\npolicy rules as guides to policy, as indicated in the minutes of the July 31-August 1, 2012\nFOMC meeting. I believe we should continue to identify simple rules that work across a\nvariety of economic models and try to communicate more information about the Fed’s\npolicy reaction function. We could improve policy transparency and communications by\nidentifying the key economic variables on which we base our policy decisions and then\nframe the rationale for any change in policy around changes in these key variables. If\nthe Fed is systematic about how it sets policy in normal times, the public will form more\naccurate judgments about the likely course of policy. This will not only improve the\nefficacy of monetary policy in normal times by reducing uncertainty and promoting\nstability, it will also increase the efficacy of forward guidance in extraordinary times, like\nthe ones we find ourselves in today.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fSome Observations About Policy Lessons from the Crisis\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum\nPolicy Lessons from the Economic and Financial Crisis\nDecember 4, 2009\n\nWelcome\nThank you all for joining us today for the Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum. It has been\ntwo years since our last gathering in Philadelphia, and a lot has transpired since then. We\nhave experienced one of the deepest and most severe recessions in the post-World War II\nera, accompanied by a financial crisis that has challenged financial institutions,\npolicymakers, and, most of all, businesses and consumers. During the last two years, the\nFederal Reserve has taken unprecedented actions in its role as lender of last resort as well\nas in monetary policy to mitigate the effects of this crisis and support a return to\neconomic growth. The Congress and the Treasury have also taken extraordinary\nmeasures in fiscal policy and in their interventions into private markets.\nWe gather today as signs point to a recovering economy and an improving financial\nsector. Still, many challenges lie ahead, including making sure that we lower the odds of\na future crisis while ensuring that we are better prepared to handle one when it arises.\nToday’s agenda is intended to contribute to a thoughtful, objective discussion of some\npolicy lessons we might draw from this crisis. Do we understand the key elements that\ngave rise to the crisis? Do we understand how the monetary and fiscal policy actions we\ntook affected outcomes – either positively or negatively? Do we understand how the\nregulatory environment and our supervisory practices should be changed to help us avoid\nanother crisis?\nBefore going any further, I want to thank Loretta Mester and other members of the\nResearch Department, in particular, Mike Dotsey and Mitchell Berlin, for making this\nevent possible. Through their efforts, we have assembled an extraordinary collection of\nspeakers. Loretta has done her part while also on loan to the Division of Monetary\nAffairs at the Board of Governors for the last four months, and we are glad to have her\nback in time for today’s event.\n\n1\n\n\fRegulatory Reform under Uncertainty\nAs the host for today’s program, I am going to take the opportunity to share some of my\nown thoughts on important lessons arising from the crisis. But I begin with a caveat: I\nbelieve that it is important to be modest about what we actually know and realistic about\nwhat we can actually achieve. The race to reform will not serve the nation well if haste\nmakes for faulty or misguided policies.\nI believe that it is too soon to say with any confidence that we fully understand the\ncurrent crisis. We are still in the learning phase, positing a wide range of hypotheses\nabout the role of market failures as well as regulatory failures, and formulating some\nrough estimates of the relative weights to place on various contributing factors. I think it\nwill take more forums like this one and more careful and dispassionate analysis before we\nfully understand what happened and why.\nMy own view is that in the face of so much uncertainty, we should move more\ndeliberately in designing major regulatory reforms, certainly more deliberately than the\ncurrent legislative calendar suggests. Making major policy reform based on anecdotes\nand narratives that have not yet met the test of more rigorous analysis is misguided.\nRushing major policy reforms in the immediate aftermath of a crisis risks adopting\npolicies that have unintended consequences.\nWe also need to be realistic about what we can achieve with regulatory reform. We\nshould not assume that regulators have some crystal ball and thus can see the future with\nmore clarity than market participants. We also should not assume that markets will stand\nstill, nor should we want them to.\nOf course, like everyone here, I have my own candidates for lessons learned. They are\nfairly high-level lessons that I think will be important as we move forward with\nregulatory reform. As we consider regulatory reform, I think it is important that we look\nbeyond market failures and also consider policy failures. With that in mind, I’d like to\nspend a few minutes on two lessons that I have taken away from the crisis, neither of\nwhich is novel or unique to me. They certainly are not the only two lessons one can take\naway, and we will hear more about these two and many other lessons as we listen to our\nexperts today.\nThe first lesson I would like to highlight is that moral hazard and the too-big-to-fail\nproblem loom large and have contributed to the crisis in fundamental ways. If reforms do\nnot adequately address these problems, then reform efforts will be a failure. The second\nlesson is that regulators are not perfect, and using regulations that excessively stifle the\nmarkets will also fail, because private interests will always seek to escape regulation.\nThus, for reform to improve financial stability, it must rely heavily on making market\ndiscipline more effective and not simply rely on government rules and regulations. So let\nme talk briefly about each of these lessons and what I have learned from them.\n\n2\n\n\fMoral Hazard and Too-Big-To-Fail\nFor me, a major lesson of this financial crisis is how easy it is for discretionary policy\nchoices to exacerbate moral hazard and the problem of firms deemed too big to fail. In\nmy view, policy actions — before and during this crisis — vastly expanded the safety net\nfor financial institutions.\nFor example, we had a major moral hazard problem on our hands long before the crisis\narose, one that became a major contributing factor to the severity of the crisis. The\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs — and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in\nparticular — were rife with long-standing moral hazard problems. Despite warnings\nfrom many economists and many Federal Reserve officials, these entities were allowed to\noperate for private profit but with essentially a government debt guarantee. There is no\nmore classic example of moral hazard than this arrangement. Fannie and Freddie had the\nincentive to take extraordinary risks at taxpayer expense. As we know, these GSEs were\nplaced in conservatorship by the Treasury and they have already received almost $111\nbillion in taxpayers’ funds. My own guess is that the taxpayer costs of rescuing Fannie\nand Freddie will easily exceed that of any other financial institution that has received\ntaxpayer support from either the Fed or the Treasury. Yet, neither of the two major\nproposals in Congress has dealt with the flawed structure of these institutions nor with the\nfailure of government oversight.\nUnfortunately, rather than limiting moral hazard and the too-big-to-fail problem, we have\nmade them worse during the crisis. In trying to stabilize the financial system, we have\nled creditors of large financial institutions to expect that the government will protect them\nfrom losses, which in turn means they need not monitor risk-taking by these firms.\nPrior to the decision to bail out Bear Stearns’ creditors, few market participants would\nhave put a small firm like Bear Stearns on a list that regulators would consider too big to\nfail. Here’s a case where size isn’t everything. Complexity, interconnectedness, and the\nability to generate spillovers to other financial firms can all raise the stakes when failure\nlooms. During this crisis and through the implementation of the stress tests, we have\neffectively declared at least 19 financial institutions as too big to fail — many of which\nwould not previously have been considered a systemic threat. The bailouts of GM,\nChrysler, Fannie, and Freddie have further reinforced the message that government will\nprovide taxpayer support to large financial and, in some cases, nonfinancial firms.\nNot only does the too-big-to-fail badge generate moral hazard at these institutions, it also\ncreates powerful incentives for other institutions to become large and complex and take\nrisks at taxpayers’ expense. In my view, this situation is untenable and must be reversed.\nNo firm ought to be too big to fail.\nIf there is any doubt that the presence or absence of moral hazard can change the\nbehavior of firms, consider the reaction of a number of firms when Lehman was allowed\nto fail. The failure of Lehman signaled that the government may not choose to rescue all\ncreditors of the largest financial institutions. That realization, in part, led the remaining\n\n3\n\n\fmajor investment banks to make significant changes: Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of\nAmerica, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley sought bank holding company\nstatus, subjecting themselves to higher capital ratios and more supervision. One can’t\nhelp but wonder what Lehman and other firms might have done differently had Bear\nStearns’ creditors not been rescued.\nI want to emphasize that the policy responses — from the rescue of Bear Stearns, to the\nfailure of Lehman, and to the bailout of AIG — have aggravated the too-big-to fail\nproblem.\nIn the case of these nonbank financial institutions, we faced added challenges because we\nwere extremely limited in our ability to permit failure in an orderly manner. The lack of\nan acceptable mechanism to fail these large interconnected financial firms clearly put\npolicymakers between a rock and a hard place — either run the risk of creating\npotentially large, unknown risks to financial and macroeconomic stability or take the\nunpalatable step of increasing moral hazard. The Fed chose the latter, but we must now\nface the consequences of these actions and develop a better regime to rein in the moral\nhazard created. Doing so requires that policymakers articulate a transparent, consistent,\nand predictable policy regarding bailouts, and, perhaps a more difficult task,\npolicymakers must commit to follow the policy. Indeed, the regulatory regime must be\ndesigned with built-in commitment mechanisms that make it difficult for policymakers\nnot to implement the policy. Failing to develop such a new regime will risk sowing the\nseeds for the next crisis and ever more frequent, and perhaps costly, taxpayer bailouts.\nThe Need for a Resolution Mechanism\nOne essential piece of a new policy that helps rein in moral hazard and manage the toobig-to-fail problem is the development of a mechanism for safely allowing the failure of\nlarge and interconnected financial firms.\nAs I said, no firm should be too big to fail. A resolution mechanism would encourage\ngreater market discipline on the decisions made by systemically important firms. But we\nneed to think carefully about the various options for resolution. If Congress merely\nexpands the safety net by enlarging the list of firms that have access to government\nresources or increases the opportunities for the government to take over firms, we will\nhave failed to solve the problem. In my mind, a resolution mechanism is a bankruptcy\nmechanism. That is, shareholders are wiped out, unsecured creditors face losses, and the\nfirm is either liquidated or sold to other private parties rather than becoming a ward of the\nstate.\nDuring the recent financial crisis, shareholders of failed banks have lost their\ninvestments, but only some bondholders have suffered any losses. Furthermore, the\nshareholders of the largest financial institutions on government assistance have been\ndiluted, but they haven’t lost their investments. And bondholders and other creditors at\nthese institutions haven’t suffered losses at all.\n\n4\n\n\fIf the resolution authority won’t wipe out shareholders and force creditors to bear losses,\nthen it inevitably undermines market discipline and promotes moral hazard. This is\nhardly a new idea. It is, in fact, the guiding philosophy of FDICIA (the FDIC\nImprovement Act of 1991).\nOne option would be to change the bankruptcy law to take into account the special needs\nof financial institutions, or to create a specialized bankruptcy court to handle financial\nfirms. This might be a more credible way of permitting systemically important financial\nfirms to fail than current proposals to create an expanded resolution authority on the\nmodel of the FDIC’s existing authority to operate bridge banks. Of course, this type of\nsolution also raises questions. How will bank regulators interact with the court? How\nwill the court maintain its expertise, given that financial crises are infrequent? Who\nassigns firms to this special court?\nWe might also more broadly apply the principles of FDICIA’s prompt corrective action.\nFDICIA and prompt corrective action attempt to tie the hands of regulators to limit\ndiscretion — and the risk of forbearance — and thus try to ensure that failing banks\nactually fail or are dismantled. The guiding idea of prompt corrective action is that\nsupervisors are required to take specific actions against a bank as its capital level falls\nbelow an adequate level well above insolvency. Prompt corrective action could be\nenhanced by including other actions to try to limit any systemic fallout from a poorly\nperforming institution. For example, at a stage well before insolvency, regulators could\nconsider requiring the institution to sell off parts of the firm, insulating systemically\nimportant parts of the firm, and requiring the firm to adopt a simpler internal structure.\nBut another lesson of the recent crisis is that the passage from “well-capitalized” to\n“undercapitalized” can happen in a heartbeat — making the “prompt” in prompt\ncorrective action difficult to achieve. So, regulatory reform must enhance market\ndiscipline and regulators’ use of market signals to guide interventions.\nMarket Discipline and Regulation\nThe financial crisis has certainly underscored the need to reconsider our financial\nregulatory structure. Some have suggested the lesson of this crisis is that detailed\nregulatory rules must supplant markets. I disagree. In my view, a major lesson of the\nrecent crisis is that our regulations did too little to promote market discipline and in some\ncases actually discouraged market discipline. For example, in the case of Fannie and\nFreddie, their flawed structure and insufficient regulatory oversight actually undermined\nmarket discipline.\nThe case for greater use of market discipline and market signals as regulatory tools is a\npowerful one. Financial markets are dynamic, forward looking, and innovative, and\ndespite the events of the past two years, they remain one of the great strengths of our\neconomy. But the dynamism of our financial markets also places a serious constraint on\nfeasible regulatory reforms. Markets will inevitably seek to evade excessively costly or\n5\n\n\fpoorly drawn regulations by innovating around them. (As Nobel Laureate Merton Miller\nsaid, taxes and regulation are two of the three primary sources of financial innovation.)\nEven with the best of intentions, regulators will be behind the curve, especially when\nmarket participants are looking for ways to evade regulations. If regulators don’t harness\nmarket forces in an intelligent way, regulatory reform will surely fail.\nOne example of using market forces to strengthen financial regulation is the use of\nmandatory convertible debt, variations of which have been proposed by a number of\nacademics, including Doug Diamond, who is here today. The common element in their\nproposals is that large financial firms would be required to maintain an additional layer of\ndebt that would convert into equity in periods of stress. This provides a type of\nprepackaged recapitalization.\nContingent capital would be a lower cost alternative to simply requiring institutions to\nhold more capital; thus it would reduce incentives for financial firms to seek ways to\nevade the regulatory requirement. In addition, the market price of the debt would provide\nregulators with information about the financial health of the firm and about market\nperceptions of systemic risk. The various proposals differ in what would trigger\nconversion. But, in general, the threat of conversion would mobilize creditor discipline,\nand actual conversion of the debt would lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of the firm. In\nthis way, market discipline and regulatory discipline would complement each other, and\ninformation generated by market participants would play a central role in strengthening\nthe application of prompt corrective action.\nConclusion\nThese are a few of the lessons I have taken away from the financial crisis. There are\nothers here today with different perspectives, and I look forward to hearing the views of\nour distinguished panelists and all of you as well.\nWe are slowly emerging from the crisis, yet we are emerging to uncertain times. The\nrush to reform is palpable. Yet, we must take time to share perspectives, so that we gain\nenough understanding to make meaningful reform. That is the only way we can adopt\npolicy remedies and future policy actions that will address the right issues.\nThoughtful action that results in a sounder financial system will be the test of whether we\nhave truly learned the lessons of this crisis.\nI look forward to your help in shaping that understanding. Again, welcome to the Policy\nForum.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Plosser, President and Chief Executive Officer,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n31st Annual Economic Seminar\nSponsored by the Simon Graduate School of Business, Rochester Business Alliance,\nand JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nRochester, NY\nDecember 1, 2009\nIntroduction\nI am pleased to return to Rochester and see so many familiar faces and old friends here at\nthis 31st Annual Economic Outlook Seminar. I lived here for more than 25 years before\nmoving south to Philadelphia three years ago. Yet, when I return for these visits, I am\nreminded of Rochester’s charm, hospitality and, of course, its winters.\nAs many of you know, I grew up in Alabama and it was not until I went to graduate\nschool in Chicago that I came to appreciate the extent to which the North could offer\nthree things in great supply: cold, snow, ... and, of course, hockey!\nThis realization was driven home to me here in Rochester. As my children were growing\nup, I found that there was a way to combine all three of these things into one event —\n“early morning hockey practice.” Driving through the cold and snow to a 6:00 a.m.\nhockey practice at Lake Shore was always an exhilarating way to start the morning. Yet,\nas I learned more about the game of hockey, I found that hockey players could teach us\nthings that are relevant and useful in other disciplines, including, believe it or not,\nmonetary policy.\nHockey great Wayne Gretzky was once asked about his success on the ice. He responded\nby saying, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.” He didn’t\nchase the puck. Instead, Gretzky wanted his hockey stick to be where the puck would be\ngoing next. He scored many goals with that strategy, and I believe monetary\npolicymakers can better achieve their goals, too, if they follow the Gretzky strategy.\nGood monetary policymakers, like good hockey players, must be forward-looking in their\nactions. Setting policy that is appropriate for where the economy is today, or has recently\nbeen, is not likely to deliver the kind of economic outcomes we desire. Anticipating\nwhere the economy is headed is important because monetary policy actions affect the\neconomy with long and variable lags. The major impact of policy often comes only after\nseveral quarters, or sometimes several years.\n\n\f2\nOf course the state and evolution of the economy as we see it today is relevant for\nshaping the outlook for the future. So policymakers are always revising their outlook as\nthe data and the economy evolve. This is why you frequently hear policymakers say that\nfuture policy decisions are data-dependent.\nGretzky, like all great hockey players, excelled, in part, because of his ability to\nanticipate. That does not mean he always anticipated accurately. Sometimes his forecast\nturned out to be wrong and the puck went in another direction. But that does not mean\nthat his strategy was wrong, only that his execution needed improvement. The more you\nunderstand the game or the economy, the better your forecasts will be. Monetary\npolicymakers similarly must be forward-looking despite the difficulties, uncertainties,\nand challenges that entails.\nSo let me explain how I see the outlook for the economy and inflation as well as some of\nthe uncertainties that are influencing our policy choices.\nThe Outlook for Growth and Employment\nA year ago I told you that “Growth in the first half of 2009 is likely to be weak, with\nimprovement in the second half of the year.” That statement certainly reflects the pattern\nof growth we have seen this year, although I must admit that the very sharp decline in\nreal GDP in the first quarter of this year was larger than I expected. As a result, growth\nfor the year will be lower than what I projected a year ago. Nevertheless, growth\ndeclined only slightly in the second quarter, increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the\nthird quarter, and is continuing to grow at a similar pace in the fourth quarter. I believe\nthe economy is now in a recovery, and I have become more confident that it will be a\nsustainable recovery even as the fiscal and monetary stimulus programs begin to wind\ndown.\nThe long decline in housing activity appears to have bottomed out, as home sales and\nhousing starts have come off the lows they reached earlier this year. Home prices appear\nto have stabilized during the past few months and have even started to rise in some areas.\nThe commercial real estate market, however, has not turned the corner and poses some\nrisk to small- and medium-sized banks whose portfolios are heavily concentrated in this\nsector. Nevertheless, my view is that these risks will lessen as the economy recovers.\nA number of indicators of manufacturing and industrial activity have become more\npositive in recent months. Industrial production has now increased for several months in\na row. The Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of manufacturing activity\nreturned to positive territory in August and has continued to be positive since then. Other\nmanufacturing surveys have also been signaling that manufacturing activity is beginning\nto expand.\nThe strength of consumer spending, however, is harder to judge. In part, that is because\nauto sales were pulled forward into the summer months by the “cash-for-clunkers”\n\n\f3\nprogram. Moreover, this rebate program likely diverted some spending toward\nautomobiles and away from other goods and services that households may have been\nplanning to buy. So, it remains unclear exactly how much the cash-for-clunkers program\nactually stimulated total spending, as some claim, or whether it just redistributed it.\nThus, determining the underlying trend in consumer spending is difficult.\nOf course, the most important factor for consumer spending is the growth of personal\nincome, which on balance has been quite flat since early this year. I am not expecting\nvery strong growth in consumer spending in the coming quarters, since unemployment\nwill remain high for some time, which will restrain income growth. Even so, recent\nmonthly data have shown some increases in consumer spending outside of autos and\ngasoline, which is encouraging.\nLooking ahead to next year, I expect real GDP growth from the fourth quarter of this year\nto the fourth quarter of 2010 to be about 3 percent. I expect similar real GDP growth in\n2011. These rates of growth are more modest than what some forecasters anticipate, but\nthey are slightly above what I believe is the underlying trend growth of the economy of\nabout 2 ¾ percent.\nThis time last year the Survey of Professional Forecasters predicted the unemployment\nrate in the fourth quarter of 2009 would reach 7.7 percent. That turned out to be overly\noptimistic as we now know. The current rate is now over 10 percent. I anticipate that the\nunemployment rate may edge slightly higher before beginning a gradual decline.\nKeep in mind that changes in the unemployment rate and employment growth typically\nlag output growth, so even with better real GDP growth over the next few quarters, the\nunemployment rate and payroll employment will take a little more time to show much\nimprovement. So far, the most encouraging sign from the labor market is that job losses\nin recent months have been smaller than earlier in the year and continue to trend down.\nNevertheless, I am optimistic that payroll employment will start to rise during 2010 and\nthe unemployment rate will fall by the end of next year. Yet, the recovery of jobs from\nthis very severe recession will take time. It is likely to take a couple of years before we\nsee the unemployment rate back to more acceptable levels.\nOne contributing factor to the better outlook is the steady improvement in financial\nconditions. The recovery of financial markets from this crisis, however, is not complete\nand more time will have to pass before we can be fully confident in the health of the\nfinancial sector. Indeed, we probably will not be able to determine how well the financial\nsystem has healed until the Federal Reserve withdraws the extraordinary amount of\nsupport it has provided. By design, many of the liquidity facilities were priced so that\nthey would be less attractive as markets improved. So I have been encouraged as banks\nand other borrowers have relied less on the Fed’s lending facilities and have relied more\non financial market funding over the last six months or so.\nUncertainty still looms large. Large fiscal deficits and the prospects for significantly\nhigher taxes to fund new programs have made many businesses reluctant to undertake\n\n\f4\nnew investments or to rehire workers. This may not diminish until greater clarity is\noffered by Congress and the administration about the prospective path of fiscal policy.\nThis policy uncertainty could contribute to a weaker than otherwise recovery and its\nresolution may affect longer term prospects for the economy.\nThe Outlook for Inflation\nThe outlook for a strengthening economy is gaining focus, yet the outlook for inflation is\nbecoming more uncertain. At the beginning of this year there were growing concerns\nthat falling prices, not rising prices, were the more serious risk. Headline CPI, after all,\nfell at an 8 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 and at about a 2.5 percent\nannual rate in the first quarter of 2009.\nOn the surface, these were extraordinary numbers. But in my view, they largely reflected\nthe reversal of the dramatic rise in oil prices from late 2007 and the first half of 2008. Oil\nprices went from about $70 a barrel in mid-2007 to more than $130 by mid-2008 and\nthen back down to about $40 in January 2009. Since then, oil prices have risen again, but\nhave been fluctuating between $60 and $80 since the spring. The stabilization in oil\nprices led to the end of the deflation seen in the first quarter. For the second and third\nquarters of this year headline CPI inflation averaged about 2.5 percent at an annual rate\n— a vast difference from the over 5 percent deflation of the previous two quarters. What\nwe call core CPI, or CPI excluding food and energy, exhibited a similar but, as you\nwould expect, a less dramatic pattern. Core CPI inflation averaged just 1 percent over the\nlast quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, but in the second and third quarters of\nthis year, core CPI inflation averaged about 2 percent. On a year-over-year basis, it\nseems to be settling in at around 1.5 percent.\nMy interpretation of this pattern is that market fears of deflation were probably\nexaggerated in early 2009, being driven substantially by falling oil and commodity prices.\nAny risk of a sustained deflationary episode has now greatly subsided. This\ninterpretation is consistent with various consumer and market measures of expected\ninflation, which fell noticeably in the early part of the year, but have risen since then.\nContributing to these subsiding fears is the fact that monetary policymakers made it clear\nthat we would not permit deflation to take root.\nSo, we should all be pleased that the near-term prospects for either deflation or inflation\nseem mostly benign. Unfortunately, the prospects for inflation over the next two to five\nyears are much more uncertain, in my view, and apparently in the view of the market as\nwell.\nUltimately, inflation is a monetary phenomenon and there is no question that current\nmonetary policy is extraordinarily accommodative. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee has maintained the federal funds rate near zero for just about a year now and\nthe Fed has more than doubled its balance sheet in the process. Without appropriate steps\nto withdraw or restrict the massive amount of liquidity that we have made available to the\neconomy, the inflation rate is likely to rise to levels that most would consider\n\n\f5\nunacceptable. The great challenge facing the Fed is getting those “appropriate steps”\nright.\nThe task is made more difficult, in part, by competing views of the economic forecast and\nthe underlying structure of the economy driving that forecast. One commonly held view\nis that the economy is very weak now and, more important, that during the economic\nrecovery, high rates of unemployment and very low rates of resource utilization will\nprevent inflationary pressures from arising for quite some time, perhaps years. This\nperspective suggests there is no danger that excess liquidity will generate inflation in the\nforeseeable future. According to this view, the Fed need not worry about withdrawing\nthe liquidity or raising rates anytime soon because the inflation forecast will remain quite\ntame.\nAn alternative view shared by many others is that the just-described conventional wisdom\nmisses the mark and without a more deliberate policy of reducing liquidity and raising\ninterest rates sooner rather than later, we could very well see inflation become a serious\nconcern. In this view, inflationary expectations play an important role in the dynamics of\ninflation. It is the Fed’s credibility to keep inflation low and stable that is key to\nanchoring those expectations. So, the Fed must act in a way that assures the markets and\nthe public that it will take the necessary steps to keep inflation low and stable. If it does\nnot do this, expectations can become unanchored and inflation will rise regardless of the\namount of unemployment in the economy.\nThis view is consistent with both theoretical and empirical evidence that finds that\neconomic slack or low resource utilization is not a very reliable predictor of inflation. 1\nMoreover, several empirical studies have shown that economic slack is difficult to\nmeasure with any accuracy. 2 So making policy decisions based on measures of such\nslack and particularly on forecasts of slack many quarters ahead becomes problematic.\nIndeed, the failure to act in a way that keeps expectations of inflation anchored can easily\ntrump economic slack in determining the path of inflation. Recall that some of the\nhighest inflation rates this country has seen in the post-World War II era occurred in the\nlate 1970s when we had high rates of unemployment and low resource utilization.\nSo what’s the bottom line? While policymakers may have different outlooks for the\neconomy and inflation over the next couple of years, our objectives are the same.

Failing to anticipate in hockey means that you always end up chasing the puck\nand never catching it. Since monetary policy works with a lag, policymakers must also\nanticipate and be forward-looking in their actions. Failing to do so would mean that\npolicy would always be behind the curve — playing catch-up so to speak. The result\nwould be greater instability in the economy and a failure to achieve our policy objectives.\nAs I said, my projection is for an economic recovery with growth around 3 percent for\nthe next two years. Stronger economic growth means stronger demand for credit, which\nin turn means upward pressure on real or inflation-adjusted interest rates. When\neconomic growth is higher, the levels of market real interest rates should rise — at least\nassuming that the central bank doesn’t try to keep them from rising by pumping even\nmore liquidity into the economy. Of course, higher growth today combined with\nbusinesses and consumers that are forward-looking produces higher levels of output in\nthe future.\nIn my view, the higher levels of resource utilization in the future signaled by today’s\ngrowth implies that real interest rates will rise, which calls for the federal funds rate to\nincrease as well — as long as inflation is near its desired levels and inflation expectations\nare well-anchored. Note that increases in interest rates may be appropriate before\nunemployment or other measures of resource slack have diminished to acceptable levels.\nFailure to act in this manner risks continuing to inject liquidity into a growing economy\nat a rate that will create inflation above desirable levels later in the cycle. If this were to\nhappen, the Fed would lose its credibility to preserve low and stable inflation.\nThis forward-looking approach to policy is symmetric in that, as economic growth\nweakens and the demand for credit declines, real interest rates will fall and so should the\nfederal funds rate. This would occur before the slower growth is likely to show up in\nconventional measures of resource slack such as unemployment. Thus, whether the\neconomy is strengthening or weakening, this view says that policy moves before\nmeasures of unemployment or other measures of resource slack provide a clear signal.\nFocusing on the short term rather than thinking ahead to the intermediate to longer term\ncan lead to policy chasing the puck, so to speak, and thus always being out-of-sync with\nits goals and objectives.\nTaking forward-looking policy actions is not an easy task. There are many real interest\nrates; they are not easily observed or measured; and they can be quite volatile. Thus,\njudging the appropriate response of policy at any point in time is fraught with challenges.\nWe must assess what the current data and market interest rates are telling us about the\nfuture. But no one said hockey was easy either. Wayne Gretzky was not the fastest, nor\n\n\f7\nthe biggest, of hockey players, but no one was as gifted as he was in looking ahead and\nanticipating where the puck would be, which is why he is known as the Great Gretzky.\nSuch forward-looking policy is equally important when it comes to inflation. Since\nexpectations play an important role in the dynamics of inflation, it is important that\npolicy act in a manner that keeps expectations well-anchored near the Fed’s inflation\nobjective. Policy must resist actions that may drive inflation above or below the level\ndeemed consistent with price stability or lead the public to believe that inflation will drift\nabove or below that level. If expectations do become unanchored, then the Fed will have\nlost its credibility and either inflation or deflation could arise. Moreover, the cost of\nregaining the Fed’s credibility may be great. So, anticipation and forward-looking policy\nare essential if the Fed is to achieve its goal of low and stable inflation.\nIn the current circumstances, the Fed will need to withdraw the extraordinary amount of\nliquidity it has provided to financial markets to ensure that the public does not lose\nconfidence in its commitment to keep inflation low and stable. If it fails to do so, rising\ninflation expectations could prompt workers to demand higher wages and firms to\ndemand higher prices to head off the expectation of higher costs, thus setting off a burst\nof inflation. For me, this risk bears careful monitoring.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the economy is emerging from a severe recession with a low level of\neconomic activity and a low rate of inflation. Improvements in the job market will lag\nbehind the rest of the economy as they typically do. Conditions in financial markets have\nbeen improving, and the need for the Fed’s extraordinary provision of liquidity will\ncontinue to dissipate in the coming months. Withdrawing that liquidity in a timely\nmanner will be important in keeping the outlook for inflation and inflation expectations\nlow and stable.\nBut to conduct monetary policy we need to be forward-looking and, looking ahead, I see\nan economy that will be growing over the next two years, which means real interest rates\nwill be rising. As they do, the federal funds rate should be permitted to rise with them.\nBy doing so, the Fed can promote stable inflationary expectations and achieve its goals of\nprice stability and sustainable growth. If it fails to do so, it risks missing its goals and\ncreating unnecessary instability in the process.\n\n\f"

These price shocks caused volatility and posed risks to\nstability in a number of countries. The general decline in economic activity and global\ntrade as the financial crisis spread around the world led to plunging prices for oil and\nother commodities in the second half of 2008 before rebounding somewhat during 2009.\nThe volatility of food and energy prices has posed — and will continue to pose —\nchallenges for central bankers, whether they are in large industrialized economies or in\nsmall emerging economies. I will discuss three approaches central bankers can take to\nprotect their credibility to control inflation in the face of these price shocks. I want to\npreface my remarks, however, by commenting on several important trends among central\nbanks, including the efforts to conduct monetary policy in a more systematic and\ntransparent manner.\nSome Trends in Central Banking\nDuring the last three decades, many central banks around the world have adapted to\nadvances in the science of monetary policy. We have learned much from the experiences\nof those central banks that were early adopters of these advances. One theme that has\nemerged from this mix of academic research and experience is the important role played\nby the public’s and market participants’ expectations regarding policy actions.\n1\n\n\fUncertainty regarding policymakers’ goals and the actions they will take to achieve them\ncan make it more difficult to achieve those goals. Moreover, this uncertainty introduces\nunnecessary volatility into economic outcomes.\nIn recognition of the importance of expectations, one trend has been the more or less\ncontinuous movement of central banks toward more transparency. That has certainly\nbeen true for the U.S., where the Federal Reserve now provides much more information\nabout its policy actions and its reasoning. For example, the Fed did not begin announcing\nits interest rate decisions until 1994, and the statement released with the announcement\nhas gradually become more informative about the Federal Open Market Committee’s\nviews. Many other developed economies and emerging economies have also moved\ntoward greater transparency.\nIn conjunction with the movement toward more transparency and the desire to align the\npublic’s expectations with monetary policy, there is a trend toward central banks publicly\nannouncing their long-term objectives. Many central banks, including a number in East\nAsia, have adopted a stated goal to keep inflation low and stable. How central banks seek\nto accomplish that goal, though, does vary. 1 Some countries — including the United\nStates and Singapore — have adopted general goals about seeking price stability without\nadopting explicit inflation targets. Other countries, starting with New Zealand 20 years\nago, have adopted explicit inflation targeting as a mechanism to demonstrate their\ncommitment to low and stable inflation. Today, more than 20 countries around the world\nhave an explicit inflation target, including four in Asia: South Korea, Thailand,\nIndonesia, and the Philippines. 2 So far, no country that adopted inflation targeting has\nchosen to abandon it.\nInflation targeting serves as a public commitment by the central bank to a clear and\nexplicit monetary goal. It does not necessarily describe how the central bank will achieve\nits goal. My view — and the view of many other economists — is that central banks and\nthe economies they serve would benefit from the adoption of simple rules or guidelines\nthat describe how policy would react to events. 3 One broad class of rules is called Taylor\nrules because they follow the work of John Taylor. 4 Because rule-like behavior by\npolicymakers reduces uncertainty about their actions, it can foster a more stable\neconomic environment. The failure of a central bank to maintain its credibility or\nreputation to achieve low and stable inflation can contribute to increased economic\nvolatility and instability.\nAnother emerging trend has been the greater use of a short-term interest rate as the\nprimary instrument of monetary policy and a decline in the number of countries pegging\ntheir exchange rate to another country’s currency bilaterally. Currency crises in countries\nall around the world have highlighted some of the challenges of such bilateral pegs and\nthe conflicts that arise when domestic policies are pursued that are inconsistent with such\n1\n\nSee, for example, McCauley (2001).\nSee Dotsey (2006); and Walsh (2009).\n3\nFor more on the benefits of systematic policy, see Plosser (2008).\n4\nSee Taylor (1993).\n2\n\n2\n\n\fregimes. As a consequence, many countries now have floating exchange rates, or they\npeg their exchange rates to a basket of currencies rather a single currency.\nAnother trend that I want to emphasize has been the movement toward greater\nindependence of central banks. Independence has contributed to the ability of central\nbanks to promote greater economic stability and lower inflation rates. It has done so\nbecause it has enabled monetary policy to take an intermediate- to long-term view\nwithout the fear or interference of short-term political concerns. Indeed, some may be\nsurprised to learn that the Bank of England, founded in 1694 and nationalized in 1946,\ndid not regain its monetary policy independence from the treasury until 1997. In general,\nthose countries whose central banks become agents for a nation’s fiscal policy risk much\nhigher rates of inflation and more pronounced economic instability.\nA theme of this conference is the challenges to domestic and international stability of\nlarge movements in the relative prices of food, water, and other important commodities.\nI want to touch on one piece of this complex challenge: the role of a central bank and\nwhat it can contribute. In my remarks today, I want to stress that by focusing on price\nstability and their credibility to maintain it, central banks can make an important and\nunique contribution to ensuring financial stability and sustainable economic growth.\nFood Price Shocks, Credibility, and Expectations\nLarge swings in food or other commodity prices can have important ramifications for\ncentral bankers and their ability to maintain a credible commitment to achieve price\nstability.\nSharp changes in food or other commodity prices typically reflect a change in the relative\nprice of food or commodities and not a change in the general level of prices, which is the\nfocus of economists’ definition of inflation (or deflation). Nevertheless, these relative\nprice changes can substantially affect a country’s consumer price index — either when\nthe basic commodities, such as food or energy, are included in the index or when\npersistent changes influence the prices of other goods and services. Consequently,\ncentral bankers find it difficult to ignore the impact of changes in food or commodity\nprices because they can affect measured inflation.\nOne reason this is so difficult to ignore is simply credibility. When central banks\npublicly state their goal to keep inflation low and stable, and then the public sees large\nchanges in consumer price indexes, the lack of consistency can harm the credibility of the\ncentral bank. A large relative price shock has the potential to undermine public\nconfidence in the central bank’s ability to keep inflation low and controlled, which in turn\ncould lead people to alter their expectations of future inflation.\nWe saw during 2007 and early 2008 that while rising energy and food price shocks hit\nmost countries, these price shocks were particularly severe for small, open economies\n\n3\n\n\fthat were net importers of food and energy, and for emerging market countries in\ngeneral. 5\nFood price shocks pose greater challenges to central banks in emerging market\neconomies, because food typically makes up a larger share of consumer spending than it\ndoes in industrialized economies. For example, in many emerging market countries in\nAsia, food accounts for 30 to nearly 50 percent of the consumption basket. In contrast,\nfood accounts for about 14 percent of South Korea’s consumer price index, which is\nsimilar to the U.S., the U.K., and the Euro area. In Singapore, food’s weight is about 25\npercent.\nFood Prices and Measures of Inflation\nHow have countries responded to the impact of food prices on their consumer price\nindexes? One approach that some countries have taken is to reduce the price volatility of\ncertain key food items by using subsidies or price controls. These approaches have been\nused to some extent even in countries that set explicit inflation targets, such as Thailand,\nthe Philippines, and Indonesia. These price controls and subsidies are generally the\nprovince of fiscal policy, and their use may at times distort assessments of how well the\ncentral bank is achieving its monetary policy goal of low and stable inflation. Moreover,\nsuch policies distort markets and, over time, could prove detrimental to the health and\nstability of the economy.\nAnother approach has been to focus on various measures of core inflation that may\nexclude food and energy, rather than total, or headline, inflation. For instance, Indonesia\nand the Philippines target headline measures of inflation, while Thailand sets an inflation\ntarget using a core measure of inflation. 6 South Korea has switched between targeting\ncore and headline inflation since it began inflation targeting in 1998, but now uses\nheadline inflation.\nWhile a core inflation measure allows a central bank to de-emphasize the effects of large\ntemporary swings in the relative price of food, the risk for policymakers is that such\nswings could persist and result in second-round effects on other prices or could increase\ninflation expectations. Ignoring these pressures may lead the central bank to fail to make\nthe adjustment necessary to prevent overall inflation.\nIn my view, it is more important that central banks focus on some measure of inflation in\nconducting monetary policy and less important whether that measure is headline inflation\nor core inflation. Over time, the trends in headline inflation and core inflation in most\ncountries tend to move together. Also, an average inflation rate over a two- or three-year\nperiod will be less subject to food price volatility than an average over a one-year period.\nConsequently, policymakers could choose either inflation measure in setting a mediumterm policy goal. For me, the key issue is that central banks seek to achieve a relatively\nstable price level, rather than the measure they choose.\n5\n6\n\nSee Habermeier, et al. (2009).\nSee McCauley (2007).\n\n4\n\n\fThree Approaches to Protect Credibility\nSince large relative price shocks have the potential to undermine public confidence in the\ncentral bank’s commitment to the goal of price stability, how can central bankers deal\nwith this risk to their credibility? There are three approaches central banks have taken to\nprotect their credibility in the face of food price or other commodity price shocks: build a\nreputation, commit to a stated goal, or establish rule-like policymaking. These are, of\ncourse, closely tied to my introductory remarks about the trends in central banking.\nSome central banks gain reputations for keeping inflation low and stable. This takes time\nand perseverance and usually occurs after painful bouts of high inflation. That was the\ncase for the Federal Reserve in the U.S. after the so-called “Great Inflation” of the 1970s\nand early 1980s. Double-digit inflation led the Federal Reserve to engage in a long-term\nprocess of disinflation. By the early 1990s, the Fed had earned a reputation for\nmaintaining a low and stable rate of inflation. Even so, the Fed also had to act promptly\nand preemptively against the emergence of several inflationary “scares” in the late 1980s\nand early 1990s in order to secure and preserve its reputation and credibility for keeping\ninflation low. 7\nOther countries have similarly earned reputations for being committed to keeping\ninflation low. Such reputations can help avoid shifts in the public’s expectations of\ninflation when food price shocks temporarily increase consumer prices.\nCommitting to a stated goal to keep inflation low and stable can also help a central bank\nprotect its credibility when food price shocks occur. This is true whether the central bank\nhas set a general goal of price stability or an explicit inflation target. Indeed, there is\nsome evidence that countries that have adopted inflation targeting have better anchored\ninflation expectations than countries that have not adopted such targeting. 8 In emerging\nmarkets, inflation targeting is found to reduce the level and volatility of inflation\nexpectations, while simultaneously lowering the overall rate of inflation. 9\nMore importantly in light of the current financial crisis and the concerns expressed in\nsome countries, including the U.S., about deflation, establishing an inflation target would\nhelp prevent expectations of deflation from materializing. Thus, a credible inflation target\nhas the benefit of minimizing the volatility stemming from unanchored inflation\nexpectations to either the upside or the downside.\nOne advantage of an inflation target is that it usually requires the central banks to explain\ndeviations from the target and a time path for returning inflation to the target.\nSometimes, acceptable reasons for the departures are spelled out in advance. New\nZealand’s Policy Targeting Agreement, for instance, specified a number of situations in\n\n7\n\nFor a discussion of such episodes in the U.S., see Goodfriend (1993).\nSee Batini, et al. (2005), p. 171; Gürkaynak, et al. (2006); Dotsey, (2006), p. 18; and Walsh (2009), pp.\n14-15.\n9\nSee Batini, et al. (2005), p. 171-72 and Table 4.6.\n8\n\n5\n\n\fwhich temporary deviations from price stability might be warranted, including several\nfactors that would affect food prices. 10\nOther countries have also stated reasons as to why the actual inflation rate might deviate\nfrom the central bank’s inflation target. For example, the British government’s\ninstructions to the Bank of England recognized that shocks and disturbances could lead to\nshort-term departures from the target. Among those countries in Asia that have chosen to\ntarget inflation explicitly, the Philippines has a list of acceptable circumstances for failing\nto achieve the inflation target, including the volatility of agricultural products. 11\nThese examples make clear that inflation-targeting central banks can at times use specific\nallowances to explain why actual inflation may temporarily deviate from the desired\ninflation target. But central bankers must be careful not to create so many exceptions as\nto undermine the whole purpose of inflation targeting, which is to reinforce the credibility\nof the central bank’s commitment to achieving its monetary policy goals.\nSystematic M onetar y Policy and R ule-L ike Policymaking\nWe have already discussed the first two means by which central banks can protect its\ncredibility when food price shocks occur: building a reputation for maintaining a low and\nstable rate of inflation, and establishing an explicit goal such as adopting an inflation\ntarget. A third related approach is to establish systematic, rule-like policymaking.\nBy systematic, I mean a policy that is consistent, transparent, and predictable. This\napproach allows households and businesses to more accurately form expectations and\ntherefore make better decisions. Systematic, rule-like policy leads to a more stable,\npredictable, and efficient economy. Systematic approaches can also help a central bank\ndeal with temporary food price shocks.\nJohn Taylor described the most well-known form of systematic monetary policy when he\nexplored how the Federal Reserve should set its federal funds rate target. 12 While U.S.\nmonetary policy was the initial focus of his work, there are many variations of Taylor’s\nrules, which all share the vital characteristic that they systematically describe the\nbehavior of policy. In particular, these rules typically indicate that policy should respond\naggressively to deviations of inflation from its target and respond to some measure of\nresource utilization in a more muted manner. These simple Taylor-like rules have the\nadvantage of making it easier for the public and financial markets to form expectations\nabout policy and can therefore contribute to a more stable and efficiently functioning\neconomy.\nSome analysts have described the monetary policy of the Monetary Authority of\nSingapore as using a Taylor-like rule, with the exchange rate as the policy instrument,\n\n10\n\nSee Walsh (2009), p. 20.\nSee Central Bank of the Philippines, 2008, p. iv.\n12\nSee Taylor (1993).\n11\n\n6\n\n\finstead of a short-term interest rate. 13 Although this Singapore variation differs from the\nusual Taylor rule, it nonetheless has some similarities to a rule-like, systematic approach\nto monetary policy.\nE xper ience with I nflation T ar geting\nAs I noted earlier, price shocks from food and other commodities pose a risk to the\ncredibility of the central bank’s commitment to low and stable inflation and can therefore\nalter the public’s expectations of future inflation. Anchoring these expectations is very\nimportant for ensuring price stability in all economies, both emerging and industrialized\nones. However, because relative price shocks generally have larger effects on measured\ninflation in emerging market economies, those countries may have more to gain from\nadopting policy approaches — such as inflation targeting — that better anchor inflation\nexpectations.\nThe broad conclusion from a number of studies is that inflation targeting in emerging\nmarket countries has resulted in lower inflation, lower volatility of inflation, less\npersistence of inflation, and a better anchoring of inflation expectations. Just as\nimportantly, and despite claims to the contrary, inflation-targeting countries have not\nexperienced adverse consequences for real output or employment. 14\nEvidence from industrialized countries also indicates that inflation expectations are better\nanchored in those countries that have adopted inflation targeting. 15 Consequently, all\ncountries that adopt inflation targeting have greater protection from the adverse effects of\nlarge relative price shocks to food, energy, or other commodities. What’s more, this\nanchoring of inflation expectations helps maintain the credibility of the central bank’s\ncommitment to inflation targeting.\nIt is also important to acknowledge that for emerging economies, large swings in relative\nprices, particularly food and energy, can have detrimental effects on an economy and its\ncitizens. It is generally a mistake, however, to view monetary policy as a tool to mitigate\nthose effects directly. Movements in relative prices drive resource allocations, and one\ncannot and should not think of monetary policy as a tool to prevent those sometimes\npainful adjustments.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, let me stress that pursuing sound monetary policy is fundamentally\nimportant to ensuring international financial stability. In the midst of the current\nfinancial crisis, we must remember that instability in the general level of prices —\nwhether inflation or deflation — is itself a significant source of financial instability.\n13\n\nSee McCauley (2001), pp. 14-15; and Parrado (2004).\nFor a recent overview of evidence on inflation targeting, see Walsh (2009). Also see Lin and Ye (2009);\nGonçalvas and Salles (2008); Batini, et al. (2005); Varella Mollick, et al. (2008); and Vega and Winkelried\n(2005).\n15\nSee Walsh (2009), p. 17; and Gürkaynak, et al. (2006).\n14\n\n7\n\n\fConsequently, central banks around the world should ensure that they fulfill their unique\nresponsibility to ensure price stability. Failure to ensure price stability, in my view,\nwould certainly pose a major risk to international stability.\nLarge relative price shocks to food and energy pose problems for central banks because\nthey can alter expectations of inflation and undermine the credibility of central banks’\ncommitment to price stability.\nTo promote price stability, ensure credibility, and anchor expectations, central bankers\nshould pursue systematic monetary policies. Such systematic policies should be\nconsistent, transparent, and largely predictable. Central banks should communicate\nclearly about their policy goals, about the reasons for near-term deviations from those\ngoals — such as the impact of food price shocks on measured inflation — and about the\npolicy actions they are taking over a medium-term horizon to keep inflation low.\nI have found it encouraging that, despite large swings in food and energy prices in recent\nyears, inflation expectations in most countries have remained quite well anchored. I\nbelieve that the stability of inflation expectations in the face of wide swings in measured\ninflation reflects the benefits of a more systematic and transparent approach to monetary\npolicy that many central banks have adopted. Such policies, as well as the adoption of\nexplicit inflation targeting in more than 20 countries, have bolstered the credibility of\ncentral banks’ commitment to price stability. I believe that credible monetary policy also\nbetter positions a central bank to contain the risk that food or energy price shocks will\nalter inflation expectations or inflation itself.\n\n8\n\n\fREFERENCES\nBatini, Nicoletta, Kenneth Kuttner, and Douglas Laxton. “Does Inflation Targeting Work\nin Emerging Markets?” International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, Chapter\nIV (September 2005), p.171.\nCentral Bank of the Philippines.

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fSound Monetary Policy for Good Times and Bad\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nMerk Investments/Stanford SIEPR Panel\nStanford University\nPalo Alto, California\nOctober 20, 2009\n\nI am delighted to be on tonight’s program, especially with an old friend and one of the\nmost respected contributors to the science of monetary policy: Bill Poole. I have known\nBill for nearly 30 years, and as both of us chose to move from academia into\npolicymaking, we share some experiences that such a transition offers. I have learned\nand continue to learn a great deal from him, and so can you. So that makes tonight’s\nevent very special.\nThe theme of this evening’s discussion is “Monetary Policy in a Tough Environment.”\nWell, that is an apt description of the world around us for the last two years. Policy\nchoices have been difficult. No one likes to be forced to choose the least bad option\namong an even worse set of alternatives. Unfortunately, policymakers have, more than\nonce, faced just such a choice during this crisis.\nThe key message I want to leave you with this evening is that good policy — and by that\nI mean policy that is clearly defined and systematically followed — should apply in good\ntimes as well as in tough times. I do not mean that policy actions should necessarily be\nthe same in both good and bad economic times. Yet, in each environment, we should\nconduct policy in a systematic way, one that is consistent, transparent, and largely\npredictable.\nA systematic approach to policymaking does not mean that we can know what the future\nholds or what future policy decisions will be. You often hear Fed officials say that policy\ndecisions are “data dependent” and, indeed, they are. This means that future policy\nactions are conditional on how the economic data unfold — because the data inform our\neconomic outlook. The incoming economic data should feed into a decision-making\nprocess in a mostly systematic way.\nSome people think of this systematic approach to policy as a “reaction function” or what\neconomists call a state-contingent plan with parameters that are largely stable over time.\nThis approach is sometimes called “rule-like” policymaking. 1\n1\n\nSee Charles Plosser, “The Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy,” speech given to the National\nAssociation for Business Economics, Washington Economic Policy Conference, Washington, D.C. (March\n3, 2008).\n\n1\n\n\fOf course, the alternative to rule-like policy is discretionary policy, in which\npolicymakers are free to choose whatever action seems appropriate or convenient at the\ntime. Rules act as restrictions on policymakers’ choices — limiting the degree of\ndiscretion. But this is not a bad thing; rather, it can result in better economic outcomes in\nthe long run.\nOver the last three decades, economic theory and experience have taught us a lot about\ngood monetary policy, and many central banks around the world have put these lessons\ninto practice. Among the most important lessons are that policy should have clear\nobjectives and be systematic in its approach to achieving them. Doing so promotes both\ntransparency and predictability, which allow households and businesses to more\naccurately form expectations and therefore make better decisions. As a result, systematic\npolicy promotes a more stable, predictable, and efficient economy.\nTonight I want to suggest ways to apply systematic approaches to central bank\npolicymaking. I believe that this is the best way to ensure that policymaking will be better\nprepared for the next “tough environment,” whenever it comes and whatever its source.\nIt also helps to avoid sowing the seeds of a new crisis.\nI want to stress that a systematic approach applies not just to traditional monetary policy\nbut also to a central bank’s role as the lender of last resort. While these two aspects of\ncentral banking are different, the approach to policymaking ought to be the same — that\nis, systematic, consistent, transparent, and largely predictable — whether in good times or\nbad.\nSystematic Monetary Policy\nTo adopt a systematic approach to monetary policy, we first must ensure that policy has\nclear, well-defined, and feasible objectives. Congress has established our so-called dual\nmandate that monetary policy seek to achieve price stability and maximum employment.\nPolicymakers must credibly commit to take actions that will deliver on these stated\nobjectives. Many economists and central bankers believe that creating an environment of\nstable prices is the most valuable contribution a central bank can make to promoting\nmaximum employment and sustainable economic growth. What’s more, central banks\nhave a unique responsibility for price stability, at least in a flexible exchange rate regime.\nAs a consequence, central banks in a number of countries have adopted institutional\nmechanisms to reinforce the credibility of their commitment to such an objective.\nOne such approach is to adopt an explicit inflation target, which I and other economists\nhave long proposed as a way to help clarify the central bank’s policy objective and as a\nway to publicly commit the institution to a feasible goal easily understood by all. This\ncan help to anchor inflation expectations if the public finds the commitment credible. A\nlack of confidence in the central bank’s commitment to maintain price stability, for\nexample, can lead to rising inflation expectations that prompt workers and firms to\ndemand higher wages and prices to head off the expectation of higher costs, thus setting\noff a burst of inflation. A credible inflation target would not only help prevent inflation\n2\n\n\fexpectations and actual inflation from rising to undesirable levels, but it would also help\nprevent expectations of deflation from materializing that could initiate an undesirable\nepisode of falling prices.\nMarvin Goodfriend, for example, has documented episodes during the 1980s and early\n1990s when markets lost confidence in the Fed’s commitment to price stability. During\nthese episodes — which Goodfriend calls inflation scares 2 — long-term interest rates\nrose sharply as expectations of inflation rose. To restore the Fed’s credibility and ensure\nbetter long-run economic outcomes, the Fed had to aggressively increase short-term\ninterest rates to reduce inflation expectations, even though doing so risked potentially\nundesirable consequences for the broader economy.\nDeflation scares can be just as problematic. Twice in this decade alone we have seen\nconcerns that deflation may pose a threat. In 2003, the Fed responded by dropping the\nnominal federal funds rate target to 1 percent and holding it there for a prolonged period\nto reassure the public and markets of its commitment to price stability. Many have argued\nthat by doing so, we risked contributing to excessive asset-price speculation.\nJust this year, concerns about deflation surfaced again. Yet with the federal funds rate\nalready near zero, the Fed could not cut rates further. So, with expectations of deflation\nlooming, real, or inflation-adjusted, short-term interest rates were rising, potentially\nputting at risk the economy’s recovery.\nThese cases help illustrate that maintaining a firm commitment to low and stable inflation\nhelps prevent inflation expectations from rising or falling, which promotes a more\nsustainable and robust economy. The greater predictability of an inflation-targeting\nregime amounts to articulating in advance the “rules of the game” as best as possible —\neven in a crisis. In this way, systematic policy can provide an important stabilizing\ninfluence on the real economy at a time when it is very much needed.\nA frequently expressed concern is that an inflation-targeting regime is unresponsive to\nfluctuations in the real economy. This is a misconception. The economy is constantly\nbuffeted by shocks, and markets respond by making adjustments in prices and quantities\nas required. One of those important prices is the real interest rate. It is not a constant but\nmoves around. Monetary policy must recognize this and adjust accordingly. If the real\ninterest rate falls, signaling weak growth, then so must the nominal federal funds rate if\ninflation is near the target. Otherwise, policy would be fostering an inflation rate below\nits target. Likewise, as economic growth rates and real interest rates rise, the nominal\nfederal funds rate must also rise in order to keep inflation from rising above the desired\nrate. This is not necessarily an easy or straightforward task, but it is nonetheless the\nappropriate way to think about policy.\nOne of the most well-known forms of systematic monetary policy was described by John\nTaylor when he explored how the central bank should set the short-term nominal interest\n2\n\nSee Marvin Goodfriend, “Interest Rate Policy and the Inflation Scare Problem: 1979-1992,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly (Winter 1993), pp 1-23.\n\n3\n\n\frate. 3 These Taylor rules require central banks to have an inflation target of some kind,\nand they are more explicit about exactly how the central bank should respond to\ndeviations from the target. There are many variations of Taylor’s rule, but all share the\nvital characteristic that they systematically describe the behavior of policy. Another\nadvantage of these simple Taylor-like rules is that they make it easier for the public and\nfinancial markets to form expectations about policy, and therefore, they can contribute to\na more stable and efficiently functioning economy.\nSome of these Taylor-like rules yield very good results in a variety of theoretical settings\nbecause they produce outcomes close to those of the theoretically optimal rule. 4\nFurthermore, this occurs in a wide variety of models of the type actually used to shape\nour forecasts and our understanding of actual economic events. 5\nIn these simple rules, the interest rate generally responds aggressively to inflation or to\nthe forecast of inflation, which implies that the real rate of interest should rise when\ninflation or projected inflation increases above its target. Although these rules imply that\nthe interest rate should respond positively to deviations of actual output from some\nmeasure of “potential output,” the interest rate’s response to output movements is usually\nquite a bit smaller than its response to inflation.\nEconomists generally view these Taylor-like rules as working in both good and bad\ntimes. When economic activity is rapidly growing and inflation is rising, the rule would\nbe systematically applied to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check. When\neconomic activity is declining and inflation is slowing, the rule would ease interest rates\nto foster the conditions that enable households and businesses to make the necessary\nadjustments to return the economy to its long-term growth path.\nAs the economic outlook worsened in late 2007 and 2008 and we experienced the early\nstages of the financial crisis, the FOMC lowered its federal funds rate target more than\nmany versions of Taylor-like rules would have required. When monetary policymakers\nwho follow a rule choose to significantly deviate from the rule for unusual and temporary\nreasons, they must be transparent in explaining why so as not to undermine their\ncredibility with the public regarding their systematic approach to policy goals. In light of\nthe severity of the disruptions to financial markets during this crisis, explaining such a\ndeviation might not have been difficult for the Fed or other central banks during this\nperiod.\nHowever, with a major financial crisis and the federal funds rate target reaching the zero\nbound, implementing an interest rate rule can become problematic. In particular, during\n3\n\nSee John B. Taylor, “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series\non Public Policy 39 (1993), pp. 195-214.\n4\nSee Plosser’s March 3, 2008 speech cited in footnote 1.\n5\nSee Andrew Levin, Volker Wieland, and John C. Williams, “The Performance of Forecast-Based\nMonetary Policy Rules under Model Uncertainty,” American Economic Review 93:3 (June 2003), pp. 62245. Also see Stephanie Schmitt-Grohe and Martin Uribe, “Optimal Simple and Implementable Monetary\nand Fiscal Rules,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Working Paper 2007-24 (2007).\n\n4\n\n\fthe depth of the financial crisis and amid the sharp declines in economic activity, some\nversions of the Taylor rule called for reductions in real interest rates that would have\nmeant further cuts in the nominal federal funds rate target when it was already near zero.\nSince that is not feasible, economists and policymakers have to consider how to adapt\nsuch policy rules. Some have suggested that in such circumstances, quantitative rules are\nmore appropriate, perhaps similar to the rules suggested by Bennett McCallum that focus\non growth of the monetary base. 6 Such rules could be mapped into metrics for assessing\nthe appropriate degree of quantitative easing or the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet.\nAs we review the current crisis, economists and policymakers will need to determine the\nappropriate extent of deviations from a policy rule. We might also ask if there are\nvariations of these rules that could be articulated in advance and that would be more\nadaptable in the extreme circumstances we have witnessed during this crisis.\nNevertheless, by using simple rules as the benchmark, policymakers would be forced to\nexplain deviations, thereby helping to make policy more transparent.\nIf we are to keep expectations of inflation well-anchored, departures from a systematic\napproach to monetary policy must be clearly communicated and promptly reversed as\nconditions return to normal. Otherwise, we risk eroding the public’s confidence in our\ncommitment to deliver price stability, and we know from the 1970s and early 1980s that\nthe cost of regaining the public’s confidence can be quite high.\nThis leads me to my last point concerning systematic monetary policy. In order to capture\nthe benefits of such a policy, the public must believe that policymakers will stick to their\ngoals and the rules adopted to achieve them. If policymakers fail to act in a way\nconsistent with the stated objectives, credibility is lost and the public becomes uncertain\nabout how policymakers will react in the future. That is surely a recipe for volatility, not\nstability. This is one reason transparency is important. When policymakers are\ntransparent about how they are setting policy, the public can verify that policymakers are\nacting in a way consistent with their stated objectives, and thus, the policymakers gain\ncredibility and the economy gains stability.\n\nSystematic Lender-of-Last-Resort Policy\nJust as we need to pursue a systematic approach to monetary policy, I believe we must\nalso apply a systematic approach to the central bank’s financial stability policy,\n\n6\n\nSee Bennett McCallum, “Robustness Properties of a Rule for Monetary Policy,” Carnegie- Rochester\nConference Series on Public Policy 29 (Autumn 1988), pp. 173-203. McCallum proposed a rule that calls\nfor varying the growth rate of the monetary base (currency and bank reserves) in response to variations in\nnominal GDP and a proxy for long-run trends in money demand. The rule specifies a target for nominal\nGDP that is the sum of the economy’s long-run trend growth of real GDP and a desired or targeted inflation\nrate. If nominal GDP growth is above the target, the rule calls for reducing the growth rate of the monetary\nbase and vice versa.\n\n5\n\n\fparticularly its policy actions as the lender of last resort. In light of the crisis, academics\nand policymakers are taking a much greater interest in this aspect of central banking.\nThe best guide to a systematic lender of last resort policy dates back to Walter Bagehot’s\nsimple rule of lending freely to solvent banks at a penalty rate against good collateral. 7\nDuring the past year, the Fed has taken extraordinary actions to ensure financial stability\nthat have gone far beyond this concept. Some of these actions have supported markets in\nwhich intermediation was severely impaired; others have supported the ongoing survival\nof institutions deemed too big to fail.\nFinancial market conditions have continued to improve over the past year. However, I\nbelieve abandoning Bagehot’s simple rule has increased moral hazard and the associated\nrisk for our financial system.\nBecause a financial crisis of this magnitude does not occur often, policymakers had little\nexperience to draw upon. As events moved quickly, we ended up learning as we went.\nSo it is probably not surprising that policy reactions appeared, at times, erratic, rather\nthan systematic. Yet, in the process, we have learned that not having a clearly\ncommunicated systematic approach to our lending that covers bad — and really bad —\ntimes can be very confusing to the public and the markets.\nThis was underscored by the public and market reaction to the Fed’s and the Treasury’s\nvarying approaches during 2008 to the serious problems that arose at three financial\nfirms: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and the global insurer AIG. The lack of a clearly\nunderstood approach to the government’s and the Fed’s decisions about when assistance\nefforts would be provided created confusion and uncertainty.\nA significant factor contributing to the difficult policy choices was the lack of an explicit\nresolution mechanism for the orderly failure of a systemically important nonbank\nfinancial firm. In fact, we still do not have such a mechanism 18 months after the Bear\nStearns merger. The lack of a well-articulated systematic approach to the Fed’s lending\nrole contributed to uncertainty in financial markets about who would be “rescued” and\nwho would not. That uncertainty still remains and must be one of the prime objectives of\npolicy reforms going forward.\nI believe that no firm should be too big to fail and that a body other than the Fed should\nhave the authority to fail these firms, wipe out shareholders’ stakes in the firm, force\nuninsured creditors to take haircuts, and unwind the firm in an orderly manner. The real\nchallenge in such an approach is whether a policymaker can make a credible commitment\nto behave in such a manner. Won’t there always be some firms that might gamble on a\nrescue in something like a game of chicken with the government? Does this really\neliminate moral hazard? Probably not entirely, but it is likely to substantially improve the\nsituation.\n7\n\nWalter Bagehot, Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market (New York: E.P. Dutton and\nCompany, 1921). [Orig.pub. 1873]\n\n6\n\n\fAs the crisis unfolded and problems arose in different parts of the financial system, the\nFed responded by trying to increase liquidity in several markets through special lending\nprograms. These programs may have had some stabilizing effects on markets and may\nhave lowered some spreads. Yet, without defining in advance a systematic and consistent\napproach to such lending, these programs also raised uncertainty — in this case, about\nwho would or would not have access to the various facilities. This was illustrated when\nthe Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (or TALF) was announced. Many market\nparticipants lobbied for expanding the categories of securities eligible for the program.\nDid these multiple lending programs keep lenders on the sidelines waiting to see which\nasset classes the Fed would support and which it would not? Did this delay the healing of\nthe financial markets?\nIn hindsight, a basic problem was that, in our desire to get financial markets working\nagain, we offered no systematic view as to how and where the Fed would intervene — we\nlacked a well-communicated systematic approach. Moreover, to my way of thinking, we\nstrayed into credit allocation that, in my view, should be the purview of fiscal authorities\nand not the central bank.\nGoing forward, to promote a clearer distinction between monetary policy and fiscal\npolicy and help safeguard the Fed’s independence, I have advocated that the Fed and the\nTreasury should agree that the Treasury will take the non-Treasury assets and nondiscount window loans from the Fed’s balance sheet in exchange for Treasury securities. 8\nSuch a new “accord” would transfer funding for these special credit programs to the\nTreasury — which would issue Treasury securities to fund the transfer — thus ensuring\nthat these extraordinary credit policies are under the oversight of the fiscal authority,\nwhere such policies rightfully belong. The accord would return control of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet to the Fed, so that it can continue to conduct independent monetary policy. 9\nI would go further and suggest that the Fed adopt an “all Treasuries policy” for the\nsecurities held on its balance sheet and follow Bagehot’s principle for the loans on its\nbalance sheet — which in a crisis would mean the Fed would lend freely to solvent firms\nwith good collateral at a penalty rate.\n\n8\n\nSee Charles Plosser, “Ensuring Sound Monetary Policy in the Aftermath of Crisis,” speech given to the\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum, The Initiative on Global Markets, University of Chicago Booth School of\nBusiness, New York, NY (February 27, 2009). For a discussion of such an accord between the Fed and the\nTreasury in a different context, see J. Alfred Broaddus, Jr. and Marvin Goodfriend’s article, “What Assets\nShould the Federal Reserve Buy?” and Goodfriend’s article, “Why We Need an ‘Accord’ for Federal\nReserve Credit Policy: A Note,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly (Winter 2001).\nSuch an accord would also be consistent with the recommendations made by the Group of Thirty’s\nWorking Group on Financial Reform about the role of central banks in providing financial stability. See\n“Financial Reform: A Framework for Financial Stability,” Group of Thirty, Washington, D.C. (2009).\n9\nThere is a historical precedent for such an accord. In 1951, the Treasury and the Fed struck an accord that\nfreed the Fed from pegging the interest rate on long-term Treasury debt below 2.5 percent, which the Fed\nhad done during and after World War II. For several articles about the 1951 Accord, see the Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond’s Economic Quarterly (Winter 2001).\n\n7\n\n\fI believe we must specify in advance the conditions under which the central bank would\nserve as a lender of last resort. This policy should be systematic and should apply to both\ngood times and bad. It should have clear, realistic, and feasible objectives; it should be\nconsistent, transparent, and predictable; and it should operate independently of interest\ngroup pressures to lend to specific sectors or industries.\nDeveloping such a systematic approach is not easy. Making a credible commitment to\nstick to such a lending policy in good times and bad is even more difficult. Nevertheless,\nthat is what we must tackle if we are going to achieve better results the next time a crisis\narises.\nConclusion\nGoing forward, the Fed as well as other policymakers should strive to follow a\nsystematic, more “rule-like” approach in bad times as well as good. Developing and\nimplementing such systematic rules for making sound policy in all seasons deserves more\nattention by policymakers because they would yield better economic outcomes for both\nmonetary policy and financial stability policy. I believe that times of crisis are precisely\nwhen sound principles and a systematic approach to policy are most needed.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n“Demystifying the Economy”\nLafayette College Policy Studies Program\nFarinon College Center, Lafayette College\nEaston, PA\nSeptember 29, 2009\n\nI want to thank Lafayette College, the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, the\nLehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation, and the Lehigh Valley Workforce\nInvestment Board for sponsoring tonight’s program.\nWhen Mark Crain first wrote to propose this event, I noted with more than a passing\ninterest that he is the William E. Simon Professor here at Lafayette. Having spent so\nmuch of my career as a professor and then as dean of the William E. Simon Graduate\nSchool of Business Administration at the University of Rochester, and having worked\nwith Bill Simon over the years, I felt confident that this would bode well for a successful\nevent.\nMoreover, my ties to Lafayette extend somewhat beyond the fact that it is an\noutstanding educational institution within the Philadelphia Fed’s District. Two of your\ncurrent trustees are old friends. One of them, of course, is Peter Simon, Class of ’75,\nwho served on the Simon School’s advisory council the entire time I was dean, and the\nother is my former colleague Michael Moskow, Class of ‘59, who was president of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago until he retired from that post in 2007.\nFor over three decades, my academic research and teaching centered on the subjects of\nmacroeconomics, monetary theory, and finance. And for the past three years, I have\nhad the rare opportunity to serve as a monetary policymaker on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, or FOMC. I am delighted, therefore, to have the opportunity to\ndiscuss my perspective on monetary policy and the economy, in what has been an\nextraordinary episode in this nation’s economic history.\nTo put the current episode in some perspective, incoming freshmen at Lafayette College\nwere born around the time of the 1990-1991 recession. As recessions go, that was a\nmild one, only eight months long, with real GDP falling about 1.3 percent from its peak\nin 1990 to the recession’s trough in early 1991. That period was also a time of a severe\nfinancial crisis when hundreds of banks and savings and loan institutions failed. At the\n\n\fpeak of this crisis in 1989, 534 institutions failed. In 1990, we saw 382 failures and\nanother 271 in 1991.\nNow, as Lafayette freshmen enter college, the economy is again in recession — in fact,\nthe deepest recession since the Great Depression; so far real GDP has fallen 3.7 percent\nsince its peak at the end of 2007. Residential and nonresidential real estate problems\nabound, and we again see a financial crisis and a rising number of bank failures. By way\nof comparison, last year 30 banks failed around the country, and so far this year, we\nhave 95 failures. Thus, despite the recent talk about massive bank failures, we are a\nlong way from the magnitude of failures we experienced during the so-called S&L crisis\nof the late 1980s and early 90s, and I doubt we will come anywhere close to that level.\nSuch periods of economic turmoil — whether the early 1990s or now — inevitably have\na way of raising the visibility of the Federal Reserve. While many Americans hear about\nthe Fed in the news every day, not everyone knows how we work or how we are\nstructured. So, I thought I would begin with some background to help demystify the\nFederal Reserve.\nThen, I want to share some thoughts on current economic conditions at the national\nlevel, in our region, and here in the Lehigh Valley, as well as my outlook for the\nrecovery. In doing so I will offer my perspective about some of the challenges facing the\nFed as it seeks to ensure price stability and sustainable economic growth.\nThe Historical Basis for a Decentralized Fed\nFirst, a little history about central banking in the U.S. Just a few blocks from the\nPhiladelphia Fed stand the vestiges of our country’s two earlier attempts at a central\nbank. The intellectual father of central banking in the United States was, of course,\nAlexander Hamilton. He spoke out fervently for the creation of the first Bank of the\nUnited States, which became our nation’s first central bank. It received a 20-year\ncharter from Congress and operated from 1791 to 1811. Although its charter was not\nrenewed, the War of 1812 and the ensuing inflation and economic turmoil convinced\nCongress to establish the second Bank of the United States, which operated under its\nown congressional charter from 1816 to 1836. However, as with its predecessor,\nCongress did not renew its charter. Public distrust of centralized power was an\nimportant factor that led to the demise of both banks. Both became entangled in\npolitics and failed to find the balance and independence necessary to serve our vast and\ndiverse country. 1\n\n1\n\nFor more information, see History of Central Banking, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 2009, and\nThe First Bank of the United States: A Chapter in the History of Central Banking, Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia, 2009.\n\n\fIt was almost 80 years before the nation was ready to try again. When President\nWoodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law in 1913, it included an\ningenious compromise — a decentralized central banking system. This unique structure\nhelped overcome political and public opposition that stemmed from fears that this new\ncentral bank would be dominated either by political interests in Washington or by\nfinancial interests in New York.\nTo balance political, economic, and geographic interests, Congress created the Federal\nReserve System with 12 regional Reserve Banks throughout the country, overseen by a\nBoard of Governors in Washington, D.C. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank is the\nThird District, which includes Delaware, the southern half of New Jersey, and the\neastern two-thirds of Pennsylvania. The Reserve Banks distribute currency, act as\nbankers’ banks, and generally perform the functions of a central bank, including serving\nas the federal government’s fiscal agent.\nThe Reserve Banks have many features of private-sector corporations, including\nstockholders, in the form of private banks in each District that pay in capital. Each\nReserve Bank has its own board of directors drawn from its District’s banks, businesses,\nand the public in a nonpolitical process. One very important responsibility of these\ndirectors is to select the Reserve Bank’s president, subject to the Federal Reserve Board\nof Governors’ approval. Because of this structure, Reserve Bank presidents have direct\nlinks to the public — the men and women on Main Street and the business communities\nwithin their Districts. Through this interaction, each Reserve Bank seeks to keep\ninformed about its region’s economic and financial developments.\nThe Fed Governors, on the other hand, are political appointees, nominated by the\nPresident and confirmed by the Senate. In order to insulate the central bank and the\nFed Governors from short-term political pressures and to encourage them to take a\nlong-term perspective on the economy, Congress limits each Fed Governor to one full\n14-year term. 2 Congress also made the Board of Governors independent from the\nTreasury and the administration.\nReserve Bank presidents and the Governors come together every six to eight weeks for\nmeetings of the FOMC to make monetary policy decisions. As I prepare for these\nmeetings, I receive a lot of information about business and financial conditions from\ncontacts throughout the mid-Atlantic region, as well as from contacts in the national\nand international business communities. At the FOMC meetings, my fellow Fed\npresidents and I share the information we have gathered with each other and with the\nFed Governors. As you might imagine, a variety of views are expressed during these\nmeetings. The diversity of views regarding both the state of the economy and\nappropriate policy results in a vital and healthy discussion that shapes the FOMC’s\nmonetary policy decisions and, I believe, leads to better policies.\n2\n\nGovernors can finish out a previous appointee’s term prior to serving their own full term.\n\n\fThis mix of private and public governance makes the Federal Reserve System uniquely\nAmerican. It provides a valuable form of checks and balances — between centralization\nand decentralization, between the public and private sectors, and between Wall Street,\nWashington, and Main Street — all to ensure that policy decisions are balanced and\nindependent. I might add that the Fed receives no government appropriations from\nCongress. In fact, the System turns over any excess earnings on its portfolio of securities\nand loans above the cost of its operations to the U.S. Treasury, which in 2008 amounted\nto nearly $35 billion.\nThe independence of the Fed is critical to its ability to achieve the monetary policy\nobjectives that Congress has established: maximum employment, stable prices, and\nmoderate long-term interest rates. Research has shown that countries with more\nindependent central banks have lower rates of inflation on average, without sacrificing\nreal economic growth.\nWhy is independence so important for monetary policy and the central bank’s ability to\nachieve its objectives? The easiest way to see this is to recognize that monetary policy\ndecisions affect the economy with a long and variable lag. Actions that policymakers\ntake today will likely not have much impact on the economy or inflation for many\nquarters. Consequently, monetary policy must be forward-looking. Policymakers must\nanticipate what the economy will look like over the next one to three years.\nDespite the best of intentions, the political environment tends to be focused much more\non the short-term and has great difficulty looking beyond the next news cycle, let alone\nbeyond the next election. Thus, political interests are likely to encourage policy\ndecisions that place undue weight on the very short-term consequences of those\nchoices relative to the long-run interests of the economy. The Fed’s independence is\ncorrectly intended to provide the opportunity for central bankers to take that long-term\nperspective, unencumbered by short-term political pressures. It also helps prevent the\ngovernment from using the central bank to fund off-budget spending plans or to more\ndirectly fund budget deficits. And, as I mentioned, evidence from around the world and\nthrough history demonstrates that monetary policies set by central banks with less\npolitical interference or influence yield better economic outcomes.\nFed independence, however, does not mean the Fed is unaccountable. Ultimately, the\nFed is accountable to the American people as it seeks to ensure price stability and\npromote sustainable economic growth. The Fed reports regularly to Congress about its\nmonetary policy goals and its efforts to achieve them. It also regularly produces a\nwealth of data on its balance sheet and financial positions. In a democracy, our\nindependence requires that we be as transparent as possible, consistent with fulfilling\nour mandate. We have made great strides at becoming more transparent in the last\ntwo decades, and we will continue to seek ways to do so.\n\n\fWith that as background, let me turn to the economy and its prospects.\nThe Economy in the Nation and Region\nAfter more than 20 months of the deepest recession since the 1930s, signs are finally\nindicating that the economy is turning a corner and prospects for a return to growth are\nincreasing. It is certainly a different picture from a year ago. Then, in the face of the\nsteadily deteriorating economy and severe financial crisis, the Fed was aggressively\neasing monetary policy by reducing the target federal funds rate to near zero. We also\nput in place many special lending facilities and more than doubled the Fed’s balance\nsheet, to over $2 trillion. This year, we are seeing a decline in the use of a number of\nthese special lending facilities as financial markets have begun to function more\nsmoothly again.\nThe economy is now in a transition from the sharp contraction we experienced in late\n2008 and early 2009 to expansion. Real GDP decreased at an annual rate of only 1\npercent in the second quarter, a vast improvement from the previous two quarters in\nwhich we saw declines of 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2009 and 5.4 percent in the\nfourth quarter of 2008.\nAs usual in such transitions, I expect some ups and downs in the incoming economic\ndata, but over the balance of this year and into 2010, I expect that the good news will\nincreasingly outweigh the bad news. For some time, I have anticipated that the second\nhalf of this year would exhibit positive growth, and my confidence in this outlook is\ngrowing. In the last couple of months, many private forecasters have substantially\nincreased their own outlooks for the second half of the year. In the second quarter, our\nBank’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, the oldest quarterly survey of\nmacroeconomic forecasts in the country, predicted real GDP growth of about 1 percent\nin the second half. In our third quarter survey, however, the forecasters raised their\nsecond-half forecast to 2.3 percent — a significant improvement in their outlook in just\nthree months. 3 My own forecast for the rest of the year is similar. Next year, though, I\nexpect growth to pick up to about 3 percent and then settle down to a long-term trend\nrate of about 2.7 percent in 2011.\nAlthough many forecasters now expect growth to improve, they also expect the\nunemployment rate to rise to near 10 percent at the end of this year or the beginning of\n2010. Actual numbers are trending in that direction. The unemployment rate climbed\nto 9.7 percent in August, even though nonfarm payroll jobs had the smallest decline so\nfar this year.\n\nSee the Third Quarter 2009 Survey of Professional Forecasters, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia.\n\n3\n\n\fI too anticipate that the unemployment rate will continue to creep up for a little while\nlonger. We will continue to hear about this as a concern in news reports in coming\nmonths. Yet, we know that the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator. We will see\nthe unemployment rate come down only well after the economy begins to recover.\nA key element of the improving outlook is the better news from the housing market.\nHousing sales and starts have generally shown improvement over the past six months,\nand even house prices appear to have bottomed out this summer.\nThe outlook for consumer spending is a mixed bag. The good news is that while the\n“cash for clunkers” effect on auto sales appeared to be significant, measures of\nconsumer spending that exclude automobiles and gasoline have stabilized and the\nprospects have improved somewhat. Nonetheless, there are reasons to remain\ncautious in one’s outlook: employment remains weak and housing values, while\nshowing some signs of life, remain well below their pre-crisis levels. On the other hand,\nincreases in equity values have helped restore some strength to household balance\nsheets.\nLooking at our region, the Philadelphia Fed’s Third District was once known for its\nmanufacturing sector, but its economy has become more diverse over the past 30 years.\nIn many ways, conditions here have been a good barometer for the national economy.\nFor example, one closely followed indicator for the region is our monthly Business\nOutlook Survey of current manufacturing activity. The encouraging news is that the\nsurvey’s general activity index has improved sharply in recent months. In September,\nthe index reported its second consecutive positive reading and, in fact, reached its\nhighest level since June 2007. 4\nIn addition, the manufacturers in our survey have become more optimistic about\nactivity over the next six months. The index of future activity has been near its five-year\npeak for the last three months. That doesn’t mean manufacturing activity will take off\nrapidly, but it does reflect a more positive outlook than we saw earlier in the year.\nSince our region often foreshadows national trends, it is not surprising that\nmanufacturing activity in the August report of the Institute for Supply Management\nimproved for the first time since January 2008. Its non-manufacturing activity index also\nimproved recently. In addition, industrial production for the nation increased in July for\nthe first time this year and then rose further in August. Our latest survey offers some\noptimism for continued improvement in the national numbers.\nThe Lehigh Valley has fared slightly better than the nation in some ways and worse in\nothers. For instance, the Lehigh Valley’s unemployment rate has not risen as sharply as\nthe nation’s and has remained below the national level in recent months. Since the\n4\n\nSee the September Business Outlook Survey, published by the Philadelphia Fed.\n\n\fpeak of the business cycle in December 2007, employment in the Lehigh Valley has\ndeclined 4.2 percent, compared to the national decline of 5 percent. The area has\nbenefited from a concentration of more stable education and health-care sector jobs\nand has lost a smaller percentage of construction jobs locally compared to the very large\ndecline nationally.\nThe housing sector, on the other hand, has fared somewhat worse here than in the\nnation. In the second quarter, for instance, house prices in the Lehigh Valley had fallen\n5.4 percent year-over-year, compared to a 4 percent decline nationally. The level of\nhouse prices is now back to the level we saw in 2005. As for housing permits, the\ndecline in the Lehigh Valley’s level of permits simply reversed the unusually rapid rise in\npermits in 2004. The current level of permits is now close to the pre-boom levels that\nprevailed at the beginning of this decade, whereas the national level of permits has\nfallen to the lowest levels recorded since the data began to be collected in 1960.\nLooking beyond the current recession, it seems likely that, in coming years, the Lehigh\nValley will once again see more in-migration of people from the neighboring states of\nNew Jersey and New York. Such in-migration has slowed substantially during the\ncurrent recession, as it did in the 2001 recession. Yet, the long-term demographic\ntrends seem to point to the region as an attractive area for people to locate.\nOutlook for Inflation\nThe outlook for inflation in the near term remains subdued, which is in line with the\nlatest Survey of Professional Forecasters. The survey’s forecasters were expecting that\nthe CPI would increase less than 1 percent over the four quarters of 2009. Long term,\nthe forecasters expect the average CPI inflation rate over the next 10 years to be 2.5\npercent — which is essentially the level they have been predicting for a number of\nyears.\nWhile I see little risk of inflation in the near term, I do see greater risk of higher inflation\nin the intermediate to long term for several reasons. First, monetary policy is extremely\naccommodative. We have expanded the Fed’s balance sheet to an unprecedented\ndegree since last fall and have kept interest rates at historically low levels. Second, I put\nless weight than many other economists do on the idea that economic slack or low\nresource utilization is a reliable predictor of inflation. 5\n\n5\n\nFor research on this subject, see Stephanie Schmitt-Grohe and Martin Uribe, “Optimal Simple and\nImplementable Monetary and Fiscal Rules,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 54, September 2007, pp.\n1702-25; Andrew Atkeson and Lee I. Ohanian, “Are Phillips Curves Useful for Forecasting Inflation?”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review, 25 (Winter 2001), pp. 2-11; Michael Dotsey and\nThomas Stark, “The Relationship Between Capacity Utilization and Inflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia Business Review, Second Quarter 2005, pp. 8-17; and Stephen G. Cecchetti, “Inflation\nIndicators and Inflation Policy,” NBER Macroeconomics Annual 1995, pp. 189-219.\n\n\fToday, I often hear some forecasters argue that inflation will remain low in the coming\nyears because the slack in the economy is not likely to disappear for some time. Yet,\nseveral empirical studies have shown that economic slack is difficult to measure with\nany accuracy. 6 It is particularly hard to measure slack near the turning points in\nbusiness cycles, so making policy decisions based on measures of such slack becomes\nproblematic.\nLafayette’s students did not experience the Great Inflation of the 1970s. But I did. Our\ncurrent circumstances pose an eerily similar set of conditions to those in the mid-1970s.\nThe nation had experienced a severe recession, in part due to a large oil-price shock.\nMany economists and Fed policymakers believed that a large amount of slack existed\nand it would help slow inflation and keep it low, even as the Fed undertook a rapid\nmonetary expansion to spur economic growth and lower the unemployment rate.\nUnfortunately, slack was poorly measured and turned out to be not as significant as first\nestimated. Thus, the Fed’s monetary expansion led to rising inflation for the balance of\nthe 1970s. One lesson learned during this episode is that inflation expectations can\nmatter a great deal, and if they become unanchored — that is, if the public comes to\nbelieve that the Fed will not do what is necessary to preserve price stability — then\ninflation can rise quickly regardless of the amount of so-called slack in the economy. The\nprice we paid to regain control of inflation and the Fed’s credibility to do so came in the\nform of the 1981-82 recession and was a steep one.\nConsequently, just as the Fed has taken aggressive steps in flooding the financial\nmarkets with liquidity during this crisis to reduce the possibility of a second Great\nDepression, it will also have to take the necessary steps to prevent a second Great\nInflation. Our credibility depends on it. As the economy and financial markets improve,\nthe Fed will need to exit from this period of extraordinarily low interest rates and large\namounts of liquidity. We recognize the costs that significantly higher inflation and the\nensuing loss of credibility will impose on the economy if we fail to act promptly, and\nperhaps aggressively, when the time comes to do so. The Fed will need courage\nbecause I believe we will need to act well before unemployment rates and other\nmeasures of resource utilization have returned to acceptable levels. The issues of when\nand the pace at which we unwind the extraordinary measures taken during the financial\ncrisis and recession are ones that are high on my list of priorities and are the subject of\nongoing discussions within the Fed.\n\n6\n\nSee Athanasios Orphanides and Simon van Norden, “The Unreliability of Output Gap Estimates in Real\nTime,” Review of Economics and Statistics, 84, November 2002, pp. 569-83. See also Susanto Basu and\nJohn Fernald, “What Do We Know and Not Know About Potential Output?” Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco, Working Paper Series 2009-05, March 2009.\n\n\fConclusion\nIn sum, the nation and the Federal Reserve have been facing some serious challenges.\nEven so, the economy and financial system have been showing signs of improvement in\nrecent months, and I expect the economy to be in much better shape a year from now.\nLafayette’s graduating Class of 2010 will not face as weak a job market as the Class of\n2009. When this year’s freshmen graduate in 2013 — the year that will mark the 100th\nanniversary of the Federal Reserve System — I expect the economy will be expanding at\na more normal pace and the unemployment rate will be substantially lower. Although\nthis year’s college freshmen were born during a recession and have entered college\nduring an even worse recession, let’s not forget that they also grew up during the\nlongest economic expansion in U.S. history — the 10-year expansion of the 1990s.\nWhat’s more, inflation over the first two decades of their lives has generally been far\nless volatile.\nIt is important that, even in times of recession, we continue to remind ourselves of the\nimportance of price stability. Since these freshmen are likely to have longer life spans\nthan those of us in the baby boom generation, keeping inflation low will be even more\nimportant to them as they move into the workforce and begin to earn a livelihood and\nsave for their own retirement years. For people who live 30 years after retiring and\nreach an age in the mid-90s, even an average inflation rate of 2.5 percent — which\nmany people might consider low today — will cut the purchasing power of their\nretirement dollar in half.\nTo keep inflation low, the central bank must have a strong commitment to the goal of\nprice stability. As I mentioned, research and history have shown that central banks that\ndo not have independence from short-term political influences in the conduct of\nmonetary policy tend to produce higher inflation rates and lower economic\nperformance. That is why I believe that, regardless of what types of financial reforms\nare adopted in the coming months, we must preserve the decentralized structure and\nindependence of the Federal Reserve System as an essential means of ensuring the\ninstitution’s credibility and commitment to its long-term objectives.\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fA Perspective on the Outlook, Output Gaps, and Price Stability\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nMoney Marketeers\nThe Down Town Association\nNew York, New York\nMay 21, 2009\n\nThank you for inviting me here tonight. The Money Marketeers has a long history as a public\nforum for the exchange of ideas, carrying on the work begun by former Fed official and NYU\nprofessor Dr. Marcus Nadler more than 80 years ago. Looking over the list of past speakers\nfrom near and far, I am honored to add my voice to this rich and distinguished tradition.\nTonight I want to discuss my near‐term economic outlook and, as I do so, suggest reasons why\npolicymakers and forecasters should be extremely cautious in relying on conventional measures\nof potential output and output gaps to restrain inflation. I will also suggest strategies for\nensuring that the Fed can achieve its price stability goal in a clear and transparent way.\nIn sharing these thoughts, let me emphasize that in formulating policies, it is valuable to hear\nperspectives on the economy and policy from throughout the country — not just from Wall\nStreet or Washington, but also from Philadelphia and from the other Districts of our uniquely\ndecentralized central bank. I think the diverse and independent voices that are represented in\nthe making of monetary policy result in a stronger and more effective institution and better\npolicies. As the famous American journalist Walter Lippmann once said: “Where all men think\nalike, no one thinks very much.”\nJust a few blocks from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, you can find the historic relics\nof the First Bank and Second Bank of the United States, which both failed to find the balance\nand independence necessary to function as the central bank of a vast and diverse new country.\nThat is why when President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law in 1913, it\nincluded an ingenious compromise proposed by President Wilson — a decentralized, central\nbanking system that has so far lasted 95 years and served our country well. Indeed, this insight\nwas not lost on the European Central Bank, whose structure was created with similar features.\nCongress created the Federal Reserve System with independent regional Reserve Banks and a\nBoard of Governors in Washington that provided checks and balances — checks and balances\nbetween centralization and decentralization, checks and balances between the public and\n\n1\n\n\fprivate sectors, and check and balances between Wall Street and Main Street — all to ensure\nthat policy decisions were balanced and independent.\nCongress also wanted a central bank accountable to Congress, yet not subject to undue political\ninfluences. That is why Congress chose to make the Fed independent from the Treasury\nDepartment and the administration; why Fed Governors have 14‐year terms; why the 12\nReserve Banks are structured more like banks than like government agencies; and why Reserve\nBank employees, officers, and directors are generally restricted from engaging in political\nactivities.\nAs the president of one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, I receive a lot of information\nabout business and financial conditions in the mid‐Atlantic region and even more broadly from\ncontacts in the national and international business communities. I use that information, along\nwith incoming data on the national economy, when I prepare for meetings of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee so that our nation’s monetary policy reflects the most up‐to‐date and\ncomprehensive picture of the economy. The information from the Reserve Bank Districts, in its\ndetail and timeliness, is often invaluable in understanding how our economy is evolving.\nOnce known for its heavy concentration in the manufacturing sector, Philadelphia’s Third\nDistrict has become much more diverse over the past 30 years. In some cases, conditions in the\nDistrict have foreshadowed national developments. For instance, the monthly general activity\nindex for manufacturing firms participating in the Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey\nbecame consistently negative at the beginning of 2008. As it turned out, in December 2008, the\nNBER announced that the current recession had started in December 2007.\nSo far in 2009, our District’s economy remains very weak. The negative levels of the Business\nOutlook Survey’s general activity index, as well as the declines in the monthly coincident\neconomic indexes for the 50 states published by our staff,1 are consistent with the large 6.1\npercent decline in real GDP in the first quarter, which nearly matches the decline in the fourth\nquarter of 2008.\nUnemployment rates in our region, although not as high as in the nation overall, have risen\nsharply in the past few months. Some areas in our District that in past recessions saw\nsubstantially lower unemployment rates than the rest of the nation are now seeing\nunemployment rates above 7 percent.\nEven so, both our District and the nation are beginning to see some signs that the severity of\nthe recession is beginning to wane. The Business Outlook Survey includes an index of future\ngeneral activity for six months ahead. That index has been positive for five consecutive months:\nit increased by more than 20 points in April and an additional 11 in May, to + 47.5, its highest\nlevel in more than four years.\n\n1\n\nSee the State Coincident Indexes published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\n2\n\n\fWhile we have not seen such encouraging signs in the national data on manufacturing, we have\nseen some signs of stabilization — or, dare I say it, the bottoming out — of the housing market.\nEven some measures of house prices are not falling as sharply now. We have begun to hear\nanecdotal stories of stabilization in some parts of our region’s housing sector as well. Another\nencouraging sign is that, at the national level, real consumer spending actually rose in the first\nquarter of this year, after falling sharply in the last half of 2008. Although April’s decline in\nretail sales is a little disappointing, on balance, the news so far this year about overall consumer\nspending has not been as bad as many expected. Moreover, we must anticipate some noise in\nmonthly data and some bumps or setbacks along the way as the economy moves from\ncontraction to expansion.\nThus, while forecasting in the current environment is tricky, many forecasters, myself included,\nexpect the second quarter of this year to exhibit a less severe decline in real GDP. Yet, I remain\nrelatively optimistic and expect positive but modest growth in the second half, making fourth‐\nquarter to fourth‐quarter real GDP growth only slightly negative for 2009.\nI am also relatively optimistic about growth next year. In fact, since January, I have not changed\nmy growth forecast for 2010 or 2011. I expect the recovery to gain traction in 2010, with\ngrowth picking up to about 3 percent and then settling down to its long‐run steady state of\nabout 2.7 percent in 2011.\nThe sharp rise in the unemployment rate in the first few months of 2009 and the steep declines\nin payroll employment have led me to revise upward my unemployment rate forecasts. I\nexpect the unemployment rate to peak sometime early next year above 9 percent, before\nfalling gradually. This is consistent with my growth projections, since we know that\nunemployment rates only recede with a significant lag after the economy begins to recover.\nThe broad outlines of this forecast are shaped by a view that the economy has suffered from a\nsignificant and persistent adverse shock to financial intermediation, manifesting itself in the\nform of the credit crisis. The consequences of this shock require significant real adjustments in\nthe economy. For example, we are undoubtedly seeing a shrinking of the financial and housing\nsectors, and resources, both labor and capital, should flow into other parts of the economy.\nWe cannot and we should not attempt to prevent these reallocations.\nThis suggests that the appropriate measure of the equilibrium level of national output is now\nlower than it had been previously. What’s more, this adverse shock is likely to persist for a\nwhile, and the necessary reallocations will take time to complete. Indeed, the economy’s\npotential output may be lower than previously estimated for some time. This means measures\nof the so‐called output gap, the difference between the level of actual and potential output,\nwill not be as high as they otherwise would be and may be volatile and hard to measure,\nespecially since potential output is inherently unobservable. This is an important point to which\nI will return shortly.\n\n3\n\n\fMy view of the economic outlook is also shaped in part by a forecasting model we are\ndeveloping at the Philadelphia Fed. This model is based on what has become the workhorse\nmodel of modern macroeconomics. One of its key features is that expectations of future\neconomic variables are forward‐looking.2 Interestingly, this type of model produces a forecast\nthat shows a significant recovery underway by the end of the year.\nWhile I see somewhat more economic growth over the next 12 to 18 months than some\nprivate‐sector forecasters, I also see less deflationary pressure in the near term than other\nforecasters, such as those in our latest Survey of Professional Forecasters.3 And I see greater\nrisk of higher inflation over the intermediate to longer term.\nI have several reasons for this view: First, monetary policy is extremely accommodative.\nSecond, as I just mentioned, my forecast relies more on forward‐looking expectations of\ninflation compared to the forecasts of many economic models, in which backward‐looking\nelements are more heavily weighted. This means that the very low levels of inflation resulting\nfrom the plunge in oil prices during the past year are not given as much weight in assessing\nwhether inflation will remain low in the future as in a model that depends less heavily on recent\npast inflation to determine inflation expectations. Third, I put less weight on output gaps or\nother measures of slack as predictors of inflation, which is consistent with both theory and\nempirical estimates from a variety of economic studies.4 And fourth, I am not convinced that\nthe size of the output gap is nearly as big as suggested by others for reasons I just discussed.5\nThese last two points seem particularly appropriate and consistent with work that\ndemonstrates the pitfalls of depending too much on measures of the output gap, which\nempirical studies have shown are not reliably measured in real time.6 Indeed, one study found\nthat ex post revisions of the output gap are of the same order of magnitude as the output gap\nitself — which means that a data revision could make an output gap disappear.7 Since it is\n2\n\nSee Frank Schorfheide, Keith Sill, and Maxym Kryshko, “DSGE Model‐Based Forecasting of Non‐Modeled\nVariables,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper No. 08‐17, September 8, 2008.\n3\nSee the second quarter 2009 release of the Survey of Professional Forecasters, published by the Federal Reserve\nBank of Philadelphia.\n4\nSee for example, Stephanie Schmitt‐Grohe and Martin Uribe, “Optimal Simple and Implementable Monetary and\nFiscal Rules,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 54, September 2007, pp. 1702‐25; Andrew Atkeson and Lee I.\nOhanian, “Are Phillips Curves Useful for Forecasting Inflation?” Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly\nReview, 25 (Winter 2001), pp. 2‐11; Michael Dotsey and Thomas Stark, “The Relationship Between Capacity\nUtilization and Inflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Business Review, Second Quarter 2005, pp. 8‐17;\nStephen G. Cecchetti, “Inflation Indicators and Inflation Policy,” NBER Macroeconomics Annual 1995, pp. 189‐219.\n5\nThis argument also applies if one prefers to think of an “unemployment gap” or some difference between the\ncurrent unemployment rate and a natural rate of unemployment rather than an output gap. It is likely that the\neconomic shock of the financial crisis has not only lowered potential output but also increased the natural rate of\nunemployment.\n6\nSee Athanasios Orphanides and Simon van Norden, “The Unreliability of Output Gap Estimates in Real Time,”\nReview of Economics and Statistics, 84, November 2002, pp. 569‐83. See also Susanto Basu and John Fernald,\n“What Do We Know and Not Know About Potential Output?” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Working\nPaper Series 2009‐05, March 2009.\n7\nSee Orphanides and van Norden (November 2002).\n\n4\n\n\fparticularly hard to measure the output gap near business cycle turning points, making policy\ndecisions based on measures of such gaps becomes problematical.\nOur experience in the 1970s provides a good case study illustrating the dangers of relying on\nperceived large output gaps to keep inflation low. The nation experienced a severe recession in\nthe mid‐1970s, in part due to a large oil‐price shock that forced significant reallocations in the\nreal economy. At the time, many economists and Fed policymakers believed that a large\noutput gap had emerged and would help slow inflation and keep it low, even as the Fed\nundertook a rapid monetary expansion to spur economic growth and lower the unemployment\nrate. Unfortunately, estimates of the output gap were poor and the gaps turned out to be\nmuch smaller than thought. Thus, the Fed’s monetary expansion led to rising inflation. The\nFed’s lack of a credible commitment to maintain price stability only exacerbated the problem.\nToday, I often hear forecasters argue that inflation will remain low in the coming years because\nof a large current output gap that is not likely to be closed for some time. But as I mentioned\nearlier, the large adverse productivity shock to financial intermediation means that equilibrium\noutput and estimates of potential output are now lower, so the output gap is not likely to be as\nbig as standard estimates suggest. If so, the economy may be at greater risk of inflation than\nthe conventional wisdom indicates. The current circumstances pose an eerily similar set of\nconditions to those in the mid‐1970s — we have rapid monetary expansion in the face of an\napparently substantial output gap. While inflation expectations appear to remain anchored, we\nshould not become sanguine about our credibility – it can be easily lost. I, for one, do not want\nto repeat the unpleasant experience of the late 1970s.\nThe theoretical and empirical evidence regarding the relevance of output gaps in modeling\ninflation should make us highly suspicious of inflation forecasts that depend heavily on\nmeasures of “gaps” and “slack.” Instead, if we look at inflation forecasts from a model that\nruns solely off historical correlations in the data and incorporates forward‐looking expectations,\nwe find inflation rising significantly over the forecast horizon. The model’s headline PCE\ninflation forecast rises above 3 percent in 2010 and exceeds 4 percent by 2012. Of course, I\nunderstand that the current episode may lie outside the historical norms. Nevertheless, we\nshould not disregard such historical evidence in assessing the overall outlook.\nThus, I believe there is a growing risk of higher inflation in the out years of the forecast. For\n2009, I am forecasting inflation near 1.2 percent. But it then rises over the forecast horizon to\n2.5 percent in 2011. I base this forecast on an assumption that, as financial market conditions\nimprove and the housing market stabilizes, the FOMC will contract its balance sheet and raise\nthe fed funds rate in a prompt and timely manner. Doing so will help keep inflation\nexpectations well anchored. My inflation forecast would show considerably more acceleration\nif I assumed that the FOMC would be slow to change its stance for monetary policy as financial\nmarkets return to operating more normally.\nWe must keep in mind that the failure to maintain well‐anchored inflation expectations can\nwreak havoc with the real economy, foster unnecessary volatility, and make it more difficult for\n5\n\n\fthe Fed to deliver on its mandate to keep the economy growing with maximum employment\nand price stability.\nHow can we ensure that the Federal Reserve can deliver on its responsibility to maintain price\nstability?\nFirst, I and other economists have long proposed establishing an explicit inflation target as a\nway to signal the FOMC’s commitment to price stability and to help anchor expectations.8 A\npublic commitment to a numerical inflation target over an intermediate horizon is a clear and\nfeasible goal for monetary policy and is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandates. Such\nan inflation target would not only help prevent inflation expectations from rising to undesirable\nlevels, but it would also help prevent expectations from falling to undesirable levels. It would\noffer greater clarity and transparency in communicating our monetary objectives for price\nstability and would give us a target that we could credibly commit to meet over time.\nYet I believe that there is more we should do to ensure sound monetary policy and price\nstability as we come out of this crisis.\nDuring this crisis, the Fed has expanded its role in the economy in extraordinary ways as it\nsought to contain the financial crisis and its effects on the economy. These actions have the\npotential of altering the delicate political balance of the institution, putting at risk its\nindependence and, in so doing, diminishing its credibility and ability to maintain price stability.\nIn an effort to promote financial stability, the Fed has strayed far into credit policies that\ndifferentially affect firms, asset classes, and sectors of the economy, which amounts to credit\nallocation. In my view, if the government engages in credit policies, doing so should be the\nresponsibility of the fiscal authority, not the central bank.\nThe Fed historically has engaged in credit policies through its discount window lending to\nfinancial institutions and as the lender of last resort. In the past, the amount of such lending\nhas been small and very temporary. That is no longer true. Through special purpose vehicles,\ndirect lending to nonfinancial institutions, and purchases of private asset‐backed securities, the\nFed’s credit policies now loom large on its balance sheet. This represents a mixing of monetary\nand fiscal policies to a degree not witnessed since before the famous Treasury‐Fed Accord of\n1951.\n8\n\nFor instance, see the speech by Frederic Mishkin, \"Whither Federal Reserve Communications?,\" at the Peterson\nInstitute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., July 28, 2008; or the speech by Ben Bernanke, \"A\nPerspective on Inflation Targeting,\" at the Annual Washington Policy Conference of the National Association of\nBusiness Economists. Washington, D.C., March 25, 2003. See also speeches by Charles I. Plosser, “Credibility and\nCommitment,” at the New York Association for Business Economics, March 6, 2007; “The Benefits of Sytematic\nMonetary Policy,” at the National Association for Business Economics, March 2, 2008; “The Economic Outlook and\nSome Challenges Facing the Federal Reserve,” at the 2009 Economic Outlook Panel, University of Delaware,\nJanuary 14, 2009; and “Ensuring Sound Monetary Policy in the Aftermath of Crisis,” at the U.S. Monetary Policy\nForum, New York, February 27, 2009.\n\n6\n\n\fA mixing of monetary policy and fiscal policy in the Fed’s actions increases the number of\nentities that might try to influence Fed decision‐making in their favor. Both economic theory\nand practice indicate that central banks should operate independently from such political\npressures and resist them when they arise, so that their policies benefit society at large over\nthe longer term and not any particular constituency in the near term.\nWe need to draw a bright line once again between monetary policy and fiscal policy. The\nrecent crisis has muddied that separation considerably and we must restore it. The Fed must\nnot be seen by the public or the Congress as a piggy bank that can substitute for difficult fiscal\npolicy decisions.\nWhen a nation’s treasury or finance ministry and its central bank work too closely together,\nthere is a clear risk that the government’s spending will end up being financed by the central\nbank’s power to create money and that the public will become confused as to their respective\nroles. History shows us that you can get very bad economic outcomes with rapidly rising\ninflation. Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation is the current extreme example of this. Independence is\nessential to central bank success and the Federal Reserve’s current governance and\ndecentralized structure has been an important contributor to ensuring that independence.\nWhen financial markets begin to operate normally and the outlook for the economy improves,\nthe Fed’s balance sheet must contract if it is to maintain price stability. Some of the new\nlending facilities will naturally unwind once they are terminated. Yet, some of the assets will\nnot go away so quickly. For example, the Fed has begun the process of purchasing more than\n$1 trillion in mortgage‐backed securities, many of which will not roll off the Fed’s balance sheet\nfor years unless the Fed sells them in the marketplace. We will need to have the fortitude to\nmake some difficult decisions when it is time for our policies to be reversed or unwound.\nAre there ways to improve the Fed’s ability to unwind these lending programs and shrink its\nbalance sheet when the time comes to do so? That is, is there a way to provide a clear exit\nstrategy for the Fed? Is there a way to ensure the Fed’s independence to fulfill its monetary\npolicy responsibilities and insulate it from demands to use its credit policies as a fiscal tool?\nI believe there is. This February I proposed that the Fed and Treasury agree to a new “accord.”9\nSpecifically, the Fed and the Treasury should reach an agreement whereby the Treasury takes\nall the non‐Treasury assets and non‐discount‐window loans from the Fed’s balance sheet in\nexchange for Treasury securities.10 Going forward, for non‐discount‐window lending, the\n9\n\nSee “Ensuring Sound Monetary Policy in the Aftermath of Crisis,” by Charles I. Plosser at the U.S. Monetary Policy\nForum, New York, New York, February 27, 2009.\n10\nFor a discussion of such an accord in a different context, see J. Alfred Broaddus, Jr. and Marvin Goodfriend’s\narticle, “What Assets Should the Federal Reserve Buy?” and Goodfriend’s article, “Why We Need an ‘Accord’ for\nFederal Reserve Credit Policy: A Note,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly (Winter 2001).\nSuch an accord would also be consistent with the recommendations made by the Group of Thirty’s Working Group\non Financial Reform about the role of central banks in providing financial stability. See “Financial Reform: A\nFramework for Financial Stability,” Group of Thirty, Washington, D.C. (2009).\n\n7\n\n\fFederal Reserve would follow what can be called a “Treasuries‐only policy.” If emergency\ncircumstances arise, the Treasury could request the Fed to purchase non‐Treasuries. The assets\nso acquired would promptly be exchanged for Treasury securities to preserve the central bank’s\nindependence and the control of its own balance sheet.\nThe principles underlying such an “accord” would offer a number of benefits.\nFirst, in the short run it would transfer funding for the current credit programs to the Treasury\n— which would issue Treasury securities to fund the programs. This would ensure that the Fed\ncould shrink its balance sheet with as little distortion as possible and help preserve its ability to\nconduct independent monetary policy. Second, such an accord would provide a clearer\nseparation between monetary and fiscal policy and ensure that credit policies that place\ntaxpayer funds at risk are appropriately under the oversight of the fiscal authority.\nFinally, the transparency of the Fed has received a great deal of attention in recent months. A\n“Treasuries‐only policy” would ensure greater transparency and clarity of the Fed’s operations\nand objectives and help insulate it from political pressures to use central bank credit policy to\nconduct fiscal policy. This would preserve the Fed’s independence to conduct sound monetary\npolicy.\nI welcomed the joint statement of the Treasury and the Fed on March 23, 2009. It\nacknowledged that in carrying out its lender of last resort responsibilities, the Fed should avoid\nboth taking credit risk and allocating credit to narrowly defined sectors or classes of borrowers.\nInstead, the Fed’s aim should be to improve financial or credit conditions broadly. The\nstatement said plainly that government decisions to influence the allocation of credit are the\nprovince of the fiscal authorities.11 This joint statement was a step in the right direction to\nensure the Fed’s effectiveness in carrying out monetary policy in the future. However, more is\nrequired to institutionalize these principles. The accord I have proposed would be an important\nsafeguard to an independent and effective monetary policy and would result in a more\ntransparent institution.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, I am optimistic that the economy and the financial system will recover. As my\ngrandmother used to tell all her children and grandchildren when times seemed difficult, “This\ntoo shall pass.” That does not mean the path to recovery will be smooth. There are plenty of\nopportunities for bumps and setbacks along the way. And even as the real economy begins to\ngrow, unemployment will not improve for a while and may worsen some more. This is to be\nexpected, since the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator of the state of the economy.\nI am also concerned that some forecasters and policymakers may be placing too great a\nreliance on flawed measures of potential output and output gaps to predict that inflation will\n11\n\nSee the joint statement issued by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, March 23, 2009.\n\n8\n\n\fremain subdued for many years even in the face of extraordinary monetary accommodation.\nThe consequence could be substantially higher inflation rates in the intermediate term unless\nthe monetary accommodation is removed sooner and faster than many anticipate. It is always\nbest not to repeat the mistakes of the past, whether it be those made in the Great Depression\nor the Great Inflation.\nFinally, we must be careful to ensure that, in responding to the crisis, we do not undercut the\nrole and independence of the Federal Reserve in a way that could undermine the Fed’s ability\nto achieve its dual mandate for price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth. To\nhelp ensure sound policy and anchor inflation expectations, the Fed should announce an\ninflation target. To help preserve the Fed’s independence as well as to ensure transparency\nand sound monetary policy, the Fed and the Treasury should agree to a new “accord” that\nclearly delineates the responsibilities of each institution, assigning credit policies to the\nTreasury and the independent conduct of monetary policy to the Federal Reserve.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fRedesigning Financial System Regulation\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nFor the New York University Conference\n“Restoring Financial Stability: How to Repair a Failed System”\nMarch 6, 2009\n\nIntroduction\nThe financial crisis has underscored the need to reform the regulatory and supervisory\narchitecture of our financial system. The importance of this undertaking, and doing it properly,\ncannot be overstated — nor should it be rushed. In general, I believe making major policy\nreforms in the “heat of battle” risks adopting policies that have unintended consequences. Such\n“quick fixes” may inadvertently hamper market competition or innovation and create conditions\nthat provide the foundation of the next crisis. Moreover, without careful analysis, hasty reform\nmay fail to address the heart of the problem. We must make sure that the major regulatory\nreforms we put into place will be as agile and dynamic as the financial system itself. The\nregulatory structure must foster financial stability without stifling financial innovation.\nNew York University’s collection of thoughtful white papers on restoring financial stability\ncovers many facets of regulatory redesign and makes an important contribution to the debate.\nToday, I would like to highlight three important considerations as we undertake the serious task\nof redesigning our financial regulatory structure. These involve addressing the too-big-to-fail and\ntoo-interconnected-to-fail issue; developing systematic and transparent regulatory approaches for\ndealing with firms that pose systemic risk; and addressing the Federal Reserve’s future role in\nensuring financial stability.\nAddressing the Problem of Too-Big-to-Fail and Too-Interconnected-to-Fail Institutions\nIn the current crisis, we have seen that financial firms that become too big or too interconnected\nto fail pose serious problems for financial stability and for regulators.1 Due to the complexity and\ninterconnectivity of today’s financial markets, the failure of a major counterparty has the potential\nto severely disrupt many other financial institutions, their customers, and other markets. We have\nalso seen that market discipline won’t work when creditors and counterparties believe they are\nnever at risk. The belief that regulators will bail out creditors of financial firms creates moral\nhazard that leads to poor risk-taking decisions and undermines the incentives for creditors to\nmonitor these firms. Moreover, it creates incentives for financial firms to become too large and\ntoo complex to fail in order to exploit the implicit government guarantees.\n\n1\n\nSee Stern and Feldman (2004) for discussion of the issues raised by financial firms being too big to fail.\n\n1\n\n\fDuring the past year, regulators were repeatedly confronted with the unpalatable choice of either\npermitting large financial firms to enter bankruptcy without an adequate resolution mechanism or\ntaking unprecedented actions to limit potential systemic risks. The financial problems at Bear\nStearns, AIG, and Lehman Brothers elicited different responses from government, which\ncontributed to uncertainty. Arguably, this uncertainty in itself became a source of systemic risk.\nTo mitigate these risks, we must find a credible way to resolve these uncertainties and eliminate\nthe need for ad hoc rescues by government agencies and the Fed in particular. One wrong-headed\napproach would be to erect a battery of new regulatory restrictions in an attempt to drive the\nprobability of failure to zero. Such an approach would generate large supervisory costs, stifle\ninnovation, and result in regulatory arbitrage as markets work to evade the regulations. This type\nof arbitrage was a contributor to the current financial crisis.\nInstead, we must recognize that failures are an inevitable consequence of a dynamic financial\nsystem. Reforms should seek to reduce the cost of failures of systemically important financial\nfirms, which would enable regulators to allow such firms to fail when appropriate. Market\nparticipants, believing such failures are possible, would exercise greater market discipline and\nhelp prevent financial firms from getting into trouble in the first place. An important step toward\nreducing the cost of financial firm failure is designing better bankruptcy procedures for financial\nfirms, with particular rules for firms with systemically important operations. Regulators already\nhave a procedure for systemically important commercial banks. The FDIC has the authority\nunder FDICIA (the FDIC Improvement Act) to resolve a large bank failure by operating a bridge\nbank for a limited time, thereby reducing disruptions to the financial system while resolving the\nbank’s problems. The bridge bank authority requires the FDIC to pursue the least cost resolution\nonce systemic risks have receded. This means that common shareholders lose their investments\nand haircuts are imposed on uninsured creditors.\nWe need to develop a similar resolution procedure for nonbank financial firms that are\nsystemically important. The existing bankruptcy law, which seeks to maximize the payoffs to the\nfirm’s creditors, makes no provisions for systemic considerations. Therefore, we need a\nresolution mechanism for financial firms that explicitly addresses the tradeoff between reducing\nfinancial disruptions and minimizing the costs to taxpayers.\nSuch a resolution mechanism would contain procedures for separating out the systemically\nimportant components of a financial firm. Of course, this would require regulators to identify\nthese segments ex ante, an undertaking that requires planning.\nThe mechanism should also include rules for determining the timing of payments for uninsured\ncounterparties and creditors of the systemically important segment. To reduce the potential for\nsystemic disruptions, the resolution mechanism should provide for speedier restructuring of\nclaims than is typical in bankruptcy. The restructuring rules should also be known to market\nparticipants to reduce uncertainty. Here, we might take another leaf from the FDIC’s playbook\nfor handling bank failures. The FDIC has often provided expedited payment for uninsured\ncreditors, in contrast to the automatic stay in regular bankruptcy. These payments, which involve\na haircut based on historical recoveries, mitigate the threat of a run, reduce the costs of failure for\nthe bank’s claimants, and impose market discipline.\nSeveral open questions remain in the design of an effective resolution mechanism for financial\nfirms. First, we must be more specific about what we mean by systemic risk. I believe this is\nharder than it sounds, but it has profound implications for the types of firms and activities that\nrequire oversight. Second, we must develop a systematic and dynamic way to determine which\n\n2\n\n\ffinancial firms are or will become systemically important. And third, since many of these firms\noperate globally, we must work with our global counterparts to ensure international coordination\nof our resolution mechanisms. While these international issues can become quite complex, they\nshould not stand in the way of developing an improved resolution mechanism for financial firms\nhere in the U.S.\nOf course there is another, perhaps oversimplified, solution to the too-big-to-fail problem and that\nis, if an institution is too big to fail — shrink it. Under this approach no firm would need to be\nsaved due to the systemic risks inherent in its scale of operations. Unfortunately, in the current\nenvironment, consolidation in the financial industry is moving things in the wrong direction, and\nimposing size limits on financial firms would sacrifice efficiencies of scale. A better solution is\nperhaps to increase the costs on firms that pose systemic risks so that they will choose to limit\nthese risks.\n\nReducing Uncertainty Through Prompt(er) Corrective Action\nAs I mentioned earlier, government policy actions during the past year have created some\nuncertainty about how nonbank financial failures would be handled, and arguably, this\nuncertainty contributed to the stress in the markets.\nI have long advocated the benefits of conducting policy in a systematic way.2 I believe this\napproach applies to both monetary policy and policy toward promoting financial stability. Being\nsystematic about when we intervene in financial markets, and in what way, will yield better\nregulatory outcomes by reducing uncertainty. Moreover, we must be credible and follow through\nonce the systematic policy is articulated. Otherwise, the benefits will not be realized.\nOne systematic approach would be to extend the philosophy behind the prompt corrective action\n(PCA) provisions of FDICIA for commercial banks to other kinds of identifiable, systemically\nimportant financial firms. These firms should be subjected to greater regulatory oversight in\ngeneral to reduce the probability of insolvency. But given the limits to regulators’ ability to\nforesee and control events, we must also design regulations and mechanisms that seek to enhance\nthe effectiveness of market discipline. We should also ensure that our regulatory interventions\nare as transparent and as systematic as possible, to help align market expectations with our\nactions and outcomes.\nAs before, the first step is to define, identify, and quantify systemic risk. Economists in academia\nand government have been working on practical methods for measuring systemic risk.3 Our goal\nshould not be to find one all-encompassing measure of systemic risk but to develop a menu of\nuseful indicators to guide regulators’ attention to evolving problems. Information from securities\nmarkets, such as correlations among spreads on credit default swaps, can be useful. Regulators\nmight expand the range of available market indicators by introducing new securities designed to\naggregate market estimates of systemic risks. For example, academics have proposed using\ncontingent capital securities4 or a market for insurance against capital impairment5 as possible\nsupplements to regular capital requirements. The market prices of these instruments might\nprovide regulators with useful signals of systemic stress.\n2\n\nPlosser (2008a, 2008b).\nAcharya, et al. (2009) reviews some of the literature.\n4\nSee Flannery (2005) and Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2008).\n5\nAcharya, et al. (2009).\n3\n\n3\n\n\fArmed with such signals, regulators would be able to react — indeed, should be required to react\n— in a more timely way to increased stress in markets or institutions, following guidelines similar\nto the PCA rules in FDICIA. Elevated indicators of systemic stress could first trigger enhanced\ninformation collection and regulatory scrutiny. Signs of further stress could lead to further\nregulatory actions such as increased premiums, increased regulatory capital, or perhaps\nrequirements to better insulate systemically important segments. In these ways, firms generating\nsystemic risk would be taxed for the externalities generated by their activities. As indicators of\nsystemic risk rose further, they might trigger recapitalizations, as in recent proposals in which\nbanks would be required to hold a certain amount of convertible debt that would be converted\ninto equity under well-specified conditions. This convertible debt could play an important role in\nfinancial firm resolutions by providing a quick, transparent method for recapitalization. The\npotential for conversion, which would dilute shareholder and creditor claims, should improve\nmarket discipline. Finally, serious danger signals would trigger planning for closure or some\nother resolution procedure.\nWhile the precise details require more study, I believe that these interventions should be as\ntransparent and public as possible. Interventions should be graduated based on observable\nindicators. Regulators might publicize the indicators they are monitoring. They might also\nconsider publishing a list of firms they view as containing systemically significant segments.\nThere is some risk to publicizing such a list, since conditions can change quickly. However, I\nthink the benefits might outweigh the costs, since market participants will form expectations\nabout which firms or portions of firms are systemically significant in any case.\nEnsuring Financial Stability and the Role of the Fed\nFinally, I would like to turn to the role of the Federal Reserve in supporting financial stability.\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke has suggested that the Federal Reserve have a formal mandate to\nregulate systemically important payments and settlement systems.6 This aim is consistent with\nthe Fed’s existing mandate under the Federal Reserve Act to ensure the integrity, efficiency, and\naccessibility of the payment system. It is also essential to reducing systemic risk. Of course, as I\nhave already mentioned, determining precisely which systems are systemically important and\nhow to regulate them requires careful consideration.\nOthers have suggested that the Fed become the grand overseer of the stability of the entire\nfinancial system. Here, I think we should proceed with great care. We must avoid giving the Fed\na mandate for financial or systemic stability that is too vague or too sweeping or that lacks clearly\ndefined principles. We must set objectives that are both feasible and clearly defined. Otherwise,\nover-promising puts at risk the credibility of the central bank and jeopardizes the Fed’s ability to\nmeet its other important objectives: price stability and sustainable economic growth. Instability\nin the general level of prices — whether inflation or deflation — is itself a significant source of\nfinancial instability. Consequently, we must make sure that in trying to cure one source of\nfinancial instability, we do not sow the seeds of another.\nConclusion\nThe financial crisis has underscored the need for reforming the regulatory and supervisory\narchitecture of our financial system. Today I’ve outlined three considerations as we pursue\nreform. First, we must address the too-big-to-fail and too-interconnected-to-fail issue by\n6\n\nBernanke (2008).\n\n4\n\n\fdeveloping a resolution mechanism that reduces the systemic costs of failure. Second, we must\ndevelop ways to measure systemic risk and impose higher regulatory burdens, in a systematic and\ntransparent way, on firms that generate increasing levels of systemic risk. Third, the Fed should\nplay a central role in reducing systemic risk through an explicit mandate to regulate systemically\nimportant payments and settlements systems. However, we should not ask the Fed to take on\nresponsibilities that would undercut its ability to achieve its monetary policy objectives.\nWe have the opportunity to design a robust and dynamic regulatory structure that balances the\nneed to reduce financial system instability with the need to preserve financial system innovation.\nThe importance of this undertaking cannot be overstated. The Federal Reserve has several\nworking groups looking carefully at financial system architecture and reform. The scholarship\nexhibited by the New York University researchers, others in academia, and the regulatory\nagencies provides useful information as we work toward meeting that goal.\n\n5\n\n\fReferences\nAcharya, Viral, Lasse Pedersen, Thomas Philippon, and Matthew Richardson. “Regulating\nSystemic Risk,” Chapter 13 in Viral Acharya and Matthew Richardson, eds., Restoring Financial\nStability: How to Repair a Failed System, New York: Wiley and Sons, 2009.\nBernanke, Ben.

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nThe Initiative on Global Markets\nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 27, 2009\n\nThe financial crisis and its ramifications for the broader economy have forced policymakers to be\naggressive and creative in their efforts to deal with unfolding events. In my remarks today,\nrather than review how policymakers got here, I’d like to discuss some of the issues raised by our\nchoices and suggest three ways to strengthen the Federal Reserve’s credibility and commitment\nto sound monetary policymaking going forward. 1\nWith December’s cut in the fed funds rate target to a range of 0 to 25 basis points, the Federal\nReserve’s monetary policy entered a new regime. The FOMC’s statement indicated that the\nfocus of policy will be to sustain the size of the Fed’s balance sheet at a high level.\nWhen the crisis began, the Fed responded by aggressively cutting the fed funds rate and by\nimplementing a number of lending facilities intended to provide liquidity to disrupted credit\nmarkets. At first, the Fed was able to offset or sterilize its lending through open market\noperations, thus there was no significant increase in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet or in the\namount of total central bank credit provided to the economy. As the turmoil in credit markets\ncontinued, we expanded the types of institutions that could access Fed lending and the types of\nassets we took onto our balance sheet. But the size of that lending soon made sterilization no\nlonger feasible. Since September 2008, the Fed has increased total market liquidity while\naltering the allocation of credit to particular markets. As a result, the Fed’s balance sheet has\nmore than doubled from just over $900 billion last September to almost $2 trillion in January\n2009. Moreover, we can expect further increases as we continue to purchase mortgage-backed\nsecurities and agency debt and as we implement the TALF, or Term Asset-Backed Securities\nLoan Facility.\nThis policy of quantitative easing has come into play because the nominal policy rate has\neffectively reached zero and further accommodation seems desirable. By expanding the quantity\nof bank reserves beyond that needed to keep the funds rate at zero, this policy is meant to support\nthe economy. The policy also serves to prevent fears of deflation from turning into expectations\nof persistent deflation that would cause the real federal funds rate to rise. However, instead of\n1\n\nSee Charles Plosser, “Credibility and Commitment,” speech given to the New York Association for Business\nEconomics, New York, NY, March 6, 2007.\n\n1\n\n\fimplementing the balance-sheet expansion by purchasing government securities, the asset\ntypically found on the central bank’s balance sheet, the Federal Reserve has taken on a wide\narray of nontraditional assets — dramatically altering the composition of its balance sheet.\nChairman Bernanke has called this “credit easing” to distinguish it from other forms of\n“quantitative easing.” 2\nThe rationale for credit easing in particular markets, rather than more traditional quantitative\neasing achieved by the acquisition of more market-neutral Treasuries, is that intermediation in a\nnumber of credit markets has been disrupted, and the Fed has decided to take an active role in\nefforts to improve that intermediation. The jury is still out, however, as to how effective these\npolicies will be.\nBut there is no doubt that the current framework for monetary policy and its reliance on targeted\ncredit programs have carried the Federal Reserve into uncharted territory and poses some\nchallenges for policy going forward. Today I would like to suggest three steps we can take now\nto strengthen the Fed’s credibility and commitment to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability\nand sustainable economic growth. I believe these steps can better position us when the time\ncomes to resume more traditional monetary policy.\nThe first step is to reinforce our commitment to providing a nominal anchor for our economy. It\nis essential to do so if we are to achieve the most unique of all our objectives — price stability.\nWith the fed funds rate essentially at zero, and our focus on credit easing, we are allowing our\nbalance sheet to grow, or shrink, based on criteria entirely unrelated to providing that nominal\nanchor. It is difficult to make credible commitments to price stability when the implementation\nof policy is disconnected from such an important policy objective.\nFortunately, I believe there is a way out of this dilemma: the Fed should adopt an explicit\ninflation objective and publicly commit to achieving that objective over some intermediate\nhorizon. To me, the exact number or price index for the objective is somewhat less important\nthan the public commitment to a goal. Such a commitment would help anchor expectations more\nfirmly and diminish concerns of persistent inflation or persistent deflation — not an\ninconsequential issue in the current environment.\nIn addition to announcing an inflation objective, we must also clearly communicate our policy\nstrategy to the public so that they understand how the FOMC anticipates achieving that goal.\nThere are different ways to accomplish this. For example, Taylor-like rules that involve adjusting\nthe federal funds rate in response to deviations of inflation from target and shocks to output or\neconomic growth have some advantages. Such simple rules can be useful guides for conducting\n\n2\n\nA recent example of “quantitative easing” occurred in Japan between March 2001 and March 2006. Even before\nthat, the Bank of Japan had entered a period of low interest rates, lowering its policy rate to zero in February 1999.\nBetween February 1999 and March 2001, total assets on the Bank of Japan’s balance sheet grew by almost 40\npercent, from 80 trillion yen to 110 trillion yen. In the five-year quantitative easing period, total assets expanded by\nanother 40 percent, to a peak of 155 trillion yen in December 2005. Thus, it took over five years for the Bank of\nJapan to double its balance sheet. In contrast, the Fed doubled its balance sheet in about four months. Like the Fed,\nthe Bank of Japan also bought more than just government securities. It purchased both asset-backed securities and\nequities from commercial banks.\n\n2\n\n\fsystematic policy and can help effectively communicate to the public the conditional nature of\npolicy choices. 3\nAnother advantage of such transparent and simple rules is that if the FOMC chooses to deviate\nfrom what reasonable guidelines would suggest, then the Committee would, and should, feel\ncompelled to explain its reasoning, which would further improve the transparency of policy.\nAnother form of communication that could be useful is for the FOMC to publish quarterly\nprojections of the range and central tendencies of the Committee members’ assumed path of\npolicy over the forecast horizon that they believe is consistent with achieving our dual mandate\nof price stability and sustainable growth. Some see a risk that the public may perceive these\nprojections as a commitment to a particular path for policy. But the experiences of the central\nbanks of Sweden, Norway, and New Zealand, which publish policy path projections, suggest that\nthis risk can be overcome through careful communication.\nThe second step toward strengthening the credibility of our commitment to sound monetary\npolicy is to clarify the criteria under which we choose to step in as a lender of last resort. We\nmust spell out when we will intervene in markets or extend unusual credit to firms — and then\nwe must be willing to stick to those criteria. Moreover, we also need to complement such clear\ncommitment with a well-articulated exit strategy from such liquidity or credit programs.\nOur lending programs were created for extraordinary times and involve significant intervention\nin the private markets, but they run contrary to a long-standing and sound Fed practice of trying\nto minimize the effect of its actions on the allocation of credit across market segments. In my\nview, such programs are not, and should not, be part of the normal operation of a central bank.\nThe lack of clear ground rules for such intervention can lead market participants to speculate on\nthe next facility the central bank will create or on the next asset class or firm it will rescue. Such\nspeculation increases volatility and places other markets under stress. This is counter-productive\nto the programs’ stated objective of financial stability. Moreover, each intervention creates moral\nhazard that may lead market participants to take on more risk than they otherwise would — thus\nsowing the seeds for the next crisis.\nThe lack of a clearly communicated exit strategy also creates uncertainty in the very markets we\nare serving with these facilities and also may prove counter-productive to achieving the stability\nobjectives. For example, the central bank’s willingness to participate and to lend “cheaply” in\nselected markets may deter private-sector participants from returning to and restoring normal\nmarket functioning. Thus, an exit strategy might involve gradually raising the costs of using the\nfacilities, which may encourage the markets to heal themselves. A clear exit strategy would also\nenhance the Fed’s credibility if the public understood that it does, in fact, have a plan to exit\nfrom these unusual interventions.\nMy third and final suggestion is to draw a clearer distinction between monetary policy and fiscal\npolicy and to ensure that the Federal Reserve retains its independence to conduct sound monetary\npolicy.\n\n3\n\nSee Charles Plosser, “The Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy,” speech given to the National Association for\nBusiness Economics, Washington Economic Policy Conference, Washington, D.C., March 3, 2008.\n\n3\n\n\fThis suggestion is motivated by the fact that the current crisis and the Fed’s interventions have\ndramatically altered the composition of the assets on our balance sheet and created confusion in\nthe minds of many as to the respective roles of the central bank and the fiscal authority. These\ninterventions and ensuing confusion have ramifications for our independence and for the conduct\nof monetary policy.\nEventually economic conditions will improve, demand for excess reserves will fall, and in order\nto maintain price stability, the Fed will have to begin withdrawing the extraordinarily large\nsupply of liquidity with which it has flooded the market. Under normal operating procedures, this\nisn’t a problem, as the Fed holdings are mainly short-term Treasuries, which can be liquidated to\nreduce reserves and increase interest rates.\nHowever, under current circumstances, the Fed has substituted less liquid assets for Treasuries.\nIt is true that a number of the Fed’s new programs will unwind naturally and fairly quickly as\nthey are terminated because they involve primarily short-term assets. Yet we must anticipate\nthat special interests and political pressures may make it harder to terminate these programs in a\ntimely manner, thus making it difficult to shrink our balance sheet when the time comes.\nMoreover, some of these programs involve longer-term assets — like the agency MBS. Such\nassets may prove difficult to sell for an extended period of time if markets are viewed as\n“fragile” or specific interest groups are strongly opposed, which could prove very damaging to\nour longer-term objective of price stability. Thus, we must ensure that our current credit policies\ndo not constrain our ability to conduct appropriate monetary policy in the future.\nEven more important, credit allocation decisions, in my view, should be under the purview of the\nfiscal authority, not the monetary authority, since they involve using the public’s money to affect\nthe allocation of resources. The mixing of monetary policy and fiscal policy increases the\nnumber of entities that might try to influence Fed decision-making in their favor. Both economic\ntheory and practice indicate that central banks should operate independently from such pressures\nand resist them when they arise so that their policies benefit society at large over the longer term\nand not any particular constituency in the near term.\nSo where should we go from here? One suggestion that would promote a clearer distinction\nbetween monetary policy and fiscal policy and help to safeguard the Fed’s independence would\nbe for the Fed and Treasury to reach an agreement whereby the Treasury takes the non-Treasury\nassets and non-discount window loans from the Fed’s balance sheet in exchange for Treasury\nsecurities. Such an accord would offer a number of benefits. 4 First, it would transfer funding\nfor the credit programs to the Treasury — which would issue Treasury securities to fund the\nprograms — thus ensuring that credit policies that place taxpayer funds at risk are under the\noversight of the fiscal authority. Second, it would return control of the Fed’s balance sheet to the\nFed, so that we can continue to conduct independent monetary policy. Going forward, an\nagreement with Treasury would also state that if the fiscal authority at some point wanted the\n4\n\nFor a discussion of such an accord in a different context, see J. Alfred Broaddus, Jr. and Marvin Goodfriend’s\narticle, “What Assets Should the Federal Reserve Buy?” and Goodfriend’s article, “Why We Need an ‘Accord’ for\nFederal Reserve Credit Policy: A Note,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly (Winter 2001).\nSuch an accord would also be consistent with the recommendations made by the Group of Thirty’s Working Group\non Financial Reform about the role of central banks in providing financial stability. See “Financial Reform: A\nFramework for Financial Stability,” Group of Thirty, Washington, D.C. (2009).\n\n4\n\n\fcentral bank to engage in lending outside its normal operations and, importantly, should the Fed\ndetermine “unusual and exigent circumstances” warranted such action, then any accumulation of\nnontraditional assets by the Fed would be exchanged for government securities. This would\npreserve the Fed’s independence to control its balance sheet and ensure that the full authority and\nresponsibility for fiscal matters remained with the Treasury and Congress, where it rightfully\nbelongs.\nThere is a historical precedent for such an accord. In 1951, the Treasury and the Fed struck an\naccord that freed the Fed from pegging the interest rate on long-term Treasury debt below 2.5\npercent, which the Fed had done during and after World War II. 5 By pegging long rates below\n2.5 percent, the Fed was committing to add reserves to the banking system when market interest\nrates began to rise without regard to its inflation goal. This inability to control its own balance\nsheet was a fundamental problem for the credibility of the Fed in achieving its dual mandate.\nAfter considerable negotiations, the Treasury and the Fed reached an accord that freed the Fed to\nset interest rates consistent with its long-term goals. This allowed the Fed to re-establish its\nindependence and to conduct monetary policy in accordance with its dual mandate.\nToday, an accord to substitute Treasuries for non-Treasury debt on our balance sheet would\nsimilarly help ensure that the Fed will be able to implement its policy decisions. After all, the\ntime will come when the Fed will want to begin raising interest rates to achieve its goals. With\nTreasuries back on the balance sheet, the Fed will be able to drain reserves in a timely fashion\nwith minimal concerns about disrupting particular credit allocations or the pressures from special\ninterests.\nIt is always tempting to make policy based on short-term concerns and argue that we will worry\nabout other things later. Yet, actions we take today have consequences for the choices we face in\nthe future. We must recognize those consequences and take steps that ensure the effectiveness of\nfuture policy. Economics has shown that credible and committed policymaking yields better\noutcomes for the economy at large. By appropriately anticipating the longer-term consequences\nof our actions today, we can take steps that can ensure the Federal Reserve maintains and\nenhances its credibility as well as the ability to achieve its longer term objectives.\nSince we celebrated Abraham Lincoln’s birthday this month, I would like to close with a quote\nfrom our 16th president that seems particularly apropos to my discussion today: “You cannot\nescape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.”\n\n5\n\nFor several articles about the 1951 Accord, see the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s Economic Quarterly\n(Winter 2001).\n\n5\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nThe Federal Reserve has been a busy place during the past 18 months. In the face of a\ndeteriorating economy and a growing financial crisis, the Fed has undertaken a number of\nextraordinary actions. We have aggressively eased monetary policy by reducing the\ntarget federal funds rate by 500 basis points, so that it is now trading in a narrow range\nclose to zero. We’ve also put into place a number of lending facilities intended to\nprovide liquidity and credit to an economy threatened by frozen financial markets and a\nmajor contraction in lending.\nThese actions have been creative. Yet, they are not without risks, and they pose a\nnumber of challenges for the Federal Reserve. Today, I will briefly review my outlook\nfor the economy. I then want to discuss some of the difficulties in conducting monetary\npolicy when the target fed funds rate is near zero and some of the challenges created by\nour lending facilities. Such challenges underscore the potential risks to our central bank’s\nindependence, which has served the U.S. economy very well, and the need for a wellarticulated exit strategy from these various facilities when the time comes.\nLet me begin with my views on the economic outlook.\nEconomic Outlook\nEconomic growth has slowed significantly since last summer. Data released during the\nfinal months of 2008 became more and more discouraging. Consumer confidence fell to\nrecord lows, and many retailers became convinced the Grinch did indeed steal Christmas.\nReal GDP growth declined slightly in the third quarter, but it is likely to record a much\nsharper decline in the fourth quarter. The first half of 2009 is not likely to be much\nbetter. I don’t expect to see a turnaround until the second half of the year. Overall\ngrowth for 2009 (fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter) is likely to be well below 2 percent\nafter negative growth in 2008. Given this forecast, the current recession could well be\none of the longest in the post-World War II era.\n\n\f2\nDespite its length, though, I don’t expect this recession to necessarily rival the deep\nrecession in the early 1980s in terms of unemployment. In the early 1980s, the\nunemployment rate rose above 10.5 percent. I do not expect the unemployment rate to\nstray into double digits during this recession. Yet, I also don’t expect it to begin coming\ndown soon. Keep in mind that unemployment is a lagging indicator. It will not begin to\ncome down until after the economy is well on its way to recovery.\nI expect the housing sector will finally hit bottom in 2009 and the financial markets will\ngradually return to some semblance of normalcy. So my forecast sees the economy\nstarting to slowly recover in the second half of 2009 and building up more momentum in\n2010.\nAs for inflation, the declines in energy and commodity prices in recent months have\nsubstantially lowered the year-over-year increases in the headline consumer price index.\nEven excluding food and energy prices, inflation has moderated in recent months. As a\nresult, expectations of inflation for this year and next have also moderated. My own\nprojection is for inflation — both headline and core — to be below 2 percent for the next\nyear.\nForecasting is difficult even in the best of times, and the current environment is fraught\nwith much more than the usual challenges. So be warned: a great deal of uncertainty\nsurrounds any forecast today.\nChallenges Facing the Federal Reserve\nThe unprecedented actions the Fed has taken to help stabilize the economy and financial\nmarkets, including lowering the fed funds rate target to near zero and establishing a series\nof new lending facilities, create risks and their own set of policy challenges for us going\nforward.\nPerhaps the best way to understand these complexities is to understand how the Fed\ntypically makes funds available to the banking system. In normal times, the Fed expands\nor contracts its balance sheet through the purchase or sale of Treasury securities. Such\nactions increase or decrease our asset holdings in the form of government securities and\nincrease or decrease our liabilities in the form of bank reserves. This is the standard\nmechanism through which the Fed expands money in circulation.\nHowever, since early 2008 the Fed has introduced a number of new lending facilities.\nInstead of buying Treasuries, the Fed has been lending to a wide array of primarily\nfinancial institutions in an effort to make credit markets function more effectively. Until\nSeptember, most of that lending was offset — or, as economists say, sterilized — on our\nbalance sheet through the sale of other assets, mostly Treasuries. However, with the\nloans to AIG, the assistance to money market mutual funds, and the purchases of\ncommercial paper and other such interventions, we were no longer able to sell securities\nin sufficient quantities to prevent a substantial increase in our assets, which had the effect\nof adding very large quantities of reserves or new money to the banking system. As a\n\n\f3\nresult, the balance sheet has grown from just over $900 billion in early September to over\n$2.2 trillion at the end of the year. The Fed has already announced plans for additional\nprograms that are likely to further expand our balance sheet in 2009.\nMonetary Policy near the Zero Lower Bound\nLet me first discuss monetary policy in this new environment.\nBefore joining the Federal Reserve and since then, I have repeatedly stressed that the\nprimary responsibility of the central bank and monetary policy must be to ensure price\nstability. This means the Fed should seek to deliver a low and stable rate of inflation over\nthe intermediate term. Only the central bank can ensure price stability, so this goal\nwarrants our considerable attention and effort. Let me stress that price stability does not\njust mean avoiding unusually high inflation. It also means avoiding excessively low rates\nof inflation or deflation that may be inconsistent with price stability.\nOur attention to price stability, however, does not mean that monetary policy should be\nindifferent or unresponsive to economic conditions. Indeed, monetary policy should be\nmanaged in a way that yields the best economic outcome given the environment at the\ntime. As long as inflation and inflation expectations are well-anchored at a level\nconsistent with price stability, the target federal funds rate should fall with market rates\nwhen the economy weakens, and increase as market rates rise when the economy\nstrengthens.\nThe severity of the economic downturn and the financial crisis in 2008 called for\nunusually low inflation-adjusted, or real, interest rates, which led the FOMC to cut its\ntarget very aggressively. Nominal interest rates, however, cannot fall below zero, and\nthis fact can pose a problem for monetary policy. For example, if the economy is weak\nand nominal interest rates are at or near zero, then a fall in inflation expectations can lead\nto an increase in real interest rates. This increase would be contrary to what optimal\npolicy would suggest and this is what economists call the zero lower bound problem.\nA credible commitment to price stability — that is, low and stable inflation — is critical\nto anchoring these expectations about the future course of inflation and thus an essential\nelement of any sound monetary policy. Last spring and summer, there was great concern\nthat rising headline inflation rates, due to rapid and dramatic increases in the prices of oil\nand other commodities, would lead to rising inflation expectations, which in turn would\ncontribute to a more persistent rise in inflation rates. That is why I and other FOMC\nmembers continued to remind the public that the FOMC was committed to maintaining\nprice stability and would resist any unanchoring of inflation expectations.\nBy like token, significant declines in oil prices and other commodities have recently led\nto declines in the consumer price index, prompting some commentators to suggest that\nthe U.S. is facing a threat of persistent deflation, as it did in the Great Depression or as\nJapan faced in the 1990s.\n\n\f4\nI am not particularly concerned about the possibility of persistent deflation. When oil\nand commodity prices stabilize, the negative rates of inflation we have seen in the CPI\nare likely to disappear. Moreover, I am confident that the FOMC is committed to\nmaintaining price stability. Nonetheless, we must act to ensure that expectations of\ndeflation do not take root, just as we must act to ensure that expectations of higher\ninflation do not emerge. The failure to maintain well-anchored inflation expectations can\nwreak havoc with the real economy, foster unnecessary volatility, and make it more\ndifficult for the Fed to deliver on its dual mandate to keep the economy growing with\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nI and others have long proposed establishing an explicit inflation target as one way to\nsignal the FOMC’s commitment to price stability and help anchor expectations. Such a\ncommitment not only helps prevent inflation expectations from rising to undesirable\nlevels, but it can also help prevent expectations from falling to undesirable levels.\nAs most of you know, the federal funds rate target has been the traditional instrument of\nmonetary policy and is widely used to interpret the stance of policy. However, with the\ntarget funds rate at essentially zero, we must consider alternative mechanisms for\nconducting policy and ensuring we meet our objectives.\nThe FOMC has stressed that it will use the Fed’s balance sheet, broadly defined, to\nensure that monetary policy provides ample liquidity to the economy and to ensure\ndeflation does not become a problem. Consistent with this, as I have noted, the Fed’s\nbalance sheet has more than doubled in the last few months and narrow measures of\nmoney, such as the monetary base, have expanded dramatically. The Committee pointed\nout that the attention of policy at this point is not, however, on the traditional quantitative\nmeasures of money, but on the asset side of the balance sheet and the credit the Fed is\nproviding through its unprecedented lending programs.\nSince we are in uncharted territory, I believe we must proceed with caution. While the\nlending programs are designed to improve the flow of credit, they are currently injecting\nenormous amounts of liquidity into the system. I believe we need to monitor that\nliquidity and its composition closely so that we are able to withdraw it when the time\ncomes or else we risk fueling inflation in the future. Thus, it is not appropriate to ignore\nquantitative metrics in this new policy environment.\nWe must remember that to successfully deliver on its goal of price stability, monetary\npolicy must establish a nominal anchor for the economy. In practice, that anchor can be\nthe path of either a nominal interest rate or a nominal quantity of some measure of\nmoney.\nIn the current environment, with the targeted funds rate effectively at zero, it cannot serve\nas a nominal anchor. On the other hand, quantitative measures — such as the stock of\nmoney, reserves, or the monetary base — have a long and venerable tradition in monetary\ntheory and policy. Indeed, many countries have used quantitative targets quite\nsuccessfully over the years, including Germany and Switzerland. However, these metrics\n\n\f5\ndo not assess the distribution of Federal Reserve assets across its lending programs, a\nfocus of credit policy.\nNonetheless, while traditional measures of money may not be the best metrics for policy\nin this zero interest rate environment, the size of the balance sheet does offer a possible\nnominal anchor for monitoring the volume of our liquidity provisions. While attention is\ncurrently focused on credit policy, ignoring or failing to take into account the\nconsequences of unconstrained growth in our balance sheet could be costly down the\nroad in terms of our ability to ensure price stability or support a credible commitment to\nthat goal.\nHow we calibrate or decide the appropriate scale and composition of our balance sheet\nremains an open question that we must address and then communicate to the public. In\naddressing such concerns, we must ensure that our overall balance sheet’s size and\nevolution are consistent with our responsibility to promote price stability. Credit policy\nalone is not sufficient to ensure sound monetary policy.\nLending Facilities, Moral Hazard, and Exit Strategies\nIn addition to the challenge of implementing monetary policy when nominal rates are at\nzero, the lending facilities themselves pose a number of problems that the Fed must\nconfront.\nAs I have mentioned, the lending programs have dramatically altered the types of assets\non our balance sheet as well as its size. We must consider how we will shrink our\nbalance sheet when the time comes — as it surely will.\nWhen financial markets begin to operate normally and the outlook for the economy\nimproves, real market interest rates will again tend to rise. At that point, the demand for\nexcess reserves will fall, and our balance sheet must contract if we are to maintain price\nstability. Some of the new facilities will naturally unwind in a gradual manner once they\nare terminated. For example, the commercial paper lending facility only purchases\ncommercial paper of 90 days or less. Once we stop new purchases, those assets will\nmature and begin to shrink our balance sheet.\nYet some of the assets will not go away so quickly. For example, we are in the process\nof purchasing $500 billion of mortgage-backed securities, which will not roll off our\nbalance sheet for many years unless we consciously sell them in the marketplace. We are\nabout to embark on the purchase of nearly $200 billion of asset-backed securities whose\nmaturity will be about three years. Will we face challenges when we attempt to liquidate\nthese longer-term assets from our portfolio? Will there be pressure from various interest\ngroups to retain certain assets? Will there be pressure to extend some of these programs\nby observers who feel terminating the programs might disrupt “fragile” markets or that\nthe economy’s “headwinds” are too strong? Such pressures could threaten the Fed’s\nindependence to control its balance sheet and monetary policy. We will need to have the\n\n\f6\nfortitude to make some difficult decisions about when our policies must be reversed or\nunwound.\nBeyond monetary policy, the Fed’s recent lending presents other challenges. The growth\nin Fed lending and its unusual form are intended to reduce interest rate spreads in key\ncredit markets. To the extent that these elevated spreads signal a lack of liquidity, the\nFed’s actions as lender of last resort should help reduce spreads.\nHowever, if the widening of these spreads reflects counterparty risk that investors are\npricing into the marketplace, expanding liquidity may not be effective in narrowing these\nspreads, even when trading volumes increase. Indeed, in some markets, despite the\nongoing efforts of the Fed’s lending programs, large credit spreads have persisted. So,\nwe will need to continue to monitor these markets and be cautious in expanding our\nbalance sheet, since neither liquidity nor credit policy can solve the problem of\ncounterparty risk.\nFinally, we must create an exit strategy from these various facilities. They were created\nfor extraordinary times and involve significant intervention in the credit markets. They\nare not part of the normal operation of a central bank and should not be expected to\ncontinue.\nAs I have indicated, some of our new lending facilities were created to replace impaired\nor poorly functioning private credit markets. We must consider the possibility that our\npresence in these credit markets will deter private-sector participants from returning to\nand restoring these markets. To prevent our policies from having these perverse effects,\nwe should consider a gradual increase in the cost of borrowing from these facilities to\ndiscourage their use and encourage other participants to return to these markets. This\nshould be an important element of our exit strategy.\nUnfortunately, simply terminating the special lending programs is not enough to avoid\nsome knotty problems. The mere act of creating the programs has created moral hazard.\nTo the extent that market participants now feel more comfortable asking for the central\nbank’s support when they get into trouble, they may be inclined to take on more risk than\nwould otherwise be prudent — thus sowing the seeds for the next crisis. In exiting such\nprograms, it will be important for the Fed to develop clear objectives and boundaries for\nlending that we can commit to follow in the future. Clarifying the criteria under which\nwe will intervene in markets or extend credit, including defining what constitutes the\n“unusual and exigent” circumstances that form the legal basis for the Fed’s nontraditional lending, will be essential if we are to mitigate the moral hazard we have\ncreated.\nIn general, our aggressive lending, while intended to help the economy and financial\nmarkets recover, poses its own set of challenges. We must develop a well-articulated exit\nstrategy if we are to maintain control of monetary policy and encourage the revival of\nstrong and disciplined credit markets.\n\n\f7\nConclusion\nTo sum up, 2009 will be a challenging year for the U.S. economy and for policymakers.\nThe Fed has taken extraordinary actions in both monetary policy and its lending\noperations to address the deteriorating economic outlook and the ongoing stresses in\nfinancial markets. This is new territory for our central bank and raises a number of\nchallenges, some of which I have touched on today.\nI have stressed that operating with the target federal funds rate near zero and using the\nFed’s lending programs to implement policy pose some challenges for policymakers.\nWithout the target funds rate as a nominal anchor, it will be important for us to develop\nrelevant quantitative measures to assess the appropriate size and composition of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet.\nWe also must develop appropriate strategies for our lending programs to ensure that the\neconomic and financial market stability we have fought so hard to obtain remains in place\nin the future. In my mind, that means more than just maintaining control of our balance\nsheet and the volume of liquidity we inject into the economy. It also means designing\nexit strategies that will allow us to end these lending programs and drain that liquidity in\na timely manner. What’s more, it means that we must clearly articulate the boundaries of\nfuture lending to reduce the moral hazard we have created.\nOne thing that remains constant is the importance of anchoring expectations about\ninflation. The central bank’s price stability objective is just as critical to the effective\nfunctioning of the economy and financial system in the midst of this crisis as it was\nbefore this crisis began. Inflation targeting can help central banks signal their\ncommitment to low and stable inflation and thus help prevent expectations from drifting\ntoo high or too low. Ultimately, we must act in a way that is consistent with our price\nstability objective, for that is the key to our ability to deliver on our dual mandate.\n\n\f"

Simon Graduate School of Business\nUniversity of Rochester\n30th Annual Economic Outlook Seminar\nDecember 2, 2008\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon. I am very pleased to see so many familiar faces and old friends here in\nRochester and to participate in the 30th Annual Economic Outlook Seminar. I left\nRochester just over two years ago in the summer of 2006. While at that time the housing\nmarket had begun to slow, no one imagined the economic turmoil that has since ensued.\nThere was no one cause of that turmoil. Rather, we need to look to several factors —\nconditions akin to a “perfect storm” — which led to the financial tsunami we’ve\nexperienced for more than a year. The tidal wave that has roiled the economy began with\na sustained decline in housing after a decade-long boom. Yet, more than a reversal in\nhousing was needed to cause our current problems.\nThe innovations in lending that made subprime mortgages possible in the 1990s\nsucceeded in expanding homeownership to millions of families. These products proved\nboth successful and profitable through 2006. This success, however, led to lending terms\nthat were highly dependent on rising house prices. Many lenders began to offer products\nwith little or no down payment to even the riskiest borrowers and, at times, at very low\nteaser rates. Many borrowers were speculators, who expected to ride the wave of higher\nhome values until they resold. Others expected to refinance their mortgages when teaser\nrates expired. Yet, as the housing market declined, many homeowners and investors\nfound themselves unable or unwilling to meet their mortgage payments.\nThe economy and financial system may well have been able to absorb the downturn in\nhousing, if not for other contributing factors. Mortgage originators often sold off or\nsecuritized these risky loans as mortgage-backed securities and then resold them to other\ninvestors. What’s more, investors in these securities bought insurance against their\ndefault with another innovative product — credit default swaps — which has turned out\nto be riskier than expected.\nThese new products, however, were very complex and lacked transparency. They also\nresulted in even more interconnections among financial institutions, allowing the\nproblems in the U.S. housing market to spread to a wide array of financial institutions.\nAs house prices began to fall and mortgage delinquencies and defaults rose, market\n1\n\n\fparticipants grew uncertain about how to value the various complex financial instruments\nand which firms faced losses and to what degree. As a result, they became very riskaverse and reduced their exposure by curtailing their lending. This has led to higher\ncredit spreads or risk premiums on the securities of financial firms that may be at risk. It\nhas also led to rating agency downgrades and sharp declines in stock values, which\nultimately disrupted financial markets and created a widening credit crisis. Now\nnonfinancial firms are finding it difficult to obtain short-term credit to meet continuing\noperational needs and capital investments.\nToday, in the wake of this financial tsunami, I would like to offer my outlook for the\neconomy in the coming quarters and make some observations about the Fed’s actions and\nabout financial regulatory reform.\nLet me begin with the economic outlook.\nEconomic Outlook\nThe financial turmoil of the past year has taken its toll and the economy has slowed\nsignificantly since the early summer. Housing starts and permits continued to fall in\nOctober, and other recent monthly data — on auto sales, consumer spending, and\nindustrial production — have all pointed to a significant weakening of the economy.\nThis month the Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of manufacturing activity\nrecorded the lowest numbers in 18 years. Neither consumers nor businesses have much\nconfidence in the prospects for the economy in the near term.\nEven exports are no longer the bright spot they had been over the past two years. The\nstress in financial markets has now become global, undermining economic growth among\nour trading partners. Consequently, the prospect of a global slowdown further\ncontributes to a weaker outlook here in the U.S.\nThe latest report on real GDP growth indicated a moderate contraction in the third\nquarter. I anticipate a sharper decline in real GDP in the fourth quarter. This will likely\nput real GDP growth for 2008 below one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) measured on a\nfourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis. Growth in the first half of 2009 is also likely to be\nweak, with improvement in the second half of the year. Even so, overall growth for 2009\n(fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter) is likely to be below 2 percent.\nWith relatively weak performance over the next several quarters, I expect the\nunemployment rate to rise above 7 percent in 2009 before it begins a gradual decline later\nin the year.\nDuring 2009 the housing sector should finally bottom and the actions taken by the\nFederal Reserve and the Treasury will gradually help financial markets return to some\nsemblance of normalcy. So I expect the economy will start to pick up in the second half\nof next year with a gradual return to growth close to its trend of 2.7 percent in 2010 and\n2011. I should caution that many forecasters, including me, have anticipated an\n2\n\n\fimprovement in housing for some time and were proven wrong. What’s more, financial\ndisruptions continue to flare up unexpectedly. So more than the usual amount of\nuncertainty surrounds this forecast. We all must keep in mind that forecasting can be a\nhumbling exercise in the best of climates.\nAs for inflation, the decline in energy and commodity prices in recent months has\nreduced my own concern about rising inflation expectations — at least in the near term.\nThis is good news, but it does not mean the Fed should be complacent about its\nresponsibility to maintain price stability. The current monetary policy and the Fed’s\nextraordinary lending facilities created to address the crisis have injected large amounts\nof liquidity into the economy. We will need to begin withdrawing that liquidity when\nfinancial markets begin to stabilize or else risk fueling renewed inflationary pressures\ndown the road.\nAt a time of great concern about financial turmoil, we should keep in mind that instability\nin the general level of prices — whether inflation or deflation — is itself a significant\nsource of financial instability. Federal Reserve officials, myself included, have spoken of\nthe importance of keeping inflation expectations well anchored. When the public’s\ninflation expectations begin to rise, that can contribute to higher actual inflation. It is\ntherefore important for the Fed to maintain its credibility to keep inflation low and stable\nwhen large relative price movements in energy and food commodities led to large\nincreases in the consumer price index.\nIt is just as important that inflation expectations remain well anchored in the face of\nfalling energy prices. Significant declines in gasoline and fuel oil prices, for instance,\nhave recently led to declines in the consumer price index. This has prompted some\ncommentators to suggest that the U.S. is facing a threat of sustained deflation, as we did\nin the Great Depression or as Japan faced for a decade. I do not believe this is a serious\nthreat. Although the recent dramatic declines in energy prices have led to declines in the\nmonthly headline CPI, it still increased 3.7 percent over the last 12 months while core\nCPI increased 2.3 percent. So we are not close to a sustained deflation. The recent\ndeclines are simply the mirror image of the increases we saw earlier in the year. As long\nas inflation expectations remain well anchored, these declines in energy prices are\nunlikely to lead to sustained deflation any more than their previous increases were likely\nto lead to sustained inflation.\nTo help anchor expectations, the Fed must credibly commit to preventing sustained\ndeflation from becoming widely anticipated, just as it must prevent sustained inflation\nfrom becoming widely anticipated. I have long argued that monetary policy would\nbenefit from establishing a clear and explicit inflation target as a way of signaling a\ncommitment to keep inflation low and stable. Such an inflation target would be just as\nvaluable in preventing expectations of deflation from materializing.\n\n3\n\n\fFederal Reserve Actions\nTo address the financial crisis and its impact on the economy, the Fed has acted on\nmultiple fronts. Since September 2007 we have reduced the federal funds target rate by\n425 basis points in response to a steady deterioration in the economic outlook. As I have\nalready indicated, this added significant liquidity to the economy.\nWhile lowering the fed funds target seems like a fairly standard monetary policy\nresponse, the Fed also took historic actions to promote financial stability by expanding its\nrole as lender of last resort. Starting last year, the Fed expanded its existing discount\nwindow operations and created an alphabet soup of new lending facilities to help the\nfunding markets function more effectively. Some of these actions required the Fed to\ninvoke a special provision of the Federal Reserve Act — referred to as Section 13(3) —\nwhich gives the Fed the authority to lend to any individual, partnership, or corporation in\n“unusual and exigent circumstances.”\nPrior to this crisis, the Fed lent only to depository financial institutions — that is, banks,\nsavings and loans, savings banks, and credit unions — and such lending was typically\novernight. During the last eight months, we have made loans to primary securities\ndealers, investment banks, a global insurance company, and most recently to industrial\nand financial companies that issue commercial paper. These lending arrangements have\nbeen for terms ranging from 90 days to as long as 10 years in the case of the financing\nprovided in the Bear Stearns acquisition.\nPrior to this crisis, Fed lending typically amounted to less than 1 percent of total Fed\nassets. According to the latest data, lending has risen to nearly 50 percent.\nThe most dramatic decisions were made jointly by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.\nIn particular, the decisions to provide funding to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns\nby JPMorgan Chase, to lend to AIG, and to not commit funds to Lehman Brothers have\nraised fundamental questions about the role of the Fed in promoting financial stability.\nMore generally, the necessity of taking these actions suggests the need for a new\nregulatory structure to match the reality of our complex financial markets.\n\nPrinciples of Sound Central Banking\nThe current financial crisis and the actions by the Fed and Treasury to address it are\nleading to a restructuring of the financial services industry. We are already seeing major\ninvestment banks become bank holding companies, weaker financial institutions\nconsolidate into healthier ones, and various types of nonbank financial firms substantially\nrevise their business models.\nThe financial turmoil and the resulting restructuring in the marketplace have prompted\ncalls for the Fed to assume expanded responsibilities. Some envision the Fed’s becoming\nthe supervisor and regulator of a broad array of financial firms in order to ensure\n4\n\n\ffinancial stability. Some want to expand the Fed’s authority or give it a sweeping\nmandate to prevent systemic risk. Some want the Fed to lend to a wider range of\nfinancial institutions. Yet, before we seek to dramatically expand the Fed’s\nresponsibilities, I believe it is important to recognize the limits of what a central bank can\nand should do.\nIn general, we should avoid giving the Fed overly broad mandates, missions, or goals that\nconflict with the one goal that is uniquely the responsibility of a central bank: price\nstability. As I noted earlier, instability in the general level of prices — whether inflation\nor deflation — is itself a significant source of financial instability. Consequently, we\nmust make sure that in trying to cure one source of financial instability, we do not sow\nthe seeds of another.\nOver the past two decades, economists have learned to conduct monetary policy more\neffectively by following four general principles:\n•\n\nFirst, Clarity. Policymakers should set clear and explicit objectives. These\nobjectives must be realistic and feasible and not just what might be desirable.\n\n•\n\nSecond, Commitment. Policymakers must commit to conducting policy in a\nsystematic way over time, even when it seems expedient to abandon it.\n\n•\n\nThird, Transparency. Policymakers must be as transparent as possible in\ncommunicating their policies and actions to the public.\n\n•\n\nFourth, Independence. Experience has shown that monetary policy yields better\noutcomes when it operates independently of fiscal and political influence.\n\nI believe these four principles also apply broadly to other central bank roles, including\nour role in promoting financial stability. Indeed, we can think about how each of these\nprinciples applies to the challenges we face as a lender of last resort.\nClear and Explicit Objectives\nFortunately the Fed has had to act as a lender of last resort very infrequently. The\ntraditional goal of central bank lending has been to protect against systemic risk in the\nbanking system. So central banks traditionally fulfill their role as lender of last resort by\nlending to solvent banks with liquidity problems to prevent problems in one bank from\nspilling over and causing failures in otherwise sound institutions.\nHowever, financial instruments and the markets in which they are traded have become\nvery complex and interconnected. We have found that the failure of a major counterparty\n— even a nonbank — has the potential to severely disrupt many other financial\ninstitutions, their customers, and other markets. The lack of transparency in some of the\ninstruments and markets makes it more difficult for market participants to identify who is\nat risk and to what degree, increasing the systemic risk posed by such failures.\n5\n\n\fIn today’s financial system, we must devise new and clearer objectives for central bank\nlending. If the goal is to protect the financial system against systemic risk, then we must\nclearly define such risk and articulate in advance the circumstances and terms under\nwhich we will lend and to whom.\nI believe we should concentrate on financial markets that are critical to the efficient\nfunctioning of the payments system, rather than focusing on individual firms. Indeed, it\nwould be desirable to be in an environment where no firm was too big, or too\ninterconnected, to fail.\nEven so, we must be realistic and set objectives that are feasible. Central bank lending\ncannot prevent all types of financial instability. Indeed, the economy benefits from\nfinancial institutions’ and markets’ taking on and managing risk. That means inevitably\nsome firms will fail. As my friend the economist Allan Meltzer has said, “Capitalism\nwithout failure is like religion without sin. It doesn’t work.” * Our goal should not be to\ntry to prevent every failure. Instead, our goal should be to lower the probability of a\nfinancial crisis and the costs imposed from any troubled financial institution.\nCommitment to a Systematic Approach\nAccording to the second principle, policy should be systematic. This means that\npolicymakers should avoid unnecessary volatility by committing to a mostly predictable\nresponse to events — even when it seems expedient to do otherwise. Uncertainty breeds\nvolatility. I liken this to declaring the rules of the game in advance. If the rules are\nconstantly changing during the game, players don’t know what to do next, outcomes\nbecome highly uncertain, and resources will be unnecessarily wasted in the process.\nDuring the past year, the Fed has taken steps to limit the systemic risks caused by the\npotential failure of several large financial institutions. The decisions were always made\nbased on the risks to the financial markets, not the desire to preserve individual\ninstitutions. Yet, the old “rules of the game” were out of date. The ability to deal with\nthe potential failure of systemically important nonbank financial firms was limited. We\nhad to improvise. As a consequence we had no choice but to generate some uncertainty.\nWe must correct that going forward.\nTransparency\nThe third principle simply stresses that policymakers should be clear and transparent in\ncommunicating their policy and actions to the public. This is an important part of\nreducing the uncertainty and making the “rules of the game” clear.\nClarifying the Fed’s lending policy and the criteria that will be used in taking actions, as\nwell as the criteria that will be used to determine when to close any special lending\n\n*\n\nAllan Meltzer, “Asian Problems and the IMF,” Cato Journal, 17:3 (Winter 1998), pp. 267-74.\n\n6\n\n\ffacility no longer needed, will all help lower the costs of uncertainty during a financial\ncrisis.\nIndependence\nFinally, as we revisit our central bank lending policies, we must not overlook the\nimportance of central bank independence. The record shows that central bank\nindependence leads to more effective monetary policy. That principle is vital to our\nlending policy as well.\nTo protect that independence, central bank lending policies should avoid straying into the\nrealm of allocating credit across firms or sectors of the economy, which is best left to the\nmarketplace. The perception that the Federal Reserve is in the business of allocating\ncredit is sure to generate public pressures on the Fed from all sorts of interest groups. In\nmy view, if the government must intervene in allocating credit, it should be the\nresponsibility of the fiscal authority rather than the central bank. This division of labor,\nso to speak, will better ensure the Fed’s ability and credibility to maintain price stability\nand promote economic growth.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the past year has been a challenging time for the U.S. economy and for\npolicymakers. The Fed responded to the deteriorating economic outlook and ongoing\nstresses in financial markets with monetary policy and extraordinary actions to ensure\nfinancial stability. I expect economic growth will continue to be weak over the next\nseveral quarters before improving in the latter part of 2009 and then returning to neartrend growth in 2010 and 2011.\nBecause of the financial crisis and the response by the Treasury and the Fed, the financial\nservices industry is restructuring. When some normality returns to the markets — which\neventually it surely will — some type of regulatory reform will be needed.\nSome people may think that expanding the Federal Reserve’s regulatory and supervisory\nauthority would prevent the types of financial crises we have been experiencing this year.\nYet, I believe it is important to be realistic about recognizing the limits of what a central\nbank can and should do. A modern financial system will never be immune to all financial\nstress. Setting up expectations that the Fed will surely be unable to fulfill would\nundermine our ability to achieve our primary monetary policy and financial stability\nobjectives.\nThe exact outcome of this regulatory reform is unknown at this point. However, as we\nwork on this reform, I believe we must strive to develop sound policies that obey the four\nprinciples I have discussed today — clear and feasible objectives; a commitment to\nsystematic policies; transparency; and a healthy respect for the independence of the\ncentral bank.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fNovember 13, 2008\n\n1\n\nSome Thoughts on the Economy and Financial Regulatory Reform\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPresented to The Economics Club of Pittsburgh\nPittsburgh, PA\nNovember 13, 2008\n\nIntroduction\nToday I want to discuss two general topics that relate directly to our current financial situation.\nOne is the outlook for the economy and inflation. The other is financial regulatory reform. In\nparticular, I will focus on several issues that relate to the Federal Reserve’s roles in supervision,\nregulation, and financial stability.\nLet me begin with the economic outlook.\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Inflation\nRecent data — including the monthly data on housing, auto sales, consumer spending, and\nindustrial production — have all pointed to a significant weakening of the economy. The latest\nreport on real GDP growth indicated the economy contracted slightly in the third quarter. In\naddition, the increased stress in financial markets, leading to the seizing up of credit in\nSeptember and early October, has continued to disrupt the ability of businesses and households\nto borrow.\nWhat’s more, the stress in financial markets has now become global, weakening the prospects for\ngrowth among many of our trading partners. Since our economy has benefited substantially\nfrom strong exports over the past two years, the prospect of a global slowdown further\ncontributes to a weaker outlook for the U.S. economy going forward.\nAfter a slight contraction in real GDP in the third quarter, I anticipate a somewhat sharper decline\nin the fourth quarter. This forecast will put real GDP growth for 2008 in the neighborhood of\none-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) (measured on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis).\nGrowth in the first half of 2009 is also likely to be weak, but I expect improvement in the second\nhalf of the year. Even so, overall growth for 2009 (fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter) is likely to\nbe below 2 percent. With relatively weak performance over the next several quarters, I expect\nthe unemployment rate to rise above 7 percent in 2009 before it begins a gradual decline in the\nlatter half of the year.\nAs the housing sector finally bottoms out and the financial crisis abates during 2009, I expect we\n\n\fNovember 13, 2008\n\n2\n\nwill see the economy start to pick up. In 2010 and 2011, I expect real GDP growth will be close\nto its trend of 2.7 percent. With a return to more solid economic growth, the unemployment rate\nwill decline over time and return to near 5 percent.\nAs you know, this recent deterioration in the economic outlook led the FOMC to reduce its\nfederal funds rate target to 1 percent on October 29. Another factor in that decision was a\nlessening of the risk that inflation expectations would become unanchored. The decline in\nenergy and commodity prices in recent months has reduced my own concern about rising\ninflation expectations — at least in the near term. This is good news, but it does not mean we\nshould be complacent or ignore our responsibility to maintain price stability. Our current policy\nis injecting large amounts of liquidity into the economy. Unless we withdraw that liquidity in a\ntimely fashion, it could fuel renewed inflationary pressures down the road.\nLet me be clear that the economy still faces significant financial stress and the outlook remains\nhighly uncertain. While the actions by central banks and governments in a number of countries\nhave helped alleviate some of the financial pressures, it will still take some time before financial\nmarkets return to some sense of normalcy.\nThe consequences of the financial turmoil of the past year will be many. We are already seeing\nthe financial industry restructure itself as major investment banks become bank holding\ncompanies, weaker financial institutions consolidate into healthier ones, and various types of\nnonbank financial firms, once thought to be powerful engines for profit and growth, find they\nmust either substantially revise their business models or throw them out entirely.\nAnother consequence of the crisis is that the regulatory structure of the future is likely to look\ndifferent from the one we have today. That raises the question of what future role the Fed will\nplay in supervision, regulation, and financial stability, which brings me to my next topic.\n\nGeneral Principles for the Fed’s Role in Supervision, Regulation, and Financial Stability\nHistory tells us that financial crises invariably lead governments to adopt regulatory reforms\nintended to prevent similar crises in the future. In general, I would argue against making major\npolicy reforms in the “heat of battle” because doing so risks adopting policies that have\nunintended consequences. Such “quick fixes” may inadvertently hamper market competition or\ninnovation and create conditions that may provide the foundation of the next crisis. Moreover,\nwithout careful analysis of the crisis, hasty reform may fail to address the problem and could\nimpose unneeded and burdensome regulation.\nThe role of the central bank in a new regulatory environment will be an important issue in the\ndeliberations. Some proposals envision the Federal Reserve becoming the supervisor and\nregulator of a broad array of financial firms in order to ensure financial stability. I have a\nnumber of concerns about such proposals, especially those that go beyond the limits of what a\ncentral bank can and should do.\nIn general, we should avoid giving the Fed overly broad mandates, missions, or goals that\n\n\fNovember 13, 2008\n\n3\n\nconflict with the one goal that is uniquely the responsibility of a central bank — price stability.\nInstability in the general level of prices — whether inflation or deflation — is itself a significant\nsource of financial instability. Consequently, we must make sure that in trying to cure one source\nof financial instability, we do not sow the seeds of another.\nBoth theory and evidence suggest that sound monetary policy should be guided by four basic\nprinciples. First, policy should have clear and explicit objectives. These objectives must be\nrealistic and feasible, not just what might be desirable. For example, I have argued on several\noccasions that the expectations about monetary policy’s ability to manage the economy often\nexceed what can actually be accomplished. So we must be careful to ask only for what can be\ndelivered.\nSecond, policy must be conducted in a systematic way toward achieving the stated objectives.\nMoreover, to avoid unnecessary volatility, policymakers must be committed to this systematic\napproach over time, even when it seems expedient to abandon it. Third, policymakers should be\nclear and transparent in communicating their policy and actions to the public. Fourth, central\nbanks should remain independent of short-term political pressures. Experience tells us that\nindependent central banks are more effective in achieving their objective of price stability.\nI believe that these four principles — clearly stated and feasible objectives; a commitment to\nconduct policy in a systematic fashion; transparency; and independence — should apply broadly\nto other central bank roles, including our role in promoting financial stability and in exercising\nprudential supervision.\nAs we think more explicitly about regulatory reform, I believe that we should focus not just on\nmore regulation but on better regulation. For example, we should think about ways to strengthen\nmarket discipline and market infrastructures to make our financial system more resilient to\nshocks. In doing so, we must ensure that regulation does not inhibit innovation. For example,\ndespite much of the turmoil and problems with subprime mortgages, the majority of homeowners\nwho financed their homes with these new instruments are meeting their obligations. Indeed,\nthese new types of mortgage products have given many families an opportunity they might never\nhave had before — to live in their own home. Thus, the subprime mortgage has been a valuable\ninnovation for many consumers. We must be careful that heavy-handed regulation does not\ndiscourage innovations that make such progress possible.\nWith these guiding principles in mind, I want to touch on three areas I believe will be crucial\nelements of regulatory reform and the future role of the Fed. These include resolution\nmechanisms for failing financial firms; the regulation of payment and settlement systems; and\nthe scope and scale of the Fed’s role as lender of last resort.\nResolution Mechanisms for Failing Financial Firms\nThe rationale for banking regulation stems, in large part, from the dangers posed by systemic\nrisk. Systemic risk generally refers to the risk that problems at one financial institution will spill\nover to a broad set of otherwise healthy institutions, thereby posing a threat to the integrity of the\nfinancial system as a whole. This can occur because of linkages among financial institutions\n\n\fNovember 13, 2008\n\n4\n\nthrough counterparty borrowing and lending arrangements or through payment and settlement\nsystems. Lack of transparency, imperfect or asymmetric information, and uncertainty about\nexposures can all give rise to such financial contagion.\nOne of the lessons from the current financial crisis is that, for policymakers, bankruptcy is not an\nattractive option for a failing institution that poses systemic risk. In fact, the underlying rationale\nof bankruptcy law is maximizing the payoffs to creditors. Although state insurance regulators do\nhave special procedures for the orderly liquidation of regulated insurance companies that fail,\ntheir focus is on paying off policyholders and claimants. Their procedures are not intended to\naddress systemic risk.\nSince systemic risk involves an externality not easily represented in normal bankruptcy\nproceedings, we have long had a specialized regimen for dealing with bank failures. The FDIC\nmay consider systemic concerns in a failing bank’s resolution and has the authority to act as a\nreceiver for a failed commercial bank and run a bridge bank for up to five years. However, there\nis no similar mechanism for the orderly liquidation of most nonbank financial firms that pose\nsystemic risk. Policymakers are thus left with one of two outcomes: (1) very costly failures; or\n(2) very costly interventions to avoid the failure. Since there is no clear commitment to, or\nmechanism for, a systematic approach to such failing financial firms, substantial uncertainty\narises, leaving market participants guessing about how policymakers will respond.\nIndeed, the financial problems at Bear Stearns, AIG, and Lehman elicited different responses.\nWhen serious funding problems led to the prospect that Bear Stearns might go bankrupt and\npotentially bring down many other financial firms and disrupt important pieces of the payment\nsystem, the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Treasury, invoked its emergency powers as\nlender of last resort to allow for a more orderly resolution of the firm’s problems. A privatesector buyer (JPMorganChase), with Fed assistance, then purchased Bear Stearns. When AIG\nand Lehman faced severe funding problems, the Fed and the Treasury again attempted to find\nprivate-sector solutions to avoid the imminent failure of these firms. None was forthcoming.\nThe judgment was made that given the nature of AIG’s financial obligations; its disorderly\ncollapse would severely threaten financial stability. So the Federal Reserve provided an\nemergency credit line to facilitate an orderly resolution. In the case of Lehman, the Fed and\nTreasury declined to commit public funds, because the judgment was that its failure posed less\nsystemic risk, since Lehman’s problems had been known to the market for some time.\n\nIn hindsight, some have criticized these decisions. But at the time, it was a reasonable judgment\nbased on systemic risk. I also believe that the failure of Lehman was a symptom and not the\ncause of the resurgence of financial market stress we saw in late September and early October.\nThese actions did lead to uncertainty about how nonbank financial failures would be handled,\nand arguably, this uncertainty contributed to the stress in the markets. To help alleviate such\nuncertainty, we should seriously consider establishing alternative resolution mechanisms that\nwould be more predictable and systematic in their approach, as suggested by the principles I\nhave previously outlined.\nSince my first principle is to set clear and feasible policy objectives, let me at least be clear about\n\n\fNovember 13, 2008\n\n5\n\nwhat I have in mind for such resolution mechanisms. In my view, the objective is not to prevent\nthe failure of an individual firm, but to reduce the systemic risks that such a failure may create\nwhile minimizing any losses to the taxpayer.\nOne alternative resolution mechanism might follow the one used by the FDIC. That is, extend\nsome type of “bridge-bank” authority to regulators of nonbank financial firms that pose systemic\nrisk. It is not clear to me whether centralizing that type of bridge authority in one regulatory\nbody — whether it is the FDIC, the OCC, the Fed, or the SEC — would be optimal. Certainly\nthat is an issue for further study.\nWe can look to banking for other examples of systematic policy approaches. For instance, the\nprompt corrective action provisions of the FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA) provide an example\nof a systematic approach that is required when a bank gets into trouble and is at risk of failing.\nTrigger points are specified for when bank regulators must take action to deal with the bank’s\nproblems. Because Congress embodied these prompt corrective action provisions in legislation,\nthe regulators are insulated from near-term political pressures and constrained to behave in ways\nthat are more systematic. This offers the regulators a degree of political independence and the\nmarkets more clarity.\nRegulation of the Payment System & Clearing and Settlement Systems\nAnother issue that policymakers and legislators will need to address is the Fed’s role in\nregulating the payment system and in promoting effective and robust clearing and settlement\nsystems. This financial crisis has demonstrated that innovative financial products can create new\nrisks in the payments system. Sometimes those risks are not well understood — at least not until\nsomething breaks.\nDue to the increased complexity and inter-relationships among various innovative financial\ninstruments and the markets in which they are traded, we have found that the failure of a major\ncounterparty has the potential to disrupt many other financial institutions, their customers, and\nother markets. The lack of transparency in some of these instruments and markets makes it more\ndifficult for market participants to identify who is at risk and to what degree. The consequence\nof the lack of transparency and potential asymmetric information is to increase the systemic risks\nof such failures.\nThe New York Fed, for example, recognized emerging problems in the clearing and settlement of\nover-the-counter credit default swaps even before the financial crisis began. These difficulties\nincluded a lack of standards, automation, or even basic information about the trades.\nChairman Bernanke has suggested that the Fed have a formal mandate to regulate systemically\nimportant payments and settlement systems. Determining which systems are systemically\nimportant, whether to regulate them, and by whom will require careful consideration. In doing\nso, we must avoid giving the Fed a mandate for financial or systemic stability that is too vague or\ntoo sweeping or that lacks clearly defined principles. We must set objectives that are feasible.\nOtherwise, over-promising puts at risk the credibility of the central bank.\n\n\fNovember 13, 2008\n\nIn some cases, it is feasible and desirable to promote private-sector solutions, market\nmechanisms, or infrastructures that help strengthen the resiliency of the payments system\nwithout heavy-handed regulation. One such approach is for industry participants themselves to\nset up a central counterparty, such as a formal exchange or clearinghouse. A regulator, whether\nthe Fed or another agency, might then be responsible for ensuring the appropriate functioning of\nthe central clearinghouse rather than being involved in overseeing multiple bilateral trading\narrangements. The clearinghouse would help facilitate transparency and the use of more\nstandardized products. Such an initiative is currently under consideration for the over-thecounter derivatives market.\nThe Scope and Scale of the Fed’s Role as Lender of Last Resort\nLet me now turn to my last issue. As policymakers and legislators consider regulatory reform,\nthey will need to address the scope and scale of the Fed’s role as lender of last resort.\nBy any measure, we have expanded the role of the Fed as lender of last resort to historic\nproportions to deal with the current financial crisis. Starting last year, the Fed expanded its\nexisting discount window operations and created a series of new lending facilities to help\nfunding markets function more effectively. Some of these actions required the Fed to invoke\nsection 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act so that it could lend temporarily to nondepository\ninstitutions in “unusual and exigent circumstances.”\nThis panoply of lending facilities bears little resemblance to the classic textbook image of the\nFed’s discount window in normal times. It doesn’t even look similar to lending activities during\nother financial crises since the Great Depression.\nConsider how much has changed: Prior to this crisis, the Fed lent only to depository financial\ninstitutions — banks, savings and loans, savings banks, and credit unions — and such lending\nwas typically overnight. During the past 16 months, we have made loans to primary securities\ndealers, investment banks, a global insurer, and most recently to issuers of commercial paper,\nincluding financial and nonfinancial companies. These lending arrangements have been for\nterms as long as 84 days for the Term Auction Facility, 90 days for the primary credit “discount\nwindow,” and even as long as 10 years for the financing provided in the Bear Stearns merger.\nPrior to this financial crisis, Fed lending typically amounted to less than 1 percent of the total\nassets on the Fed’s balance sheet. By the first week in November, it had risen to about 44\npercent.\nThis expansion of the scope and scale of Fed lending may not have been so large had we had\nbetter resolution mechanisms to deal with such failing firms as Bear Stearns and AIG. And\nperhaps our lending would not have become so wide-ranging had there been better regulation or\nmore resiliency in the payment and settlement systems, including more transparency about the\nmarkets for mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps.\nEventually we will have to face the issue of the appropriate scope and scale of the Fed’s lending\nfacilities once this financial crisis passes. We must consider how to wind down some of these\n\n6\n\n\fNovember 13, 2008\n\n7\n\nfacilities and how we should operate the discount window in “normal” times. We must also\nconsider how we should proceed the next time a crisis arises.\nDifficult questions will arise about if and when firms without access to the discount window in\nnormal times should be given ad hoc access to the Fed’s lending facilities in a future crisis, and\nunder what terms and conditions. Intervening too often or expanding too broadly the set of\ninstitutions that have access to the central bank’s credit facilities can create moral hazard, distort\nthe market mechanism for allocating credit, and thereby increase the probability and severity of a\nfuture financial crisis. So it would be useful to explore whether we can develop systematic\napproaches to making decisions about the existence of “unusual and exigent circumstances” that\nmight help contain such moral hazard.\nClarifying the Fed’s lending policy and the criteria that will be used in taking actions, as well as\nthe criteria that will be used to determine when to close any special lending facility no longer\nneeded, will all help lower the costs of uncertainty during a financial crisis.\nTo lay a foundation for those decisions, we should follow the general principles I cited earlier.\nThe central bank should clearly state objectives and set boundaries for its lending that it can\ncredibly commit to follow. We should take a systematic approach to clarify the criteria on which\nthe central bank will intervene in markets or extend its credit facilities to banks — and to\nnonbank financial firms. We should be prepared to stay the course once our policy is set and\nclearly communicate the lending policy and the actions we take in our capacity as lender of last\nresort.\nAs we revisit our central bank lending policies, we must not overlook one other important\nprinciple: central bank independence. Just as we know that independence leads to more effective\nmonetary policy, free from fiscal and political influence, I believe independence is vital to a\nmore effective lending policy.\nTo protect that independence, the central bank’s lending policies should avoid straying into the\nrealm of allocating credit across firms or sectors of the economy, which I believe is appropriately\nthe purview of the market. The perception that the Federal Reserve is in the business of\nallocating credit is sure to generate public pressures on the Fed from all sorts of interest groups.\nIn my view, if government must intervene in allocating credit, doing so should be the\nresponsibility of the fiscal authority rather than the central bank.\nBy setting objectives and pursuing a systematic approach to its lending policies that avoids credit\nallocation, the Fed can operate independently from these types of pressures, resist them when\nthey arise, and better ensure its ability and credibility to maintain price stability and sustainable\nlong-term growth.\n\nConclusion\nLet me conclude with a few final observations. Today I have highlighted some of the important\nissues that regulators and legislators will need to address as they consider the Fed’s role in\n\n\fNovember 13, 2008\n\n8\n\nfinancial stability and regulatory reform.\nThe current financial crisis and the actions by the Fed and Treasury to address it are leading to a\nrestructuring of the financial services industry. As I said before, history tells us that financial\ncrises invariably lead to regulatory reforms. Indeed, when some semblance of normality returns\nto the financial markets, I expect some type of regulatory reform will be warranted. Yet, there\nare risks in rushing into these regulatory issues without establishing in advance the guiding\nprinciples and objectives for such regulations.\nSome may think access to the Fed’s lending facilities should be permanently expanded to include\na wide range of financial institutions. I believe such expanded access to central bank credit\nwould raise significant issues of moral hazard that would need to be addressed. And I have\nurged that we must continue to avoid compromising the Fed’s independence — one of the great\nstrengths of central banks.\nSome people might think that expanding the Federal Reserve’s regulatory and supervisory\nauthority and giving it a sweeping mandate for financial stability would prevent the types of\nfinancial crises we have been experiencing this year. That is unrealistic.\nI have raised several concerns about adopting overly broad regulatory reforms that give the\nFederal Reserve a role that goes beyond the limits of what a central bank can and should do. We\nshould avoid giving the Fed new missions or goals that conflict with the one goal that is uniquely\nthe responsibility of a central bank — price stability. This is one objective that cannot be\ndelegated to an agency other than the central bank. No other institution can be charged with this\nobjective, since no institution other than the central bank is capable of delivering it.\nGoing forward our focus should be on better regulation, not necessarily more regulation. We\nneed to focus on ways to strengthen our financial markets to make market discipline more\neffective at mitigating systemic risk. We should think about which financial markets are critical\nto the efficient functioning of the payment system rather than focusing on individual firms.\nIdeally, we need to determine which aspects of the financial system are critical and then make\nsure we have the market mechanisms, regulations, and supervision to ensure those sectors are\nresilient.\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of the FOMC or the\nFederal Reserve System.\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\f2\n\nThe Limits of Central Banking\nCharles I. Plosser, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPresented to the Council on Foreign Relations\nNew York, NY\nOctober 8, 2008\nIntroduction\nToday I want to discuss the importance of thinking realistically about the central bank’s\ncapabilities as we look beyond the current turmoil to the future of the Federal Reserve’s\nresponsibilities for monetary policy and financial stability. The financial turmoil of the past year\nand the consequent restructuring in the marketplace have prompted calls for the Fed to assume\nexpanded responsibilities. Some envision the Fed’s becoming the supervisor and regulator of a\nbroad array of financial firms in order to ensure financial stability.\n\nYet, before we seek to dramatically expand the Fed’s responsibilities, I believe it is important to\nrecognize that there are limits to what central banking can do, and this has implications for what\ncentral banking should do.\n\nThe Fed needs to be accountable for meeting its goals. Yet, we must take care to set reasonable\nexpectations for what a central bank can achieve. We must recognize that over-promising can\nerode the credibility of a central bank’s commitment to meet any of its goals, whether for\nmonetary policy or financial stability. My comments today will touch on both of these central\nbank responsibilities.\n\nWhat Monetary Policy Can and Cannot Do\nLet me start with monetary policy. Much of the public discussion of the Federal Reserve’s\nmonetary policy seems to assume that the Fed’s job is to stabilize the economy against\nmacroeconomic shocks — such as a sharp rise in the price of oil or a sharp drop in the housing\nmarket. The impression one gets is that, if the Fed were simply quicker or smarter or given more\nregulatory powers by Congress, we could always counteract the adverse effects of these shocks\nand easily achieve monetary policy’s dual mandate to keep the economy growing with full\n\n\f3\n\nemployment and little or no inflation.\n\nHowever, I see two problems with this view. First, it fails to recognize the difference between\nwhat the Fed can do in the long run and what it might be able to do in the short run. Second, it\nassumes the Fed has the ability to stabilize the economy against the adverse effects of almost all\nmacroeconomic shocks. On both counts, this view seriously overstates the true capability of the\nFed or any central bank in modern market economies.\n\nIn truth, the only thing that sound monetary policy can affect in the long run is the rate of\ninflation. Changes in monetary policy can affect real economic activity, such as the\nunemployment rate or output growth, but only temporarily and with considerable uncertainty as\nto timing and magnitude. Consider the case where economic activity is slowing or declining. If\nwe increase the money supply to lower interest rates or to keep them low, we may temporarily\nboost economic activity because it may take a while for prices to respond to the additional\namount of money in circulation. The temporary boost occurs with a so-called “long and\nvariable” lag. Indeed, the effect of lower interest rates on economic activity may not be felt for\nnine to 18 months. Eventually, though, prices will rise, the purchasing power of money will\nerode, and the boost to economic activity will fade away. Moreover, the effect on the real\neconomy can be completely offset if inflation expectations rise in reaction to the\naccommodation. That is why we place considerable stress on our credibility and commitment to\nkeep inflation low and stable.\n\nThe task is further complicated when one realizes that all sorts of shocks are simultaneously\nbuffeting the economy. Shocks can occur to specific sectors or specific regions. Some may be\nlarge and some may be small. Some may be positive and boost economic growth, while others\nmay be detrimental to growth. If monetary policy responded to one shock in an attempt to offset\nits possible effects, it may aggravate the effects of another shock.\n\nThus, monetary policy’s ability to neutralize the impact of shocks is actually quite limited.\nSuccessfully implementing such an economic stabilization policy requires predicting the state of\nthe economy more than a year from now with a high degree of accuracy — including\n\n\f4\n\nanticipating the nature, timing, and likely impact of future shocks. The truth is that economists\nsimply do not possess the knowledge to make forecasts with such accuracy. Attempts to stabilize\nthe economy will, more likely than not, end up providing stimulus when none is needed, or vice\nversa. Indeed, aggressive attempts at stabilization can, in fact, increase volatility rather than\nreduce it.\n\nIn many cases the effects of shocks to the economy simply have to play out over time, so that\nmarkets eventually adjust to a new equilibrium. For example, monetary policy cannot keep the\nprices of gasoline and home heating oil at the low levels they were when crude oil was $30 a\nbarrel. And monetary policy cannot reverse the sharp declines in housing prices over the past\nyear. Monetary policy simply cannot eliminate the need for households or businesses to make\nreal adjustments when such shocks occur.\n\nThis doesn’t mean monetary policy should be unresponsive to changes in broad economic\nconditions. The best strategy is to set our policy instrument — the federal funds rate —\nconsistent with controlling inflation over the intermediate term. This implies that the target\nfederal funds rate will vary with the overall outlook for the economy. By keeping inflation stable\nwhen shocks occur, monetary policy can foster the conditions that enable households and\nbusinesses to make the necessary adjustments to return the economy to its sustainable growth\npath — although depending on the nature of the shock, this new growth path may be lower,\nhigher, or the same as its previous growth path. But monetary policy itself does not determine\nthis sustainable path.\n\nFor example, if an adverse productivity shock results in a substantial reduction in the outlook for\neconomic growth, then real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates tend to fall. As long as inflation\nis at an acceptable level, the appropriate monetary policy is to reduce the federal funds rate to\nfacilitate the adjustment to lower real interest rates. Failure to do so could result in a\nmisallocation of resources, a steadily declining rate of inflation, and, perhaps, even deflation.\n\nConversely, when the outlook for future economic growth is revised upward, real market interest\nrates will tend to rise. Provided that inflation is at an acceptable level, we would want to\n\n\f5\n\nfacilitate this adjustment by raising the federal funds rate. Failure to do so would again result in\na misallocation of resources and, in this case, a steadily rising rate of inflation.\n\nIn both cases, I view changes in the Fed’s target interest rate as responding to economic\nconditions in order to keep inflation low and stable. Monetary policy is not “trading off” more\ninflation for less unemployment in order to stabilize the economy against an adverse shock, nor\nis it “trading off” more unemployment for less inflation when there is a favorable shock to the\neconomy. The empirical support for such a trade-off is tenuous at best, and the empirical support\nfor the view that central banks can favorably exploit such a potential trade-off is even weaker.\n\nAsking monetary policy to attempt to offset the effects of adverse shocks to the economy is\nunlikely to work, and it will surely exact a toll in terms of higher inflation. This is particularly\ntroublesome, since it would undercut the hard-earned credibility of the Fed’s commitment to\ncontrol inflation. This loss of credibility could lead to more variability in the public’s\nexpectations about future inflation. As we saw in the late 1970s and early 1980s, such an\nunanchoring of inflation expectations makes it more difficult and costly to reduce inflation when\nit is too high. This, in turn, would also make it harder to achieve maximum sustainable growth,\nthe other part of our dual mandate, since high and variable inflation makes adjustments in labor\nand product markets more costly.\n\nThis is not a new concern. In his presidential address to the American Economic Association\nover 40 years ago, Milton Friedman cautioned the economics profession:\n\n“…we are in danger of assigning to monetary policy a larger role than it can perform, in\ndanger of asking it to accomplish tasks that it cannot achieve, and, as a result, in danger\nof preventing it from making the contribution that it is capable of making.” 1\n\nThis caution is well worth remembering as it is still relevant today.\n\nOf course, Friedman also recognized that some shocks might require a response — in particular,\n1\n\nMilton Friedman, “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, 58:1 (March 1968), pp. 1-17.\n\n\f6\n\nthose that, in his words, “offer a ‘clear and present danger.’” In my view, shocks that put the\nstability of the financial system at significant risk require a response. Indeed, over the past year,\nthe Federal Reserve has aggressively eased monetary policy and employed innovative liquidity\ntools to help mitigate the effects of the financial turmoil.\n\nFinancial Stability, Regulation, and the Fed’s Role\nThe widespread effects of this financial turmoil have focused attention on the role of central\nbanks in supporting financial stability.\n\nThe Fed, as lender of last resort, has undertaken several liquidity measures intended to address\nextreme financial stress to forestall contagion and mitigate systemic risk. One role financial\nintermediaries perform is bearing and managing the liquidity risk that arises from funding longterm assets with short-term liabilities. Businesses are able to get funding for projects that may\nnot pay off until sometime in the future, and financial intermediaries are able to meet savers’\nwithdrawals of funds with retained earnings or by selling off liquid assets. In most cases, this\nmaturity transformation works fine.\n\nHowever, if depositors and other liability holders suddenly demand large withdrawals, an\nintermediary may be forced to sell long-term assets at prices below their value if they were held\nto maturity. The intermediary’s illiquidity problem could turn into a solvency problem,\neventually leading to the intermediary’s failure. Such failures have the potential to cascade\nthroughout counterparties, ultimately leading to a major breakdown of borrowing and lending in\nthe economy. In times of crisis, such as the situation we have found ourselves in this past year,\nthe Fed must act as lender of last resort to provide liquidity.\n\nSince the summer of 2007, we have set up various channels through which financial institutions\ncan borrow from the Fed against a wide range of collateral. This has provided direct liquidity to\nfinancial institutions, thereby helping to meet our responsibility for ensuring financial stability. I\nwant to stress that the Fed has sought to ensure that solvent institutions facing temporary\nliquidity problems remain solvent. The intention was not to prop up insolvent institutions.\nSimilarly, I want to emphasize that, although the Fed has played a role in the resolution of\n\n\f7\n\nsystemically important financial firms, the intention has been to protect the orderly functioning\nof the money market and thus to stem systemic risk to the broader economy — not to address the\nsolvency issues of individual institutions.\n\nOur preference is to allow market forces to handle any required restructuring in the financial\nservices industry. However, in some cases this is not possible when the risks to financial stability\nare too high.\n\nRegardless of our intentions, we need to recognize that by taking these actions, we create\nexpectations about future interventions and who will have access to central bank lending. These\nexpectations, in turn, can create moral hazard by influencing firms’ risk management incentives\nand the types of financial contracts they write, which may ultimately increase the probability and\nseverity of future financial crises.\n\nGoing forward, just as we should avoid setting unrealistic expectations for monetary policy, we\nshould also avoid encouraging unrealistic expectations about what the Fed can do to combat\nfinancial instability. As I have argued, in times of financial crisis, a central bank should act as\nthe lender of last resort by lending freely at a penalty rate against good collateral. Yet, recent\nexperience suggests we need to clarify what the Fed can and cannot be expected to do in today’s\ncomplex financial environment.\n\nThe events of the past year underscore the importance of carefully assessing the current financial\nregulatory structure. Regulatory reforms should aim to lower the chances of financial crisis in the\nfirst place, for example, by setting capital and liquidity standards that encourage firms to\nappropriately manage risk. We should consider market structures, clearing mechanisms, and\nresolution procedures that will reduce the systemic fallout from failures of financial firms.\nIndeed, it would be desirable to be in an environment where no firm was too big, or too\ninterconnected, to fail.\n\nYet regulatory reforms must recognize that modern financial systems will never be immune to\nfinancial problems. Encouraging the belief that any system of financial regulation and\n\n\f8\n\nsupervision can prevent all types of financial instability would be a mistake. Instead, our goal\nshould be to lower the probability of a financial crisis and the costs imposed from any troubled\nfinancial institution.\n\nAs we move forward with regulatory reforms, we must carefully consider the role the Fed should\nplay and our responsibilities for promoting financial stability.\n\nThe Fed has learned much over the past two decades about how to conduct monetary policy\nmore effectively. I believe the general principles for sound monetary policy are just as\napplicable to our responsibilities for promoting financial stability and fulfilling our role as lender\nof last resort.\n\nIn conducting monetary policy, we have learned that clearly stating our policy objectives; taking\na systematic approach to achieving these objectives; and committing to this systematic approach\nover time, even when it seems expedient to abandon it, can deliver better growth and inflation\noutcomes. In addition, as my colleague here on the podium, Alan Blinder, has stressed, central\nbankers must be as transparent as possible and communicate their views on monetary policy\nclearly to the public, to whom we must be accountable.2\n\nI believe that these principles should also apply to our lending polices. In particular, I believe\nthat the central bank should clearly state objectives and set boundaries for its lending that it can\ncredibly commit to follow. Clarifying the criteria on which the central bank will intervene in\nmarkets or extend its credit facilities is not only essential but critical. Intervening too often or\nexpanding too broadly the set of institutions that have regular access to the central bank’s credit\nfacilities can create moral hazard, distort the market mechanism for allocating credit, and thereby\nincrease the probability and severity of a future financial crisis. Thus, a too liberal lending\npolicy would undermine our lending policy’s intended goal of financial stability. Of course,\nannouncing the central bank’s criteria ex ante does not commit it to act as stated in every case,\nbut it does raise the costs of deviating from the criteria.\nExperience has also shown that when a central bank can conduct its monetary policy\n2\n\nAlan Blinder, Central Banking in Theory and Practice, The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1998.\n\n\f9\n\nindependently of the fiscal authority and political influence, it can achieve better outcomes\nbecause it is able to take a longer-term perspective in pursuing its objectives. This principle of\ncentral bank independence is crucial.\n\nIn setting our lending policies we must avoid taking actions that stray into the realm of allocating\ncredit across sectors of the economy, which in my view is appropriately the purview of the\nmarket. But if government must intervene, it should be the responsibility of the fiscal authority.\nExpanding the types of assets on the Fed’s balance sheet from Treasury securities to a wider\narray of assets, including loans to a wider variety of institutions, as we have done over the past\nyear in pursuit of financial stability, does raise concerns in my mind, in part because it increases\nthe number of entities that may seek to influence Fed policies. The Fed needs to operate\nindependently from these pressures and resist them when they arise so that its policies benefit\nsociety at large over the longer term and not any particular constituencies in the near term.\n\nAnother consideration in setting the Fed’s financial stability and regulatory responsibilities is\nhow they interact with our monetary policy goals. Expanding the Fed’s regulatory\nresponsibilities too broadly increases the chances that there will be short-run conflicts between\nour monetary policy goals and our supervisory and regulatory goals. It is particularly important\nthat any such expansion not undermine the credibility of our commitment to price stability. For\nexample, it would be a mistake for the central bank to pursue an inflationary monetary policy in\norder to temporarily alleviate funding pressure on financial institutions. While financial\ninstitutions might be better off in the short run, higher inflation would hurt them as well as the\nrest of the economy in the long run.\n\nAs we consider the Fed’s financial stability and regulatory responsibilities, we must also be\ncareful not to compromise the Fed’s independence. Nor should we undertake tasks that would\nundermine our ability to meet our dual-mandate objectives of ensuring price stability and\nfostering sustainable economic growth.\n\n\f10\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the past year has been a challenging time for the U.S. economy and for policymakers.\nThe Fed responded to the deteriorating economic outlook and continued stresses in financial\nmarkets with its monetary policy and liquidity facilities. Restructuring is occurring in the\nfinancial services industry, and it is clear that when some normality returns to the markets —\nwhich eventually it surely will — some type of regulatory reform will be needed.\n\nSome people may think expanding the Federal Reserve’s regulatory and supervisory authority\nwould prevent the types of financial crises we have been experiencing this year. Yet, I have tried\nto raise some cautionary flags about going beyond the limits of what a central bank can and\nshould do. A modern financial system cannot be immune to all financial stress. Setting up\nexpectations that the Fed will surely be unable to fulfill would undermine our ability to achieve\nour primary monetary policy and financial stability objectives. Regulatory reforms should aim to\nreduce the probability and economic severity of future periods of instability but should not be\nexpected to eliminate them entirely.\n\nAs legislators consider regulatory reforms, they should avoid giving the Fed new missions or\ngoals that conflict with the one goal that is uniquely the responsibility of a central bank — price\nstability. No other institution is charged with this objective, and no other institution can deliver it.\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\f1\nPERSPECTIVES ON THE ECONOMY, INFLATION,\nAND MONETARY POLICY\nPhiladelphia Business Journal Book of Lists Power Breakfast\nJuly 22, 2008\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be here today to help recognize those of you in the field\nof finance whose organizations are featured in the Philadelphia Business Journal’s 2008\nBook of Lists. You are here this morning because of your leadership — and the\nleadership exhibited by your organizations — during what has been a tumultuous time in\nthe financial markets.\n\nOne of my most important duties as president of a regional Reserve Bank is to take\ninformation about this District’s economy to the monetary policymaking meetings of the\nFederal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (or FOMC). My staff at the\nPhiladelphia Reserve Bank and I gather such information through a variety of means,\nincluding our Business Outlook Survey of manufacturing firms, consultations with\nexecutives in a variety of other sectors, and meetings with our board of directors and\nadvisory councils. A number of the financial organizations represented here today\nperiodically provide insights to help us better understand economic and financial\ndevelopments in our region. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your\nhelp.\n\nToday, I want to share my thoughts about the economy and the financial markets. In\ndoing so, I will comment briefly on how our economy got here and how I think it is likely\nto evolve over the next 18 months or so. I also want to devote part of my time to\ndiscussing my views about inflation and inflationary expectations. In particular, I want to\n\n\f2\nexplain why it is so important that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, and\nwhy I believe that is key to keeping inflation itself under control.\n\nWhile we are on the subject of inflation, I also want to spend a moment on the distinction\nbetween headline inflation and core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. As\nyou know, headline inflation has been generating, well, headlines, with record prices for\ncrude oil and many food commodities. Yet, core inflation — the measure policymakers\nhave monitored closely for many years — has not risen as much. I will discuss how I\nthink we should interpret this behavior and how it affects monetary policy.\n\nLet me begin with some observations about the economy and the outlook before\nreturning to the topic of inflation and inflation expectations.\n\nThe Evolution of the Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nLast month at its June meeting, the FOMC voted to keep the federal funds rate at 2.00\npercent, after a series of seven reductions from 5.25 percent beginning in September\n2007. This easing of monetary policy came in response to deterioration in the outlook for\nthe economy. All of us know in hindsight the main reasons for the change in outlook for\neconomic growth: the sustained declines in the housing sector, the drag of higher energy\nprices on the broader economy, and the precipitous decline in the subprime mortgage\nmarket, which led to further disruptions in financial markets and ensuing spillover effects\non real economic activity.\n\nThe financial turmoil was triggered by rising defaults on a broad class of subprime\nmortgages that exceeded what investors or rating agencies had anticipated. This led\ninvestors to question the value of a broad class of derivatives and securitized assets that\nwere backed by these mortgages. Investors were also increasingly unsure how much\nexposure various institutions had to these questionable assets. Market participants\nbecame very risk-averse and uncertain about how to value a broad array of financial\ninstruments and institutions. Moreover, the markets lost confidence in the rating\n\n\f3\nagencies’ ability to appropriately classify the risk of various instruments. This only\ncompounded the problems and prompted disruptions in the markets of a wide range of\nfinancial claims. We saw a rapid and substantial widening of risk spreads, and, in certain\nfinancial markets, trading became extremely thin or shut down completely. In particular,\nfinancial institutions found it more difficult and expensive to access the short-term\nfunding necessary to manage their businesses.\n\nThe disruptions in financial markets led the Federal Reserve to take actions, some of\nwhich were unprecedented, to help ensure financial stability and limit systemic risk.\nThese actions included lowering the discount rate and narrowing its spread to the\nFOMC’s federal funds rate target; extending the term of discount window loans to as\nlong as 90 days; and creating three new lending facilities that were intended to allow\nshort-term funding markets to function more effectively: the Term Auction Facility\n(TAF), the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), and the Primary Dealer Credit\nFacility (PDCF). The PDCF, in fact, opened the Fed’s discount window to nonbank\nfinancial firms for the first time since the 1930s. In addition, the Fed took special steps to\nensure that the collapse of investment firm Bear Stearns would not cause serious harm to\nother financial institutions or their customers.\n\nAs the financial market disruptions broadened, their potential spillover effects to the real\neconomy were incorporated into economic forecasts, including those made by FOMC\nparticipants. The FOMC responded to the deterioration in the economic outlook by\nlowering its targeted federal funds rate appreciably. The substantial easing of monetary\npolicy — a reduction in the federal funds rate target by 325 basis points since last\nSeptember — has appropriately ensured that monetary policy is consistent with market\nforces that will bring economic growth back toward its long-term trend over the next\nyear.\n\nCertainly sluggish economic growth is painful for both consumers and businesses, and\nsupporting sustainable economic growth is an important part of the Federal Reserve’s\ndual mandate. But it is only one part. Congress has also made the Federal Reserve —\n\n\f4\nand only the Federal Reserve — responsible for ensuring price stability. Inflation, like\nslow growth, is also painful for consumers, those on fixed incomes, and businesses. Our\ndual mandate does not say we should ignore one of those mandates or shift attention from\none objective to the other when it seems convenient to do so. I believe that would result\nin very poor economic outcomes and, most likely, greater volatility for the economy. We\nmust be attentive to both growth and inflation in a consistent and systematic way, and as\nwe are all aware, inflation has been rising. To some extent this reflects sharp increases in\nthe prices of globally traded commodities. Energy prices certainly have kept headline\nmeasures of inflation quite high. In June, the consumer price index (CPI) was nearly 5\npercent higher than its level a year ago. Core CPI inflation was 2.4 percent, above the\nlevel consistent with price stability. The outlook for inflation has been deteriorating.\nFOMC participants’ forecast for core inflation in 2008 has risen by nearly 50 basis points\nover the past year, and their forecast for headline inflation is up about 75 basis points\nsince April.\n\nThe consequence of our easing of monetary policy is that the inflation-adjusted — or real\n— interest rate on federal funds is now negative — between minus 1 percent and minus 2\npercent. The last time we saw such a negative real fed funds rate was in 2003-2004. But\nthe environment then was much different than it is now. Back then, the Fed was\nconcerned about the threat of deflation. Today, as we all know, this is not the case.\nMany of us are concerned about rising inflation rates.\n\nKeeping policy too accommodative for too long worsens our inflation problem. Inflation\nis already too high and inconsistent with our goal of — and responsibility to ensure —\nprice stability. We will need to reverse course — the exact timing depends on how the\neconomy evolves, but I anticipate the reversal will need to be started sooner rather than\nlater. And I believe it will likely need to begin before either the labor market or the\nfinancial markets have completely turned around.\n\n\f5\nEconomic Outlook\n\nMy own outlook for the rest of this year is for continued sluggish growth and weakness in\nlabor markets. My 2008 forecast is for GDP growth of around 1.7 percent, which is near\nthe upper end of the range of FOMC participants’ projections. This is a somewhat better\npicture than just a few months ago. I will remind you that many forecasters in the early\nspring anticipated that the weak first-quarter growth rate of real GDP would be revised\ndown and be a precursor to negative growth in the second quarter. Instead, not only was\nfirst-quarter growth revised up to just over 1 percent, but many forecasters now estimate\nthat second-quarter growth will be between 2 and 3 percent. That is quite a swing in the\noutlook. While this can only be interpreted as good news, I still expect sluggish\neconomic growth in the second half of this year and a further increase in the\nunemployment rate. The recent failure of IndyMac and the problems of Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac are the most recent events that have shaken confidence in our financial\ninstitutions and markets. This has raised the uncertainty surrounding forecasts for the\neconomy, including my own. As I have said before, and as these recent events\ndemonstrate, the road to recovery is likely to be a bumpy one.\n\nNevertheless, I continue to be generally more optimistic about 2009. As the housing\nmarket gradually completes its necessary adjustments and investors and the public regain\nconfidence in financial markets, economic growth should return to its long-run trend of\nabout 2¾ percent next year and the unemployment rate will gradually decline to about 5¼\npercent by the end of 2009.\n\nMy outlook is that headline personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation will\nremain near 4 percent in 2008, reflecting in part the increase in energy prices. I expect\ncore PCE inflation to be around 2½ percent this year.\n\nIn 2009, as energy and other commodity prices level off, I expect both measures of\ninflation to be lower — in the 2 to 2¼ percent range by the end of next year — provided\n\n\f6\nwe set monetary policy appropriately to restrain inflation and keep inflation expectations\nwell-anchored.\n\nInflation and Inflation Expectations\n\nAchieving inflation below 2 percent over the next couple of years depends critically on\nthe public’s inflation expectations remaining well-anchored. That is, households,\nworkers, businesses, investors, financial firms, all must have confidence that the Federal\nReserve will not let inflation get out of control, despite the recent persistent upward\npressure on headline inflation from energy and other commodity prices.\n\nWhy is this so important? Let me highlight the reason by drawing on the experience of\nthe latter half of the 1970s — a period when inflation expectations did, in fact, become\nunanchored. It is a bit of history we do not wish to repeat. During that time, the public\nsaw inflation rising relentlessly and concluded that the Federal Reserve was unable or\nunwilling to take the necessary steps to bring it under control.\n\nFearing that inflation would continue to rise, many suppliers to businesses began putting\nautomatic escalator clauses tied to various measures of inflation into their long-term\ncontracts. Workers, also fearing higher inflation, began demanding higher wages, and\nlabor contracts increasingly contained automatic cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs.\nFirms agreed to pay higher wages because they anticipated being able to pass along those\nhigher labor costs by raising the prices of their own products. This led to what some\neconomists call a wage-price spiral.\n\nI want to make clear that the rise in inflation expectations in the 1970s was not caused by\na wage-price spiral. That story has things backwards. The wage-price spiral was a\nconsequence of the inflation and the unanchoring of expectations of inflation, not the\nother way around. And the unanchoring of inflation expectations was caused by the\npublic’s loss of confidence in the Federal Reserve’s resolve to bring inflation back down.\nThe credibility of the Fed’s promise to deliver price stability was lost.\n\n\f7\n\nIn recent months I have heard some analysts suggest that the current economic situation\nis not like the 1970s because unions are less prevalent and there is no evidence as yet of a\nwage-price spiral. Thus, a weak economy, with rising unemployment and declining\npayroll employment, will presumably prevent workers from demanding higher wages.\nBut, again, that story has things backwards. It is not demands for higher wages that kick\noff the spiral, but the loss of confidence that the central bank will keep inflation\ncontrolled, which, in turn, leads to a rise in inflation expectations. The wage-price spiral\nis not the cause of the inflation, but the result.\n\nThis means that if monetary policymakers wait until they see the evidence of a wageprice spiral, they will be too late — the public will have lost confidence in the Fed’s\nability to keep inflation under control, and this will make the job of bringing inflation\ndown much more costly and difficult. Moreover, we could end up with a period of both\nlow economic growth and high inflation.\n\nI want to emphasize that what we have been seeing in the economy this past year, and in\nmy own outlook going forward, is very different from the 1970s, because I see the Fed as\ncommitted to keeping inflation expectations well-anchored. I agree with a statement Fed\nChairman Bernanke made in June that the Fed will strongly resist an erosion of longerterm inflation expectations, because an “unanchoring” of those expectations would be\ndestabilizing for economic growth as well as inflation.\n\nCore Versus Headline Inflation\n\nIn discussing how to make monetary policy decisions, many economists as well as\nmonetary policymakers have tended to focus on the behavior of core inflation rather than\nheadline inflation for several reasons. It is not because economists don’t eat or drive.\nMonetary policy does aim to control headline inflation over the intermediate to long run.\nThe question is, what is the best signal of that long-run underlying inflation rate — what\n\n\f8\nguide should policymakers use as they set policy today, knowing that it won’t have an\neffect on the economy until sometime in the future?\n\nSome economists focus on core inflation because a change in the relative price of a key\ncommodity, such as the rise in the price of oil, can affect near-term headline inflation but\nnot necessarily the longer-term trend of inflation. Historically, the prices of food or\nenergy have been quite volatile and at times have temporarily raised or lowered headline\nmeasures of inflation, only to settle down to more normal levels over time. Therefore, to\nhave monetary policy react to what may very well be a short-term deviation has usually\nbeen considered a mistake.\n\nOne drawback to this argument is that it is not clear why one should define “core” by\nexcluding just food and energy. While it is true that energy prices are particularly\nvolatile, the prices of other components (such as apparel) have been more volatile than\nfood prices. Thus, the argument for focusing on a measure that excludes the food and\nenergy components is less compelling. Moreover, over the last 10 years, headline and\ncore inflation have diverged by 40 to 50 basis points, and thus, the trend in core inflation\nhas not been a reliable indicator of the trend in headline inflation.\n\nAnother reason to focus on core inflation would be if core inflation did a better job of\nforecasting future headline inflation than headline inflation itself. Since policymakers\nmust be forward-looking in making policy decisions, such a forecasting ability would\nmean that we should monitor core rather than headline inflation.\n\nAlthough some empirical work on inflation forecasting has supported this view for\ncertain measures of inflation, recent research by our Philadelphia Fed staff suggests that\nmeasures of core inflation do not consistently outperform headline inflation in forecasting\nfuture headline inflation. 1 That research also finds that more accurate forecasts are\n\n1\n\nT.M. Crone, N.N.K. Khettry, L.J. Mester, and J.A. Novak, “Core Measures of Inflation as Predictors of\nTotal Inflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper 08-9, May 2008.\n\n\f9\nobtained by combining the CPI and PCE measures of inflation and that monitoring an\narray of inflation measures has merit.\n\nStill another argument for focusing on core inflation comes from economic theory. Some\neconomic models suggest that to achieve the best outcomes, monetary policy should try\nto stabilize the prices of goods and services that tend to be less flexible than those of\nenergy and commodities, which are traded in global markets and whose prices are\nadjusted frequently. Inflation in these less flexible prices — what economists call sticky\nprices — represents a more persistent part of underlying inflation. But the standard\nmeasure of core inflation contains components that would not necessarily correspond to\nthe goods and services in this sticky-price sector. And to the extent that changes in oil or\nother commodity prices seep into the prices of goods in this sector, the models suggest\npolicymakers would want to react.\n\nOne way such seepage could occur is via inflation expectations. When increases in\nenergy or food prices are persistent over a number of years, such continuous increases in\nheadline inflation get the public’s attention, even when measures of core inflation are\nbetter behaved. In such a situation, the public could very well start to wonder about what\nsuch ongoing increases in headline inflation mean for the longer-term trend of inflation\n— and whether the central bank will do anything to stop inflation from rising. If the\npublic loses confidence that the central bank will keep inflation low in the long run, then\ninflation expectations will begin to rise. Once that happens, the unanchoring of inflation\nexpectations will make it more difficult for the central bank to keep inflation low and\nstable or to bring inflation back down once it has risen.\n\nAlthough monetary policy has a responsibility to respond to the weakening of the\neconomy, this response must be consistent with the objective of restraining inflation.\nPolicymakers must be careful in responding to relative price changes that tend to reduce\neconomic activity while raising headline inflation. Monetary policy cannot control\nchanges in the relative price of a key commodity, like oil or food. But it can help ensure\nthat a relative price increase doesn’t turn into a rise in overall inflation Keep in mind\n\n\f10\nthat all sustained inflations begin with a change in relative prices. If policy becomes\noverly expansionary as it tries to address an economic slowdown, the relative price shock\nwill result in higher inflation. That was the mistake we made in the 1970s.\n\nSince energy price increases have been so persistent in recent years, I do believe more\nattention should now be paid to measures of headline inflation in setting monetary policy.\nI don’t believe we can be sanguine that the behavior of core inflation will keep the\npublic’s inflation expectations well-anchored in the face of persistently high headline\ninflation. To keep inflation expectations anchored means that monetary policymakers\nwill have to back up their words with action.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, this year and next will be quite challenging. The economy will grow this year\nbut at a slow pace, and the unemployment rate is likely to get worse before it gets better.\nAt the same time, inflation will be uncomfortably high for a while.\n\nI am more optimistic about the outlook for 2009 and I expect we will see economic\ngrowth return to near its longer-term trend. But to prevent recent inflation from\ncontinuing to plague the economy and to avoid a rise in inflation expectations, I believe\nthe current very accommodative stance of monetary policy will need to be reversed, and\ndepending on how economic conditions evolve, I anticipate that this reversal will likely\nneed to begin sooner rather than later.\n\nAs policymakers, we must remember that the path of inflation over some intermediate\nterm is not independent of our policy decisions. While monetary policy cannot control\nrelative price movements, sustained inflation is not something that is imposed on us. As\npolicymakers we have a choice. If we remain overly accommodative in the face of these\nlarge relative price shocks to energy and other commodities, we will ensure that they will\ntranslate into more broad-based inflation that — once ingrained in expectations — will be\n\n\f11\nvery difficult to undo. I believe we must and will take the appropriate steps to ensure that\ndoes not happen.\n\n\f"

Plosser, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nFor the Inaugural Conference of the Society for Financial Econometrics\nNew York University Stern School of Business\nNew York, NY\nJune 5, 2008\nIntroduction\nI am pleased and flattered to have been invited to speak to you today at your inaugural\nconference. Academic work, both theoretical and empirical, in financial econometrics has\nhad a tremendous impact on the form and structure of modern global financial markets. It has\npromoted both innovation and growth in an industry that is critical to the efficient allocation\nof capital and risk. Yet recent events have raised a number of questions about the stability\nand robustness of these complex markets and the role played by financial innovation. A more\nthorough understanding of such issues is important not only for researchers and market\nparticipants but for policymakers as well. In my remarks I would like to offer my perspective\non some of these issues and raise some questions whose answers might provide some useful\ninsight for policymakers and others in thinking about financial stability.\nThe functioning of financial markets has been a major focus of attention since last summer.\nThe turmoil we have witnessed was triggered by unexpectedly large losses on subprime\nmortgages issued in the U.S. over the last couple of years. Many, if not most, of these\nmortgages had been bundled into asset-backed securities and sold to investors in tranches,\npresumably reflecting different risk characteristics. When these securities began to sustain\nlosses in excess of those expected given the credit ratings they had been assigned, investors\nbegan to question the reliability of the ratings. While in many cases these complex assetbacked securities had been sold to a wide array of investors, their inherent complexity\nresulted in market participants. having a difficult time valuing them. This happened in part\nbecause the underlying default rates became highly uncertain, but also because it was\ndifficult to determine which institutions had exposure to these assets and to what degree.\nIndeed, the holdings have turned out to be more concentrated than many of us expected.\nNonetheless, investors pulled back and banks and other financial institutions found it difficult\nto sell these securities or use them as collateral to obtain funds in the short-term money\nmarkets. In general, we saw a rapid and substantial widening of risk spreads, and, in certain\nfinancial markets, trading either became extremely thin or completely shut down.\n\n\fThese events and the Federal Reserve's efforts to mitigate the financial disruptions that\nensued raise a long list of questions for policymakers and students of the financial markets.\nThe questions and proposed answers will no doubt be the subject of numerous studies by\nacademics and other interested observers. My hope is that some of you may find such\nquestions intriguing and your research will contribute to our understanding of them in an\neffort to improve policy.\nInnovation in Financial Markets\nBefore I discuss some issues that raise challenging questions for financial economists, I would\nlike to offer my perspective on the role of innovation in financial theory and practice.\nObservers have suggested that excessive innovation and new products in finance have been\nimportant contributors to the financial disruptions we have witnessed, implying that there is\na danger in too much innovation. I have a somewhat different perspective.\nDevelopments in finance theory and financial econometrics have played a critical role in\nspurring innovation and growth. Innovation in financial markets has led to substantial\ndeepening of global capital markets. For example, technical advances have made it possible\nto convert many assets that were relatively illiquid or non-tradable into newly created\ntradable securities. Theoretical and econometric techniques have enhanced the ability to\ndevelop and estimate sophisticated relative pricing models for a wide array of structured\nassets. In addition, financial innovation has generated greater efficiency in the allocation of\nrisks by breaking the links between origination and ownership and by creating securities that\nmore finely allocate risks to different investor classes.\nI believe the boom in financial market innovation and growth has undoubtedly generated\nefficiencies in the allocation of capital, lowered the cost of capital, and contributed to\neconomic growth worldwide. Nevertheless, not every innovation is successful. In markets for\nconsumer goods and services, or industrial goods, some new products fail. They fail to\nperform as anticipated or have adverse unforeseen consequences. In other words, they fail to\nmeet the market test. Some products just disappear, never to see the light of day again.\nOther products are refined or improved to meet the demands of the marketplace and thus\nreturn to the market in some modified form. Product failures, of course, can be costly to\ninvestors and customers alike. Yet winning and losing are important elements of a dynamic\nmarket-driven economy and efforts to stifle or limit the winning or losing will generally yield\nsub-optimal outcomes.\nI see innovation in the financial markets in a similar light. Financial engineering has enabled\nfirms to construct a wide variety of new “products” and instruments. However, just because a\nsecurity can be created does not guarantee that it can or will survive in the marketplace. I\n\n\fsuspect that many of the newly created products — for example, structured investment\nvehicles, or SIVs — may not return, or if they do, they will have a different form or contract\nstructure. The message is that financial innovation as a whole is beneficial to society and has\nimproved the functioning of our capital markets. That does not mean that every new\ninnovation will succeed, but that is the nature of progress and we should take care that\nregulation does not unnecessarily inhibit such innovation.\nHowever, the financial market spillovers from events in the subprime mortgage market do\nraise questions about potential weaknesses in our financial system. While I don. t know the\nanswers to many of the questions raised by these recent developments, let me highlight three\nquestions that are of interest to me and other policymakers and that many of you can help\naddress in your research.\n1. In assessing risk in financial models, how effective are current modeling methodologies\nin incorporating model error or model uncertainty? Specifically, have these models\nappropriately captured the implications for underlying statistical relationships of the\nimpacts of aggregate shocks?\n2. Do we have adequate tools and methodologies to stress test these models? This is\nparticularly challenging in the area of consumer credit portfolios and their\ndependence on expected loss distributions. [This is an area in which the Philadelphia\nFed's staff has a particular interest.]\n3. How should we evaluate the trade-off, if any, between undertaking policy\ninterventions aimed at combating short-run financial instability and the potential\nfinancial market distortions and moral hazard that could result from those\ninterventions?\nRobustness, Stress Testing, and Model Uncertainty\nIn discussing my first question, let me begin with some general observations about assessing\nrisk in financial models. As a bank regulator, the Federal Reserve gets a bird's-eye view of\nhow large financial institutions measure and manage their risk. For example, the Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia houses a group of experts who examine banks. risk models for\nconsumer credit portfolios — credit card loans, mortgages, auto loans, etc. This allows us to\nsee more clearly some of the strengths and weaknesses of the modeling approaches used at\nlarge, sophisticated banking organizations.\nThe complex risk models used by financial institutions to analyze portfolio risk provide the\nbasis for the pricing of derivative securities based on the returns from these assets. Most\ninvestors in the asset-backed securities markets probably know fairly little about the\nunderlying risk models or the strengths and weaknesses of those models. Of course, this\n\n\fsituation is not unique to newer financial instruments. Modern finance theory has developed\nvarious models of markets in which investors have different degrees of information and\ndifferent degrees of sophistication. So, perhaps there is little difference in some of these\nnewer markets.\nIt certainly could be the case, however, that where models are relatively new and complex,\ninvestor confidence in these underlying models may undergo substantial shifts. These shifts in\nconfidence could amplify the volatility generated by shocks to investors. views about the\nlikely realizations of stochastic state variables, such as interest rates or macroeconomic\nconditions. That is, when data reveal substantial departures from prior forecasts, it may be\ndifficult to untangle whether this outcome is a result of shifts in state variables or a result of\nmodeling errors, particularly when the underlying modeling apparatus is opaque.\nThe broad market reaction to the Enron bankruptcy in 2001 provides a parallel to this idea.\nWhy did the fall of Enron cause such disruption in the financial markets? The disruption was\nnot primarily a result of a change in market views about economic conditions, but rather it\nreflected a broad loss of confidence in the reliability of accounting statements. In the case of\nthe recent turmoil in financial markets, to what extent was this turmoil exacerbated by\ninvestors. loss of confidence in the ratings given by rating agencies to various tranches of\nasset-backed securities and derivative products? Clearly, investors. perception of the riskiness\nof a variety of securities changed in a short period of time. But it's not clear that current\nmodeling methodologies that incorporate such things as model error or model uncertainty\ncould have captured this sudden change in investors. confidence in modeling the risk\nassociated with these securities. Perhaps more attention must be focused on the potential for\ngreater volatility and even breakdowns in the underlying structures on which the pricing\nrelationships depend and exploring the types of shocks that might generate such outcomes.\nThe degree to which confidence in modeling approaches may be shaken depends in part on\nthe models. degree of transparency as well as the quality of the models that rating agencies\nand other financial institutions use to measure risk. While there have been enormous\nadvances in this type of modeling over the last two decades, there are still notable\nweaknesses. The Philadelphia Fed has focused on modeling consumer credit, so I. ll focus on\nmodeling in that sector — particularly mortgage risk modeling — in discussing my second\nquestion: How do you determine an appropriate method for stress testing the model\nparameters to take into account the uncertainty in parameter estimates?\nModeling Consumer Credit\n\n\fConsumer lenders use a host of sophisticated credit scoring techniques to assess borrower\nrisk. These models have proven extremely valuable in practice and have a significant track\nrecord. This modeling apparatus is geared primarily to forecasting expected losses. However,\nthe modeling of portfolio loss distributions in consumer credit is still relatively new. Models of\nportfolio loss distributions have applied concepts taken from developments in financial theory\nand practice, which emphasize the importance of modeling structures of correlations for\ndetermining portfolio risk. The models are primarily used for determining economic capital\nand measuring risk-adjusted returns. Increasingly, bank regulation is using this type of\nmodeling by incorporating these tools into the new international regulatory capital\nrequirements for banking firms, known as Basel II. Our staff at the Philadelphia Fed is\nresponsible for much of the Fed System's work on reviewing banks. Basel II models for\nconsumer credit.\nNevertheless, there are some difficult challenges in modeling higher moments of the risk\ndistribution of consumer credit portfolios. One of these challenges is the relatively short data\nhistories used by modelers. For example, many financial institutions built mortgage risk\nmodels based on proprietary data that did not span a very long time period. In many cases,\nthe models did not include data from the last housing recession of the early 1990s. While\nvarious longer data sources for mortgages exist, the internal proprietary data at banks are\nricher, and many firms believed that data from earlier periods would not be able to\nincorporate the very dramatic changes in the mortgage market over the last decade. One\nexample of this type of change is subprime lending, which was not a substantial factor in the\nlast housing recession in the early 1990s.\nThe relatively short history encompassing a period of strong housing markets generated\npotential weaknesses in the ability of mortgage models to incorporate the effects of a\nstressed housing market. While this problem was understood by experts working in the field,\nand there were attempts to measure the impact of stress on portfolio performance, this lack\nof a longer data series still posed a very difficult empirical problem. Obviously, in hindsight,\nit's clear that the market underestimated both the potential for a broad downturn in the\nhousing market and the impact this stress would have on losses in the mortgage market.\nWhile forecasting errors would likely have been lower if modelers had access to high-quality\ndata covering multiple housing cycles, these models have other potential sources of\nweakness. For example, portfolio credit risk models used in the market are reduced-form\nequations that look at the historical relationship between risk factors and outcomes. For\nreasons that have long been discussed by econometricians, this kind of reduced-form model\nmay perform poorly when there are significant structural or behavioral changes in the\neconomy.\n\n\fThere is some reason to believe that this type of structural shift did occur in mortgage\nmarkets. There is considerable evidence that rapid house price growth led to a substantial\nincrease in the investment or speculative motive for those “optimistic” home buyers who\nbelieved that prices would continue to rise. Such borrowers chose larger homes and higher\nleverage and were more likely to default when housing prices fell relative to past episodes of\nhouse price decline.\nThis phenomenon certainly existed in the past during periods of rapid house price\nappreciation, and it is possible that this phenomenon would be observed in models with\nlonger data histories. However, the recent boom in housing also occurred during a period of\nunprecedented expansion in the supply of consumer credit. Much of this expansion was\nfueled by the development of information technology. Lenders were able to store and analyze\nvast amounts of data on individual consumers and to estimate models of an individual's\ncreditworthiness using these data. To add to this overall trend in credit expansion, recent\nyears saw an unusually sharp decline in mortgage underwriting standards that further\nexpanded credit. While there are many suggestions as to the cause of these lower lending\nstandards, I think we do not yet have a clear understanding of why this occurred. In any\nevent, the broadening of consumer credit availability, the lowering of lending standards, and\npotential adverse selection problems during this housing market boom all contributed to the\nsituation we found ourselves in this past year.\nIn principle, analysts can attempt to incorporate model uncertainty into their risk assessment.\nHowever, this has been a difficult area and one that has probably not received sufficient\nattention. For example, when rating mortgage CDOs (collateralized debt obligations), the\nrating agencies would run their models through a stress scenario to determine an appropriate\nrating. However, the losses that occur in those models are quite sensitive to the estimated\ncorrelations in the model. In particular, structural or macroeconomic shocks can result in very\npoor forecasts from such reduced-form models. So this leads to the second question I posed at\nthe beginning: How do you determine an appropriate method to “stress” the model\nparameters to take into account the uncertainty in parameter estimates from such reducedform models?\nI have suggested that shifts in the degree of confidence in new and complex valuation models\nmight be a source of instability in financial markets. Therefore, improving these modeling\nmethodologies and increasing transparency, as well as obtaining better measures of model\nuncertainty, will be factors in improving the functioning of certain financial markets. The\nFederal Reserve and other banking regulators have been devoting more resources to looking\nat this modeling apparatus for the purpose of assessing bank risk management techniques.\nIncreasingly, we are also looking at these issues from the financial stability perspective. I\n\n\fbelieve that many of you could make great contributions in this arena, and we at the\nPhiladelphia Fed are certainly interested in maintaining a dialogue with researchers in these\nareas.\nWhile the sources and characteristics of financial instability have changed along with changes\nin our financial system, shocks to the financial system are not a new phenomenon. When they\ndo occur, there are often calls for the central bank to smooth out the volatility in the\nmarketplace and, in some cases, to prevent the failure of a major financial institution.\nIt is clear that the smooth functioning of financial markets is a central element of a modern\neconomy and is important for the achievement of central banks. objectives. However, it is\nless clear how to distinguish disruptions in the efficient functioning of financial markets that\ncall for central bank intervention from necessary market corrections to asset prices.\nDeveloping a clearer understanding of this distinction is critical for determining appropriate\npolicy and the appropriate tools of policy.\nMoral Hazard and Financial Stability\nIf a central bank's financial stabilization policy is designed simply to smooth out fluctuations\nin asset prices, it runs the risk of delaying necessary price adjustments and creating\nsubstantial inefficiencies in the marketplace. Financial stabilization policies, if misapplied,\ncan effectively subsidize risk-taking by systemically important financial institutions. Such\npolicies run the risk of increasing moral hazard and ultimately raise the risk of systemic\ninstability rather than lowering it. That brings me to my third question: How should we\nevaluate the trade-off, if any, between undertaking policy interventions aimed at combating\nshort-run financial instability and the potential financial market distortions and moral hazard\nthat could result from those interventions?\nWhen faced with such a situation, policymakers must evaluate the trade-offs based on the\nknowledge and evidence we have at the time. Improving our understanding of financial\nmarkets and the effects of financial market innovation will be important for improving the\nefficiency of those markets, and it will be very important to central bank policymakers\nthroughout the world.\nThe issues surrounding financial market instability raise important questions about how\nfinancial markets value assets as well as questions about the nature of liquidity. But as I have\nbeen suggesting, it also raises important questions about the role of the central bank in\nfostering financial stability. Indeed, the recent financial disruptions have led the Federal\nReserve to take some extraordinary measures to meet our central bank responsibility of\nensuring financial stability.\n\n\fThese events highlight a very important distinction between a central bank's responsibility for\nfinancial stability and its responsibility for monetary policy. These responsibilities are closely\nrelated, but clearly distinct.\nThe role of monetary policy is to ensure the stability of the purchasing power of the nation's\ncurrency so that markets are not distorted by inflation. The Federal Reserve is also charged\nwith supporting sustainable economic growth. I believe that maintaining price stability is the\nmost important contribution a central bank can make to promoting sustainable growth. To\npromote financial stability, central banks seek to ensure the smooth functioning of the\npayment system and the orderly functioning of the financial markets. Most important, this\nmeans taking actions that reduce the chances of contagion and systemic risk. Such actions\ngenerally fall into the category of the central bank's lender-of-last-resort function. These two\nresponsibilities — monetary policy and supporting financial stability — are related because in\nsome circumstances financial instability can have consequences for the broader economy and,\nconversely, macroeconomic conditions can sometimes have consequences for financial\nstability. However, because these two objectives are distinct, central banks will generally use\ndifferent tools, depending on their objectives.\nIn the U.S., the Federal Reserve's instrument for achieving its monetary policy objectives is,\nof course, the federal funds rate. In contrast, in attempting to promote financial stability\nduring the past year, the Fed has employed a variety of discount window lending\narrangements.\nJust as there are debates about potential trade-offs in monetary policy between short-run\nincreases in output and maintaining a credible commitment to low and stable inflation, there\nare debates about trade-offs between policy interventions aimed at combating short-run\nfinancial instability and the potential financial market distortions that could result from those\ninterventions. As I said earlier, policy interventions in financial markets run the risks of\nincreasing moral hazard and inhibiting efficient price discovery. Moreover, interventions\nintended to quell instability can, by creating moral hazard, actually make instability more\nsevere in the long run.\nFortunately, central banks do not have to act as a lender of last resort very often. However,\nrecent events suggest to me that we should review very carefully this responsibility in light of\nthe global developments and advances in the nature of our financial markets. How do we\ndefine an institution that is systemically important and therefore an appropriate candidate\nfor lender-of-last-resort loans from the central bank? What do we need to know about those\ninstitutions and their balance sheets in such circumstances? Do we need to know only the\nvalue of the collateral they post or something more? These are difficult questions, and I do\nnot pretend to know the answers.\n\n\fI do believe, however, that lender-of-last resort policies should take a lesson from what we\nhave learned from the theory of monetary policy. In particular, policy should have important\nrule-like features. Specifying in advance the conditions or states of the world under which the\ncentral bank will lend is an essential first step. But policy must also make credible\ncommitments to act in a systematic way consistent with explicit ex-ante guidelines.\nDiscretion in lending practices runs the risk of exacerbating moral hazard and encouraging\nfinancial institutions to take excessive amounts of risk. Nevertheless, the issue of trading off\nfinancial stability and moral hazard will likely remain. How to do that is a difficult and\nunresolved question. How should a policymaker evaluate such trade-offs? Are they\nquantifiable? I do not know the answers, but I do know that coming to grips with such\nquestions is important for policymakers. calculus.\nSummary\nIn closing, I look forward to the results of your research efforts. I hope that over time your\nwork will help answer some of the questions I posed, as well as some of the many other\nrelated questions raised by the extraordinary events since last August. I know that a number\nof our staff members at the Philadelphia Fed have a great interest in seeing the results of\nyour ongoing efforts to model and understand the complex elements of our financial markets.\n\n\f"

            "content": "Monetary Policy and Financial Stability\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nThe 26th Annual Monetary and Trade Conference\nPresented by:\nThe Global Interdependence Center and Drexel’s LeBow College of Business\nApril 18, 2008\n\nA couple of days ago I thought my role at this conference would be to introduce my old\nfriend and now former colleague Bill Poole. Bill was unable to be here and David Kotok\nasked me a couple of days ago if I could modify my introduction slightly to discuss\nmonetary policy and the turmoil in the credit markets. I suggested that it would have to\nbe a little more than a slight modification and it would be difficult to fill Bill’s shoes, but\nthat I would do the best I could on short notice.\nBefore I go any further, I should mention that the usual disclaimer applies. My remarks\nreflect my views and are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my\ncolleagues on the FOMC.\nAs I mentioned, I have been asked to discuss monetary policy’s response to the turmoil in\nfinancial markets. To begin I would like to make a distinction between a central bank’s\nresponsibility for monetary policy and its responsibility for financial stability. I view\nthese responsibilities as related but different, and I think it is important and useful to\nthink about them in that manner.\n\nThe role of monetary policy is to ensure the stability of the purchasing power of the\nnation’s currency so that markets are not distorted by inflation. In the U.S. we also are\ncharged with supporting sustainable economic growth. I believe, along with many other\neconomists, that maintaining price stability is one of the most important contributions a\ncentral bank can make to promoting sustainable growth. To promote financial stability,\n\n1\n\n\fcentral banks seek to ensure the smooth functioning of the payment system and the\norderly functioning of the financial markets.\n\nThese two responsibilities, monetary policy and financial stability, are related but\ndifferent and sometimes call for central banks to use different tools depending on their\nobjectives. They are related because in some circumstances financial instability can have\nconsequences for the broader economy and, by like token, macroeconomic conditions can\nsometimes have consequences for financial stability.\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the problems that developed in the housing sector and the\nsubprime mortgage market in 2007, along with further increases in the price of oil, led to\nsuccessive downward revisions in the outlook for the economy. As the outlook for the\neconomy deteriorated, the Federal Reserve reduced the target for the federal funds rate in\na series of steps by 300 basis points — from 5.25 percent in early September to its current\nlevel of 2.25 percent. Taking expected inflation into account, the level of the federal\nfunds rate in real terms — what economists call the real rate of interest — is now\nnegative. The last time the level of real interest rates was this low was in 2003-2004. But\nthat was a different time with a different concern — deflation — and monetary policy\nwas intentionally seeking to prevent prices from falling. Recently, we have had reason to\nbe worried about rising inflation, not declining prices. Thus, comparing the nominal\nfunds rate today with the stance of policy in 2003–2004 is like comparing apples and\noranges.\n\nWe must keep in mind that monetary policy works with a lag. The full impact of changes\nin monetary policy on output and employment may not materialize for several quarters at\nthe earliest. This lagged response means that monetary policy decisions depend critically\non the outlook for the economy over the intermediate term. In times of economic\nturbulence and uncertainty, forecasting becomes more difficult. That does not mean that\nyou can stop forecasting, but it does mean that the uncertainty surrounding any forecast\nwill be unusually large.\n\n2\n\n\fThis weakening in economic fundamentals began with a decline in the demand for\nhousing after a number of years of rapid expansion and rising prices. This, in and of\nitself, need not have been anything extraordinary. What to my mind changed the picture\nwas the confounding impact of the increasing defaults, primarily in the subprime\nmortgage market. House prices actually began their deceleration in 2005. In 2007, the\nconcerns about the nature of the mortgage contracts in the subprime arena became\napparent as default rates on these mortgages began to rise more than expected, further\nexacerbating the decline in house prices.\n\nThe rise in defaults began to reveal serious flaws in the pricing and risk assessments of a\nvariety of structured instruments in the financial market which had been built around the\ngrowing market for subprime lending. Market participants began to have serious doubts\nabout the value of these instruments and products. The assumed default rates that\ndetermined their original rating and valuation seemed to fly out the window, and no one\nknew what the new price or valuation should be. Moreover, the securitization process\nresulted in the repackaging of these loans into securities of various risk classes, which\nwere then sold to different investors. The result was a lack of transparency regarding who\nheld how much of what were now suspect securities. Thus, market participants faced a\nvery complex two-part problem: how to value the underlying securities and who held\nthem.\n\nProblems in the subprime mortgage market spilled over to other markets and resulted in\nmore widespread impairment of the funding markets for many types of firms — both\nfinancial and nonfinancial — thereby disrupting the effective functioning of financial\nmarkets. Some interest rate spreads remain high, and financial capital has taken serious\nhits at a number of institutions. The current turmoil in financial markets has led to a\ntightening of credit that has affected the broader economy and has the potential to\ncontinue to restrain economic growth going forward. The risk that the financial turmoil\ncould become more severe and further adversely affect the functioning of financial\nmarkets suggests to some that short-term interest rates need to be lower than they would\n\n3\n\n\fbe otherwise in order to provide a form of insurance. However, determining the\nappropriate extent of such extra accommodation is difficult to quantify.\n\nIn any case, the bottom line is that, on the monetary policy front, the Fed’s response to\nthe deterioration of the economic outlook and the turmoil in financial markets has\nresulted in an accommodative level of real interest rates that should support the market\nforces that will bring economic growth back toward its long-term trend.\n\nNevertheless, the turmoil in the financial markets and the liquidity problems that arose in\ncertain markets raised concerns from the perspective of the Federal Reserve’s\nresponsibility for financial stability.\n\nOn the financial stability front, the Federal Reserve applied a different set of tools to\nprovide additional liquidity to financial markets to try to improve their ability to function\nsmoothly. These steps included lowering the discount rate, narrowing its spread to the\ntarget fed funds rate, and extending the term of discount window loans. In addition, the\nFed established three new types of lending facilities:\n the Term Auction Facility (TAF): to auction longer-term loans to banks;\n the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF): to auction loans of our own\nholdings of Treasury securities in exchange for various types of non-Treasury\nsecurities that we then hold as collateral;\n and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF): to make collateralized loans\ndirectly to primary securities dealers.\nFinally, the Fed took special steps so that the collapse of Bear Stearns would not cause\nserious disruptions to other financial institutions and their customers. All of these actions\nfall under the central bank’s responsibility for ensuring financial stability and reflect the\nFed’s role as lender of last resort. It is important to recognize that these actions are not\nwhat I would call monetary policy, in the sense that they are not designed to alter the\nFOMC’s target for the fed funds rate. They are intended to support the liquidity and\nsmooth functioning of the short-term funding markets. Indeed, in each case, to the extent\n\n4\n\n\fthat additional reserves were added to the banking system, they were sterilized through\nopen market operations. That is, they did not add new reserves independent of the\ndecisions made regarding the fed funds rate target.\n\nHowever, the recent financial turmoil has also surfaced problems regarding subprime\nmortgages and certain other financial practices that have also raised issues about the\nability of existing financial regulations to protect consumers. Consequently, on the\nfinancial regulation front, the Fed has proposed new rules (under the Home Owners\nEquity Protection Act, or HOEPA) to strengthen oversight and prevent abusive lending\npractices in order to help consumers in the future. Significantly, these rules will apply to\nthe entire mortgage industry, not just those institutions directly regulated by the Federal\nReserve. The Federal Reserve Board also continues to work toward more effective\nconsumer disclosure rules and will be doing extensive consumer testing to ensure that\nproposed new disclosures are comprehensible to borrowers. Changes to the Truth in\nLending Act are being proposed that will require earlier disclosures by lenders and\naddress concerns about misleading mortgage loan advertisements.\n\nIn addition to proposing changes in regulations to help consumers in the future, the Fed\nhas also been concerned about helping consumers today who are at risk of losing their\nhomes to foreclosure. Consequently, on the foreclosure front, the Federal Reserve, along\nwith the other federal financial regulators, has worked to guide federally supervised\ninstitutions as they deal with mortgage defaults and delinquencies. The federal regulatory\nagencies, along with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, have encouraged lenders\nto work proactively with borrowers who may be facing delinquency or foreclosure. We\nhave also encouraged servicers of securitized residential mortgages to determine what\nthey can do to restructure failing loans and to pursue appropriate strategies for mitigating\nlosses on such loans.\n\nIn February the Philadelphia Fed’s Community Affairs Department hosted a meeting for\n180 housing counselors from the Third District and seven of the top 10 national subprime\nloan servicers. The purpose was to open the lines of communication between housing\n\n5\n\n\fcounselors and mortgage loan servicers so they could find ways to modify or refinance\ndelinquent loans to avoid having people’s homes go into foreclosure.\nFinally, on the economic and financial education front, a number of Fed officials,\nincluding me, have stressed the importance of enhancing financial literacy so that\nconsumers have more information and are able to make better decisions regarding their\nown financial well-being. In my view, the current economic environment and recent\nfinancial turmoil underscore the need for improved economic and financial literacy. I am\nnot the first, nor will I be the last, to make this plea. But our current economic and\nfinancial situation has reinforced my sense of urgency in this regard.\n\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve has been acting on several fronts to address the recent\nturmoil in financial markets. Some of those actions are intended to stem the immediate\nproblems. Others are intended to have longer-term benefits in helping to prevent future\nfinancial problems. But let me also add some words of caution about expecting more\nfrom the Fed than it has the ability to deliver.\n\nI think it is particularly important, for example, to recognize that monetary policy cannot\nsolve all the problems the economy and financial system now face. It cannot solve the\nbad debt problems in the mortgage market. It cannot re-price the risks of securities\nbacked by subprime loans. It cannot solve the problems faced by those financial firms at\nrisk of being given lower ratings by rating agencies because some of their assets are now\nworth much less than previously thought. The markets will have to solve these problems,\nas indeed they will. But it will take some time.\n\nUnfortunately, the public perception of what monetary policy is capable of achieving\nseems to have risen considerably over the years. Indeed, there seems to be a view that\nmonetary policy is the solution to most, if not all, economic ills. Not only is this not true,\nit is a dangerous misconception and runs the risk of setting up expectations that monetary\npolicy can achieve objectives it cannot attain. To ensure the credibility of monetary\npolicy, we should never ask monetary policy to do more than it can do.\n\n6\n\n\fThe same could be said of the Fed’s lender of last resort function. All of the special\nlending facilities I described can be interpreted as part of that responsibility.\nTraditionally, in times of financial crisis, a central bank is supposed to lend freely at a\npenalty rate against good collateral. The experience of the past nine months suggests to\nme that we need to better understand how to apply this lender of last resort maxim in the\ncontext of today’s financial environment. Walter Bagehot’s words from the 1870s were\napplicable to a banking and financial system that did not have today’s complexity.\nClearly, our objective today is the same as it was in Bagehot’s day — to stem systemic\nrisk. But how to implement that principle in today’s world needs to be given some serious\nthought. But such rethinking is best done not in the heat of a crisis, but after things have\ncooled down and we have had time to reflect on what we have learned from the crisis.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has responded to the turmoil in financial markets on several fronts\nwith tools designed to address specific problems. But the challenges we have faced raise\na myriad of questions that we must address going forward. The answers are neither easy\nnor obvious, and we must be careful in our approach to solutions to avoid creating more\nproblems than we solve. A critical element of any solution rests in the ability to\ncommunicate effectively the underlying objectives of policy choices and the means by\nwhich we will achieve them. No easy task to be sure, but I am confident that we can meet\nthis challenge to promote an efficient and effective environment for continued prosperity.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here at Montgomery County Community College.\nAs someone who has spent over three decades in the teaching profession, I firmly believe\nthat education is one of the most important investments an individual can make. It is also\ncritical for the long-term health and prosperity of our nation. Today I would like to spend\nmy time with you discussing the links between education and economic well-being both\nfor the individual and society as a whole — a topic that has particular relevance given the\ncurrent economic and financial environment.\n\nMost of you in this room understand the value of education both to you and to the\nbusinesses where you currently work or may work in the future. A skilled workforce is\nessential to a business’s success. Those skills, however, are not just learned through\ntraditional classroom study but are acquired through experience and learning by doing.\nMore broadly, we can think of skills as encompassing not only communication and\nanalytical abilities but also traits such as perseverance and pride in doing a job to the best\nof one’s ability. Thus, education from this point of view is multi-faceted, extending well\nbeyond the classroom, and should be a life-long endeavor for everyone. Such skills,\ntraits, and values can be viewed as components of what economists call human capital.\n\nEconomists have long emphasized the importance of human capital for economic growth\nand prosperity. Economic prosperity is generally measured in terms of living standards,\nand the improvement in living standards is closely linked to the growth in the\nproductivity of labor, that is, how much is produced per hour of work. In order to\nimprove living standards, the productivity of individuals in a society must increase.\n1\n\n\fEducation affects productivity in two critical ways. First, education supports innovation\nthat creates new technologies, which, in turn, enhance the productivity of workers in the\neconomy. Second, education improves workers’ skills, which allow them not only to use\nnew technologies but also to use existing technology more effectively or efficiently.\nThus, education, I believe, is at the heart of productivity improvements and thus at the\ncenter of how we achieve increases in economic prosperity.\n\nEducation and Technological Progress\nOne way that education improves productivity is through research and development,\nwhich contributes to innovations and new technologies that improve our standard of\nliving and the quality of our lives. We have seen this play out in the innovations of the\npast two decades. Advances in information and communications technology have had\ndramatic effects on the U.S. economy and how people live and work. Many of you were\nborn during this era of innovation, and technology is an inherent and ingrained part of\nyour daily lives. When I went to college, a student perhaps took a record player and a\ntypewriter; if you were fortunate, the typewriter may have even been electric. But\ncommunications between us and home, usually to ask for money, would have been\nthrough letters we mailed home or a pay telephone in a hallway that was shared with the\nrest of the students in the dorm. Of course, today most of you students arrive with your\nown iPods, laptops, and cell phones, and communication is through e-mail, instant\nmessaging, and text messages using your cell phone — which I am sure you never do\nduring class.\n\nBut technological progress and innovation occur in all fields. We have seen great strides\nin the development of drugs and medical procedures that improve our health. We also\nhave seen innovation and productivity gains in service industries. Innovation in financial\nservices has changed how firms and individuals use and access the financial marketplace.\nElectronic payments, improved access to credit, and new products that distribute risk and\nimprove the efficiency of financial markets are widespread. These innovations lower\ncosts and expand opportunities for individuals and firms. If the truth be known, I am not\n\n2\n\n\fsure any of my children have ever been inside a bank, even though they use banking\nservices.\n\nAll this means is that when my children needed money, they sent me a text message or email and expected me to electronically deposit money into their account for access the\nnext day. Of course, although my ability to undertake these steps has become more\nefficient, it is less clear that I am more willing to act so promptly.\n\nEducation plays a vital role in the development of these advances. First, our nation’s\ncolleges and universities train many of the scientists and engineers who develop the\ntechnologies that underlie these new products and innovations. Second, and I will return\nto this point shortly, education helps to teach individuals the skills necessary to use and\ntake advantage of new technologies.\n\nEconomists have been studying productivity for a long time, and I don’t intend to\nsummarize all of that work for you today. But research has underscored the importance of\ninnovation and education in raising productivity growth.\n\nA 2001 study of 16 OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)\ncountries — including the U.S., Canada, Japan, and 13 European countries — examined\nthe effects on productivity growth of research and development — or R&D — spending\nof various types, including domestic businesses’ R&D, foreign R&D, and government\nand university R&D. Overall, this study of OECD countries underscores the importance\nof R&D for productivity growth and thus economic growth. 1\n\nInterestingly, this study found the effects of education on productivity growth to be\nconsiderable. The effect of university R&D spending on productivity growth was\nparticularly significant. The authors of the study attribute this to the fact that universities\n\n1\n\nD. Guellec and B. van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, “R&D and Productivity Growth: Panel Data Analysis\nof 16 OECD Countries,” OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers 2001/3, OECD\nPublishing (2001).\n\n3\n\n\fprovide basic knowledge to industries — knowledge that is then used to make\ntechnological innovations.\n\nIn addition, higher levels of education have been shown to help drive innovations that\nraise productivity. Because innovations can ultimately raise productivity growth, it is\nhelpful to know what factors are important in driving innovative activity. Research\nconducted by Philadelphia Reserve Bank economists examines this issue by investigating\nthe relationship between inventive output — as measured by patents per capita — and a\nvariety of inputs for a cross-section of about 280 U.S. cities in the 1990s. The inputs\nincluded private R&D, academic R&D, and other government-supported R&D, as well as\nhuman capital. 2\n\nI want to highlight the most important finding from that research. In this study, the\npercent of the population with a college education made the largest contribution to raising\nthe number of patents per capita in a metro area. This is what we call a “knowledge\neconomy.” Highly trained and highly skilled workers are critical, not only to their\nindividual success but also to the inventiveness and productivity of the economy as a\nwhole.\n\nThe authors suggest that their findings tell us something about how policymakers\ninterested in promoting the growth of innovation should order their priorities. The\nmessage is, work first on developing, attracting, and retaining an educated labor force for\nthe community — nothing is more critical for innovation and inventive activity. Second,\nencourage and support research and development in the private sector and the academic\ncommunity.\n\nThis research shows that higher productivity — and therefore higher living standards —\nis positively related to a more highly educated population.\n\n2\n\nSee Gerald Carlino, Satyajit Chatterjee, and Robert Hunt, “Urban Density and the Rate of Invention,”\nJournal of Urban Economics (2007), pp. 389-419.\n\n4\n\n\fThe Returns to Education\nEducation and the skills learned in our colleges and universities not only contribute to\nproductivity through the innovations and technologies they foster, but they equip\nindividuals with the tools and skills to use new technology in ways that make the\nindividual more productive. This is important, since more productive individuals earn\nmore.\n\nThe direct benefit to the individual from education is substantial. According to Bureau of\nLabor Statistics data, the median weekly earnings of college graduates in 2007 were 77\npercent higher than the earnings of those with only a high-school diploma. 3 Moreover,\nthis premium for a college education is growing. Just 10 years ago, college graduates\nearned only 69 percent more than their high-school counterparts. Of course, for those that\ndo not have a high-school diploma, the earnings disparity is even greater. Individuals\nwith at least a college degree have median incomes more than 150 percent higher than\nthose without a high-school diploma. Not only do individuals’ earnings rise with their\ninvestment in education, but the unemployment rate for the more highly educated is\nsignificantly lower as well.\n\nThe growing earnings gap between those individuals with more education and training\nand those without has other important implications. 4 By almost any metric one can find,\nliving standards for the average American have improved significantly over time. Yet it is\ngenerally acknowledged that income inequality has also increased. This phenomenon is\nnot recent; it has been going on for some time. One of the most important contributors to\nthis increase in inequality is the growing premium for the more highly skilled. Advances\nin technology require a more highly skilled workforce, and so the rewards to those with\nthe requisite skills have been growing. This has been an important contributor to the\nincreases in income inequality. Improved education and other investments in human\n\n3\n\nSee Bureau of Labor Statistics, Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers: Fourth Quarter\n2007 and earlier.\n\n4\n\nSee Keith Sill’s article, “Widening the Wage Gap: The Skill Premium and Technology,” Federal Reserve\nBank of Philadelphia, Business Review, Fourth Quarter 2002, pp. 25-32.\n\n5\n\n\fcapital for more of our nation’s people are thus critical ingredients in eventually reducing\nthis inequality.\n\nEnhancing the skills and thus the productivity of individuals in our society also makes us\nbetter able to meet the demands of a more globalized economy. The U.S. and the world\nhave greatly benefited from the expansion of trade and the improved economic conditions\nof developing countries. Growth in countries like China and India expand the markets for\nU.S. products while also offering the U.S. consumer a greater variety of products at lower\ncosts. U.S. workers are, on average, among the most highly paid in the world. That can be\nsustained only if they remain among the most highly productive and highly skilled\nworkers in the world. If the U.S. is to capitalize on the benefits of globalization, investing\nin a more educated and a more flexible workforce is essential. Economic development\nand economic growth around the world will not stand still. Thus, we must adapt and\nenhance the skills and productivity of our workforce to meet this new and challenging\nenvironment.\n\nThe demand for more highly skilled workers continues to grow and the rewards are also\ngrowing. And it is more evident than ever that investment in human capital pays off, both\nfor the individual and for society more broadly.\n\nEconomics and Education\nBecause education has such a positive and lasting impact on our economy, it is important\nto ensure that our educational institutions are up to the task. Here in the U.S., our many\nhigh-quality universities and colleges have made higher education an export industry.\nOur universities and colleges are among the best in the world. Unfortunately, the same\ncannot always be said for our primary and secondary educational systems.\n\nMany of our high-school students languish at too low a level of skill and leave school\ninadequately prepared. And the technical knowledge our students obtain in our primary\nand secondary education systems does not stand up very well to international\ncomparisons. For example, in the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science\n\n6\n\n\fStudy, conducted in 2003, among the 45 countries participating, the U.S ranked 15th in\nmathematics and 9th in science. 5\n\nThe result has been an excess supply of labor into the slower-growing or declining areas\nof our economy. We apparently have quite a distance to go before we catch up to other\ncountries in technical training, including math and science, at the elementary and highschool level.\n\nTo exacerbate matters, the speed of change in our knowledge-based economy also means\nfaster depreciation of workers’ skill sets. To succeed, our educational systems must not\nonly train future workers for today’s environment but also arm them with the tools and\nresources to continually upgrade their skills. Education is not a one-time event. Life-long\nlearning is a necessity in today’s rapidly changing world. That means providing students\nwith both the desire and the tools to continue their education. To do so, our educational\nsystems must focus more attention on developing students’ decision-making and\nproblem-solving skills along with analytical abilities and communication skills.\nIt seems clear that our school systems need to better respond to the changing economy.\n\nWe succeeded in responding to this type of challenge in the past. In the early 20th\ncentury — a time when the nation was fostering a rapidly developing manufacturing\nsector — the educational system took on the responsibility of broadening the skills of\nstudents to meet the needs of a growing economy. High-school enrollment rose rapidly,\nand graduates entered the workforce better skilled and prepared with the training\nnecessary for success in many occupations of the day. 6\n\nToday, as in the past, we need to be forward looking to adapt our educational system to\nthe evolving needs of the economy and our changing society. We must work to provide\ngraduates with the education needed to meet the realities of today’s and tomorrow’s\n5\n\nSee the National Center for Education Statistics, http://nces.ed.gov/timss/index.asp.\n\n6\n\n“The Critical Role of Education in the Nation’s Economy,” remarks by Alan Greenspan at the Greater\nOmaha Chamber of Commerce 2004 Annual Meeting, Omaha, Nebraska, February 20, 2004.\n\n7\n\n\fmarketplace. Those efforts will require the collaboration of policymakers and educators.\nBut if such efforts are successful, we can ensure a more productive, highly skilled,\ntechnically trained workforce that will support a vibrant and robust economy in our\nregion and the nation.\n\nEconomic Education and Financial Literacy in the Current Economic Environment\nThe current economic environment underlines not just the importance of education but\nthe need for improved economic and financial literacy. I am not the first, nor will I be the\nlast, to make this plea. As an economist, I have a particular interest in economic and\nfinancial education. The events of the last decade, as well as our current economic and\nfinancial situation, have reinforced my sense of urgency in this regard.\n\nTechnological progress is not confined to computers and manufacturing or to science and\nmedicine. The financial world has witnessed tremendous innovation during the last 25\nyears. We have seen new products and new opportunities for businesses and individuals\nto manage their financial affairs and give them access to opportunities they never had\nbefore.\n\nYet with these innovations have come challenges. The development of the subprime\nmortgage market and the securitization of mortgages have made homeownership a reality\nfor many individuals and families who might otherwise never have been able to afford a\nhome. More low- and moderate-income families were able to obtain credit for both home\npurchases and home improvements. Yet as with any new product, some consumers\nbought products that were not suitable to their circumstances. They borrowed more than\nthey could afford; took risks they were unable to bear; or entered into agreements they\ndid not understand. In making these choices they were sometimes misled by abusive\nlending practices that rendered the terms and conditions of the loan agreements they\nsigned far from transparent.\n\nThe consequences of these choices are now all too apparent. Mortgage delinquencies and\nforeclosures have risen rapidly. Many individuals and families have already suffered the\n\n8\n\n\floss of their homes, and many other families are suffering from anxieties about whether\nthey will be able to continue to afford to remain in their homes. The housing industry and\nthe economy as a whole are also suffering.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I expect studies by analysts, financial institutions,\nacademics, and policymakers (including the Federal Reserve) will eventually come up\nwith a number of “lessons learned” that will help us understand what we might have done\ndifferently that could have kept us from getting to where we are today. What I hope is\nnot lost in such analyses of “lessons learned” is that this episode should be a lesson in the\nimportance of economic education — that both consumers and businesses would be\nbetter served if financial literacy were a greater priority.\n\nTo address the economic and financial situation that has developed, the Federal Reserve\nhas been working on multiple fronts. Let me briefly summarize what the Fed has been\ndoing on a number of these fronts, including monetary policy, financial stability,\nfinancial regulation, foreclosures, and economic and financial education.\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the problems that developed in the housing sector and the\nsubprime mortgage market in 2007, along with further increases in the price of oil, led to\nsuccessive downward revisions in the outlook for the economy. As the outlook for the\neconomy deteriorated, the Federal Reserve reduced the target for its policy interest rate\ninstrument, the federal funds rate, in a series of steps — from 5.25 percent in early\nSeptember to its current level of 2.25 percent.\n\nOn the financial stability front, problems in the subprime mortgage market eventually\nspilled over to other markets and resulted in more widespread impairment of the effective\nfunctioning of financial markets. As a result, the Federal Reserve also took a number of\ninnovative actions to provide additional liquidity to financial markets, in particular by\nestablishing three new types of lending facilities as alternative sources of funding for\nbanks and other financial firms. The Fed also took special steps to avoid allowing the\ncollapse of the Bear Stearns investment bank from causing serious disruptions to other\n\n9\n\n\ffinancial institutions and their customers. All of these actions fall under the central\nbank’s responsibility for ensuring financial stability.\n\nOn the financial regulation front, the Fed has proposed new rules (under the Home\nOwners Equity Protection Act, or HOEPA) to strengthen oversight and prevent abusive\nlending practices in order to help consumers in the future. Significantly, these rules will\napply to the entire mortgage industry, not just those institutions directly regulated by the\nFederal Reserve. The Federal Reserve Board also continues to work toward more\neffective consumer disclosure rules and will be doing extensive consumer testing to\nensure that proposed new disclosures are comprehensible to borrowers. Changes to the\nTruth in Lending Act are being proposed that will require earlier disclosures by lenders\nand address concerns about misleading mortgage loan advertisements.\n\nOn the foreclosure front, the Federal Reserve, along with the other federal financial\nregulators, has worked to guide federally supervised institutions as they deal with\nmortgage defaults and delinquencies. The federal regulatory agencies, along with the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors, have encouraged lenders to work proactively with\nborrowers who may be facing delinquency or foreclosure. We have also encouraged\nservicers of securitized residential mortgages to determine what they can do to restructure\nfailing loans and to pursue appropriate strategies for mitigating losses on such loans. The\nFederal Reserve continues to encourage servicers and investors to make every effort to\nkeep troubled borrowers in their homes.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board and all 12 Reserve Banks have also been working with\nfinancial institutions and community groups around the country to address challenges\nposed by loan performance and foreclosure problems. Using mapping software, we have\ntried to help identify those communities around the country that are most at risk of having\na high number of foreclosures to help local groups better focus their outreach efforts to\nborrowers. 7 The Fed has also been working with Hope Now, an alliance of loan servicers\nand housing counselors, to prevent foreclosures.\n7\n\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/mortgagemaps/.\n\n10\n\n\fIn February the Philadelphia Fed’s Community Affairs Department hosted a meeting for\n180 housing counselors from the Third District and seven of the top 10 national subprime\nloan servicers. The purpose was to open the lines of communication between housing\ncounselors and mortgage loan servicers so they could find ways to modify or refinance\ndelinquent loans to avoid having people’s homes go into foreclosure.\nReturning to my theme of economic and financial education, we believe it is important to\nenhance financial literacy so that consumers have more information and are able to make\nbetter decisions regarding their own financial well-being. One way we are doing our part\nis by actively promoting economic education and financial literacy in our schools. As\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke recently noted, today only eight states in the U.S. require\nstudents to take a personal finance course before middle-school or high-school\ngraduation. Although some schools offer elective courses in personal finance, statistics\nindicate that only 21 percent of students between the ages of 16 and 22 say they have\nexposure to personal finance courses in school. Most high-school graduates enter the\nworkforce ill-prepared to understand how our economy and financial system work or how\nto deal with the credit card offers they receive the first week of college.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s economic and financial education programs can help increase\nfinancial literacy. Each of the 12 Reserve Banks as well as their branches has at least one\neconomic education specialist. Many of these specialists offer training seminars to help\neducators teach economic and personal finance topics in their classrooms. The Fed also\nhas an education web portal offering easy access to a host of beneficial resources geared\nto students, parents, and teachers. 8\n\nOur own Philadelphia Reserve Bank offers teacher-training programs that provide\nknowledge and resources to teachers so they can get the right message to students. The\nPhiladelphia Fed worked with the University of Delaware’s Center for Economic\nEducation and Entrepreneurship to develop an elective financial education curriculum\nthat has been successful in many regional high schools. From one pilot program at one\n8\n\nFederalReserveEducation.org\n\n11\n\n\fDelaware high school in the 2001-2002 school year, today nearly all of the 31 public high\nschools in Delaware are offering this program, along with a number of private and\nparochial schools. We have recently introduced the program into the other two states of\nour Fed District, and it is now offered in 45 schools in Pennsylvania and eight in New\nJersey.\n\nWe know that broad-based economic and financial education initiatives for students will\ntranslate into a society of more financially literate adults. Economic education gives\npeople the building blocks for a successful financial future. It imparts the knowledge and\ntools to improve people’s economic well-being. In this way, it can have a powerful\ninfluence on the future health of our nation’s economy and should help families avoid\ngetting into the types of subprime lending problems we are experiencing today.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, education is critical to the long-run well-being of our economy and\neveryone who participates in it. It enhances our productivity and raises living standards.\nIt enables consumers and businesses to make more informed and thus better decisions\nand choices — improving the broader economy in the process. But the responsibility does\nnot rest solely with government and policymakers, who clearly must do their part. It rests\nmostly on individuals taking the responsibility to engage in life-long learning, making\ninvestments that will reward them handsomely. I commend you — as students, teachers,\nand citizens — for your efforts and for the investments you are making. Both you and our\neconomy will be better for it.\n\n12\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nLet me thank the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to participate in this very\ninteresting program. I also want to thank the South African Reserve Bank as well as the\nother central banks represented here for their participation. The theory and practice of\ncentral banking have come a long way in the last three decades. But there is still a lot to\nlearn and new challenges are, it seems, always emerging. One of the great benefits of\nconferences like this one is to learn from others and share our thoughts so that best\npractices can emerge.\nIn my remarks today I want to focus attention on some of the principles that I believe\nmake for sound and effective central banking. I believe that adhering to these principles\ncan enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in these challenging times. In doing so,\nI will also share my personal views about some of the specific ways these principles can\nbe implemented, although I recognize that implementation may vary among central\nbanks.\nOne of the most significant developments in economic theory during the last quarter of\nthe 20th century was the recognition of the importance of expectations in understanding\neconomic behavior. Expectations of the future play an important role in the decisions of\nboth households and businesses as they make their economic choices. This is particularly\nevident in financial markets, where expectations of the future play a role not only in\ninvestment decisions but also in the valuation of securities. Of course, to the extent that\nthey are important for economic outcomes, expectations of future monetary policy\ndecisions will be important as well, particularly as they pertain to the future path of\ninflation. Thus, monetary policymakers must make decisions with the understanding that\nthose decisions may affect the public’s expectation of future decisions — which in turn\nwill affect the choices market participants make today.\nThe recognition of the important role played by expectations leads me to focus on four\nmain principles of sound monetary policy that I would like to touch on today.\n\n\f•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe first principle is that a central bank should make a commitment to wellarticulated and achievable objectives.\nThe second principle is that a central bank should seek ways to make that\ncommitment credible.\nThe third principle is that the central bank should be transparent in its\ncommunications.\nThe fourth principle is that a central bank should set monetary policy with a\ngreat deal of independence from the fiscal authority. This is a critical element\nof successful monetary policy and, in part, supports the ability of the monetary\nauthorities to implement the first three principles.\n\nClearly these four principles are inter-related and, in many cases, act to reinforce each\nother. But they are distinct nevertheless, and different central banks have approached\ntheir implementation in different ways.\n\nCommitment to Well-Articulated and Achievable Objectives\nThe first principle of sound central banking is to be clear about the goals and objectives\nof policy. Of course, it makes no sense to seek goals that the central bank cannot\nachieve. Another way of saying this is that monetary policymakers must be clear about\nwhat monetary policy can and cannot do. Saying that monetary policy will achieve some\nobjective it is incapable of delivering is a sure way to lose credibility. Let me illustrate\nthis point in the context of the objectives the U.S. Congress has established for the\nFederal Reserve.\nThe Federal Reserve is charged by Congress with conducting monetary policy “so as to\npromote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate\nlong-term interest rates.” These are all desirable goals, yet most economists, myself\nincluded, agree that focusing on achieving one of them — stable prices — is the most\neffective way monetary policy can support the other two.\nMoreover, we have to remember that sustained inflation is always a monetary\nphenomenon and that in a world of paper or fiat money, the central bank has the\nobligation to preserve the purchasing power of the currency so that markets are not\ndistorted by the ravages of inflation.\nMaintaining a stable price level allows the economy to function in a more efficient and\nthus more productive fashion. If people and businesses don’t have to worry that inflation\nwill erode the purchasing power of their money, they won’t have to divert resources from\nproductive activities to conserve their money holdings or to hedge the risks of inflation\n(or deflation). Stable prices also make it easier for households and businesses to make\nlong-term plans and long-term commitments, since they will know what the long-term\nvalue of their money will be. Indeed, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested\nthat an operational definition of price stability is “an environment in which inflation is so\n\n2\n\n\flow and stable over time that it does not materially enter into the decisions of households\nand firms.”\nPrice stability also promotes efficiency in product markets. In a market economy, prices\ngive signals about the relative supplies and demands of goods and services. With a stable\nprice level, changes in prices can easily be recognized as changes in relative prices. With\nprice signals undistorted by inflation, individuals and businesses are able to make better\ndecisions about where to allocate their resources. Thus, price stability helps a market\neconomy allocate resources efficiently and operate at its peak level of productivity.\nPrice stability also works to promote moderate long-term interest rates. First, it reduces\nthe level of compensation built into long-term interest rates to make up for the loss of\npurchasing power due to inflation. Second, it reduces the need for an additional risk\npremium to compensate for the risk that arises from inflation uncertainty.\nIn short, price stability is not only a worthwhile objective in its own right. It is also the\nmost effective way monetary policy can contribute to economic conditions that foster the\nFederal Reserve’s other two objectives: maximum employment and moderate long-term\ninterest rates.\nBut while price stability enhances the economy’s ability to achieve its maximum\npotential growth rate, monetary policy plays no role in determining what that growth rate\nis. In the long run, the economy’s potential growth rate largely reflects two factors. The\nfirst is the growth rate of the labor force, which is determined by demographic factors\nlike the birth rate, age distribution, and immigration. The second is the growth in the\nproductivity of the labor force, which depends on both physical and human capital and\nincentives for research and innovation. Monetary policy cannot be used to achieve a\nlong-run growth rate that is inconsistent with these economic fundamentals.\nCentral bankers all over the world face this situation. Unless a nation has chosen to peg\nits currency to some other country’s currency and rely on that mechanism to control\ndomestic inflation, central bankers bear a unique responsibility for price stability in their\nnations. The corollary to this emphasis on price stability is that monetary policymakers\nshould not commit to what they cannot deliver. It is not possible for a central bank to\nachieve a specific rate of real economic growth or unemployment. And it is not desirable\nto lead the public to believe it is within the central bank’s power to do so.\nUnfortunately, what the public has come to expect of monetary policy, and central\nbanking more generally, has risen considerably over the years. Indeed, there seems to be\na view that monetary policy is the solution to most, if not all, economic ills. Not only is\nthis not true, it is a dangerous misconception and runs the risk of setting up expectations\nthat monetary policy can achieve objectives it cannot attain. To ensure the credibility of\nmonetary policy, we should never ask monetary policy to do more than it can do.\n\n3\n\n\fMaking Commitments Credible\nThe second principle that is important for sound monetary policy is that the central bank\nmust go beyond just stating its objectives — words are not enough. It must also make\nthose commitments to achieve its goals credible and take actions that are consistent with\nthem.\nAs I mentioned at the outset, expectations of the future play a crucial role in all sorts of\ndecisions that people and businesses make today. If the central bank does not deliver on\nits stated objectives, the central bank creates expectational errors and unnecessary\neconomic volatility.\nIf a central bank is to avoid contributing to economic instability, it must not only\narticulate its goals, but it must also make a credible commitment to take actions that will\ndeliver on the objectives it has laid out. How central banks obtain the public’s\nconfidence that they are credibly committed to their monetary policy objectives and to\ntheir plans for achieving those objectives is not an easy task. In democratic societies it is\nnot possible to obtain complete commitment. But there are a variety of ways that\ngovernments and central banks have used to make their commitments more credible with\nthe public.\nPolicymakers, for example, can earn a reputation for delivering on the objectives by\nacting in a consistent way that convinces the public they are committed and credible. To\nmaintain that credibility or reputation, policymakers must continue to act in a way that is\nconsistent with their goals. If they deviate from those goals, then policymakers run the\nrisk of losing credibility.\nIn the U.S., the Federal Reserve has built a reputation for having a commitment to keep\ninflation low and stable. This hard-earned reputation has been an important contributor\nto economic stability for the last 20 years. But that reputation can be lost if we do not\ncontinue to act in a way that is consistent with it. From my perspective, reputational\ncapital is always tenuous — it is hard to acquire but easy to lose and so it must be\nprotected.\nSome governments and central banks have adopted institutional mechanisms to make\ntheir commitments more credible to the public. Many countries have passed legislation\nthat spells out the objectives of the nation’s central bank, and many of those have clearly\nassigned the central bank the task of maintaining a stable price level or a low level of\ninflation. Some governments have spelled out what level of inflation the central bank\nshould target. In other countries, the central bank itself has adopted an inflation target.\nIn either case, the commitment becomes a form of institutional commitment, not just the\nchoice of a specific individual at a point in time. As such, it strengthens the credibility of\nthe commitment.\n\n4\n\n\fOf course, it is not enough to adopt an inflation target. The central bank must also act in\na way that is consistent with that target. Words alone are not enough to make\ncommitments credible.\nAt one time, many countries used the gold standard as a way to commit to the long-run\nstability of the value of their currencies. In more recent times, some countries have\npegged their currencies to another currency, which can limit inflation in their countries.\nSome central banks have experimented with adopting rules — or at least they have\nengaged in rule-like behavior. Some rules involve having the central bank’s policy\ninterest rate respond to changes in either money growth or certain financial or exchange\nrate conditions. Other rules involve adjusting the policy interest rate in response to\ndeviations of inflation from some target as well as to deviations of output (or economic\ngrowth) from its potential. In a recent speech, I argued that research has suggested that\nsimple rules such as those modeled on the Taylor rule appear to perform quite well in a\nwide range of economic models. This implies that using simple rules as a guide to setting\npolicy is a useful way to make monetary policy more systematic and predictable.\nOne important characteristic of simple rules is that they can be more easily explained to\nthe public. That makes it easier for the public and for financial market participants to\nform expectations about policy. Simple rules could enhance the credibility of monetary\npolicy, help anchor expectations, and better align the public’s expectations with the\ncentral bank’s intentions, which would minimize policy surprises and the detrimental\neffects often caused by such surprises.\n\nTransparency and Communications\nThe third principle is transparency. At one level, transparency in monetary policy is\nsimply a part of making credible commitments. Central bankers must clearly articulate to\nthe public their objectives and their plans to achieve those objectives, as well as\nexplaining those occasions when they have reason to deviate from their plans.\nIn my view, one of the benefits of greater transparency is that it can help align the\npublic’s view of what monetary policy is doing with the central bank’s objectives. In this\nway, the public’s expectations about the economy and inflation can be better aligned with\npolicymakers’ objectives and their plans to achieve them. Although the Federal Reserve\nis now much more transparent about its monetary policymaking than it was 20 years ago,\nin my view, this is one area in which central banks in many other countries are ahead of\nthe U.S. Other central banks often provide the public with much more detail about their\npolicy deliberations than we do.\nFor the public and financial markets to understand when and how monetary policy will be\nadjusted, they need a clear picture of the central bank’s outlook. They need to better\nunderstand policymakers’ thinking and what goes into the decision-making process.\nConsequently, I believe that the Federal Reserve’s announcement last November of its\n\n5\n\n\fdecision to provide quarterly releases of information on the economic projections of\nparticipants in the Federal Reserve’s policy committee (the FOMC) is a major step in\nproviding a clearer picture of what goes into our deliberations. With more information\nabout the Federal Reserve’s outlook, individuals and market participants will all be able\nto make their own economic decisions armed with a better understanding of what the\ncentral bank expects to happen in the economy.\nI believe there is another important benefit to transparency. Transparency increases the\ncentral bank’s accountability to the public. In a democratic society it is important that\ninstitutions with the delegated authority to act in the public interest be as clear and as\ntransparent as possible regarding their actions. Failing to do so risks the loss of\nconfidence and credibility — two essential ingredients for sound central bank\npolicymaking.\n\nIndependence of the Central Bank\nThe fourth principle of sound central banking is independence. Research has suggested\nthat countries with more independent central banks have benefited from lower rates of\ninflation, on average, without sacrificing real economic growth.\nCentral bank independence has many dimensions. However, the essence of all the\nmetrics is the stress on the freedom the central bank must have to decide how best to\nachieve its goals. One of the primary reasons that make this essential is that monetary\npolicy works with long lags. So central bankers must take a longer-term view of their\npolicies. Having to take such a longer-run view is undoubtedly one of the reasons that\nmore central banks around the world have been given greater independence from their\nnations’ treasury departments or finance ministries and the political process. Freeing\ncentral bankers from the short-term pressures that inevitably manifest themselves in the\npolitical arena helps monetary policymakers better balance the short-term and long-term\nfactors inherent in their decisions. And this independence underscores the need for\naccountability, and therefore, transparency, my third principle.\n\nCentral Banking and Financial Stability\nMuch of my discussion so far stresses the importance of four principles that I believe\ncontribute to sound monetary policy. However, central banks are also responsible for\npromoting financial stability. It is reasonable to ask if the principles are relevant to this\naspect of central bank policy.\nMost economists believe that an important responsibility of a central bank is to serve as a\nlender of last resort, the ultimate policy tool that supports the stability of the banking\nsystem. The lender of last resort provides the banking system with a source of liquidity\nthat limits the potential for contagion and systemic risk. The current disruption in the\n\n6\n\n\ffinancial markets in many countries around the world has once again focused attention on\nthis well-known, but infrequently exercised, feature of central banking.\nI believe that the four principles of sound monetary policymaking apply in this arena as\nwell. If a central bank is to assume the responsibility of being a lender of last resort, it\nshould clearly articulate its objectives in doing so. It should make credible that\ncommitment and act in a way that is consistent with that commitment. It should clearly\ncommunicate its lending policies to the public. What’s more, the independence of the\ncentral bank’s decision making from short-term political interference is essential to sound\npolicymaking in this arena as well.\n\nSummary\nLet me close by briefly summarizing the four features that I believe are essential to sound\ncentral bank policymaking.\nFirst, central banks should commit to well-articulated and achievable objectives.\nSecond, central banks must seek ways to make their commitments credible. This must\noccur through words and actions.\nThird, central banks must transparently communicate and clearly explain both the central\nbank’s objectives and how it will conduct policy to achieve them.\nFinally, history has shown that a central bank’s independence from the short-term\nvagaries of the political process is an important contributor to sound policymaking.\nI believe that these four principles are important for any central bank and provide a useful\nperspective for thinking about the critical features of sound policymaking. How different\ncentral banks implement these principles in their home countries will vary, and some\napproaches are likely to have more success than others. I, for one, hope we can all learn\nfrom such different experiences in order to find ways to improve, over time, the\neffectiveness of monetary policymaking in all of our countries.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "THE BENEFITS OF SYSTEMATIC MONETARY POLICY\nNational Association for Business Economics\nWashington Economic Policy Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 3, 2008\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nINTRODUCTION\nGood morning. I am delighted to be here today and to help kick off your annual Washington\nPolicy Conference. It is also a pleasure to have the opportunity to be among fellow economists\nwho share my passion for economics and the valuable insights it brings. Indeed, today I want to\ntalk about economics and some of the implications it holds for monetary policy.\nWhen I took this job just over 18 months ago, I told many people that I thought it was an\ninteresting and fascinating time for the Federal Reserve. The challenges and opportunities\nincluded making the transition to a new Chairman in Ben Bernanke after nearly two decades of\ncontinuity and success under Alan Greenspan; implementing the new standards of Basel II; and\ntransforming a financial services business from a massive processor of paper checks to a new\nhighly automated digital business we call Check21. But little did I know just how interesting\nand challenging monetary policy would become.\nLet me start by indicating that my views on monetary policy are shaped by both theory and\npractice. I have been a student of monetary theory and policy for over 30 years. Over this three\ndecade span, it is safe to say that both the theory and practice of monetary policy have changed\ndramatically, for the better I might add. We have advanced our understanding about what\nconstitutes good monetary policy and have incorporated into practice many of the lessons offered\n\n1\n\n\fby theory. Central bankers across the world have also learned and adopted best practices from\neach other.\nBefore I go any further, I should mention that the usual disclaimer applies. While the views I\nexpress here are shared by many students and practitioners of monetary policy outside and inside\ncentral banks, they are my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of\nmy colleagues on the FOMC.\nToday I want to talk about one aspect of good monetary policy. In particular, I want to discuss\nthe importance of systematic monetary policy. For a long time, the received wisdom was that\ncentral banking was supposed to be mysterious and secretive – the less that was said about how\nmonetary policy was conducted the better. Indeed, it wasn’t until 1994 that the Federal Reserve\ndecided to announce the decisions that were made after each FOMC meeting.\nBut times have changed. Transparency has replaced secrecy, and openness and communication\nhave replaced mystery. While there are those who long for the mystique and thrilling days of\nyesteryear and wish for a little more mystery and a little less openness, I don’t think the clock\ncan be turned back – nor should it be.\nThis trend toward more open and transparent monetary policy is widespread. One cannot go to a\nconference on monetary policy anywhere in the world without hearing about the importance of\ntransparency. There are a number of reasons this view has become so widely held. But the most\nprominent development in the last three decades that has led to this perspective is the recognition\nof the important role expectations play in understanding economic behavior. Expectations of the\nfuture play a crucial role in all sorts of decisions that people make today. This is particularly\nevident in financial markets, where investment decisions and the valuations of securities depend\nvery directly on assessments of future economic outcomes. But it is equally true for individuals\nbuying a home or a car, and for businesses considering capital expenditures.\nOf course, this means that, to the extent monetary policy actions today and in the future are\nimportant for economic outcomes, expectations about the future decisions the Federal Reserve\nwill make are also important. Thus, a monetary policy that is more systematic and predictable\ncan reduce expectational errors and contribute to a more stable and efficiently functioning\neconomy. This has led monetary policymakers to stress the importance of credibility and of\n2\n\n\fcommitment to well-articulated and achievable objectives. It has also led to extensive research\non monetary policy rules that can enhance the predictability of policy. 1\n\nSYSTEMATIC POLICY AND SOME EXAMPLES\nEconomic science and the science of monetary policy have come a long way in the last 30 years.\nHowever, they have not progressed to the point where we can specify a formula for setting\nmonetary policy and turn decisions over to a computer. Judgment is still required. Nevertheless,\nwhat theory and practice have taught us is that there is great value in policymaking that is\nsystematic, or what is sometimes called “rule-like” policymaking. This means making policy\ndecisions using available information in a consistent and predictable manner. This does not\nmean one can know what the future holds or what future policy decisions will be. You often\nhear Fed officials speak of policy being data dependent, and indeed it is. But the data should\nfeed into a decision-making process in a mostly systematic way. Some people like to think of\nthis systematic part of policy as a “reaction function” or contingency plan with parameters that\nare largely stable over time.\nOne important characteristic of rule-like behavior is that the rule can be easily articulated to the\npublic. This greatly improves the communication and transparency of monetary policy, which\nleads to fewer expectational errors because everyone has more informed predictions about the\ncourse of monetary policy.\nFriedman’s k-percent Rule\nThe idea that monetary policy should be conducted in a systematic and predictable way is not\nnew. One of the earliest, and most controversial, proposals was Milton Friedman’s famous kpercent money growth rule. 2 Friedman argued monetary policy was a major contributor to\ncyclical fluctuations. He argued that efforts by the central bank to “stabilize” or “fine-tune” the\n\n1\n\n2\n\nSee Plosser (2007) for a discussion of the importance of credibility and commitment.\nSee Friedman (1960).\n\n3\n\n\freal economy were fraught with danger because we didn’t know enough about the short run\ndynamics of monetary actions to reliably predict their effects on the real economy. As a result,\nmonetary policy ended up being a source of real instability rather than a stabilizing influence.\nIn addition, Friedman correctly argued that sustained inflation was always a monetary\nphenomenon and that in a world of paper or fiat money, the central bank had the obligation to\npreserve money’s purchasing power so that markets would not be distorted by inflation. Price\nstability would therefore promote a more efficient allocation of resources. At the time, this view\nof the importance of price stability was controversial, but today it is widely accepted.\nThus, Friedman highlighted two central features of good monetary policy that are hallmarks of\nthe rules that I will turn to shortly. First, he argued that monetary policy should be formulated in\na way that stabilized the purchasing power of money. Second, he stressed monetary policy\nshould not be used to “fine-tune” real economic activity because attempting to do so often\nintroduced instability into the real economy instead of improving economic performance. His\nactual proposal was that the Federal Reserve should announce that the money supply would be\nallowed to grow at k-percent a year -- period. With k a suitably low number, such a policy rule\nwould ensure that inflation would never become a problem and that monetary policy would cease\nto be an independent source of cyclical fluctuations.\nThe Friedman rule is simple and easy to communicate. It also gives a high degree of\npredictability to monetary policy. Had it been implemented, it surely would have prevented the\ndouble-digit inflation the U.S. economy suffered in the late 1970s, as well as much of the\nsubsequent economic disruptions in the early 1980s that occurred as inflation was brought back\ndown to acceptable levels.\nYet the rule has several shortcomings that have limited its appeal. Most important, many\neconomists view money demand as volatile, so that a constant supply of money could lead to\nmore variability in inflation, and perhaps output, than necessary. Thus, most economists believe\nthat some sort of policy that responds to the state of the economy could perform better. 3\n\n3\n\nBennett McCallum (1988) has proposed a version of the Friedman rule that calls for varying the growth rate of the\nmonetary base in response to variations in nominal GDP and a proxy for long-run trends in money demand. The\n\n4\n\n\fTaylor’s Rule\nThe most well-known form of systematic policy was proposed by John Taylor. 4 The Taylor rule\nprescribes how the central bank should set the short-term interest rate, which is the preferred\noperating instrument for most central banks. Thus, central banks can relate to it more easily than\nthe quantity-based rules of Friedman. The rule also allows for feedback from the real economy\nto the setting of the interest rate.\nThe Taylor rule calls for setting the nominal fed funds rate based on three factors. The first\nfactor is an estimate of the economy’s inflation adjusted or real interest rate plus the Fed’s\ntargeted or desired rate of inflation. This you might refer to as the baseline interest rate.\nThe second factor calls for assessing the rate of inflation relative to the central bank’s targeted\ninflation rate. If the inflation rate is above the target, the Taylor rule says that the funds rate\nmust rise. In most specifications the funds rate must rise more than one-for-one with the\ndeviation of inflation relative to target. For example, in Taylor’s original formulation the weight\ngiven on the deviation of inflation from target was 1.5. This means that if inflation was 3 percent\nand the desired inflation rate was 2 percent, then the funds rate must be set 1.5 percentage points\nabove the baseline rate. This “aggressive” reaction to deviations of inflation from target is a\ncharacteristic that Taylor and others have emphasized as being essential to a well-functioning\npolicy.\nThe third element in the Taylor rule calls for adjusting the funds rate based on departures of real\nGDP from some measure of “potential” GDP. The weight given to this factor is usually less than\nthe weight assigned to inflation deviations. Nevertheless, the rule calls for a lower funds rate\nwhen output is below potential.\n\nrule specifies a target for nominal GDP that is the sum of the economy’s long-run trend growth of real GDP and a\ndesired or targeted inflation rate. If nominal GDP growth is above the target, the rule calls for reducing the growth\nrate of the monetary base and vice versa. It also allows for the evolution of money demand to influence base growth\nso that more or less money is supplied as technology and other factors affect the demand for money.\nThe McCallum rule addresses some of the criticisms of the Friedman rule in that it accommodates changes in money\ndemand and allows for feedback from the real economy to monetary policy. However, central banks around the\nworld have largely adopted nominal interest rates as the monetary policy instrument of choice rather than a nominal\nmoney stock measure. Consequently, the McCallum rule has not had much impact in practice.\n4\n\nSee Taylor (1993).\n\n5\n\n\fThe Taylor rule has garnered a great deal of attention and study – substantially more than other\nrules. The reasons are twofold. First, the rule specifies policy actions in terms of movements in\nthe interest rate and thus is called an instrument rule. As I mentioned before, this corresponds\nwith how most central banks implement monetary policy. Second, the rule is dependent on both\ndeviations of inflation from some target and deviations of output from some measure of\npotential. Reacting to these factors seems consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate\nand captures much of the essence of what monetary policymakers see themselves as doing.\nTaylor also attempted to fit actual FOMC decisions to his rule and, much to many observers\nsurprise, the rule described the movements of the fed funds rate remarkably well. Indeed, a\nnumber of researchers have examined the extent to which monetary policy has followed a Taylor\nrule with some success. Interestingly, one of the findings is that from 1987 through about 2003,\na Taylor rule describes fairly well the movements in the fed funds rate, and it is widely agreed\nthat monetary policy was quite effective during this period. As I just noted, one of the\ncharacteristics that Taylor and others emphasize is the importance of aggressive reaction of the\nfunds rate to deviations of inflation from some assumed target. And, indeed, the estimated\nTaylor rules over this period exhibit this property. Of course, the FOMC has not formally\nadopted a target for inflation, but many believe that an implicit one exists. Yet when researchers\ntry to fit a Taylor rule to pre-1987 policy decisions, they find that it doesn’t fit as well. In\nparticular, the response of the funds rate to inflation is not aggressive, which may account for the\nfact that inflation was not contained during the 1970s. 5 Put another way, the Taylor rule suggests\nthat policy should have moved more aggressively against inflation in the 1970s than it in fact\ndid.\n\nGENERAL THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE\nThe attractiveness of Taylor-type rules for monetary policy goes beyond their intuitive appeal or\nthe fact they seem to describe the behavior of monetary policy reasonably well. The reality is\n\n5\n\nThe most notable article in this regard is by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000).\n\n6\n\n\fthat Taylor-like rules yield very good results when judged by the metric of economic welfare in a\nvariety of theoretical settings. While this is surprising to some, it has enormous practical\nimportance. Given our uncertainty about the true model of the economy, knowing that\nsystematic policy in the form of a Taylor-like rule delivers good outcomes across different\nmodels means that it can provide useful guidance for policy.\nAs I mentioned at the outset of my talk, an important and essential element of all macroeconomic\nand monetary theories of the last three decades is the recognition of the role played by\nexpectations – including expectations about the course of monetary policy. More precisely, most\ntheoretical investigations into how monetary policy should work conclude that policy should be\nsystematic and that optimal policy – that is, the policy that delivers the best outcomes for the\neconomy – takes the form of a rule.\nThus it is important to think about monetary policy as being systematic or rule-like. One\nimportant desirable feature of simple interest rate rules such as Taylor’s is – it is a rule. That is,\nit systematically describes the behavior of policy. The advantages of simple rules are many.\nFirst, they are transparent, and allow for simple and effective communication of policy decisions.\nThe result is that policymakers can more easily be held accountable and it is easy for the public\nand financial market participants to form expectations about policy. Thus, relying on simple\nrules enhances the credibility of monetary policy and helps anchor expectations. Second, when\nrules are simple and transparent, the public’s expectations are easily aligned with the Fed’s\nintentions, which minimize policy surprises and the detrimental effects often caused by such\nsurprises. Thus, I place significant importance on systematic behavior both as a prescription for\ngood policy and in terms of my own policy deliberations.\nWe can gain useful insights about what desirable properties a simple systematic policy should\npossess by looking at what types of optimal rules arise in various theoretical environments.\nComputing optimal monetary policy – that is the policy that maximizes economic well-being – is\nusually quite complicated and model specific. Since there is no consensus on the best model of\nthe economy, there can be no consensus on which monetary policy rule is optimal. Optimal\npolicy in one setting may not be optimal policy in some other setting. The optimal policies that\ndo arise in various model settings, however, can serve as useful benchmarks for analyzing the\nperformance of simple rules.\n7\n\n\fAs I alluded to previously, simple rules, in the spirit of Taylor’s original rule, have been found to\nperform remarkably well in that they produce outcomes not too far from those delivered by the\noptimal rule. This result seems to hold in a wide variety of models of the type that are actually\nused to shape our forecasts and our understanding of actual economic events. 6 The implication\nis that using simple rules to benchmark policy is in practice a useful exercise.\nThese well-performing simple rules have three elements that are qualitatively important. First,\nas in the original Taylor rule, the interest rate generally responds aggressively to inflation.\nInterest rate responses to deviations of inflation from target are more than one-for-one. Second,\nthe rules are often, but not always, inertial. By that I mean that today’s interest rate responds to\npast interest rates, which in turn means that policy responses are likely to be somewhat gradual.\nFinally, the rules imply that the interest rate should respond positively to deviations of output\nfrom some measure of “potential.”\nThis last feature arises because any well-designed rule should be responsive to economic\nfundamentals. But by that I do not mean that these rules call for policymakers to try to manage\nthe real economy. In particular, although these rules respond to the state of the economy, they\nare still true to Friedman’s caveat against active management or “fine-tuning.” This is a subtle\nbut important point and differs in principle from the standard stories we are used to hearing about\nmonetary policy. I will return to this critical point in a few moments. Generally, the interest rate\nresponse to output movements is usually quite a bit weaker than the response to inflation, but\nnonetheless important.\nOf course, the best-performing simple rule will vary quantitatively with the economic model\nunder consideration. But what is surprising is that its performance in any particular model is\noften not very sensitive to moderate changes in the weights placed on inflation deviations or\noutput deviations used in the rule. In the jargon of the economics profession, simple rules appear\nto be robust. Thus, the basic lessons of making an aggressive interest rate response to inflation\nand less aggressive movements in response to economic conditions serve as useful guides in\nthinking about systematic policy.\n\n6\n\nSee Levin and Williams (2001).\n\n8\n\n\fAlso, I wish to reemphasize that these rules are not designed to manage the economy, but to\nmanage policy in a way that allows the economy to efficiently use resources given the economic\ndisturbances that it experiences. That is, one should not think of the Fed as moving interest rates\nto manage or stabilize real economic outcomes, but rather think of the Fed as placing the interest\nrate at the level that allows for the best economic outcome given the environment. The fact that\nthe central bank’s interest rate should be somewhat lower when the economy is weak than when\nit is strong, should not be confused with a desire for active management of the real economy.\nThis is an important distinction and one that I think is misunderstood, so let me try to clarify it\nwith a familiar example.\n\nTHE REAL BUSINESS CYCLE MODEL\nA more concrete way to emphasize this point, one that I view as critical for thinking about\nmonetary policy, is to examine economic behavior in what is called a real business cycle model. 7\nMany of you are familiar with this model, and while it does not provide a fully accurate\nrepresentation of the true economy – and we don’t have a model that does — it possesses\nfeatures that are embedded in many major macroeconomic models of the U.S. economy,\nincluding FRBUS, the Board’s econometric model, and the forecasting models of many of the\nReserve Banks. These econometric models have a real business cycle framework at their core,\nbecause that paradigm has a lot of desirable features and helps explain, at least qualitatively, a\ngood portion of economic behavior.\nIn the real business cycle model the real interest rate moves in response to various shocks. For\nexample, take a persistent positive productivity shock that allows the economy to produce more\nwith the same amount of resources. What happens is fairly intuitive and qualitatively much in\nline with how most of us think the actual economy behaves.\nIn response to this shock, all factors of production, capital and labor, are more productive. As a\nresult, firms desire to invest more, which increases the capital stock. They are also willing to pay\n\n7\n\nSee Plosser (1989) for an introduction to this literature.\n\n9\n\n\fhigher wages to their now more productive workers, and this encourages more labor supply and\nhigher employment.\nConsumers, who see both asset prices rising and their wages increasing, are wealthier and want\nto consume more. Because it takes time for additional productive capacity to come on line,\ninitially demand exceeds supply at the old interest rate. As a result, the equilibrium real interest\nrate, which will equate supply and demand, is now higher, in line with the higher marginal\nproduct of capital.\nIf a policymaker were setting the interest rate, he should set it exactly at this competitive\noutcome, not because he is trying to smooth economic activity, but because this higher interest\nrate allows for the most efficient allocation of resources and allows the economy to accumulate\nresources, including capital, at an optimal rate -- and thus, to grow optimally.\nIn the more complex world we live in, this example serves as an important lesson for monetary\npolicymakers. They must try to set the interest rate at a level that is efficient. No easy task, but\nmuch different than trying to smooth economic activity in response to shocks.\n\nSIMPLE RULES IN PRACTICE\nThere are, of course, limitations to the use of simple rules. First, by their nature they are not\ndesigned to work well in all circumstances. They basically work well on average. Thus, they\nprovide useful benchmarks in assessing the stance of policy. However, there will inevitably be\nspecial circumstances or shocks that fall outside the scope of our economic models that will\nwarrant monetary policy action. Events such as 9/11, the Asian financial crisis, or perhaps the\nstock market crash of 1987 may justify some departure of policy from simple rule-like behavior.\nBut these events are mostly obvious and it is easy to explain the departures without planting\ndoubts about the ultimate direction or goals of policy. However, even in these instances the rules\nserve to quantify the degree of departure and act as guidelines in informing us how excessively\ntight or easy policy might be. It is also the case that such events are temporary in nature and thus\nat some point special monetary actions would be reversed or eliminated. Otherwise,\npolicymakers run the risk of undermining the more fundamental goals of policy. Indeed,\n10\n\n\fpersistent departures from simple rule-like behavior have generally resulted in bad economic\noutcomes.\nAnother challenge facing the implementation of simple policy rules is that the underlying\nmeasures they rely on are for the most part unobservable. The underlying real rate of interest\nthat is consistent with the equilibrium growth path of the economy is not directly observable.\nNeither is the appropriate measure of the output gap.\nFurthermore, it is important to recognize that there are various strategies for quantifying Taylorlike rules. That is, there are variations on a theme that try to address various measurement and\ntheoretical issues. For example, rather than focusing on the level of output gaps, some versions\nof the rule use the difference in the growth rate of real GDP and some measure of the growth rate\nof “potential” or trend GDP. This avoids the notoriously difficult problems of estimating the\nlevel of “potential” GDP.\nAnother variation on the rule is to consider more forward-looking elements that focus on\nforecasts of inflation and output as opposed to current or recent past values of these variables.\nBut the distinction is more apparent than real since forecasts depend on current values in crucial\nways.\nFinally, the science of monetary policy is not stagnant. Thus it is important that the best policy\nrules may evolve as our understanding of the economy evolves. But we should not be afraid of\nsuch evolution nor view it as a reason not to commit to behaving in a systematic manner. Instead\nit should heighten our efforts to communicate and ensure the transparency of our actions.\nThus, any effort to use the implications of such rules entails some degree of uncertainty and\nchoice of the appropriate specification. But that is not reason to ignore or abandon the concept\nand use of such systematic policy rules as guides. Monetary policymakers face lots of\nuncertainties and unknowns regardless of how decisions are reached. Uncertainties are not an\nexcuse for pure discretion. One advantage of simple and robust rules is that they can help focus\nattention on the types of measurements and data that are important for policy and encourage\nresearch to improve our estimates. We also have to remember that an important reason for\nrelying on systematic policy is to anchor expectations about the future, thereby reducing the\n\n11\n\n\finefficiencies and distortions that arise from expectational errors. Thus, in practice, one might\nlook at several versions of the rule’s specification to assess the stance of policy.\n\nSUMMARY\nLet me just summarize the basic desirable features that systematic policy in the form of simple\nrules provide. They are desirable because they are systematic and imply policy responses that\nare forecastable by the public. Further, by being systematic they anchor inflation expectations.\nWhen those become unanchored, the effects of policy become more uncertain. The economic\nepisodes where the public became uncertain of the Federal Reserve’s intentions regarding\ninflation have been especially costly. So an important part of the appeal of simple rules is that\nthey aid in maintaining credibility for low inflation. Finally, simple rules make monetary policy\neasy to monitor and to gauge when policy is departing from business as usual. More\nimportantly, simple rules help gauge the extent of that departure and helps policymakers explain\nthe reasons for the departure – further improving monetary policy communications and\ntransparency. Thus, making policy decisions using simple rules as benchmarks based on\npublicly observable information serves to assure the public that the Fed is behaving in a manner\nconsistent with its long-run objectives. It also helps avoid having the public’s expectations\nbecome disconnected from monetary policy’s long-run objectives.\n\nTHE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT – SOME EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES\nThe current economic environment does have some extraordinary features, namely the\ntremendous difficulties that are affecting the smooth working of capital markets. Some interest\nrate spreads remain high, and financial capital has taken serious hits at a number of institutions.\nThus, I believe we are in a situation where monetary policy cannot be made by focusing solely\non inflation and deviations of output from potential. The current turmoil in financial markets has\nalready had a significant impact on the economy and has the potential to continue to restrain\neconomic growth going forward.\n\n12\n\n\fTo be more concrete, many versions of the simple rules that I refer to when gauging the current\nstance of monetary policy call for a funds rate that is above the current funds rate. But the\nseverity of the events affecting the smooth functioning of financial markets suggests that rates,\nperhaps, should be somewhat lower than simple rules might suggest. However, determining the\nappropriate extent of such extra accommodation is difficult to quantify, but should also be\ndisciplined by systematic policy.\nConsequently, there are, and should be, limits to such departures from the guidance given by\nsimple rules. One cannot, and should not, ignore other fundamental aspects of policy, especially\nthe tendency for inflation to accelerate when policy is unduly easy. Moreover, departures from\nthe more systematic elements of making policy decisions must be relatively transitory and\nreversed in due course if we are to keep expectations of future inflation well-anchored.\nOtherwise we risk eroding the public’s confidence in monetary policy’s commitment to deliver\nprice stability, and we know from the 1970s and early 1980s that the cost of regaining the\npublic’s confidence can be quite high.\nThe benefits of operating in an environment with the transparency afforded by simple rules is\nthat it gives monetary policymakers the ability to anchor expectations and affords them the\nopportunity to temporarily deviate from the simple rules in extraordinary circumstances without\neroding central bank credibility. We are now, perhaps, in a period of extraordinary\ncircumstances and have deviated from the benchmarks suggested by simple rules. But such\ndeviations should be temporary and limited and promptly reversed when conditions return to\nnormal.\nMonetary policymakers should continue to pursue their efforts to develop and put into practice\nmore rule-like behavior. It is one of the more important paths to sound monetary policy over the\nlong-run.\n\n13\n\n\fREFERENCES\nClarida, Richard, Jordi Gali, and Mark Gertler. “Monetary Policy Rules and Macroeconomic\nStability: Evidence and Some Theory,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, MIT Press, vol. 115(1)\n(February 2000), pp. 147-80.\nFriedman, Milton.

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nIt is indeed a pleasure to be back in Birmingham, my hometown. Not only have I had the\nopportunity to visit with family and friends, but this trip has also given me the\nopportunity to enjoy some warmer temperatures than I have been experiencing in\nPhiladelphia. From Philip Jackson’s introduction, you will note that my latest career\nmove has been in a southerly direction — moving away from the deep snows of\nRochester, New York, and into the more moderate coastal climate of Philadelphia. If that\ndoesn’t sound like much progress climate-wise, you don’t know Rochester.\nOf course, friends and colleagues, not to mention family members, have questioned my\njudgment regarding what represents a desirable climate since I moved to Chicago as a\ngraduate student nearly 40 years ago. And they developed even more serious doubts\nwhen my wife and I moved from Palo Alto, California, to Rochester. But regardless of\nwhere life and opportunities have taken me, Birmingham will always be my hometown\nand I am delighted to be back.\nI especially want to thank Philip Jackson for giving me the opportunity to be here with\nyou today. Those of you who know Philip understand he is no stranger to the Federal\nReserve, having served on the Board of Governors from 1975-78 under Chairman Arthur\nBurns. And he is certainly no stranger to some of what I’ll be discussing with you today.\nThank you, Philip, for the invitation to return to Birmingham and for the opportunity to\nspeak to the Rotary Club.\nBirmingham and the surrounding region have changed quite a bit since I left to go to\ncollege over four decades ago. The UAB Medical Center was only a vision of what\nmight be. The industrial base was weak and in decline, and many of us were envious of\nthe more rapidly growing metro areas in other parts of the country. Since then\nBirmingham has undergone a resurgence. Its economic base has broadened and\ndiversified. As a result, it has grown and prospered. I have little doubt there are many\npeople throughout the country who now envy the quality of life Birmingham has to offer.\nMy own sojourns over the last four decades have taken me from Birmingham, to\nChicago, to New York City, Palo Alto, Rochester, and now Philadelphia. Most of my\n\n\fcareer has been spent as an academic economist, doing research and teaching in the areas\nof macroeconomics, monetary theory, and finance.\nAfter studying and conducting research on the macroeconomy and monetary policy for\nabout 30 years, I am indeed fortunate to have the privilege of serving as the president and\nCEO of one of the 12 Reserve Banks in the Federal Reserve System. It is a great\nexperience. The Philadelphia Reserve Bank has about 1100 employees, and like our\nsister Bank in Atlanta, it has three major responsibilities. One of those is the supervision\nand regulation of banks and bank holding companies. Another is helping to ensure the\nsmooth operation of the nation’s payment systems — basically by providing financial\nservices to banks and the U.S. Treasury.\nThe Reserve Banks’ third major responsibility is monetary policy. This responsibility\nhas two dimensions. First, each Reserve Bank’s board of directors regularly makes\nrecommendations about its discount rate — that is, the interest rate at which the Reserve\nBank lends to banks and other depository institutions. Such recommendations are\nultimately approved or denied by the System’s Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.,\nbut each Reserve Bank has an opportunity to provide its region’s input on those decisions\nas part of the process.\nThe second way in which a Reserve Bank contributes to monetary policy is through its\npresident’s role as a member of the System’s Federal Open Market Committee — or\nFOMC, as it is usually called. It is the body within the Fed that makes monetary policy\nfor the nation. Congress established the Federal Reserve as a decentralized central bank.\nGiving each Reserve Bank a seat at the FOMC table is another way for the Reserve Bank\nto convey its region’s perspective on both local and national economic and financial\ndevelopments. The Bank presidents also bring an important diversity of views to the\ntable. The Committee’s ability to make thoughtful and sound policy choices is greatly\nstrengthened by the interaction of members with different perspectives. I am fond of\nrecounting the words of that famous writer and journalist Walter Lippman, who once\nsaid, “Where all men think alike, no one thinks very much.” I believe the give and take at\nFOMC meetings reflects the fact that a lot of thinking goes into the decisions the\nCommittee makes. If we all agreed all the time, there would be little reason for the\nCommittee to meet.\nFor someone who has been a student of monetary policy for many years, serving on the\nFOMC is simply a great opportunity. Sometimes I am asked if my views regarding\npolicy have changed now that I am an insider, so to speak, rather than the outsider\nlooking in. The answer is that sound economic analysis is independent of where you sit,\nso that my fundamental views have not changed. That does not mean that applying or\nimplementing sound policy is necessarily easy. Indeed, when I took the position in\nAugust 2006, little did I know how challenging the FOMC’s job would be during 2007\nand 2008.\n\n\fThe FOMC and Monetary Policy Objectives\nIn conducting monetary policy, the FOMC seeks to foster financial conditions, including\ngrowth of money and credit and a level of short-term interest rates, consistent with\nachieving two goals: price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth. I\nbelieve that the most important contribution the Fed can make to sustained economic\ngrowth and employment rests on credibly committing to and achieving long-run price\nstability. In fact, without a credible commitment to maintaining price stability, the Fed’s\nability to promote sustainable growth would be seriously undermined. Moreover, price\nstability is not only an important element in achieving sustained economic growth, it is\nalso critical in promoting financial stability.\nThe primary tool for implementing monetary policy is the federal funds rate, which is the\ninterest rate at which banks trade overnight funds. The FOMC controls the funds rate by\nbuying and selling government securities in what is known as open market operations.\nThe FOMC meets approximately every six weeks, but, of course, can meet more often as\nnecessitated by economic developments, as we did in January. The Committee’s\nobjective at each meeting is to set an appropriate target level for the fed funds rate that\nsupports its longer-term goals.\nIt is important to recognize that the influence of changes in the FOMC’s targeted funds\nrate on inflation and economic growth occurs with a lag, so by necessity the FOMC must\nbe forward-looking in setting an appropriate funds rate target. It must forecast future\neconomic growth and inflation based on available economic data and financial\nconditions, including a particular path for the fed funds rate.\nBut paraphrasing physicist Nils Bohr, forecasting is a tricky exercise — especially if it’s\nabout the future. Thus we must recognize that circumstances change and sometimes they\ncan change very quickly. As new economic data become available, the Committee must\nconsider the data carefully and assess how they impact our forecast of future economic\noutcomes. When the outlook for output and inflation does change appreciably, the\nCommittee may choose to adjust its fed funds rate target to achieve its longer-term goals.\nSince last August, economic data have been particularly volatile, making the assessment\nof the outlook unusually difficult and subject to revision. A change in the economic\noutlook is what was at work in the last two weeks when the FOMC decided to reduce its\ntarget fed funds rate in two steps to its current level of 3 percent.\nLet me elaborate on recent economic and financial conditions and my current outlook for\nthe economy and inflation.\n\nThe Outlook\nSince last August, financial and economic conditions have deteriorated. As that\noccurred, policymakers revised downward their forecasts for 2008 economic growth.\n\n\fThis took place in several steps as new data were released and, in turn, led the FOMC to\nlower the federal funds rate in a series of steps.\nBy last September, we had already seen a cumulative deterioration in the housing sector\nduring the earlier part of 2007. In addition, the disruptions in financial markets in August\ncaused by the problems in the subprime mortgage market raised the risk of potential\nadverse effects on the broader economy from a further tightening of credit conditions. As\na result, I lowered my projection of economic growth for the fourth quarter of 2007 and\nthe first half of 2008. In particular, the adjustment to my forecast involved pushing back\nthe turnaround in residential construction, as low demand for homes meant it would take\nlonger than expected for the economy to work off the inventories of new and existing\nhomes for sale. The continuing high prices of oil and other commodities also suggested\nthe potential for some slowing in the pace of economic activity, as well as hinting at\nincreasing inflationary pressures — a point I will return to later. As the outlook changed,\nthe FOMC lowered the fed funds rate target by 50 basis points in September, and then by\nanother 25 basis points in both October and early December.\nSince the Committee’s meeting in early December, the economic data have indicated that\nthe deterioration in the housing market has continued unabated. Although that by itself\nwas discouraging, other economic indicators also showed signs of an economy that was\nweakening. The renewed widening of some credit spreads in financial markets, along\nwith weaker figures for retail sales, manufacturing activity, and job growth in December,\nled many forecasters in early January to further mark down their forecasts for 2008. The\nsharp rise in December’s unemployment rate, which was released in early January, also\nheightened many economists’ concerns about the economy’s health. What’s more, the\nPhiladelphia Reserve Bank’s closely watched manufacturing survey recorded a\nsurprisingly steep decline in industrial activity in January, to a level not seen since the\nlast recession.\nAlthough the economy’s resilience to past shocks makes me cautious about making\nchanges to my outlook based on just one or two pieces of economic news, the string of\nweaker than anticipated numbers released in late December and in January had a\ncumulative effect on my own assessment of the 2008 outlook. While I would not be very\nsurprised if the economy bounces back more quickly than many forecasters are now\nprojecting, I am now, nevertheless, anticipating a weaker first half of 2008 than I did in\nOctober. This downward revision to the economic outlook is what led me to conclude\nthat a substantially lower level of interest rates was needed to support the process of\nreturning the economy to its trend rate of growth. Consequently, I believe the recent\nreductions in the federal funds rate were a necessary and appropriate recognition of this\nchanged outlook.\nThe ongoing housing correction and the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets\nare significant near-term drags on the economy and I expect growth in the first half of the\nyear to be quite weak, around 1 percent. As conditions in the housing and financial\nmarkets begin to stabilize, I expect growth to improve in the second half of the year and\n\n\fto move back to trend, which I estimate is around 2.7 percent, in 2009. Overall, I am\nnow anticipating economic growth in 2008 of near 2 percent.\nGiven the slowdown in economic growth this year, payroll employment will rise more\nslowly than last year and will remain below trend for much of the year before picking up\nin 2009. Slower job growth will also lead to an unemployment rate near 5-1/4 percent in\n2008, after fluctuating between 4-1/2 and 5 percent in 2007.\nTwo adjustments will continue to be needed to help work down the large number of\nunsold homes: further cuts in construction and declines in housing prices. I expect the\ndecline in housing starts will bottom out in the middle of this year, but starts are likely to\nthen be quite flat through the end of 2009 as the inventory of unsold homes is reduced\ngradually.\nOf course, as was the case in 2007, how quickly housing bottoms out remains one of the\nmain uncertainties surrounding any forecast in today’s environment. It seems that ever\nsince last spring, the turnaround in housing was always six months away. Well, nine\nmonths later, it is still six months away. Simply having housing stop contracting will\nhelp economic growth. In 2007 the decline in residential construction took 1 percentage\npoint off real GDP growth, which turned out to be 2.5 percent for the year (4th quarter to\n4th quarter). Once residential construction stops declining, it will cease subtracting from\noverall growth. But housing is unlikely to make a positive contribution to economic\ngrowth until 2009.\nBusiness investment should continue to increase this year, but at a slower pace than in\n2007. Outside of autos and housing, there isn’t a large inventory overhang in the\neconomy to be worked off. This is actually good news. Recessions are often preceded\nby periods of large inventory accumulation and much of the decline in production during\nrecessions reflects a working off of an inventory imbalance. The absence of such an\ninventory overhang is encouraging.\nThe biggest component of GDP is consumer spending. With slower growth of\nemployment and personal income in the first half of 2008, and as the decline in the value\nof homes and equities diminishes households’ net worth, consumer spending is likely to\ngrow more slowly before picking up again in 2009.\nOne piece of good news has been the growth in exports. The trade sector supported\neconomic growth last year as domestic demand weakened in the U.S. while foreign\ngrowth remained strong. The declining dollar also helped fuel a rebound in our exports.\nThe net export component of GDP should continue to improve this year, although more\nslowly than it did in 2007 because we are likely to see somewhat slower growth among\nour major trading partners this year.\n\nInflation\n\n\fLet me now turn to the outlook for inflation. Unfortunately, I expect little progress to be\nmade in reducing core inflation this year or next, and I am skeptical that slower economic\ngrowth will help. All you have to do is recall the 1970s when we experienced both high\nunemployment and high inflation to appreciate that slow economic growth and lower\ninflation do not necessarily go hand in hand. I anticipate that core inflation (which\nexcludes the prices of food and energy) is likely to remain in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range\nin 2008, which is above the range I consider to be consistent with price stability. If oil\nprices stabilize near their current levels, I expect headline, or total, inflation to decrease\nto around the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range in 2008.\nWhile the Fed’s goal is to achieve stable prices for all goods and services, economists and\npolicymakers sometimes focus on core inflation, as it has been thought to give a better\nindication of underlying inflation pressures since it excludes food and energy prices,\nwhich can be quite volatile. The idea is that over time, core and headline inflation rates\nshould, on average, be similar, as increases in the volatile components are offset by later\ndecreases and vice versa. I am concerned, however, that over the past 10 years headline\ninflation has exceeded core inflation by about 40 to 50 basis points. This has been true of\nboth the consumer price index (CPI) and the broader personal consumption expenditure\n(PCE) price index. Indeed, headline inflation rates have exceeded core inflation rates in 8\nof the last 10 years for both the CPI and the PCE price measures on an annual average\nbasis. While I would like to believe that, over time, these two rates should be converging\non average, I am concerned that the data are suggesting that core inflation rates may not\nbe as indicative of underlying or trend inflation as we might have thought. My\nconclusion is that we need to look at both measures of inflation — headline and core —\nsince it is not clear which one is telling us the most about underlying inflationary\npressures. As a consequence, I was very much in favor of the FOMC’s beginning to\ninclude forecasts of both core and headline inflation in our quarterly forecasts.\nAs the FOMC’s January 30 statement said, it will be necessary to continue to monitor\ninflation developments carefully. Most measures of inflation, including the core CPI and\ncore PCE price measures, accelerated in the second half of 2007 compared to the first\nhalf. With inflation creeping up, we have to be particularly alert for rising inflation\nexpectations. It is important that inflation expectations remain stable. If those\nexpectations become unhinged, they could rapidly fuel inflation. Moreover, as we\nlearned from the experience of the 1970s, once the public loses confidence in the Fed’s\ncommitment to price stability, it is very costly to the economy for the Fed to regain that\nconfidence. The painful period of the early 1980s was the price the economy paid to\nrestore the credibility of the Fed’s commitment — we certainly do not wish to go through\nthat process again.\nFortunately, so far inflation expectations have not changed very much. But they bear\nwatching because there are some signs that they, too, are edging higher. These may be\nearly warning signs of a weakening of our credibility, and we must be very careful to\navoid that.\n\n\fMonetary Policy Going Forward\nHow do I think about monetary policy going forward? Recall that monetary policy works\nwith a lag. The full impact of changes in monetary policy on output and employment\nmay not materialize for several quarters at the earliest. Thus, actions taken today depend\nin a critical way on how one sees the economy evolving over the next year or two. Put\nanother way, actions taken today will have little appreciable impact on the real economy\nover the next couple of quarters.\nAs I have already emphasized, this lagged response means that monetary policy decisions\ndepend critically on the outlook for the economy over the intermediate term.\nForecasting, however, is a difficult task. Data are noisy and are often revised, which\nmeans it is difficult, in real time, to extract clear signals about the economy from these\nnoisy data. In times of economic turbulence and uncertainty, the problem of extracting a\nsignal becomes especially acute. That does not mean that you can stop forecasting, but it\ndoes mean that the uncertainty surrounding any forecast will be unusually large and may\nbe very sensitive to incoming data.\nOver the course of the last five months, as forecasts for economic growth have been\nrevised downward, the FOMC has lowered the fed funds rate by 225 basis points — from\n5.25 percent to 3 percent. Taking expected inflation into account, the level of the federal\nfunds rate in real terms — what economists call the real rate of interest — is now\napproaching zero. That is clearly an accommodative level of real interest rates. The last\ntime the level of real interest rates was this low was in 2003-2004. But that was a\ndifferent time with a different concern — deflation — and we were intentionally seeking\nto prevent prices from falling. Recently we have had reason to be worried about rising\ninflation, not declining prices.\nThe FOMC’s reductions in the federal funds rate have been proactive in responding to\nevolving economic conditions that led to the deterioration in the outlook for economic\ngrowth. My inclination to alter monetary policy depends on whether the accumulation of\nevidence based on the data between now and our next meeting causes me to revise my\nforecast further. Weaker than expected data might lead to a downward revision, while\nstronger than expected data may lead to an upward revision to the forecast.\nTo make this point concrete, last Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the\neconomy lost 17,000 jobs in January. This was not an encouraging number. However, it\nwas consistent with my forecast of weak employment growth in the first quarter of this\nyear. Thus, by itself, it does not lead to a substantive revision to my forecast. We must\nlook at the accumulation of data from a variety of sources to assess how the outlook may\nhave changed relative to what was expected.\nI also want to note that in early January there was much concern when the BLS reported\nonly 18,000 jobs were created in December. Yet in the employment report last Friday\nthat preliminary number was revised up to 82,000. Thus, we have to realize that\n\n\feconomic data are subject to revision, and we have to be very careful not to rely on any\none statistic or data series in assessing current economic conditions or our outlook.\nThere are those who have expressed the view that in times of economic weakness, the\nFed must not worry about inflation and should focus its entire effort on restoring\neconomic growth by dramatically driving interest rates down as far and as rapidly as\npossible. To borrow a line attributed to that famous, or perhaps infamous, Union\nAdmiral David Farragut at the Battle of Mobile Bay, it is sort of a “damn the torpedoes,\nfull speed ahead” approach to policy. But the Fed has a dual mandate for a reason. Price\nstability is a necessary component for achieving sustained economic growth. Ignoring\nprice stability during times of economic weakness risks undermining our ability to\nachieve economic growth over the long run. It fuels higher inflation down the road and\nrisks inappropriate risk taking and recurring boom/bust cycles. This would be\ncounterproductive.\nAlthough it might be tempting to think that monetary policy is the solution to most, if not\nall, economic ills, this is not the case. I think it is particularly important, for example, to\nrecognize that monetary policy cannot solve all the problems the economy and financial\nsystem now face. It cannot solve the bad debt problems in the mortgage market. It\ncannot re-price the risks of securities backed by subprime loans. It cannot solve the\nproblems faced by those financial firms at risk of being given lower ratings by rating\nagencies because some of their assets are now worth much less than previously thought.\nThe markets will have to solve these problems, as indeed they will. But it will take some\ntime. However, the Fed can and should help by offsetting some of the restraint created\nby tightening credit conditions and the sharp reduction in housing investment. The Fed\ncan and should also promote the orderly functioning of financial markets.\nGoing forward, then, my approach to making monetary policy decisions will be to look at\nincoming information and ask whether it is consistent with my outlook and the\nachievement of the Fed’s dual mandate. My outlook for 2008 already incorporates the\nfact that we will be receiving quite a few weak economic numbers in the first half of the\nyear. However, to the extent that economic conditions evolve differently than expected,\nwe will need to be prepared to incorporate those changing conditions into our policy\ndecisions in a manner that is consistent with our dual mandate.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, my own forecast for economic activity has been revised downward since\nlast October as economic conditions have evolved. I believe the recent reductions in the\nlevel of the federal funds rate target will be supportive of the economic adjustment\nprocess and a return to trend growth near the end of this year and on into 2009. The Fed\nhas been aggressive in making this adjustment in rates, which will mitigate some, but not\nall, of the problems the economy and financial markets are facing. Some problems will\nsimply take time for the financial markets to work out.\n\n\fIn taking aggressive action in supporting the economy’s eventual return to its trend\ngrowth rate, I continue to believe we must not lose sight of the other part of the Fed’s\ndual mandate – which is price stability. We cannot be confident that a slow-growing\neconomy in early 2008 will by itself reduce inflation. I am also convinced that we need\nto keep our eye on both headline as well as core inflation in assessing how well we are\ndoing in achieving our goal of price stability.\nGoing forward, monetary policy decisions will depend on how the economy unfolds and\nwhether further changes in the economic outlook are necessary.\nAgain, let me thank Philip Jackson and the Rotary Club for inviting me to return to speak\nhere in Birmingham.\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nGood morning and thank you for inviting me to help kick off the new year. This is the\ntime of year for both reflection and prognostication. When it comes to the economy, both\nare important and useful exercises. Yet both are challenging tasks. On the one hand,\nlooking back is often helpful in understanding what happened. On the other hand, it\ndoesn’t always tell us why it happened. Indeed, economists are often very adept at\noffering multiple explanations for why the economy behaved as it did. Thus, while\nhindsight may be 20-20 in terms of the facts, it is often much fuzzier when it comes to\ndrawing lessons for the future. Sometimes clarity materializes only many years later and\nmay be very different from the interpretations offered in the midst, or the immediate\naftermath, of some particular economic episode.\nForecasting the future is, of course, even more difficult, and a healthy dose of humility is\nappropriate. Nonetheless, forecasting is a necessary task if you are in business. How the\neconomy or the market for your product is likely to evolve over the coming year is\ncritical to actions you take today. It is no less true for policymakers, as I will argue\nshortly.\nThis morning I want to talk about the state of the economy, share with you my views\nabout the economic outlook, and comment on the uncertainties that surround that outlook.\nI will also discuss some of the key challenges facing the central bank, particularly as they\nrelate to the strains in financial markets.\nEconomic and Financial Conditions\nLet me set the stage for 2008 by first looking back at 2007. A year ago, we were in the\nmidst of a sluggish first quarter of 2007, with real GDP growth of only 0.6 percent. That\nweak pace of growth was in large part the result of a decline in housing activity, although\nbusiness investment was also very sluggish. Thus there was growing concern about what\nsuch weak first-quarter growth would mean for the remainder of 2007 and even some talk\nabout the prospects for a recession.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBut the U.S. economy has, over the years, exhibited remarkable resiliency—and it did so\nonce again. Current estimates indicate that growth of real GDP picked up to nearly 4\npercent in the second quarter of 2007, and then to nearly 5 percent in the third quarter.\nConsumer spending generally held up in the second and third quarters despite the rise in\nenergy prices and despite the declines in house prices in a number of regions. The\nchanges in house prices did limit the accumulation of housing-related wealth and may\nhave curtailed some consumer spending, although the magnitude of that curtailment has\nbeen much less than many predicted. While there were ongoing sharp declines in\nresidential construction activity in both the second and third quarters, nonresidential\nconstruction remained quite strong and business investment in equipment and software\nheld up quite well. The other positive development over the course of the year was the\nstrong growth of exports.\nIn labor markets, the average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter was 4.8 percent,\nalthough it ended on a somewhat sour note by rising to 5.0 percent in December.\nInflation seemed to moderate somewhat in the first part of the year, but the rise in prices\nfor oil and other commodities in the second half of the year indicates that inflationary\npressures are still with us.\nWe will not receive the first report on fourth quarter GDP until late in January. If it turns\nout that growth was as weak as 1 percent or so, as many forecasters expect, the economy\nstill will have grown at an overall 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent rate in 2007. That seems a\nrespectable showing considering the prolonged weakness in residential construction, the\nhigh price of oil, and the problems that developed in financial markets.\nIndeed, the strains in financial markets are an important and distinguishing feature of the\neconomic landscape that emerged in 2007 and have become a key issue facing the\nFederal Reserve. Episodes of financial turmoil are not uncommon – recall the stock\nmarket crash of 1987, the turmoil surrounding the collapse of Long-Term Capital\nManagement in 1998, or the attacks of September 11, 2001 that led to severe disruptions\nin the infrastructure of our financial system. While such episodes are thankfully quite\ninfrequent, they highlight the role played by the central bank in promoting the orderly\nfunctioning of our financial markets.\nMonetary Policy and Financial Stability\nLet me elaborate. The goals of monetary policy are to promote price stability and\nmaximum sustainable economic growth. I believe that the most important contribution\nthe Fed can make to sustained economic growth and employment rests on credibly\ncommitting to and achieving long-run price stability. Moreover, price stability is not\nonly an important element in achieving sustained economic growth, it is also critical in\npromoting financial stability.\nYet, as in the episodes I just noted, as well as the recent turmoil surrounding the repricing of risk in the subprime mortgage market, there are times when financial markets\n\n2\n\n\f3\nbecome strained or impaired in ways that can be detrimental to the economy as a whole.\nIn such episodes it is widely expected that the central bank should take steps to promote\nthe orderly functioning of financial markets. For this, the primary tool the Fed has at its\ndisposal is to be the lender of last resort. Typically such lending occurs through the\nBank’s discount window, which provides collateralized loans to any depository\ninstitution.\nBefore I talk about the distinctive role of the central bank in addressing financial distress,\nlet me spend a few minutes summarizing monetary policy so that its relationship with the\nFed’s role in financial stability will be clearer.\nIn conducting monetary policy, the Federal Reserve seeks to foster financial conditions,\nincluding growth of money and credit and a level of short-term interest rates, consistent\nwith achieving price stability and thus promoting sustainable economic growth. The\nprimary tool for implementing monetary policy is the federal funds rate, which is the\ninterest rate at which banks trade overnight funds. The Fed’s policymaking arm—the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or FOMC—controls the funds rate by buying and\nselling government securities in what is known as open market operations. The FOMC\nmeets approximately every six weeks to decide an appropriate target level for the fed\nfunds rate. The Committee’s objective at each meeting is to set the target funds rate at a\nlevel that supports its longer-term goals.\nThe influence of changes in the FOMC’s targeted funds rate on inflation and economic\ngrowth occurs with a lag, so by necessity the FOMC must be forward-looking in setting\nan appropriate funds rate target. It must forecast future economic growth and inflation\nbased on available data on the economy and financial conditions, including a particular\ntarget path for the fed funds rate. As new economic data become available, the\nCommittee may find it needs to modify its forecast of future economic outcomes because\nof changes in various factors affecting the outlook. When the outlook for output and\ninflation does change appreciably, the Committee may choose to adjust its fed funds rate\ntarget to achieve its longer-term goals. Thus, the setting of appropriate monetary policy is\na dynamic process.\nAs I mentioned at the outset, forecasting the economy is a difficult task. But\npolicymakers, like business leaders, really have very little alternative. Changes we make\nto the funds rate today will not have any appreciable effect on prices, employment, or\noutput for at least several quarters. That means any decision we make today will depend,\nin part, on our forecast of the economy for the latter half of 2008 and for 2009, since that\nis when its effects will most likely be felt. While the forecasting task is a difficult one,\nwe are fortunate to have an extraordinary team of economists in Washington and in the\nFederal Reserve Banks that help us develop our projections and assess the economic\nlandscape.\nAs you are no doubt aware, the monthly statistics reported on the economy can be\nvolatile and subject to revision. Recall that in early September we thought the economy\nhad lost 4,000 jobs in August, only to learn in October that it actually had gained 93,000\n\n3\n\n\f4\njobs. The FOMC works hard to differentiate those factors that may have only a\ntemporary impact on the economy or inflation from those of a more sustained nature.\nTemporary disturbances that don’t affect the forecast for inflation and growth over the\ntime horizon that monetary policy affects the economy may not warrant a change in the\ntarget funds rate. But shocks that have a more lasting impact and cause the forecast for\ninflation and growth to deviate significantly from the FOMC’s goals may call for a\nchange in monetary policy.\nThe changes in the fed funds target rate that occurred this fall represent examples of the\nFOMC responding to changes in our assessment of the economic outlook. The revisions\nhave largely been driven by the continued deterioration in the housing market and an\nestimate that weakness would persist longer than previously anticipated. There has also\nbeen some softening of the labor market since the early summer, as I have noted. More\ngenerally, there has been some concern that the strains in financial markets might have\nramifications for the broader economy, although the evidence for that remains limited.\nMarket Turbulence and Financial Stability\nThis brings me back to the issue of financial stability. The disruptions in the financial\nmarkets last August were triggered by the realization that default rates on adjustable-rate\nsubprime mortgages were likely to rise much more than anticipated. The result was that\nmarkets were struggling to reassess the risks of such assets in order to determine an\nappropriate price. The other concern that surfaced was that market participants were\ngenerally unsure about which firms had exposure to these mortgages and to what degree.\nAs a consequence, there was a flight to quality and an associated reluctance to lend to\ninstitutions that were thought to hold these now questionable assets. This price discovery\nprocess is still underway.\nLet me point out that the Federal Reserve cannot resolve this price discovery problem.\nThe markets will have to sort it out. Providing liquidity to the market does not solve the\nfundamental problems of re-pricing risky assets and assessing counterparty risks. A\nnecessary step in restoring both confidence and credibility in the financial system is for\nfinancial institutions to promptly recognize and disclose the extent of their losses. Of\ncourse this is easier said than done, since some of the assets that need revaluing are only\nthinly traded and prices are hard to come by. Nevertheless, write-downs play a necessary\nand important role in restoring the health of financial markets.\nNevertheless, these near-term financial disruptions can make it difficult for certain\nmarkets to function effectively. For example, some financial institutions found it difficult\nto obtain funds in the short-term credit markets because few investors were willing to risk\nthe uncertainty that these institutions might have substantial exposure to the now more\nrisky subprime mortgages. When these institutions could not roll over their short term\ndebt, they faced the problem of having to liquidate longer-lived assets at uncertain or\ndepressed prices.\n\n4\n\n\f5\nThe Federal Reserve’s role when markets become impaired in this way is to lend to banks\nwith good collateral so that the side effects on sound institutions are minimized. This is\nexactly what the Fed did. In August, the Fed reduced the discount rate, which is the\ninterest rate it charges on loans to depository institutions, by 50 basis points and extended\nthe term of those loans to 30 days. The spread between the funds rate and the discount\nrate was thus lowered from 100 basis points to 50 basis points. This increased the\naccessibility and reduced the price of short-term funding to those that needed it. This is a\nperfect example of the appropriate role of the central bank as a lender of last resort.\nThrough most of September and into November, market functioning gradually improved.\nBut in late November, problems reappeared as the interest rate spread between overnight\nmoney and term loans maturing after the New Year increased sharply. While such yearend behavior is not uncommon, the increase this year was much larger than usual as\nfinancial institutions sought to build cushions to guard against further losses while\n“cleaning-up” their balance sheets for end-of-year reporting.\nIn response to this disruption, the Federal Reserve introduced the Term Auction Facility\n(TAF) program. Under the TAF, the Fed auctions term funds with maturities of 28 days\nto depository institutions against the same wide variety of collateral that can be used to\nsecure loans at the Fed’s discount window. By allowing the Fed to inject term funds\nthrough a broader range of counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than\nopen market operations, this facility helps promote the efficient dissemination of liquidity\nat times when the interbank funding markets are under stress and not functioning\nsmoothly.\nThe Fed conducted two successful auctions in December under the TAF, with $20 billion\nauctioned each time. Both auctions were oversubscribed, with a significant number of\nbidders. The interest rates that cleared the auction were between the FOMC’s fed funds\nrate target and the discount rate. Early evidence indicates that there was some narrowing\nof interest rate spreads as a result of these auctions, but I expect there will be further\nanalysis of our experience over time.\nThe key point to take away from this experience with the TAF, however, is that the Fed’s\nactions to improve liquidity in term funding markets did not involve a change in the\nFOMC’s fed funds rate target. That is, the TAF did not change the stance of monetary\npolicy. The Fed actually withdrew funds through open market operations as it injected\nterm liquidity through the TAF. The introduction of the TAF was aimed at addressing\nthe Fed’s objectives for financial stability, not its objectives for monetary policy.\nGoing forward, we must be careful to distinguish when financial conditions call for Fed\nactions to help markets function effectively, such as we are now seeing with the Term\nAuction Facility, as opposed to situations when a change in the overall stance of\nmonetary policy is called for. My approach to making monetary policy decisions is to\nlook at incoming information and ask whether it is consistent with my outlook. So let me\nnow discuss my outlook in more detail.\n\n5\n\n\f6\nThe Outlook\nAs I have already noted, last fall I lowered my projection of economic growth for the\nfourth quarter of 2007 and the first half of 2008. I did so in response to the cumulative\ndeterioration in the housing sector last year along with the potential adverse effects of a\ntightening of credit conditions. In particular, the adjustment to my forecast involved\npushing back the turnaround in residential construction, as low demand for homes meant\nit would take longer than expected to work off the inventories of new and existing homes\nfor sale. The continuing high prices of oil and other commodities also suggested the\npotential for some slowing in the pace of economic activity as well as hinting at\nincreasing inflationary pressures.\nI expect the decline in housing activity will bottom out near the middle of the year.\nResidential investment should then turn slightly positive in the latter part of 2008, for the\nfirst time in more than two years. But I don’t expect significant improvement in the\nhousing sector to become apparent until some time in 2009.\nThe fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 are going to be quite weak; that\nhas been clear for a number of months. My forecast already incorporates the prospect\nthat we will get some bad economic numbers from various sectors of the economy in the\ncoming months. Since monetary policy’s effects on the economy occur with a lag, there\nis little monetary policy can do today to change economic activity in the first half of\n2008.\nThe below-trend growth of the economy in the first half of 2008 will likely mean slower\npayroll employment growth for the first two to three quarters of the year. With slower\njob growth for a time, the unemployment rate may rise somewhat above 5 percent during\nthe course of the year.\nI am still optimistic that the economy will improve appreciably by the third and fourth\nquarters of 2008, and that is when any monetary policy action today will begin to have\nnoticeable effects. Overall real GDP growth will be faster in the second half of 2008 as\nthe economy begins to return to its longer-run trend growth of about 2-3/4 percent. On a\nfourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis, I expect that the economy will grow about 2.5\npercent in 2008, close to its pace in 2007, and that it will be growing more consistently\nnear its longer-term trend in 2009.\nI am concerned that developments on the inflation front will make the Fed’s policy\ndecisions more difficult in 2008. Recent data suggest that inflation is becoming more\nbroad-based. Recent increases do not appear to be solely related to the rise in energy\nprices. Consequently I see more worrisome signs of underlying price pressures.\nAlthough I am expecting slow economic growth for several quarters, we should not rely\non slow growth to reduce inflation. Indeed, the 1970s should be a sufficient reminder\nthat slow growth and falling inflation do not necessarily go hand in hand. Moreover, the\n1990s should remind us that we can have sustained economic growth without generating\ninflation.\n\n6\n\n\f7\n\nAlthough inflationary expectations have crept up only slightly since early September\nbased on inflation-indexed Treasury securities, my sense is that these inflation\nexpectations are more fragile now than they were six months ago. If inflation\nexpectations continue to rise, it will be difficult and costly to the economy to deliver on\nour goal of price stability and puts at risk the Fed’s credibility for maintaining low and\nstable inflation.\nConclusion\nHow does all this get factored into my views about how to approach monetary policy\ndecisions?\nMy approach to making monetary policy decisions is to look at incoming information\nabout the economy and about financial market conditions and ask three questions:\n1) What information is consistent with my current outlook?\n2) What information suggests I need to change my outlook for the economy or\nfor inflation? and\n3) What information indicates the need for further Fed actions to ensure that\nfinancial markets function effectively?\nThe answers to these questions help guide my thinking about how to simultaneously\naddress the Fed’s responsibilities for monetary policy and financial stability.\nTo sum up, I think the U.S. economy will experience several quarters of sluggish growth\nin 2008 before returning to a sustained expansion over the next two years. There are\nrisks to the downside in terms of the possibility of even weaker economic growth. A\nsubstantially weaker outlook than expected, particularly if that weakness is projected to\nbe more prolonged than anticipated, may require further adjustments to policy.\nAt the same time we also face risks of higher inflation. Inflation remains a concern to me\nbecause it is uniquely the Federal Reserve’s responsibility to control it. No other agency\nor policy arm of the government can effectively deliver on the goal of achieving and\nmaintaining a stable price level. Price stability allows the economy to grow at its\nmaximum potential and supports the efficient functioning of our financial markets.\nConsequently, we must remain vigilant on the inflation front and be prepared to act as\nnecessary to avoid the risk of undermining public confidence in the central bank’s\ncommitment to price stability.\nOverall, it should prove to be an interesting and challenging year for policymakers.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "The U.S. Economy: How Fast Can We Grow?\nPresented by Anthony M. Santomero, President\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nCFA Society of Philadelphia\nThe Racquet Club, Philadelphia, PA\nFebruary 23, 2006\n\nIntroduction\nIt is a pleasure to be here today. I always welcome the opportunity to speak with groups like the CFA\nSociety, made up of people who are interested in the state of the economy and who want to learn how it\nmay affect them and their businesses.\nToday, I will share with you my views on the progress and prospects of the U.S. economy. In these types of\ndiscussions, I typically offer my prognosis for how our economy will perform over the next few quarters. But\nas this is my last formal speech as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia — I will be\nstepping down from my position on March 31st — I thought I would take the opportunity to offer you my\nperspective on the economy’s longer run prospects as well.\nSpecifically, I want to focus on one particular question: What is our economy’s growth potential over the next\ndecade or so? This is an important question. The potential growth of output sets the ceiling on achievable\ngrowth in real income. Growth in real income, in turn, determines the growth in real consumption and so, in\nan economic sense, also determines the standard of living that the average American can hope to enjoy.\nBoth demographics and productivity play important roles in determining our nation’s long-run growth\npotential. So I will examine each in turn, assessing their contribution to growth over the past decade and\ntheir likely contribution in the next one. Then I will close with some thoughts on what this analysis implies for\nthe future course of both the economy and monetary policy. But let me begin with a few observations on the\ncurrent state of the economy and the near-term outlook\n\nThe U.S. Economy’s Recent Performance and Near-Term Outlook\nDespite rising energy prices and devastating hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, the U.S. economy performed\nsurprisingly well in 2005. Real GDP increased over 3 percent; payroll employment rose by 2 million; and the\nunemployment rate fell below 5 percent. While growth slowed markedly in the fourth quarter, indications are\nthat the economy is making up much of the lost ground in the current quarter. At the same time, while higher\nenergy prices increased the overall inflation rate last year, so far core inflation remains moderate and\ninflation expectations have remained well contained.\nIn keeping with its intent to support both a sustainable pace of economic expansion and a stable price\nenvironment, the Federal Open Market Committee has continued to move toward a neutral monetary policy\nstance, gradually raising its federal funds rate target to 4-1/2 percent. Looking ahead, the FOMC has\nindicated it will keep a careful eye on the incoming data and continue to make policy adjustments as\nnecessary.\nAs Chairman Bernanke indicated in his congressional testimony last week, FOMC members anticipate real\nGDP growth of about 3-1/2 percent this year and 3 to 3-1/2 percent next year, with core inflation at or below\n2 percent and unemployment at or below 5 percent. I believe that outlook is both plausible and positive, as it\nrepresents a path of sustainable expansion consistent with the economy’s long-run growth potential.\nAnd that brings me to my principal topic today: What is our economy’s growth potential? To telescope my\nanswer, I believe that over the next decade or so, the U.S. economy has the potential for real output growth\nof about 3 percent. For those who long for the 4-percent-plus growth of the late 1990s, this may seem\ndisappointingly low. For those who have noted the gradual deceleration in growth since 2003, it may be\ncomforting to think that growth can remain this high. But from the Fed’s point of view as a policymaker and\n\n\ffrom your point of view as investment advisors, it is important that our assessment of potential growth be\nrealistic and based on economic fundamentals.\n\nThe Determinants of Potential Growth\nHow does one arrive at an appropriate potential growth figure? Economists usually find it useful to break the\npotential growth rate of an economy into two components: the growth rate in the supply of labor, plus the\ngrowth rate in the productivity of labor.\nThe growth rate of the labor supply is largely driven by demographics: the growth rate of the working age\npopulation and the proportion of that population that chooses to join the labor force — the so-called\nparticipation rate. We are in the midst of some substantive changes in these factors right now.\nLabor productivity, in turn, hinges on a wide variety of factors. Some are obvious: workers’ levels of skill\nand knowledge; the stock of physical capital — the machines, buildings, and infrastructure — with which\nthey have to work; and the availability of raw materials, including energy resources. Others are less obvious\nand less tangible: the state of technology; the way business processes are organized; and even the\nstructure of the marketplace itself. As you will see, both the tangible and intangible are important drivers of\nlabor productivity growth.\n\nLong-Run Growth in Labor Supply\nSo, what are the prospects for growth in labor supply in the decade ahead? One thing is certain: the growth\nof labor supply in the U.S. over the next decade will be slower than over the previous decade. The question\nis by how much. The Census Bureau projects that overall population growth in the U.S. will gradually decline\nfrom 1.2 percent per year in the decade of the 1990s to less than 1 percent per year in the current decade,\n1\nand less than 0.7 percent per year by mid-century.\nGrowth in the labor force is likely to slow at least that much, and perhaps even a bit more, because the labor\nforce participation rate peaked in the 1ate 1990s and is likely to be lower over the next decade. Over the\npast 35 years, the overall participation rate climbed from 60 percent of the working age population to over 66\npercent, driven primarily by baby boomers entering their prime working years and by a growing proportion of\nwomen choosing to work outside the home. Now, both of those trends are shifting gears.\nAs with so many aspects of our society, the baby boomers are having a significant effect on the labor supply\nas they move through their life cycle. The Bureau of Labor Statistics considers everyone over the age of 16\nto be part of the working age population. Ages 24 to 54 are considered the prime working years, and\nparticipation rates are highest among people in this age category. Born between 1946 and 1964, the baby\nboomers began entering the labor force during the 1960s and 1970s, and as they moved through their prime\nworking years, they helped boost participation rates through the 1990s. Now, as the boomers begin to move\npast their prime working years, they are contributing to a slowdown in labor force growth.\nHow much of a slowdown we will see as a result of this phenomenon is something of an open question. It\nwill depend on the extent to which baby boomers continue to participate in the labor force. Among the\npopulation age 55 and over, participation rates had been declining steadily, falling from 43 percent during\nthe late 1950s to just 30 percent in the early 1990s. Then, in the late 1990s, just before the baby boomers\nreached this age category, the rate began to increase and has continued to do so. By the end of 2005, the\nparticipation rate for the population age 55 and over had moved up to over 37 percent.\nLikewise, the increase in labor force participation by women across all age categories has had a dramatic\nimpact on the overall participation rate. In 1960, the participation rate for women was 37 percent. By 2000, it\nhad climbed to 60 percent. Since then, it has leveled off at around 59 percent.\nWe have been watching the impact of the baby boom and women in the workplace on the labor supply for a\nlong time. However, two other significant demographic factors have emerged recently.\nOne is the behavior of young people. Labor force participation rates among teenagers and young adults\nhave fallen off sharply. The drop started in early 2001, coinciding with the recession. This was not surprising.\n\n\fParticipation rates are partly cyclical. The surprise is that the participation rates of young people continue to\ndecline even now, several years into the expansion.\nFrom January 2001 to December 2005, the participation rate for people ages 16 to 24 fell from 66 percent to\nless than 61 percent. The drop was even larger for teens between the ages of 16 and 19, where the rate fell\nfrom 52 percent to 43 percent. These declines may be the result of young people recognizing the benefits of\ncontinuing their education and electing to stay in school a while longer. Or it could be the effect of affluence,\nwhereby families and their children can afford greater leisure time. In any case, it is a trend worth watching.\nA second factor getting more attention is the impact of immigration on our labor force. Official population\nprojections assume that the inflow of immigrants to the U.S. will hold steady at about 1 million people per\nyear. If this proves accurate, immigration will contribute progressively less to the percentage growth in our\npopulation. Moreover, since immigrants have relatively high labor force participation rates, the diminution in\nthe percentage growth of our labor force will be even greater.\nPutting all these factors together — slower population growth, an aging baby boom generation, the\nplateauing of women joining the workforce, young people’s delayed entry, and the capping of immigrant\ninflows — growth in our nation’s labor force will almost surely drop below 1 percent in the decade ahead,\nperhaps significantly so.\n\nProductivity Growth\nLet us now turn from growth in the supply of labor to growth in productivity. Labor productivity, simply\ndefined, is output produced per hour worked.\nThe role of productivity growth in fueling strong economic performance has garnered much attention over\nthe past decade, not only among economists but in the news media as well. In the mid-1990s, former Fed\nChairman Greenspan highlighted an acceleration in productivity as an important source of growth, and since\nthen, this previously obscure economic concept has been front-page news — or at least, front-page\nbusiness news.\nThe fact is that labor productivity has accelerated significantly. Indeed, in the past 10 years, productivity has\nincreased by nearly as much as it had in the previous 20. Between 1973 and 1995, labor productivity in the\nU.S. grew at an annual rate of 1.5 percent. Since 1995, it has grown at 2.9 percent annually. Now, of course,\nthe question is: will this rapid rate of productivity growth continue?\nI believe productivity growth will continue to be rapid, though perhaps not quite as rapid as it has been\nrecently, averaging something closer to 2-1/4 percent in the decade ahead. To understand why, it is useful\nto consider the likely future course of several factors contributing to productivity.\nClearly, one of the most important factors behind the recent acceleration in productivity is the revolution in\ninformation technology. I have said this many times before, and I am hardly alone in this assessment.\nHowever, as I indicated a few minutes ago, there are other factors at work as well. Work by a number of\n2\neconomists inside and outside the Fed has helped quantify the contributions of various factors to the\nincrease in productivity growth. I think their estimates provide a useful benchmark.\nThe results suggest that at least half of the recent acceleration in labor productivity is IT-related, and these\ndevelopments have affected overall productivity growth in two ways. First, there was an acceleration in the\nproductivity within the IT sector itself; and second, the gains in this sector enabled an acceleration in the\nproductivity of other sectors as well.\nWithin the IT sector, hardware manufacturers’ ability to deliver computing capacity accelerated dramatically\nafter 1995. The rapid pace of their technological progress was embodied in Moore’s Law, which states that\ncomputer processing power doubles every 18 months.\nWith technology firms producing progressively faster and more powerful computers, the price of computing\npower plummeted. This created the incentive for businesses to invest heavily in IT and use it wherever\n\n\fpossible to increase efficiency and expand capacity. Thus, the productivity boom in IT spread to other\nindustries. They found ways to use IT — including hardware, software, and telecommunications — to\nstreamline supply chains, modernize manufacturing techniques, revamp operations, and in countless other\nways. The IT revolution also allowed for increasingly global markets, which I will talk about in a minute.\nIt would be hard to overstate the contribution of new technology to productivity growth over the past decade.\nAnd it is important to note that productivity gains did not wane during the 2001 recession or the period of\neconomic weakness that followed. Even as business investment spending on high-tech equipment and\nsoftware dried up, labor productivity accelerated as firms found new and more efficient uses of the\ntechnology they had already acquired. In short, as organizations became more familiar with new technology\nand its applications, they were able to use it more and more effectively.\nIT-related gains in productivity are likely to remain substantial in the decade ahead. Industry experts expect\nMoore’s Law will apply for some time before serious constraints begin to arise, so computing capacity will\ncontinue to grow and become less expensive. Moreover, the experience of the past decade suggests that\nproductivity gains accrue to IT users over an extended period through a “learning by doing” channel. So, I\nexpect both the IT sector and the sectors using IT will continue to show strong productivity growth for a long\ntime to come.\nBeyond IT’s demonstrably strong contribution to the recent acceleration in productivity, the contribution to\nother forms of capital has been considerably more modest. While improving labor quality continued to\nincrease productivity over the past 10 years, researchers have been hard pressed to find evidence that it\nhas contributed to its acceleration. So, there is a substantive proportion of the acceleration in productivity\nthat cannot be explained by developments in IT or by the accumulation of other forms of capital or\nimprovements in labor quality.\nNo doubt, some of this unexplained component of our recent productivity growth represents the contribution,\nnot of technology or capital or labor, but rather of the environment in which they operate: the flexibility of the\nmarket structure in the U.S., and the globalization of the marketplace in which the U.S. participates.\nRecent history and research suggest that a crucial determinant of how fast an economy can grow is the way\nits markets are structured. An economy in which property rights are well defined, a reliable rule of law exists,\ninformation flows freely, and market participants can respond freely to changing conditions fosters resilience,\ninnovation, and entrepreneurship. These features, in turn, increase the economy’s growth potential.\nThe resiliency of our markets and our ability to adjust to different economic circumstances are truly\nremarkable. I have been on record discussing this resiliency many times during my tenure as president of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Just over the past five years, our economy has adjusted to the\nbursting of the tech bubble, 9/11, corporate scandals, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a sharp rise in energy\nprices, and three devastating hurricanes.\nThe United States has long had the basic elements of a free market in place, but the capacity of those\nmarkets continues to evolve, and we continue to reap the benefits. Looking ahead, I expect that the flexibility\nand resiliency of our markets will continue to improve, fostering responses to new situations and new\nopportunities that maximize our economy’s productive capacity.\nThe globalization of our marketplace is an important source of opportunity that has been developing rapidly\nin recent years. In fact, I believe increased globalization has become an important driver of productivity\ngrowth for the United States.\nEconomists have long touted the gains from trade. The great classical economist David Ricardo famously\nexpounded his theory of comparative advantage nearly 200 years ago. That theory, simple as it seems, is\nstill powerful and relevant. Free trade allows economies to specialize in producing the goods and services in\nwhich they are most proficient, then trade among themselves to get the goods and services they want. So,\nby producing high-tech equipment and software here at home and trading for textiles and other consumer\ngoods from abroad, people in the U.S. can enjoy a higher standard of living than if we used our own\n\n\fresources, labor, and capital to produce goods and services at which we are, comparatively speaking, less\nproficient. To put this in the context of my discussion today, free trade raises our productivity.\nThis is not to deny the reality that in a dynamic marketplace comparative advantage shifts, sometimes\ndramatically, imposing painful adjustments on workers engaged in the industries affected. If the gains from\ntrade are real, and I believe they are, it is in everyone’s best interests to use some of those gains to help\ndisplaced workers make the necessary adjustments — whether through education and training or help with\nrelocation or job placement.\nThe move toward free trade and a more global economy has been underway for some time, and it has\npicked up some momentum of late. In fact, tariffs and other trade barriers have been trending down since\nthe end of World War II. All of these developments have increased the productive potential of the U.S.\neconomy overall while simultaneously increasing the stress experienced in many industries.\nMy hope is that we will do what is necessary to galvanize support for free trade and open markets, so that\nas the process of globalization continues, the U.S. will take full advantage of the opportunity it affords for\ngreater productivity and higher living standards.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Potential Output Growth\nTo return to my opening question, what does all this mean for potential growth in the U.S. economy over the\nnext decade? Let’s do the math. The demographics suggest that our labor force will grow by about ¾ to 1\npercent per year. With the IT revolution continuing and a flexible U.S. economy operating in a more global\nmarketplace, I expect labor productivity to grow by around 2-1/4 percent per year. These estimates imply a\npotential for output growth of about 3 percent per year on a sustained basis.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nI believe the economy is on course to converge smoothly to a pace of 3 percent growth in the near term. The\neconomy is performing well. The expansion is moving ahead at a moderate pace, and the economy now\nseems to be close to full employment. The outlook is for real GDP growth to moderate a bit further over the\ncourse of this year and next, settling into that sustainable pace of 3 percent annual growth.\nI believe this rate of growth is consistent with the Fed maintaining a neutral monetary policy. We have been\nmoving monetary policy toward neutrality for some time, and our policy appears to be close to neutral now. It\nis imperative that the Federal Reserve remain vigilant to signs of inflation, but I believe that it is now\nappropriate to allow incoming data on inflation and economic growth to guide our policy adjustments going\nforward.\nI am optimistic that the U.S. economy is poised for a sustained period of economic expansion, marked by full\nemployment, low inflation, and relatively stable interest rates. Having said this, I will close with two cautions:\none against overreaching, the other against overreacting.\nFirst, monetary policymakers must guard against overreaching. Some may see the trend toward output\ngrowth of 3 percent as a failure of policy. But if the estimates above are correct, it is not. The economy must\nbe allowed to move along its path of potential growth if we are to achieve monetary policy’s dual mandate of\nsustainable growth and price stability. Attempts to maintain consistently higher growth than this will only\nproduce inflationary pressures and erode the price stability that is monetary policy’s most important\ncontribution to macroeconomic stability.\nA second caution is that monetary policymakers must guard against overreacting. We know that while the\ntransition to potential growth may be smooth in principle, it will not be quite so smooth in reality. If there is\none thing we have learned over this cycle it is that the unexpected always occurs, and, at least in the short\nterm, growth rates vary from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter accordingly.\nNonetheless, appropriate monetary policy, coupled with reasonable expectations for output growth, will help\ndiminish that volatility. We have seen evidence of this already in what has been called “the great\nmoderation.” The U.S. economy has shown markedly less volatility over the past two decades of price\n\n\f3\n\nstability than it had previously in the postwar period. As a central banker, I attribute this in large measure to\nthe pursuit of a monetary policy appropriately responsive to economic conditions, yet steadfastly focused on\nestablishing a stable price environment. I hope, and fully expect, that the Fed will continue on that course.\nWith that, I will close. I have enjoyed spending time with you today and thank you for being here. I would be\nhappy to take your questions.\nTim Schiller, \"After the Baby Boom: Population Trends and the Labor Force of the Future,\" Business Review,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Fourth Quarter 2005.\nJorgenson, Dale W., Mun S.
