        "content": "State of the Texas Economy: An Annual Update\n(With Reference to Gen. Sheridan and John Steinbeck)\n\nRemarks before the Dallas Breakfast Group\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nDecember 19, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fState of the Texas Economy: An Annual Update\n(With Reference to Gen. Sheridan and John Steinbeck)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Margaret [Keliher].\nToday I am going to talk about one subject only: the Texas economy. As you know, just\nyesterday I was in Washington for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nAt the end of the meeting, a statement was issued as to what that committee consisting of the 12\nFederal Reserve Bank presidents and six members of the Fed’s Board of Governors decided\nregarding the course of monetary policy; Chairman Bernanke followed with a press conference.\nIn keeping with our tradition, this morning I will refrain from commenting on the decisions\nmade. We are under a self-imposed “communication blackout” regarding our views about\nmacroeconomic developments or monetary policy issues until after midnight tonight. So if you\nwish, call me at home at 12:01 tomorrow morning and ... incur the eternal wrath of my wife,\nNancy!\nSome of you have undoubtedly heard Gen. Philip Sheridan’s notable expression, “If I owned\nTexas and hell, I would rent out Texas and live in hell.” Although he reportedly recanted his\nstatement, even a man as renowned for his cruelty as Gen. Sheridan would certainly have\nchanged his opinion if he were around today. It wouldn’t have taken him long after crossing the\nriver Styx to realize that rather than renting out Texas he would have been better off purchasing\nevery bit of it. His return on investment would have been astronomical. My hunch is that\nSheridan would want to live in Texas with you and me and would seek to rent out hell—perhaps\nto the U.S. Congress, though it would have to be free of charge given their fiscal predicament!\n\nThe Success of the Lone Star State\nHere’s why I believe Texas is attractive to even the Gen. Sheridans of the world. The state’s total\noutput—the equivalent of gross domestic product—is approximately $1.4 trillion, in the\nneighborhood of countries like Australia and Spain. We produce more oil than Venezuela or\nNorway and more natural gas than Canada or all 28 countries of the European Union combined.\nAnd we produce jobs like gee-whiz. A job is the source of income and the root of security and\nwealth for a productive people. Without income a person cannot consume and invest, engaging\nthe engines of economic growth. Most importantly, a job is the route to dignity as we have\nhistorically defined it in America.\n\n1\n\n\fJobs, Jobs, Jobs\nFor the past 23 years, Texas has outpaced the country in job creation by a factor of more than 2to-1. Here is a slide that shows the percentage increase in jobs created by several large states and\nfor the U.S. as a whole since 1990:\n\nTotal Nonagricultural Employment Since 1990\nin Selected States\nIndex, January 1990 = 100\n170\nTexas\n\n160\n150\n\nFlorida\n140\n130\n\nU.S.\n\n120\n\nCalifornia\nIllinois\n\n110\n100\n\nNew York\n\nMichigan\n\n90\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nNote the dotted black line drawn from the base of 100 in 1990. For the residents of the home of\nMotown or the Empire State or the Land of Lincoln, this graph does not present a happy picture.\nSince 1990, total employment growth in Michigan has been 5 percent, a compound annual\ngrowth rate of 0.17 percent, a pace that is one-twelfth that of Texas over the same period. New\nYork and Illinois have not fared much better.\nIf you zoom in on the period since the onset of the financial crisis, you can see an even greater\ndisparity in employment growth trends for Texas vis-à-vis the other large U.S. states:\n\n2\n\n\fTotal Nonagricultural Employment in Selected\nStates Since the Recession Began\nIndex, December 2007 = 100\n108\n\nTexas\n\n106\n104\nNew York\n\n102\n100\n\nU.S.\n98\n96\nIllinois\nCalifornia\nMichigan\nFlorida\n\n94\n92\n90\n88\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nIn terms of jobs, Texas was one of the last states to lose ground during the recession and then led\nthe pack in punching through employment levels that prevailed at the end of 2007. Fortunately,\nall of the selected states shown in the chart appear to be recovering, albeit rather slowly, from\nlicks taken during the crisis. However, even the Empire State can’t compare, despite its devotees\nof the perspective captured by Saul Steinberg’s iconic 1976 cover of New Yorker, “View of the\nWorld from Ninth Avenue,” depicting everything west of the Hudson River as a vast wasteland.\nCompared to the view in 1976, Texas stands tall above all the rest. Why is that?\n\nWhy Are Things Bigger (or Better) in Texas?\nMy friends in New York and other foreign places often criticize the relative success of the Lone\nStar State. They like to argue that Texas may well be creating more employment, but it is just\nlow-wage jobs—the kind nobody wants. Well, truth be told, while low-wage jobs grow faster in\nTexas than elsewhere, so do all other jobs. As this next slide makes very clear, Texas also leads\nthe rest of the nation in creating middle-income and high-wage jobs:\n\n3\n\n\fJob Growth by Wage Quartile,\n2001-12\nPercent change\n30\n26.1\n\n25.6\n25\nTexas\n\n20\n15\n\nU.S. minus Texas\n14.1\n\n12.6\n\n10\n\n7.3\n\n5.6\n5\n1.2\n0\n-5\n\n-4.1\n\n-10\nLowest wage quartile\n\nLower-middle wage\nquartile\n\nUpper-middle wage\nquartile\n\nHighest wage quartile\n\nNOTES: Calculations include all workers over age 15 with positive wages. Wage quartiles constructed based on\n2012 Current Population Survey (CPS), which refers to 2011 wages.\nSOURCE: March CPS, 2001, 2012.\n\nThe U.S. ex-Texas has seen net job destruction for middle wage earners over the past decade.\nMeanwhile, Texas has experienced robust job creation for these important middle-income\nworkers. Texas has not been immune to growing income inequality or the larger issue of labor\nmarket polarization, but the notion that Texas only creates minimum wage jobs is a myth.\n\nDiversification Helps\nAnother Texas-growth-miracle fable I enjoy debunking goes like this: All of our state’s job and\nwealth creation comes from the booming energy industry. At the Dallas Fed, we account for the\ninfluence of oil and gas on our state’s welfare: Oil and gas extraction and mining directly employ\n2.5 percent of our workforce—two-point-five percent. And the energy sector’s total contribution\nto our state’s total output is roughly 11 percent. So, yes, it is true: We have a strong energy sector\nin Texas. We are the No. 1 producer of oil and gas in the nation. I already mentioned that we\nproduce more oil than Venezuela and more natural gas than Canada.\nOn net, high energy prices do, indeed, benefit Texans. But look at this slide of the number and\ndiversity of jobs created by sector thus far in 2013. The vertical axis is the number of jobs\ncreated in thousands; the horizontal axis denotes the various job categories and, in parentheses,\nthe share of total jobs represented by each category:\n\n4\n\n\f2013 Employment Growth in Texas\nThousands of jobs\n50\n45.3\n43.3\n45\n\nYear-to-date (Oct. 2013) total jobs gained in Texas = 221,300\n\n38.2\n\n40\n35\n\n29.7\n\n30\n25\n\n19.1\n\n20\n\n17.6\n13.7\n\n15\n\n8.4\n\n10\n\n4.2\n\n5\n0\n\nTrade,\nTransp &\nUtilities\n(20.0%)\n\nLeisure &\nHospitality\n(10.2%)\n\nProf. &\nBusiness\nServices\n(13.1%)\n\nEducational\nOil & Gas\n& Health Construction Extraction\nServices\nand Mining\n(5.5%)\n(13.4%)\nSupport\n(2.5%)\n\nFinancial\nActivities\n(6.1%)\n\nInformation\n(1.8%)\n\n3.3\n\nGov’t Manufacturing\n(7.8%)\n(16.0%)\n\nNOTES: Categories are North American Industry Classification System supersectors. Data seasonally adjusted.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nOil and gas and mining and their support services accounted for 17,600 jobs, or 8 percent, of the\n221,300 positions created in Texas in January through October of this year. Of course, the oil\nand gas sector has large multipliers, so the overall economic impact is greater than just these\n17,600 jobs. For example, a University of Texas at San Antonio study estimates that the Eagle\nFord Shale generated over $61 billion in economic impact and supported 116,000 jobs in 2012.\nAnd this is just one of four important oil and natural gas producing regions in the Eleventh\nFederal Reserve District that the shale boom has significantly affected. In 2012, the Permian\nBasin, Barnett, Haynesville and Eagle Ford accounted for 25 percent of U.S. oil supply and 28\npercent of U.S. natural gas supply. 1\nObviously, the oil patch has been a boon to Texas growth. But in 2013, trade, transportation and\nutilities accounted for 45,300 jobs; leisure and hospitality, 43,300; professional and business\nservices, 38,200; educational and health services, 29,700; and construction, 19,100. As this chart\nshows, oil and gas is but the sixth strongest source of job creation. Ours is a diversified economy,\ncreating jobs across the spectrum and in all income categories.\n\nBlessed to Be in Texas\nHere are some other facts and figures that help round out the economic picture of our state.\nIn the housing sector, Texas largely avoided the housing boom and bust that struck most of the\nnation. We did not experience a housing bubble:\n\n5\n\n\fU.S. and Texas Housing Prices\nHouse Price Index, Q1 1991=100*\n240\n\n220\n\n200\n\n180\nTX\nU.S.\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n* FHFA Purchase-Only House Price Index, which relies on actual home purchase prices, not appraised values.\nSOURCE: Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).\n\nNor did we suffer a housing bust:\n\nTexas Did Not Have a Housing Bust:\nAnnualized Change in FHFA House Price Index 2006-2011\n\nIt helped that a 1997 amendment to the Texas Constitution allowed home equity loans and cashout refinancing for the first time in the state’s history, but limited the amount of total debt (new\nloan plus the first mortgage) to no more than 80 percent of a home’s value. Combined with other\n6\n\n\ffactors such as ample land availability and fewer development and zoning restrictions, Texas\nhousing stock increased during the last decade’s national boom without the rapidly rising home\nprices experienced elsewhere. With borrowing under control and house prices relatively stable,\nthe state escaped the brunt of the housing sector fallout and experienced relatively few\nunderwater mortgages:\n\nTexas’ Lower Share of Underwater Mortgages\nPercent of mortgages with balance > home value*\n40\n\n36\n\n35\n\n32\n\n30\n25\n\n25\n\n23\n\n20\n15\n\n15\n\n15\n10\n4\n\n5\n0\nNevada\n\nFlorida\n\nArizona\n\nMichigan\n\nCalifornia\n\nTexas\n\nU.S.\n\n* As of second quarter 2013.\nSOURCE: CoreLogic.\n\nAs to the sector we at the Dallas Fed supervise directly, fewer Texas banks have suffered net\nlosses than in the rest of the nation:\n\nShare of Banks that Are Unprofitable:\nU.S. and 11th District\nPercent of Banks Reporting a Net Loss\n35\n31\n30\n\nU.S.\n\n11th District\n\n25\n22\n20\n15\n\n14\n\n15\n\n13\n10\n\n10\n7\n6\n5\n0\n\n7\n4\n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 *\n* YTD through third quarter 2013.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\n7\n\n\f¡Viva Méxicoǃ\nLast, Texas is blessed to have a great neighbor to the immediate south. The Mexican economy\nhas a significant impact on our state; a fortunate development for us, given that its economy is\nbeing transformed to a greater degree than most people here in El Norte realize. Admittedly,\nMexico hit a rough patch in the first half of this year, but the Dallas Fed sees this as largely due\nto transitory factors.\nIt is surprising to many that Mexico recovered more quickly from the Great Recession than the\nUnited States. Inflation in Mexico has reached record lows after trending down for two decades\nfollowing important reforms: central bank independence in 1994 and adoption of inflation\ntargeting in 2001. Relatively low inflation, together with a stable peso, has protected the\npurchasing power of the Mexican consumer and allowed income and savings to grow. Further,\nafter its horrific banking crisis in 1994–95 and an ensuing decade of stagnant lending, Mexico’s\nbanking industry is well capitalized and growing again, and financial access, while still limited,\nis expanding quickly.\nMexico has also remained a staunch proponent of free trade. Exports and imports now make up\n62 percent of Mexican economic output versus 17.5 percent as recently as 1980. Since Mexico\njoined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the forerunner of the World Trade\nOrganization) in 1986 and ratified the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, it has\nforged 12 trade pacts with 44 nations.\nOn the fiscal front, Mexico’s 2012 budget deficit was a respectable 2.6 percent of GDP, which\ncompares with 7 percent here. For all their differences, Mexican lawmakers have a commitment\nto fiscal discipline. They adopted a balanced-budget rule in 2006 and have chosen to abide by it\nrather than take the “kick-the-can-down-the-road” approach.\nWith all the progress in the macroeconomy, banking, finance and trade, structural reforms are\nwhat Mexico now needs to catapult to a leadership role among emerging-market economies.\nPresident Peña Nieto appears to be doing just that, pushing forward with structural\nmodernization. Mexico might best be described, in economic parlance, as an “emerged country.”\n\nExports, Exports, Exports\nTexas benefits from a stronger Mexico in many ways, including on the export front. Here is a\npicture of the export growth from our trade relationships with our increasingly successful\nsouthern neighbor, as well as our other major trading partners:\n\n8\n\n\fTexas Export Growth\nIndex, Jan. 2000=100*\n240\nOther\n\n220\n\n2013:Q3\n\n18%\n\nMexico\nCanada\n\n200\n\n15%\n\n3%\n11%\n\nTexas\n\n8%\n\nEuropean Union\n\n180\n\nAsia, excl. China\n\n160\n\nLatin America, excl.\nMexico\nChina\n\n9%\n36%\n\n140\n120\nU.S. minus Texas\n100\n80\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n* Real, seasonally adjusted.\nSOURCES: Census Bureau; World Institute for Strategic Economic Research; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nOne noticeable takeaway from this Texas export chart is the difference in the trajectory of the red\nand blue lines. Since the beginning of 2009, Texas exports have grown more than 70 percent\nwhile the nation’s exports, sans Texas, have increased at half that pace and are only now back to\nprerecession levels.\n\nA Great Place for Immigrants\nOf course, not every facet of the Texas economy is as supportive of the economic narrative\nexpressed by the previous charts. Texas lags most other states in social services. We are the\nantithesis of the welfare state. And yet, if you believe people vote with their feet and put their\nmoney where their mouth is, the balance Texas has struck between job creation and social\nservices seems appropriate enough to attract the diaspora from the other mega-states. We draw\nmassive inflows of business investment, and we attract significant numbers of newcomers. In\nrecent years, Texas has consistently welcomed more migrants—foreign and domestic—than any\nother state. 2\nDomestic migration is a brain and human-resource gain for Texas and corresponding drain from\nsending states. Texas transplants have higher levels of education than native Texans and fill key\nniches in the high-skilled labor force. Since 2004, California has been the largest sending state\nby far—nearly one-quarter of net domestic migration to Texas between 2006 and 2012 came\nfrom California. In fact, so many Californians have been moving to Texas in recent years that the\nprice of a one-way, 26-foot U-Haul rental truck from San Francisco to San Antonio is over twice\nthe price for the same truck traveling in the opposite direction.\n\n9\n\n\fTop Sending States for Migration to Texas\nCalifornia\n23%\nOther\n33%\n\nFlorida\n9%\n\nTennessee\n3%\nNorth Carolina\n3%\nNew Jersey\n4%\nArizona\n4%\n\nNew York\n7%\n\nAlaska\n4%\n\nMichigan\n4%\n\nIllinois\n6%\n\nSOURCE: 2006-12 American Community Survey.\n\nMany of the high-skilled migrants coming to our state are drawn to the high-tech, health care,\nprofessional and business services, and energy sectors in the fast-growing “Texas Triangle”\ncities—Austin, Houston and Dallas–Fort Worth. Internal Revenue Service tax records suggest\nthat over 80 percent of taxpayers who moved into Texas during 2000–10 flowed into these three\nmetropolitan areas, which also experienced significant inflows from other parts of Texas.\nThus, it comes as no surprise that these major metros have been huge contributors to the state’s\nstrong overall employment growth. Year-to-date through October, Dallas–Fort Worth has added\n87,400 jobs. The DFW metro area has maintained a year-over-year annual growth rate greater\nthan 2 percent since January 2011 (34 months and counting). Due south, down Interstate 45,\nthere’s a new Houstonian every four minutes, given current in-migration and net population\ngrowth trends. Houstonians are also on a homebuying tear; this year the pace has averaged one\nhome sale every six minutes. In summary, Texas is attracting bright minds and eager workers\nfrom across the nation, and we are all better off for it.\n\nAnd You Can’t Fault the Fed\nThere are many reasons that Texas is outpacing the nation in terms of economic growth. But one\nthing I can tell you with absolute certainty is that the underperformance of other large states, like\nCalifornia, relative to Texas has nothing to do with Federal Reserve policy. After all, Texas is\nsubject to the same monetary policy as California and the other states of the union. Texans pay\nsimilar interest rates on mortgages and on commercial and industrial and consumer loans. We\noperate under the same federal regulatory regime governing banks and financial institutions and\ncompete in the same financial markets as the rest of the nation.\n10\n\n\fSo what gives? If my charts did not impress you, then perhaps the economic miracle of Texas\ncan be best explained by John Steinbeck’s account of his travels across America with his poodle,\nCharley, in 1960:\nI have said that Texas is a state of mind, but I think it is more than that. It is a\nmystique closely approximating a religion. And this is true to the extent that\npeople either passionately love Texas or passionately hate it and, as in other\nreligions, few people dare to inspect it for fear of losing their bearings in mystery\nor paradox. But I think there will be little quarrel with my feeling that Texas is\none thing. For all its enormous range of space, climate, and physical appearance,\nand for all the internal squabbles, contentions, and strivings, Texas has a tight\ncohesiveness perhaps stronger than any other section of America. Rich, poor,\nPanhandle, Gulf, city, country, Texas is the obsession, the proper study, and the\npassionate possession of all Texans. 3\nSteinbeck nailed it. Above all, Texas is a state of mind where people are ready to work and get\nthings done for the betterment of their families, communities, cities and beyond. We should be\nproud, indeed, to call the Lone Star State our home. 4\nI usually end my speeches by saying “In the great tradition of central bankers, I would now be\nhappy to avoid answering your questions.” But given that monetary policy is off limits this\nmorning, and I am never shy on Texas brag, I’d be glad to answer any and all of the questions\nyou might have.\n\nThank you.\n\n11\n\n\fNOTES\n1\n\nFor more information on the shale boom in the Eleventh District, see\nwww.dallasfed.org/research/econdata/energy.cfm.\n2\nFor an excellent report on how immigration affects the Texas economy, see “Gone to Texas:\nImmigration and the Transformation of the Texas Economy,” by Pia M.

        "content": "Comments on Monetary Policy\n(With Praise for Urban Lehner, Norman Borlaug and Dentists)\n\nRemarks before the DTN/The Progressive Farmer Ag Summit 2013\n\nRichard W. Fisher\n\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nChicago\nDecember 9, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fComments on Monetary Policy\n(With Praise for Urban Lehner, Norman Borlaug and Dentists)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Urban (Lehner).\nI lived in Tokyo for much of 1990, when Urban was bureau chief of the Wall Street\nJournal there. He taught me Japan, steering me away from then-stereotypical views\nharbored by American analysts and guiding me through a deep dive into Japanese\nliterature and history that later served me well when I was deputy U.S. trade\nrepresentative and negotiated with the Japanese. Only Urban Lehner could have authored\na masterpiece like “Let’s Talk Turkey About Japanese Turkeys and Other Tales….”1 His\ndeep understanding of the uniqueness of Japan is impressive, as is his work the past\ndecade as a discerning editor of DTN/The Progressive Farmer. Thank you, Urban, for\nyour friendship and insights.\nIn Praise of Norman Borlaug\nYou might wonder why I so readily accepted Urban’s invitation to speak to this great\ngroup of farm and agriculture leaders on a cold December day. Typically, I and my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) defer to my respected\ncolleague, Esther George, the president of the Kansas City Fed, and her able staff for\ncommentary on developments in agriculture. I promise the rapidity of my acceptance of\nUrban’s invitation to speak to you has little to do with my eagerness to see the Dallas\nCowboys manhandle the Bears tonight at Soldier Field. But my link to you and to\nagriculture actually does come from sports: from Little League baseball rather than NFL\nfootball.\nAs Urban mentioned, I grew up in Mexico City. I played Little League there for the\nLeones (the Lions). My coach was Norman Borlaug. I doubt there is a person in this\nroom who doesn’t know and revere that name. Back in 1970, when the Nobel committee\nawarded the Peace Prize based on proven success and true merit, I believe their citation\nprovided the best summary of Norman Borlaug’s contribution to mankind: “More than\nany other single person of this age,” the Nobel committee declared, “he has helped\nprovide bread for a hungry world” with his development of genetically unique strains of\n“semi-dwarf” wheat.2 I don’t think one can overstate what Norman Borlaug’s “green\nrevolution” accomplished: He saved billions of people from starvation by applying\nscience to agriculture.\n\n\fBorlaug developed those wheat strains working in Mexico with a grant from the\nRockefeller Foundation. When he wasn’t in the lab or out in the field, or letting his son\nBilly and me ride with him on his tractor, he coached me in Mexico City’s Little League.\nI stayed in close touch over the years with the Borlaugs and often spoke of my coach at\nour family dinner table. One year, he came to my daughter Alison’s school, Hockaday in\nDallas, to speak at a lower-school assembly. The headmistress began by asking if any of\nthe girls knew why Mr. Borlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize. Alison’s hand shot up.\nShe thought it was “for coaching Little League baseball.”\nNorman Borlaug died on Sept. 12, 2009. That very day, another of our little cadre of\ngringos who grew up in Mexico City, Professor Bill Raun of Oklahoma State University,\nwas visiting his idol and showing him the latest version of a handheld device he had\ndeveloped called the GreenSeeker. The sensor could be used by any farmer in the field to\neasily determine how much fertilizer and nitrogen to properly apply.3 Borlaug approved.\nIn fact, the very last words he uttered before passing away were “Take it to the farmer.”\nI am honored that you have given me the chance to “take it to the farmer” by speaking\nhere today.\nIn Ag, the Cure for High Prices Is … High Prices\nBefore joining the Fed, as mentioned by Urban, I spent four years as deputy U.S. trade\nrepresentative and countless hours trying to settle vexing ag trade disputes not only with\nthe Japanese but with many other countries. So if you permit me to nostalgically stray\nfrom my current role as a central banker, I am going to take the liberty of speaking briefly\nto recent developments in agriculture before providing my personal perspective on the\noutlook for the economy and monetary policy.\nWe are seeing a significant and sustained correction in the price of wheat and corn. I\nexpect soybeans to follow, as well as the sources of animal protein created from these\nbasic plant-food stocks. We have had bumper crops of wheat and corn and huge plantings\nof soy. When I say “we,” I am referring not just to the United States but to what I call the\nglobalized breadbasket, which consists of the United States, the Black Sea area, Canada,\nAustralia, Latin America and other growing areas that have responded with prodigious\noutput to high prices that prevailed for a sustained period. These are elevated prices that\nhave popularly been attributed to surging demand from China and others that have moved\nup the protein ladder as they have achieved greater prosperity in the post-Cold War, postMao Zedong world.\n\n\fFrom an economic standpoint, there are lessons to be learned here. First, the farmer’s rule\nof thumb on price movements still obtains: The cure for high prices is high prices. As\nnight follows day, farmers, aided today by successive iterations of Norman Borlaug’s\ninnovations and new, easy-to-use technological achievements like Bill Raun’s, will\nrespond to demand-pull inflation in crop prices with greater plantings and harvests, often\nto the point of overshooting. This is no doubt a phenomenon you will be pursuing at this\nsummit on “Tactics to Tame Volatility.”\nAs you consider potential tactics, I hope you will keep the following in mind:\na) Free trade is essential for farmers everywhere. Protectionism is the surest path to\neconomic hell. We want a global breadbasket, and we want U.S. farmers and all\nthose interests in the U.S. who make it possible to till fields everywhere—from\nour great machinery makers to our fertilizer and agribusiness firms—to be able to\ncompete in every market worldwide as well as with foreign companies in our own\nmarket. Competition sharpens wits and strengthens muscles. In an openly\ncompetitive world, I have no doubt our producers and companies will continually\noutperform others.\nb) It is important that Borlaug’s revolution of genetic modification be responsibly\ncarried forward. Otherwise, the freer-trade regime that has been achieved can be\nthreatened. Or be exploited so as to instill protectionism. I am thinking\nparticularly of the current situation of the millions of tons of corn currently sitting\noff China’s shores, held out of the Chinese market ostensibly because of its GMO\n(genetically modified organism) characteristics, despite its acceptance in other\nmajor markets, including our own. I have no desire to enter into any argument\nwith greens and environmentalists; I simply wish to suggest that you might\nconsider ways to reach internationally agreed-upon standards for GMO\nenhancement.\nI would add a “c,” a third point for you to bear in mind: You had all better use to the good\nthis unusual period in economic history of proactively accommodative monetary policy\nby the Federal Reserve and other major central banks. The FOMC has made money the\ncheapest and most widely available of any time in American history. Interest rates dipped\nto their lowest level in 237 years; bond and stock markets rallied to historic highs in both\nnominal and real terms; bankers and investors are flush with liquidity; for anybody who\nis creditworthy, money is über-abundant. This will not last forever. One would be foolish\nnot to exploit it now.\n\n\fThe Course of Monetary Policy\nIn discussing the course of monetary policy, I can only speak to my own views.\nAs Urban mentioned, I will be a voter on the FOMC next year. I am happy to lay out for\nyou my perspective. It is this: In my view, the Federal Reserve has supplied more than\nsufficient liquidity to fuel economic recovery above and beyond a reduction of\nunemployment from its current level of 7 percent. As I just said, money is cheap and\nliquidity is abundant. Indeed, it is coursing over the gunwales of the ship of our economy,\nplacing us at risk of becoming submerged in financial shenanigans rather than in\nconducting business based on fundamentals.\nMonetary Policy Rendered Flaccid\nTo be sure, the job creators in our economy—private companies—have used this period\nof accommodative monetary policy to clean up the liability side of their balance sheets\nand fine-tune their bottom lines by buying shares and increasing dividends. They have\nalso continued achieving productivity enhancement and relentless reduction in SG&A\n(selling, general and administrative expenses). Running tight ships, they are now poised\nto hire as they become more confident about nonmonetary matters that remain\nunresolved.\nI used to say that the United States was the best-looking horse in the global glue factory.\nNow, I firmly believe we are the most fit stallion or filly on the global racetrack: Our\ncompanies are the most financially prepared and most productively operated they have\nbeen at any time during the nearly four decades since I graduated from business school.\nWhat is holding them back is not the cost or the availability of credit and finance. What is\nholding them back is fiscal and regulatory policy that is, at best, uncertain, and at worst,\ncounterproductive.\nAgainst that background, I believe that the current program of purchasing $85 billion per\nmonth in U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities comes at a cost that far exceeds\nits purported benefits. Presently, there is no private or public company that I know of,\nincluding many CCC-rated credits, that does not now have access to sufficient, cheap\ncapital. There is no private or public company I know of that considers monetary policy\nto be deficient. Instead, to a company, every CEO I talk to feels that uncertainty derived\nfrom fiscal policy and regulatory interference is the key government-induced deterrent to\nmore robust economic growth and profitability.\nThe FOMC has helped enable a sharp turn in the housing market and roaring stock and\nbond markets. I would argue that the former benefited the middle-income quartiles, while\n\n\fthe latter has primarily benefited the rich and the quick. Though the recent numbers are\nencouraging, easy money has failed to encourage the robust payroll expansion that is the\nbasis for the sustained consumer demand on which our economy depends. It cannot do so\nin and of itself. Without fiscal policy that incentivizes rather than discourages U.S. capex\n(capital expenditure), this accommodative monetary policy aimed at reducing\nunemployment (especially structural unemployment) or improving the quality of jobs is\nrendered flaccid and less than optimally effective. And as to the housing markets, prices\nare now appreciating to levels that may be hampering affordability in many markets.\nWhat About Inflation?\nAs to the issue of inflation, the run rate for personal consumption expenditure (PCE)\nprices in the third quarter was 2 percent, according to recently revised data. The Dallas\nFed computes a Trimmed Mean analysis of the PCE, which we feel provides a more\naccurate view of inflationary developments. The 12-month run rate for the Trimmed\nMean PCE has been steady at 1.3 percent for the past seven months.\nAs measured by surveys and financial market indicators, expected inflation five or more\nyears out is anchored firmly at levels consistent with the 2 percent rate that modern\ncentral bankers now cotton to as appropriate. These surveys and indicators also show\nexpected price increases over 2014 only modestly below 2 percent.\nAgainst this background, I am not of the school of thought that monetary policy need\ncontinue to be hyperaccommodative or be made even more so in order to bring mediumterm inflation expectations closer to target. I certainly don’t see any justification for\nseeking to raise medium-term expectations above 2 percent as an inducement for\nbusinesses to pour on capex and expand payrolls or for policy to act as an incentive for\nconsumers to go out and spend more money now rather than later. To me, this would just\nundermine the slowly improving confidence we have begun to see.\nEspecially given that we have a surfeit of excess liquidity sloshing about in the system,\nthe idea of ramping up inflation expectations from their current tame levels strikes me as\nshort-sighted and even reckless. We already have enough kindling for potential long-term\ninflation, which will sorely test our capacity to manage policy going forward. I do not\nwish to add further wood to that pile.\n\n\fIt Is Time to Taper\nIn my view, we at the Fed should begin tapering back our bond purchases at the earliest\nopportunity. To enable the markets to digest this change of course with minimal\ndisruption, we should do so within the context of a clearly articulated, well-defined\ncalendar for reducing purchases on a steady path to zero. We should make clear that,\nbarring some serious economic crisis, we will stay the course of reduction rather than\ngive an imprecise nod as we did after the May and June meetings that led markets to\nbelieve the program might end as unemployment reached 7 percent.\nOnly then can we at the Fed return to focusing on management of the overnight rate that\nanchors the yield curve. To be sure, we may wish to keep overnight rates low for a\nprolonged period, depending on economic developments. But we need to return to\nconducting monetary policy that is more in keeping with the normal role of a central\nbank. We need to break away from trying to manipulate term premia and stop prolonging\nthe distortions that accrue from our massive long-term bond purchases and the risks we\nincur in building an ever-expanding balance sheet that is now approaching $4 trillion.\nBecoming Dentists Once Again\nI consider this strategy desirable on its own merit: I would feel more comfortable were\nwe to remove ourselves as soon as possible from interfering with the normal price-setting\nfunctioning of financial markets. And I consider it desirable from the standpoint of\nprotecting our limited franchise. As Chairman (Ben) Bernanke has pointed out politely,\nand I have argued less diplomatically, good monetary policy is necessary—but certainly\nnot sufficient—to return the nation to full employment. Acting as though we can go it\nalone only builds expectations that far exceed our capacity. And it could lead us to\nbelieve that we have a greater capacity to control economic outcomes than we actually\nhave.\nIf I may paraphrase a sainted figure for many of my colleagues, John Maynard Keynes: If\nthe members of the FOMC could manage to get themselves to once again be thought of\nas humble, competent people on the level of dentists, that would be splendid.4 I would\nargue that the time to reassume a more humble central banker persona is upon us.\nThat, Urban, is my take on monetary policy in a nutshell. Now, in the best tradition of\ncentral banking—and dentistry! —I would be happy to avoid answering any questions\nyou or your colleagues might have.\nThank you.\n\n\fNotes\n1\n\nSee Let’s Talk Turkey (About Japanese Turkeys): And Other Tales from the Asian Wall Street Journal,\nUrban C.

        "content": "A U.S. Economic Update and\nPerspective on Monetary Policy\n(With Reference to Leslie W. Fisher)\n\nRemarks before the Australian Business Economists\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSydney, Australia\nNovember 4, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fA U.S. Economic Update and Perspective on Monetary Policy\n(With Reference to Leslie W. Fisher)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Stephen [Halmarick].\nI am thrilled to be back in Sydney. Earlier this morning, I visited Reserve Bank Governor\nStevens and his staff and provided a read on the U.S. economy and monetary policy as of last\nweek’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nI thought I would do the same for you this afternoon. I would then be happy, in the best tradition\nof central banking, to avoid answering any questions you have.\nTo Begin, a Biographical Note\nAs was mentioned by Stephen, I am indeed half Aussie. My father, Leslie Fisher, was a\nQueenslander. In 1910, at the age of five years and two months, he was arrested for begging on\nthe streets in Maryborough and sentenced in the court there to seven years in the Westbrook\nReformatory. 1\nAccording to an article earlier this year in Toowoomba’s daily, The Chronicle, Westbrook was\n“the most feared reformatory in Australia.” The guards there meted out “vicious beatings.” 2\nThankfully, my father’s sentence was commuted after one month; “the little boy … is of tender\nyears and not a fit subject,” wrote the Police Magistrate. My father was released to an orphanage,\nthen shuttled among a series of harsh foster homes before making his way back to the streets and\na remarkable career that took him from Toowoomba to Brisbane to South Africa, Mexico, China,\nand the United States and, ultimately, to … the great republic of Texas!\nMy dad lived to the ripe old age of 90. He was a tough old bird. And Aussie to the bone. For\nmost of his life, he smoked three packs of cigarettes a day and drank a great deal of Scotch. He\nadmitted to this one evening and a friend said, “Hold on. My father was a smoker and also drank\na lot of Scotch. But he died at 60. What gives?” To which my father replied, “Well, he just didn’t\ndo it long enough.” 3\nThe Westbrook prison is no more; indeed, the property on which it stood was sold in May of this\nyear. But the courthouse in Maryborough where my father was sentenced still stands. On\nWednesday, I will visit it to remind myself of where I come from. And to thank my lucky stars\nthat I am the son of a gutsy Australian who managed in one generation to secure his family’s rise\nfrom homeless to Harvard, from begging for food to riches, from being a ward of the state to\nbecoming a principal in the policymaking of the most important central bank in the world.\n\n1\n\n\fSo Stephen, when I say “I am thrilled” to be here, I mean it. I thank you for having me, the son\nof the humblest of Queenslanders, address such a distinguished audience here in Sydney.\nThe Fed in Context\nAustralia was in the grips of a great economic contraction when my father roamed the streets of\nMaryborough. The economic depression here reverberated from a lengthy economic downturn in\nthe United States that crystalized in the Panic of 1907—the so-called “Rich Man’s Panic”\nbeginning in May of that year. It saw the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Co., the third-largest\nbank in New York, and many other banks of deposit in the U.S. as well as then notable financial\ninstitutions in places as far away as Egypt, Japan, Hamburg, Chile and here, Down Under. 4\nEarly in 1907, Jacob Schiff of Kuhn Loeb & Co. gave a speech to the New York Chamber of\nCommerce. He warned that “unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit\nresources, [the United States] will undergo the most severe and far-reaching money panic in\nhistory.” 5 His words were prescient.\nAt the time, we did not have a central bank in the United States; we had not had one for over\nseven decades. The United States had two central banks before 1907: the First Bank of the\nUnited States lasted 20 years before its charter expired in 1811 and was not renewed by\nCongress; the Second Bank of the United States also lasted 20 years before being closed by\nPresident Andrew Jackson in 1836.\nIn 1907, the American financial system was, for all practical purposes, under the control of a\nhandful of financiers. Foremost among them was J.P. Morgan. Mr. Morgan was capable of\nmaneuvering through the ups and downs of an economy and financial system without a central\nbank and become ever richer. The majority of American businesses and bankers could not and\nwere waylaid by recession and financial panic. For all practical purposes, J.P. Morgan was the\nclosest thing to a lender of last resort but was a profiteer, and thus a very poor substitute for a\ncentral bank that Jacob Schiff so rightly said we needed.\nThe Panic of 1907 led to the creation by Congress of the National Monetary Commission and, to\nmake a long story short, that commission, led by Sen. Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island, laid the\ngroundwork for President Woodrow Wilson and the Congress to create the Federal Reserve\nSystem in 1913 and establish the system’s 12 Federal Reserve Banks in 1914.\nThe Fed is uniquely American in structure. It is disaggregated, with the working business of the\ncentral bank distributed across the land through 12 Federal Reserve districts. For example, the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso, conduct\nthe Fed’s business and represent the perspectives of 27 million people and almost $1.5 trillion in\nannual output from Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico—roughly the\nequivalent of the population and output of Australia.\n2\n\n\fThe president of the United States appoints and the U.S. Senate confirms the chairman and the\nsix other governors of the Fed who reside in Washington. The presidents who operate the\nbusiness of our central bank through the dozen Federal Reserve Banks spread across the nation\nare not federal employees. They work under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board, but\nserve at the pleasure of and answer to their own boards of directors that consist of nine private\ncitizens from their individual Reserve Bank districts. The 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents\nrepresent the heartland of the country, “Main Street” as we say in the States. Unlike the Federal\nReserve governors, we do not suffer in having to live in the politically charged atmosphere of\nWashington, D.C.; we operate banker’s banks rather than maneuvering around the lobbyists and\nrent seekers that leech off the political center of our nation.\nTo make monetary policy, all 19 of these principals—the seven governors and the 12 Federal\nReserve Bank presidents—convene every six weeks as the FOMC under the leadership of the\nprimus inter pares, the Federal Reserve Chairman.\nThe mandate of the FOMC is to preserve price and financial stability while conducting monetary\npolicy so as to engender full employment. Think of the Federal Reserve this way: President\nWilson and the Congress of the United States formed a central bank to mitigate the risks of\nAmericans suffering through the economically desperate conditions my father experienced as a\nchild. Like my dad, the Fed has made mistakes and has far from a spotless record. Its role in the\nGreat Depression of the 1930s, the Great Inflation of the 1970s and the run-up to the financial\npanic and ensuing deep recession of 2007–09 come to mind. But over the course of its hundredyear lifetime, the Fed has successfully anchored America’s prosperity.\nCurrent Policy\nWhat about now? Are we doing the job we are supposed to do?\nAs you might imagine, given my roots as a half-Aussie and my being a full-blown Texan, and\ngiven that, as mentioned, the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents are not beholden to the\npresident or Senate of the United States and fear no personal political retribution, I pull no\npunches when I discuss the U.S. economy and our monetary policy. The views I express today\nare my own and mine only.\nI say that the economy of the United States is hog-tied by a government that is sadly ineffective\nand, in fact, counterproductive. We have a government that hasn’t been able to agree on a budget\nin five years; that has historically, under both Republican and Democrat presidents and\nCongresses, spent money and committed itself to fund long-term programs without devising\nrevenue streams to cover current costs or fund future liabilities. It is a government that is more\neffective at forming commissions to discuss what they might do—the president and Congress\njust recently have agreed to their ninth such commission in three years—than in getting anything\n3\n\n\fdone to provide businesses, employers, workers and the citizenry the certainty they need to\nconfidently plan their futures.\nUnder these circumstances, it is no small wonder American businesses are not expanding and\ngrowing jobs at the pace we at the Fed would like to see. It is no small wonder that our economy\nis growing at a substandard pace compared to previous recoveries. It is no small wonder that the\nmost expansive monetary policy the FOMC has ever engineered has been hampered from\naccomplishing what it set out to do. In short, while the Fed has been moving at the speed of a\nboomer in full run, the federal government of the United States has at best exhibited the adaptive\nalacrity of a koala (without being anywhere near as cute).6\nI illustrate this point with some simple math from the most elementary formula for calculating\ngross domestic product (GDP). Private expenditures on goods and services increased at a 3.2\npercent rate over the expansion to date, whereas GDP has increased at 2.2 percent. One could say\nthat GDP would have risen at 3.2 percent had government expenditure increased at the same rate\nas private expenditure. Or, more modestly, if government spending had just been held constant,\ninstead of contracting, GDP would have grown at an annual rate of 2.6 percent.\nI am not a proponent of ever-increasing government spending. Indeed, for many years I have\nbeen an outspoken critic of the federal government’s fiscal misfeasance. I mention this simply to\nillustrate a point: Unlike in most recoveries, government has played a countercyclical,\nsuppressive role. The inability of our government to get its act together has countered the\nprocyclical policy of the Federal Reserve.\nLet me expand on this and describe, from my personal perspective, the pros and cons and\ncost/benefit analysis we must now consider as we contemplate future monetary policy.\n(The remaining remarks will be delivered from the podium).\n\nNOTES\n1\n\nThe records of these events are not available on the web and are, in part, handwritten in Queensland’s\nofficial records, which are not available publicly.

Fisher\nThank you Bill [Dudley]. It is a pleasure to be introduced by my colleague from the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York. Bill is a friend as well as a colleague. Though it is our custom at the\nFederal Reserve to only speak for ourselves and never for any other member of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC), I think I can safely say that all 11 of Bill’s fellow Federal Reserve\nBank presidents and, indeed, all the governors at the Federal Reserve Board, are grateful for\nBill’s skillful leadership and total devotion to our collective mission. He is a hopeless golfer but\na great human being. I want to take this opportunity to formally thank him for his service to the\nFed and to our country.\nRobert Roosa and Wild Dreams\nIt is a very special honor for me to speak at the Economic Club of New York. My very first job\nafter graduating from Stanford Business School was at Brown Brothers Harriman and Co. as the\npolicy assistant to Robert Roosa. Bob Roosa was the proud chairman of the Economic Club from\n1970 to 1971. He used to regale me with its history, of how anybody who was of consequence\nhad spoken here, from Presidents Wilson and Eisenhower and Kennedy to Winston Churchill\nand Indira Gandhi and Zhu Rongji (and many others since).\nI mentioned this to my wife Nancy before flying up here. Without much humility, I asked her,\n“In your wildest dreams did you ever think that your husband would follow in the footsteps of\nthe world’s great leaders and speak to the Economic Club of New York?” You know what her\nanswer was? “Richard, we have been married for 40 years. You don’t appear in my wildest\ndreams.”\nThe Nightmare of Fiscal Policy\nI came to speak to you this morning not of pleasant dreams but of the nightmare of fiscal\nindecision and political chicanery that emanates from Washington, the risk it poses to the\nreputation of our nation, and the limits it imposes on monetary policy.\nI did not come to speak of whether or not we should or might “taper” our asset purchases at the\nnext meeting of the FOMC. Or of how Janet Yellen will lead the committee when she succeeds\nBen Bernanke. Or how I might vote when I rotate into a voter’s slot on the FOMC next year. I\nwould be happy to avoid answering those and any other questions you might have during the\nQ&A session.\n\n1\n\n\fErrol Flynn and Felix Rohatyn\nThe iconic actor Errol Flynn (who, to the best of my knowledge, was not a member of the\nEconomic Club) is reported to have quipped that his legendary financial problems lay “in\nreconciling my gross habits with my net income.” This is the most concise description I can\nmarshal to explain the problem plaguing our nation’s fiscal authorities. And it has not changed\nwith the 11th-hour temporary agreement reached last night by the leaders of Congress and the\npresident. Kicking the can down the road for a few months will not solve the pathology of fiscal\nmisfeasance that undermines our economy and threatens our future.\nI have no doubt that we will go on indefinitely increasing the debt ceiling, be it in a regular or a\nherky-jerky, just-in-the-nick-of-time pattern. For no president or congressional leader dares risk\nbeing recorded in the history books as having consciously presided over default and the\ndestruction of “the full faith and credit of the United States.” Republican or Democrat, all know\nfull well that your fellow New Yorker, Felix Rohatyn, was spot-on some 37 years ago during\nNew York’s great fiscal crisis when he likened default to “someone stepping into a tepid bath\nand slashing his wrists—you might not feel yourself dying, but that’s what would happen.”1\nBut there is, I believe, a limit of tolerance for our government’s fiscally counterproductive, Errol\nFlynn-like ways. I believe that razor in hand, we are stepping toward Rohatyn’s tepid bath and\nthat the full faith and credit of the United States government is, in fact, at risk.\nHaircuts …\nWe saw an expression of this last Thursday when Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd.\nannounced it would apply an increased “haircut” to its valuation of U.S. Treasury securities held\nas collateral against futures trades, with Treasuries maturing in less than one year receiving a risk\ndiscount of 3 percent. This was printed on Friday in a highlighted box above the fold on the front\npage of the Financial Times. Opposite was a picture of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who the\npaper reported had “signaled Beijing’s increasing concern at an Asian summit” and then\nprovided a kindly no-wonder reminder that “China has about 60 percent of its $3.5 trillion\nforeign currency reserves invested in U.S. assets.”2\nThe FT could easily have substituted Premier Li’s picture with one of the German chancellor or\nthe Japanese or British prime minister or the Mexican president, or any other world leader or\nbusiness operator or simple observer of events, and ascribed to any of them a more explicit but\nsurely pervasively held concern: “What the hell is happening to America?” Has the American\nship of state, as Maureen Dowd wrote yesterday, turned into a “ship of fools”?3\n… and Tipping Points\nMy heart bleeds for my country, for no amount of monetary accommodation, no conceivable\namount of “large-scale asset purchases,” no clever new monetary innovation by the Federal\n\n2\n\n\fReserve can offset the rot that is destroying our fiscal house and the blight it spreads over our\neconomy.\nTo be clear, the Federal Reserve will take all appropriate measures to preserve money market\nfunctioning and stability in periods of acute distress. I view this as an integral part of our formal\ndual mandate. Chaotic money markets threaten both price stability and business activity and\nemployment. However, it is not our job to fix the budget impasse. Any initiatives we might have\nto undertake in the course of our duty as a central bank to prevent serious disruptions of U.S.\ndollar funding markets should not be executed in a way that they might be construed to substitute\nfor fiscal redress. Fundamental, structural imbalances in our economy might be temporarily\nobscured but cannot be permanently resolved by monetary sleight of hand.\nIndeed, I argue that the current monetary accommodation policy of purchasing $85 billion a\nmonth in Treasuries and MBS (mortgage-backed securities) risks exacerbating the situation:\nThere is a tipping point where monetary accommodation comes to be viewed not as a pleasant\nstimulus that levitates bond and stock and housing markets leading to a felicitous “wealth\neffect,” but instead as an agent of financial recklessness. None of us really know where that\ntipping point is. But with each dollar of Treasury and MBS purchases the FOMC instructs the\nNew York desk to make, we inch closer to it.\nFor the remainder of Ben Bernanke’s leadership and from the very first moment of his\nsuccessor’s, the FOMC will have to astutely maneuver so as to avoid crossing a line that no\nNobel laureate or econometric modeler or quant-jock or dealer or market operator can identify\nex-ante.\nI admit to a preoccupation with this concern. This much I know: As long as inflationary\nexpectations are held at bay, we can fully open the monetary throttle in an effort to deliver on the\nmandate Congress gave us to help achieve full employment. But it is for naught as long as the\nfiscal authorities are slamming on the brakes and leaving everyone in the dark as to how they\nwill cure the fiscal mess they have wrought.\nNo rational businesswoman or man will or should make a long-term commitment to expanding\ntheir workforce or commit their precious capital to significant job-creating projects if they have\nno idea what their taxes will be or how government spending will impact them or their customers\nor suppliers. And no manager can plan or budget forward while simultaneously working under\nthe yoke of ever-expanding regulations that render incalculable their cost structure, including the\nfull-in cost of the most important variable in that cost structure—the workforce—as long as the\nAffordable Care Act remains more of a mystery than a clear, understandable program.\nThe creative capacity of American business for dealing with uncertainty is unparalleled. But\ndoubts caused by fiscal malfunctioning so extreme that the “risk-free rate” of the world’s largest\n3\n\n\feconomy and reserve currency is called into question are of a different kind and character than\nthe everyday uncertainties that even the most gifted manager is trained to handle. How does one\ndiscount the value of payables and receivables for next year when the world wonders if the U.S.\ngovernment will validate the full value of Treasury bills?\nThe Fed to the Rescue?\nIt is true that unlike the Congress, the FOMC actually makes decisions and does so in a civil\nmanner—both lost traits in Washington. But it is a myth that we have the power on our own to\npropel our economy forward. We can provide the fuel, but we can’t engage the gears of the\nengine of employment. Only businesses can do that. And businesses cannot do it when they\nhaven’t an inkling of how the fiscal mess that is Washington will be resolved. The simple\nobservation is that U.S. businesses and households need confidence that fiscal policy will be\nconducted responsibly—that revenues and expenditures will come into line, over time. Until that\nfog is lifted, do not expect the economy to steam forward at anything but a most cautious pace.\nAnnus Horribilis or …\nIn contemplating the fix we are in, I thought of a phrase used by Queen Elizabeth in her 1992\nspeech, marking the 40th anniversary of her accession to the throne. You may recall that was a\nyear when a series of tragedies, including the burning of Windsor Castle, beset her family. With\nclassic British understatement, she told her subjects: “1992 is not a year on which I shall look\nback with undiluted pleasure. … it has turned out to be an ‘Annus Horribilis’”—a “horrible\nyear.”4\nWe have suffered much on the financial and economic front these past many years. And, in fact,\nsince 1976 we have on 17 occasions under six of the last seven U.S. presidents experienced a\nfederal government disruption, including shutdowns. Since 2010, we have had eight budget\nconventions, to no avail. And we’ve seen several face-offs on the debt ceiling. But the\ncumulative effect of our government’s fiscal ineptitude and propensity to put off taking action on\nhard decisions, and the frustration I feel about the inability of even the most radical monetary\npolicy to work in the absence of long-term fiscal probity, has tempted me to record 2013 as an\nannus horribilis. It is certainly not shaping up to be a year on which I shall look back with\nundiluted pleasure.\nSound but Disagreeable\nIt need not be so horrible, however. In fact, it may be a year of good fortune if our president and\ncongressional leaders summon the courage to put partisan gamesmanship aside and finally craft\ntax and spending and regulatory policy that encourages businesses to take the cheap and\nabundant money the Fed has made possible—the cheapest in the 237-year history of the\nRepublic!—and put it to use creating jobs and expanding the wealth of the entire nation, not just\nthat of rich and quick financiers and those with the means to speculate and profit from volatility.\n\n4\n\n\fGetting these incentives right is not an easy task. But it is crucial.\nOne of the most exalted of the Economic Club’s long history of speakers, Winston Churchill,\nsaid, “In finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is\ndisagreeable.” Continuing down the path of hypermonetary accommodation is certainly\nagreeable, especially if you are invested in stocks or bonds or have been able to refinance your\nmortgage and participate in the new housing boom. But carried on for too long, it is surely an\nunsound way to put our nation back on the path to respectability or eliminate the markets’\nplacing haircuts on the value of U.S. Treasuries.\nThe only way for us to achieve sound footing is for our fiscal leaders to make politically\ndisagreeable decisions. There is no other way for us to regain and maintain our standing as the\nmost prosperous and powerful economy in the history of the world.\nAnnus Mirabilis?\nI mentioned Queen Elizabeth’s annus horribilis. So as to not leave you despondent, I wish to\nremind you that the queen’s expression was a play on words in a poem written in 1667 by John\nDryden, titled Annus Mirabilis—or Year of Miracles.\nDryden was writing about the year that spanned 1665 and 1666. It began with the Great Plague\nof London—a pandemic akin to the bubonic plague—and ended with the Great Fire that burned\nLondon for five days.\nSo why the title Year of Miracles? Because from the wreckage, London rebuilt itself and arose\nfrom the ashes, with wide streets and buildings commissioned by Charles II and designed by\nChristopher Wren that were so solidly constructed they last to this day. Our collective task is to\nturn the current annus horribilis into an opportunity to emerge from the current fiscal wreckage\nstronger and more resilient than ever. If England could do it in the 17th century, we Americans,\nwho have never, ever flinched from staring down and overcoming adversity, can certainly do it\nnow.\nI am tempted to remind you of how Texas arose from the ashes of the 1980s oil bust and savingsand-loan crisis to lead the nation in job creation for several decades and become one of our most\nprosperous states. But I am not going to do so.\nI was going to tell you how in the Texas renaissance, as the U.S. has seen job destruction in the\ntwo middle-income quartiles for the past decade, Texas has seen job creation in those same\nmiddle-income groups and has outperformed the nation in creating jobs in the highest-income\nquartile, too. But I won’t.\n\n5\n\n\fI am tempted to tell you that Texas came off the bottom to become the top exporting state in the\nUnited States. But I shan’t. Or that state laws and regulations crafted with the 1980s banking\ncrisis in mind spared Texas the worst of the recent housing crisis.\nAll these factors, of which I won’t breathe a word, have resulted in a workforce of some 12.8\nmillion and, in 2006, catapulted the state to its ranking as the top destination for people who\nmove across states. Americans and immigrants alike come to Texas to seek jobs and opportunity\nin what continues to be the nation’s most dynamic economy. I could tell you about that, but I will\nrefrain from Texas brag.\nNew York, New York\nInstead, let me point to New York as an example of what is possible.\nSome of you may remember the predicament in which New York found itself in 1975, the year I\ncame to work at Brown Brothers. It was de facto bankrupt. Garbage piled up on the streets.\nCrime was rampant. Upper East Side apartments could be had simply for the assumption of\nmaintenance costs. Nothing worked. Everything was dysfunctional. The outlook was so horrific\nthat Mick Jagger wrote “Shattered” after a cab ride around the city. Remember the lyrics? “What\na mess, this town’s in tatters/I’ve been shattered, my brain’s been battered/Splattered all over\nManhattan …”\nThen, when the markets showed the city the back of its hand, leaders such as Felix Rohatyn and\nGov. [Hugh] Carey and others stepped up to the plate. They and the people of New York turned\nsomething truly horribilis into a thing mirabilis. Disagreeable but sound decisions were made.\nThose decisions took a tattered, shattered city and put it on the path to becoming the bright,\nshiny, miraculous Big Apple that it is today.\nA Plea\nThe Federal Reserve is limited in its power to make what took place in New York happen for our\nnation, and unless the fiscal authorities get their act together, looking to the Fed to solve the\nnation’s economic ills through ever-expansive monetary policy might well make the situation\nworse. So I end with a plea for our president and our Congress. The markets are restless. Your\npeers around the world are afraid. There is little remaining tolerance for agreeable but unsound\ndecisions. The bond market is beginning to show us the back of its hand. It is time for leadership.\nTurning something horrible into something miraculous is the American thing to do. Please get on\nwith it.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\nAs quoted in “Infamous ‘Drop Dead’ Was Never Said by Ford,” by Sam Roberts, New York Times, Dec. 28, 2006.\n\n6\n\n\f2\n\n“Asia Moves to Protect Itself, Just in Case,” by Jeremy Grant and Paul J.

Fisher en la ocasion del lanzamiento del nuevo billete de\n$100\n8 de octubre 2013 Houston\nMuchas gracias por venir. Hoy es un día muy importante en la historia de nuestra moneda.\nEstamos aquí hoy para anunciar la puesta en circulación del nuevo y mejorado billete de 100\ndólares, siendo este la pieza más sofisticada de moneda que se haya producido hasta la\nfecha en los Estados Unidos.\nEl billete de 100 dólares es el billete americano de mayor circulación a nivel mundial y\ntambién el más falsificado en todo el mundo, por eso esta nueva nota incorpora nueva\ntecnología para combatir la falsificación.\nSe estima que casi dos tercios de los billetes de 100 dólares circulan fuera de los Estados\nUnidos. Por eso es importante para nuestra nación prevenir la falsificación de la moneda y\nmantener su integridad.\nA partir de hoy - cualquier banco comercial, caja de ahorro o unión de crédito que ordene\nbilletes de 100 dólares de la Reserva Federal recibirá este nuevo diseño. El público lo tendrá\nen sus manos en cuestión de días.\nComo ustedes ya saben, los billetes de los Estados Unidos son impresos en el Bureau of\nEngraving and Printing el cual forma parte del Departamento del Tesoro. El BEP (por sus\nsiglas en inglés) entrega los billetes a los doce bancos de la Reserva Federal, a quienes les\ncorresponde ponerlos en circulación a través de las instituciones financieras. A nosotros en la\nReserva Federal nos gusta señalar que todos los billetes en circulación son técnicamente\nnotas de la Reserva Federal.\nTodos los dólares estadounidenses son impresos por el BEP en dos sitios: Washington, DC, y\nFort Worth, Texas. Estos son los dos únicos lugares en el mundo donde se imprime,\nlegalmente, la moneda de los Estados Unidos.\nEstamos especialmente orgullosos del nuevo billete de 100 dólares, ya que la gran mayoría\nde ellos han sido impresos en Fort Worth. Cuando usted reciba uno, fíjese que hay una\npequeña \"FW\" en la parte delantera, indicando que ese billete tiene su origen en las\ninstalaciones de Fort Worth.\n¡Así que en este gran estado de Texas - con su economía fuerte- hacemos dinero, pero\ntambién el dinero se hace!\n\n\fA lo mejor quieren saber ¿qué tiene de especial este billete, además de sus raíces en Texas?\nContiene varias medidas de seguridad contra la falsificación, pero el público pronto se dará\ncuenta de dos cosas en particular.\nEn primer lugar, en la parte frontal del billete, ustedes encontrarán una cinta azul de\nseguridad 3-D (tercera dimensión). Esta cinta está tejida en el papel, no impresa en él.\nAdemás, la cinta de seguridad tiene imágenes de la Campana de la Libertad y el número 100.\nSi mueven el billete hacia adelante y hacia atrás, las campanas se transforman en el número\ncien y se mueven de un lado a otro. Si mueven el billete de un lado a otro, las campanitas y el\nnúmero cien se mueven de arriba a abajo.\nLa segunda medida de seguridad que ustedes notarán en el frente del billete será una\ncampana dentro de un tintero. Tanto la campana como el tintero son de color cobre. Sin\nembargo, cuando se inclina el billete, la campana cambia de color cobre a color verde.\nEl nuevo billete conserva la marca de agua del retrato de Benjamin Franklin, visible cuando\nse pone el billete contra la luz.\nEstas medidas de seguridad se incorporan para disuadir la falsificación de nuestra moneda y,\nprevenir, por lo tanto, las grandes pérdidas que ese delito podría ocasionar a consumidores y\nempresarios. Verificar la autenticidad del nuevo billete de 100 dólares solo toma unos\nsegundos.\nEn pocas palabras – el nuevo billete es difícil de falsificar pero sobre todo su autenticidad es\nfácil comprobar.\nRecuerden, si ustedes reciben un billete falso - de cualquier denominación - no lo podrá\ncambiar por un billete auténtico. Así que es importante saber cómo distinguir los billetes\nbuenos de los falsos.\nEsta plática podría dar la impresión de que la falsificación de dólares es muy común pero no\nes así. Muy pocos billetes se reportan como falsos en los Estados Unidos.\nEste nuevo billete de 100 dólares sirve para asegurar que los Estados Unidos se mantienen a\nla vanguardia de la tecnología contra la falsificación en todo el mundo.\nEs importante que el público sepa que no es necesario cambiar sus billetes viejos de 100\ndólares por los nuevos. Todos los diseños de los diferentes billetes en circulación conservan\nsu valor y son aceptados como modo de pago. Los Estados Unidos nunca ha retirado del\nmercado billetes con diseños anteriores y mucho menos devaluado la moneda a raíz de la\nintroducción de nuevos billetes.\nLos billetes con diseños antiguos eventualmente llegan a la Reserva Federal a través de las\ninstituciones bancarias. Una vez en la Reserva Federal, los billetes viejos no aptos para seguir\nen circulación son reciclados, es decir los mandamos al cielo del dinero.\nEste proceso asegura que el dinero que el público recibe de los bancos sea seguro y esté en\nbuenas condiciones.\n\n\fCon esto concluyo mi presentación. Gracias por venir. Nos quedamos aquí varios\nfuncionarios de la Reserva Federal - incluyéndome a mí – a su disposición y encantados de\nresponder a sus preguntas.\nNotes\n\nLas opiniones expresadas por el autor no reflejan necesariamente las posiciones oficiales de\nla Reserva Federal.\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard W.

        "content": "Speech by Richard W. Fisher, President and CEO (2005–2015)\n\nRemarks for $100 Bill Launch\nRichard Fisher's remarks for $100 Bill Launch at Houston Branch\nOctober 8, 2013 Houston\nThank you for coming. This is a significant day in the life of U.S. currency.\nWe are here today to announce that we are putting into general circulation the newly\nredesigned $100 bill — which is the most sophisticated piece of currency the United States\nhas ever produced.\nThe $100 note is the most widely circulated and most often counterfeited U.S. bill around\nthe world, and this new note incorporates advanced technology to combat counterfeiting.\nWe estimate that nearly two-thirds of $100 bills circulate outside the U.S. That is why it’s\nimportant for our nation to stay ahead of counterfeiting and maintain the integrity of our\ncurrency.\nStarting today — any commercial bank, savings and loan, or credit union that orders $100\nnotes from the Federal Reserve will receive this new design. Consumers can expect to find it\nin their hands in a matter of days, depending upon where they bank.\nAs you know, U.S. currency is printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, an arm of the\nTreasury Department. The BEP then ships the bills to the Federal Reserve Banks, which put\nthem into circulation through financial institutions. We at the Federal Reserve like to point\nout that all U.S. bills are technically Federal Reserve Notes.\nAll U.S. currency is printed at the BEP’s plants in Washington, D.C., and Fort Worth, Texas.\nThose are the only two places in the world where U.S. money is printed — legally printed.\nWe are particularly proud of the new $100 note because the vast majority of them have\nbeen printed in Fort Worth. When you receive one, you may notice a small “FW” printed on\nthe front. This, of course, designates the work of the Fort Worth facility.\nSo in this great state — with its strong economy — not only do we make money in Texas, but\nwe make money in Texas.\nSo what’s so special about this bill, besides its Texas roots? There are a good number of anticounterfeiting measures designed into this new issuance, but consumers will quickly notice\ntwo new features.\nFirst, on the front of the note, you’ll find a blue 3-D security ribbon. This ribbon is woven into\nthe paper, not printed on it. The ribbon features images of the Liberty Bell and the numeral\n100.\n\n\fIf you tilt the note back and forth, the bells change to100s as they move side to side. If you\ntilt the note side to side, the bells and 100s move up and down.\nAlso, on the front, there is a bell in an inkwell. This is a color-shifting bell inside a copper\ninkwell. The inkwell and bell are both copper. When you tilt the note back and forth, the bell\nchanges from copper to green.\nThe bill retains the watermark portrait of Benjamin Franklin, visible when you hold the bill up\nto light.\nThese anti-counterfeiting measures are incorporated not only to deter bad guys from\nreplicating our money, but also to help protect consumers and business operators from\nlosses. It only takes a few seconds to check the new $100 bill to make sure it’s real.\nSimply put — these bills are hard to replicate but easy to authenticate.\nRemember, if you receive a counterfeit bill — of any denomination — you cannot turn it in\nfor a genuine note. So it’s important to know what real money looks like.\nAll of this may lead people to believe there is a large-scale counterfeiting problem in the U.S.,\nand that’s not the case. Few U.S. notes are reported counterfeit.\nThis new $100 note is our latest proactive step to ensure America stays ahead of\ncounterfeiting technology around the world.\nIt’s important for consumers to know that it is not necessary to trade in their old $100 bills\nfor new ones. All designs of U.S. currency remain legal tender, regardless of when they were\nissued. The United States has never recalled, de-monetized or de-valued its currency as\nupdated bills were issued.\nAs the older designs make their way through the banking system, they will eventually get\nreturned to the Federal Reserve, where they will be recycled. We think of it as sending the\nold bills to money heaven.\nThis process ensures that the money consumers receive from banks is safe, fit and secure.\nThank you all for coming.\nThis concludes our formal remarks, but we have several officials here from the Federal\nReserve — including myself — who will be happy to answer your questions.\nNotes\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System.\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard W. Fisher served as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from\nApril 2005 until his retirement in March 2015.\n\n\f\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas\nOctober 3, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fUncertainty Matters\n(With Reference to Kinky Monetary Policy, Two Nickels and a Dime)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Evan [Koenig].1\nIt is a pleasure to share this platform with John Taylor. I first met John at a Carnegie Foundation\nseminar when he was Undersecretary of the Treasury; I have been among the legions of his\nadmirers ever since. He is thoughtful, no-nonsense and, importantly, dedicated to making\nmonetary policy work with maximum efficacy. We at the Dallas Fed are grateful that he chairs\nthe advisory board of our Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. And we all, as\nAmericans, are grateful for his service and dedication to our country. Thank you, John, for being\nthe good patriot and man that you are.\nUncertainty Matters\nUncertainty matters. A lot.\nThis won’t be a surprise to many of you. The first thing you are taught in any MBA program, be\nit at Stanford, where I earned my degree, or anywhere else, is that “business” is the process of\nmanaging under conditions of uncertainty. All business executives worth their salt organize their\nteams and resources to minimize uncertainty of factors under their control; and they develop\ncontingencies and operating tactics and strategies for factors over which they have no direct\ncontrol. Obviously, the less-clear external influences are, the greater the degree of angst about\nbudgeting and planning for the future. Even the saltiest of helmsmen cannot confidently navigate\na ship in a dense fog.\nGoing back to the earliest days of the current recovery, my business contacts have regularly\ncomplained of the fog of uncertainty emanating from Washington: They have consistently cited\nfiscal and regulatory uncertainty as major impediments to capital investment and expanding\npayrolls. Given uncertainty about the implications for overhead of the Affordable Care Act and\nother government mandates, they’ve complained of not knowing what their all-in labor and other\ncosts will be and of how that lack of knowledge has made long-term employment planning\nnearly impossible. I’m sure that many of you have heard similar complaints—or have voiced\nthem yourselves.\nWhat you may not realize is that until quite recently, economists who study business cycles and\nmonetary policy paid scant attention to the effects of uncertainty on aggregate job and output\ngrowth. The profession’s standard models assume that the economy is populated with\nhouseholds and firms that are identical to one another, or that people and businesses can insure\naway individual risk and so are effectively, theoretically, identical. It’s become standard practice,\ntoo, to assume that decision-makers are hyper-rational in how they form their expectations of\nfuture policy and future events; they are assumed to fully understand how the economy works.\nTo be sure, the economy is subject to shocks, so that its course is unpredictable. But that\nuncertainty, according to this school of theory, is of no real consequence for households’\n1\n\n\fdecisions about how much to save and consume, or businesses’ decisions about how much to\nhire and invest. The technical term is “certainty equivalence”: In standard models, choices\ndepend on what you expect will happen and not on the degree to which you are confident in your\npredictions.\nSuch thinking is far removed from reality and, thankfully, there’s increasing recognition of that\nfact. A variety of uncertainty indexes have been developed and their importance in theory and in\npractice examined.2 Pretty uniformly, these studies suggest that changes in uncertainty have\nsignificant economic effects and that uncertainty has been elevated in recent years.\nIn theoretical analyses, the impact of uncertainty is especially great when realistic financial and\ninformational frictions prevent risk from being spread optimally. Because of such frictions, for\nexample, debt contracts often require that borrowers post collateral. When uncertainty increases,\nso do collateral requirements, tightening credit and increasing the value of “safe” assets relative\nto other assets.3\nThere’s more than one type of uncertainty. There’s uncertainty about future average tax rates on\ninvestment income, for example, or the future pace of average labor productivity gains. This is\naggregate uncertainty. There is also uncertainty that widens the distribution of asset returns\nacross firms or the distribution of income prospects across households, while leaving aggregate\naverage asset returns and aggregate average productivity prospects unchanged. This is crosssectional uncertainty. Finally, there’s the uncertainty that you feel when you think that you\nunderstand how the world works and then discover that you don’t because something happens\nthat you thought unlikely to happen.4 In the extreme, these are “black swan” events: the “oh spit”\nmoments we experience when we realize that we have fundamentally and disastrously\nmiscalculated.\nBlack swans induce paradigm shifts: The world—or, at least, our thinking about the world—is\nnever the same again. The Great Depression was one such event. The housing-market collapse\nthat began in 2006 and then spilled over to financial markets is another. If the U.S. government\ndefaults on its debt later this month, we’ll have a third example. The unthinkable will have\nbecome real, and the “full faith and credit” of the United States will be a mirage rather than\naccepted fact.\nThere are myriad other events that, on a much smaller scale, lead people to question their\nunderstanding of the rules. For example, the recent decision of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) to maintain the pace of its large-scale asset purchases in the face of a\ngenerally improving labor market outlook and a widespread perception within financial markets,\nright or wrong, that the Fed had telegraphed a dialing back of the rate of purchases may have\nincreased uncertainty about the future path of monetary policy. That was one argument raised\nagainst the decision not to taper. I know, because I made the argument, and I was not alone.\nMost real-world fiscal and regulatory uncertainty is a mix of aggregate and cross-sectional\nuncertainty. Given the aging of the U.S. population, we know that the revenues required to\nfinance entitlement programs will certainly have to increase in coming decades. “Entitlement\nreform” may ameliorate the problem but won’t eliminate it. Government purchases will have to\nbe cut, relative to baseline projections, and tax revenues will certainly have to be increased. But\n2\n\n\fexactly which programs will be cut and which taxes increased, and when, is unclear and has been\nfurther muddled by the behavior of fiscal policy makers these past few days.\nThe financial crisis and subsequent recession exacerbated these problems by increasing the\noutstanding stock of debt. U.S. federal government debt held by the public has increased from 34\npercent of potential GDP at the business-cycle peak in first quarter 2001 (shortly before the 9/11\nattacks) to 36 percent in fourth quarter 2007 (just prior to the Great Recession) to 70 percent of\npotential GDP today.\nThis increased debt has been manageable as a result of a substantial fall in interest rates. Indeed,\ninterest on the public debt has trended downward from 4.7 percent of potential GDP in 1990 to\n3.2 percent in 2007 to just 2.1 percent in 2012 as the average interest rate on Treasury securities\nhas dropped from 9 percent to 5 percent, then to its recent level of 2½ percent. Rates obviously\ncannot continue to fall, though, so the cost of servicing debt is sure to increase, even if the size of\nthe debt relative to the economy stabilizes.\nThe Canary in the Mine: Capital Investment\nCapital investment is the economy’s canary in the mine because it’s often the first thing to\nsuccumb to uncertainty. Also, once undertaken, capital investment is costly to reverse.\nInvestment has certainly been unusually sluggish in the wake of the recent recession. Going back\nto when our data begin, in 1947, net investment as a percent of GDP has fluctuated around a\nconstant mean of 5.6 percent.5 It boomed in the late 1990s, reaching 8.1 percent of GDP, its\nhighest level in over 50 years. The only higher quarter on record was the second quarter of 1950\n(shortly after John Taylor and I came into this world, although I am not implying causality). Its\npeak during the 2001–07 expansion was an unremarkable 6.9 percent, but the subsequent plunge\nwas unprecedented in the post-World War II data: The U.S. capital stock actually shrank during\nthe second half of 2009. Relative to its 5.6 percent long-run average, net investment as a percent\nof GDP fell by twice as far as it had in any prior postwar recession.\nMore to the point, the recovery in investment has been exceptionally anemic. Today, four full\nyears after the trough of the recession in second quarter 2009, net investment as a percent of\nGDP is still only 3.2 percent—a level typical of past recession lows. Net investment as a percent\nof GDP was last at or above its 5.6 percent long-run mean 6½ years ago.\nSmall wonder then that nonfarm payroll employment has been slow to recover too. Through\nAugust we had restored less than 80 percent of the 8.7 million jobs lost during the Great\nRecession. Less well known is the fact that real GDP per capita only recovered its prerecession\npeak this past summer.6 That’s 5½ years to make up the ground lost during the recession.\nPrevious post-WWII recoveries never required more than nine quarters maximum. A Dallas Fed\nanalysis suggests that the recent financial crisis and its aftermath put the U.S. back by more than\nan entire year’s worth of output, an equivalent of more than $120,000 per American household.7\nBaker-Bloom-Davis and Better Comprehending Uncertainty\nAnd what of uncertainty? I mentioned earlier that we now have several uncertainty indexes. One\nof these, focused on measuring policy uncertainty, was developed by our moderator, Nick\nBloom, together with Scott Baker at Stanford and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago.\nThe index is based on three different types of information: (1) a count of articles referencing\n3\n\n\funcertainty, the economy and policy that have appeared in prominent U.S. newspapers\n(including the nation’s premier paper, the Dallas Morning News); (2) a weighted count of taxcode provisions that are scheduled to expire; and (3) the extent to which professional forecasters\ndisagree with one another about future levels of inflation and government purchases.\nThe Baker-Bloom-Davis index begins in January 1985 and runs through the present. High values\nof the index signal an elevated level of economic policy uncertainty. From 1985 through 2007—\nprior to the 2008–09 recession—the index has a mean of 94, and it exceeds 150 only 2 percent of\nthe time (one month in 50; just six times in over 23 years). The index rose to above-average\nlevels in the fall of 2007 and stayed at or above 94—but below 150—through the summer of\n2008. Then, between August and September 2008, the index nearly doubled, rising from 96 to\n188. Since September 2008, the index has at no time dropped below 100, and it has exceeded\n150 on 31 occasions—more than half the time. It has soared above 200 twice: for two months in\n2011, coincident with that year’s debt-ceiling debate, and in December 2012, when a\ncompromise implementation of sequestration was being hammered out. It’ll be interesting to see\nwhat happens with the index in the wake of the past week’s developments (or lack thereof) in\nWashington.\nThe point is that starting with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, economic\npolicy uncertainty has been consistently high, and half the time it has been extraordinarily high.\nIt’s difficult to prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” that this elevated uncertainty is causally\nrelated to the weak recovery we’ve experienced. But the hypothesis is surely sensible, the timing\nis certainly auspicious, and enough careful confirming analysis has been done to say that the\npreponderance of evidence favors the proposition that not just recent policy decisions, but also\nthe manner in which those decisions were arrived at, have been a significant hindrance to\neconomic expansion.\nThe Kinky Stuff: Monetary Policy\nAs to monetary policy, I would submit there are several links between monetary policy and\neconomic uncertainty. First, though, some background.\nOrdinarily, monetary policy works by influencing the current and expected near-term levels of\nshort-term interest rates. Once short-term interest rates hit zero, however, the Fed turned to\nunconventional policies. By using massive purchases of longer-term Treasuries and agency\nmortgage-backed securities, these policies helped hold down term premia and support the\nhousing recovery. Simultaneously, the Fed tried—and I emphasize tried because the message\nseems to have been garbled in the minds of some intended recipients—to influence expectations\nof its own behavior once asset purchases have run their course. These “asset-purchase” and\n“forward-guidance” policies are relatively unfamiliar, and their impact is uncertain.\nOne implication is that aggregate fiscal shocks—and, hence, also aggregate fiscal uncertainties—\nare likely to have outsize effects in current circumstances. Contractionary fiscal policy that\nwould ordinarily drive down interest rates, providing offsetting stimulus to private expenditure,\nwill have a larger-than-typical economic impact because this “crowding in” is absent once\ninterest rates are confined to the zero lower bound. Expansionary fiscal policy, similarly, will fail\nto “crowd out” private expenditure if interest rates hold steady.\n\n4\n\n\fSecond, because the zero bound complicates the conduct of monetary policy and short-circuits\nfiscal crowding out, it introduces a “kink,” or discontinuity, in the economy’s behavior. The\nexistence of a kink means that uncertainty matters even if ordinarily it would not: “Certainty\nequivalence” no longer applies. When real growth and/or inflation prospects are weak—so that\nthe economy is operating near the zero bound—downside risks to growth and inflation loom\nlarger than they ordinarily would. More-aggressive-than-usual policy responses may be\nappropriate to avoid the negative implications of an encounter with the zero bound.\nParadoxically, though, once the lower bound on interest rates is binding, a less-than-usuallyaggressive monetary policy response may be appropriate. I have tried to articulate this in FOMC\nmeetings ever since we started down the path of quantitative easing, drawing on anecdotal\nreports from my CEO contacts and what I thought was common sense. But my arguments fell on\ndeaf ears until my more learned counterpart at the San Francisco Fed, John Williams, produced a\nformal study that posited that the aggressive use of unfamiliar policy tools like quantitative\neasing and Operation Twist add to aggregate economic uncertainty and, if applied at all, should\nbe deployed more cautiously than our more familiar tools.8\nLarge Margins of Error\nIn general, the objective of monetary policy is to provide households and firms with an economic\nenvironment that makes it attractive to use money as medium of exchange and store of value.\nSince many private contracts, including labor and debt contracts as well as capital expenditure\ncommitments, extend out several years, a multiyear policy perspective is needed. A multiyear\nperspective is especially important when the economy may encounter the zero bound. The\nexplanation is that by interfering with the normal conduct of monetary policy, the zero bound\nincreases the likelihood that policy will miss its objectives year after year in the same direction,\nso that the errors accumulate over time.\nOver the past five years, for example, PCE inflation has averaged 1.2 percent per year. The\nFOMC’s announced long-term inflation objective is 2.0 percent. Over a single year, the\ndifference between 1.2 percent and 2.0 percent inflation is inconsequential. Over five years,\nthough, that small difference cumulates to a 4.26 percentage point difference in the price level,\nwhich is not insignificant, perhaps, if back in 2008 you took out a mortgage with a five-year\nballoon. Alternatively, nominal GDP growth over the past five years has averaged 2.4 percent\nper year, when ordinarily one might have expected 4.5 percent average annual growth (2.5\npercent real growth plus 2.0 percent inflation). Again, the difference is inconsequential in any\ngiven year. Accumulated over five years, though, the level of nominal income today is fully 12\npercent below what might reasonably have been expected when mortgage and auto loan\nagreements were made back in 2008.\nKindly note that I am not advocating any change to the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target. My\npoint is simply to highlight the longer-term consequences of what might appear to be smallish,\nshorter-term deviations from the norm. Business operators plan capital expenditure and payrolls\nnot in one- or two- or even three-year increments; they plan and budget over longer-term\nhorizons. The nominal stability that people need if they are going to negotiate multiyear\ncontracts is a multiyear nominal stability. A policy that “lets bygones be bygones” from year to\nyear may not achieve this kind of stability, especially when policy options can become\nconstrained, in the short term, by the zero bound. A policy that takes a longer-term perspective\nand is properly communicated and executed—so as to instill confidence that monetary policy\n5\n\n\fwill hew to a 2 percent inflation target rather than fixate on the run-rate of the past four quarters\nor the outlook for the next four—may better supply the longer-term comfort that households and\nbusinesses need to plan and budget. Such a policy would reduce the uncertainty that monetary\npolicy as it is currently conducted spawns and would be more effective in doing its part to assist\nin economic expansion.9\nA Dime Between Two Nickels\nI hope this is enough to get a conversation started. I will now turn the microphone over to John\nTaylor. In doing so, I am reminded of Ross Perot’s quip when he was placed between Bill\nClinton and George H.W. Bush for a predebate photograph in the 1992 presidential election.\nNoting that Mr. Perot was substantially shorter than the other two men, a reporter asked him how\nhe felt. His reply: “I feel like a dime between two nickels.” In contrast, compared to John Taylor,\nI feel like an intellectual dwarf—a mere penny sitting on the dais next to John’s $100 bill brain.\nAnd I’m talking about the new, difficult to replicate $100 bill that will be released next Tuesday.\nPlease join me in welcoming John Taylor to the podium.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nThe speaker is indebted to Dallas Fed Senior Vice President and Principal Policy Advisor Evan Koenig for his\ninput in developing the themes articulated in this speech.\n2\nUncertainty indexes are described and analyzed in the following recent papers: “Measuring Economic Policy\nUncertainty,” by Scott R.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSan Antonio\nSeptember 23, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fReview, Reflect and Deflect\n(With Reference to the Texas Ratio, ‘Super-Spreaders’\nand Three Great Newspapers)\nRichard W. Fisher\n\nThank you, Chris [Williston]. I am honored and delighted to speak to you all today. I understand\nthat Danny King’s daughter, Amy, arranged quite a songwriters’ show for you last night. I heard\nit was so good that Ann Worthy, my head regulator at the Dallas Fed, stayed up past midnight ...\nfor the first time in 40 years.\nI am going to start today by reviewing current banking trends for the nation and for the Eleventh\nFederal Reserve District.\nThen, as there has been a great deal of reflection in the press and blogosphere on the occasion of\nthe fifth anniversary of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy and the ensuing global financial crisis, I\nwant to briefly provide you an overview of what the crisis cost us as a nation and the work\nremaining to prevent a reoccurrence of a crisis, a subject I will be addressing in a more fulsome\nmanner in a speech and a public debate in New York in mid-October.\nLast, I will comment briefly on last week’s FOMC meeting and what some have referred to as\n“the taper caper,” doing my utmost to deflect your criticism.\nTexas’ Superior Bank Performance\nFirst, let’s discuss how banks in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District are performing in the\ncontext of national trends. Recall that the district includes some 27 million people sprawled\nacross approximately 360,000 square miles in southern New Mexico, Texas and the wooded\nnorth of Louisiana. Over 96 percent of the economic output and the district’s banking assets are\nin Texas, so you might reasonably say I am speaking of the performance of Texas banks versus\nbanks in the U.S. as a whole.\n\n1\n\n\fNational Trends\n\n• Profitability continues to improve\n• Provision expense has fallen below precrisis\nlevels\n• Asset quality problems continue to moderate\n• Bank lending activity continues to rebound\n\nProfitability is fairly strong across the nation, helped in part by a continued decline in provision\nexpense. Asset quality continues to improve, and lending activity continues to grow nationally.\nThese national trends are consistent with what we have seen over the last several quarters.\nYou should take pride in knowing that Eleventh District and Texas banks are outperforming the\nrest of the nation’s banks.\nLet’s look at comparative return on assets (ROA):\n\n2\n\n\fReturn on Assets\n\n*Data are through June 30, annualized.\n\nProfitability trends over the last several years as measured by ROA show that district banks\ncontinue to outperform banks nationwide, with an ROA of 1.15 percent versus 1.12 percent for\nall U.S. banks.\nWhile moving in the right direction, banks still have a little more work to do before their\nprofitability reaches precrisis levels.\nProvision expense is worth noting:\n\n3\n\n\fProvision Expense\n\n*Data are through June 30, annualized.\n\nFalling provision expense has contributed to improved earnings trends for both U.S. and district\nbanks. Declines in the amount banks set aside to cover bad loans have importantly contributed to\nimproved profitability over the last several years. This, however, is not likely to be the case\nmoving forward.\nBanks nationwide and in the district are now reporting provisions below precrisis levels. In the\ncase of our district banks, provision expense as a percentage of average assets is almost half of\nwhat was reported in 2006.\nIt doesn’t look like profitability is going to be bolstered much by net interest margin (NIM),\neither.\n\n4\n\n\fNet Interest Margin\n\n*Data are through June 30, annualized.\n\nThe NIM for banks across the U.S. has continued to trend lower over the past two decades; in the\ndistrict, the trend has been observed over the past decade. It is noteworthy that the most recent\ndecline in NIM is certainly affected by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates.1\nAs you can see in this chart, district banks continue to report a slightly higher margin at 3.33\npercent versus 3.25 percent for banks nationwide.\nNow let’s look at how profitability differs nationally by bank asset size:\n\n5\n\n\fReturn on Assets by Asset Size\nU.S. Banks\n\n*Data are through June 30, annualized.\nNOTE: Asset size group is based on organization-level assets.\n\nROA has considerably improved in all size classes—banks with asset sizes of less than $10\nbillion and between $10 billion and $250 billion, and the largest banks, those with assets greater\nthan $250 billion.\nThe upward trend in ROA tapers off by 2013 for community and midsize banks, while\nprofitability for the dozen or so big banks—the cohort that includes banks considered “too big to\nfail” (TBTF)—shoots up rather dramatically. The Big Guys earned a ROA of 1.26 percent versus\n1.04 percent for the community banks.\nThis chart shows the major profitability components for the asset size classes we just discussed:\n\n6\n\n\fProfitability by Asset Size\nU.S. Banks — June 30, 2013\n\nNOTE: Asset size group is based on organization-level assets.\n\nStarting from the bottom up, you can see that the ROA for the biggest banks is 22 basis points\nabove that for community banks. Recall that Eleventh District banks earned 1.15 percent ROA;\nthus, the Big Guys outpace even the relatively stronger performance of our healthy banks in and\naround Texas.\nThis gap is being driven by a couple of things: The largest banks have lower noninterest expense;\nsome would say this is due to economies of scale. These Big Guys also recorded much higher\nnoninterest income—a full 100 basis points higher. These two items were more than enough to\noffset the lower net interest income reported by the biggest banks.\nHaving noted that big gap, let’s focus on the noninterest-income component for a minute and\nlook at how it has impacted earnings trends for the Big Guys.\n\n7\n\n\fNoninterest Income by Asset Size\nU.S. Banks\n\n*Data are through June 30, annualized.\n**Includes items such as ATM fees and interchange fees that are not reported by all banks.\nNOTE: Asset size group is based on organization-level assets.\n\nThis chart shows noninterest income and its components for each of the three size classes of\nbanks for 2012 and 2013.2 As you can see, noninterest income was virtually unchanged for the\ncommunity and midsize banks, while noninterest income has increased for the largest banks,\nfrom 1.89 percent of average assets in 2012 to 2.09 percent in 2013. Looking at the components\nof noninterest income, you can see that the growth has been driven by an increase in trading\nrevenue.\nTrading revenue is a noncore/nontraditional income source that is typically not available to\ncommunity and the smaller midsize banks. It is thus more difficult for these smaller institutions\nto return to their historical norms or even compete in traditional lending with the Big Guys,\nwhose lending activities, in a sense, are subsidized by their trading activities. We are receiving\nnumerous reports from community and regional banks in the Eleventh District that the lending\nterms and standards of big banks are becoming increasingly lax.\nAs you know, a common measure of asset quality is the noncurrent loan ratio, the percentage of\na bank’s loans 90 or more days past due or on nonaccrual status. Here’s a comparison of\nnoncurrent loans for U.S. versus district banks:\n\n8\n\n\fNoncurrent Loans by Loan Type\n(Percent of loans)\n\nWells FargoSouth Central\neffect\n\n*Data are as of June 30.\nNOTE: Wells Fargo-South Central added a charter in Houston in 2009,\nmoving a large volume of mortgage loans into the district.\n\nWe’ve seen fairly dramatic improvement in asset quality over the last several years, with the\nnoncurrent ratio declining to 3.07 percent for banks nationwide and 1.55 percent for those in the\ndistrict. You can see from this chart that banks in Texas and the district continue to outperform\nbanks nationwide.\nMost of you remember the legendary Bob Hankins, who retired last year after 20 years as head\nof Banking Supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Bob received an award last year\nat this very luncheon. He had a saying that Texas banks were “twice as good and half as bad” as\nbanks nationwide. That remains the case, though banks around the U.S. are slowly catching up\nwith Texas, and you can also see from the chart that banks here and in the U.S. still have some\nwork to do to get noncurrent loans down to precrisis levels.\nHow about the so-called Texas ratio—a measure of noncurrent loans plus other real estate owned\nexpressed as a percentage of equity plus loan loss reserves?3 This became a scarlet letter in the\nlate 1980s when 20 percent of Texas banks had a Texas ratio exceeding 100 percent. However,\nin 2013 only 0.7 percent of Texas banks had a Texas ratio greater than 100 percent, compared\nwith 2.5 percent nationwide—and that nationwide number is down from a 5.7 percent peak in\nfourth quarter 2010.\nNote what is labeled on the center right side of the chart as the “Wells Fargo-South Central\neffect.” Wells Fargo relocated a charter to Houston in 2009 and moved a large volume of\nmortgage loans into the district, triggering the increase in nonperforming residential real estate.\n(If the Wells Fargo-South Central effect is excluded from the 2009 data, the noncurrent loan ratio\nfalls by 71 basis points for the district.)\nNow here is something I consider particularly noteworthy about our district: our loan growth and\nits composition.\n9\n\n\fLoan Growth\n\nNOTE: Data for Eleventh District banks have been adjusted to ensure consistent comparisons over time.\n\nLoan growth on a year-over-year basis remains good, but it decelerated a bit for the nation in the\nsecond quarter to 3.74 percent. In contrast, loan growth for district banks ticked up slightly to\n5.72 percent, almost 200 basis points above the nationwide average.\nOf interest, you can see from this multiyear chart that loan growth for banks nationwide hooks\ndownward in the first half of 2013, while in the district, it turns upward.\nHere’s a closer look at loan growth between June of 2012 and 2013:\n\n10\n\n\fLoan Growth\nJune 30, 2012—June 30, 2013\n\nNOTE: Eleventh District figures exclude Wells Fargo-South Central.\n\nYou can see in this chart how business loans contributed to total loan growth nationwide and in\nthe district. Business loans grew 6.8 percent for banks nationwide and 4.8 percent for those in the\ndistrict.\nWe do, however, continue to see pockets of weakness. Small-business lending was down 36\nbasis points year over year for banks in the U.S., while it increased only 1.6 percent\ndistrictwide.4\nSo let me summarize all of this:\n\n11\n\n\fConclusion\n• Both nationally and in the Eleventh District, profitability\ncontinues to improve\n• Asset quality showing slow, but steady, improvement\nacross the nation\n• Rebound in bank lending continues: Eleventh District\nbanks have expanded loans, while largest banks are\nliving off trading activity and lag in small-business\nlending\n\nProfitability continues to trend upward, although when we will make it back to precrisis levels\nremains to be seen. Asset quality is improving, but there is more work to be done. Lending\ncontinues to rebound: We’ve seen seven consecutive quarters of growth nationwide. However,\nareas of weakness remain, particularly small-business lending.\nThe issue of small-business lending and the difference between the drivers of income for the\nlargest banks and those with less than $250 billion in assets is a reminder of a lingering problem:\nThe coddling, whether intentionally or otherwise, of the biggest of the big banks—those\nconsidered too big to fail.\nFive Years After Lehman, We Still Have a Big Problem\nWorking with Harvey Rosenblum and my colleagues at the Dallas Fed, I have been a constant\nburr under the saddle of the too big to fails. In a nutshell, I believe that the megabanks are\ninherently handicapped by their size and scale in practicing the basic principle of banking: Know\nyour customer. Extreme size and complexity have proven to be the enemy of prudence and the\nsource of costly mistakes. Mathematically based risk-management models, while theoretically\ncomforting, have their deficiencies. We learned during the recent crisis just how perilous those\ndeficiencies can be.\nWe at the Dallas Fed believe, based on the experience of the last five years, that the largest\nfinancial institutions are a dagger pointed at the heart of our economy. We are not alone. Even\nthe local paper in the denizen of the megabanks, the New York Times, recently editorialized\nregarding the controversies surrounding JPMorgan Chase: “The underlying problem is not only\nthis or that violation, but the fact that the sheer size and scope and complexity of the banking\nbehemoths defy controls, encouraging speculation and bad behavior.”5\n\n12\n\n\fWe at the Dallas Fed would add that they undermine free-market capitalism and jeopardize our\neconomic welfare. But we would note that it is unfair to single out JPMorgan Chase as a culprit.\nIt is only one of a set of megabanks that remain a threat to financial stability. Indeed, Bob\nDiamond, the former head of the megabank Barclays, recently warned in a Financial Times oped that additional steps are needed “if we are to avoid the kind of capital regulatory arbitrage that\nweakened the financial system.”6\nAnd on Friday, the Wall Street Journal’s lead editorial said: “The policy of too big to fail has\nbeen codified and expanded. Dodd–Frank lets Washington’s wise men define ‘systemically\nimportant’ institutions subject to stricter regulation ... [But] Dodd–Frank’s … great conceit is\nthat in a crisis these firms will be wound down without a rescue. They even have to provide\n‘living wills’ that are supposed to plan the funeral. But the law also gives regulators the freedom\nto protect creditors as they see fit, which they will surely do in a panic. The difference next time\nwill be that more firms will be deemed too big to fail.” The Journal’s editorial highlighted this in\nbold print: “The financial system is more regulated than ever, but also no safer.”7\nIt would appear that the editors of these three great newspapers have been reading my speeches\nand Congressional testimony! They seem to agree with me and Harvey that TBTFs or\n“systemically important financial institutions” (SIFIs) might easily again play the nefarious role\nthey did five years ago in bringing down our economic and financial system. (The acronym SIFI\nsounds like some kind of communicable disease transmitted through reckless behavior. In the\nevent of another crisis brought on by the behavior that SIFIs still appear to have leeway to\nengage in, my guess is the acronym would come to stand for “Save If Failure Impending”).\nAm I exaggerating when I say that the TBTFs are a dagger pointed at the heart of the economy?\nTo be sure, there were many causes and tripwires for the financial debacle from which we are\nstill struggling to recover—a debacle that we at the Dallas Fed estimate cost more than an entire\nyear’s worth of U.S. economic output, or more than $120,000 per American household.8 Among\nthose causes and tripwires were the unbridled advent of toxic forms of structured finance,\ncomplicity by the ratings agencies, and even the Fed’s own role: keeping interest rates too low\nfor too long, rebuffing Fed Governor [Edward] Gramlich’s attempts to regulate subprime\nlending, and blessing the increased consolidation of banking.\nAs my Dallas Fed colleague, John Duca, gently reminds me, there was more than a little “we\nhave met the enemy and he is us” that contributed to the perfect storm of forces that led our\neconomy into that frightful and costly tailspin.9\nBut still, the TBTF behemoths were indisputably what the Bank of England’s Andy Haldane\ncalled “super-spreaders” of the virus that brought our financial system and economy to its\nknees.10 They retain that potential today. For in the aftermath of the crisis and the passage of\nDodd–Frank, the giants have gotten bigger, and the profitability of the community and regional\nbanks that might pose meaningful, healthy competition has been undermined by the legislation’s\ncomplexity.\nDodd–Frank claims to end TBTF. Instead, as the Wall Street Journal editorialized, it entrenches\nthe TBTF pathology. The megabanks remain a potential lethal force. As mentioned, I will be\nspeaking at length on this subject in New York in October.\n13\n\n\fA Deliberate Deflection\nAs I said at the beginning of my remarks, I am going to try to avoid answering questions you\nmight have about last week’s FOMC meeting and what some in the press have now labeled “the\ntaper caper.” Nearly every Federal Reserve Bank president and his or her sister will be speaking\nto this topic this week, so you will be getting an earful of cacophonous comments on this subject.\nToday, I will simply say that I disagreed with the decision of the committee and argued against\nit. Here is a direct quote from the summation of my intervention at the table during the policy\n“go round” when Chairman [Ben] Bernanke called on me to speak on whether or not to taper:\n“Doing nothing at this meeting would increase uncertainty about the future conduct of policy and\ncall the credibility of our communications into question.” I believe that is exactly what has\noccurred, though I take no pleasure in saying so.\nEnough said. Thank you for what you do for the business and citizens of Texas. And thank you\nfor listening.\nNotes\n1\n\nSince banks borrow short-term funds from depositors and lend for longer terms, the gap between interest earned on\nloans and interest paid to depositors typically benefits from a steep yield curve, or the difference between the yields\non the 10-year Treasury bond and the three-month Treasury bill.\n2\n“Trading revenue” represents the net gains/losses from trading cash instruments and derivative contracts.\n3\nThe “Texas ratio” is defined as the ratio of loans past-due 90 days or more, nonaccrual loans, and other real estate\nowned relative to equity capital, plus loan loss reserves, less intangibles.\n4\n“Small-business loans” are commercial and industrial loans and loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential property,\nwith original amounts of $1 million or less.\n5\n“Chasing JPMorgan Chase,” New York Times, Sept. 2, 2013, p.

Fisher\nEvery morning there is a quote of the day on the ubiquitous Bloomberg screens. Monday’s was\nespecially apt for today’s conference. It was from Frank Sinatra: “The best revenge is massive\nsuccess.”\nBill Simon asked me to provide context for your discussion of a manufacturing revival in the\nU.S.A. I am delighted to do so. It is well-nigh time for us to once again become a “massive\nsuccess” in manufacturing. But there are obstacles to doing so. If our manufacturing sector is to\nexperience a lasting renaissance, significant changes in fiscal policy and regulation that emanate\nfrom Washington are sorely needed.\nFirst, some historical context. Look at this chart:\n\nManufacturing Production Through the Century\nIndex, 100 = 2008:Q1\n110\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n'20 '25 '30 '35 '40 '45 '50 '55 '60 '65 '70 '75 '80 '85 '90 '95 '00 '05 '10\nNOTE: Shaded areas indicate recessions.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Board.\n\nU.S. manufacturing production was ramped up to fight the Second World War and, as you can\nsee, declined precipitously after the war’s end. Then starting in 1947 or thereabouts,\nmanufacturing output in America picked up slowly at first, adjusting to a post-WWII world,\nbefore accelerating to an expansion rate of 4.6 percent per annum from the time of the election of\n1\n\n\fPresident Kennedy until Paul Volcker’s Fed broke the back of inflation and engineered a\nrecession at the end of the 1970s. During the high-tech revolution of the 1990s, manufacturing\nproduction took off at a torrid pace, then bounced back from the tech wreck of the early 2000s\nuntil hitting the brick wall of the financial panic of 2007 and the severe recession that ensued.\nThe downturn in U.S. manufacturing output during the 2007–09 recession was on the order of 20\npercent, the worst setback but for the defense-related decline following WWII and the 54 percent\ndecline experienced during the Great Depression. Manufacturing output today is still about 5\npercent below its December 2007 business-cycle peak. 1\nAs for employment, manufacturing payrolls fell 16.6 percent between December 2007 and\nJanuary 2010. They are still 12.9 percent below where they stood 5 ½ years ago.\nThis raises the issue of productivity enhancement. Look at this chart:\n\nManufacturing Share of Nonfarm Payrolls\nPercent\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n'47\n\n'52\n\n'57\n\n'62\n\n'67\n\n'72\n\n'77\n\n'82\n\n'87\n\n'92\n\n'97\n\n'02\n\n'07\n\n'12\n\nNOTE: Shaded areas indicate recessions.\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSince the end of the post-WWII recession, manufacturers’ share of the nation’s payrolls has been\nin continual decline. Whereas at war’s end they represented 33 percent of nonfarm payrolls,\ntoday they account for less than 10 percent. To be sure, this reflects a rise in our nation’s\nprosperity: As nations grow richer, they produce and consume more services. Today,\nmanufacturing accounts for only about 12 percent of gross domestic product. The divergence\nbetween trends in job and output shares is largely accounted for by a relentless drive by\nmanufacturers to increase productivity. Workers today are dramatically more productive than the\n\n2\n\n\fworkers of our parents’ and grandparents’ generations because technology has enabled them to\nproduce more with fewer hours worked and at less cost.\nThis is not going to change. The iconic economist, Joseph Schumpeter, coined the phrase\n“creative destruction.” In plain English, this means “out with the old, in with the new.”\nAmericans are masters of replacing outdated methods with new ones. And it is by mastering new\ntechnology, new methodologies, and new techniques that we have the hope of revitalizing and\nbringing back to our shores a greater amount of the world’s manufacturing, regaining what was\nlost since the recession and—perhaps—bending upward the long-term manufacturing\nemployment curve.\nNow here is more recent history:\n\nMonthly PMIs Around the World and in the U.S.\nIndex, 50+ = Expansion\n65\n60\n55\n\nExpanding\n\n50\nContracting\n\n45\nAdvanced\n\n40\n\nEmerging\n35\n\nUnited States\n\n30\n'99\n\n'00\n\n'01\n\n'02\n\n'03\n\n'04\n\n'05\n\n'06\n\n'07\n\n'08\n\n'09\n\n'10\n\n'11\n\n'12\n\n'13\n\nNOTE: Shaded areas indicate recessions.

How do we reignite and\nsustain the manufacturing renaissance?\nMonday’s front-page article of the Wall Street Journal pointed to some of the sources of strength\nin U.S. manufacturing, citing my old friend Ernie Preeg (who used to supervise me in writing\neconomic policy decision memoranda for President Carter—which means Ernie must be 110\nyears old by now, a miracle of science!) and the work done by Hal Sirkin and his colleagues at\nthe Boston Consulting Group.\nThe article cited a critical factor influencing our destiny: the revolution occurring in oil and gas\nproduction. Thanks to a Houstonian named George Mitchell and other Schumpeterian\npractitioners who defied conventional wisdom and threw out the old and embraced the new, we\nhave developed an abundance of natural gas and liquids production that are the stuff of\nproduction and the enablers of consumption. This is captured graphically here:\n\n5\n\n\fU.S. Oil and Gas Production\nMillion barrels per day\n\nBillion cubic feet per day\n\n12\n\nJune ‘13\nestimate\n\n70\n\nCrude oil\n\n10\n\n80\n\nNatural gas surges\nfrom fracking boom\n\n60\n\n8\n50\n6\n\n40\nNatural gas\n\nOil production aided\nby deep water + other\ntechnologies\n\n4\n\n30\n20\n\n2\n10\n0\n1920\n\n0\n1930\n\n1940\n\n1950\n\n1960\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\nSOURCE: Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe Journal article also cited better relationships with unions and with workers in crafting\nflexible and innovative labor contracts, the rising cost of labor relative to productivity in China\nand the “world is our oyster” capacity for sales of exported U.S. manufactured goods, noting as\nexamples the overseas sales of Hypertherm and Graco.\nWhat the Journal article failed to cite is a historically profound enabler: Cheap and abundant\nmoney made possible by the Federal Reserve. I promised Bill Simon I would not venture into\nmonetary policy today, and I won’t. But I will say this: While there are many risks in the policy\nthat the Fed has been pursuing (and God and anyone who has suffered through my speeches the\npast few years knows I fret about those risks), every manufacturer of goods in America has been\ngiven a great gift by your central bank—the lowest cost of money in 237 years, an extension of\nthe roaring bond market rally that has now run 32 years, and a broad stock market rally that\nbegan in March of 2009 and has gone on to bust through all previous record highs. 2\nLook at this chart of the three-decade-old bond market rally:\n\n6\n\n\fNominal Bond Yields\nPercent\nSep.

And of course\nthere’s the slowdown in Europe and in some emerging markets. But the article skirted the most\nvexing and self-inflicted inhibitor of all: fiscal and regulatory policy of the gang that can’t shoot\nstraight in Washington.\nI have spoken of this for years.\nThe Constitution unambiguously gives the Congress of the United States control of the fiscal\npurse strings. Yet all they have done under both Republican and Democrat presidents and the\nleadership of both parties in the upper and lower houses is spend and regulate with abandon.\n\n7\n\n\fLet’s cut to the chase: The remaining obstacle to being the absolute best economy for\nmanufacturers and other businesses, bar none, has been fiscal and regulatory policy that seems\nincapable of providing job-creating manufacturers and other businesses with tax, spending and\nregulatory incentives to take advantage of the cheap and abundant fuel the Fed has provided.\nAfter recovering most of the losses from the Great Recession, manufacturing growth has, on net,\ndecelerated in the last two years. Ask any manufacturer what holds him or her back and they will\ntell you that they can’t operate in a fog of total uncertainty concerning how they will be taxed or\nhow government spending will impact them or their customers directly. And as to asking their\nopinion of the impact of regulation on their businesses—from the Affordable Care Act to the\nthousands of other regulations enumerated in the Federal Register—don’t even go there, unless\nyou delight in hearing profanities. I thought my college classmate Tom Stemberg, the founder of\nStaples, was remarkably constrained in his Wall Street Journal op-ed piece today as he pointed\nout that the 50,000 jobs he created from scratch might never have occurred under what he called\ntoday’s “blizzard of bureaucratic red tape.” 3\nWe needn’t be condemned to the glue factory. American companies publicly held and private—\nlarge, medium and small—have taken advantage of the cheap and abundant money made\navailable by the Fed’s very-accommodative monetary policy to create lean and muscular balance\nsheets. In response to the deep recession and the challenges of fiscal and regulatory uncertainty,\nthey have rationalized their cost structures and ramped up productivity, leveraging IT, just-intime inventory management and new production structures to the max. Their workers are more\nproductive than ever.\nI believe American manufacturers today have the potential, far and away, to be the most efficient\noperators in the world. We have countless manufacturers in every sector of goods production and\nassembly that are the equivalent of the Secretariats, Man o’ Wars, Citations, Seabiscuits or any\ngreat thoroughbred that has ever graced the track. They just need to be let out of the starting gate.\nThat gate is controlled by Congress, working with the president. If they would just let ’em rip,\nwe would have an economy that would take off. Instead of settling for being the “best-looking\nhorse in the glue factory,” we can become the wonder-horse that outpaces the rest of the world,\nputting the American people back to work and renewing the unparalleled magnificence of\nAmerican prosperity.\nHere is an image I want engraved in your minds. It is of Secretariat winning the Belmont Stakes\nby 31 lengths in 1973, leaving his competitors in the dust.\n\n8\n\n\fSecretariat Winning 1973 Belmont Stakes by 31 Lengths\n\n© Bob Coglianese\n\nI want our manufacturers to be Secretariats, beating out the rest of the world by a stunning\nmargin. We can do it. We must do it. We must insist that Congress practice a little\nSchumpeterianism of its own: throwing out old, counterproductive fiscal and regulatory policies\nand ushering in new ones that unleash job creators from the starting gates. Then we will\nexperience a “massive success.” And as Old Blue Eyes said, that massive success will be “the\nbest revenge”—sweet revenge, indeed, on those who say that a true renaissance of American\nmanufacturing is beyond our reach.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nAn alternate measure of output, called the value-added production series, shows that manufacturing output has\nnearly recovered its prerecession level.\n2\nSee remarks before the Ninth Annual Redefining Investment Strategy Education Forum, Dayton, Ohio, March 26,\n2009, www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2009/fs090326.cfm.\n3\n“A New Law to Liberate American Business,” by Thomas G.

Fisher\nThank you for that kind introduction, Dana [Bilyeu]. It is somehow comforting to speak to the\nNational Association of State Retirement Administrators. For you, like my colleagues and me at\nthe Federal Reserve, are faced with some very serious challenges. Angst, if not misery, does love\ncompany, especially in a beautiful setting such as Portland, Oregon, in August.\n\nYour anxious predicament—somehow untying the Gordian Knot of underfunded state retirement\nsystems—is summarized for the lay reader in this week’s cover article in the Economist\nmagazine.\n\nJuly 27th issue of The Economist\n\n1\n\n\fJuly 27th issue of The Economist\nPension funding gaps\nAdjusted net pension liabilities\nas a % of state revenues\nRank\n\nState\n\n%\n\n1\n\nIllinois\n\n241\n\n2\n\nConnecticut\n\n190\n\n3\n\nKentucky\n\n141\n\n4\n\nNew Jersey\n\n137\n\n5\n\nHawaii\n\n133\n\n46\n\nNew York\n\n17\n\n47\n\nIowa\n\n16\n\n48\n\nIdaho\n\n15\n\n49\n\nWisconsin\n\n14\n\n50\n\nNebraska\n\n7\n\nSOURCE: Moody’s; “Who Pays the Bills?”, The Economist, July 27, 2013.\n\nI will not attempt to advise you on how to manage the problems written about in that highly\nrespected magazine, as I am sure there will be abundant discussion about funding gaps\nthroughout this conference.\n\nOur predicament at the Federal Reserve is also widely written about. We too have a Gordian\nKnot to untangle. Like yours, it is anxiety inducing. Let me explain it to you, and in so doing,\nsuggest that we share a common interest in the Fed succeeding in its mission.\n\nA Brief Backgrounder on the Fed\nFirst, a little background on the Federal Reserve. The Fed is the central bank of the United\nStates. We operate under a license given to us by Congress one hundred years ago, a license that\nhas been amended on occasion but has, for the most part, remained intact. The Fed provides the\nfuel for the nation’s economic engine: We print money, supplying the liquidity needed for job\ncreators to put people to work and expand the wealth and output of the nation. And we are\ncharged with regulating deposit-taking institutions to make sure they are transmitting monetary\npolicy efficiently and operating prudently.\n\n2\n\n\fWe have to be careful in deploying the fuel we create, for like all fuels, ours is combustible.\nEmployed recklessly or without safeguard, it can lead to an explosion of inflation; if we are too\nmiserly, we risk an implosion of deflation. We can spark a destructive outbreak of speculation or\ninduce excessive risk aversion. We can enhance financial stability or exacerbate systemic\ninstability.\n\nThere are 12 Federal Reserve Banks; together we operate the business of the Fed. We make\nloans to banks. We distribute Federal Reserve notes, more commonly known as “dollars,” to\nbanks. (As an aside, if you look at a dollar bill you can see by the letter printed to the left of\nGeorge Washington which Federal Reserve District it originally came from: Those with an “L”\nare the ones ordered from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing by the San Francisco Fed for\nOregon and other states that make up the Twelfth Federal Reserve District; those with a “K” are\nfrom the Dallas Fed’s Eleventh District, covering principally Texas—these, of course, are the\nmost coveted!) And the 12 Federal Reserve banks house the ground forces of bank examiners\nwho supervise and regulate banks, bank holding companies, and savings and loan companies that\nlend and provide other services to Main Street.\n\nIt might interest you to know that none of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents or their staff is\na federal employee, though we work under the watchful eye of the Federal Reserve Board whose\ngovernors and staff are. I serve at the pleasure of a nine-person board of directors, chaired by the\nfounder of Southwest Airlines, Herb Kelleher; I do not serve at the pleasure of the president of\nthe United States, nor was I confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The seven members of the Board of\nGovernors, led by Ben Bernanke, are federal employees who are appointed by the president and\nconfirmed by the Senate. This is the way the Federal Reserve was set up by Congress under\nPresident Wilson so as to balance power between the political exigencies of Washington and the\nfinancial and economic needs of Main Street.\n\nMaking Monetary Policy\nIn addition to doing the Main Street work of the Federal Reserve System, the presidents of the 12\nFed Banks sit down with the seven Governors of the Fed Board in a body called the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (the FOMC) to decide the nation’s monetary policy. Together, we\ndecide how much fuel to inject into America’s $16 trillion economic engine.\n3\n\n\fJust as you and your trustees bear the fiduciary duty of properly managing and protecting the\nvalue of the pensions under your administration, we at the Fed are charged with the fiduciary\nduty of managing and protecting the value of our nation’s money supply. And just as your job is\nconditioned by decisions made by politicians outside of your control, so too is the Fed’s. Let me\nexplain.\n\nBy law we are charged by Congress with protecting the purchasing power of money from the\nravages of inflation or deflation, a directive we’ve been reasonably successful in satisfying over\nthe past 20 years or so. If we create too much money, we spur inflation; if we create too little,\ndeflation ensues. But Congress has also mandated that we conduct monetary policy so as to\nachieve full employment, a charge that we have the power to influence but cannot control. Much\nof the impetus for creating the conditions for full employment depends on how fiscal and\nregulatory actors incent job creators—where and how much to tax and spend and how businesses\nare regulated. These decisions are made by politicians the people elect, not by me and my\ncolleagues at the nation’s central bank. As long as inflation is held at bay, the Federal Reserve\ncan put the monetary pedal to the metal, but the vehicle of job creation will not move forward if\nthe fiscal and regulatory authorities have their foot firmly on the brake.\n\nYears of Extraordinary Measures\nFor six of my eight years at the Fed, we have been working to bring the nation’s economy out of\nrecession. The fiscal authorities have for the most part been AWOL during this time, having left\nthe parking brake on during their absence. This has placed the onus on the Bernanke-led Federal\nReserve. We have undertaken extraordinary measures, first to get the economy out of the\nemergency room after the financial system seizure of 2008-09, and more recently, to goose up\nthe private sector to expand payrolls. Toward this end, the Fed cut interest rates to their lowest\nlevels in the nation’s 237-year history by initially cutting the base rate for overnight interbank\nlending—the “fed funds rate”—to near zero, and then by purchasing massive amounts of U.S.\nTreasuries and bonds issued or backed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (obligations of\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac).\n\n4\n\n\fThis later program is referred to as quantitative easing, or QE, by the public and as large-scale\nasset purchases, or LSAPs, internally at the Fed. As a result of LSAPs conducted over three\nstages of QE, the Fed’s System Open Market Account now holds $2 trillion of Treasury\nsecurities and $1.3 trillion of agency and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Since last fall,\nwhen we initiated the third stage of QE, we have regularly been purchasing $45 billion a month\nof Treasuries and $40 billion a month in MBS, meanwhile reinvesting the proceeds from the\npaydowns of our mortgage-based investments. The result is that our balance sheet has ballooned\nto more than $3.5 trillion. That’s $3.5 trillion, or $11,300 for every man, woman and child\nresiding in the United States.\n\nThe theoretical mechanics behind QE are straightforward: When the Fed buys Treasuries and\nMBS, it pays for them, putting money into the economy. A key intent of this unprecedented\nprogram was to drive down interest rates to such a degree that businesses would achieve a\nfinancial comfort level that would induce them to put back to work the millions of Americans\nthat were laid off in the Great Recession. Thus far, only 76 percent of the jobs lost during 200809 have been clawed back in the more than three and a half years of modest to moderate payroll\ngains. This 76 percent figure does not include the 3 million or so jobs that would normally be\ncreated to absorb growth in the working-age population.\n\nMuscling the Yield Curve …\nThe efficacy of this effort is the subject of significant debate, even internally within the FOMC.\nSome who question the efficacy, including myself, note that the effect of our purchasing MBS\nand driving down mortgage rates has certainly assisted a robust recovery in housing, and with it,\nconstruction jobs and manufacturing and transportation of materials that go into homes. This was\nclear from reading the components of the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing\nindex released last Thursday, which showed the biggest one-month jump since 1996. Very\nliberal financing terms for automobiles that we have induced have coincided with an aging of the\nnation’s auto fleet to regenerate domestic auto sales to the 15.7 million units level. And the Fed’s\nmuscling of the yield curve has brought what has been a 30-year-long bond market rally to a\ncrescendo, as shown in the right-hand bottom corner of these slides.\n\n5\n\n\f10-Year Treasury Bond Yield\n\nPercent\n16\n\nSep.

Any CEO or CFO worth their salt—\nrunning a company that is large, medium or small, whether publicly or privately owned—has by\n6\n\n\fnow taken advantage of this to restructure the liability side of their balance sheet. Publicly held\ncompanies have benefitted even more as lower rates have driven a raging bull market for stocks.\nAs equity prices break new ground daily, the S&P 500 has soared 153 percent from its March\n2009 trough.\n\nAnd yet job creation has been slow in coming. On this crucial front—the second leg of our dual\nmandate—we do not seem to have achieved much with the trillions of dollars we have poured\ninto the economy through our three QE programs.\n\n… Is Accompanied by Costs\nCounteracting whatever benefits one can trace to the Fed’s unorthodox policies are some obvious\ncosts. First, savers and others who rely on retirement monies invested in short-maturity fixedincome investments, such as bank CDs and Treasury bills, have seen their income evaporate\nwhile the rich and the quick, the big money players of Wall Street have become richer still.\n\nSecond, the standard return assumptions of 7.5 to 8 percent for retirement pools, as you well\nknow, have been dashed (though I have always felt they were already calculated on an imaginary\nand politically convenient basis rather than a realistic one).\n\nThird, accompanying the Fed’s growing balance sheet we have seen a dramatic expansion in the\nmonetary base—the sum of reserves and currency. Currently, much of the monetary base has\npiled up in the form of excess reserves of banks who have not found willing or able borrowers.\nOther forms of surplus cash are lying fallow on the balance sheets of businesses or being\ndeployed in buying back shares and increasing dividend payouts so as to buttress company stock\nprices. A basic understanding of demand-pull inflation is “too much money chasing too few\ngoods.” Thus, the excess, currently nondeployed money could prove the kindling of an\ninflationary conflagration unless the Fed is nimble in managing its effect as it works its way into\nthe economy’s production and consumption of goods and services.\n\nA corollary of reining in this massive monetary stimulus in a timely manner is that financial\nmarkets may have become too accustomed to what some have depicted as a Fed “put.” Some\nhave come to expect the Fed to keep the markets levitating indefinitely. This distorts the pricing\n7\n\n\fof financial assets, encourages lazy analysis and can set the groundwork for serious misallocation\nof capital.\n\nThe Challenge of Untying the Monetary Gordian Knot\nThe challenge now facing the FOMC is that of deciding when to begin dialing back (or as the\nfinancial press is fond of reporting: “tapering”) the amount of additional security purchases. In\nhis press conference following our June FOMC meeting, speaking on behalf of the Committee,\nChairman Bernanke made clear the parameters for dialing back and eventually ending the QE\nprogram. Should the economy continue to improve along the lines then envisioned by\nCommittee, the market could anticipate our slowing the rate of purchases later this year, with an\neye toward curtailing new purchases as the unemployment rate broaches 7 percent and prospects\nfor solid job gains remain promising.\n\nKindly note that this does not mean that the Committee would envision raising the shorter term\nfed funds rate simultaneously; indeed, the Committee has said it expects this pivotal rate to\nremain between 0 and ¼ percent at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5\npercent, intermediate prospects for inflation are reasonable, and longer-term inflationary\nexpectations remain well anchored.\n\nHaving stated this quite clearly, and with the unemployment rate having come down to 7.4\npercent, I would say that the Committee is now closer to execution mode, pondering the right\ntime to begin reducing its purchases, assuming there is no intervening reversal in economic\nmomentum in coming months.\n\nThis is a delicate moment. The Fed has created a monetary Gordian Knot. You can see the\ndeveloping complexity of that knot in this sequence of slides tracing the change in our portfolio\nstructure with each phase of QE.\n\n8\n\n\fThe Fed’s Gordian Knot Problem\nFed assets,\n$ billions\nQE1\n\n4,000\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n\nFinancial market\nsupport, other\nMortgage-backed\nand agency\nsecurities\nLong-term\nTreasuries\nShort-term\nTreasuries\n\nMortgage-backed\nand agency\nsecurities\n\nShort-term Treasuries\n\nLong-term Treasuries\n\n500\n0\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nNOTE: Large-scale asset purchase programs, popularly known as quantitative easing (QE), began by the FOMC in\nlate 2008 when the Federal Reserve purchased long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed and agency securities.\n\nThe Fed’s Gordian Knot Problem\nFed assets,\n$ billions\n\nQE2\n\nQE1\n\n4,000\n\nQE1\nextended\n\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n\nFinancial market\nsupport, other\nMortgage-backed\nand agency\nsecurities\nLong-term\nTreasuries\nShort-term\nTreasuries\n\nShort-term Treasuries\n\n500\n0\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n9\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n\fThe Fed’s Gordian Knot Problem\nFed assets,\n$ billions\n\nQE2\n\nQE1\nextended\n\n3,500\n\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n\nQE3\n\nQE1\n\n4,000\n\n3,000\n\nOperation\ntwist\n\nFinancial market\nsupport, other\nMortgage-backed\nand agency\nsecurities\nLong-term\nTreasuries\nShort-term\nTreasuries\n\nShort-term Treasuries\n\n500\n0\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nNOTE: In the maturity-extension program, also known as “Operation Twist,” the Federal Reserve sold short-term\nsecurities while purchasing longer-term securities.\n\nThe Fed’s Gordian Knot Problem\nFed assets,\n$ billions\n\nQE2\n\nQE1\nextended\n\n3,500\n\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n\nQE3\n\nQE1\n\n4,000\n\n3,000\n\nOperation\ntwist\n\nFed balance\nsheet on track\nto exceed\n$3.7 trillion\nbefore the\nSeptember\nFOMC meeting\n\nFinancial market\nsupport, other\nMortgage-backed\nand agency\nsecurities\nLong-term\nTreasuries\nShort-term\nTreasuries\n\nShort-term Treasuries\n\n500\n0\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nNOTE: Estimated size of the securities portfolio will exceed $3.7 trillion if net purchases continue along the same\ntrend as they have year-to-date.\n\nWhereas before, our portfolio consisted primarily of instantly tradable short-term Treasury\npaper, now we hold almost none; our portfolio consists primarily of longer-term Treasuries and\nMBS. Without delving into the various details and adjustments that could be made (such as\nconsiderations of assets readily available for purchase by the Fed), we now hold roughly 20\n10\n\n\fpercent of the stock and continue to buy more than 25 percent of the gross issuance of Treasury\nnotes and bonds. Further, we hold more than 25 percent of MBS outstanding and continue to take\ndown more than 30 percent of gross new MBS issuance. Also, our current rate of MBS purchases\nfar outpaces the net monthly supply of MBS.\n\nThe point is: We own a significant slice of these critical markets. This is, indeed, something of a\nGordian Knot.\n\nThose of you familiar with the Gordian legend know there were two versions to it: One holds\nthat Alexander the Great simply dispatched with the problem by slicing the intractable knot in\nhalf with his sword; the other posits that Alexander pulled the knot out of its pole pin, exposed\nthe two ends of the cord and proceeded to untie it. According to the myth, the oracles then\ndivined that he would go on to conquer the world.\n\nThere is no Alexander to simply slice the complex knot that we have created with our rounds of\nQE. Instead, when the right time comes, we must carefully remove the program's pole pin and\ngingerly unwind it so as not to prompt market havoc. For starters though, we need to stop\nbuilding upon the knot. For this reason, I have advocated that we socialize the idea of the\ninevitability of our dialing back and eventually ending our LSAPs. In June, I argued for the\nChairman to signal this possibility at his last press conference and at last week’s meeting\nsuggested that we should gird our loins to make our first move this fall. We shall see if that\nrecommendation obtains with the majority of the Committee.\n\nAs administrators of our states’ retirement funds, you have a vested interest in the Fed’s success.\nAfter all, the promises made to the good people who have worked for your states can only be\nkept if financial stability reigns, employment increases and economic growth improves. I believe\nwe are capable of achieving these things, despite suggestions by some that we are locked into a\nsecular trend of subpar growth; I believe that the U.S. is capable of significant economic growth\ngoing forward. But only if the nation’s fiscal authorities get their act together and develop\npolicies that complement rather than retard the good that prudent monetary policy can achieve.\nThe fiscal folks need to end the behavior parodied in this little video clip.\nwww.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Df_6r_tZqGo\n11\n\n\fOur elected officials’ traditional approach to fiscal matters has been about as cavalier as what\nyou just saw. Given their dissolute behavior, against the background of the problems that beset\nEurope, the long-standing stagnation of Japan, and the challenges that face China and the\nemerging market economies that have prospered from supplying the materials needed for\nChinese growth, I have often said that “the U.S. is the best-looking horse in the glue factory.”\nWeak as we have been, we are the best compared to all the rest. I have argued that the principal\nforce holding us back from being the absolute best economy, bar none, has been fiscal\nmanagement that seems incapable of providing job creators with tax, spending and regulatory\nincentives to take advantage of the cheap and abundant fuel the Fed has provided so that\nbusinesses can put the American people back to work.\n\nI have argued that whatever success we have achieved in clawing our way out of the “Great\nRecession” has been despite the fiscal and regulatory authorities. Ask any businessman or\nwoman what holds him or her back and they will tell you it’s not monetary policy; it is that they\ncan’t operate in a fog of total uncertainty concerning how they will be taxed or how government\nspending will impact them or their customers directly. And as to asking their opinion of the\nimpact of regulation on their businesses, don’t even go there, unless you delight in hearing\nprofanities.\n\nHorseshift!\nWe needn’t be condemned to the glue factory. As I said, American companies publicly held and\nprivate—large, medium and small—have taken advantage of the cheap and abundant money\nmade available by the Fed’s hyper-accommodative monetary policy to create lean and muscular\nbalance sheets. In response to the deep recession and the challenges of fiscal and regulatory\nuncertainty, they have rationalized their cost structures and ramped up productivity, leveraging\nIT, just-in-time inventory management and new production structures to the max. I believe\nAmerican businesses today are, far and away, the most efficient operators in the world. We have\ncountless businesses in every sector of goods and service production that are the equivalents of\nthe Secretariats, Man o’ Wars, Citations, Seabiscuits or any great thoroughbred that has ever\ngraced the track. They just need to be let out of the starting gate.\n\n12\n\n\fThat gate is controlled by Congress, working with the president. If they would just let 'em rip, we\nwould have an economy that would soar. We would experience what, tongue firmly but\nconfidently in cheek, I would call “horseshift”: from being the stuff of an economic glue factory\nto becoming the wonder-horse that would outpace the rest of the world, putting the American\npeople back to work and renewing the wonder of American prosperity. If you and your fellow\ncitizens from whatever state you hail from insist upon it, it will be done.\nSecretariat Winning 1973 Belmont Stakes by 31 Lengths\n\n©Bob Coglianese\n\nThank you.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nWashington, D.C.\n2128 Rayburn House Office Building\nJune 26, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fCorrecting ‘Dodd–Frank’ to Actually End ‘Too Big to Fail’\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nTestimony before the Committee on Financial Services\nU.S. House of Representatives\nHearing on “Examining How the Dodd–Frank Act Could Result in\nMore Taxpayer-Funded Bailouts”\nJune 26, 2013\n\nChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and Members of the Committee,\nthank you for the opportunity to testify at this hearing on “Examining How the\nDodd–Frank Act Could Result in More Taxpayer-Funded Bailouts.”\n\nBefore I begin, I want to recognize the common goal that we all share—ending\n“too big to fail” (TBTF) and taxpayer-funded bailouts. However, as iconic patriot\nPatrick Henry said in one of his greatest speeches, “Different men often see the\nsame subject in different lights.” I recognize and respect a difference of opinion on\nthis critical issue of how to eliminate taxpayer-funded bailouts. But I trust that in\nthe marketplace of ideas and after careful deliberation—such as this hearing—our\ndemocratic process will shine through and decisions will be made that are in the\nbest interest of our country.\n\nIn the same speech, Patrick Henry also appealed to all perspectives to do right:\n“This is no time for ceremony,” he said, for it “…is one of awful moment to this\ncountry.”\n\n1\n\n\fThe great patriot was, of course, addressing the injustice of perpetuating the rule of\nthe British Crown. This morning, I want to address what I consider the injustice of\nperpetuating financial institutions that are so large, complex and opaque that they\nare seen as critical to the proper functioning of our economy and are therefore\nconsidered TBTF.\n\nI will argue that these institutions operate under a privileged status that exacts an\nunfair and nontransparent tax upon the American people and represents not only a\nthreat to financial stability, but to the rule of law as well as principles of fair and\nopen competition—hallmarks of the democratic capitalism that makes our country\ngreat.\n\nI will argue that the effort crafted by Congress to correct the problems of TBTF—\nknown as the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n(Dodd–Frank)—is, despite its best intentions, ineffective, burdensome, imposes a\nprohibitive cost burden on the non-TBTF banking institutions and needs to be\namended. It is an example of the triumph of hope over experience.\n\nAnd, lastly, I will argue that dealing with TBTF is a cause that should be embraced\nby Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike. For regardless of your\nideological bent, there is no escaping the reality that TBTF banks’ bad decisions\ninflicted harm upon the American people in the excessive credit boom through\n2007 and particularly during the “awful moment” of the 2008–09 crisis.1 The\nAmerican people will be grateful to whoever liberates them from the risk of a\nrecurrence of taxpayer bailouts and the serious threat of another Great Depression.\n\n2\n\n\fFederal Reserve convention requires that I issue a disclaimer here: As is our\npractice, I speak only for myself, not for others associated with our nation’s central\nbank. There are different views on this issue even within the Fed; like Patrick\nHenry’s co-patriots, we too “see the same subject in different lights.” In addition to\nJeff Lacker, President of the Richmond Fed, who is here with us today, the\nchairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, and three other governors, Jeremy Stein,\nDaniel Tarullo and Jerome Powell, all good friends and men I greatly admire, have\nexpressed different views than ours in Dallas about how to address the problem of\nTBTF. You should consider their views, as well as those of Mr. Hoenig and Ms.\nBair who join Mr. Lacker and me on this panel.2 Today, I’ll simply give you the\nviews that have been thought through over several years by my colleagues and me\nat the Dallas Fed.\n\nWhat’s the Problem?\nLess than a dozen megabanks—a mere 0.2 percent of all banking organizations—\ncontrol two-thirds of the assets in the U.S. banking industry. The concentration of\nassets has been ongoing for more than 30 years, but it picked up pace in the 1990s\nand greatly intensified during the 2008–09 financial crisis, when several failing\ngiants were absorbed, with taxpayers’ support, by larger, presumably healthier\nones.\n\nThe result is a lopsided financial system, and the episode we all experienced in\n2008–09 is one we are still in the process of recovering from. None of us ever wish\nto experience another catastrophe such as occurred in fall 2008. Yet, given the\nwell-intentioned but impracticable reforms forged in the crucible of the crisis, I\nbelieve the likelihood and severity of another crisis have risen rather than receded.\n\n3\n\n\fHere are the facts: Today, we have about 5,500 banking organizations in the\nUnited States. Nearly each and every one of these bank holding companies\nrepresents no threat to the survival of our economic system. But less than a dozen\nof the largest and most complex banks are each capable—through a series of\nmissteps by their management—of seriously damaging the vitality, resilience and\nprosperity that has personified the U.S. economy. Any of these megabanks, given\ntheir systemic footprint and interconnectedness with other large financial\ninstitutions, could threaten to bring down the economy, again. This 0.2 percent of\nbanks, deemed candidates to be considered “too big to fail,” is treated differently\nfrom the other 99.8 percent and differently from other businesses (Figure 1).\n\nImplicit government policy has made these megabank institutions exempt from the\nnormal processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction. TBTF is a euphemism\nfor a financial institution so large, interconnected and/or complex that its functions\nare seen as critical and policymakers think its demise could substantially damage\nthe financial system and economy if it were allowed to fail. Without fear of\n4\n\n\fclosure, these banks and their counterparties can take excessive risks. We regularly\nsee this reported in the press: Megabanks are too often driven by a culture directed\nmore toward the generation of revenue growth to inflate their share price, without\nsufficient regard to prudent risk management. Executives and investors capture the\nupside; the taxpayers bear the downside risk (although this is not measured in our\nfederal budget).\n\nIn our capitalist economic system, when companies that experience difficulties fail,\ntheir business models are rationalized, streamlined and reorganized. The highly\ndiverse economic engine of growth that is the United States has become robustly\ndynamic upon the currents of what the renowned economist Joseph Schumpeter\ntermed “creative destruction”—a “reap what you sow,” free-market process of\nsuccess and failure, innovation and obsolescence. Viable business models should\nbe given the opportunity to compete and prosper on their own merits, while\nunattractive strategies should be allowed to fail. Subverting the ability to fail, on\nthe taxpayers’ dime, is a perversion of American capitalism.\n\nAdvantages to being Too Big, Too Complex, Too Opaque\nThe playing field is tilted to the advantage of the megabanks that can raise capital\nmore cheaply than their smaller competitors due to perceived taxpayer support.\nStudies, including those published by the International Monetary Fund and the\nBank for International Settlements, estimate this advantage to be as much as 1\npercentage point, or some $50 billion to $100 billion annually for U.S. TBTF\nbanks, during the period surrounding the financial crisis.3 In a popular post by\neditors at Bloomberg, the 10 largest U.S. banks are estimated to enjoy an aggregate\nlonger-term subsidy of $83 billion per year.4\n\n5\n\n\fAndy Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England,\nestimates the current implicit TBTF subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for\nthe 29 global institutions identified as “systemically important.”5\n\nLarge banks and their allies have pushed back against these points, producing a\nflurry of counter-claims in recent months. My staff and I have reviewed these\narguments and have found them to be assertions lacking merit.\n\nGiven this range of estimates, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and David Vitter of\nLouisiana have asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to calculate\njust how much of a cost-of-funds advantage the big banks have over the mid-sized\nand smaller community banking organizations that make up the 99.8 percent that\nare not implicitly protected from failure.\n\nAs pointed out by Simon Johnson, the MIT economist and former chief economist\nat the International Monetary Fund, all one has to do is ask people in the credit\nmarkets if they think lenders to the biggest banks have some degree of protection\noffered by the government, and you will hear a resounding “yes.”6\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we believe that whatever the precise subsidy number is, it exists,\nit is significant and it encourages the biggest banking organizations, along with\ntheir many nonbank subsidiaries (investment firms, securities lenders, finance\ncompanies), to grow larger and riskier.\n\nThis entire arrangement is patently unfair. It makes for an uneven playing field,\ntilted to the advantage of Wall Street against Main Street, placing the financial\nsystem and the economy in constant jeopardy.\n6\n\n\fThe Problem Magnified, Not Solved\nThe Dodd–Frank Act was a well-intentioned response to the problem. We respect\nits drafters and those who crafted it in an earnest attempt to address much needed\nreform in the financial services industry. However, its stated promise to end too big\nto fail rings hollow. Running 849 pages and with more than 9,000 pages of\nregulations written so far to implement it, Dodd–Frank is long on process and\ncomplexity but short on results. Consequently, nearly three years after Dodd–\nFrank was signed into law, very little positive reform has been implemented.\n\nRegulators cannot enforce rules that are not easily understood. Nor can they\nenforce these rules without creating armies of new supervisors. This venerable\nCommittee on Financial Services aggregates information from the Federal Register\nthat estimates the cumulative hours needed for the affected agencies, like the Fed,\nto fulfill new requirements called for by Dodd–Frank. This Committee presently\nestimates that it will take 24,180,856 hours each year to comply with new rules\nalready finalized for implementation of the act.7 And we have yet to complete the\nrulemaking process!\n\nI work every day with my colleagues at the Fed to craft the monetary conditions to\nhelp the economy create jobs. This is not the kind of job creation I would hope for.\n\nI doubt anyone seriously believes that an additional several thousand pages of\nregulations, on top of the nine thousand already written, will provide clarity,\nprocedural focus and the proper incentives to end TBTF and to “Just Say No” to\nmore government bailouts.\n\n7\n\n\fComplex regulations create barriers to entry and encourage firms to morph into\neven more complex and opaque structures. Further, regulatory supervision, by\ndefinition, is always at least one step behind the actions taken by market\nparticipants. The more complex the rules, the more difficult it is to bridge the gap\ndue to the complexities of financial markets. None of this is helpful for financial\nstability.\n\nBailout Concerns Linger\nBriefly, I believe the current legislative solution to ending TBTF has actually\nexacerbated the issue and potentially codified TBTF, rather than eliminated it.\n\nAs soon as a financial institution is designated “systemically important” as\nrequired under Title I of Dodd–Frank (and becomes known by the acronym\n“SIFI”), it is viewed by the market as being the first to be saved by the first\nresponders in a financial crisis. In other words, these “SIFIs” occupy a privileged\nspace in the financial system (one pundit referred to the acronym as meaning “Save\nIf Failure Impending”). As a corollary, a banking customer has a disincentive to do\nbusiness with smaller competitors, because a non-SIFI does not have an implied\ngovernment funding lifeline. Even if a SIFI ends up funding itself with more equity\ncapital than a smaller competitor, the choice remains for where you would like to\nhold important financial relationships: with an institution with a government\nbackstop or one without? Thus, the playing field remains uneven; the advantages\nof size and perceived subsidy accrue to the behemoth banks that will continue to\ngrow larger and become even more of a systemic risk. Dodd–Frank does not\neliminate this perception and in many ways perpetuates it as reality.\nFurther, some have held out hope that a key provision of Title I requiring banking\norganizations to submit detailed plans for their orderly resolution in bankruptcy,\n8\n\n\fwithout government assistance, will provide for a roadmap to avoid bailouts.\nHowever, these “living wills” are likely to prove futile in helping navigate a realtime “systemic” failure. Given the complexity and opacity of the TBTF institutions\nand the ability to move assets and liabilities across subsidiaries and affiliates (as\nwell as off-balance sheet, including through huge and fast-moving derivative\npositions), a living will would likely be ineffective when it really mattered. I do not\nhave much faith in the living will process to make any material difference in TBTF\nrisks and behaviors—a bank would run out of liquidity (not capital) due to\nreputational risk quicker than management would work with regulators to execute\na living will blueprint.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Title II of Dodd–Frank describes and designates the\nOrderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) as the resolution mechanism to handle the\ndisposal of a giant, systemically-disruptive financial enterprise. The three letters\nthemselves evoke the deceptive doublespeak of an Orwellian nightmare. The “L,”\nwhich stands for liquidation, will in practice become a simulated restructuring, as\nwould occur in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nIn reality, rather than fulfill Dodd–Frank’s promise of “no more taxpayer-funded\nbailouts,” the U.S. Treasury will likely provide, through the FDIC, debtor-inpossession financing to the failed companies’ artificially-kept-alive operating\nsubsidiaries for up to five years, but perhaps longer. Under the single point of entry\nmethod, the operating subsidiaries remain protected as the holding company is\nrestructured. So if a company does business with the operating subsidiaries, say,\nthrough derivatives transactions, then this company is even more confident that\ntheir counterparty is TBTF. Some officials refer to this procedure as a “liquidity\n\n9\n\n\fprovision” rather than a bailout. Call it whatever you wish, but this is taxpayer\nfunding at far-below-market rates.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we would call this form of “liquidation” a nationalized financial\ninstitution. During the five-year resolution period, this nationalized institution does\nnot have to pay any taxes of any kind to any government entity. To us, this looks,\nsounds, and tastes like a taxpayer bailout, just hidden behind different language. If\nit waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\n\nMoreover, if the reorganized company cannot repay the Treasury for its debtor-inpossession financing, Title II suggests that the repayment should be clawed back\nvia a special assessment on the company’s SIFI competitors. But that assessment is\nthen written off as a tax-deductible business expense, thereby reducing revenue to\nthe Treasury. This is a \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" chain of events, with the taxpayer\nplaying the role of Peter. Although I have not seen the Congressional Budget\nOffice run the numbers for the plausible scenarios, I suspect that the impact on our\nfederal deficit and debt would be significant, not to mention the potential effects\nfrom the concomitant recession that would likely occur. This does not sound like a\n“no taxpayer-funded bailouts” solution. One form of explicit intervention appears\nto have been replaced by Title II of Dodd–Frank, a disguised form of taxpayer\nbailout.\n\nTitle II promotes and sustains an unnatural longevity for zombie financial\ninstitutions—and this is an acute issue in other financial systems, including parts of\nEurope today. Title II imposes a competitive disadvantage onto small- and\nmedium-size financial institutions, and it does so for potentially several years at\ntaxpayer expense. It is these smaller financial institutions that, by the way, provide\n10\n\n\fthe primary financial lifeline so vital to the small- and medium-size businesses in\nyour Congressional districts that, in turn, provide the bulk of innovation and job\ncreation in the United States.8\n\nThis Committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing on\nMay 15, 2013, in this very room that focused on Title II in great detail. The four\nwitnesses who testified that day gave a very informative and expert critique of the\nshortcomings of Title II, and I respectfully refer you to that hearing.9\n\nA Simple Proposal\nWhere does the current reform effort leave us and how should we forge a path\nforward? Despite the plethora of new rules and regulations created by Dodd–\nFrank, market discipline is still lacking for the largest financial institutions, as it\nwas during the last crisis. Why should a prospective purchaser of bank debt or\nother type of counterparty practice due diligence if, in the end, regardless of new\nlayers of regulation and oversight, it is widely perceived that the issuing institution\nand its subsidiaries will not be allowed to fail? There is a great deal of moral\nhazard at all levels of decision-making in our current financial system. We must\nchange this status quo.\n\nThe return of marketplace discipline and effective due diligence of banking\nbehemoths is long overdue. My colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed offer a modest\nproposal to that end, with a goal of leveling the playing field for all.\n\nHere is a simple graphic of the basic organizational structure of a typical financial\nholding company (Figure 2). Note that the highlighted commercial bank operation\nwithin that structure. To begin with, we would roll back the federal safety net—\n11\n\n\fdeposit insurance and the Federal Reserve’s discount window—to where it was\nalways intended to be, that is, to traditional commercial bank deposit and lending\nintermediation and payment system functions.10 Thus, the safety net would only be\navailable to traditional commercial banks and not to the nonbank affiliates of bank\nholding companies or the parent companies themselves. This is how the law needs\nto be applied, even in times of crisis.11\n\nSecond, customers, creditors and counterparties of all nonbank affiliates and the\nparent holding companies would sign a simple, legally binding, unambiguous\ndisclosure acknowledging and accepting that there is no government guarantee—\never—backstopping their investment (Figure 3). They are on their own, and they\nknow it. A similar disclaimer would apply to banks’ deposits outside the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) protection limit and other unsecured debts.\n\n12\n\n\fKnowing where the federal government guarantees begin and end would properly\nrealign incentives and reinvigorate a degree of creditor discipline that has been\ndormant at large, complex financial institutions for far too long.\n\nThird, we recommend that the largest financial holding companies be restructured\nso that every one of their corporate entities is subject to a speedy bankruptcy\nprocess, and in the case of the banking entities themselves, that they become an\nappropriate size, complexity and geographic footprint that is “too small to save.”12\nAddressing institutional size is vital to maintaining a credible threat of failure,\nthereby providing a convincing case that policy has truly changed. This step gets\nboth bank incentives and structure right, neither of which is accomplished by\nDodd–Frank.\n\nOur third step would provide a more level playing field with reduced regulatory\ncosts for all competitors, encourage greater innovation by all members of the\n13\n\n\fbanking industry and minimize the downside consequences to the economy of\nmegabank failures. The downsized, formerly too-big-to-fail banks would then be\nsmall and simple enough (just like the other 99.8 percent) that, with adequate\nplanning, the FDIC could close and then reopen the bank in short order with new\nmanagement and new private-sector ownership. “Closed on Friday and reopened\non Monday” is the customary process administered by the FDIC that we would like\nto see applicable for all depository financial institutions.\n\nNo bank would remain so significant and interconnected to the financial system\nthat its demise would spell the unraveling of the financial system. In these new\ncircumstances, all banks that warranted closure would fail the old fashioned way;\nthey would be gone, with their stockholders’ equity written down to zero, their\nbondholders saddled with haircuts and their insured depositors left unharmed.\n\nWhat’s The Way Forward?\nThe aim of our three-step proposal is simple: All banks would be subject to\nregulatory oversight that fits its business model—and most important, all banks\nwould be subject to the market discipline exercised by owners and creditors. Given\nthis more explicit treatment of creditors of regulated commercial banks, creditors\nof unregulated shadow banks should begin to understand that government\nguarantees don’t apply to their transactions with the affiliates of regulated\ncommercial banks nor with unregulated financial companies that offer similar\nproducts and services. Market discipline could then begin to reinforce and even\nsomewhat replace regulatory discipline.\n\nSome argue that these three steps are already at work within the current regulatory\nand legal framework. Others cautiously warn that we should wait to see how all of\n14\n\n\fthe rules and regulations of Dodd–Frank are implemented before we attempt any\nimprovements. Both perspectives might underappreciate the urgency we feel to\ncorrect the current imbalance and perversion of capitalism before the next crisis,\nnot after.\n\nArguments to “give Dodd–Frank a chance” or to simply address TBTF with higher\ncapital requirements (and not complementary structural changes) fall short of\nnecessary action. Living wills and higher capital requirements are potentially very\nhelpful tools but are not sufficient to ensure the survival of a company, and they\nwill not eliminate massive losses that can choke off liquidity and disrupt financial\nmarkets and the economy.\n\nBanks are levered institutions and are vulnerable given that they are usually\nlevered with short-term debt like deposits and repo-like funding vehicles. Thus,\ncapital helps to maintain confidence that the institution can sustain some losses and\nstill remain open for business tomorrow. But once investors and creditors begin to\nfear that losses have been understated or forthcoming at that institution or similar\ninstitutions, confidence begins to rapidly diminish, and almost no amount of capital\nis sufficient to forestall a collapse of confidence and a liquidity crisis. When\nconfidence begins to wane, liquidity dries up quickly. And the plunge in\nconfidence is contagious, often having little to do with the underlying situation of\neach company. That’s where the lender of last resort function of the Federal\nReserve comes into play—the central bank lends to solvent companies, those with\npositive capital and good collateral. But such capital is only a small element in\nsaving a company from extinction. Confidence matters even more.\n\n15\n\n\fWithin the category of capital, it is loss-absorbing capital that buttresses\nconfidence the most. Equity capital is the first to absorb losses; hence, it is the\nmost expensive capital to raise. Debt doesn’t absorb losses except in bankruptcy, at\nwhich point the company is dead. Risk-weighted capital is somewhat\nmeaningless—and sometimes deeply misleading—in the context of loss\nabsorbency; any asset that incurs losses must be written off against equity capital,\nwhether the loss was in business loans, mortgage loans, municipal bonds or agency\ndebt. If losses thin out the capital cushion to the point of undermining confidence,\nthe future viability of the company slips. Nobody knows the magic capital ratio\nthat will prevent a loss of confidence, and I do not believe regulators will suddenly\nbecome better equipped to set higher magical ratios in the future for the largest,\nmost politically-connected banking institutions. Capital is necessary for viability\n(nonfailure), and I support higher capital requirements (particularly for any\ninstitution that could become of systemic importance), but it is not sufficient.\n\nWe concede that our proposal doesn’t have all the answers either. It would not\neliminate financial crises—that would be an impossible or even foolish goal—but\nit should reduce their frequency and severity. Nor will it alter the human DNA of\nthose who serve as “first responders” during the next crisis. Our proposal should\nmake the magnitude of the problems regulators face, and the tasks they need to\nperform, far more manageable. Under our plan, supervisory agencies would\noversee several thousand community banks, a few hundred moderate-size banks\n(by today’s standards) and no megabanks. The nonbank and shadow bank\ncomponents of a large financial holding company would still operate but without\nsubsidy and access to the safety net and with long-overdue market discipline\nimposed by at-risk creditors.\n\n16\n\n\fThere will always be some banks that are larger than the rest, and consequently,\nthere will be temptation for regulators to label the “biggest few” as systemically\nimportant. The fluctuating nature of human resolve and political fortitude, as well\nas the problem of “regulatory capture,” has been present in U.S. bank policy at\nleast since the intervention/bailout of Continental Illinois and its creditors in 1984.\nOur proposal may not prohibit regulators from intervening to support the\nunsecured creditors of a failing banking institution. But our proposal reduces the\ndimensions of the problem—asset size and systemic interconnectedness—by an\norder of magnitude and thereby should diminish the tendency to intervene out of\nfear of unknown systemic risks. Our plan would dramatically reduce the costs of\nnonintervention.\n\nThe elimination of TBTF along the lines we have proposed will not, as the\nmegabanks suggest, diminish our nation’s competitive advantage in global\nfinancial markets. If anything, our proposal may help drive innovation in our\nfinancial system by leveling the playing field.\n\nThe former safety net implicitly covered too much of a selective part of the credit\nintermediation system, promoting perverse risk-taking incentives. We believe that\nhad the Dallas Fed plan I have articulated today been in place a decade ago, it\nwould have altered the insidious behaviors that contributed to the crisis, avoiding\nthe bailouts and their aftermath, the cost of which our nation’s citizens will endure\nfor years to come.13 We believe that had our plan helped guide the restructuring of\nthe banking and financial services industry before the crisis began, neither\nCitigroup, Bank of America, nor others would have been positioned to receive\nhundreds of billions of dollars of extraordinary government assistance; the parts of\nthese companies that got into trouble would have been sold off, closed or run\n17\n\n\fthrough a standard bankruptcy process. The taxpayers would never have been\ninvolved.\n\nThe same could be said of Bear Stearns; the first shadow bank to require\ngovernment assistance back in March 2008 would have been governed by market\ndiscipline and unable to call upon giant banking institutions to find an over-theweekend, government-assisted acquisition because there would have been no\nmegabanks to invite to the table. Further, the more disciplined financial\nmarketplace that would result from the adoption of our proposal likely would have\nhelped prevent a concentration of risks and imbalances of the magnitude that\noccurred at AIG. This is the ultimate test and counterfactual thought experiment\nfor any proposal to end TBTF. The GAO and others estimate that the cost of the\nfinancial crisis, measured in lost consumption and jobs, could exceed $14 trillion,\nor roughly one whole year of U.S. output.14\n\nWe do not think Dodd–Frank would have averted the 2008–09 financial crisis and\nits horrendous costs and consequences had the act been in place and implemented\nin the years before the crisis began. Were we to have another crisis today, we\nbelieve that the cost would be even greater because, in effect, rather than in theory,\nDodd–Frank entrenches and perpetuates TBTF banks that are now even bigger\nthan they were before.\n\nAn Appeal for Action\nIn my introduction, I referred to Patrick Henry. In the speech I quoted, he went on\nto say, “It is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut\nour eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she\ntransforms us.” I implore the members of this important committee and the\n18\n\n\fCongress to not succumb merely to the illusion of hope. Don’t listen to the siren\nsong of the megabanks and their lobbyists. Take action to deal with the unfair\nadvantages that these institutions enjoy. They will spend millions of dollars to try\nto perpetuate their brand of crony capitalism. Resisting their entreaties is the right\nthing to do. Leveling the playing field is a just cause for 99.8 percent of American\nbanks and for all Americans.\n\nThe potential taxpayer burden of dealing with TBTF institutions might be\naddressed by a still-growing army of bank supervisory personnel trying to enforce\nthe rigid, complex and probably easy-to-evade rules of Dodd–Frank. However, this\nwould be oversight without the benefit of supplemental reinforcement from market\ndiscipline and increased due diligence.\n\nIn March of this year, the Dallas Fed released an annual report on “Vanquishing\nToo Big to Fail.” 15 The contents of this report explored the merits of community\nbanks, the adverse effects of current reform efforts and the urgency of reasserting\nmarket discipline for all institutions—large and small—to compete on a more level\nplaying field. Accompanying these essays is a series of responses to the questions\nand criticisms we have received about our proposal, including those raised by\nproponents for the megabanks. This “Q&A with Richard Fisher on TBTF” can be\nfound at www.dallasfed.org/microsites/fed/annual/2012/ar12c/index.cfm.\n\nUnfortunately, a subsidy once given is nearly impossible to take away.\nOvercoming entrenched oligopoly forces, in combination with customer inertia,\nmay require government-sanctioned reorganization and restructuring of the TBTF\nfirms in order to accelerate the imposition of effective market discipline.\n\n19\n\n\fWe advocate using as little government intervention and statutory modification as\npossible to restructure the largest institutions to a size that is effectively disciplined\nby both market and regulatory forces—so that every corporate entity is subject to a\nspeedy bankruptcy process and every banking entity is “too small to save.”\nThis would underscore to customers and creditors that a credible regime shift has\ntaken place, that all banking organizations are without subsidy and are governed by\nthe market discipline of creditors at risk of loss, and that the reign of TBTF\npolicies has truly ended.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nThe recent recession began in 2007 but cascaded into crisis in fall 2008, the effects of which we still grapple\nwith today.\n2\nSome examples of other thoughts on ending TBTF within the Federal Reserve System, include “Regulating\nLarge Financial Institutions,” speech by Jeremy C.

Sockin, Empirical & Thematic Perspectives, Citi Research, Dec. 10, 2012. These international\neconomists noted that “well-established results in the empirical literature have shown a special link between\nsmall firms and small banks. As such, this sustained and sizable decline in the role of small banks as providers\nof credit—reflecting the ongoing consolidation of the U.S. banking system—is very likely a factor contributing\nto the downtrend in the share of credit provided to small firms.” Further, the authors conclude that they\n“would be inclined to support public policies designed to ensure a level playing field between firms of various\nsizes and, in addition, measures to incentivize small-business creation and the allocation of credit to young\nfirms.” We at the Dallas Fed agree with this conclusion and promote competition across industries, including\nfinancial services.\n9\nHearing entitled “Who Is Too Big to Fail: Does Title II of the Dodd–Frank Act Enshrine Taxpayer-Funded\nBailouts?” Testimony by Professor David A.

Primary credit is a very short-term (usually overnight) loan to depository\ninstitutions in generally sound financial condition. Depository institutions not eligible for primary credit may\napply for secondary credit to meet short-term liquidity needs. Seasonal credit is extended to relatively small\ndepository institutions that have recurring intrayear fluctuations in funding needs.\n11\nThis would not prevent the Federal Reserve from serving its lender of last resort function in a liquidity crisis\nby lending to solvent companies with good collateral at a penalty interest rate on a temporary basis.\n12\nThis restructuring would be designed and implemented by the companies’ top management team within the\ntimeframe established by legislation and/or regulation.\n13\nRichard W.

Fisher\nThank you, Hugh (MacKinnon). I am honored to speak to this annual directors’ dinner of the\nC.D. Howe Institute and on the second day of Stephen Poloz becoming the governor of the Bank\nof Canada. Evan Siddall, his special adviser, is here tonight to keep an eye on me!\nThank You, Canada\nBefore getting to my formal remarks, I want to say something about Canada that has nothing to\ndo with monetary policy. On Sept. 11, 2001, I was on a flight, returning from the celebration of\nthe opening of the Jewish Museum in Berlin two days earlier.\nOn the morning of that fateful day, my flight was en route to New York City when we were\nsuddenly redirected to Toronto. We had been prevented from landing in New York, the pilot\nannounced, because of “severe headwinds.” We were told nothing more. After landing and\ndeplaning at Pearson and going through an extensive screening process, we were ushered into a\nbriefing room and only then learned what little was known at the time of the horrors that had\noccurred. Your government and our consular officials said that we were to remain in Toronto\nuntil order in America was restored, adding they were confident we would be well cared for as\nguests of a very compassionate Canada.\nSure enough, when we exited the airport, we found a line of cars driven by private citizens who\nhad spontaneously come to the airport to take any and all of their American brethren into their\nhomes and care for us while we waited anxiously to learn more of what had happened and why.\nFrom the home of my Canadian host, I somehow managed to get through by cell phone routed\nthrough Dallas to my wife, Nancy. She was hiding with our two youngest children in the\nbasement of our house in Washington, D.C. With the passage of time, it is easy to forget how\nchaotic and frightful that day was. It was unclear if all of Washington was under attack; rumors\nabounded that the Capitol and the White House were targeted. Our son had seen the images from\nFlight 77’s crash into the Pentagon and had run home from school with his frightened little sister\nin tow.\nI wanted to make sure my wife and children were safe. She reported they were and then asked if\nI was. I remember saying, “I am safe in the hands of our Canadian brothers and sisters.”\n\n1\n\n\fEvery chance I get, I thank Canadians for the caring and unconditional friendship you and your\ncountrymen showed the United States on that infamous day. For the rest of my life, Canada will\nhold a special place in my heart.\nIndeed, I love this country so much that I have even found it possible to forgive Sheila Copps for\nforcing me to listen to endless re-loops of songs by Gordon Lightfoot when I was deputy U.S.\ntrade rep and negotiated with her during her reign as minister of Canadian heritage!1\nThe Predicament of the U.S. Economy: Growth …\nNow, on to the status of the U.S. economy and monetary policy—of special interest to you\nbecause we account for three-quarters of Canada’s goods exports and a substantial amount of\nCanadian direct and portfolio investment.\nHere is a handy graphic we use at the Dallas Fed as a simple indicator of the current predicament\nof the U.S. economy:\n\nU.S. Economic Dashboard\n6\n\n6.5\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n1\n\n8\n\n5.5\n\n4.5\n\n9.5\n\n4 Unemployment 10\nrate\n5.5\n\n6 6.5 7\n\n5\n\n7.5\n\n8\n8.5\n\n4\n\n9\n\n3\n\nJunk-bond\nspread\n\n4.5\n\n1.78\n\n9.5\n\n-2.5\n\nPercent of jobs recovered\n7 0 . 4\n\n2.5\n\n4\n\n1.29\n\n-0.5\n-1\n\nTrimmed Mean\nPCE Inflation\n\n5.5\n6\n\n4.5\n5\n\nWarning lights\nEngine Unemp.

The unemployment rate gauge is not red\nbecause it declined to 7.5 percent in April. As indicated by the odometer box, we have traveled\nsome distance in job creation, even though we have not seen the job creation we might have\nhoped for in a typical recovery: 70.4 percent of jobs lost in the recent recession have been\nrecovered, up from about 50 percent only a year ago.\nThe warning light for the yield curve should be pink, if not yet red, for, if anything, it is robust to\nthe point of possibly becoming problematic in giving rise to speculative impulses. Despite the\nmost recent widening, junk-bond spreads are below 5 percent, as shown; nominal yields for even\nthe lowest-grade bonds (CCC-rated credit that is one notch above default) have fallen to below 7\npercent from double digits only a year ago. This is of interest because, according to Dealogic, we\nhave had $187 billion of junk bonds issued in the U.S. so far this year, a record.2 Further,\ncovenant-light lending is on a tear. And unless you’ve been living on another planet, you know\nwe have experienced a roaring bull market for equities. Thus the “oil lamp,” shown in the lower\nleft corner of the dashboard, depicts that the Fed has supplied plenty of lubrication for the engine\nof job creation.\nOver the four years since the recession ended in June 2009, GDP growth has averaged just 2.1\npercent, hewing to a narrow year-over-year range of 1.5 to 2.8 percent. It is noteworthy that the\nfraternity of U.S. professional economic forecasters has been consistently disappointed:\nForecasts made at the beginning of 2010, 2011 and 2012 all overpredicted growth. At the onset\nof this year, the median projection of professional forecasters called for 2.4 percent GDP growth\nfor all of 2013, and that, too, has been challenged by first-quarter data that came in below\nexpectations, raising fears of “déjà vu all over again.”\nHowever, the April jobs report, revisions of previous jobs data, and reports concerning consumer\nbehavior in May have put some spring back in economists’ steps despite the malaise in\nmanufacturing that has persisted for some time (long before yesterday’s Institute for Supply\nManagement manufacturing numbers were released). Initial claims for unemployment insurance\nare now back on a downward trend, retreating toward prerecession levels, and recent retail sales\nnumbers and indicators of consumer activity have surprised to the upside. This would appear to\nindicate that consumers may have digested delayed tax rebates and the increase in payroll taxes,\nand are relishing the benefits of lower gasoline, food and other prices. So the recovery presently\nappears to be strong enough to propel hopes that consumption will help employment growth\ngradually improve over the long term.\nI know audiences like this always want to be given some forecast of economic growth, especially\nby someone who they assume has some inside knowledge. I’ll stick my neck out in a moment,\nafter a brief discourse on where we are on the inflation front. But I ask that you treat any forecast\nfrom any source with what I like to call “Arrow’s Caveat.”\n3\n\n\fDuring World War II, future Nobel laureate Ken Arrow served as a weather officer in the Army\nAir Corps. He and his team were charged with producing month-ahead weather forecasts. Being\na disciplined analyst, Arrow reviewed the record of his predictions and, sure enough, confirmed\nstatistically that the corps’ forecasts were no more accurate than random rolls of dice. He asked\nto be relieved of this futile duty. Arrow’s recollection of the response from on high was\npriceless: “The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he\nneeds them for planning purposes.”\n… and the Outlook for Price Stability\nThe Fed’s most sacred duty is to see to the maintenance of price stability. Today, inflation is\nbenign. With a jobless rate still well north of 7 percent, a high rate of underemployment, labor\ncompensation rising at less than 2 percent per year, an outlook for abundant food crops and\nexpanding energy resources, and near-record profit margins among operating businesses, there is\nlittle likelihood of cost–push pressures in 2013. Slower growth around the globe is putting the\ndamper on demand–pull inflation. Provided the public remains confident in the Fed’s\ncommitment to price stability, anchored by the stated 2 percent long-term target of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC), the chances of inflation rearing its ugly head in 2013 are\npresently extremely low. I am sticking my neck out for the next six months!\nIndeed, the latest Trimmed Mean PCE inflation calculation done by the Dallas Fed for April\nposted a negative reading—minus 0.1 percent—for the first time since the raw data became\navailable in 1977, with 44 percent of the basket of 178 components measured declining in price.3\nThis is all subject to revision, but the drift is that the underlying inflation rate as we see it at the\nDallas Fed, as mentioned, is running at a pace of 1.3 percent.\nThe Efficacy of Current Monetary Policy\nAs a hawk in the aviary of policymakers, I have for some years now said that the issue of the\nmoment is not a meaningful threat to price stability. The issue is job creation. And the questions\nI keep raising at FOMC meetings regard our limited ability to affect it with our überaccommodative monetary policy.\nWith the Arrow Caveat in mind, my staff and I think there is a better-than-even chance that the\npresent GDP growth consensus forecast of 2.4 percent by professional economists may be\nunderestimating the underlying pace of growth. The housing market is in resurgence,\ncontributing significant impetus to the economy. The Fed’s senior loan officer survey indicates\nthat commercial banks are becoming more accommodative lenders, albeit remaining cautious.\nThe snapback in housing and the harnessing of cheap and abundant money by the business sector\nhave made for more manageable financial obligations. State and local governments, not just in\nmy home power-state of Texas but elsewhere in the nation, are on a better financial footing and\nno longer appear to be a major drag on growth. New technologies are providing for cheaper and\n4\n\n\fmore abundant energy. Consumers continue consuming, an important component that represents\n71 percent of the U.S. economy (compared with Canadian consumption accounting for 54\npercent of national output). Monetary policy has helped drive interest rates to historic lows and\nequity markets to historic highs; if anything, as noted, it may be giving rise to excessive\nspeculation and risk taking. In addition to the pricing of CCC debt and the surge in low-covenant\nlending, margin debt is climbing rapidly.\nEven if we at the Dallas Fed are right and the overall outlook for the economy is better than the\ncurrent dashboard or the conventional prognostications of economists, there exists a formidable\nbrake on growth. It was referred to point-blank in the last statement issued by the FOMC:\n“…fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.”4\nFiscal policy is inhibiting the transmission of monetary policy into robust job creation.\nAs this is an after-dinner speech and a little levity is always helpful in making a point at this time\nof night, here is my favorite spoof on the historical behavior of fiscal policy makers in\nWashington, D.C.:\nwww.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Df_6r_tZqGo\nThis would be funny if it were not so sad. The propensity of members of Congress has been to\nspend in excess of revenues to give pleasure to their constituents and garner their affection. They\njust didn’t get the memo that Jefferson wrote to Madison over two centuries ago: “We are ruined,\nSir, if we do not overrule the principles that ‘the more we owe, the more prosperous we shall be,’\n[and] ‘that a public debt furnishes the means of enterprise.’”5 The good news is that, some 200plus years later, the memo seems to have finally been received; there are numerous plans to rein\nin Congress’ spendthrift ways, and there have been improvements that have brightened the shortterm outlook for the level of federal debt.6 But, as yet, there has been little more than passive\naction.\nUntil the Congress and the president provide a clear road map to restoring fiscal rectitude,\neconomic growth will continue to be impeded by undue uncertainty about future tax rates, future\ngovernment purchases, future retiree benefits and all manner of factors that prevent the U.S.\nfrom achieving its long-run potential. Meanwhile, the divisive nature and petty posturing of\nthose who must determine the fiscal path of the nation are further undermining confidence,\nhindering the upward momentum needed for a full recovery and limiting the effectiveness of\nmonetary policy.\nHere is the rub: Even if the arguments of those who wish for greater fiscal stimulus prevail,\nexpansion in government purchases will have reduced effectiveness if it is thought that those\npurchases will be financed with higher future marginal tax rates, or the broadest tax of all, higher\n5\n\n\finflation. If you are an operating business, you have to discount this risk before adding\nsignificantly to payrolls and before undertaking capital expansion. In a similar vein, you need to\nconsider how the opposite approach of cutting government expenditures might impact your top\nline if the cuts are in areas that affect the markets you sell into. Add to that the enormous\nuncertainty about how health care reform will impact your cost structure. And add to that the fact\nthat community bankers—providers of the lifeblood of loans to small businesses, which are the\nimpetus for new job creation and economic rejuvenation—are hamstrung by burdensome\nregulations and fees imposed in response to the misbehavior of their too-big-to-fail brethren. If\nyou consider the economy from this perspective, you can see where brakes of the government’s\nown making are being applied, impeding the realization of our growth potential.\nDecision-making under conditions of uncertainty is always a challenge for businesses; decisionmaking in a thick fog of uncertainty is well-nigh impossible. It negates the power of\nhyperaccommodative monetary policy to propel our economic vessel forward. The restraining\ninfluence of rudderless fiscal policy is readily seen in the piling up of excess reserves on the\nbalance sheets of banks and in the coffers of operating businesses.\nI argue that the Fed has no hope of moving the economy to full employment, despite having\npulled out all the stops on the monetary front, unless our fiscal authorities get their act together.\nThose economic agents with the wherewithal to expand payrolls and put the American people\nback to work must have confidence that our fiscal authorities and regulation makers—the\nlegislative and the executive—will reorganize the tax code, spending habits and the regulatory\nregime so that the cheap and abundant money we at the Fed have made available to invest in jobcreating capital expansion in the United States is put to use. Until then, I argue that the Fed is, at\nbest, pushing on a string and, at worst, building up kindling for speculation and, eventually, a\nmassive shipboard fire of inflation.\nI note that in his speech of last Wednesday to the Economic Club of New York, former Fed\nChairman Paul Volcker highlighted that managing the supply of money and liquidity “to\naccommodate misguided fiscal policies, to deal with structural imbalances, [or] to square\ncontinuously the hypothetical circles of stability, growth and full employment” was a risky\nproposition for the Federal Reserve and warned that in attempting to do so, the Fed “will\ninevitably fall short.” He even referenced “pushing on a string.” And he added that, “The risks of\nencouraging speculative distortions and the inflationary potential—[note the word “potential,”\nnot “present instance”]—of the current approach plainly deserve attention.” I am in complete\nagreement with Mr. Volcker. I urge you to read his speech if you wish to understand my personal\nconcerns about the present course of monetary policy.7\n\n6\n\n\fA Shakespearean Scenario\nOnly time will reveal the efficacy of current policy and whether the risks that I and more\nexperienced observers like Paul Volcker fret over are as substantial as we surmise, or whether we\nhave made much ado about nothing.\nIf the Fed’s monetary policy were the stuff of Shakespearean drama with a prototypical five acts,\none might say we are in the last scene of the third act of a play titled “The Grand Experiment in\nModern Monetarism.” We will not know until the next two acts whether the play will end\nfelicitously or otherwise.\nHere is the CliffsNotes summary of the play thus far: The play opened with the great financial\ntempest of 2008–09, during which it appeared the ship of the mighty American economy would\nfounder. A humble, once unassuming but suddenly daring captain named Ben Bernanke took\nfirm control of the nation’s monetary helm in Act II, contriving innovative ways to keep the\neconomy afloat by jury-rigging monetary policy and adopting radical maneuvers. These efforts\nsucceeded in steering the ship of the economy away from the shoals of depression and deflation\nand into more tranquil waters.8\nAct III began with a recovering economy heading on a more promising course. But the headway\nbeing made was substandard, hindered by the flotsam and jetsam of fiscal incompetence and\nrising fears of a new storm brewing in Europe. In an effort to propel the economy forward at a\nbetter clip, the FOMC commanded that unprecedented amounts of monetary fuel be provisioned\nfor the financial system through large-scale asset purchases, colloquially known as QE2 and 3.\nThese purchases pumped almost $1 trillion into the stores of reserves of banks. As yet, however,\nthe banks have for the most part not shoveled that fuel into their boilers, lending only a small\nfraction of it to job-creating businesses and hoarding the remainder. Other members of the\nfinancial fleet, however, have been heartened by the turn of events, especially those who finance\nthemselves through the issuance of stocks and bonds rather than through bank loans. Yet they,\ntoo, have been reluctant to transform their renewed means into robust job creation. Thus, the\neconomy remains weaker than desired, and the ship of the economy is making less-than-desired\nheadway.\nThe plot now thickens. Act IV, just beginning, will involve the drama of introspection, with the\nFOMC evaluating the utility of its navigational tactics, and, perhaps, fine-tuning them, if not\naltering the course.\nNot until the final act will we know whether we have achieved the felicitous outcome of arriving\nat the desired port of an economy that grows sufficiently to bring about full employment without\ngiving rise to inflation. With Shakespeare, the most pleasant plays typically end in marriage. The\nhappy outcome to our economic predicament would entail a coupling of sensible fiscal policy\n\n7\n\n\fwith prudent monetary policy, carrying the American economy to new horizons, allowing the\nFed to emerge a hero.\nOne can envision less-pleasant outcomes, however, some of them tragic. If the fiscal\nauthorities—Congress and the president—are unable to provide tax, spending and regulatory\nincentives for job creators to use the cheap and abundant capital the FOMC has made available,\nthe economy might remain endlessly becalmed. Should the FOMC try to compensate for fiscal\nauthorities’ inability to act by provisioning still more monetary fuel, it may risk an explosion of\nspeculative excess, or worse: an eventual inflationary conflagration, the debasement of money\nand the ruination of our economy and lifestyle. Should this prove the outcome, the Fed will be\ntransmogrified from hero to villain.\nTo thicken the plot further, there is the uncertainty about whether command of the Fed will\nchange hands during Act IV or V—whether the skipper who set us on the present course will\nstay (which I have personally advocated in other speeches) or be replaced by someone who\nwishes to remain on the course he set or change it. And whether in commissioning a new captain\nof the Fed’s fleet, if that is what the playwright decides, the Congress will introduce new\ndramatic themes that might steer the plot in new directions. Even now, the chorus is chanting\nabout a Sound Dollar Act and other initiatives from behind the curtain.\nAll of which means that despite the mighty efforts of Captain Bernanke and his crew, present\ncompany included, we do not know how this play will end. Will “The Grand Experiment” prove\nan inspiring history, a tragedy or simply a comedy of errors? We will not know for some time.\nWe will not know until the curtain drops on Act V.\nI am tempted to end with a slightly adapted, trite reminder that “All the world’s economy is a\nstage and we policymakers are merely players upon it,” but I shan’t. Instead I’ll end by thanking\nyou for listening to me and, again, expressing my gratitude for the solidarity you and your fellow\nCanadians have shown the United States through thick and thin.\nAnd now, Hugh, time and patience permitting, I would be happy to avoid answering any\nquestions you and your colleagues might have.\n\n8\n\n\fNotes\n1\n\nAs deputy U.S. trade representative, I was dispatched to Ottawa by President Clinton to negotiate away the\nlegislation Minister Copps was proposing that would make it a criminal offense for U.S. companies to advertise in\nCanadian magazines, a clear violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n2\nSee “Bond Investors Break Pattern, Dump ‘Junk,’” by Katy Burne, Wall Street Journal, May 31, 2013.\n3\nFor the latest reading of the Dallas Fed’s alternative measure of core inflation, see\nwww.dallasfed.org/research/pce/index.cfm.\n4\nThe latest statement by the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors on the stance of monetary\npolicy can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20130501a.htm.\n5\nSee Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, by Jon Meacham, New York: Random House, 2012, p. 251.\n6\nSee “Our Debt Problems Are Still Far from Solved,” Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, May 15, 2013.\n7\nSee “Central Banking at a Crossroad,” speech by Paul A.

        "content": "“Never Let Your Brains Go to Your Head”\n(With Reference to “Babe” Fisher)\nRemarks before the Episcopal School of Dallas\n2013 Graduation Ceremony\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nMay 26, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\f“Never Let Your Brains Go to Your Head”\n(With Reference to “Babe” Fisher)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Kim MaGee (Interim Head of School). I am grateful to be your Commencement\nspeaker this afternoon.\nBefore I begin my formal remarks, I want the Class of 2013 to look around this auditorium. All\nof these people have come to celebrate your success. These are your parents and grandparents,\ncousins, uncles and aunts, your brothers and sisters, your friends, your teachers and coaches and\ncounselors. They have been by your side through joyful moments and less joyful ones. They\nhave encouraged you. They have believed in you. And they have occasionally badgered and\nhectored you and … driven you nuts. All to good effect. They are here with glad and happy\nhearts to celebrate your admission to the society of educated men and women. You will be\napplauded by them many times tonight. But I want you, the graduating class, to turn the table on\nthem and give them a round of applause. So stand up, put your hands together and give them a\ncheer. Thank them for loving you.\nNow, please be seated.\nThe only thing that rests between you and your finally receiving your Episcopal School of Dallas\ndiploma is … me. So I will make it snappy.\nBy now, you have taken enough English and writing courses to know the tongue-in-cheek\ndefinition of a good essay: It is a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised as your own!\nMost graduation speeches are no different. The standard routine for a commencement speaker is\nto access Google or dig through Bartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations to find\nsomething said by some sage that will grace a graduation ceremony with a lesson you can take\nwith you as you go off into this mysterious and challenging world.\nTo find something profound that I might pinch for your amusement, I pored over the sayings of\nthe great minds of the ages: Plato, Socrates, Mencius, Muhammad, St. Augustine, Voltaire,\nMartin Luther, Mother Teresa … Kim Kardashian, Lil Wayne.\nThe maxims put forward by the sages of the ages are inspiring, but as graduating seniors at ESD,\nyou already know them: be disciplined; be prepared; be loyal and thrifty and brave; don’t waste\nyour talents; question authority (but not the Head of School or your parents!); take risks; push the\nenvelope; be true to yourself, to your school, to your country; never promise more than you can\ndeliver; never compromise your integrity; never forget that you have been given talent to do\ngood; never, never, never, never give up the pursuit of excellence.\nThese are all wise maxims. But, truth be told, it would save time and expedite many a graduation\nceremony if its organizers would forgo a speaker and simply remind the graduating class to read\nand, throughout life, re-read the King James Bible or the Koran or Shakespeare or Confucius—\n2\n\n\fthe ultimate sources of almost every graduation speech I have ever read or listened to.\nFor example, it would tax the capacity of the most powerful search engine to pull up the\ncountless commencement speakers who have lifted and adapted variations of Shakespeare’s lines\nin King Henry VI, Part 2, Act 4, Scene VII—that “ignorance is the curse of God; Knowledge the\nwing wherewith we fly to heaven.”\nThe much-admired and brilliant dean of arts and humanities at Harvard University, Diana\nSorensen, defines a knowledgeable graduate taking wing as follows:\n“He or she is competent in making discerning judgments with tools derived from science,\nengineering, social science, the arts and humanities. He or she should be a persuasive speaker\nwho can articulate the reasons for his positions; who can write with clarity, elegance and\nconceptual power; an innovator who will take risks but first makes sure the limb they go out on\nis a sturdy one; a creative individual who has faced challenges posed by artistic production and\nexperimentation; a global citizen who can speak, read, write in at least a second language; and\nwho will learn what it takes to negotiate different world views emanating from different cultural\ntraditions, a tolerant yet rigorous thinker whose moral compass is guided by ethical reasoning.”\nNow, Class of 2013, I don’t want to put any pressure on you! But that pretty much summarizes\nthe skill set we all hope you have started to acquire at ESD and will now go on to hone in college\nand throughout your lives.\nHow might I, a lowly central banker whose musings are given to the arcana of economic and\nmonetary policy, possibly improve upon the wisdom of the ultimate sources? Not easily, so I dug\ndeep into my memory bank and called upon a source more erudite than the lessons of the Bible,\nthe Koran, Shakespeare or Confucius, and more insightful than Diana Sorensen—my mother,\nMagnhild Andersen Fisher, whom everybody called “Babe.”\n“Babe” Fisher was a stoic Norwegian. She was born and raised in an outpost in South Africa,\nlost her father when she was 4 in the flu pandemic of 1918 and grew up without the benefit of the\ntype of education you have received here at ESD. Yet she was a wise woman. She was a kind of\nfemale Nordic Yogi Berra: She dispensed exquisite pearls of wisdom to her three boys. One is\nespecially germane for this evening. My mother would say: “Never let your brains go to your\nhead.” The pun is horrific. But the message is profound: To achieve success you will need to\nkeep your superb education and your considerable talent in perspective. Brains and the gift of\ntalent are necessary, but they are insufficient for success in life.\nTime and again, in business and research labs and universities and government we see instances\nwhere men and women of towering intellect get far at first but ultimately snatch defeat from the\njaws of victory. They do so because they have forgotten to develop their emotional quotient with\nthe same devotion they applied to developing their intelligence quotient. My heartfelt advice to\nyou is to work as hard on expanding your EQ as you have on harnessing your IQ.\nYou all have great futures ahead of you. You will get there just as fast, and enjoy it much more,\nif you remember that a sound mind resides most comfortably in a sound, well-rounded person\n3\n\n\fand that a sound, well-rounded person has more than a superior education and brain. The whole\nperson is as important an achievement for those few who have been admitted to the “society of\neducated men and women” as is the achievement of intellectual excellence.\nWhich brings me to the last requirement for most all commencement orations—a smattering of\nLatin. Commencement speakers at great schools seem to delight in showing off their command\nof an ancient tongue. For example, a serious speaker might conclude this evening’s remarks with\nlabor omnia vincit—a stern reminder that labor conquers all things. It is true, indeed, that you\ncan’t rest on your laurels or your good family name or an ESD education or just plain good luck.\nYou have to work hard and sweat to succeed. And in doing so, you have to remember mens sana\nin corpore sano—a sound mind resides best in a sound body.\nBut that is way too ponderous. This is, after all, a festive day! So I will conclude with this:\n“Bubbus, sed possum explicarle; non sed possum comprehendere.”\nFor those of you unschooled in the language of the ancient Romans, that is Texas-ized Latin for\n“Bubba, I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”\nThis evening I have done my best to explain to the Class of 2013 that success comes to those\nwho best put their talents in context and who connect their substantial intellectual achievement to\nan equally developed emotional capacity. Those of us who lead cerebral lives must constantly\nstrive to elevate our “people skills” to a level equal to our intellectual skills. I can explain that to\nyou ad nauseam (another Latin phrase!). But you must come to understand it on your own.\nAnd if you do—if you go through your promising lives remembering that the “whole person is\nthe best person”—my guess is that someday one of you in the Class of 2013 will be standing at\nthis very podium giving the commencement speech to some future generation of graduates. And\nhaving the greatest pleasure a speaker can have: quoting your mom.\nCongratulations, God bless you and good luck!\nThank you.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nHouston, Texas\nMay 21, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\f“Never Let Your Brains Go to Your Head”\n(With Reference to “Babe” Fisher)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you for that kind introduction.\nIt is an honor to have been chosen as the commencement speaker for the Class of 2013 and to be\nintroduced by your young, dynamic headmaster, Mark Desjardins. The best definition I know of\na leader is summarized by what is known as the “John Paul Jones Creed.” The Father of the\nNavy defined the perfect officer as a “gentleman of liberal education, refined manners,\npunctilious courtesy and the nicest sense of personal honor.” Headmaster Desjardins has\nexhibited those exemplary attributes in the schools where he prepared for this all-important job\nof taking the helm at St. John’s in its 64th year. He has, in three short years, shown he is clearly\ndevoted to imparting them to the “whole child,” which St. John’s produces. You are lucky to\nhave him.\nBefore I begin my formal remarks, I want the Class of 2013 to look around this sanctuary. All of\nthese people have come to celebrate your success. These are your parents and grandparents,\ncousins, uncles and aunts, your brothers and sisters, your friends, your teachers and coaches and\ncounselors. They have been by your side through joyful moments and less joyful ones. They\nhave encouraged you. They have believed in you. And they have occasionally badgered and\nhectored you and … driven you nuts. All to good effect. They are here with glad and happy\nhearts to celebrate your admission to the society of educated men and women. You will be\napplauded by them many times tonight. But I want you, the graduating class, to turn the table on\nthem and give them a round of applause. So stand up, put your hands together and give them a\ncheer. Thank them for loving you.\nNow, please be seated.\nThe only thing that rests between you and your finally receiving your St. John’s School diploma\nis … me. So I will make it snappy.\nBy now, you have taken enough English and writing courses to know the tongue-in-cheek\ndefinition of a good essay: It is a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised as your own!\nMost graduation speeches are no different. The standard routine for a commencement speaker is\nto access Google or dig through Bartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations to find\nsomething said by some sage that will grace a graduation ceremony with a lesson you can take\nwith you as you go off into this mysterious and challenging world.\nTo find something profound that I might pinch for your amusement, I pored over the sayings of\nthe great minds of the ages: Plato, Socrates, Mencius, Muhammad, St. Augustine, Voltaire,\nMartin Luther, Mother Teresa … Kim Kardashian, Lil Wayne.\nThe maxims put forward by the sages of the ages are inspiring, but as graduating seniors at St.\n2\n\n\fJohn’s, you already know them: be disciplined; be prepared; be loyal and thrifty and brave; don’t\nwaste your talents; question authority (but not the Headmaster or your parents!); take risks; push\nthe envelope; be true to yourself, to your school, to your country; never promise more than you\ncan deliver; never compromise your integrity; never forget that you have been given talent to do\ngood; never, never, never, never give up the pursuit of excellence.\nThese are all wise maxims. But, truth be told, it would save time and expedite many a graduation\nceremony if its organizers would forgo a speaker and simply remind the graduating class to read\nand, throughout life, re-read the King James Bible or the Koran or Shakespeare or Confucius—\nthe ultimate sources of almost every graduation speech I have ever read or listened to.\nFor example, it would tax the capacity of the most powerful search engine to pull up the\ncountless commencement speakers who have lifted and adapted variations of Shakespeare’s lines\nin King Henry VI, Part 2, Act 4, Scene VII—that “ignorance is the curse of God; Knowledge the\nwing wherewith we fly to heaven.”\nThe much-admired and brilliant dean of arts and humanities at Harvard University, Diana\nSorensen, defines a knowledgeable graduate taking wing as follows:\n“He or she is competent is making discerning judgments with tools derived from science,\nengineering, social science, the arts and humanities. (He should be) a persuasive speaker who\ncan articulate the reasons for his positions; who can write with clarity, elegance and conceptual\npower; an innovator who will take risks but first makes sure the limb she goes out on is a sturdy\none; a creative individual who has faced challenges posed by artistic production and\nexperimentation; a global citizen who can speak, read, write in at least a second language; and\nwho will learn what it takes to negotiate different world views emanating from different cultural\ntraditions, a tolerant yet rigorous thinker whose moral compass is guided by ethical reasoning.”\nClass of 2013, I don’t want to put any pressure on you! But that pretty much summarizes the\nskill set we all hope you have started to acquire at St. John’s School and will now go on to hone\nin college and throughout your lives.\nHow might I, a lowly central banker whose musings are given to the arcana of economic and\nmonetary policy, possibly improve upon the wisdom of the ultimate sources? Not easily, so I dug\ndeep into my memory bank and called upon a source more erudite than the lessons of the Bible,\nthe Koran, Shakespeare or Confucius, and more insightful than Diana Sorensen—my mother,\nMagnhild Andersen Fisher, whom everybody called “Babe.”\n“Babe” Fisher was a stoic Norwegian. She was born and raised in an outpost in South Africa,\nlost her father when she was 4 in the flu pandemic of 1918 and grew up without the benefit of the\ntype of education you have received here at St. John’s. Yet she was a wise woman. She was a\nkind of female Nordic Yogi Berra: She dispensed exquisite pearls of wisdom to her three boys.\nOne is especially germane for this evening. My mother would say: “Never let your brains go to\nyour head.” The pun is horrific. But the message is profound: To achieve success you will need\nto keep your superb education and your considerable talent in perspective. Brains and the gift of\ntalent are necessary, but they are insufficient for success in life.\n3\n\n\fTime and again, in business and research labs and universities and government we see instances\nwhere men and women of towering intellect get far at first but ultimately snatch defeat from the\njaws of victory. They do so because they have forgotten to develop their emotional quotient with\nthe same devotion they applied to developing their intelligence quotient. My heartfelt advice to\nyou is to work as hard on expanding your EQ as you have on harnessing your IQ.\nYou all have great futures ahead of you. You will get there just as fast, and enjoy it much more,\nif you remember that a sound mind resides most comfortably in a sound, well-rounded person\nand that a sound, well-rounded person has more than a superior education and brain. The whole\nperson is as important an achievement for those few who have been admitted to the “society of\neducated men and women” as is the achievement of intellectual excellence. Again, remember the\ncreed of John Paul Jones. Being possessed of refined manners, punctilious courtesy and the\nnicest sense of personal honor is just as important to the success of a leader as having had a great\neducation.\nWhich brings me to the last requirement for most all commencement orations—a smattering of\nLatin. Commencement speakers at great schools seem to delight in showing off their command\nof an ancient tongue. For example, a serious speaker might conclude this evening’s remarks with\nlabor omnia vincit—a stern reminder that labor conquers all things. It is true, indeed, that you\ncan’t rest on your laurels or your good family name or a St. John’s education or just plain good\nluck. You have to work hard and sweat to succeed. And in doing so, you have to remember mens\nsana in corpore sano—a sound mind resides best in a sound body.\nBut that is way too ponderous. This is, after all, a festive day! So I will conclude with this:\n“Bubbus, sed possum explicarle; non sed possum comprehendere.”\nFor those of you unschooled in the language of the ancient Romans, that is Texas-ized Latin for\n“Bubba, I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”\nThis evening I have done my best to explain to the Class of 2013 that success comes to those\nwho best put their talents in context and who connect their substantial intellectual achievement to\nan equally developed emotional capacity. Those of us who lead cerebral lives must constantly\nstrive to elevate our “people skills” to a level equal to our intellectual skills. I can explain that to\nyou ad nauseam. But you must come to understand it on your own.\nAnd if you do—if you go through your promising lives remembering that the “whole person is\nthe best person”—my guess is that someday one of you in the Class of 2013 will be standing at\nthis very podium giving the commencement speech to some future generation of graduates. And\nhaving the greatest pleasure a speaker can have: quoting your mom.\nCongratulations, God bless you and good luck!\nThank you.\n\n4\n\n\f"

        "content": "Fiscal Policy. Oy!\n(With Reference to Ben Bernanke, Ken Arrow, Thomas Jefferson,\nWilliam Shakespeare and the Oracle of Omaha)\n\nRemarks at the 2013 National Association for Business Economics Conference\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nHouston, Texas\nMay 16, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fFiscal Policy. Oy!\n(With Reference to Ben Bernanke, Ken Arrow, Thomas Jefferson,\nWilliam Shakespeare and the Oracle of Omaha)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Ken (Simonson). I am delighted that the National Association for Business\nEconomics (NABE) has chosen the Dallas Fed’s Houston Branch as the venue for this meeting\non the oil and gas boom as a possible engine for “Reigniting the Economy.” As you will shortly\nhear from my Dallas Fed colleague, Mine Yücel; my wise old colleague from my days at\nTreasury in the 1970s, Phil Verleger; the incoming chairman of our San Antonio Branch, Curt\nAnastasio; and others, this is an intriguing proposition. The technical and entrepreneurial genius\nof Houston and Texas is playing a key role in unlocking our nation’s energy potential. Indeed,\nthere are many here in Texas and abroad—in places as distant as Illinois, Michigan and New\nYork—who argue that reigniting their local economies and the nation’s economy calls for more\n“Texification,” above and beyond the frontiers of energy.\nBut I am not here today to discuss oil and gas or engage in “Texas brag.” I have been asked to\nprovide a broader perspective on the nation’s economic and monetary policy.\nCurrent Predicament of Monetary Policy: A Grand Experiment\nI’ll begin with a summary of the current predicament of monetary policy.\nThe Federal Reserve has undertaken a grand experiment to reignite the economy through\nunprecedented monetary accommodation. We cut to zero the base rate that anchors the yield\ncurve and have pursued a policy aimed at driving rates throughout the curve to historic lows by\nbuying Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Our portfolio totals about $3 trillion,\nwhich we have recently been expanding at a rate of $85 billion per month.\nHere is a picture of the domestic securities of the current System Open Market Account (SOMA)\nportfolio.1\n\n1\n\n\fSOMA Domestic Securities Holdings\nBillions of dollars\n3,200\n\nAgencyMBS\nMBS\nAgency\n\nAgencydebt\ndebt\nAgency\n\nTreasurysecurities\nsecurities>3\n> 3years\nTreasury\n\nTreasurysecurities\nsecurities<3\n< 3years\nTreasury\n\n2,800\n2,400\n2,000\n1,600\n1,200\n800\n400\n0\n'09\n\n'10\n\n'11\n\n'12\n\n'13\n\nNOTE: Weekly averages. Includes unsettled holdings.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe sea change in the balance sheet in recent years is immediately visible: In sharp contrast to\nthe past, we now hold almost no Treasury notes of less than three years’ duration—the dark blue\nspace. We have purchased in the secondary markets some $1.7 trillion in longer-term\nTreasuries—the light blue area—and, as denoted by the green, more than $1.1 trillion of\nsecurities backed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (commonly known as Fannie\nMae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) and the Government National\nMortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). We live in an age of big numbers when I can say, “Ignore\nthe purple space, for it is only $70 billion in remaining Fannie and Freddie debentures, aka\n‘agency debt.’” Before the crisis, when we didn’t have any agency debt, $70 billion would have\nrepresented 8 percent of our balance sheet.\nAs to the duration of these purchases, here is a picture from year-end 2012:\n\n2\n\n\fAverage Duration of SOMA Holdings\nYears\n9\n8\n\nTotal SOMA\n\nTreasury securities\n\nAgency MBS\n\nAgency debt\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n'09\n\n'10\n\n'11\n\n'12\n\nNOTE: Reported monthly through year-end 2012.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nIncluding securities purchased since then, the total SOMA portfolio has an average duration of\nseven years, with Treasury securities at eight years and MBS having risen to four years.\n\n3\n\n\fAccording to dealers’ forecasts at year-end and as of March, the probability distribution of the\nexpected size of the SOMA portfolio is as follows:\n\nProbability Distribution of Year-End 2014\nSOMA Portfolio Forecasts\nPercent of respondents\n60\n\nDecember\n2012\nSurvey\n(post-FOMC)\nDecember\n2012\nsurvey\n(post-FOMC)\nMarch\nSurvey\nMarch2013\n2013\nsurvey\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n< 2,500\n\n2,500–3,000\n\n3,000–3,500\n\n3,500–4,000\n\n4,000–4,500\n\n4,500–5,000\n\n> 5,000\n\nPar amount (billions of dollars)\nNOTE: Forecasts through 2014.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nSo, you now have a snapshot of where we are. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nhas cut the short-term rate to zero. Being “zero bound,” we instructed our traders to embark on a\nbuying spree of Treasuries and MBS, and they have done so, ballooning our balance sheet from\nits precrisis level of less than $900 billion to about $3.3 trillion. Presently, the committee is\nadding to its holdings at a rate of $85 billion in longer-term securities each month, in addition to\nreinvesting principal payments from holdings of agency MBS and agency debt securities into\nagency MBS. And the predominant sentiment of the “market,” as measured by our dealer\nsurveys, presently posits that we will build our holdings further, to between $3.5 trillion and\npossibly $5 trillion by the end of 2014.\nThe Economy’s Dashboard\nAs to the status of the economy, here is the dashboard our Research Director (and former NABE\nPresident) Harvey Rosenblum uses as a simple graphic to describe the current economic\npredicament:\n\n4\n\n\fU.S. Economic Dashboard\n6.5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\n5.5\n\n0.5\n\n8.5\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n2.5\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\nUnemployment\nrate\n\n5.5\n\n6 6.5\n\n7\n\n5\n\n10\n\n7.5\n\n8\n8.5\n\n4\n\n9\n\n4.65\n\n3.5\n3\n\nJunk-bond\nspread\n\n1.80\n\n-1.5\n\n4.5\n\n9.5\n\n0\n\n4.5\n\n-1\n\n-2.5\n\nPercent of jobs recovered\n7 0 . 4\n\n2.5\n\n4\n\n1.43\n-1\n\nTrimmed Mean\nPCE Inflation\n\n5.5\n6\n\n4.5\n5\n\nWarning\nEngine Unemp.

The dashboard also indicates that at quarter’s end, we were\ncruising along at near stall speed—note the “Engine stall” red warning light. The unemploymentrate gauge is not red because it declined to 7.5 percent in April. And, as indicated by the\nodometer box, we have traveled some distance in job creation, even though we have not seen the\njob creation we might have hoped for in a typical recovery: 70.4 percent of jobs lost in the recent\nrecession have been recovered, up from about 50 percent only a year ago. The indicator for the\nyield curve, if anything, is robust. Junk-bond spreads are below 5 percent; nominal yields for\neven the lowest-grade bonds (CCC-rated credit that is one notch above default) have fallen to\nbelow 7 percent from double digits only a year ago. Further, covenant-light lending is on a tear.\nThe “oil gauge” indicates the Fed has supplied plenty of lubrication for the engine of job\ncreation.\nProfessional Forecasters Have Been Disappointed Thus Far…\nOver the four years since the recession ended in June 2009, GDP growth has averaged just 2.1\npercent, hewing to a narrow year-over-year range of 1.5 to 2.8 percent. It is noteworthy that the\nfraternity of professional economic forecasters has been consistently disappointed: Forecasts\nmade at the beginning of 2010, 2011 and 2012 all overpredicted growth. At the onset of this\nyear, the median forecast for 2013 called for 2.4 percent GDP growth, and that, too, has been\nchallenged by first-quarter data that came in below expectations, raising fears of “déjà vu all over\nagain.”\n5\n\n\f…But April Could Signal Improvement\nHowever, the April jobs report and revisions of previous jobs data have put some spring back in\neconomists’ steps. Initial claims for unemployment insurance are now back on a downward\ntrend, retreating to prerecession levels, and Monday’s retail sales numbers were a nice upside\nsurprise. This indicates that consumers may have digested delayed tax rebates and the increase in\npayroll taxes, and are reaping the benefits of lower gasoline and food prices. So the recovery\npresently appears to be strong enough to propel hopes that employment growth will continue\nimproving over the near term.\nAs to Inflation …\nOf course, the Fed’s most sacred duty is to see to the maintenance of price stability. Today,\ninflation is benign. With a jobless rate still well north of 7 percent, labor compensation rising at\nless than 2 percent per year, an outlook for abundant food crops and expanding energy sources,\nand near-record profit margins among operating businesses, there appears to be little risk that we\nwill see significant cost-push pressures in 2013. In addition, slower growth around the globe is\nputting the damper on demand-pull inflation. Provided that the public remains confident in the\nFed’s commitment to long-run price stability, anchored by the FOMC’s stated commitment to a\ntarget of 2 percent, my reading of the entrails of the Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate currently\nindicates we will likely end this year somewhere between 1.5 percent and our 2 percent long-run\ngoal.2\nAs a hawk in the aviary of policymakers, I have for some years now said that the issue at present\nis not a meaningful threat to price stability in the immediate future. The issue is job creation.\nAnd the questions I keep raising at FOMC meetings regard our ability to affect it.\nTime to Reset the Fed’s Sails?\nHaving spent the happiest of my formative years preparing for and attending the U.S. Naval\nAcademy, then paying my way through Harvard sailing oceangoing yachts as a hired hand, I am\ngiven to seafaring analogies. Here is how I would summarize our most recent journey:\nThe current chairman, Ben Bernanke, took the wheel at the Fed just as we sailed into a tempest\nthat nearly capsized our economy. He and his able crew kept the ship of the economy from\nfloundering and navigated it past the rocks of depression and deflation. The Bernanke-led FOMC\nsteered clear of the shoals of economic collapse by jury-rigging the vessel of monetary policy in\nan unconventional and unprecedented manner. Now the ship of the Fed is in more benign waters\nand is sailing forward. The question before us is this: Are we moving forward at sufficient speed\nto allow the Fed to reset our rigging and our sails, eventually going back to a more conventional\nconfiguration?\n\n6\n\n\fThe answer lies in the economic outlook. I am wary of giving pinpoint forecasts of economic\ngrowth. As I mentioned earlier, professional forecasters, including the very capable staff of the\nFederal Reserve, have fallen short on this front, time and again, during the recovery and on\nnumerous occasions before that. I am always mindful of the memorable comments of Ken\nArrow. You may recall them:\nDuring World War II, Arrow served as a weather officer in the Army Air Corps. He and his team\nwere charged with producing month-ahead weather forecasts. Being a disciplined analyst, Arrow\nreviewed the record of his predictions and, sure enough, confirmed statistically that the corps’\nforecasts were no more accurate than random rolls of dice. He asked to be relieved of this futile\nduty. Arrow’s recollection of the response from on high was priceless: “The commanding\ngeneral is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning\npurposes.”\nWith that caveat in mind, my staff and I think there is a better-than-even chance that the present\nGDP growth consensus forecast of 2.4 percent by professional economists may be\nunderestimating the underlying pace of growth. The housing market is in resurgence,\ncontributing significant impetus to the economy. The Fed’s senior loan officer surveys indicate\nthat commercial banks are becoming more accommodative lenders, albeit remaining cautious.3\nThe snapback in housing and the harnessing of cheap and abundant money by the business sector\nhave made for more manageable financial obligations. State and local governments, not just in\nTexas but elsewhere in the nation, are on a better financial footing and no longer appear to be a\nmajor drag on growth. As this audience knows better than anybody, new technologies are\nproviding for cheaper and more abundant energy. Consumers continue consuming. Monetary\npolicy is hyper-accommodative, driving interest rates to historic lows and equity markets to\nhistoric highs; if anything, it may be giving rise to excessive speculation and risk taking. (In\naddition to the pricing of CCC debt and the surge in low-covenant lending, margin debt is\nclimbing rapidly.)\nI have advocated that we begin to reef in the sails, beginning with our MBS purchase program.\nIn my view, the housing market is on a self-sustaining path and does not need the same impetus\nwe have been giving it. In recent months, under its balance-sheet expansion program, the Fed has\nbought about 50 percent of gross issuance of agency MBS, partly to replace prepayments of our\nMBS holdings. When refinancing activity eventually shifts down, the Fed could soon be buying\nup to 100 percent of MBS issuance if the current purchase program continues. I believe buying\nsuch a high share of gross issuance in any security is not only excessive, but also potentially\ndisruptive to the proper functioning of the MBS market. I have never been comfortable with our\ninvesting in anything but Treasuries, being wary of a central bank engaging in credit allocation\nand favoring specific sectors of the economy. It brings to mind the fears Thomas Jefferson and\nJames Madison had about the slippery slope of Alexander Hamilton’s First Bank of the United\nStates, recently recalled in Jon Meacham’s brilliant book on Jefferson: “They feared that the\n7\n\n\fHamiltonian program would enable financial speculators to benefit from commercial transactions\nmade possible by government funds.”4\nYet I admit that given the crucial role housing plays in our economy and the dire straits the\nhousing market was in at the time, I did hold my nose and vote for the first tranche of MBS\npurchases. I believe that initiative was helpful in jump-starting the housing market. But now I\nbelieve the efficacy of continued purchases is questionable. And I consider holding $1.1 trillion\nand counting of MBS as a possible impairment to our ability to maneuver our balance sheet with\nthe nimbleness and alacrity we might need. I think we can rightly declare victory on the housing\nfront and reef in (or dial back) our purchases, with the aim of eliminating them entirely as the\nyear wears on.\nEnter Fiscal Policy. Oy!\nEven if we at the Dallas Fed are right and the overall outlook for the economy is better than the\ncurrent dashboard or the conventional prognostications of economists, there exists a formidable\nbrake on growth. It was referred to point-blank in the last statement issued by the FOMC:\n“…fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.”5\nFiscal policy is inhibiting the transmission of monetary policy into robust job creation.\nAs it is early in the morning and a little levity is always helpful in making a point, here is my\nfavorite spoof on the historical behavior of fiscal policy makers:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Df_6r_tZqGo\nThis would be funny if it were not so sad. The propensity of members of Congress has been to\nspend in excess of revenues to give pleasure to their constituents and garner their affection. They\njust didn’t get the memo that Jefferson wrote to Madison: “We are ruined, Sir, if we do not\noverrule the principles that ‘the more we owe, the more prosperous we shall be,’ [and] ‘that a\npublic debt furnishes the means of enterprise.’”6 The good news is that, some 200-plus years\nlater, the memo seems to have finally been received; there are numerous plans to rein in\nCongress’ spendthrift ways and there have been improvements that have brightened the shortterm outlook for the level of federal debt.7 But, as yet, there has been little more than passive\naction. Until the Congress and the president provide a clear road map as to how fiscal rectitude\nwill be implemented, this lack of credible details for limiting the debt-to-GDP ratio and\nreengineering fiscal policy to stimulate rather than constrain growth is creating undue uncertainty\nabout future tax rates, future government purchases, future retiree benefits and all manner of\nfactors that impact employment and economic growth. Meanwhile, the divisive nature and petty\nposturing of those who must determine the fiscal path of the nation is further undermining\nconfidence and limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\n8\n\n\fHere is the rub: Even if the arguments of those who wish for greater fiscal stimulus prevail,\nexpansion in government purchases will have reduced effectiveness if it is thought that those\npurchases will be financed with higher future marginal tax rates. If you are an operating\nbusiness, you have to discount this risk before adding significantly to payrolls and before\nundertaking capital expansion. In a similar vein, you need to consider how the opposite approach\nof cutting government expenditures might impact your top line if the cuts are in areas that affect\nthe markets you sell into. Add to that the enormous uncertainty about how health care reform\nwill impact your cost structure. And add to that the fact that community bankers—providers of\nthe lifeblood of loans to small businesses, which are the impetus for new job creation and\neconomic rejuvenation—are hamstrung by burdensome regulations and fees imposed in response\nto the misbehavior of their too-big-to-fail brethren. If you consider the economy from this\nperspective, you can see where brakes of our own government’s making are being applied to a\nrealization of our growth potential.\nDecisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty is always a challenge for businesses;\ndecisionmaking in a thick fog of uncertainty is well-nigh impossible. It negates the power of\nhyper-accommodative monetary policy to propel our economic vessel forward. The restraining\ninfluence of rudderless fiscal policy is readily seen in the piling up of excess reserves on the\nbalance sheets of banks and in the coffers of operating businesses.\nI argue that the Fed has no hope of moving the economy to full employment unless our fiscal\nauthorities get their act together. Those economic agents with the wherewithal to expand payrolls\nand put the American people back to work must have confidence that our fiscal authorities and\nregulation makers—the legislative and the executive—will reorganize the tax code, spending\nhabits and the regulatory regime so that the cheap and abundant money we at the Fed have made\navailable to invest in job-creating capital expansion in the United States is put to use. Until then,\nI argue that the Fed is, at best, pushing on a string and, at worst, building up kindling for a\nmassive shipboard fire of eventual inflation.\nAll the World’s a Stage (and All the Policymakers Merely Players)\nIt is thus as-yet unclear whether the benefits of the strategy the Fed has taken outweigh its costs.\nOnly time will tell. The Federal Open Market Committee will have to wait for the verdict of\nhistory. Scholars know that Shakespearian plays all have five acts. I would suggest that we are\nbut in the third act of a play—we had the tempest in Act 1; the jury-rigging of monetary policy\nand radical maneuvers by the Fed to save the ship in Act 2; and in the present act, we are back on\ncourse but somewhat becalmed, sailing at less-than-desired cruising speed even as we have\ncranked up an auxiliary motor of large-scale asset purchases. Act 4 will involve the travails and\nchallenges of adjusting our policy course, fine-tuning the motor and rearranging the rigging. And\nnot until the final act will we know whether we have achieved the felicitous outcome that is the\nhallmark of most romantic plays, or whether the melancholy that defines a tragedy awaits us.\n\n9\n\n\fThe romantic outcome ends, as most all Shakespearian comedies do, in a marriage—in this case,\na marriage of sensible fiscal and monetary policy that lifts employment and carries the American\neconomy to new heights.\nThe tragic outcome is one in which the fiscal authorities—the Congress and the president—are\nunable to provide incentives for risk takers to make use of the cheap and abundant capital the\nFed has made available, and the play ends in a debasement of the central bank and the ruination\nof our economy and lifestyle.\nThe former outcome is that envisioned by the theoreticians that lead the Fed: According to this\nplot, by driving rates to historical lows along the entire length of the yield curve, investors will\nrebalance their portfolios and reach out to riskier assets, providing the financial wherewithal for\nbusinesses to increase capital expenditures and reengage workers, expand payrolls and\nregenerate consumption. Rising prices of bonds, stocks and other financial instruments will\nbolster consumer confidence. The CliffsNotes account of this play has the widely heralded\n“wealth effect” paving the way for economic expansion, thus saving the day.\nThe latter outcome posits that the wealth effect is limited, for two possible reasons. One is that\nour continued purchases of Treasuries are having decreasing effects on private borrowing costs,\ngiven how low long-term Treasury rates already are. Another is that the uncertainty resulting\nfrom fiscal tomfoolery is a serious obstacle to restoring full employment. Until job creators are\nproperly incentivized by fiscal and regulatory policy to harness the cheap and abundant money\nwe at the Fed have engineered, these funds will predominantly benefit those with the means to\nspeculate, tilling the fields of finance for returns that are enabled by historically low rates but do\nnot readily result in job expansion. Cheap capital inures to the benefit of the Warren Buffetts,\nwho can discount lower hurdle rates to achieve their investors’ expectations, accumulating\nholdings without necessarily expanding employment or the wealth of the overall economy.\nI hold no vendetta against the Buffetts of the world, having once been a junior member of that\nclass—I made a nice living during the 1980s and ’90s buying operating assets for nickels and\ndimes and turning them into dollars by rationalizing and downsizing them. And like legions of\nothers, I have for countless years read the Oracle of Omaha’s annual statement with admiration\nfor his prowess as an investor and profit-seeker. But my role as a policymaker is different from\nmy previous role as an investor: I have sworn fealty to a dual mandate of conducting monetary\npolicy so as to maintain price stability AND create the monetary conditions for full employment\nand prosperity for all, not just for the rich and the quick. This, I fear, we will fail to do unless\nCongress and the president develop and deliver on a strategy that complements ours at the Fed.\nThis may be a sour ending to a somber song, but, after all, economics is not called “the dismal\nscience” for nothing. Have a nice day!\n\n10\n\n\fNow, in the best tradition of central bankers, I would be happy to avoid answering your\nquestions.\nNotes\n1\n\nFor more information, see the New York Fed’s website at\nwww.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma/sysopen_accholdings.html or the 2012 SOMA annual report at\nwww.newyorkfed.org/markets/omo/omo2012.pdf.\n2\nFor the latest reading of the Dallas Fed’s alternative measure of core inflation, see\nwww.dallasfed.org/research/pce/index.cfm.\n3\nFor more information regarding the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, see\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SnLoanSurvey/201305/default.htm.\n4\nSee Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, by Jon Meacham, New York: Random House, 2012, p. 249.\n5\nThe latest statement by the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors on the stance\nof monetary policy can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20130501a.htm.\n6\nSee note 4, p. 251.\n7\nSee “Our Debt Problems Are Still Far from Solved,” Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, May\n15, 2013.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nEl Paso, Texas\nApril 10, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\f‘Oil and Gas, Blondes and Over-Accessorized Brunettes,\nand Ruthless, Hard-Drinking Cowboys’\n(With Reference to Sheikh Zayed, Diana Natalicio,\nMy Nephew Charles and President Peña Nieto)\nRichard W. Fisher\nI so appreciate being here at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), my first outing since\nreturning from a trip to the United Arab Emirates. The founder of the Emirates—a collection of\nformer “Trucial States” along the lower coast of the Arabian Sea—was Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan\nAl Nahyan, a wise man who had no formal education but knew of its enormous value. He said,\n“Education is a lantern which lights the dark alleys of ignorance.”1\nI mention this because I cannot think of an educator who embodies this practical dictum better\nthan Diana Natalicio. President Natalicio is a bright, shining lantern in the world of education.\nActually, that’s an understatement: She is a klieg light! We are blessed to have her lead UTEP\nand move Texas and the nation forward on the frontiers of higher education. I am tremendously\nhonored to be introduced by her. Thank you, Diana.\nI am going to depart from my usual format today and rely heavily on slides—slides that provide\na factual basis for what is going to be a dose of “Texas brag.” With its branches in El Paso, San\nAntonio and Houston, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas—the Federal Reserve’s Eleventh\nDistrict—covers about 27 million people over 360,000 square miles stretching from northern\nLouisiana to southern New Mexico. Over 96 percent of the economic output of the district comes\nfrom Texas.\nI find that when I speak about my district in foreign lands—say, in New York or Washington,\nD.C.—there is a stereotypical reaction not unlike the image projected by the TV show Dallas.\n“Of course you are doing well,” they say. “You are rich in oil and gas, blondes and overaccessorized brunettes, and ruthless, hard-drinking cowboys.” Today, I want to set the record\nstraight.\nPrices Are Presently Stable; Employment Is Far From Optimal; the Efficacy of\nQuantitative Easing Is as Yet Unclear\nThe road to dignity is through work: Jobs provide the means for economic advancement. As the\nnation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve is tasked with maintaining price stability—a common\nmonetary policy goal of all responsible central banks. But under the laws created by Congress\nthat govern our franchise and allow it to operate independently, the Fed works under a dual\nmandate—to conduct monetary policy that keeps prices from inflating or deflating and to\nachieve full employment.\nAt the moment, and for the foreseeable future, neither inflation nor deflation appears on the\nforecast horizon. However, the longer-term inflationary consequences of the massive quantitative\neasing programs we have undertaken—programs I have opposed in our Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) meetings but that have been approved by the majority of the committee—\n1\n\n\fare as yet unclear. Those aftereffects will depend on how artful the committee will be in\nunwinding that accommodation on a timely basis. Indeed, one of the signal achievements of\nFederal Reserve policy under Ben Bernanke’s leadership is to have formalized a long-term\ninflation target of 2 percent, something the FOMC had never before distinctly declared.\nPresently, the 12-month inflation rate is 1.6 percent, according to our calculation at the Dallas\nFed, where we do a “trimmed mean” analysis of 178 items consumers use, including guns and\nbeer (hopefully not enjoyed simultaneously) and the cost of gasoline, food, getting your hair cut\nor your shoes repaired, or buying an electronic device. Given that the trimmed mean analysis has\nproven to be an excellent rule-of-thumb predictor of headline inflation one year forward, we can\nsay with some degree of confidence that, at present, we are keeping inflation at or below our 2\npercent target.\nEmployment, however, is not at a comfortable level. Pick up any newspaper or go to any news\nwebsite or broadcast medium and you will read or hear of the still-too-high unemployment rate\nthat bedevils our economy. Monetary policy acts with a lag, including unorthodox monetary\npolicy as it is now being conducted. It would appear from some studies and from anecdotal\nevidence that companies are starting to use the copious cheap money they have access to for\ninvesting in capital projects and employing increasing amounts of workers.2 But it is not yet clear\nthat we will achieve a justifiable bang for the trillions of bucks the Fed has flooded the economy\nwith. Only time will tell if the efficacy of quantitative easing we have undertaken was justifiable\nin regard to job creation and delivering on the second component of our dual mandate.\nYet many things do emerge when you examine the entrails of employment data from across the\ncountry. One thing is that you learn a lot about Texas, which is the focus of my remarks today.\n‘If You Pull Texas Out of the Puzzle, the Country Falls Down’\nFor the past 22 years, Texas has outgrown the country by a factor of more than 2-to-1. Here is a\nslide that shows the percentage increase in jobs created by several large states and for the U.S. as\na whole since 1990:\n\n2\n\n\fTotal Nonagricultural Employment\nSince 1990 in Selected States\nIndex, January 1990 = 100\n170\nTexas\n\n160\n150\n\nFlorida\n\n140\n130\n\nU.S.\n120\n\nCalifornia\nIllinois\n\n110\n100\n\nMichigan\n\nNew York\n\n90\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nAnd here is a look at the rate of job creation for those same states and the U.S. as a whole since\n2000:\n\nTotal Nonagricultural Employment\nSince 2000 in Selected States\nIndex, January 2000 = 100\n125\nTexas\n\n120\n115\n110\n\nFlorida\n\n105\n\nNew York\nU.S.\nCalifornia\n\n100\n95\n\nIllinois\n\n90\n\nMichigan\n\n85\n80\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nWe were one of the last states to go into the recent recession and one of the first to come out. In\nterms of jobs, as of now, 10 states have come back to or have exceeded employment levels that\n\n3\n\n\fprevailed before the crisis: Alaska, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, North Dakota,\nOklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.\nThe Federal Reserve has no index that measures the number of blondes or ruthless cowboys in\nTexas, but we can account for the influence of oil and gas on our state’s welfare: Oil and gas\nextraction and mining support directly accounts for 2.4 percent of our workforce—two-pointfour percent. And the energy sector’s total contribution to our state’s gross domestic product\n(GDP) is roughly 10 percent. So yes, the foreigners are correct: We have a strong energy sector\nin Texas. We are the No. 1 producer of oil and gas in the nation. We produce more oil than\nVenezuela and more natural gas than Canada. On net, high energy prices do, indeed, benefit\nTexans.\nBut look at this slide of the number of jobs created by sector in 2012:\n\n2012 Employment Growth in Texas\nThousands of jobs\n80\n70\n\nTotal number of jobs created in 2012 = 335,500\n74.2\n\n62\n\n60\n\n52.4\n\n50\n41\n40\n27\n\n30\n18.4\n\n20\n\n22.1\n16.2\n\n9.7\n\n10\n0\n-10\n\nTrade,\ntransp &\nutilities\n(20%)\n\nProf. &\nGovernment Educational & business\nservices\nhealth\nservices\n(16.3%)\n(13.1%)\n(13.4%)\n\n-0.3\nOil & gas\nLeisure & Manufacturing Financial Construction extraction and\nInformation\nactivities\nmining\nhospitality\n(5.4%)\n(7.9%)\n(1.8%)\n(6%)\nsupport (2.4%)\n(10.1%)\n\nNOTES: Categories are North American Industry Classification System supersectors. Data seasonally adjusted.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nOil and gas and mining and their support services accounted for 22,100, or less than 7 percent, of\nthe 335,500 jobs created in Texas last year. Professional and business services accounted for\n74,200; trade, transportation and utilities 62,000; leisure and hospitality 52,400; educational and\nhealth services 41,000; and construction 27,000. Each of these sectors created more jobs than the\nenergy sector. Of course, the oil and gas sector has large multipliers, so the overall economic\nimpact is greater than just these 22,100 jobs. The University of Texas at San Antonio—your\nsister organization—estimates that the Eagle Ford Shale generated over $61 billion in economic\nimpact in 2012. As this chart shows, however, ours is a diversified economy, creating jobs across\nthe spectrum.\n“But these jobs are all low paying,” our uninformed friends say. And to that I respond: “You are\nright. We create more low-paying jobs in Texas than anybody else. Yet look at this breakdown of\n\n4\n\n\fjob creation by income quartile for Texas versus the United States minus Texas for the past 10plus years”:\n\nJob Growth by Wage Quartile,\n2001-12\nPercent change\n30\n\n26.5\n24.2\n\n25\nTexas\n\n20\n15\n\nU.S. minus Texas\n14.1\n\n12.6\n\n10\n5\n\n5.5\n\n5.1\n0.1\n\n0\n-5\n\n-6.0\n-10\nLowest wage quartile\n\nLower-middle wage\nquartile\n\nUpper-middle wage\nquartile\n\nHighest wage quartile\n\nNOTES: Calculations include workers over age 15 with positive wages.

But we also created far more high-paying jobs. Most\nimportantly, while the United States has seen job destruction in the two middle-income quartiles,\nTexas has created jobs for those vital middle-income workers, too.\nThe bottom line—we have experienced growth across all sectors and in all income categories.\nAnd it continues: In February, job growth in Texas was an annualized 6.9 percent. Year to date,\nconstruction, trade and transportation, and professional and business services have led the pack\nin what we believe will be another year of employment growth that, knock on wood, will\napproach 3 percent.\nHere are some other facts that help round out the economic picture of our state.\nOur banks are more profitable than those in the rest of the nation …\n\n5\n\n\fShare of Unprofitable Banks in\nthe U.S. and 11th District\nPercent of banks reporting net loss\n35\n31\n30\nU.S.\n\n11th District\n\n25\n\n22\n\n20\n15\n\n14\n\n15\n\n12\n10\n\n10\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n0\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nIn the housing sector, we have fewer underwater mortgages …\n\nTexas Has a Lower Share of\nUnderwater Mortgages\nPercent of mortgages with balance > home value*\n60\n52\n50\n40\n40\n\n35\n32\n\n30\n\n25\n22\n\n20\n9\n\n10\n0\nNevada\n\nFlorida\n\nArizona\n\nMichigan\n\n* As of fourth quarter 2012.\nSOURCE: CoreLogic.\n\nRobust new-home construction …\n\n6\n\nCalifornia\n\nTexas\n\nU.S.\n\n\fTexas New-Home Construction\nIndex, January 2005 =100*\n180\nMultifamily permits\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\nSingle-family permits\n\n60\n40\n\nResidential housing starts\n\n20\n0\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n* NOTE: Seasonally adjusted, five-month moving average.\nSOURCES: U.S. Census Bureau; Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\n\nAnd an export sector that has come out of the recession like gee-whiz.

He came home with the piece that was Texas\n7\n\n\fand a smirk on his face: “Mom,” he said, “guess what? If you pull Texas out of the puzzle of the\nUnited States, the rest of the country falls down!”\nAlthough little Charles lives in Massachusetts, he gets the picture. It came as no surprise when a\nrecent study by the highly respected Brookings Institution, as reported in the Wall Street Journal\nlast week, revealed that only 14 of the nation’s 100 biggest metropolitan areas have more people\nemployed than they did before the 2007–09 recession and that six of them are in Texas: Austin,\nSan Antonio, McAllen, Dallas, Houston and … El Paso. “Robust employment in the oil and gas\nindustries helped the Texas cities,” the article read, “although data from the Texas Workforce\nCommission suggests the job recovery has come from a variety of industries.”3 Amen to that.\nEl Paso at a Crossroads\nYou’ll note that El Paso was mentioned in the Brookings study. Let’s talk a little about this\nunique city.\nIt’s no small wonder that of the 23,000 students enrolled at UTEP, 77 percent are Mexican–\nAmericans and another 6 percent commute from Ciudad Juárez, across the border. El Paso is at\nthe very nexus of the cultures and economies of two countries. As Roberto Coronado, our\neconomist and assistant vice president in charge at our El Paso Branch, likes to point out, “Given\nits unique geographic position, El Paso is very good at importing recessions both from the north\nand from the south of the Rio Grande.” I would add that it’s also good at drawing from the best\nof both countries in recoveries. The El Paso labor market has outperformed that of the U.S. for\nseveral years. Here is a graph that shows how the El Paso employment picture has changed\nrelative to the U.S. since the onset of the Great Recession:\n\nComparing the Recovery in the\nEl Paso and U.S. Labor Markets\nIndex, December 2007 = 100\n104\n\nEl Paso\n\n2.9%\n\n102\n100\n\n-2.2%\n98\nU.S.\n\n96\n94\n92\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; HAVER Analytics.\n\nNow, as the following chart demonstrates, it remains a fact that the local employment picture is\nless bright in El Paso than in Texas’s other major metro areas.\n8\n\n\fEmployment by Metro Area\nIndex, peak employment = 100\n110\nAustin\n108\n106\n\nHouston\nTexas\nSan Antonio\n\nT = months from peak employment\n\n104\n\nD-FW\n102\nEl Paso\n100\n98\n96\n94\nT\n\nT +10\n\nT +20\n\nT +30\n\nT +40\n\nT +50\n\nT +60\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nThe unemployment rate here is hovering around 9 percent. El Paso’s unemployment rate has\nhistorically been 2 percentage points higher than the U.S. rate and 3.2 percentage points above\nthe Texas rate. In part, this is due to population growth. El Paso had more than 21 million border\ncrossings in 2011 alone. Most of these visitors came to shop, but many stayed and looked for\njobs. These visitors increase the number of job seekers in the unemployment equation, driving\nthe rate upward.\nOf additional concern is that El Paso is more dependent on federal government employment than\nany other Texas city, with 5 percent of your workforce coming from the public sector. And that\nis before accounting for the payroll of Fort Bliss itself and the impact it has on private-sector\nemployment and consumption. Clearly, El Paso is quite vulnerable to constriction in the growth\nof federal spending. This will ultimately present serious challenges as the federal government\nstruggles to right its fiscal imbalances.\nThe Good News\nBut there is good news that offsets that risk:\nThanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA—an agreement that, as Diana\nmentioned, I played a role in implementing as deputy U.S. trade representative—El Paso is no\nlonger at the edge of the United States but, instead, at a strategic location in the vast North\nAmerican market.\nIn this context, the maquiladoras of Ciudad Juárez become an important factor determining El\nPaso’s economic fate. The relationship exists via a ricochet effect that begins with U.S. industrial\nactivity picking up, say in auto manufacturing, followed by new production orders being sent to\nCiudad Juárez maquiladora plants and then economic benefits flowing back to El Paso. The\n9\n\n\fflowback to El Paso comes from firms on this side of the border providing logistical support,\ninsurance and other services to the maquiladoras—as well as in the aforementioned form of\nmaquiladora employees shopping and consuming more on this side of the border. And, as this\ntable shows, it results in an increase of high-value-added sales of El Paso-based services into\nCiudad Juárez, making up for reductions in manufacturing jobs on this side of the border:\n\nCiudad Juárez Maquiladoras’\nImpact on El Paso\nPercent increase per every 10 percent\nincrease in maquiladora output\nTotal employment\n\n2.8\n\nTransportation employment\n\n5.3\n\nRetail trade employment\n\n1.3\n\nFinance, insurance, real estate employment\n\n2.1\n\nServices employment\n\n1.8\n\nManufacturing employment\n\n-1.3\n\nSOURCE: “The Impact of Maquiladoras on U.S. Border Cities,” by Jesus Cañas, Roberto Coronado, Robert W. Gilmer and Eduardo\nSaucedo, Growth and Change, forthcoming.\n\n¡Sigue México!\nAs the maquiladora example illustrates, Mexico has a significant impact on the fate of the El\nPaso economy.\nThis is fortunate because the Mexican economy is being transformed to a greater degree than\nmost people here in El Norte understand.\nOn Sunday, the Dallas Morning News kindly ran an op-ed piece I wrote based on the work of\nour Dallas Fed economists, titled “Mexico Outdoes the U.S. on Fiscal Discipline.”4 The article\noutlines the great progress Mexico has made in transforming its economy and the significant\nsteps taken by President Enrique Peña Nieto in the footsteps of his predecessors, from President\nCalderon back to President Salinas.\nHere are the facts:\nMexico recovered more quickly from the recession than the United States.\nMexico’s 3.3 percent GDP growth in 2012 compares with the U.S.’s 1.7 percent.\nMexico, home to 1980s hyperinflation and a poster child of that decade’s Latin American debt\ncrisis, has recorded a core consumer price index annual inflation rate below 3 percent for the last\n10\n\n\fthree months. In fact, inflation in Mexico has trended down for two decades following two\nimportant reforms: central bank independence in 1994 and adoption of inflation targeting in\n2001.\nMeanwhile, the peso, floating since late 1994, held its own through the global financial crisis.\nAnd year to date, the peso has gained 6.9 percent against the dollar.\nLow and stable inflation, together with a steady peso, has protected the purchasing power of the\nMexican consumer and allowed nest eggs to grow. Those nest eggs can now be safely deposited\nin banks. After a horrific banking crisis in 1994–95 and an ensuing decade of stagnant lending,\nMexico’s banking industry is growing again and financial access, while still limited, is\nexpanding quickly. The number of Mexican banks increased 14.3 percent in 2012; in the U.S.,\nthe number of institutions contracted 3.1 percent. It may be surprising to you that Mexican banks\nare also better capitalized than U.S. banks. As of Dec. 31, 2012, equity-to-asset ratios were 11.1\npercent at U.S. banks and 15.9 percent at Mexican banks.\nOn the fiscal front, Mexico’s 2012 budget deficit was a respectable 2.6 percent of GDP, which\ncompares with 7 percent here. For all their differences, Mexican lawmakers on the right and the\nleft have a commitment to fiscal discipline. They adopted a balanced-budget rule in 2006 and\nhave chosen to abide by it rather than take the “kick the can down the road” approach of the U.S.\nCongress. As a result, Mexico’s national debt is stable at 28 percent of GDP, while here it raced\npast $16 trillion in 2012, about 105 percent of GDP.\nMexico has also remained a staunch proponent of free trade. Exports and imports now make up\n62 percent of Mexican economic output versus 17.5 percent as recently as 1980. Since Mexico\njoined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the forerunner of the World Trade\nOrganization) in 1986 and ratified NAFTA in 1994, it has forged 12 trade pacts with 44 nations.\nWith all the progress in the macro economy, banking, finance and trade, structural reforms are\nwhat Mexico now needs to catapult it to a leadership role among emerging-market economies. If\nPresident Peña Nieto’s first 100 days in office are any indication, this critical next step is\nunderway. He has engineered the Pacto por México (Pact for Mexico) with the other political\nparties; arrested Elba Esther Gordillo, the corrupt leader of the massive national teachers’ union;\nbrought a class-action suit against Carlos Slim’s growth-retarding telecommunications empire;\nand begun a national conversation about reforming the country’s woefully underperforming, yet\npotentially rich energy sector.\nIf this effort at structural modernization continues, Mexico’s growth will increase significantly.\nAll of this will be good for El Paso. Just as El Paso suffers when recession afflicts both sides of\nthe border, it will prosper as expansion takes hold here in the U.S. and in Mexico.\nThe Good, the Bad and the Comical\nLet me give you a pictorial summary of this lecture:\n\n11\n\n\fWe are blessed by a force of nature named Diana Natalicio (a Texas blonde, by the way!) …\n\nCourtesy of UTEP University Communications\n\nBy UTEP as a symbol of El Paso’s critical place at the crossroads of North America …\n\n12\n\n\fBy having the good fortune to live in Texas …\n\nAnd by sharing a border with an increasingly successful neighbor to our south.\nBut we also have challenges. It would be unbecoming of a central banker to be entirely\noptimistic—we are a pretty sober species. So here is the bad news. Here’s what is holding back\nthe economic progress of El Paso, Texas, Mexico and America:\n\n13\n\n\fYup—Washington. The Federal Reserve has provided plenty of, if not too much, high-octane\nfuel in the form of cheap and abundant money to propel the economy forward. Our southern\nneighbor, Mexico, is responsibly managing its fiscal affairs and structural reforms (as is our\nnorthern neighbor, Canada).\nTexas is showing the nation the way to create jobs and encourage prosperity with a highly\ndiversified economy. And yet Congress and executive branch cannot agree on a budget, or on a\npath forward for taxes and spending, or on a regulatory structure that incentivizes business to put\npeople back to work.\nThis is the subject of an entire separate lecture. But to summarize the root fiscal problem of past\nCongresses and administrations, Democrat- or Republican-led, my staff found a clip on YouTube\nthat sums it up better than words: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df_6r_tZqGo.\nThat sketch says it all. We must all pray that our president and our congressional representatives\nwill find a way to reverse their spendthrift ways and do what is right by putting us back on the\npath of fiscal probity.\nEl Paso and Texas have done well despite the disorderly behavior of our nation’s fiscal\nauthorities. Imagine how well we would do if they actually managed to get their act together!\nAs we eagerly await that day, let us be thankful for the exceptional nature of this great state, this\ngreat city and this wonderful university. ¡Ándale Pues!\nGracias.\n\n14\n\n\fNotes\n1\n\nAs quoted by Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan, Minister of Culture, Youth and Community Development and\nChancellor, Higher Colleges of Technology, in his speech at Sharjah Women’s College, United Arab Emirates,\nMarch 27, 2013.\n2\nSee “Easy Money: Fed Policies Spur Corporate Spending,” by Victoria McGrane, Wall Street Journal, April 9,\n2013.\n3\nSee “Hiring Spreads, but Only 14 Cities Top Prerecession Level,” by Amy Schatz, Wall Street Journal, March 31,\n2013.\n4\nSee “Mexico Outdoes the U.S. on Fiscal Discipline,” by Richard W.

        "content": "Comments on Monetary Policy\nand ‘Too Big to Fail’\n(With a Tribute to Irving Kristol)\nRemarks before Columbia University’s\nSchool of International and Public Affairs\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nNew York, N.Y.\nFebruary 27, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fComments on Monetary Policy and ‘Too Big to Fail’\n(With a Tribute to Irving Kristol)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Professor [Merit] Janow. The title of this lectureship far overstates my standing and\ncapacity—I am unworthy of being considered “distinguished” at anything other than having\nhelped raise four children whose talents far surpass my own. But I thank you for this\nmomentarily hyperbolic honor.1\nAs Merit mentioned, we go back a long way. Yet my involvement with Columbia University and\nMorningside Heights goes back much further. After I graduated from Harvard in 1971, I needed\nmoney to pay for Oxford, so I spent most of a year working as a busboy and bartender and doing\na number of odd jobs in Washington, D.C.—testimony to the immediate benefits of a Harvard\ndegree in economics! Starved for intellectual sustenance as I waited to return to academia, I\nfound comfort in reading about public policy, especially in the essays of what was then a new\njournal, The Public Interest.\nThe Public Interest was the brainchild of Irving Kristol and Daniel Bell (subsequently joined by\nNathan Glazer)—originally young Trotskyites who had spent their days as students at the City\nCollege of New York (CCNY), the “Harvard of the Proletariat”—“trying to understand how the\nsocialist ideal of political and economic justice had ended in Joseph Stalin’s murderous\ntyranny.”2 They later migrated to what we would now consider prototypical Roosevelt-cumLyndon Johnson liberalism, and then evolved into “neoconservatives.” These three men were\nbecoming iconic public intellectuals, and The Public Interest was something of a personal\njournal of lessons they learned during their ideological transformation.\nKristol and Bell ran a series of evening seminar/workshops here on this campus and at CCNY.\nAt every opportunity, I would take an afternoon off, jump on a bus to New York, attend their\nevening talks, find some kindly student to let me sleep in a dorm room and return by bus to\nWashington the next morning. All this is by way of saying that I have been coming to Columbia\nfor over 40 years, almost as many years as the number of consecutive games lost in the historical\nlosing streak of your illustrious football team.\nI was especially captivated by Irving Kristol. His book, Two Cheers for Capitalism, praised\ncapitalism because, one, “it works, in a quite simple, material sense;” and two, it is “congenial to\na large measure of personal liberty.”3 Kristol famously described himself as “a liberal who had\nbeen mugged by reality.” In writing a loving homage to Kristol when he died, David Brooks of\nthe New York Times summarized the basis for Kristol’s epiphany in more colorful language.\n“The elemental Jewish commandment” in the working-class neighborhood where Kristol grew\nup was: “Don’t be a schmuck. Don’t fall for fantastical notions that have nothing to do with the\nway people really are.”4\nAs a member of the team of earnest men and women who form the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), I consider myself a central banker who has been mugged by the reality of\n1\n\n\fhaving been an investor and market operator. I am constantly wary of fantastical notions that\nseem cogent in economic or monetary theory but run counter to what I learned in the\nmarketplace or run the risk of departing from practice in the real economy—of possibly having\nnothing to do with the way people and businesses, those who actually operate our economy,\nreally are.\nToday, I am going to discuss two such risks as I see them: the current program of quantitative\neasing and the effect of the Dodd–Frank legislation aimed at preventing “too big to fail.” I’ll do\nthis in short order and as provocatively as possible so as to give professors Calomiris and Svejnar\nplenty of ammo to use during the inquisition that will follow my remarks.\nMonetary Policy and Quantitative Easing\nI have argued against what I have called “Buzz Lightyear” monetary policy—pledging to hold\nthe federal funds rate at zero seemingly to infinity and beyond, while purchasing longer-term\nTreasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month, reinvesting principal payments on all\nagency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and purchasing MBS at a pace of\n$40 billion per month.5 Indeed, other than our initial program to underpin a recovery in the\nhousing market with our initial tranche of purchases of MBS, I have opposed all other large-scale\nasset purchases or quantitative easing (QE) programs. Why have I been so obstinate in my\nopposition to this well-intended program?\nI fully understand its theoretical underpinnings. But I question its efficacy.\nConfined as the Fed is at the “zero bound,” the only means of adding monetary fuel to the\neconomy has been to purchase Treasury and MBS securities. When we buy something, we pay\nfor it, putting money into the economy. That money—backed by an assurance that the FOMC\nwill hold interest rates at zero and continue large-scale asset purchases for a prolonged period—\nshould, theoretically, be put to use: a) by banks’ lending to consumers and to businesses that will\nexpand employment, or b) by investors who, rediscounting valuations in the fixed-income and\nequity markets, will drive those markets higher in price, creating a “wealth effect.” This wealth\neffect should lead to further consumption as well as greater employment by businesses whose\nbalance sheets have been reconfigured and enriched both by the cheapest leverage in American\nhistory and by booming prices for their stock.\nAll these actions are in keeping with the dual mandate that the Federal Reserve was given by the\nCongress of the United States. It calls for us to operate independently both to maintain price\nstability and conduct policy in a way that engenders full employment. Given that inflation and,\nimportantly, inflationary expectations are presently “contained,” it would seem theoretically\ncompelling to pursue the policy that we have undertaken.\nBut a not-so-funny thing has happened on the way to the reality forum. While bankers and other\nsources of credit have slowly but consistently liberalized their lending practices, borrowers have\nnot been especially keen to put cheap and super-abundant credit to use in expanding payrolls to\nthe degree the FOMC desires.\nTo be sure, we have, as hoped, seen a reinvigorated housing market. Indeed, FOMC records will\nshow that based on the superb work done by two housing-market experts at the Dallas Fed—\nJohn Duca and Anthony Murphy, working with John Muellbauer at Oxford—and thanks to our\n2\n\n\ffield soundings with housing and housing-related business leaders, the Dallas Fed was way\nahead of others at the FOMC table both in warning of the housing market debacle and then\nrecognizing the housing recovery.6 The fact that the housing-market gears have now begun to\nmesh is why I believe we are running the risk of overkill by continuing our mortgage-backed\nsecurities purchase program at the current pace and would suggest tapering off those purchases.\nAs to the more broadly impactful Treasury purchases, occurring as they have simultaneously\nwith a loss of confidence in the euro bond markets—I like to say that, relatively speaking, the\nU.S. economy has been the “best-looking horse in the glue factory”—they have indeed led to a\nmassive bond and stock market rally. For the ninth time in U.S. history, we have experienced a\ndoubling of the market indexes; corporate borrowing rates are at the lowest levels on record,\nincluding those for CCC-rated credits that are just north of default.\nThat’s the good news. Some sharp market operators have done very well. For private-equity\nfirms, for example, hyper-accommodative monetary policy has offered a chance to go back to the\nglories of payment-in-kind and other financial techniques that enrich financiers but may not\ncreate employment. For the largest banks and financial institutions, policy has helped dig them\nout of the holes in which they found themselves (including the hole of executive compensation).\nAnd for the wealthiest investors, even unto the revered Oracle of Omaha, there has been the\nwindfall of super-abundant credit that, after adjusting for tax deductions on interest and a\nmodicum of inflation, is practically free. Ordinary savers and retirees have benefited from the\nturnaround in the all-important housing sector, but with the remainder of their savings, they have\nbeen waylaid on the sidelines of the zero bound. In addition, the 5,500 or so smaller banks that\nare the backbone of our communities have seen their interest margins squeezed severely. The\nwealth effect, in other words, has been unbalanced. Main Street does not seem to have been\nimpacted to the same degree as Wall Street.\nTo be sure, as mentioned, businesses have been able to improve their balance sheets and are\nenjoying higher stock market valuations of their businesses. However, thus far, businesses have\npursued payroll-expanding job creation with less enthusiasm than had been hoped for.\nUnemployment remains annoyingly high. There are some pockets of exception like Texas, which\nnow operates at employment levels 3.1 percent above its prerecession peak and, over the last\ndecade, has created jobs across the entire income spectrum. Nationwide, meanwhile, job creation\nhas been weak and in the important middle-income quartiles has been shrinking.\nEmployers large and small, privately owned or publicly traded, will tell you that despite access\nto cheap and abundant capital, they are hesitant to make long-term commitments, including\nhiring significant numbers of permanent workers. They cite uncertain growth prospects for the\ngoods and services they sell at home, where consumption is retarded by slow growth in\nemployment and, lately, by the increase in payroll taxes. And abroad, these employers point to\nthe dampened consumption stemming from the economic debacle in Europe and its knock-on\neffects on China and the export-led emerging economies. They are uncertain about fiscal policy,\nnot knowing what their taxes will be and what will happen to all-important federal spending that\ndirectly impacts them or their customers. They are uncertain as to the ultimate effect on their cost\nstructures of the seemingly endless expansion of health care and other mandates and regulations,\nhowever meritorious their intention. And, for some, there is a deeply imbedded worry that the\nFed’s contortion of the yield curve and cost of money cannot last forever, or, if it lasts too long,\n3\n\n\fwill eventually result in financial bubbles and/or uncontrollable inflation, adding another\nuncertainty to the plethora of uncertain factors that already plague them.\nAs I walked down memory lane in preparation for this lecture today, I thought of my days at\nbusiness school in the mid-1970s. Everything we learned in business school was oriented toward\noperating and growing companies under the assumption of constrained, conservative debt\nmarkets and a fundamentals-driven equity market. Today, the opposite obtains: Credit is superabundant and stock market behavior is conditioned not so much by the fundamental performance\nof its underlying companies but by increasing doses of monetary Ritalin.7 Against this backdrop,\nI am not surprised by the reaction of businesses. Operating in a highly uncertain environment, it\nis eminently sensible for them to defensively use their newly strengthened balance sheets to buy\nback shares and pay out dividends or employ them offensively in ways—say, in making\nacquisitions—that often lead to employee rationalization, not payroll expansion for U.S.\nworkers.\nThis is how businesses really think; this is the way people really are.\nThe bottom line is that rather than achieve the intended theoretical effect, I believe the policy of\nsuper-abundant money at costs deviating substantially from normal equilibrium levels may\nultimately prove to be counterproductive. Or it may restrain the benefits that theory might\nsuggest.\nIf this is so, should we continue with the current program of QE? I have argued we should not,\nthat we are pushing on a string. But let me qualify this. I was, indeed, against the escalating\nrounds of QE, questioning their efficacy. But now that we have them in place, and the fixedincome and stock markets are hooked on the monetary Ritalin that we have dispensed in everlarger doses, it would, in my opinion, do great harm to force a sudden withdrawal. So, I have\nargued that it would be best to taper the dose of QE so that markets can adjust gradually to the\neventual removal of this treatment and return to pricing securities on the basis of fundamentals.\nAm I right or wrong? I pose this question to professors Calomiris and Svejnar for the discussion\nthat will follow.\nLet me add one more thought for the good professors to contemplate before moving on to the\ntopic of too big to fail (TBTF). This is, admittedly, out of left (or perhaps in the spirit of Irving\nKristol, right) field: Having posited that, thus far, the wealth-effect phenomenon has been\nconcentrated in both the housing sector—a Main Street benefit, and a powerful one—and the\nhands of the savviest operators—those most able to exploit free and abundant money, primarily a\nsmaller base consisting of the big banks and the investment community on Wall Street—and\ngiven that private sector job creators are in a defensive crouch and the federal government is\nlikely to remain in cost-containment mode, might there be a way for others charged with\nfiduciary responsibility to the broader public to capitalize on the current moment?\nFor example, Texas, with its highly rated government credit, has navigated its 26 million people\nthrough the Great Recession with strong fiscal fundamentals and a dynamic economy that has\npersistently outperformed the United States and, indeed, all other large states for at least the past\ntwo decades.8 Might it make sense for Texas to issue ultra-long bonds at currently prevailing\nultra-low rates to finance the state’s longer-term infrastructure needs? I have in mind a Texas\n4\n\n\fCentury Bond. The public benefit would come from saving on interest payments that will\ninevitably rise over time from their unprecedented low levels—certainly sometime in the next\n100 years—meanwhile financing highways, water projects, universities and the like that will be\nneeded to continue serving the state’s growing population and expanding economy. If ever there\nwere a window for such an issuance, it surely would be now.\nDomestic entities seeking to match longer-term liabilities and commitments as well as sovereign\ninvestors like the Norwegians are keen on finding “risk free” dollar-denominated assets of long\nduration. Mexico and private universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have\nplaced century bonds. Because the U.S. government cannot capitalize on such demand and is\nstuck in a rut of issuing short-dated debt so as not to add to its deficits, could or should other\ndollar-based “sovereign” issuers like the best credit-rated states, especially a large one like\nTexas, do so? I’ll just throw that out for your contemplation.\nToo Big to Fail\nNow, on to TBTF.\nEveryone and their sister knows that financial institutions deemed TBTF were at the epicenter of\nthe 2007–09 financial crisis. Previously thought of as islands of safety in a sea of risk, they\nbecame the enablers of a financial tsunami. Now that the storm has subsided, my colleagues at\nthe Dallas Fed and I submit that they are another key reason accommodative monetary policy\nand government policies have failed to adequately spur the economic recovery. Our research\ndirector, Harvey Rosenblum, and I first wrote about this in an article published in the Wall Street\nJournal in September 2009, titled “The Blob That Ate Monetary Policy.”9 Put simply, sick banks\ndon’t lend. Sick—seriously undercapitalized—megabanks severely constricted their usual\nlending and capital-market activities during the crisis and economic recovery. They brought\neconomic growth to a standstill and spread their sickness to the rest of the banking system.\nCongress thought it would address the issue of TBTF through the Dodd–Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act. Preventing TBTF from ever occurring again is in the very\npreamble of the act. We contend that Dodd–Frank has not done enough to corral TBTF banks\nand that, on balance, the act has made things worse, not better. We submit that, in the short run,\nparts of Dodd–Frank have exacerbated the weakness in economic growth by increasing\nregulatory uncertainty in key sectors of the U.S. economy. Despite its good intention, it has been\ncounterproductive, working against solving the core problems it seeks to address.\nLet me define what we mean when we speak of TBTF. The Dallas Fed’s definition is financial\nfirms whose owners, managers, creditors, shareholders and customers believe them to be exempt\nfrom the processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction. Such firms capture the financial\nupside of their actions but largely avoid payment—bankruptcy and closure—for actions gone\nwrong, in violation of one of the basic tenets of market capitalism (at least as it is supposed to be\npracticed in the United States). Such firms enjoy implicit subsidies relative to their non-TBTF\ncompetitors. They are thus more likely to take greater risks in search of profits, protected by the\npresumption that bankruptcy is a highly unlikely outcome.\nThe phenomenon of TBTF is the result of an implicit but widely taken-for-granted governmentsanctioned policy of coming to the aid of a financial institution deemed to be so large,\ninterconnected and/or complex that its failure could substantially damage the financial system.\n5\n\n\fBy reducing a TBTF firm’s exposure to losses from excessive risk taking, such policies\nundermine the discipline that market forces normally assert on management decisionmaking.\nThe reduction of market discipline has been further eroded by implicit extensions of the federal\nsafety net beyond commercial banks to their nonbank affiliates. Moreover, industry\nconsolidation, fostered by subsidized growth (and during the crisis, encouraged by the federal\ngovernment in the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and\nWachovia), has perpetuated and enlarged the weight of financial firms deemed TBTF. This\nreduces competition.\nDodd–Frank does not do enough to constrain the behemoth banks’ advantages. Indeed, given the\neconomies of scale in handling regulation, Dodd–Frank’s excessive complexity works to\nundermine the competitiveness of smaller banks, thereby offsetting some of the act’s other\naspects that curtail TBTF banks’ dominance. It unwittingly exacerbates the problem it set out to\nsolve.\nAndrew Haldane, the highly respected member of the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of\nEngland, addressed this at last summer’s Jackson Hole, Wyo., policymakers’ meeting in witty\nremarks titled, “The Dog and the Frisbee.”10 I highly recommend this speech to you.\nHaldane noted that Dodd–Frank comes against a backdrop of ever-greater escalation of financial\nregulation. He pointed out that nationally chartered banks began to file the antecedents of “call\nreports” after the formation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1863. The\nFederal Reserve Act of 1913 required state-chartered member banks to do the same, having them\nsubmitted to the Federal Reserve starting in 1917. They were short forms; in 1930, Haldane\nnoted, these reports numbered 80 entries. “In 1986, [the ‘call reports’ submitted by bank holding\ncompanies] covered 547 columns in Excel; by 1999, 1,208 columns. By 2011 … 2,271\ncolumns.” “Fortunately,” he added wryly, “Excel had expanded sufficiently to capture the\nincrease.”\nThough this increasingly complex reporting failed to prevent detection of the seeds of the\ndebacle of 2007–09, Dodd–Frank has layered on copious amounts of new complexity. The\nlegislation has 16 titles and runs 848 pages. It spawns litter upon litter of regulations: More than\n8,800 pages of regulations have already been proposed, and the process is not yet done.\nIn his speech, Haldane noted—conservatively, in my view—that a survey of the Federal Register\nshowed that complying with these new rules would require 2,260,631 labor hours each year. He\nadded: “Of course, the costs of this regulatory edifice would be considered small if they\ndelivered even modest improvements to regulators’ ability to avert future crises.” He went on to\nargue the wick is not worth the candle, before concluding: “Modern finance is complex, perhaps\ntoo complex. Regulation of modern finance is complex, almost certainly too complex. That\nconfiguration spells trouble. As you do not fight fire with fire, you do not fight complexity with\ncomplexity. [The situation] requires a regulatory response grounded in simplicity, not\ncomplexity.”\nThis case for more effectively treating TBTF is especially compelling given the subsidy these\ninstitutions now enjoy by virtue of their protected status.\n6\n\n\fThis TBTF subsidy is quite large and has risen after the financial crisis. Recent estimates by the\nBank for International Settlements, for example, suggest that the implicit government guarantee\nprovides the largest U.S. bank holding companies with an average credit rating uplift of more\nthan two notches, thereby lowering average funding costs a full percentage point relative to\nsmaller competitors.11 Our aforementioned friend, Andy Haldane, estimates the implicit TBTF\nglobal subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global institutions identified by the\nFinancial Stability Board (2011) as “systemically important.”12 To put that $300 billion\nestimated annual subsidy in perspective, all the U.S. bank holding companies summed together\nreported 2011 earnings of $108 billion.\nHarvey Rosenblum and I, and our team at the Dallas Fed, have proposed a simple amendment to\nDodd–Frank to remedy the TBTF pathology. We would eliminate the mumbo-jumbo, ineffective\nand costly complexity of the law; relieve the regulatory imposition it imposes on non-TBTF\nbanks that do not pose systemic or broad risk to the economy or financial system; and eliminate\nthe unfair subsidy the TBTF holding companies enjoy at the expense of their smaller\ncompetitors. Our proposal would effectively level the playing field for all banking organizations\nand provide better protection for taxpaying citizens.\nI laid our proposal out in a speech in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 16. You might access it and\nstudy its details.13 In a nutshell, we recommend that within a complex bank holding company,\nonly the commercial banking operations that intermediate short-term deposits into longer-term\nloans would benefit from federal deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve’s discount\nwindow. All other operations of a complex bank holding company and all “shadow banking”\naffiliates of that company would not have this protection or access to the Fed’s window. To\nreinforce the understanding that taxpayers will not come to the aid of the risks taken by those\nentities, every customer, creditor and counterparty of every shadow-banking affiliate and of the\nsenior holding company would be required to sign a new covenant, a simple disclosure that need\nbe no more complex than this: “Conducting business with this affiliate of XYZ bank holding\ncompany carries NO federal deposit insurance or other government protection or guarantees. The\ncounterparty herein fully understands that in conducting business with XYZ’s banking affiliate,\nit has NO federal government protection or guarantees, and its investment is totally at risk.”\nUnfortunately, established customer relationships are slow to change. To accelerate the transition\nto a more competitive financial system, our proposal has a third element to help level the playing\nfield. Specifically, we recommend that the largest financial institutions be restructured so that\nevery one of their corporate entities is subject to a speedy bankruptcy process, and in the case of\nbanking entities, that each be of a size that is “too small to save.” This would underscore to\ncustomers and creditors that a credible regime shift has taken place, and the reign of TBTF\npolicies is over.\nTo circle back to Irving Kristol, I believe this suggested remedy to the pathology of TBTF\n“works, in a quite simple, material sense” and is “congenial to a large measure of personal\nliberty.” It most certainly dispenses with fantastical notions of the way people really are.\nI have thrown a lot at you in this long speech. Thank you for tolerating me. Now, in the best\ntradition of central bankers, I will do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you and the\ngood professors present may ask.\n7\n\n\fNotes\n1\n\nColumbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, Spring 2013 Distinguished Speaker in\nInternational Finance and Economic Policy.\n2\n“About the film: Finding My Way to the Alcoves (1999),” by director Joseph Dorman, PBS Online.\n3\nTwo Cheers for Capitalism, by Irving Kristol (New York: Basic Books 1978).\n4\n“Three Cheers for Irving,” by David Brooks, New York Times, Sept. 22, 2009, p.

        "content": "Ending ‘Too Big to Fail’:\nA Proposal for Reform Before It’s Too Late\n(With Reference to Patrick Henry, Complexity and Reality)\n\nRemarks before the Committee for the Republic\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nWashington, D.C.\nJanuary 16, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fEnding ‘Too Big to Fail’:\nA Proposal for Reform Before It’s Too Late\n(With Reference to Patrick Henry, Complexity and Reality)\nRichard W. Fisher\nIt is an honor to be introduced by my college classmate, John Henry. John is a descendant of the\niconic patriot, Patrick Henry. Most of John’s ancestors were prominent colonial Virginians and\nmany were anti-crown. Patrick, however, was the most outspoken. Ask John why this was so,\nand he will answer: “Patrick was poor.”\nHowever poor he may have been, Patrick Henry was a rich orator. In one of his greatest\nspeeches, he said: “Different men often see the same subject in different lights; and therefore, I\nhope that it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do, opinions\nof a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely, and without\nreserve. This is no time for ceremony … [it] is one of awful moment to this country.”\nPatrick Henry was addressing the repression of the American colonies by the British crown.\nTonight, I wish to speak to a different kind of repression—the injustice of being held hostage to\nlarge financial institutions considered “too big to fail,” or TBTF for short.\nI submit that these institutions, as a result of their privileged status, exact an unfair tax upon the\nAmerican people. Moreover, they interfere with the transmission of monetary policy and inhibit\nthe advancement of our nation’s economic prosperity.\nI have spoken of this for several years, beginning with a speech on the “Pathology of Too-Bigto-Fail” in July 2009.1 My colleague, Harvey Rosenblum—a highly respected economist and the\nDallas Fed’s director of research—and I and our staff have written about it extensively.\nTomorrow, we will issue a special report that further elucidates our proposal for dealing with the\npathology of TBTF. It also addresses the superior relative performance of community banks\nduring the recent crisis and how they are being victimized by excessive regulation that stems\nfrom responses to the sins of their behemoth counterparts. I urge all of you to read that report.2\nNow, Federal Reserve convention requires that I issue a disclaimer here: I speak only for the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, not for others associated with our central bank. That is usually\nabundantly clear. In many matters, my staff and I entertain opinions that are very different from\nthose of many of our esteemed colleagues elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System. Today, I\n“speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve” on the issue of TBTF, while meaning no\ndisrespect to others who may hold different views.\nThe Problem of TBTF\nEveryone and their sister knows that financial institutions deemed too big to fail were at the\nepicenter of the 2007–09 financial crisis. Previously thought of as islands of safety in a sea of\nrisk, they became the enablers of a financial tsunami. Now that the storm has subsided, we\nsubmit that they are a key reason accommodative monetary policy and government policies have\nfailed to adequately affect the economic recovery. Harvey Rosenblum and I first wrote about this\n1\n\n\fin an article published in the Wall Street Journal in September 2009, “The Blob That Ate\nMonetary Policy.”3 Put simply, sick banks don’t lend. Sick—seriously undercapitalized—\nmegabanks stopped their lending and capital market activities during the crisis and economic\nrecovery. They brought economic growth to a standstill and spread their sickness to the rest of\nthe banking system.\nCongress thought it would address the issue of TBTF through the Dodd–Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act. Preventing TBTF from ever occurring again is in the very\npreamble of the act. We contend that Dodd–Frank has not done enough to corral TBTF banks\nand that, on balance, the act has made things worse, not better. We submit that, in the short run,\nparts of Dodd–Frank have exacerbated weak economic growth by increasing regulatory\nuncertainty in key sectors of the U.S. economy. It has clearly benefited many lawyers and\ncreated new layers of bureaucracy. Despite its good intention, it has been counterproductive,\nworking against solving the core problem it seeks to address.\nDefining TBTF\nLet me define what we mean when we speak of TBTF. The Dallas Fed’s definition is financial\nfirms whose owners, managers and customers believe themselves to be exempt from the\nprocesses of bankruptcy and creative destruction. Such firms capture the financial upside of their\nactions but largely avoid payment—bankruptcy and closure—for actions gone wrong, in\nviolation of one of the basic tenets of market capitalism (at least as it is supposed to be practiced\nin the United States). Such firms enjoy subsidies relative to their non-TBTF competitors. They\nare thus more likely to take greater risks in search of profits, protected by the presumption that\nbankruptcy is a highly unlikely outcome.\nThe phenomenon of TBTF is the result of an implicit but widely taken-for-granted governmentsanctioned policy of coming to the aid of the owners, managers and creditors of a financial\ninstitution deemed to be so large, interconnected and/or complex that its failure could\nsubstantially damage the financial system. By reducing a TBTF firm’s exposure to losses from\nexcessive risk taking, such policies undermine the discipline that market forces normally assert\non management decisionmaking.\nThe reduction of market discipline has been further eroded by implicit extensions of the federal\nsafety net beyond commercial banks to their nonbank affiliates. Moreover, industry\nconsolidation, fostered by subsidized growth (and during the crisis, encouraged by the federal\ngovernment in the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and\nWachovia), has perpetuated and enlarged the weight of financial firms deemed TBTF. This\nreduces competition in lending.\nDodd–Frank does not do enough to constrain the behemoth banks’ advantages. Indeed, given its\ncomplexity, it unwittingly exacerbates them.\nComplexity Bites\nAndrew Haldane, the highly respected member of the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of\nEngland, addressed this at last summer’s Jackson Hole, Wyo., policymakers’ meeting in witty\nremarks titled, “The Dog and the Frisbee.”4 Here are some choice passages from that noteworthy\nspeech.\n2\n\n\fHaldane notes that regulators’ “… efforts to catch the crisis Frisbee have continued to escalate.\nCasual empiricism reveals an ever-growing number of regulators … Ever-larger litters have not,\nhowever, obviously improved the watchdogs’ Frisbee-catching abilities. [After all,] no regulator\nhad the foresight to predict the financial crisis, although some have since exhibited supernatural\npowers of hindsight.\n“So what is the secret of the watchdogs’ failure? The answer is simple. Or rather, it is complexity\n… complex regulation … might not just be costly and cumbersome but sub-optimal. … In\nfinancial regulation, less may be more.”\nOne is reminded of the comment French Prime Minister Clemenceau made about President\nWilson’s 14 points: “Why 14?” he asked. “God did it in 10.”\nWere that we only had 14 points of financial regulation to contend with today. Haldane notes\nthat Dodd–Frank comes against a background of ever-greater escalation of financial regulation.\nHe points out that nationally chartered banks began to file the antecedents of “call reports” after\nthe formation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1863. The Federal Reserve Act\nof 1913 required state-chartered member banks to do the same, having them submitted to the\nFederal Reserve starting in 1917. They were short forms; in 1930, Haldane noted, these reports\nnumbered 80 entries. “In 1986, [the ‘call reports’ submitted by bank holding companies] covered\n547 columns in Excel, by 1999, 1,208 columns. By 2011 … 2,271 columns.” “Fortunately,” he\nadds wryly, “Excel had expanded sufficiently to capture the increase.”\nThough this growingly complex reporting failed to prevent detection of the seeds of the debacle\nof 2007–09, Dodd–Frank has layered on copious amounts of new complexity. The legislation has\n16 titles and runs 848 pages. It spawns litter upon litter of regulations: More than 8,800 pages of\nregulations have already been proposed, and the process is not yet done. In his speech, Haldane\nnoted—conservatively, in my view—that a survey of the Federal Register showed that\ncomplying with these new rules would require 2,260,631 labor hours each year. He added: “Of\ncourse, the costs of this regulatory edifice would be considered small if they delivered even\nmodest improvements to regulators’ ability to avert future crises.” He then goes on to argue the\nwick is not worth the candle. And he concludes: “Modern finance is complex, perhaps too\ncomplex. Regulation of modern finance is complex, almost certainly too complex. That\nconfiguration spells trouble. As you do not fight fire with fire, you do not fight complexity with\ncomplexity. [The situation] requires a regulatory response grounded in simplicity, not\ncomplexity. Delivering that would require an about-turn.”\nThe Dallas Fed’s Proposal: A Reasonable ‘About-Turn’\nThe Dallas Fed’s proposal offers an “about-turn” and a way to mend the flaws in Dodd–Frank. It\nfights unnecessary complexity with simplicity where appropriate. It eliminates much of the\nmumbo-jumbo, ineffective, costly complexity of Dodd–Frank. Of note, it would be especially\nhelpful to non-TBTF banks that do not pose systemic or broad risk to the economy or the\nfinancial system. Our proposal would relieve small banks of some unnecessary burdens arising\nfrom Dodd–Frank that unfairly penalize them. Our proposal would effectively level the playing\nfield for all banking organizations in the country and provide the best protection for taxpaying\ncitizens.\n\n3\n\n\fIn a nutshell, we recommend that TBTF financial institutions be restructured into multiple\nbusiness entities. Only the resulting downsized commercial banking operations—and not shadow\nbanking affiliates or the parent company—would benefit from the safety net of federal deposit\ninsurance and access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\nDefining the Landscape\nIt is important to have an accurate view of the landscape of banking today in order to understand\nthe impact of this proposal.\nAs of third quarter 2012, there were approximately 5,600 commercial banking organizations in\nthe U.S. The bulk of these—roughly 5,500—were community banks with assets of less than $10\nbillion. These community-focused organizations accounted for 98.6 percent of all banks but only\n12 percent of total industry assets. Another group numbering nearly 70 banking organizations—\nwith assets of between $10 billion and $250 billion—accounted for 1.2 percent of banks, while\ncontrolling 19 percent of industry assets. The remaining group, the megabanks—with assets of\nbetween $250 billion and $2.3 trillion—was made up of a mere 12 institutions. These dozen\nbehemoths accounted for roughly 0.2 percent of all banks, but they held 69 percent of industry\nassets.\n\nThe 12 institutions that presently account for 69 percent of total industry assets are candidates to\nbe considered TBTF because of the threat they could pose to the financial system and the\neconomy should one or more of them get into trouble. By contrast, should any of the other 99.8\n\n4\n\n\fpercent of banking institutions get into trouble, the matter most likely would be settled with\nprivate-sector ownership changes and minimal governmental intervention.\nHow and why does this work for 99.8 percent but not the other 0.2 percent?\nTo answer this question, it helps to consider the sources of regulatory and market discipline\nimposed on each of the three groups of banks.\nLet’s look at two dimensions of regulatory discipline: Potential closure of the institution and the\neffectiveness of supervisory pressure on bank management practices.\nDo the owners and managers of a banking institution operate with the belief that their institution\nis subject to a bankruptcy process that works reasonably quickly to transfer ownership and\ncontrol to another banking entity or entities? Is there a group of interested and involved\nshareholders that can exert a restraining force on franchise-threatening risk taking by the bank’s\ntop management team? Can management be replaced and ownership value wiped out? Is the firm\ncontrolled de facto by its owners, or instead effectively management-controlled?5 In addition, we\nask: To what extent do uninsured creditors of the banking entity impose risk-management\ndiscipline on management?\nThis analytical framework is summarized in the following slide:\n\nLooking across line 1, it is clear that community banks are subject to considerable regulatory and\nshareholder discipline. They can and do fail. In the last few years, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp. (FDIC) has built a reputation for regulators carrying out Joseph Schumpeter’s concept of\n5\n\n\f“creative destruction” by taking over small banks on a Friday evening and reopening them on\nMonday morning under new ownership. “In on Friday, out by Monday” is the mantra of this\nprocess.\nKnowing the power of banking supervisors to close the institution, owners and managers of\ncommunity banks heed supervisory suggestions to limit risk. Community banks often have a few\nsignificant shareholders who have a considerable portion of their wealth tied to the fate of the\nbank. Consequently, they exert substantial control over the behavior of management because risk\nand potential closure matter to them. Since community banks derive the bulk of their funding\nfrom federally insured deposits, they are simple rather than complex in their capital structure and\nrarely have uninsured and unsecured creditors. “Market discipline” over management practices is\nprimarily exerted through shareholders.\nOf the three groups, the 70 regional and moderate-sized banking organizations depicted in line 2\nare subject to a broader range of market discipline. Like community banks, these institutions are\nnot exempt from the bankruptcy process; they can and do fail. But given their size, complexity\nand generally larger geographic footprint, the failure resolution and ownership transfer processes\ncannot always be accomplished over a weekend. In practice, owners and managers of mid-sized\ninstitutions are nonetheless aware of the downside consequences of the risks taken by the\ninstitution. Uninsured depositors and unsecured creditors are also aware of their unprotected\nstatus in the event the institution experiences financial difficulties. Mid-sized banking institutions\nreceive a good dose of external discipline from both supervisors and market-based signals.\nTBTF megabanks, depicted in line 3, receive far too little regulatory and market discipline. This\nis unfortunate because their failure, if it were allowed, could disrupt financial markets and the\neconomy. For all intents and purposes, we believe that TBTF banks have not been allowed to fail\noutright.6 Knowing this, the management of TBTF banks can, to a large extent, choose to resist\nthe advice and guidance of their bank supervisors’ efforts to impose regulatory discipline. And\nfor TBTF banks, the forces of market discipline from shareholders and unsecured creditors are\nlimited.\nLet’s first consider discipline from shareholders. Having millions of stockholders has diluted\nshareholders’ ability to prevent the management of TBTF banks from pursuing corporate\nstrategies that are profitable for management, though not necessarily for shareholders.\nAs we learned during the crisis, adverse information on poor financial performance often is\navailable too late for shareholder reaction or credit default swap (CDS) spreads to have any\nimpact on management behavior. For example, during the financial crisis, shares in two of the\nlargest bank holding companies (BHCs) declined more than 95 percent from their prior peak\nprices and their CDS spreads went haywire.7 The ratings agencies eventually reacted, in keeping\nwith their tendency to be reactive rather than proactive. But the damage from excessive risk\ntaking had already been done. And after the crisis? Judging from the behavior of many of the\nlargest BHCs, with limited exception, efforts by shareholders of these institutions to\nmeaningfully influence management compensation practices have been slow in coming. So much\nfor shareholder discipline as a check on TBTF banks.\nUnfortunately, TBTF banks also do not face much external discipline from unsecured creditors.\nAn important facet of TBTF is that the funding sources for megabanks extend far beyond insured\n6\n\n\fdeposits, as referenced by my mention of CDS spreads. The largest banks, not just the TBTF\nbanks, fund themselves with a wide range of liabilities. These include large, negotiable CDs,\nwhich often exceed the FDIC insurance limit; federal funds purchased from other banks, all of\nwhich are uninsured, and subordinated notes and bonds, generally unsecured. It is not unusual\nfor such uninsured/unsecured liabilities to account for well over half the liabilities of TBTF\ninstitutions. If market discipline were to be imposed on TBTF institutions, one would expect it to\ncome from uninsured/unsecured depositors, creditors and debt holders. But TBTF status exerts\nperverse market discipline on the risk-taking activities of these banks. Unsecured creditors\nrecognize the implicit government guarantee of TBTF banks’ liabilities. As a result, unsecured\ndepositors and creditors offer their funds at a lower cost to TBTF banks than to mid-sized and\nregional banks that face the risk of failure.\nThis TBTF subsidy is quite large and has risen following the financial crisis. Recent estimates by\nthe Bank for International Settlements, for example, suggest that the implicit government\nguarantee provides the largest U.S. BHCs with an average credit rating uplift of more than two\nnotches, thereby lowering average funding costs a full percentage point relative to their smaller\ncompetitors.8 Our aforementioned friend from the Bank of England, Andrew Haldane, estimates\nthe current implicit TBTF global subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global\ninstitutions identified by the Financial Stability Board (2011) as “systemically important.”9 To\nput that $300 billion estimated annual subsidy in perspective, all the U.S. BHCs summed\ntogether reported 2011 earnings of $108 billion.\nAdd to that the burdens stemming from the complexity of TBTF banks. Here is the basic\norganization diagram for a typical complex financial holding company:\n\n7\n\n\fTo simplify a complex issue, one might consider all the operations other than the commercial\nbanking operation as shadow banking affiliates, including any special investment vehicles—or\nSIVs—of the commercial bank.10\nNow, consider this table. It gives you a sense of the size and scope of some of the five largest\nBHCs, noting their nondeposit liabilities in billions of dollars and their number of total\nsubsidiaries and countries of operation (according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council):\n\nFor perspective, consider the sad case of Lehman Brothers. More than four years later, the\nLehman bankruptcy is still not completely resolved. As of its 10-K regulatory filing in 2007,\nLehman operated a mere 209 subsidiaries across only 21 countries and had total liabilities of\n$619 billion. By these metrics, Lehman was a small player compared with any of the Big Five. If\nLehman Brothers was too big for a private-sector solution while still a going concern, what can\nwe infer about the Big Five in the table?\nCorrecting for the Drawbacks of Dodd–Frank\nDodd–Frank addresses this concern. Under the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions of\nDodd–Frank, a systemically important financial institution would receive debtor-in-possession\nfinancing from the U.S. Treasury over the period its operations needed to be stabilized. This is\nquasi-nationalization, just in a new, and untested, format. In Dallas, we consider government\nownership of our financial institutions, even on a “temporary” basis, to be a clear distortion of\nour capitalist principles. Of course, an alternative would be to have another systemically\nimportant financial institution acquire the failing institution. We have been down that road\n8\n\n\falready. All it does is compound the problem, expanding the risk posed by the even larger\nsurviving behemoth organizations. In addition, perpetuating the practice of arranging shotgun\nmarriages between giants at taxpayer expense worsens the funding disadvantage faced by the\n99.8 percent remaining—small and regional banks. Merging large institutions is a form of\ndiscrimination that favors the unwieldy and dangerous TBTF banks over more focused, fit and\ndisciplined banks.\nThe approach of the Dallas Fed neither expands the reach of government nor further handicaps\nthe 99.8 percent of community and regional banks. Nor does it fight complexity with complexity.\nIt calls for reshaping TBTF banking institutions into smaller, less-complex institutions that are:\neconomically viable; profitable; competitively able to attract financial capital and talent; and of a\nsize, complexity and scope that allows both regulatory and market discipline to restrain excessive\nrisk taking.\nOur proposal is simple and easy to understand. It can be accomplished with minimal statutory\nmodification and implemented with as little government intervention as possible. It calls first for\nrolling back the federal safety net to apply only to basic, traditional commercial banking.\nSecond, it calls for clarifying, through simple, understandable disclosures, that the federal safety\nnet applies only to the commercial bank and its customers and never ever to the customers of any\nother affiliated subsidiary or the holding company. The shadow banking activities of financial\ninstitutions must not receive taxpayer support.\nWe recognize that undoing customer inertia and management habits at TBTF banking\ninstitutions may take many years. During such a period, TBTF banks could possibly sow the\nseeds for another financial crisis. For these reasons, additional action may be necessary. The\nTBTF BHCs may need to be downsized and restructured so that the safety-net-supported\ncommercial banking part of the holding company can be effectively disciplined by regulators and\nmarket forces. And there will likely have to be additional restrictions (or possibly prohibitions)\non the ability to move assets or liabilities from a shadow banking affiliate to a banking affiliate\nwithin the holding company.11\nTo illustrate how the first two points in our plan would work, I come back to the hypothetical\nstructure of a complex financial holding company. Recall that this type of holding company has a\ncommercial bank subsidiary and several subsidiaries that are not traditional commercial banks:\ninsurance, securities underwriting and brokerage, finance company and others, many with a vast\ngeographic reach.\nWhere the Government Safety Net Would Begin and End\nUnder our proposal, only the commercial bank would have access to deposit insurance provided\nby the FDIC and discount window loans provided by the Federal Reserve. These two features of\nthe safety net would explicitly, by statute, become unavailable to any shadow banking affiliate,\nspecial investment vehicle of the commercial bank or any obligations of the parent holding\ncompany. This is largely the current case—but in theory, not in practice. And consistent\nenforcement is viewed as unlikely.\n\n9\n\n\fReinforced by a New Covenant\nTo reinforce the statute and its credibility, every customer, creditor and counterparty of every\nshadow banking affiliate and of the senior holding company would be required to agree to and\nsign a new covenant, a simple disclosure statement that acknowledges their unprotected status. A\nsample disclosure need be no more complex than this:\n\n10\n\n\fA Simple Disclaimer and Disclosure\nSample Disclosure:\n“WARNING: Conducting business with this affiliate of the _______ bank\nholding company carries NO federal deposit insurance or other federal\ngovernment protection or guarantees. I ____________, fully understand that\nin conducting business with ___________ banking affiliate, I have NO\nfederal deposit insurance or other federal government protection or\nguarantees, and my investment is totally at risk.”\n\nThis two-part step should begin to remove the implicit TBTF subsidy provided to BHCs and\ntheir shadow banking operations. Entities other than commercial banks have inappropriately\nbenefited from an implicit safety net. Our proposal promotes competition in light of market and\nregulatory discipline, replacing the status quo of subsidized and perverse incentives to take\nexcessive risk.\nAs indicated earlier, some government intervention may be necessary to accelerate the\nimposition of effective market discipline. We believe that market forces should be relied upon as\nmuch as practicable. However, entrenched oligopoly forces, in combination with customer\ninertia, will likely only be overcome through government-sanctioned reorganization and\nrestructuring of the TBTF BHCs. A subsidy once given is nearly impossible to take away.\nThus, it appears we may need a push, using as little government intervention as possible to\nrealign incentives, reestablish a competitive landscape and level the playing field.\nWhy Protect the 0.2 Percent?\nMy team at the Dallas Fed and I are confident this simple treatment to the complex problem and\nrisks posed by TBTF institutions would be the most effective treatment. Think about it this way:\nAt present, 99.8 percent of the banking organizations in America are subject to sufficient\nregulatory or shareholder/market discipline to contain the risk of misbehavior that could threaten\nthe stability of the financial system. Zero-point-two percent are not. Their very existence\nthreatens both economic and financial stability. Furthermore, to contain that risk, regulators and\nmany small banks are tied up in regulatory and legal knots at an enormous direct cost to them\nand a large indirect cost to our economy. Zero-point-two percent. If the administration and the\nCongress could agree as recently as two weeks ago on legislation that affects 1 percent of\n11\n\n\ftaxpayers, surely it can process a solution that affects 0.2 percent of the nation’s banks and is less\ncomplex and far more effective than Dodd–Frank.\nMaking a Time of ‘Awful Moment’ a Time of Promise\nThe time has come to change the decisionmaking paradigm. There should be more than the\npresent two solutions: bailout or the end-of-the-economic-world-as-we-have-known-it. Both\nchoices are unacceptable. The next financial crisis could cost more than two years of economic\noutput, borne by millions of U.S. taxpayers. That horrendous cost must be weighed against the\nsupposed benefits of maintaining the TBTF status quo. To us, the remedy is obvious: end TBTF\nnow. End TBTF by reintroducing market forces instead of complex rules, and in so doing, level\nthe playing field for all banking institutions.\nI return to Patrick Henry. He noted that “it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she\ntransforms us.” We labor under the siren song of Dodd–Frank and the recent run-up in the\npricing of TBTF bank stocks and credit, indulging in the illusion of hope that this complex\nlegislation will end too big to fail and right the banking system. We shut our eyes to the painful\ntruth that TBTF represents an ongoing danger not just to financial stability, but also to fair\ncompetition.\nThe Dallas Fed offers a modest but, we believe, far more effective fix to Dodd–Frank. This plan\nis not without its costs. But it is less costly than all the alternatives put forward and it seriously\nreduces the likelihood of another horrendous and costly financial crisis.\nThis need not be a time of “awful moment.” It should instead be a time of promise. Treating the\npathology of TBTF now would be a big step toward a more stable and prosperous economic\nsystem, one that relies on fundamental principles of capitalism rather than regulatory complexity\nand increasing government intervention.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\nSee “Two Areas of Present Concern: the Economic Outlook and the Pathology of Too-Big-to-Fail (With Reference\nto Errol Flynn, Johnny Mercer, Gary Stern and Voltaire),” speech by Richard W.

        "content": "Ending ‘Too Big to Fail’:\nA Proposal for Reform Before It’s Too Late\n(With Reference to Patrick Henry, Complexity and Reality)\n\nRemarks before the Committee for the Republic\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nWashington, D.C.\nJanuary 16, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fEnding ‘Too Big to Fail’:\nA Proposal for Reform Before It’s Too Late\n(With Reference to Patrick Henry, Complexity and Reality)\nRichard W. Fisher\nIt is an honor to be introduced by my college classmate, John Henry. John is a descendant of the\niconic patriot, Patrick Henry. Most of John’s ancestors were prominent colonial Virginians and\nmany were anti-crown. Patrick, however, was the most outspoken. Ask John why this was so,\nand he will answer: “Patrick was poor.”\nHowever poor he may have been, Patrick Henry was a rich orator. In one of his greatest\nspeeches, he said: “Different men often see the same subject in different lights; and therefore, I\nhope that it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do, opinions\nof a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely, and without\nreserve. This is no time for ceremony … [it] is one of awful moment to this country.”\nPatrick Henry was addressing the repression of the American colonies by the British crown.\nTonight, I wish to speak to a different kind of repression—the injustice of being held hostage to\nlarge financial institutions considered “too big to fail,” or TBTF for short.\nI submit that these institutions, as a result of their privileged status, exact an unfair tax upon the\nAmerican people. Moreover, they interfere with the transmission of monetary policy and inhibit\nthe advancement of our nation’s economic prosperity.\nI have spoken of this for several years, beginning with a speech on the “Pathology of Too-Bigto-Fail” in July 2009.1 My colleague, Harvey Rosenblum—a highly respected economist and the\nDallas Fed’s director of research—and I and our staff have written about it extensively.\nTomorrow, we will issue a special report that further elucidates our proposal for dealing with the\npathology of TBTF. It also addresses the superior relative performance of community banks\nduring the recent crisis and how they are being victimized by excessive regulation that stems\nfrom responses to the sins of their behemoth counterparts. I urge all of you to read that report.2\nNow, Federal Reserve convention requires that I issue a disclaimer here: I speak only for the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, not for others associated with our central bank. That is usually\nabundantly clear. In many matters, my staff and I entertain opinions that are very different from\nthose of many of our esteemed colleagues elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System. Today, I\n“speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve” on the issue of TBTF, while meaning no\ndisrespect to others who may hold different views.\nThe Problem of TBTF\nEveryone and their sister knows that financial institutions deemed too big to fail were at the\nepicenter of the 2007–09 financial crisis. Previously thought of as islands of safety in a sea of\nrisk, they became the enablers of a financial tsunami. Now that the storm has subsided, we\nsubmit that they are a key reason accommodative monetary policy and government policies have\nfailed to adequately affect the economic recovery. Harvey Rosenblum and I first wrote about this\n1\n\n\fin an article published in the Wall Street Journal in September 2009, “The Blob That Ate\nMonetary Policy.”3 Put simply, sick banks don’t lend. Sick—seriously undercapitalized—\nmegabanks stopped their lending and capital market activities during the crisis and economic\nrecovery. They brought economic growth to a standstill and spread their sickness to the rest of\nthe banking system.\nCongress thought it would address the issue of TBTF through the Dodd–Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act. Preventing TBTF from ever occurring again is in the very\npreamble of the act. We contend that Dodd–Frank has not done enough to corral TBTF banks\nand that, on balance, the act has made things worse, not better. We submit that, in the short run,\nparts of Dodd–Frank have exacerbated weak economic growth by increasing regulatory\nuncertainty in key sectors of the U.S. economy. It has clearly benefited many lawyers and\ncreated new layers of bureaucracy. Despite its good intention, it has been counterproductive,\nworking against solving the core problem it seeks to address.\nDefining TBTF\nLet me define what we mean when we speak of TBTF. The Dallas Fed’s definition is financial\nfirms whose owners, managers and customers believe themselves to be exempt from the\nprocesses of bankruptcy and creative destruction. Such firms capture the financial upside of their\nactions but largely avoid payment—bankruptcy and closure—for actions gone wrong, in\nviolation of one of the basic tenets of market capitalism (at least as it is supposed to be practiced\nin the United States). Such firms enjoy subsidies relative to their non-TBTF competitors. They\nare thus more likely to take greater risks in search of profits, protected by the presumption that\nbankruptcy is a highly unlikely outcome.\nThe phenomenon of TBTF is the result of an implicit but widely taken-for-granted governmentsanctioned policy of coming to the aid of the owners, managers and creditors of a financial\ninstitution deemed to be so large, interconnected and/or complex that its failure could\nsubstantially damage the financial system. By reducing a TBTF firm’s exposure to losses from\nexcessive risk taking, such policies undermine the discipline that market forces normally assert\non management decisionmaking.\nThe reduction of market discipline has been further eroded by implicit extensions of the federal\nsafety net beyond commercial banks to their nonbank affiliates. Moreover, industry\nconsolidation, fostered by subsidized growth (and during the crisis, encouraged by the federal\ngovernment in the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and\nWachovia), has perpetuated and enlarged the weight of financial firms deemed TBTF. This\nreduces competition in lending.\nDodd–Frank does not do enough to constrain the behemoth banks’ advantages. Indeed, given its\ncomplexity, it unwittingly exacerbates them.\nComplexity Bites\nAndrew Haldane, the highly respected member of the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of\nEngland, addressed this at last summer’s Jackson Hole, Wyo., policymakers’ meeting in witty\nremarks titled, “The Dog and the Frisbee.”4 Here are some choice passages from that noteworthy\nspeech.\n2\n\n\fHaldane notes that regulators’ “… efforts to catch the crisis Frisbee have continued to escalate.\nCasual empiricism reveals an ever-growing number of regulators … Ever-larger litters have not,\nhowever, obviously improved the watchdogs’ Frisbee-catching abilities. [After all,] no regulator\nhad the foresight to predict the financial crisis, although some have since exhibited supernatural\npowers of hindsight.\n“So what is the secret of the watchdogs’ failure? The answer is simple. Or rather, it is complexity\n… complex regulation … might not just be costly and cumbersome but sub-optimal. … In\nfinancial regulation, less may be more.”\nOne is reminded of the comment French Prime Minister Clemenceau made about President\nWilson’s 14 points: “Why 14?” he asked. “God did it in 10.”\nWere that we only had 14 points of financial regulation to contend with today. Haldane notes\nthat Dodd–Frank comes against a background of ever-greater escalation of financial regulation.\nHe points out that nationally chartered banks began to file the antecedents of “call reports” after\nthe formation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1863. The Federal Reserve Act\nof 1913 required state-chartered member banks to do the same, having them submitted to the\nFederal Reserve starting in 1917. They were short forms; in 1930, Haldane noted, these reports\nnumbered 80 entries. “In 1986, [the ‘call reports’ submitted by bank holding companies] covered\n547 columns in Excel, by 1999, 1,208 columns. By 2011 … 2,271 columns.” “Fortunately,” he\nadds wryly, “Excel had expanded sufficiently to capture the increase.”\nThough this growingly complex reporting failed to prevent detection of the seeds of the debacle\nof 2007–09, Dodd–Frank has layered on copious amounts of new complexity. The legislation has\n16 titles and runs 848 pages. It spawns litter upon litter of regulations: More than 8,800 pages of\nregulations have already been proposed, and the process is not yet done. In his speech, Haldane\nnoted—conservatively, in my view—that a survey of the Federal Register showed that\ncomplying with these new rules would require 2,260,631 labor hours each year. He added: “Of\ncourse, the costs of this regulatory edifice would be considered small if they delivered even\nmodest improvements to regulators’ ability to avert future crises.” He then goes on to argue the\nwick is not worth the candle. And he concludes: “Modern finance is complex, perhaps too\ncomplex. Regulation of modern finance is complex, almost certainly too complex. That\nconfiguration spells trouble. As you do not fight fire with fire, you do not fight complexity with\ncomplexity. [The situation] requires a regulatory response grounded in simplicity, not\ncomplexity. Delivering that would require an about-turn.”\nThe Dallas Fed’s Proposal: A Reasonable ‘About-Turn’\nThe Dallas Fed’s proposal offers an “about-turn” and a way to mend the flaws in Dodd–Frank. It\nfights unnecessary complexity with simplicity where appropriate. It eliminates much of the\nmumbo-jumbo, ineffective, costly complexity of Dodd–Frank. Of note, it would be especially\nhelpful to non-TBTF banks that do not pose systemic or broad risk to the economy or the\nfinancial system. Our proposal would relieve small banks of some unnecessary burdens arising\nfrom Dodd–Frank that unfairly penalize them. Our proposal would effectively level the playing\nfield for all banking organizations in the country and provide the best protection for taxpaying\ncitizens.\n\n3\n\n\fIn a nutshell, we recommend that TBTF financial institutions be restructured into multiple\nbusiness entities. Only the resulting downsized commercial banking operations—and not shadow\nbanking affiliates or the parent company—would benefit from the safety net of federal deposit\ninsurance and access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\nDefining the Landscape\nIt is important to have an accurate view of the landscape of banking today in order to understand\nthe impact of this proposal.\nAs of third quarter 2012, there were approximately 5,600 commercial banking organizations in\nthe U.S. The bulk of these—roughly 5,500—were community banks with assets of less than $10\nbillion. These community-focused organizations accounted for 98.6 percent of all banks but only\n12 percent of total industry assets. Another group numbering nearly 70 banking organizations—\nwith assets of between $10 billion and $250 billion—accounted for 1.2 percent of banks, while\ncontrolling 19 percent of industry assets. The remaining group, the megabanks—with assets of\nbetween $250 billion and $2.3 trillion—was made up of a mere 12 institutions. These dozen\nbehemoths accounted for roughly 0.2 percent of all banks, but they held 69 percent of industry\nassets.\n\nThe 12 institutions that presently account for 69 percent of total industry assets are candidates to\nbe considered TBTF because of the threat they could pose to the financial system and the\neconomy should one or more of them get into trouble. By contrast, should any of the other 99.8\n\n4\n\n\fpercent of banking institutions get into trouble, the matter most likely would be settled with\nprivate-sector ownership changes and minimal governmental intervention.\nHow and why does this work for 99.8 percent but not the other 0.2 percent?\nTo answer this question, it helps to consider the sources of regulatory and market discipline\nimposed on each of the three groups of banks.\nLet’s look at two dimensions of regulatory discipline: Potential closure of the institution and the\neffectiveness of supervisory pressure on bank management practices.\nDo the owners and managers of a banking institution operate with the belief that their institution\nis subject to a bankruptcy process that works reasonably quickly to transfer ownership and\ncontrol to another banking entity or entities? Is there a group of interested and involved\nshareholders that can exert a restraining force on franchise-threatening risk taking by the bank’s\ntop management team? Can management be replaced and ownership value wiped out? Is the firm\ncontrolled de facto by its owners, or instead effectively management-controlled?5 In addition, we\nask: To what extent do uninsured creditors of the banking entity impose risk-management\ndiscipline on management?\nThis analytical framework is summarized in the following slide:\n\nLooking across line 1, it is clear that community banks are subject to considerable regulatory and\nshareholder discipline. They can and do fail. In the last few years, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp. (FDIC) has built a reputation for regulators carrying out Joseph Schumpeter’s concept of\n5\n\n\f“creative destruction” by taking over small banks on a Friday evening and reopening them on\nMonday morning under new ownership. “In on Friday, out by Monday” is the mantra of this\nprocess.\nKnowing the power of banking supervisors to close the institution, owners and managers of\ncommunity banks heed supervisory suggestions to limit risk. Community banks often have a few\nsignificant shareholders who have a considerable portion of their wealth tied to the fate of the\nbank. Consequently, they exert substantial control over the behavior of management because risk\nand potential closure matter to them. Since community banks derive the bulk of their funding\nfrom federally insured deposits, they are simple rather than complex in their capital structure and\nrarely have uninsured and unsecured creditors. “Market discipline” over management practices is\nprimarily exerted through shareholders.\nOf the three groups, the 70 regional and moderate-sized banking organizations depicted in line 2\nare subject to a broader range of market discipline. Like community banks, these institutions are\nnot exempt from the bankruptcy process; they can and do fail. But given their size, complexity\nand generally larger geographic footprint, the failure resolution and ownership transfer processes\ncannot always be accomplished over a weekend. In practice, owners and managers of mid-sized\ninstitutions are nonetheless aware of the downside consequences of the risks taken by the\ninstitution. Uninsured depositors and unsecured creditors are also aware of their unprotected\nstatus in the event the institution experiences financial difficulties. Mid-sized banking institutions\nreceive a good dose of external discipline from both supervisors and market-based signals.\nTBTF megabanks, depicted in line 3, receive far too little regulatory and market discipline. This\nis unfortunate because their failure, if it were allowed, could disrupt financial markets and the\neconomy. For all intents and purposes, we believe that TBTF banks have not been allowed to fail\noutright.6 Knowing this, the management of TBTF banks can, to a large extent, choose to resist\nthe advice and guidance of their bank supervisors’ efforts to impose regulatory discipline. And\nfor TBTF banks, the forces of market discipline from shareholders and unsecured creditors are\nlimited.\nLet’s first consider discipline from shareholders. Having millions of stockholders has diluted\nshareholders’ ability to prevent the management of TBTF banks from pursuing corporate\nstrategies that are profitable for management, though not necessarily for shareholders.\nAs we learned during the crisis, adverse information on poor financial performance often is\navailable too late for shareholder reaction or credit default swap (CDS) spreads to have any\nimpact on management behavior. For example, during the financial crisis, shares in two of the\nlargest bank holding companies (BHCs) declined more than 95 percent from their prior peak\nprices and their CDS spreads went haywire.7 The ratings agencies eventually reacted, in keeping\nwith their tendency to be reactive rather than proactive. But the damage from excessive risk\ntaking had already been done. And after the crisis? Judging from the behavior of many of the\nlargest BHCs, with limited exception, efforts by shareholders of these institutions to\nmeaningfully influence management compensation practices have been slow in coming. So much\nfor shareholder discipline as a check on TBTF banks.\nUnfortunately, TBTF banks also do not face much external discipline from unsecured creditors.\nAn important facet of TBTF is that the funding sources for megabanks extend far beyond insured\n6\n\n\fdeposits, as referenced by my mention of CDS spreads. The largest banks, not just the TBTF\nbanks, fund themselves with a wide range of liabilities. These include large, negotiable CDs,\nwhich often exceed the FDIC insurance limit; federal funds purchased from other banks, all of\nwhich are uninsured, and subordinated notes and bonds, generally unsecured. It is not unusual\nfor such uninsured/unsecured liabilities to account for well over half the liabilities of TBTF\ninstitutions. If market discipline were to be imposed on TBTF institutions, one would expect it to\ncome from uninsured/unsecured depositors, creditors and debt holders. But TBTF status exerts\nperverse market discipline on the risk-taking activities of these banks. Unsecured creditors\nrecognize the implicit government guarantee of TBTF banks’ liabilities. As a result, unsecured\ndepositors and creditors offer their funds at a lower cost to TBTF banks than to mid-sized and\nregional banks that face the risk of failure.\nThis TBTF subsidy is quite large and has risen following the financial crisis. Recent estimates by\nthe Bank for International Settlements, for example, suggest that the implicit government\nguarantee provides the largest U.S. BHCs with an average credit rating uplift of more than two\nnotches, thereby lowering average funding costs a full percentage point relative to their smaller\ncompetitors.8 Our aforementioned friend from the Bank of England, Andrew Haldane, estimates\nthe current implicit TBTF global subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global\ninstitutions identified by the Financial Stability Board (2011) as “systemically important.”9 To\nput that $300 billion estimated annual subsidy in perspective, all the U.S. BHCs summed\ntogether reported 2011 earnings of $108 billion.\nAdd to that the burdens stemming from the complexity of TBTF banks. Here is the basic\norganization diagram for a typical complex financial holding company:\n\n7\n\n\fTo simplify a complex issue, one might consider all the operations other than the commercial\nbanking operation as shadow banking affiliates, including any special investment vehicles—or\nSIVs—of the commercial bank.10\nNow, consider this table. It gives you a sense of the size and scope of some of the five largest\nBHCs, noting their nondeposit liabilities in billions of dollars and their number of total\nsubsidiaries and countries of operation (according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council):\n\nFor perspective, consider the sad case of Lehman Brothers. More than four years later, the\nLehman bankruptcy is still not completely resolved. As of its 10-K regulatory filing in 2007,\nLehman operated a mere 209 subsidiaries across only 21 countries and had total liabilities of\n$619 billion. By these metrics, Lehman was a small player compared with any of the Big Five. If\nLehman Brothers was too big for a private-sector solution while still a going concern, what can\nwe infer about the Big Five in the table?\nCorrecting for the Drawbacks of Dodd–Frank\nDodd–Frank addresses this concern. Under the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions of\nDodd–Frank, a systemically important financial institution would receive debtor-in-possession\nfinancing from the U.S. Treasury over the period its operations needed to be stabilized. This is\nquasi-nationalization, just in a new, and untested, format. In Dallas, we consider government\nownership of our financial institutions, even on a “temporary” basis, to be a clear distortion of\nour capitalist principles. Of course, an alternative would be to have another systemically\nimportant financial institution acquire the failing institution. We have been down that road\n8\n\n\falready. All it does is compound the problem, expanding the risk posed by the even larger\nsurviving behemoth organizations. In addition, perpetuating the practice of arranging shotgun\nmarriages between giants at taxpayer expense worsens the funding disadvantage faced by the\n99.8 percent remaining—small and regional banks. Merging large institutions is a form of\ndiscrimination that favors the unwieldy and dangerous TBTF banks over more focused, fit and\ndisciplined banks.\nThe approach of the Dallas Fed neither expands the reach of government nor further handicaps\nthe 99.8 percent of community and regional banks. Nor does it fight complexity with complexity.\nIt calls for reshaping TBTF banking institutions into smaller, less-complex institutions that are:\neconomically viable; profitable; competitively able to attract financial capital and talent; and of a\nsize, complexity and scope that allows both regulatory and market discipline to restrain excessive\nrisk taking.\nOur proposal is simple and easy to understand. It can be accomplished with minimal statutory\nmodification and implemented with as little government intervention as possible. It calls first for\nrolling back the federal safety net to apply only to basic, traditional commercial banking.\nSecond, it calls for clarifying, through simple, understandable disclosures, that the federal safety\nnet applies only to the commercial bank and its customers and never ever to the customers of any\nother affiliated subsidiary or the holding company. The shadow banking activities of financial\ninstitutions must not receive taxpayer support.\nWe recognize that undoing customer inertia and management habits at TBTF banking\ninstitutions may take many years. During such a period, TBTF banks could possibly sow the\nseeds for another financial crisis. For these reasons, additional action may be necessary. The\nTBTF BHCs may need to be downsized and restructured so that the safety-net-supported\ncommercial banking part of the holding company can be effectively disciplined by regulators and\nmarket forces. And there will likely have to be additional restrictions (or possibly prohibitions)\non the ability to move assets or liabilities from a shadow banking affiliate to a banking affiliate\nwithin the holding company.11\nTo illustrate how the first two points in our plan would work, I come back to the hypothetical\nstructure of a complex financial holding company. Recall that this type of holding company has a\ncommercial bank subsidiary and several subsidiaries that are not traditional commercial banks:\ninsurance, securities underwriting and brokerage, finance company and others, many with a vast\ngeographic reach.\nWhere the Government Safety Net Would Begin and End\nUnder our proposal, only the commercial bank would have access to deposit insurance provided\nby the FDIC and discount window loans provided by the Federal Reserve. These two features of\nthe safety net would explicitly, by statute, become unavailable to any shadow banking affiliate,\nspecial investment vehicle of the commercial bank or any obligations of the parent holding\ncompany. This is largely the current case—but in theory, not in practice. And consistent\nenforcement is viewed as unlikely.\n\n9\n\n\fReinforced by a New Covenant\nTo reinforce the statute and its credibility, every customer, creditor and counterparty of every\nshadow banking affiliate and of the senior holding company would be required to agree to and\nsign a new covenant, a simple disclosure statement that acknowledges their unprotected status. A\nsample disclosure need be no more complex than this:\n\n10\n\n\fA Simple Disclaimer and Disclosure\nSample Disclosure:\n“WARNING: Conducting business with this affiliate of the _______ bank\nholding company carries NO federal deposit insurance or other federal\ngovernment protection or guarantees. I ____________, fully understand that\nin conducting business with ___________ banking affiliate, I have NO\nfederal deposit insurance or other federal government protection or\nguarantees, and my investment is totally at risk.”\n\nThis two-part step should begin to remove the implicit TBTF subsidy provided to BHCs and\ntheir shadow banking operations. Entities other than commercial banks have inappropriately\nbenefited from an implicit safety net. Our proposal promotes competition in light of market and\nregulatory discipline, replacing the status quo of subsidized and perverse incentives to take\nexcessive risk.\nAs indicated earlier, some government intervention may be necessary to accelerate the\nimposition of effective market discipline. We believe that market forces should be relied upon as\nmuch as practicable. However, entrenched oligopoly forces, in combination with customer\ninertia, will likely only be overcome through government-sanctioned reorganization and\nrestructuring of the TBTF BHCs. A subsidy once given is nearly impossible to take away.\nThus, it appears we may need a push, using as little government intervention as possible to\nrealign incentives, reestablish a competitive landscape and level the playing field.\nWhy Protect the 0.2 Percent?\nMy team at the Dallas Fed and I are confident this simple treatment to the complex problem and\nrisks posed by TBTF institutions would be the most effective treatment. Think about it this way:\nAt present, 99.8 percent of the banking organizations in America are subject to sufficient\nregulatory or shareholder/market discipline to contain the risk of misbehavior that could threaten\nthe stability of the financial system. Zero-point-two percent are not. Their very existence\nthreatens both economic and financial stability. Furthermore, to contain that risk, regulators and\nmany small banks are tied up in regulatory and legal knots at an enormous direct cost to them\nand a large indirect cost to our economy. Zero-point-two percent. If the administration and the\nCongress could agree as recently as two weeks ago on legislation that affects 1 percent of\n11\n\n\ftaxpayers, surely it can process a solution that affects 0.2 percent of the nation’s banks and is less\ncomplex and far more effective than Dodd–Frank.\nMaking a Time of ‘Awful Moment’ a Time of Promise\nThe time has come to change the decisionmaking paradigm. There should be more than the\npresent two solutions: bailout or the end-of-the-economic-world-as-we-have-known-it. Both\nchoices are unacceptable. The next financial crisis could cost more than two years of economic\noutput, borne by millions of U.S. taxpayers. That horrendous cost must be weighed against the\nsupposed benefits of maintaining the TBTF status quo. To us, the remedy is obvious: end TBTF\nnow. End TBTF by reintroducing market forces instead of complex rules, and in so doing, level\nthe playing field for all banking institutions.\nI return to Patrick Henry. He noted that “it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she\ntransforms us.” We labor under the siren song of Dodd–Frank and the recent run-up in the\npricing of TBTF bank stocks and credit, indulging in the illusion of hope that this complex\nlegislation will end too big to fail and right the banking system. We shut our eyes to the painful\ntruth that TBTF represents an ongoing danger not just to financial stability, but also to fair\ncompetition.\nThe Dallas Fed offers a modest but, we believe, far more effective fix to Dodd–Frank. This plan\nis not without its costs. But it is less costly than all the alternatives put forward and it seriously\nreduces the likelihood of another horrendous and costly financial crisis.\nThis need not be a time of “awful moment.” It should instead be a time of promise. Treating the\npathology of TBTF now would be a big step toward a more stable and prosperous economic\nsystem, one that relies on fundamental principles of capitalism rather than regulatory complexity\nand increasing government intervention.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\nSee “Two Areas of Present Concern: the Economic Outlook and the Pathology of Too-Big-to-Fail (With Reference\nto Errol Flynn, Johnny Mercer, Gary Stern and Voltaire),” speech by Richard W.

More specifically,\nCitigroup and BankAmerica Corp. experienced peak-to-trough declines in their common stock prices of over 96\npercent.\n8\nBank for International Settlements 2011/2012 Annual Report, June 24, 2012, pp. 75–6.\n9\nSee “On Being the Right Size,” speech by Andrew Haldane, Bank of England, at the 2012 Beesley Lectures,\nInstitute of Economic Affairs’ 22nd Annual Series, London, Oct. 25, 2012.\n10\nFor a review of shadow banking, see “Understanding the Risks Inherent in Shadow Banking: A Primer and\nPractical Lessons Learned,” by David Luttrell, Harvey Rosenblum and Jackson Thies, Federal Reserve Bank of\nDallas Staff Papers, no. 18, 2012.\n11\nAs an example, Sen. David Vitter and Sen. Sherrod Brown cite in their letter to the Government Accountability\nOffice on Jan. 1, 2013, that “Bank of America moved $15 trillion in derivatives contracts from its broker-dealer,\nMerrill Lynch, to its insured depository institution affiliate in response to a credit downgrade. ... This move\nreportedly saved the bank $3.3 billion in additional collateral payments.”\n\n13\n\n\f"
