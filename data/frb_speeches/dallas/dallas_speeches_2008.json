Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nDecember 18, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fHistorical Perspectives on the Current\nEconomic and Financial Crisis\n(With Reference to Paul Volcker, Washington Irving, Walter Bagehot,\nMother Caris, Rube Goldberg and Bismarck)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Mr. Mayor. I am especially honored that you would take time from leading our great\ncity to introduce me so generously and to suffer through my speech.\nWe have witnessed the unfolding of historic economic developments during this tumultuous\nyear. I can think of no better groups than the World Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth and the\nDallas Committee on Foreign Relations with whom to discuss the year‘s events and lessons\nlearned.\nThe most cogent description of this year‘s economic developments might best be summarized by\na woman who, having just commiserated with her accountants, put it this way: ―This has been\nlike the divorce from hell: My net worth has been cut in half and I‘m still stuck with my\nhusband.‖ The mood and pace of the economy have shifted from near bliss to acrimony and an\nalmost palpable sense of betrayal. Many of our fellow citizens feel trapped in an unsustainable\nsituation.\nIn the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of economic growth.\nUnemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March. And the stock market closed at an all-time\nhigh, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day of Oct. 9, 2007, at 1,565. To be sure, there were\nsome signs of friction developing from the passion of the time—most noticeably a heating up of\nheadline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of this year.\nAnd there were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably\nin the housing market, but also on the balance sheets and business books of major creditors and\nvarious consumers. But to the outside world, all was well. Even for Bernard Madoff, who,\naccording to Bloomberg news, was getting $50 manicures before entertaining friends and clients\nat the Palm in the Hamptons or on his 55-foot yacht appropriately named ―Bull.‖1\nIn 2008, the gears shifted. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not belabor\nthem. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product is no\nlonger growing, but shrank half of a percent in the third quarter. By my estimate, it is on pace to\ncontract another annualized 4 to 5 percent in the current quarter with further contraction likely\nthrough at least the first half of next year. Industrial production is falling sharply; consumption is\ncascading downhill; demand has evaporated as businesses and consumers alike pull in their\nhorns and de-lever from excess indebtedness that fueled the prior boom. Unemployment has\nincreased to 6.7 percent at the last reading and appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and\npossibly past, 8 percent.\n\n1\n\n―Madoff Enjoyed $50 Pedicures, 9.8 Handicap, Boat Called ‗Bull,‘‖ by Mark Clothier and Oshrat Carmiel, Dec.\n17, 2008, http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aQv4Kmx.cs78.\n1\n\n\fBankers and other creditors, having noted that the horse long ago bolted from the confines of\nprudence, are now shutting the proverbial barn doors. The credit intermediation process has\nbecome dysfunctional. Once ubiquitous, credit has become quite expensive—if you can get it. As\nfor stocks, the S&P 500 Index closed last night at 904, 42 percent off its Oct. 9 peak and has\nbecome historically and hysterically volatile.\nI will not venture to predict the behavioral future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market.\nBut I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with an unforgiving stock\nmarket and creditors that have become tighter than a new pair of shoes, businesses are doing\nwhat they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every\ncost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are demanding that suppliers\ncut their prices. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting ―head count.‖ They are\ndelaying capital expenditures. They are watching their receivables and stretching out their\npayables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (If you know\nthe basics of accounting, you will appreciate the black humor of my dear friend, Janet Yellen, the\npresident of the San Francisco Fed. She recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets\nof consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and\nnothing on the right is right.)\nAnd sadly, as we all have read, the only things adorning Mr. Madoff‘s hands these days are\nhandcuffs, and he dines in less glamorous surroundings.\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed,\nwe must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including at the Federal Reserve,\nfailed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it\ngrew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of\nthe art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the\nsenior officers.\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following provides a more fulsome and\ninsightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as\nit perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n―Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when ‗the credit\nsystem‘ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard\nof; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly\nfrom the facility of borrowing.\n―Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the\nbanks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade;\ngreat purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All,\nto be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid\ncapital....\n\n2\n\n\f―Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and\ncredulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example\nof one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n―Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician,\nand the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No ‗operation‘ is thought worthy of\nattention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does\nnot promise an immediate fortune....\n―Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as\nshort as it is brilliant.‖2\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street\nJournal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Lee Cullum in the Dallas Morning News. It\nwas written by Washington Irving in his famous ―Crayon Papers‖ about the Mississippi Bubble\nfiasco of 1719.\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the\nother modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. But he\nunderstood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old\ncolleague called ―irrational exuberance‖ is replaced by irrational fear—when what was a sure\nthing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an\notherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television\nnot long ago was asked what positions he would advise his clients to take to ride out the current\nstorm. He replied ―cash and fetal.‖)\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no\nbusiness appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers\nand begins to weaken.\nSo what have we done about it?\nWell, we could have let nature run its course. P. G. Wodehouse, my favorite comedic author,\nused to say that ―there is only one cure for gray hair. It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called\nthe guillotine.‖ Or we could just ignore it and mandate that it simply not be discussed, as the\nLatvian government has done recently by decreeing that the Security Police arrest any\neconomists who question the security of its banks or the value of its currency (the lat).\nMy colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are red-blooded Americans. We refuse to be\nfatalistic. (Besides, those of us who have hair have seen it turn gray this past year.) We believe in\nthe power of ideas and listen carefully to our critics. And though in normal times, central bankers\nappear to be the most laconic genus of the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the\nmonetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine. We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and\nappropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with\noverwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\n\n2\n\n―A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,‖ by Washington Irving, in The Crayon Papers, 1890.\n3\n\n\fLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the\neconomy‘s lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the early 19th century\nby two men named Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\nBagehot‘s prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: ―The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for its own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities\nof others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‗this man and that man‘ wherever\nthe security is good.‖\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its\ngovernor as follows: ―We lent by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted\nbefore; we took stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on those\nbills, we not only discounted outright but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange\nto an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the\nbank....‖3\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: ―It is by no\nmeans intended to imply that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress that\nthe rashness of bankers [and financiers] may bring upon themselves.... The relief should neither\nbe so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as\ndeeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by\nevery distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their\nstate.‖4\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate\nbetween the need to ―advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and\nmerchants, and ‗to this man and that man‘ whenever the security is good‖ and the equally\ncompelling need to fend off moral hazard of relieving ―those who misconduct their business,‖\nyou might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of\nrecent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours\nof the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the\ntheories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\nI have just finished reading Ken Follett‘s magnificent book World Without End.5 It is a massive\ntome that runs for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the\nBlack Plague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks\nwere the intelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the\ntheorists of ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not\nallowed to attend Oxford, so they learned from doing. 6 While the monks adhered to the Oxfordtaught, old orthodoxy of studying the ―humors,‖ of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat\n3\n\nLombard Street, by Walter Bagehot, 1825.\nAn Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, by Henry Thornton, 1802.\n5\nWorld Without End, by Ken Follett, New York: Penguin, 2007.\n6\nWhen I arrived at Oxford 650 years later, there were women studying there, but they were kept in separate colleges\nand were small in number. The joke among women then was ―Come to Oxford where the odds are good but the\ngoods are odd.‖\n4\n\n4\n\n\fvoluntas tua (―Thy will be done‖), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually\nworked. The punch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place\nis spared the worst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies\nexperience and adapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\nWe at the Federal Reserve have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then some. We have\nbeen neither ―scanty nor slow‖ in addressing the pathology of our economy and financial system.\nWe have ―lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the safety of the bank.‖\nAnd just two days ago, we made clear that despite having reduced the target range for the federal\nfunds rate to between zero and 0.25 percent—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from pursuing\nevery practicable means of supporting the functioning of financial markets and stimulating the\neconomy back to a steady state by employing new techniques that fit the current circumstance.\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient\ndebacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by\nother lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as\nthe Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the\nactions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to\ntheir banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12 of last year, when the base\ninterest rate was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing access to\ncredit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures in the\nsystem.\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We\nestablished a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to\nsecure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major\ntrading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco\nde México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those\nmarkets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the\nU.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain\nbanks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of\nthe financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new\nfacility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto\nloans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; and (8) at\nthe end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct\nobligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500\nbillion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae.\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced\nthe fed funds rate, a process that I fully supported once it became clear that the inflationary tide\nwas ebbing. Simultaneously, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the\nrate it charges banks to borrow from our ―discount window‖ so as to lower their cost of credit.\nThat rate now rests at 0.5 percent.\nAll of this has meant expanding our balance sheet. When I finished Ken Follett‘s book last\nFriday night, the total footings of the Federal Reserve had expanded to $2.254 trillion—an\nalmost three-fold increase from when we started the year. And I believe we made it quite clear in\nour press release after Monday and Tuesday‘s meeting of the FOMC that we stand ready to grow\n5\n\n\four balance sheet even more should conditions warrant. For example, we will expand purchases\nof mortgage-backed securities, should we feel such purchases would be productive.\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our\nbalance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value\nof our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. We feel this is the correct side to\nemphasize. The right side of our balance sheet records our holdings of banks‘ balances, Federal\nReserve Bank notes or cash (currently over $830 billion) and U.S. Treasury balances.\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the right\nside of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash, only to find that accumulation\ndid too little to rejuvenate the system.\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between\ncash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their\nmoney. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and allimportant private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to\naffordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to\nimprove the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In\nthe parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to\n―quantitative easing.‖ It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese\ncounterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others‘ unsuccessful attempts at\ncuring the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla Treasuries as assets and\nby shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few\neyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton\nFriedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devises his protagonist, the felicitously\nnamed Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn\nto Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein,\nit was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B),\nthereby jerking ladle (C), which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting\nperch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens\nand lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut\nstring (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby\nwiping face.\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter\nBagehot or any of the other patron saints of central banking. But these are complex, trying times.\nOur economy faces a tough road. We are the nation‘s central bank and we are duty bound to\napply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial system and\nget back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men and women\nof the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty.\nEven if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\n\n6\n\n\fSome of our innovative contraptions have begun to work. For example, the London interbank\noffered rate, known by its acronym LIBOR, has come down handsomely. This is important as\nmost variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that will be reset in the immediate future are\nbased on LIBOR. Our purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed\nsecurities has reduced the interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages to 5.19 percent, a record\nlow, according to Freddie Mac data that start in 1971. And our commercial paper and money\nmarket fund facilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market.\nYou cannot read a great deal into the initial response to an FOMC meeting. The markets need\ntime to digest the signals being sent, especially when we are declaring a new regime change.\nThat said, I found it encouraging that one of my favorite, well-run companies, Disney, was able\nto issue $1 billion in five-year notes yesterday, priced to yield 4.7 percent—some 30 basis points\nlower than most mavens on Wall Street had expected. If we are successful, issuers of corporate\ndebt should see the cost of debt reduced over time. According to this morning‘s Wall Street\nJournal, the credit-default swaps index, which tracks the cost of insuring against the default of\nhigh-quality, investment-grade bonds, has fallen 16 percent in the past three days. 7 So, so far, so\ngood.\nYet despite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed\nto restore the nation‘s economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and\nspending of federal monies lies with the Congress of the United States, and all eyes are on the\nfiscal stimulus package that will be worked out by the new president and the legislative branch.\nAs a representative only of the monetary authority, I will refrain from commenting on the\nbusiness of the fiscal authorities. With one exception: Whatever they decide to do, it is\nimperative that they withstand demands for protectionism—action that is within their purview as\ncollectors of tariffs and writers of trade legislation. What made the Great Depression regrettably\n―great‖ was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may\nbe less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending\ninstitutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of\nVienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global\ndownturn into a depression that lasted until 1896 was action taken by Chancellor Otto von\nBismarck in 1879 to abandon Germany‘s free trade policy. His actions were followed in quick\nsuccession by France and then by Benjamin Harrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of\n1888 by running on a protectionist platform. As world economic growth slows and economic\nconditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives and newly elected\ncommander-in-chief must resist with every fiber of their political beings the temptation to\ncompound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the economic\nsituation we now are working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\nWith that cautionary note, I think I have said enough, Mr. Mayor. If you wish, I would be happy\nto take questions from the audience—as long as everybody keeps their shoes on.\n\n7\n\n―Sentiment Shifts to Corporate Debt,‖ Wall Street Journal, Dec. 18, 2008.\n7\n\n\f"

        "content": "The Current State of the U.S. Economy\nand the Fed’s Response\n(With Reference to Irrational\nExuberance and Virgil’s Aeneid)\nRemarks before the Texas Cattle Feeders Association\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nGrapevine, Texas\nNovember 4, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Current State of the U.S. Economy and the Fed’s\nResponse (With Reference to Irrational Exuberance\nand Virgil’s Aeneid)\nRichard W. Fisher\nI am a little uncomfortable speaking to cattlemen. It is true that we have a family ranch in East\nTexas—a few thousand acres straddling the Titus and Franklin county lines. We don’t run a feed\nyard, but we did run up to 600 mother cows in our pastures until it finally dawned on us that\ncows graze on dollar bills. We never made a profit from those animals and now simply lease our\ngrazing land to others. So I admit to knowing slim to none about cattle. We do own a couple\ndozen Longhorns, however. For the past few years, we have bred them with a pure, red\nSimmental bull that weighs in at over a ton and have covered our costs by selling the offspring.\nOur bull’s name used to be Mr. T. In honor of Alan Greenspan, I had Mr. T re-registered as\nIrrational Exuberance.\nWhen Chairman Greenspan retired, we had a farewell dinner for him at the Dallas Fed. We had\nhis picture taken alongside a huge poster of our handsome breeder and gave him a lifetime pass\nto come visit our ranch at any time to pet him. About a week later, I received a copy of the photo\non which Alan had inscribed: “Richard—Irrational Exuberance is truly a lot of bull.”\nSimmentals are thought to be docile and easy to manage. Yet they are also known for their\nextreme muscle patterns and leanness. When a 2,000-plus-pound Simmental bull in a pasture full\nof Longhorn cows becomes … uh … exuberant … he is nearly impossible to tame until his\nenergies are spent. An extremely muscular economy and robust financial system like that of the\nUnited States is not all that dissimilar. Academics and armchair pundits may think them easy to\nmanage. Yet, despite all the advances in economic theory and risk management techniques, when\nthe economy and financial markets get too headstrong and frisky, they are hard to rein in.\nEconomists like to say that one of the purposes of a central bank like the Federal Reserve is to\n“tame the animal spirits of the economy,” employing monetary policy to keep the nation on the\npath to sustainable, noninflationary growth. One of the greatest of Federal Reserve chairmen,\nWilliam McChesney Martin, once said that the job of the Fed is “to take away the punch bowl\njust as the party gets going.” As I speak to you today, we are in the midst of experiencing the\nconsequences of the failure to take away the punch bowl and of allowing the exuberant “animal\nspirits” of our economy to get out of hand. We must never allow this to happen again. But first\nwe must deal with the situation at hand. This is what I wish to speak to you about today: our\neconomic predicament and what the Federal Reserve, the nation’s central bank, is doing about it.\nFirst, a little background. Let me read to you what I consider to be the most insightful description\nof what we have just witnessed.\n“Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when\n‘the credit system’ … expands to full luxuriance; everyone trusts everybody; a\n\n1\n\n\fbad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies\nplain and open; and men … dash forward boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n“Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally\ndiscounted at the banks…. Every one … talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard\nbut gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and\nimmense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in\npromise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital….\n“Speculative and dreaming … men … relate their dreams and projects to the\nignorant and credulous, dazzle them with [their] golden visions, and set them\nmaddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another; speculation\nrises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble.…\n“Speculation … renders the [financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a\nregion of enchantment.… No ‘operation’ is thought worthy of attention that does\nnot double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does not\npromise an immediate fortune.…\n“Could this delusion always last, … life … would indeed be a golden dream; but\n[the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.”\nThis was not written in a recent issue of the Wall Street Journal or the Dallas Morning News or\nthe Amarillo Globe-News, the Oklahoman, or the Albuquerque Journal. It was written by\nWashington Irving in 1719 in his famous “Crayon Papers” about the speculative disaster known\nas the Mississippi Bubble.\nI am pretty confident that Washington Irving had never heard of a subprime mortgage or of\nCountrywide Financial, of a credit default swap or Lehman Brothers, multisector collateralized\ndebt obligations or AIG, or any of the other modern financial innovations and agents that have\nproven so vexing to credit markets and financial stability. But he understood booms propelled by\ngreed and tomfoolery and what happens when the “animal spirits” of the markets are allowed to\nrun amok. He did not need a modern-day figure like Warren Buffett to warn that we must\n“beware of geeks bearing formulas.” For common sense told him that eventually, the “short but\nbrilliant” phenomenon of irrational exuberance bursts and is most often replaced by irrational\nfear. What was a sure thing yields to uncertainty; uncertainty undermines decisionmaking; and\nthe confident decisionmaking that is needed to sustain the economy retreats into a defensive\ncrouch. Counterparties come to be viewed with suspicion. No business appears worthy of\nfinancing. Cash is hoarded. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins\nto weaken.\nA fellow interviewed on television the other day was asked what positions he would advise\nviewers to take to ride out the current period of uncertainty. He replied: “Cash and fetal.” It was\na clever description of a debilitating pathology. You can’t grow an economy when financiers are\ncurled up into a ball, clutching dollars for fear they might lose them. With the credit markets\nfrozen, growth gives way to recession, and confidence is displaced by fear. This Sunday, the\n\n2\n\n\fNew York Times reminded us that James Madison said, “The circulation of confidence is better\nthan the circulation of money.” The global economy has been waylaid by a crisis of confidence. 1\nIn late September, the CEO of one of the nation’s largest retailers called me and told me of a\nremarkable conversation his buyers had just had with their biggest supplier, the Chinese. In\npreparing for the upcoming buying season, this retailer—from whom a hefty portion of\nAmerican families buys clothes, shoes, accessories and housewares—had been told earlier this\nyear by his Chinese suppliers that their asking price for women’s apparel would be 8 to 10\npercent higher than last year and shoes would be 15 percent higher, reversing more than a decade\nof price deflation in those consumer products. The retailer had budgeted corresponding price\nincreases in his stores to begin this winter. Yet at that meeting, the buyers were told that the\nChinese suppliers would not only not levy the price increases they had previously insisted upon,\nbut would even discount from 2007’s prices as long as the buyers were creditworthy.\nAs the year progressed, there had been a clear pattern emerging in our economy among our\nnation’s businesses. After a ferocious rush upward of prices—not just of commodities and raw\nmaterials, but also of intermediate and finished inputs produced by increasingly expensive\nChinese and other foreign labor—producers of goods and services were pursuing a textbook\nstrategy to sustain their top lines and protect their margins: They were clamping down on the\ncosts by cutting personnel, running tighter inventories and supply lines, and cutting every\ncontrollable cost. And they were pushing rising input costs into their price structure as much as\nthe market would bear. Thus, we saw a rash of announcements of planned price increases for\neverything from chemicals to diapers to soft drinks to beer to airline fares to rail shipment prices\nto cereals to feed. Even purveyors of electronic services, like Bloomberg, raised prices by\nroughly 6 percent in midsummer. Architects and engineering and other services firms were doing\nlikewise.\nThis microeconomic behavior was reflected in the macroeconomic numbers. Consumer price\nindexes rose, and even the “core” indexes that central bankers use to sort out the underlying\nsignal from the background noise about inflation were coursing upward. In June, headlines of\nmajor newspapers announced that the month-on-month rate for consumer prices had risen at an\nannualized 9.6 percent, while the core rate was reported out at 3.4 percent. Less dramatically, but\nnonetheless ominously, the year-over-year rise in headline consumer price inflation (as measured\nby the PCE) in July was 4½ percent and the core rate, 2½ percent. This is why I was so cautious\nabout endorsing rate cuts: We were at risk of the worst of economic fates—a slowing economy\naccompanied by expectations of rising prices, more popularly known as “stagflation.” Even as\nthe majority of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to lower the benchmark\ninterest rate, and even as we unanimously undertook measures to counter emerging strains on the\ncredit system, the statements that accompanied our policy initiatives repeatedly stressed the\nbalance of risks between growth and inflation. After our meeting of June 25, the FOMC issued a\nstatement to the effect that “although downside risks to growth remain … the upside risks to\ninflation and inflation expectations have risen.” After our August meeting, we noted that\n“inflation has been high … and some indications of inflation expectations have been elevated,”\nadding, however, that “the Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next\nyear.” We repeated that concern in our release on September 16, noting that “inflation has been\nhigh” and “the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.”\n1\n\n“When a Nation Suffers from Poor Circulation,” by Phyllis Korkki, New York Times, Nov. 2, 2008, p. 2.\n3\n\n\fCattle feeders appear to have been equally concerned. I note that your press release of August 7\nexpressed deep concern about the impact of rising corn prices, which had reached $7.65 a bushel\non June 27 before their descent to the present level of $4.\nAs evidenced by the experience of the retailer I cited earlier, the impetus for rising prices came\nto a grinding halt as the credit crisis took grip and confidence evaporated. As the credit market\ncongealed, inflationary momentum froze in its tracks. As October approached, it became\nincreasingly clear that smart businesswomen and -men no longer had the option of seeking to\nprotect their top and bottom lines by seeking price increases for their goods and services. The\nonly option before them quickly became that of running their businesses by aggressively\ntightening their head count of employees, more passionately seeking to cut other costs, and more\nclosely scrutinizing and reining in their capital expenditures. Economists recognize this as\n“procyclical behavior.” It forms a toxic brew when combined with a credit crisis. Just as\nirrational exuberance causes economies to overshoot on the upside, behavioral adaptations driven\nby uncertainty and fear and credit constriction exacerbate the downside.\nSo what has the Federal Reserve done to counter this phenomenon? Remember that we have a\nlimited role. We are the central bank of the United States, not the fiscal authority. We have\navailable a limited number of tools. But we have been deploying them aggressively.\nAgain, some historical context. The basic manual for a central bank’s response to a panic was\nwritten in the early 19th century by two Englishmen, Walter Bagehot and Henry Thorton.\nBagehot’s prescription to counter a panic was as follows: “The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the\nliabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‘this man and that man’\nwhenever the security is good.” He wrote of how, during the Panic of 1825, the Bank of England\n“lent by every possible means and in modes … never adopted before.” Also bearing in mind the\nadvice of Thorton, who in 1802 wrote that “it is by no means intended to imply that it would\nbecome the (Central) Bank to relieve every distress which the rashness of (financiers) may bring\nupon themselves…. The relief should neither be so … liberal as to exempt those who misconduct\ntheir business … nor so scanty and slow as deeply to involve the general interests. These\ninterests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every distressed person whose affairs are large,\nhowever indifferent or ruinous may be their state.”\nCentral bankers are generally considered the most laconic genus of the human species. Yet, in\nresponse to this crisis, the Federal Reserve reacted like Bagehot on steroids. We have not quite\nlent “to this man and that man.” But beginning with the announcement on December 12 of last\nyear of our term auction facility, we have reached deep into our tool kit to “lend by every\npossible means and in modes … never adopted before.” We have been neither “scanty” nor\n“slow.” In rapid order, the Federal Reserve has stretched out the terms with which we lend to\nbankers; accepted new forms of collateral; broadened access to our lending window to securities\ndealers and one particular insurance company—AIG—whose failure was deemed by the Federal\nReserve Board to present a risk to the financial system; opened a window for financing\ncommercial paper; backstopped money market mutual funds; and, recognizing that we are\ninextricably interwoven with a global economy, established swap lines to help meet the dollarfunding needs of 14 central banks, ranging from the European Central Bank and the Bank of\nEngland to the Banco de México and the Singapore Monetary Authority, the total of which now\n4\n\n\faggregates to hundreds of billions of dollars. And our staff and policymakers have provided\nsubstantial intellectual input into activities of other regulators, such as the FDIC and the\nTreasury, as they develop innovative means and modes of recapitalizing the banking system,\ndealing with the mortgage crisis and restoring economic growth .\nYou can see the size and breadth of the Fed’s efforts to counter the collapse of the credit\nmechanism in our balance sheet. At the beginning of this year, the assets on the books of the Fed\ntotaled $960 billion. Today, our assets exceed $1.9 trillion. I would not be surprised to see them\naggregate to $3 trillion—roughly 20 percent of GDP—by the time we ring in the New Year. The\ncomposition of our holdings has shifted considerably. Previously, almost 100 percent of our\nholdings were in the form of core holdings of U.S. Treasuries; today, less than a third are. The\nremainder consists of claims deriving from our new facilities.\nThis combination of measures, together with an effective fed funds rate of less than 1 percent, is\nunprecedented. We believe they are a necessary antidote to what ails the economy and a needed\nimpetus for the restoration of confidence.\nBut we also know that there are limits to what the central bank can do. Our efforts must be\ncomplemented by fiscal policy and by initiatives undertaken by other regulators. And we also\nknow that it will take time before confidence is re-established.\nI don’t know how many of you have read Virgil’s Aeneid. It tells the story of the epic voyage in\nwhich Aeneas is tested by all kinds of temptation and fury, dispossession and defeat, torment\nand, eventually, triumph as he crosses stormy seas to seek the city from which Rome will\neventually be founded. One of the great tests of Aeneas’ will comes when he attempts to cross\nthe Tuscan Sea. Juno, the queen of the gods, asks Aeolus, the god of the winds, to whip up the\nmother of all storms to stop Aeneas’ fleet. Neptune, the god of the sea, comes to the rescue, and\nas described by Virgil, he saves the day. He: “calms the heaving seas, putting the clouds to rout\nand bringing back the sun … clearing a channel through the deadly reefs, his chariot skimming\nover the cresting waves on spinning wheels to set the seas to rest.”\nAnd Virgil goes on to declare: “Just as, all too often, some huge crowd is seized by a vast\nuprising, the rabble runs amok, all slaves to passion, rocks and firebrands flying … but then, if\nthey chance to see a man among them, one whose devotion and public service lend him weight,\nthey stand there, stock-still with their ears alert as he rules their furor with his words and calms\ntheir passion. So the crash of the breakers all fell silent once [Neptune], gazing over his realm\nunder clear skies, flicks his horses, giving them free rein, and his eager chariot flies.”\nIf it were only so easy to turn around an economy that is now geared to the downside with a kind\nof turbulent ferocity that seems to equal, if not better, the powerful tailwinds that drove both the\nUnited States economy and the rest of the world on its upward slope of growth. Such growth was\nthe product of exuberant financial markets running “amok, all slaves to passion, rocks and\nfirebrands flying” in the pursuit of the ever greater returns made possible by the end of the Cold\nWar, the death of Mao, the triumph of capitalism, the onset of globalization, and the speed with\nwhich the Internet and modern technology have accelerated financial calculation and economic\ndevelopment.\n\n5\n\n\fA reader of the Aeneid will recall that after the storm that I just described, “Aeneas puts in with a\nbare seven warships saved from his whole fleet.” 2 And this is but Book One of Virgil’s epic\npoem. Aeneas’ ultimate victory does not come until 11 books later.\nThere is no modern counterpart to a Neptune who will rise from the depths and “chariot spinning\n… set the seas to rest.” The task of restoring the credit markets, instilling confidence and righting\nour economy ship will take many hands. I have described to you the initiatives undertaken by\nyour central bank—by the Federal Reserve—to calm the tempest that is upon us. Complementary\naction must now be undertaken by the fiscal authorities—by the Congress in cooperation with a\nnew president who will be elected by the American people today. It was not to distract you that I\nspoke of the Aeneid. Despite the efforts of the Fed, the hope that comes with a new presidency,\nand what will hopefully be responsible and carefully calibrated fiscal initiatives for the Congress,\nI believe we have an epic challenge ahead of us. We are navigating the mother of all financial\nstorms. We will certainly come out of it with a lesser number of ships than we entered it with, for\nwe cannot and should not “relieve the rashness of distress that financiers” and other imprudent\ndecisionmakers “have brought upon themselves.” And we know that that reduced fleet will face\nmany challenges before it reaches the safe harbor of prosperous economic growth.\nBut this much I know: We have been here before and we have overcome our problems. We are a\nnation of risk takers. Often we confront storms of our own making. We falter. We get blown off\ncourse. We lose some of our ships. But we never give up. We are a resilient people. We always\ncome roaring back, recovering from our setbacks with an even more extreme muscle pattern and\na leanness that would put that hearty bull that roams our pasture in Mount Vernon to shame. You\ndon’t have to be irrationally exuberant to know that that is what makes America unique.\nAnd always will.\nThank you.\n\n2\n\nThe sections quoted are from Book One, lines 167 through 200, of Virgil’s The Aeneid, as translated by Robert\nFagles, Viking Penguin Press, 2006.\n\n6\n\n\f"

        "content": "Addressing a Credit Crisis\nRemarks before the International Institute of Finance\nAnnual Membership Meeting\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 12, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fAddressing a Credit Crisis\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Bill [Rhodes].\nI have been wondering why Charles Dallara asked me to join this distinguished panel of\npresenters this morning.\nPerhaps it was because in the convenient lexicon of the press I am viewed as among the FOMC’s\nmost outspoken inflation “hawks” and have of late made clear that the dynamics of price\nmovements have shifted and been overpowered by the implosion of the credit mechanism.\nOr perhaps it is because I hail from the strongest economic region within the United States.\nTexas has an economy that is larger than India’s, created roughly 30 percent of all private sector\njobs in America last year, expects to have employment growth of around 1.5 percent this year\ndespite the slowing of the national and international economies into which it sells, is the\ncountry’s second-largest manufacturing center, is the largest exporting state and was singled out\nby the Financial Times on Friday as enjoying “the best” economic situation in the U.S.\nSo Charles may have wanted to present me as a curiosity. Or he may have wanted to remind\nthose of you who in your trips to the United States never venture outside the narrow Boston–\nNew York–Washington corridor that this vast American economic machine still has pistons that\nare pumping and entrepreneurs and financiers who refuse to be trapped in the conventions of the\npast and instead view the current markets’ turmoil as an opportunity that occasionally presents\nitself through the painful but inexorable process of “Schumpeterian creative destruction.”\nOr, perhaps more likely, it was simply because he may have confused me with my prestigious\ncentral banking namesake, Stanley Fischer, a towering intellect and most clever man.\nIt was Stan Fischer who a couple of years ago at Jackson Hole quipped that there are three kinds\nof economists: those that can count and those that cannot.\nSome would say that Stan Fischer’s little quip might best apply today to bankers and regulators\nwho, in the zeal to quantify risk and econometricize decisionmaking, abandoned rudimentary\nmath and forgot the basics that anchor credit and money and banking.\nLet me read you a description of fiduciary amnesia, written by one of the shrewdest of financial\nmarket observers:\n“Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons,\nwhen ‘the credit system’ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts\neverybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and\nsudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly from the\nfacility of borrowing.\n\n1\n\n\f“Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are\nliberally discounted at the banks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts];\nnothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales\nof real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be\nsure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the\naggregate as solid capital....\n“Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to\nthe ignorant and credulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them\nmaddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another;\nspeculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n“Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the\n[financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a region of\nenchantment.... No ‘operation’ is thought worthy of attention that does not\ndouble or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does\nnot promise an immediate fortune….\n“Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream;\nbut [the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.”\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street\nJournal or David Brooks of the New York Times, or their counterparts at LeMonde or the\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung or the Straits Times or Reforma or O Globo or the Daily Mail\nand Guardian in Johannesburg (whose headline today was “Without Real Leadership, We Face\nFinancial Disaster”). It was written by Washington Irving in his famous “Crayon Papers” about\nthe Mississippi Bubble fiasco of 1719.\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or an SIV or a credit default swap or\nother modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. But he\nunderstood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old\ncolleague called “irrational exuberance” is replaced by irrational fear: What was a sure thing\nyields to uncertainty; uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking; and the\ndecisionmaking that ordinarily keeps the credit system robust retreats into a defensive crouch. (A\nfellow being interviewed on television the other day was asked what position he would advise\nhis clients to take to ride out the current storm, and he replied: “Cash and fetal.”)\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion, and no\nbusiness appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers\nand begins to weaken.\nSo what have we done about it?\nThe Federal Reserve is the central bank of the most powerful and dynamic economy in the\nworld. It is the lender of last resort for that colossal economy. The behavior of the classic lender\nof last resort in the current circumstance is also etched in the history books, and it is well worth\nremembering.\n2\n\n\fHenry Thorton and Walter Bagehot articulated it early in the 19th century.\nBagehot’s prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: “The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for its own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities\nof others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‘this man and that man’ wherever\nthe security is good.”\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its\ngovernor as follows: “We lent by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted\nbefore; we took stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on those\nbills, we not only discounted outright but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange\nto an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the\nbank....”\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Henry Thorton, writing in 1802: “It is by\nno means intended to imply that it would become the (Central) Bank to relieve every distress that\nthe rashness of bankers (and financiers) may bring upon themselves.... The relief should neither\nbe so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as\ndeeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by\nevery distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their\nstate.”\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate\nbetween the need to “advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and\nmerchants, and ‘to this man and that man’ wherever the security is good” and the equally\ncompelling need to fend off moral hazard of relieving “those who misconduct their business,”\nyou might dust off your Bagehot and Thorton.\nCentral bankers are ordinarily considered the most laconic genus of the human species. Not so in\na time of crisis. I would submit to you that the Federal Reserve under the chairmanship of Ben\nBernanke has wasted no time and left no stone unturned in addressing the current crisis. We have\n“lent by every possible means and in modes we have never adopted before” “consistent with the\nsafety of the Bank.” We have neither been “scant” nor “slow.”\nYesterday, Roger Coles walked you through the rapid-fire steps we have taken at the Federal\nReserve. Phillip, throw up that chart of the growth of our balance sheet. This picture says a lot:\nThe assets on the books of the Fed are now close to $1.6 trillion. In December of last year, they\nwere only $890 billion.\nYou will notice the dramatic difference in the composition of the assets held by the System. At\nthe beginning of the year, we were almost 100 percent in Treasury securities; now “other assets”\nand “term auction credit” represent roughly one-third or some $500 billion in our total assets.\nThis reflects what I consider one of the most significant strides taken to address perhaps the most\ndebilitating pathology of a credit crunch. I refer to “rollover risk.” When counterparties are\nunwilling to engage one another for fear that regardless of price, a borrower will not be able to\nroll over a loan to another source of funds, the credit markets cease to operate. Suppose Charles,\nfor example, thinks Richard is creditworthy. But the certainty that Bill might replace that loan to\nRichard when it comes due to Charles is suspect. Charles becomes reluctant to lend to Richard in\n3\n\n\fthe first place for fear that Richard will be unable to roll over his debt to Charles to Bill. The\nresult is that no one lends to Richard at all, even if he is creditworthy in Charles’ eyes. Thus our\nrecent initiatives to provide a backstop for funding banks, primary dealers and commercial paper\nissuers. By providing a backstop source of funding, the Fed seeks to lower or eliminate rollover\nrisk. Charles no longer worries about what Bill might think of Richard as a borrower because he\nknows he will be repaid by Richard's going to the Fed for a loan.\nThe Fed will do whatever it needs to do to be a credible backstop in support of the credit system.\nIt is traditional for Reserve Bank presidents and governors to proffer only their personal views\nand never speak for any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee. This morning, I\nam casting that convention aside. I believe I can safely speak for us all when I tell you that the\nFederal Reserve will continue to explore every avenue and consider every option to see the credit\nmarket through the current crisis, consistent with the safety of the System. We will provide the\nleadership called for by the Daily Mail and Guardian of Johannesburg and others.\nOf course, we know that we cannot go it alone. At home, our work must complement the work of\nthe fiscal authorities as they seek to recapitalize the banking system and reconfigure our\nregulatory system. Thus we are working hand-in-glove with the Treasury, which has facilitated\nthe growth of our balance sheet, enabling us to keep credit flowing in the face of the seizing up\nof interbank lending and of the commercial paper market.\nWe live in a globalized world, and as evidenced by the expansion of swap lines with nine of our\ncounterparts and by the recent coordinated rate cut, we will continue to explore appropriate\npolicy responses that can be enacted without detriment to others but instead to the benefit of all.\nIn the end, there is only so much that the Federal Reserve or any other central bank, even acting\nin unison with each other and with fiscal authorities, can do. I believe we can and we will restore\norder to the credit markets and that the fiscal authorities led by Secretary [Henry] Paulson and\nthe Congress will engineer an appropriate recapitalization of the banking system in a manner that\ndoes not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs of the practice of capitalism that has made for\nthe powerful economic machine of America. That does not mean that we can undo in short order\nthe damage that has been done to confidence on Main Street—in the real sector of the economy\nwhere jobs are created and innovation and progress are realized. Contrition for the misbehavior\nof the financial sector and the realization that we have lived for too long too high on the\nambrosia of money compliantly advanced by overly eager lenders at home and abroad—that, to\ngo back to Washington Irving, our “delusion” could not “always last”—will likely be manifest in\na painful period of adjustment and subpar or even negative growth for some time, probably well\ninto 2009. But properly managed, a task to which my colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I\nwill devote every ounce of our collective energy, need not—indeed must not—result in the dire\nscenarios being bandied about by economics Cassandras.\nAs we navigate our way through this difficult patch, we would do well to heed the advice of\nMarcus Nadler, a former chief of the Foreign Division of the Federal Reserve’s Board of\nGovernors:\nYou’re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to\nexpand;\n4\n\n\fYou’re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse;\nYou’re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to\nruin or wreck the country;\nYou’re right if you bet that men in business, labor and government are\nsane, reasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on\nto find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work out\na compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.\nThese four propositions—what is now known as “Old Doc Nadler’s Remedy”—were not written\nfor some political campaign or for a recent edition of USA Today. They were crafted some 70\nyears ago by one of the world’s foremost economists to counter the down-in-the-mouth\npessimism that gripped our financial system in the 1930s. They serve as a gentle reminder that\nwe should never discount the unfailing ability of the American entrepreneur and thoughtful\ngovernment officials to solve our most complex problems—even those that plague us today.\n\n5\n\n\f"

        "content": "Responding to Turbulence\n(With Reference to Bob Dylan,\nAlan Brooke, Washington Irving,\nAnna Fisher and Marcus Nadler)\nRemarks before the Money Marketeers of New York University\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nNew York City\nSeptember 25, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fResponding to Turbulence\n(With Reference to Bob Dylan, Alan Brooke, Washington Irving,\nAnna Fisher and Marcus Nadler)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, John [Partlan].\nI haven’t been in these rooms for some 30 years. The Downtown Association used to be a haunt\nof some of the partners of the firm where I started my career—the venerable, now 190-year-old\nand still-thriving private bank, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. I went to work there for the\nlegendary Robert Roosa after graduating from Stanford Business School in 1975. He and the\npartners of Brown Brothers taught me money and banking and provided me the analytical\ntraining and insights that made for whatever successes I have had, including the investment\nperformance record cited by John in his kind introduction.\nMost important, it was Mr. Roosa, God rest his magnanimous soul, who set me on the path that\nled to the Federal Reserve. He had played a signal role in the development of the New York\nFed’s operations and later served with great distinction as President Kennedy’s undersecretary of\nthe Treasury before joining Brown Brothers. During his long career, he mentored many good\nmen—from Paul Volcker, who was his deputy at Treasury, to Mike Long, who became a key\ngeneral partner at Brown Brothers and whom I am very honored to see here tonight, to a few\nlesser characters like me. All of us take pride in having been members of a small fraternity that\nwas very much “sub-Roosa.”\nThat was then; this is now. Little about the fraternity I currently belong to—the Federal Reserve\nSystem—is sub-rosa, or secretive. Chairman Ben Bernanke has just completed two days of\ntestimony before Congress, and I doubt anything I can say tonight will be any more\ncomprehensive than what you heard from him these past two days. So I will make little effort,\nneither in this speech nor the Q&A that follows, to review or amplify upon the chairman’s\ntestimony. Instead, I am going to focus my comments predominantly on monetary policy, the\nbedrock mission of the Federal Reserve System. As always, the views I will express this evening\nare my own and not those of any other participant in the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or the Federal Reserve.\nAs I was preparing this speech against the background of recent fast-moving events in the\nfinancial markets, I couldn’t help but think of Bob Dylan’s song “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only\nBleeding).” 1 One of my favorite lyrics in that song is: “Money doesn’t talk, it swears.” Financial\ninstitutions have been bleeding, and the markets have been cussing up a blue streak lately. So I\nthought I would share with you tonight some perspectives on where we have been, what we have\ndone, where we are now and where this might lead us.\nLet me begin by reviewing where we have been on monetary policy by dispatching the excessive\nattention that has been given to my dissenting votes this year on the Federal Open Market\n1\n\n“It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding),” by Bob Dylan, Bringing It All Back Home, 1965.\n1\n\n\fCommittee. The morning after our meeting on Sept. 16, the headline in the business section of\nthe world’s most important daily … The Dallas Morning News … read as follows: “Bernanke,\nFed Colleagues Decide to Keep Rates Steady; Even Dallas’ Fisher Concurs.” 2\nThe less parochial among you may have read Hong Kong’s Asia Times on Sept. 18, which had\nthis gem of an analysis on the meeting: “Like an old-time cowboy, [Ben Bernanke]’s got all his\n‘little doggies’ back into the pen. Dallas Federal Reserve [Bank] president Richard Fisher, the\nleader of an anti-Bernanke insurgency calling for higher interest rates to fight inflation since\nspring, fell in line this time with the rate hold [at 2 percent], making the statement unanimous.”\nTo which the writer appended: “… if the choice was between the health of the economy and the\nrestoration of Bernanke’s authority, it seems that the economy got the nasty end of the stick.” 3\nI am not sure what was meant by that last clause about the end of the stick. But I can tell you\nthis: Ben Bernanke, whose authority as chairman has never been in question, is no cowboy. And\nI am no “doggie” (though our family does own a handsome herd of Longhorns and a fine\nbreeding bull named, incidentally, Irrational Exuberance; I consider these noble animals, so the\nterm in itself is hardly insulting). Nor am I a member of, yet alone a leader within, what some\ncynical writer imagines is an “anti-Bernanke insurgency.” I am a member of a group of earnest\npolicymakers, which includes the chairman, that places the health of the economy and the proper\nconduct of monetary policy above any personal interests or intrigue.\nThe FOMC met on Sept. 16, the day after the Lehman announcement and as the New York Fed\nwas wrestling with AIG. As we prepared to meet, fed funds were trading at up to 5 and 6 percent,\ntriple the targeted level, even as the open market desk was injecting prodigious amounts of\nliquidity into the system. And we met on the eve of some $89 billion in one day’s withdrawals\nfrom money market funds. The problem was clearly not the fed funds rate target. A rate cut was\nnot, and is not, the cure for an economy where many banks cannot expand their balance sheets,\nor must shrink their balance sheets, because of capital constraints. The case for a rate rise seemed\nboth less urgent and potentially disruptive given the clear and present danger of an imploding\nfinancial system and the considerable downside risks to the economy should that implosion\noccur. This “little doggie” entered the pen not because Ben Bernanke or anybody else had herded\nme there. Rather, I did so because I felt, as others at the table did, that holding the fed funds rate\nsteady at 2 percent was the right thing to do while our colleagues at the New York Fed and at the\nTreasury turned to dealing with the risk of AIG and other choke points in the markets.\nThis does not mean that I or anybody else at the table have abandoned our primary job as central\nbankers to deliver upon our mandate to provide the monetary conditions for maximum\nsustainable noninflationary employment growth. We do our duty when we vote with that\nmandate in mind, even if it means not satisfying the pundits or market operators who wish for us\nto accommodate their more immediate needs.\nI take this charge very seriously, as does every other member of the committee. If the author of\nthat Asia Times article, or any of you, wishes to place in perspective my votes—or those of\nCharlie Plosser of the Philadelphia Fed or Bill Poole of St. Louis, or those last year of the Boston\n2\n\n“Holding the Line: Bernanke, Fed Colleagues Decide to Keep Rates Steady; Even Dallas’ Fisher Concurs,” The\nDallas Morning News, Sept. 17, 2008, p. 1D.\n3\n“Ben First, Economy Last,” by Julian Delasantellis, Asia Times, Sept. 18, 2008.\n2\n\n\fFed’s Eric Rosengren or the Kansas City Fed’s Tom Hoenig or any other member of the\nFOMC 4 —he might benefit from reading Andrew Roberts’ magnificent new book, Masters and\nCommanders. It tells the story of Churchill and Roosevelt and their top aides as they sought to\nnegotiate the Second World War. Sir Alan Brooke was Churchill’s equivalent to Roosevelt’s\nGen. George Marshall. On more than one occasion, Brooke openly refused to fall into line with\nChurchill, and often articulated arguments that differed from the consensus of the war cabinet\nmeetings. A critic considered him an insurgent and told him so, saying that it would appear that\nhe might not hold the prime minister in highest regard. To which Brooke replied: “I adore him\ntremendously … but the day that I say I agree with him when I don’t is the day he must get rid of\nme because I am of no use to him anymore.”\nIn a committee such as the FOMC, the best service a member can render is to show his or her\naffection for the institution, its members and especially for its chairman by calling it as he or she\nsees it.\nIn my view, the situation this year has been as follows:\nSince the beginning of the year, I have been worried about the efficacy of reducing the fed funds\nrate given the problems of liquidity and capital constraints afflicting the financial system. As I\nsee it, the seizures and convulsions we have experienced in the debt and equity markets have\nbeen the consequences of a sustained orgy of excess and reckless behavior, not a too-tight\nmonetary policy.\nThere is no nice way to say this, so I will be blunt: Our credit markets had contracted a hideous\nSTD—a securitization transmitted disease—for which lowering the funds rate to negative real\nlevels seemed to me to be not only an ineffective treatment, but a palliative and maybe even a\nstimulus that would only encourage further mischief.\nI was and I remain skeptical that lowering the fed funds rate is the most effective antidote for\nsuch a pathology, given that, in my book, rates held too low, too long during the previous Fed\nregime were an accomplice to that reckless behavior. A fed funds rate of around 3 1/2 percent—\nthat was the level at which I began to stray from “the pen”—did not appear to me to be the\nprincipal problem, particularly with commodities prices soaring and incipient inflation coming to\nour shores from demand-pull pressures and rising labor costs in the countries that we use to\nsource the inputs needed to run our manufacturing base and stock the shelves of our retail stores.\nI would be happy to go into further detail during the Q&A period about my concerns this past\nyear for the risk of inflation “pass through.” Again, that was then; this is now. But we certainly\nwere seeing it continue as we entered the third quarter, even as the financial crisis was reaching a\ncrescendo. On Sept. 5, almost at the moment the Treasury announced it had taken Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac into conservatorship and the stock market had once again turned dyspeptic\nfrom fears of an economic slowdown, the customers of Georgia-Pacific woke up to find a note\ndated Sept. 4: “Please be advised that the Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP is increasing\n4\n\nPresident Plosser voted against the majority on March 18 and April 30. President Poole voted against the majority\non Jan. 22, 2008. President Rosengren cast a dissenting vote on Dec. 11, 2007. President Hoenig cast a dissenting\nvote on Oct. 31, 2007. All voting records are publicly available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n3\n\n\fprices up to 10% with selected items increasing more than 10%, on commercial towel, tissue,\nnapkins, wipers, dispensers, soap, aire [sic], and specialty products due to continued cost\nincreases…. Orders shipped on or after Monday, December 1, 2008, regardless of order date will\nbe invoiced at the new prices.” 5\nOn the day that notice was mailed to Georgia-Pacific’s customers, oil had fallen to $106.23 after\npeaking at $145.66 on July 11, the dollar had rallied to $1.42 on the euro from $1.60 over the\nsame period, and the benchmark Goldman Sachs commodity index overall had come off a July\nhigh of 473.97 to close at 374.55. I single out this interestingly timed notice to illustrate a\nbroader phenomenon of well-managed companies determined to preserve their margins after\nyears of upward-creeping cost pressures, despite the retrenchment of commodity prices. I suspect\nthat this risk, while muted, still lingers. Only days after the FOMC met on the 16th, FedEx, for\nexample, announced that its “U.S. express-delivery unit would raise its shipping rates by an\naverage of 6.9 percent in January.” 6\nBut I digress. The problem that has been ailing capital markets and, by extension, the economy\nhas not been the fed funds rate. It has been and remains risk aversion and uncertainty about\ncounterparty risk and capital adequacy.\nIt may be useful to review the emergency initiatives taken by the Federal Reserve as the\nhemorrhaging patient was being rushed into the ER:\nFirst, there was the administration of various emergency efforts to stabilize the situation. The\nFederal Reserve created three new facilities: the TAF, or term auction facility; the TSLF, or term\nsecurities lending facility; and the PDCF, or primary dealers credit facility. We used these\nimprovised devices to intravenously inject liquidity in amounts and on terms that were\nunprecedented.\nWe worked with other “ERs” as we saw the infection spread and take on global dimensions. We\nestablished and expanded our swap lines with the Europeans and the British and the Swiss and\nthe Canadians and the Japanese (and just this week with the Norwegians, Swedes, Aussies and\nDanes). Together, these central banks injected sizable amounts of liquidity to satisfy dollar\ndemand in their respective home markets.\nAnd, working with the Treasury, we cauterized certain blood vessels that seemed to burst almost\nspontaneously and threaten the system, like Bear Stearns and AIG and debilitated money market\nfunds.\nMeanwhile, other responders were at work—from the Federal Housing Administration, to the\nFederal Home Loan Banks, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the Treasury, to the\nCongress. As they collectively sought to contain the disease, they applied emergency treatments\nranging from extending lines of credit, to constricting short selling, to easing capital\nrequirements, to putting the government-sponsored enterprises into conservatorship, to\n\n5\n\nLetter addressed “Dear Valued Customer,” by Dennis B. Shearer, vice president, commercial sales, GeorgiaPacific Consumer Products LP, Sept. 4, 2008.\n6\n“FedEx Delivers Plan to Weather Downturn,” by Justin Baer, Financial Times, Sept. 19, 2008, p. 20.\n4\n\n\fnegotiating the dissolution of iconic financial institutions, to backstopping money market mutual\nfunds, to passing bills to support these various piecemeal efforts.\nThese various efforts were reactive responses. They were as deliberately and thoughtfully crafted\nand administered as they could be under the unusual and exigent circumstances. But they were\nnecessarily ad hoc. We were fast reaching a point where a more comprehensive, coordinated\nsolution was needed. Given that you are all New Yorkers, I am sure you read the Sunday Times.\nSo I am not divulging any great secrets in saying that Ben Bernanke, a careful student of the\nDepression of the 1930s and other crises, had long been warning the secretary of the Treasury\nand others that a more comprehensive solution might be required. 7 He pressed especially hard on\nthis front after the events surrounding our last FOMC meeting. You know the outcome: A\nproposal by the Treasury was sent to Congress Saturday, and both the secretary and the chairman\nhave been reviewing the merits of the proposed “package” with Congress these past few days.\nSo now a proposal has been made to isolate and quarantine the principal source of this debacle,\nthe toxic mortgage and mortgage-related bacteria, by placing it under a TARP, or “Troubled\nAsset Relief Program.” All parties have recognized that this proposal entails risk, not least of\nwhich is that every lobby will seek to sweep other festering sores—from credit card receivables\nto auto loans—under the TARP. The president of the United States summed up the sense of\nurgency last night in no uncertain terms.\nAs you heard Chairman Bernanke testify, the key strategy in the Treasury proposal is that by\ngathering these distressed assets under the TARP and auctioning them off in a prudent manner,\nsomething closer to a “hold to maturity” price, rather than a panic-based “fire sale” price, can be\ndetermined. This process would give banks a basis for marking their portfolios to a more realistic\nlevel, allowing them to clear the air and stabilize their capital base. By removing diseased\nmortgages and curing the credit market patient, creditors can begin getting back to the business\nof funding commerce and economic growth.\nOne could make the argument that isolating the infected assets that were the most active sources\nof contagion is a necessary but still insufficient condition for restoring a healthy credit system.\nThat argument would suggest that once the TARP, or whatever comes of it, passes through the\npolitical process and debilitating toxic assets are removed from balance sheets, we must next go\nabout buttressing the equity side of the balance sheets of the system’s key agents. I believe that\nafter something along the lines of the Treasury proposal is enacted, that is the next task. The\nStreet and the authorities must put their shoulders to the wheel, and I will be interested in hearing\nyour ideas about how this might be accomplished.\nEven before tackling the task of cementing capital adequacy, we need to bear in mind that the\nTARP places one more straw on the back of the frightfully encumbered camel that is the federal\ngovernment ledger. Other off-balance-sheet liabilities were already in place before Washington\ntook on additional burdens from the reorganization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and\nwhatever we realize—which may, after all is said and done, be a positive return—from the\nliquidation of collateralized loans made through the Fed to Bear Stearns and AIG, and now the\nTreasury’s discharging of “x” dollars of mortgage-related securities for which there is presently\n7\n\n“A Professor and a Banker Bury Old Dogma on Markets,” by Peter Baker, New York Times, Sept. 21, 2008,\nwww.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21paulson.html.\n5\n\n\fno palpable market. (I say “x” because under the proposal made, the taxpayers’ outlay is not\n$700 billion; it is the difference between $700 billion and the return earned on that $700 billion\ninvestment.)\nForemost among the existing liabilities are some $13 trillion in unfunded Social Security benefits\nand Medicare obligations already promised to the people but as yet unfunded, an obligation that\nthe Dallas Fed staff estimates at a present value of over $80 trillion.8 The former comptroller\ngeneral of the United States, David Walker, estimates the Medicare deficit to be less, only $34\ntrillion, so let’s work with his less-excitable numbers. With everything including Social Security\nand Medicare properly accounted for, Mr. Walker estimates that “as of September 30, 2007, the\nfederal government was in a $53 trillion fiscal hole, equal to $455,000 per household and\n$175,000 per person.” 9\nWe are deeply submerged in a vast fiscal chasm. Which begs the question: Is it possible, now\nthat so many distinguished senators and congressmen are proclaiming their concerns for the price\ntag of the Treasury proposal and are ardently defending the interests of the taxpayer, that one of\nthe outcomes of this debate will be that Congress, which alone has the power to tax and spend,\nwill finally face up to the task of squaring the nation’s books?\nJohn Plender, writing in the weekend edition of the Financial Times, reminded us of economist\nHyman Minsky’s dictum that fiscal activism and last-resort loans more often than not set the\nstage for serious inflation. 10\nWhether or not Minsky is right depends in part on those who have the power to tax and spend the\npeople’s money. They can use this crisis as a call to arms for coming to grips with our fiscal\npredicament, or they can punt by asking our children and their children to do what they cannot\nbring themselves to do. Or, just as awful, they can turn to the Fed to print their way out of their\ndilemma and encumber future generations of Americans with the debilitating burden of debased\nmoney.\nTwo weeks ago, I was blessed with the birth of a grandchild. Her name is Anna. For Anna’s\nsake, I pray that those with the power of the purse will take the high road and come to grips with\nour nation’s fiscal predicament either through deft management or enlightened fiscal initiatives.\nAnd I pray that Congress will resist the temptation to hinder the Federal Reserve’s independence\nand instead allow us to implement policy unencumbered by political exigency. For if they don’t\nand the people who deliberate monetary policy in the Fed’s hallowed halls are no longer able to\ndo their Alan Brooke-ian best to tell it like it is and act accordingly to provide the monetary\nconditions for sustainable noninflationary growth, I will fear for Anna’s future.\nVery serious matters are before us, and they require the most thoughtful responses from all\nparties concerned—from the Fed, to the administration, to the ultimate representatives of the\npeople, the Congress. Mind you, this is not the first time that the capital markets have forgotten\n8\n\n“Storms on the Horizon,” by Richard W.

Consider this description of what we\nhave experienced:\n“Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive\nseasons, when ‘the credit system’ … expands to full luxuriance:\neverybody trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad\nway to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men are\ntempted to dash forward boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n“Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are\nliberally discounted at the banks…. Every one now talks in [bodacious\namounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great\npurchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at\nevery transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer\nin promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital.…\n“Now is the time for speculative and dreaming or designing men. They\nrelate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, dazzle\nthem with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The\nexample of one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation;\nbubble rises on bubble; every one helps … to swell the windy\nsuperstructure.…\n“Speculation is the romance of trade, and casts contempt upon all its\nsober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician, and the Exchange a\nregion of enchantment.… No ‘operation’ is thought worthy of attention\nthat does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth\nfollowing that does not promise an immediate fortune.… The\nsubterranean garden of Aladdin is nothing to the realms of wealth that\nbreak upon [the] imagination.\n“Could this delusion always last, … life … would indeed be a golden\ndream; but it is as short as it is brilliant.” 11\n\nThat was not recently written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or David Brooks of the\nNew York Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal. It was written by Washington Irving in\nhis famous Crayon Papers about John Law’s “Mississippi Bubble” fiasco of 1719. Irving had\nnever heard of a subprime mortgage or an Alt-A loan, an SIV, a CDS, a CLO or a CMO. But he\nunderstood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and busts born of fear, and that these\nunderlying forces are deeply rooted in human DNA.\nIf this is a DNA issue, perhaps no financial system—no matter how enlightened its central bank\nor sophisticated its regulatory architecture or wise its Congress or executive—can prevent nature\nfrom running its course. Still, our country is the most advanced in the world. We have been at the\nforefront of innovation and structural advancement in biology and science and technology, in\n11\n\n“A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,” by Washington Irving, in The Crayon Papers, 1890.\n7\n\n\fculture and management and commerce and countless other fields. We must continually strive to\nbe at the forefront of figuring out how to corral the “little doggies” that are the financial markets’\nanimal spirits in a way that encourages them to work their magic of underwriting prosperity and\nyet discourages their straying from the pasture. This is not an easy thing to do. But if we want to\npreserve our way of life, and do what is right for Anna and future generations of Americans, we\nmust get it done.\nLet me wrap up this long monologue by going back to the origins of this club. At times like this,\nit is easy to become melancholy and bitter and cynical. This club, the Money Marketeers, was\nfounded by Marcus Nadler, one of John’s and my predecessors at the Federal Reserve who was\nthere “at the creation.” You will remember that Nadler put forth four simple propositions to\ncounter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial\nindustry after the Crash of ’29:\n“You’re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to\nexpand;\n“You’re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse;\n“You’re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to\nruin or wreck the country;\n“You’re right if you bet that men in business, labor, and government are\nsane, reasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted\non to find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work\nout a compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.”\nThis became known as “Old Doc Nadler’s Remedy,” and for my part, it is spot on. Every redblooded American should keep it in mind.\nThank you.\n\n8\n\n\f"

        "content": "Economic Challenges\nRemarks before the Greater Houston Partnership\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nHouston, Texas\nSeptember 4, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fEconomic Challenges\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Doug [Foshee, CEO of El Paso Corp.]. I am most grateful for this opportunity to\naddress the Greater Houston Partnership. This great metropolis houses a key branch of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, overseen most ably by Admiral Bob Smith from that splendid\nMichael Graves-designed building on Allen Parkway. I want to tell you that that building was\ndelivered on time and on budget thanks to Leo Linbeck’s good work and Bob’s watchful eye. Of\ncourse, we would expect no less from a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nI salute you, Leo. The great entrepreneur Norman Brinker told me when I first came to Texas in\n1973 that “it is nice to be important. But it is more important to be nice.” Leo is the embodiment\nof being both nice and important. And so is Bob. Thank you both for your exemplary leadership.\n\nThis is an exciting period in American history. We have two able presidential candidates vying\nfor the highest office in the land during a period of enormous economic challenges. The central\nbank of the United States—the Federal Reserve—is chartered by Congress to conduct monetary\npolicy so as to engender maximum sustainable noninflationary growth. To do so, the Federal\nReserve and its officials and staff must remain scrupulously nonpartisan and nonpolitical. When\nyou enter the temple of the Fed, you check your political affiliation and interests at the door. We\nfavor no party and no candidate. We treasure our independence.\nI say this up front so as to politely ask you to pardon me if I dodge any questions you might be\ntempted to ask about the presidential campaign at the conclusion of these comments.\nThat said, I thought I would sketch out for you the circumstances the new president and the new\nCongress will be confronted with when they are elected.\nTwo weeks ago, I spoke in Aspen and described the current domestic economic predicament like\nthis: The housing market has yet to find its bottom; credit markets remain tempestuous; creditors\nare tightening their standards; consumers and businesses are battening down the hatches and\nreefing in their sails. The prices of Chinese and other emerging country labor and inputs we have\ncome to depend on have been rising; business margins are being squeezed; consumers are\nsuffering from declining real incomes; savers and investors are confronted with negative real\nrates of return. These are hardly fortuitous circumstances.\nIn Admiral Smith’s parlance, having sailed the economy along for years in a tranquil following\nsea, we are now navigating Force 10 conditions. To be sure, on the growth front we have\nmanaged to make better headway than most everyone expected under the circumstances: To\neveryone’s surprise, our $14 trillion economy grew at a 3.3 percent annualized rate last quarter,\nmeaning that the American economy produced almost $29 billion more in the second quarter\nthan it did in the first.\n\nThat said, looking off the bow, I see nothing on the horizon that would lead me to conclude\nanything different than what I articulated in Aspen: The data received since then on personal\n1\n\n\fconsumption expenditures, real capital expenditures and construction show the third quarter off\nto a weak start, although yesterday’s manufacturing numbers were a nice surprise on the upside.\nI think it is very likely we will suffer anemic growth for the current and perhaps the next couple\nof quarters. But I want to lay down a caveat: What bothers me is that this is a widely held view. I\nlearned over the years as a market operator that the consensus view is almost always wrong.\nAmerican entrepreneurs and business leaders are ingenious in figuring out how to overcome\nobstacles that might befall lesser capitalists. Still, I think it likely that our movement through the\nmuck and the flotsam and jetsam of the credit and housing debacle will be sluggish, and it may\ntake some time into 2009 for us to get the economy back up to a snappier cruising speed.\nAs to the inflation outlook, there appear to me to be even odds that one of two scenarios will\nobtain.\nThe first calls for slowing domestic and economic growth to dampen the inflationary surges we\nhave seen of late. This scenario banks heavily on the recent price reversals in energy and other\ncommodity prices and takes succor in the fact that, but for the oil patch and construction sectors\nin Texas and elsewhere on the Gulf Coast, domestic wage pressures have been tame, mitigating\nthe odds of what inflation watchers most fear: a self-reinforcing wage–price spiral in response to\nupward pressures in the cost of living.\nThe other probable scenario assumes that rather than passing through as a “one-off’ event, there\nis some spreading of the inflationary pressures we have been experiencing. According to this\nscenario, the inflationary scare we experienced of late infiltrates the mindset of consumers and\nbusiness operators alike, and they begin to change their behavioral patterns accordingly.\nIn my most recent series of speeches, I have enumerated several examples of the actions taken by\na wide swath of businesses to recover their costs by raising prices. In the interest of time, I will\nnot repeat them here. All you need to do is look at Tuesday’s New York Times article titled\n“Despite Lower Oil Prices, Little Relief for Consumers” to get the picture. 1 After companies\nhave had their margins gutted by dramatic rises in their cost of goods sold, one can envision\nthem being a little skeptical about the durability of recent price retrenchments in the commodities\nmarkets and taking advantage of every opportunity to buy protection from being victimized\nagain. Under this scenario, consumer prices prove sticky on the downside.\nThe jury is still very much out as to which scenario will obtain. The most recent inflation reports\nare not particularly encouraging. On Aug. 29, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE)\nnumbers for July were released. The “headline” inflation rate for the PCE came in at an\nannualized pace of 7.9 percent. This is better than the 9.3 percent we saw for June. And yet if\nyou link May, June and July together, but for the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, you\nhave to go back to 1982 to find a worse three-month stretch for consumer price inflation.\nMoreover, if you break out the component details of the PCE, you would notice that of the\nexpenditure-weighted items—there are over 200 items in the basket whose price movements are\ntracked—85 percent increased in price, with 48 percent rising faster than a 5 percent annualized\nrate, up from 33 percent in the June period.\n1\n\n“Despite Lower Oil Prices, Little Relief for Consumers,” by Louis Uchitelle and Michael M. Grynbaum, New York\nTimes, Sept. 2, 2008.\n2\n\n\fAs every economist worth his or her salt will tell you, you have to be careful to sort out the\n“noise” from the “signal” in all these data to discern the underlying trend. Taking all our various\nprice measures together (both PCE-based and CPI-based), here is what you can say: It is pretty\nclear that trend consumer price inflation has accelerated over the past few months.\nLess clear, however, is the duration of this acceleration. The thing you have to constantly bear in\nmind is that data represent the past. It is history, not the future. To discern the future course of\neconomic phenomena you have to keep your ear to the ground, in addition to consulting\neconometric models.\nI repeat that while it seems pretty clear that economic momentum is slowing, the jury is out on\nwhether lesser momentum will be sufficient to translate into relief on the price front over the\nintermediate to longer term. In East Texas parlance, “It might could, but it mightn’t”; it most\ndefinitely has not thus far.\nIn formulating my input into the upcoming discussions of the Federal Open Mark Committee\n(FOMC), I am going to be listening very closely to my contacts in the business community as to\ntheir perception of the direction of prices while carefully studying the entrails of the models and\nother econometric tools employed by our able economists at the Dallas Fed and the Board of\nGovernors.\nI will say this much and then shift to more felicitous subjects: Within the aviary that is the\nFOMC, I am viewed by outside analysts and by the press as being the “most hawkish” on\ninflation, sometimes referred to in [Larry] McMurtry-esque language as “The Lonesome Hawk.”\nNeither I nor what commentators describe as my “less hawkish” or “dovish” colleagues feel that\nthis convenient nomenclature does justice to our approach to policy. The one thing we do not\nwish to become are pigeons. So we work double time, overtime to try to deliver on our mandate\nto provide the monetary conditions for maximum sustainable noninflationary employment\ngrowth. And doing so means we must be wary of risks on both the growth and inflation fronts.\nSo much for fowl language. I want to turn now to some good news that also comes from a close\nanalysis of the recent numbers—a ray of sunshine, if you will, peeping through the dark clouds. I\nrefer to our growing prominence as a global service provider.\nAmericans are champion exporters. In 2007, we sold $1.1 trillion in goods to satisfy foreign\nconsumers, ranging from one of our biggest exports, semiconductors, to soybeans to airplanes to\npharmaceuticals. The shipment of goods is vital to the future of Texas, as we are the largest\nexporting state, having recently pulled ahead of California, in no insignificant part due to the\ngreat Port of Houston. But a close study of the numbers makes clear that as we move forward in\ntime, our nation’s comparative advantage in global markets increasingly lies in the service\nsector.\nIn 2007, Americans sold nearly $500 billion in services to foreign customers, more than the\ncombined total of the two next largest service exporters, Germany and Great Britain. The most\nrecent data show service exports are running about 17 percent ahead of last year’s pace and have\nbeen growing at a rate of 12 percent per annum for the past five years.\n3\n\n\fHoustonians and Americans are top-notch competitors in most all high-value-added service\nsectors. In industrial engineering, U.S. exports exceed imports by nearly 24 to 1. Our ratio in the\ndistribution of film and television programs is 13 to 1. In both medical care and in construction\nservices, areas where Texas hits the ball out of the park, the edge is 10 to 1. We have an 8 to 1\nedge in information processing. I could lull you to sleep with a recitation of each and every\nservice sector, so let me just say that in over three-quarters of all trade categories classified by\nthe Department of Commerce, the United States maintains significant comparative advantage\nrelative to the rest of the world. We run a trade surplus in services.\nThe consensus view among leading economists is that growth of the global economy is slowing\npresently. Yet, even if the global economy slows in the immediate future, over time we will\ncontinue to benefit from our comparative advantage in providing services. Let’s look at the two\ncountries that everyone seems to be focusing on: China and India.\nOur chief economist at the Dallas Fed, Michael Cox, calculates that China will add $116 billion\nto global demand for medical care in 2008. India will contribute an additional $25 billion in\ndemand. Together, these two countries’ increase in demand for medical care in just one year will\nbe more than four times that of the United States.\nOr look at recreational services. In the U.S., we add roughly $23 billion a year in spending on\nrecreation. In China, one year’s added demand comes to $79 billion, and in India, $16 billion.\nWe have enormous capacity to sell into those and other more-developed markets American\nservices that are head and shoulders above the competition. Why? Because we have the right\nstuff. Over a third of our workers have earned at least a college degree, tops in the world. A good\nmany of them hold services jobs and are among the world’s most productive service workers.\nHerein lies a challenge that goes above and beyond monetary policy. If we want to keep growing\nthe United States’ share of the global market for services, we must resist the siren call of\nprotectionism. We cannot expect to have our service-sector team rack up points on the trade\nscoreboard if we pull out of the game and retreat into a defensive crouch in the other sectors of\nour economy. I hope both presidential candidates and both political parties will bear this in mind.\nWe must always remember that the ultimate source of our comparative advantage in providing\nhigh-value-added services and brain-intensive goods like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals to\nthe rest of the world is the three-pound machine that sits on top of every American’s shoulders—\nthe American brain.\nWe cannot succeed in a globalized world without superior educational institutions. You all have\nheard the arguments a million times and I won’t repeat them here, except to ask you to consider\ntwo aspects of the clear need to plow an enormous amount of money and effort into continually\nmaking for the best-educated workforce in the world.\nFirst, if Texas is to become the brightest star in the American economic sky, we simply must\ndrive our universities to higher levels of excellence. As Houstonians, you should be proud of the\nfact that Rice was ranked by last year’s U.S. News and World Report survey as 17th in the nation\nfor overall excellence, above Vanderbilt and University of California–Berkeley. As Texans, you\nshould be less proud that, according to that survey, six campuses in the University of California\n4\n\n\fsystem outranked the University of Texas at Austin, which U.S. News ranks at 47th. Or that\nTexas A&M ranked 64th, SMU 66th and Baylor 76th. 2\nThere are numerous other measures of “brain prowess,” and on almost all fronts the point is\nclear: While we can be justifiably proud of Rice, we should be making every effort to bring our\nother academies up to the highest standards in order to secure our future. By almost any measure,\nwe are falling short on this front, be it the number of faculty members Texas universities have in\nthe National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Engineering or the Institute of\nMedicine or as winners of Nobel prizes or—that great arbiter of academic excellence—as\nclaimants to federal R&D dollars.\nDavid Daniel, the president of UT Dallas, likes to point to an exemplary study done by\neconomists with BankBoston in 1994 about MIT alumni. 3 That study showed that more than\n4,000 high-value-added companies employing 1.1 million people were founded by MIT grads. In\n1994 those companies grossed $232 billion. By contrast, in 2005, Dallas–Fort Worth, a region\nresponsible for one-third of our state’s economic output, reported a gross metropolitan output of\n$285 billion. The Austin–Round Rock MSA reported a gross metropolitan product of $66.2\nbillion that same year. In 1994, MIT alums produced approximately as much as the entire DFW\nmetroplex 10 years later and three and a half times as much as our state capital.\nTexas is a mighty economic machine. We cannot expect to stay mighty in a knowledge-driven,\nservice-sector-powered world unless we see to it that our major universities achieve the\nstandards of a Rice University or an MIT.\nThe second point is that we cannot expect to do so unless we develop a sensible approach to\nimmigration. Most of the time, the discussion of immigration focuses on the poor and huddled\nmasses that wish to come to our economic shores, like my parents did 70 years ago, as did the\nancestors of most every person in this room. But there is another side to the immigration issue\nthat is very much as important.\nConsider two illustrative facts: Fifty-five percent of the engineering master’s degrees awarded by\nmajor Texas universities went to foreign citizens. Seventy-five percent of engineering Ph.D.’s\nfrom those same universities also went to foreigners.\nNow consider this: These same skilled immigrants must wait up to 10 years for a green card\nwhen they are lucky enough to get an H-1B visa first. While the U.S. is busy turning away the\nbest and the brightest, other governments are thinking proactively about how to take more of\nthem in. The Australian government recently announced they will seek to increase their pool of\nskilled foreign workers by 30 percent. The European Union is considering a skilled immigration\nprogram similar to our H-1B visa; some of the original EU nations are already benefiting from\ninfluxes of skilled migrants from the new member nations in Eastern Europe.\n\n2\n\n“America’s Best Colleges 2009,” U.S. News and World Report,\nhttp://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/national-search.\n3\n“Thoughts on Creating More Tier One Universities in Texas,” by David E. Daniel,\nhttp://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/commit/c535/20080723/David_Daniel_Tier_One_Universities_Report.pdf.\n5\n\n\fSo where do you think these wonderful students that we have educated in universities subsidized\nby taxpayer money and private endowments are going to go?\nThis is nonsense. It is as though we went out and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to drill\nexploratory wells and then when they were proven, simply gave all the oil or gas away to others.\nWe need an immigration policy that encourages the cream of the crop of foreigners to stay here\nand help us build our economy and stay ahead of the competition in the high-value-added service\nsector.\nOne of my more erudite friends puts it this way: Pretend the U.S. is an NFL franchise. Everyone\nwants to play on our team; we could have every first- and second-round draft choice we wanted\nif the rules allowed it. And yet we give them away to other teams.\nI hope you good Houstonians will do all you can to influence the lawmakers of our land to\nredress our nonsensical immigration policy.\nEnough serious stuff. I want to come back to Leo and Bob. Remember I told you that they\nbrought our branch building here in on time and on budget? Well, my wife, Nancy, and I are\ndoing a major remodeling of our house. On Sept. 8, Nancy and I will celebrate our 35th wedding\nanniversary. I can honestly tell you that in those 35 years—three and a half decades—we have\nnever—not once—had an argument … that I haven’t lost. This record remains intact with the\nrebuilding of our house. So, Leo and Bob, you could win one for the Gipper just this once if you\nwould share your secrets with me. I promise to keep them to myself.\nThank you all. I would be happy to avoid answering your questions now.\n\n6\n\n\f"

        "content": "Monetary Policy in Uncertain Times\n(With a Salute to Julius Squeezer\nand Mr. Bean)\nRemarks before the Progress & Freedom Foundation\nAspen Summit 2008\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nAspen, Colorado\nAugust 19, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fMonetary Policy in Uncertain Times\n(With a Salute to Julius Squeezer and Mr. Bean)\nRichard W. Fisher\nI am grateful for the invitation to speak to such an impressive gathering of technologically savvy\npeople. I want you to know what a tremendous sacrifice it is to be here in the Rockies, instead of\nsitting at home like a hard-boiled egg in the steamy summertime cauldron of Texas. Mark Twain\nfamously said that everybody talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it. Well, I\nhave done something about it: I’ve come to Aspen. Bret [Swanson], thank you for inviting me.\nAnd thank you for that kind introduction.\nLast night I had the pleasure of talking about China at dinner with a group of you. Today, I\nwould like to talk about the issues we face at the Fed as we work to create the monetary\nconditions for achieving sustainable, noninflationary employment growth in very uncertain\ntimes. But first, given the interests of this group, I want to tip my hat to information technology\nand quickly tell you about the IT side of the Federal Reserve.\nMost of what you read about the Federal Reserve focuses on monetary policy, which I will turn\nto shortly. Yet, in addition to setting the base interbank lending rate, known as the fed funds rate,\nthe Fed operates a pretty complex business.\nWe meet the banking system’s need for cash. The 12 regional banks store currency and coins in\nmassive vaults and use 132 machines to count and sort currency at a rate of 86,000 bills an hour,\nday in, day out. We clear checks. Last year, we processed 5.8 billion paper checks and 4.1 billion\nelectronically imaged checks. We moved $5 trillion per day between financial institutions to\nsettle their accounts.\nAnd we extend credit. Over the past eight months, we have lent considerable amounts through\nthe discount window and other facilities created to provide liquidity and alleviate strains in the\nfinancial system. At its peak, credit outstanding approached $180 billion and currently stands at\nabout $165 billion. This is on top of our currency swap agreements designed to provide more\nthan $60 billion of liquidity to European banks. In addition, we have made available large\namounts of Treasury securities to primary dealers.\nNone of this would be possible, of course, without sophisticated information technology and\nsystems. As Bret mentioned, in addition to serving as president of the Dallas Fed, I chair the IT\nOversight Committee for the Conference of Presidents of the 12 regional banks.\nLet me give some idea of the dimensions of our Systemwide IT needs. Our mainframe\nprocessing power totals nearly 9,000 millions of instructions per second, or MIPS. We have in\nexcess of one petabyte, or one quadrillion bytes, of data storage capacity. Across the System, we\nhave about 4,500 servers and 24,000 desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. Our\nnational networks support nearly 3,000 high-bandwidth circuits that reach about 1,500 end\npoints, both internal locations and external customers. To keep this technology functioning, we\nemploy 3,600 IT professionals. Our annual spend on IT is roughly $1 billion.\n1\n\n\fTo say that it is a special pleasure to spend a couple of days surrounded by IT professionals—\nwho aren’t trying to sell something—would be an understatement. I look forward to learning a\nlot more from you these next few days than you will likely learn from me today.\nLet me turn to the current predicament facing monetary policy makers. Keep in mind that what I\nam about to say reflects my own opinions and experiences. I do not speak for the Federal\nReserve or the other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), our main\npolicymaking group.\nWe are in the midst of a fierce correction from a prolonged period of indiscriminate behavior in\nthe credit markets, a surfeit of home building, a global avalanche of cheap labor and\ncorrespondingly cheap imports, and other unsustainable financial and economic activity. If you\nwere a yachtsman, you would say that we sailed the economy along in a following sea for a long\ntime; now we are navigating force 10 seas. Everyone is battening down the hatches and reefing\nin their sails. Worldwide, creditors are tightening their standards and consumers and businesses\nare correcting their courses.\nThe correction in the housing market has yet to find its bottom. Credit markets remain\ntempestuous. The price of the Chinese and other emerging-country labor we came to rely upon to\nhold costs down is rising; the cost of imported goods, and of goods and services overall, is rising\ntoo, driven in part by demand from the newly rich consumers in those emerging countries. U.S.\nconsumers are being hammered by declining real income, U.S. savers and investors are being\nsqueezed by negative real interest rates and U.S. companies’ business margins are under\npressure.\nAll these forces have conspired to constrain economic growth. My best guess is that our $14\ntrillion economy grew faster than the 1.9 percent annualized rate initially reported for the second\nquarter, thanks to exports and prudent inventory management. But I expect U.S. economic\ngrowth will decelerate to a snail’s pace, if not completely grind to a halt, in the second half of\nthis year. Indeed, we may see the slowdown extend into 2009 as the excesses that drove the\nhousing markets unwind before the economy can again gear up to cruising speed. Then, as 2009\nunfolds, it is quite possible that the economy will resume a more normal growth trajectory.\nCongress charged the Federal Reserve with creating the monetary conditions for sustainable,\nnoninflationary employment growth. We are sorely aware of the present risk to job growth. At\nthe same time, we have to be keenly aware of the consequences of our actions for inflation. We\nhave a dual mandate—the operative words modifying growth are “sustainable” and\n“noninflationary”—and we are duty bound to deliver upon it.\nA clear-eyed observer would, I believe, look at the facts and say the Fed has done its job on the\ngrowth front. The FOMC has taken aggressive action to stabilize the credit markets and has not\nbeen shy about cutting the fed funds rate. It would likely appear to that clear-eyed observer that\nthese initiatives have paid dividends: The U.S. economy has continued to grow. In fact, but for\nthe fourth quarter of 2007, the numbers have thus far been better than what most pundits\nexpected, though everyone and his sister, including me, contemplates a more anemic outlook\ngoing forward. (The old hedge fund manager in me tells me that when everyone and his sister\n2\n\n\fshares a view—when there is consensus on the street—it is usually wrong, but I still think the\ngrowth outlook for the next quarters is unpleasant.)\nAs for the “noninflationary” part, the observer would take heart from the recent price reversals\nthat have taken place in the oil and commodity markets. But her brow might knit up a bit as she\ndissects the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released Thursday. That report said that consumer\ninflation increased at an annualized rate of 10.3 percent in July and that, year over year,\nconsumer prices have risen 5.5 percent. She might also note that roughly 25 percent of our\nConsumer Price Index is a theoretical construct to capture the cost of shelter called “owner’s\nequivalent rent” and conclude that the effective cost pressure on consumers and business\noperators is actually higher than the headline number.\nAnd our clear-eyed woman would note that even as economists remove energy and food from\nthe CPI to eliminate the “noise” of those volatile items, the underlying, or “core,” inflation\nmeasure is also drifting upward on a year-over-year basis, indicating that inflationary pressures\nare spreading beyond energy and food prices. Were she an economics wonk, she might further\nnote that the “trimmed mean” CPI that the Cleveland Fed calculates—another way to parse the\ndata to look for the underlying trend—posted a one-month gain of 7.2 percent, something it has\nonly done once before, in 1991.\nIt is important to remember, however, that the July CPI is history. Data are the past. The question\nthat the FOMC must wrestle with is: What will occur on the inflation front going forward?\nIn an op-ed in the August 7 issue of the Financial Times—perhaps the world’s most renowned\nnewspaper before the recent surge of the National Enquirer—one of the world’s most respected\neconomists, Martin Feldstein, wrote that the Federal Reserve “is prepared to gamble that the\nweakness in U.S. employment and the general decline in economic activity will prevent a wageprice spiral without further increases in the interest rate. If food and energy prices remain at\ntoday’s level and wage costs do not accelerate, the overall consumer price index inflation will\ndecline by next year….” 1\nWere I rewriting that paragraph, I would purge the word “gamble” because the thought of any\nsemblance of gambling at the Fed is contrary to my experience. The FOMC—the 16 dedicated\nindividuals whom I have the great privilege of working with under the leadership of Ben\nBernanke—does not gamble. To be sure, we are aware any economic outcome is subject to\nprobabilities and chance. But the verb “gamble” carries the connotation of squandering away\nhard-earned capital. The earnest men and women who make up the FOMC have no intention of\nsquandering the bedrock capital of a central bank: the confidence the public places in our hands\nto keep inflation at bay while we work to bolster economic growth and restore the financial\nsystem.\nThat said, you do not have to be a gambler to subscribe to Dr. Feldstein’s scenario. The markets\nin commodities, like those of stocks and bonds, are manic-depressive mechanisms and overshoot\non the upside as well as on the downside. One could reasonably deduce from recent price\nreversals in oil and food prices that they overshot on the upside and that their price run-up was a\n1\n\n“The Crisis: A Tale of Two Monetary Policies,” by Martin Feldstein, Financial Times, Aug. 7,\n2008.\n3\n\n\fone-off development. If you subscribe to this argument, you envision a process not unlike that of\na python digesting dinner: It visibly moves through the system, creating some moments of\ndiscomfort—in this case, a temporary inflationary bulge—but is processed in reasonable time\nand done with.\nBecause this is a serious speech, I will refrain from telling you about my neighbor in Dallas who\nhad a pet python named Julius Squeezer. But I will tell you that I learned much from watching\nthat python over the years: He was an efficient processor of most anything he swallowed,\nalthough there were times when he had to be taken to the vet to be treated for indigestion.\nIt is tempting to deduce from the recent reversal of commodity prices—in particular, energy\nprices save coal—that the discomfort manifest in headline inflation numbers that we broached in\nJuly is passing through the system and is being squeezed out by slowing economic growth. This\nis certainly a plausible economic scenario. Weakness in the U.S. and other advanced economies\nwill mitigate inflationary pressures, rendering them a temporary inconvenience. In the parlance\nof central bankers, the recent run-up of headline and core prices represents “noise” rather than\nunderlying “signal.” Given that the Fed focuses on signals about intermediate and long-term\nsustainable, noninflationary employment growth, rather than short-term expediency, it is in\nkeeping with our charter to give considerable weight to this scenario.\nI note that we would not be alone in doing so. This is the conclusion that the Bank of England\nhas been most public about as it recently ceased raising its policy rate. I have the highest\npersonal regard for Governor Mervyn King and especially for his deputy, a member of the\ndistinguished advisory board of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, the\nconvivially named Mr. Charlie Bean. I did note, however, that in reaction to the recent release of\nthe Bank of England’s analysis, the Financial Times on Thursday wrote an especially harsh\neditorial titled “Shoot the Doves,” which concluded with these words:\n\n“The ongoing disruption in credit markets is acting as a brake on the economy … because credit\nis less available and it costs more .… Keeping rates on hold looks right for now.”\n“But,” the editorial went on, “… the Bank must also worry about its credibility: if the public\nceases to believe that it will bring inflation back down, then it will become much harder to do\nso.” 2\n\nThis risk applies to the Fed just as much as it does to the Bank of England. We cannot afford to\ngamble away our credibility. That is why the FOMC has made it clear in its recent statements\nthat we are keenly monitoring inflationary impulses. In doing so, we must be wary of a second\npossible scenario, one that differs from the one summarized by Dr. Feldstein.\nThis second scenario is less felicitous. It acknowledges the manic-depressive nature of\ncommodity markets and recognizes that it was inevitable that price peaks would give way to\n2\n\nEditorial comment, “Shoot the Doves,” Financial Times, Aug. 13, 2008.\n\n4\n\n\fprice valleys. But the scenario envisions the possibility that rather than passing through the\npython, the recent burst of cost-push inflation is giving the beast digestion problems that might\nmanifest themselves in the form of a lingering inflationary fever.\nMany micros make a macro. The economy is the sum of its parts. Jobs are created by, and prices\nare set by, microeconomic units, by businesses—thousands upon thousands upon thousands of\nthem.\nBusiness operators do what they are paid to do—grow their bottom lines in good times and\nprotect them in bad. Presently, it is difficult to grow top lines in the U.S. domestic market\nbecause demand is anemic. And yet it is increasingly difficult to protect bottom lines because\ncritical components of the cost of goods sold have been rising. What comes in through the back\ndoor of most businesses has been rising, driven by fuel and transportation and other input costs.\nLabor costs at home have been restrained. But labor costs in other places where American\ncompanies produce and source goods, particularly China, have been rising dramatically.\nHere is where the globalization process hits the inflationary road. Not long ago, the newfound\ndesire of the Chinese and Indians and former Soviet satellites and the Brazilians and others to\nhop onboard the capitalist ship led to a flood of cheap labor and low-cost goods and outsourced\nservices. Our economy experienced the most pleasant of tailwinds, propelling it forward while\nrestraining inflation. Now that these countries are climbing up the income ladder and consuming\nmore of what we consume, we are facing a bracing headwind from the very same sources that\npreviously helped our economy sail along.\nThe Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security reports that in the first half of\nthis year, wages in urban areas, where most U.S. and foreign firms make or assemble products,\nrose 18 percent. And, as any U.S. firm operating in China will tell you, recent stepped-up\nenforcement of job rules has made China an even more expensive place to operate.\nI cannot tell you how much we should weigh this particular cost component. Nobody knows the\nanswer to how this impacts cost structures here at home. But this much is clear: The tailwind that\nwas holding labor costs at home hostage to the threat of outsourcing production to China has\nbeen significantly mitigated. Any garment producer or hospital equipment maker or high tech\nassembler operating in China can testify to that.\nIn addition, as income levels have risen in the emerging countries, so has their appetite for raw\nmaterials and basic necessities. China, for example, now has 37 million cars; the press reports\nthat they will reach 50 million cars in 2009, on their way to some 100 million in fairly short\norder. Fueling that fleet contributes to the country’s rising demand for oil, now largely satisfied\nby imports of 8 million barrels of oil a day. As China grows, she will require still more oil. How\nmuch? Well, here is a simple calculation you can do. A week ago, the Wall Street Journal 3\npointed out that the Japanese consume 14 barrels of oil per capita each year, whereas the\nEuropeans consume 17 and the Americans 25. If China used the same amount of oil per capita as\nparsimonious Japan, China’s consumption would total more than 18 billion barrels a year, an\namount that dwarfs our consumption of 7.5 billion barrels. Add that to new demand stemming\n3\n\n“U.S. Retools Economy, Curbing Thirst for Oil,” by Justin Lahart and Conor Dougherty, Wall\nStreet Journal, Aug. 12, 2008, p. A1.\n5\n\n\ffor oil from the billion people of India, the new members of the European community, an\nincreasingly prosperous Brazil and so on, and extrapolate these new demand pressures for oil to\nwood or steel or food oils or animal proteins or anything else that growing economies consume,\nand you begin to get the picture of what keeps a forward-thinking businesswoman or man up at\nnight.\nIf you layer a Chinese wage-price spiral and demand-pull forces on top of the shiver sent up the\nspine by sudden price increases in most raw materials this past year, you might forgive U.S.\nbusiness operators—the women and men who do the spadework to create the employment we\nseek to encourage through prudent monetary policy—for doing what rational managers do to\nprotect their margins. At bedtime, they may pray on their knees, thanking the market gods for the\nrecent correction in prices for oil and gas and other materials. But during the day they are doing\ntwo things: (1) They are cutting whatever costs they have control over by reducing head count,\nstretching out inventories, pulling back on capital expenditures, and so on; and (2) they are\nseeking to pass through costs that are out of their direct control—the ones that are coming\nthrough the back door—by raising prices of the goods and services they ship out the front door.\nOn August 1, for example, the Wall Street Journal 4 reported that Unilever offset cost pressures\nby raising the average price of its thousands of products by 7.4 percent, despite having seen its\nvolume of goods sold slip by 0.5 percent in the second quarter. The article added that Unilever’s\nCEO “didn’t plan to make any major changes.”\nNeither, according to public reports, do companies as varied as Dow Chemical, Frito-Lay,\nKodak, McDonald’s, American Airlines and the various 99 cent stores. Even Bloomberg, the\ngreat electronic purveyor of financial information and news, is protecting margins by raising\nprices: Last week, they notified their customers, including the Dallas Fed, they would be\nincreasing prices by 6 percent on December 1. It was noteworthy that in releasing his company’s\nearnings for the second quarter, the CFO of Wal-Mart said suppliers were asking for price\nincreases at a “higher level than I can remember since I began at the company.” 5\nThis behavioral response, were it to become even more widespread, leads to unpleasant\nconsequences for me and my fellow policymakers. Unless the python that is the U.S. economy\ncan quickly pass the recent burst of cost-push pressures, we risk a reinforcing spreading of\ninflationary impulses and expectations. Should this happen and the Fed were to fail to address it,\nwe would run the risk of losing the public’s confidence in our ability to constrain inflation. Then\nthe great editorial writers in this country, to say nothing of Congress and the American people,\nwill be calling for all of us—doves and hawks alike—to be shot (metaphorically speaking, of\ncourse).\n\n4\n\n“Unilever’s Earnings Fall as Price Increases Hurt Sales,” by Aaron O.

        "content": "A Perspective on China\nRemarks to a Working Dinner Sponsored by the\nProgress & Freedom Foundation\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nAspen, Colorado\nAugust 18, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fA Perspective on China\nRichard W. Fisher\nI may have the longest record of experience with China of anybody in this room, including\nChinese nationals. My Australian father and South African-born Norwegian mother sailed out of\nShanghai on the S.S. President Wilson just as that port was being closed by Communist\nrevolutionaries in 1948. In a story too long to tell, my parents had been dispatched to collect a\ndollar payment owed an American company—the Spazier Chemical and Soap Company. They\nleft Shanghai with more than Spazier’s loot: My mother was with child—me. I was born the\nfollowing March, the felicitous by-product of an otherwise fretful stay at the Peace Hotel on the\nBund.\nI have been asked to speak to you tomorrow about “Monetary Policy in a Globalized World.”\nTonight, I establish my bona fides for that talk: I was manufactured by an Australian–South\nAfrican/Norwegian partnership in China, shipped across the Pacific and on to Mexico for final\nassembly, and then sent across the border to the U.S. to become one of the innumerable factors\nthat make for a dynamic economy that is uniquely American. You can’t be more globalized than\nthat!\nMy embryonic experience allows me to lay claim to being a China watcher for nearly 60 years.\nBut it was only in 1979, when I served in the Carter administration as coordinator of policy\nplanning and assistant to Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, that I first saw China. I\nmention this for a reason. My early experience in China, coupled with my involvement 20 years\nlater in negotiating China’s accession to the World Trade Organization for President Clinton,\nforms the lens through which I now view China.\nI am going to focus my brief remarks tonight on some of the perspectives gained from that first\ntrip to China.\nPresident Nixon and Henry Kissinger had famously normalized political relations with China in\ntheir meetings with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai in 1972. It fell on President Carter to settle the\ncounterclaims between the U.S. and China that stemmed from the Communist takeover in 1949.\nMao’s forces failed to seize the cash of Spazier Chemical and Soap, but managed to seize the\nrailroad stock and other assets the U.S. had lent or invested in Nationalist China; we, in turn,\nretaliated by freezing China’s accounts in U.S. banks. Without settling those counterclaims, we\ncould not normally trade with each other. So after months of rigorous preparation, Secretary\nBlumenthal and his team, including me as his faithful chef de cabinet, were dispatched from\nAndrews Air Force Base to Beijing on Feb. 23, 1979, to settle the claims. We met with Deng\nXiaoping, then-Chairman Hua Guofeng—a hapless fellow traveler of Mao’s whom we met with\nonly for the purposes of being photographed for the People’s Daily but paid little attention to,\ngiven that we knew of Deng’s ascendancy—and Blumenthal’s official counterpart, Finance\nMinister Zhang Jin-fu. We sealed the preliminary deal on March 1, after arduous negotiations\nwith Deng and Zhang, and that day officially raised the flag over the American Embassy in\nBeijing, establishing the fulsome presence of the U.S. in China.\n\n1\n\n\fThe memories of this trip flooded back as I viewed the opening ceremonies of the spectacle and\npageantry of the Olympics in Beijing.\nWhen we landed in that city on Saturday night, Feb. 24, 1979, we were whisked off to the\nofficial guesthouse in Red Flag limousines. The roads into Beijing had no cars—not because the\nroute had been cordoned off for our delegation but because there simply weren’t any. What\ntraffic we did see included skinny horses, donkeys, camels, oxen, exhaust-spewing trucks and\ncountless bicycles made in the Forever bicycle factory in Shanghai for the purpose of realizing\nZhou’s “four modernizations.”\nBy 2006, just 27 years later, Beijing had some 2.4 million motor vehicles, a small fraction of\nChina’s total of 37 million.\nThink about that. Worldwide, roughly half of oil production goes into making gasoline and diesel\nfuel. In 2008, China is projected to consume nearly 8 million barrels of oil daily. Let’s say that,\nconservatively, 2.5 million barrels of that goes into propelling the present auto and truck fleet of\nthe country. You can do the numbers and see the amount of oil that will be required just to feed\nthe fleet of Chinese autos as it grows to 100 million.\nWhen the Blumenthal delegation arrived in Beijing in 1979, the main customers for OPEC and\nother oil producers were the U.S., Japan and Western Europe. You may remember that in today’s\ndollars the price of oil was broaching $90 at that time, on its way the next year to $100 plus.\nNow, oil producers have as customers an added 1.3 billion Chinese, who not only drive cars but\noperate factories and require heat for their homes, as well as the populations of catch-up players\nlike India and the countries liberated from Soviet tyranny. This puts the supply and demand for\noil and diesel and gasoline into perspective. A week ago, the Wall Street Journal pointed out that\nJapan consumes 14 barrels of oil a year per capita, Europe consumes 17 and America consumes\n25. If China used the same amount per capita as parsimonious Japan, Chinese consumption\nwould total more than 18 billion barrels a year, an amount that dwarfs our country’s 7.5 billion\nbarrels. Add that to new demand for oil stemming from India, the newest members of the\nEuropean community, an increasingly prosperous Brazil and so on. For those trying to discern\nthe long-term future of oil prices, this is considerable food for thought.\nOnce we reached the initial agreement to settle our claims on China—at roughly 40 cents on the\ndollar—we flew to Shanghai on a Chinese military plane for a little R&R before returning to\nBeijing to tidy up some fine points. The Chinese government had picked out the prettiest military\nwomen they could muster to serve us drinks and meals on the flight—nothing becomes a pretty\nwoman like the uniform of the People’s Liberation Army. On a whim, my counterpart and seat\nmate from the State Department, Bob Hormats, who is now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs,\ntook out a Polaroid camera and took a picture of these impromptu flight attendants. You would\nhave thought he had struck a match in some far corner of the world where fire had never been\nseen. The flight attendants squealed with delight, and the entire crew, including the pilots, came\nto the back of the plane to examine this previously unseen, newfangled technology. Imagine that.\nThis was roughly a quarter century after Polaroid had become commonplace in the U.S. and four\nyears after the two Steves—Jobs and Wozniak—brought forth the first commercial Apple\ncomputer. The Chinese public had never seen a Polaroid camera, let alone heard of a computer.\n\n2\n\n\fPolaroid has since gone kaput. China now owns what used to be IBM’s PC business. Today,\nChina produces 93.4 million microcomputers, and it has 600 million domestic cell phone\nsubscribers. The country has become the world’s largest exporter of information technology\ngoods. The Chinese conduct technological espionage so brilliantly that business and government\nleaders in Europe and the U.S. are told that any conversation held anywhere in the world within\nrange of a BlackBerry can be listened to by Chinese agents even if you have it turned off, so long\nas the SIM card and battery are in place.\nWe no longer regard China as a technological backwater. Think back to that opening Olympic\nceremony two Friday nights ago. In 1979, a Polaroid camera stunned the most advanced Chinese\nmilitary pilots. In 2008, the show put on in the Olympic “Bird’s Nest” exhibited an ability to\nharness technology that rivals the most sophisticated weapons or game designer or software\nprogrammer in Silicon Valley.\nWhich brings me to this ancient land’s willingness to adopt and adapt. When Deng Xiaoping\nentered the room for the initial encounter with Blumenthal, he cackled, “Where are these big\nAmerican capitalists we Chinese are supposed to be so afraid of?” During our meeting, he made\na remark that paralleled his famous “black cat, white cat” theme—“it doesn’t matter if the cat is\nwhite or black as long as it catches mice.” Deng’s remarks encapsulated the importance of\npractical results over political correctness and economic development over ideological purity—\nboth hallmarks of modern China. Deng made it clear to our delegation that China was intent on\nmodernization, that the Chinese cat was focused on catching droves of economic mice as it\nengaged the rest of the world, starting with the trade that would be liberated from our settlement\nthat week.\nThis China has done. In 1979, the U.S. imported a mere $595 million from China under onerous\ntariffs; the Chinese did not have a single dollar in official reserves. Now, they send more than\n$300 billion in goods to the U.S. and hold over $840 billion in U.S. Treasuries and agencies.\nSince Deng’s ascendancy, China has grown their economy at least 10 percent per annum, has\nbecome the world’s pivotal factory and is quickly moving to the cutting edge of technology.\nThe Chinese are survivors. During our trip to Beijing in 1979, we were treated to a soiree in the\nGreat Hall of the People on Feb. 27. The seventh act of the evening was a piano recital—a\nperformance of Liszt’s “Hungarian Fantasy No. 6”—by a haggard and emaciated pianist named\nLiu Shikun. Today, Liu is regarded as China’s finest pianist; he has performed worldwide,\nincluding with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony for one of the best-selling classical music\nalbums of all time. He had given his premiere performance at the age of 5. In 1949, at the age of\n10, he had won the Chinese National Competition for Teenagers and Children. In 1956, at the\nage of 17, he was so brilliant in his performances around the world that the Hungarian\ngovernment presented him with a lock of Liszt’s hair. He was a boy wonder, a musical genius\nwho won innumerable international competitions worldwide.\nIf you read Liu’s official Chinese biography, you will note that “he has performed in front of\nseveral generations of Chinese statesmen, including Mao Zedong…Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin\nand Hu Jintao.” What it does not tell you is that he was imprisoned during the Cultural\nRevolution and maintained his skills by carving a keyboard on the wall of his cell and playing it\nday after day, hearing its music only in his imagination. His performance for us was one of his\n3\n\n\ffirst public appearances since his “rehabilitation,” and it was so stirring that even our Chinese\nhosts, many of whom had blood on their hands, were moved to tears.\nI thought of Liu when I saw those eight People’s Liberation Army soldiers goose-step their way\nforward with the Olympic flag. They, too, are symbolic of modern China, a nation whose\nthousands of years of history have given us numerous repressive leaders.\nChina occasions an update of Winston Churchill’s famous epigram about Russia: “It is a riddle\nwrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” With China, things are not always what they seem. The\nOlympics have provided us with at least two examples of that. The fireworks in the video of the\nopening ceremonies contained computer-generated images to make the display more vivid. A\ncute-as-a-button 9-year-old girl lip-synched the national anthem being sung by a 7-year-old\nreportedly deemed not attractive enough by a member of the Politburo.\nThese enigmatic efforts to control and to bend reality to conform to image were evident during\nmy 1979 visit to China. The front page of the March 1 edition of the People’s Daily prominently\ndisplayed a photograph of Chairman Hua escorting Secretary Blumenthal, Treasury\nUndersecretary Anthony Solomon and Assistant Secretary of State Jules Katz, with me in tow,\ninto the Great Hall. A discerning viewer would have detected that the shape of our eyes had been\ndoctored by hand into almond-shaped, Chinese-like features.\nThe economic advances that put millions of Chinese in cars are real, as is the technological\nprowess on display in global markets and at the Olympics. The determination of a pianist\npracticing on a makeshift keyboard is real, as is the discipline of the goose-stepping soldiers of\nthe PLA. But here is the message: As we contemplate modern China’s impact on our economy\nand culture and national security, we must work to find the China that lies behind a carefully\ncrafted façade. Churchill concluded his alliterative “riddle, mystery and enigma” line by saying\nthat the key to getting our minds around a perplexing Russia was an understanding of her\nunderlying national interests. In contemplating China, we need to look past carefully crafted\nimages and deepen our understanding of her national interest. Failure to do so will be perilous.\nThank you.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSan Francisco, California\nMay 28, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fStorms on the Horizon\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Bruce [Ericson]. I am honored to be here this evening and am grateful for the\ninvitation to speak to the Commonwealth Club of California.\nAlan Greenspan and Paul Volcker, two of Ben Bernanke’s linear ancestors as chairmen of the\nFederal Reserve, have been in the news quite a bit lately. Yet, we rarely hear about William\nMcChesney Martin, a magnificent public servant who was Fed chairman during five presidencies\nand to this day holds the record for the longest tenure: 19 years.\nChairman Martin had a way with words. And he had a twinkle in his eye. It was Bill Martin who\nwisely and succinctly defined the Federal Reserve as having the unenviable task “to take away\nthe punchbowl just as the party gets going.” He did himself one up when he received the Alfalfa\nClub’s nomination for the presidency of the United States. I suspect many here tonight have been\nto the annual Alfalfa dinner. It is one of the great institutions in Washington, D.C. Once a year, it\nholds a dinner devoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongue firmly\nin cheek, the club nominates a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of\ncourse, none of them ever win. Nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the\nStassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time,\nthen ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of the group is Veni, Vidi,\nDefici—“I came, I saw, I lost.”\nBill Martin was nominated to run and lose on the Alfalfa Party ticket in 1966, while serving as\nFed chairman during Lyndon Johnson’s term. In his acceptance speech, 1 he announced that,\ngiven his proclivities as a central banker, he would take his cues from the German philosopher\nGoethe, “who said that people could endure anything except continual prosperity.” Therefore,\nMartin declared, he would adopt a platform proclaiming that as a president he planned to “make\nlife endurable again by stamping out prosperity.”\n“I shall conduct the administration of the country,” he said, “exactly as I have so successfully\nconducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that\ncan be found…ask their advice on all matters…and completely confound them by following all\ntheir conflicting counsel.”\nIt is true, Bruce, that as you said in your introduction, I am one of the 17 people who participate\nin Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations and provide Ben Bernanke with\n“conflicting counsel” as the committee cobbles together a monetary policy that seeks to promote\nAmerica’s economic prosperity, Goethe to the contrary. But tonight I speak for neither the\ncommittee, nor the chairman, nor any of the other good people that serve the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I speak solely in my own capacity. I want to speak to you tonight about an economic\nproblem that we must soon confront or else risk losing our primacy as the world’s most powerful\nand dynamic economy.\n1\n\nWilliam McChesney Martin, “Alfalfa Club Dinner Script,” delivered at the Alfalfa Club Dinner, Washington, D.C., Jan. 22, 1966, Box 163,\nWilliam McChesney Martin Collection, Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library, Austin, Texas.\n\n1\n\n\fForty-three years ago this Sunday, Bill Martin delivered a commencement address to Columbia\nUniversity that was far more sober than his Alfalfa Club speech. The opening lines of that\nColumbia address 2 were as follows: “When economic prospects are at their brightest, the\ndangers of complacency and recklessness are greatest. As our prosperity proceeds on its recordbreaking path, it behooves every one of us to scan the horizon of our national and international\neconomy for danger signals so as to be ready for any storm.”\nToday, our fellow citizens and financial markets are paying the price for falling victim to the\ncomplacency and recklessness Martin warned against. Few scanned the horizon for trouble\nbrewing as we proceeded along a path of unparalleled prosperity fueled by an unsustainable\nhousing bubble and unbridled credit markets. Armchair or Monday morning quarterbacks will\nlong debate whether the Fed could have/should have/would have taken away the punchbowl that\nlubricated that blowout party. I have given my opinion on that matter elsewhere and won’t go\nnear that subject tonight. What counts now is what we have done more recently and where we go\nfrom here. Whatever the sins of omission or commission committed by our predecessors, the\nBernanke FOMC’s objective is to use a new set of tools to calm the tempest in the credit markets\nto get them back to functioning in a more orderly fashion. We trust that the various term credit\nfacilities we have recently introduced are helping restore confidence while the credit markets\nundertake self-corrective initiatives and lawmakers consider new regulatory schemes.\nI am also not going to engage in a discussion of present monetary policy tonight, except to say\nthat if inflationary developments and, more important, inflation expectations, continue to worsen,\nI would expect a change of course in monetary policy to occur sooner rather than later, even in\nthe face of an anemic economic scenario. Inflation is the most insidious enemy of capitalism. No\ncentral banker can countenance it, not least the men and women of the Federal Reserve.\nTonight, I want to talk about a different matter. In keeping with Bill Martin’s advice, I have been\nscanning the horizon for danger signals even as we continue working to recover from the recent\nturmoil. In the distance, I see a frightful storm brewing in the form of untethered government\ndebt. I choose the words—“frightful storm”—deliberately to avoid hyperbole. Unless we take\nsteps to deal with it, the long-term fiscal situation of the federal government will be\nunimaginably more devastating to our economic prosperity than the subprime debacle and the\nrecent debauching of credit markets that we are now working so hard to correct.\nYou might wonder why a central banker would be concerned with fiscal matters. Fiscal policy is,\nafter all, the responsibility of the Congress, not the Federal Reserve. Congress, and Congress\nalone, has the power to tax and spend. From this monetary policymaker’s point of view, though,\ndeficits matter for what we do at the Fed. There are many reasons why. Economists have found\nthat structural deficits raise long-run interest rates, complicating the Fed’s dual mandate to\ndevelop a monetary policy that promotes sustainable, noninflationary growth. The even more\ndisturbing dark and dirty secret about deficits—especially when they careen out of control—is\nthat they create political pressure on central bankers to adopt looser monetary policy down the\n2\n\n“Does Monetary History Repeat Itself?” Commencement Day Luncheon of the Alumni Federation of Columbia University, June 1, 1965, New\nYork City.\n\n2\n\n\froad. I will return to that shortly. First, let me give you the unvarnished facts of our nation’s\nfiscal predicament.\nEight years ago, our federal budget, crafted by a Democratic president and enacted by a\nRepublican Congress, produced a fiscal surplus of $236 billion, the first surplus in almost 40\nyears and the highest nominal-dollar surplus in American history. While the Fed is scrupulously\nnonpartisan and nonpolitical, I mention this to emphasize that the deficit/debt issue knows no\nparty and can be solved only by both parties working together. For a brief time, with surpluses\nprojected into the future as far as the eye could see, economists and policymakers alike began to\ncontemplate a bucolic future in which interest payments would form an ever-declining share of\nfederal outlays, a future where Treasury bonds and debt-ceiling legislation would become dusty\nrelics of a long-forgotten past. The Fed even had concerns about how open market operations\nwould be conducted in a marketplace short of Treasury debt.\nThat utopian scenario did not last for long. Over the next seven years, federal spending grew at a\n6.2 percent nominal annual rate while receipts grew at only 3.5 percent. Of course, certain areas\nof government, like national defense, had to spend more in the wake of 9/11. But nondefense\ndiscretionary spending actually rose 6.4 percent annually during this timeframe, outpacing the\ngrowth in total expenditures. Deficits soon returned, reaching an expected $410 billion for\n2008—a $600 billion swing from where we were just eight years ago. This $410 billion estimate,\nby the way, was made before the recently passed farm bill and supplemental defense\nappropriation and without considering a proposed patch for the Alternative Minimum Tax—all\nmeasures that will lead to a further ballooning of government deficits.\nIn keeping with the tradition of rosy scenarios, official budget projections suggest this deficit\nwill be relatively short-lived. They almost always do. According to the official calculus,\nfollowing a second $400-billion-plus deficit in 2009, the red ink should fall to $160 billion in\n2010 and $95 billion in 2011, and then the budget swings to a $48 billion surplus in 2012.\nIf you do the math, however, you might be forgiven for sensing that these felicitous projections\nlook a tad dodgy. To reach the projected 2012 surplus, outlays are assumed to rise at a 2.4\npercent nominal annual rate over the next four years—less than half as fast as they rose the\nprevious seven years. Revenue is assumed to rise at a 6.7 percent nominal annual rate over the\nnext four years—almost double the rate of the past seven years. Using spending and revenue\ngrowth rates that have actually prevailed in recent years, the 2012 surplus quickly evaporates and\nbecomes a deficit, potentially of several hundred billion dollars.\nDoing deficit math is always a sobering exercise. It becomes an outright painful one when you\napply your calculator to the long-run fiscal challenge posed by entitlement programs. Were I not\na taciturn central banker, I would say the mathematics of the long-term outlook for entitlements,\nleft unchanged, is nothing short of catastrophic.\nTypically, critics ranging from the Concord Coalition to Ross Perot begin by wringing their\ncollective hands over the unfunded liabilities of Social Security. A little history gives you a view\nas to why. Franklin Roosevelt originally conceived a social security system in which individuals\nwould fund their own retirements through payroll-tax contributions. But Congress quickly\nrealized that such a system could not put much money into the pockets of indigent elderly\n3\n\n\fcitizens ravaged by the Great Depression. Instead, a pay-as-you-go funding system was\nembraced, making each generation’s retirement the responsibility of its children.\nNow, fast forward 70 or so years and ask this question: What is the mathematical predicament of\nSocial Security today? Answer: The amount of money the Social Security system would need\ntoday to cover all unfunded liabilities from now on—what fiscal economists call the “infinite\nhorizon discounted value” of what has already been promised recipients but has no funding\nmechanism currently in place—is $13.6 trillion, an amount slightly less than the annual gross\ndomestic product of the United States.\nDemographics explain why this is so. Birthrates have fallen dramatically, reducing the worker–\nretiree ratio and leaving today’s workers pulling a bigger load than the system designers ever\nenvisioned. Life spans have lengthened without a corresponding increase in the retirement age,\nleaving retirees in a position to receive benefits far longer than the system designers envisioned.\nFormulae for benefits and cost-of-living adjustments have also contributed to the growth in\nunfunded liabilities.\nThe good news is this Social Security shortfall might be manageable. While the issues regarding\nSocial Security reform are complex, it is at least possible to imagine how Congress might find,\nwithin a $14 trillion economy, ways to wrestle with a $13 trillion unfunded liability. The bad\nnews is that Social Security is the lesser of our entitlement worries. It is but the tip of the\nunfunded liability iceberg. The much bigger concern is Medicare, a program established in 1965,\nthe same prosperous year that Bill Martin cautioned his Columbia University audience to be\nwary of complacency and storms on the horizon.\nMedicare was a pay-as-you-go program from the very beginning, despite warnings from some\ncongressional leaders—Wilbur Mills was the most credible of them before he succumbed to the\npay-as-you-go wiles of Fanne Foxe, the Argentine Firecracker—who foresaw some of the longterm fiscal issues such a financing system could pose. Unfortunately, they were right.\nPlease sit tight while I walk you through the math of Medicare. As you may know, the program\ncomes in three parts: Medicare Part A, which covers hospital stays; Medicare B, which covers\ndoctor visits; and Medicare D, the drug benefit that went into effect just 29 months ago. The\ninfinite-horizon present discounted value of the unfunded liability for Medicare A is $34.4\ntrillion. The unfunded liability of Medicare B is an additional $34 trillion. The shortfall for\nMedicare D adds another $17.2 trillion. The total? If you wanted to cover the unfunded liability\nof all three programs today, you would be stuck with an $85.6 trillion bill. That is more than six\ntimes as large as the bill for Social Security. It is more than six times the annual output of the\nentire U.S. economy.\nWhy is the Medicare figure so large? There is a mix of reasons, really. In part, it is due to the\nsame birthrate and life-expectancy issues that affect Social Security. In part, it is due to evercostlier advances in medical technology and the willingness of Medicare to pay for them. And in\npart, it is due to expanded benefits—the new drug benefit program’s unfunded liability is by\nitself one-third greater than all of Social Security’s.\n\n4\n\n\fAdd together the unfunded liabilities from Medicare and Social Security, and it comes to $99.2\ntrillion over the infinite horizon. Traditional Medicare composes about 69 percent, the new drug\nbenefit roughly 17 percent and Social Security the remaining 14 percent.\nI want to remind you that I am only talking about the unfunded portions of Social Security and\nMedicare. It is what the current payment scheme of Social Security payroll taxes, Medicare\npayroll taxes, membership fees for Medicare B, copays, deductibles and all other revenue\ncurrently channeled to our entitlement system will not cover under current rules. These existing\nrevenue streams must remain in place in perpetuity to handle the “funded” entitlement liabilities.\nReduce or eliminate this income and the unfunded liability grows. Increase benefits and the\nliability grows as well.\nLet’s say you and I and Bruce Ericson and every U.S. citizen who is alive today decided to fully\naddress this unfunded liability through lump-sum payments from our own pocketbooks, so that\nall of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would\nreceive promised benefits in perpetuity. How much would we have to pay if we split the tab?\nAgain, the math is painful. With a total population of 304 million, from infants to the elderly, the\nper-person payment to the federal treasury would come to $330,000. This comes to $1.3 million\nper family of four—over 25 times the average household’s income.\nClearly, once-and-for-all contributions would be an unbearable burden. Alternatively, we could\naddress the entitlement shortfall through policy changes that would affect ourselves and future\ngenerations. For example, a permanent 68 percent increase in federal income tax revenue—from\nindividual and corporate taxpayers—would suffice to fully fund our entitlement programs. Or we\ncould instead divert 68 percent of current income-tax revenues from their intended uses to the\nentitlement system, which would accomplish the same thing.\nSuppose we decided to tackle the issue solely on the spending side. It turns out that total\ndiscretionary spending in the federal budget, if maintained at its current share of GDP in\nperpetuity, is 3 percent larger than the entitlement shortfall. So all we would have to do to fully\nfund our nation’s entitlement programs would be to cut discretionary spending by 97 percent.\nBut hold on. That discretionary spending includes defense and national security, education, the\nenvironment and many other areas, not just those controversial earmarks that make the evening\nnews. All of them would have to be cut—almost eliminated, really—to tackle this problem\nthrough discretionary spending.\nI hope that gives you some idea of just how large the problem is. And just to drive an important\npoint home, these spending cuts or tax increases would need to be made immediately and\nmaintained in perpetuity to solve the entitlement deficit problem. Discretionary spending would\nhave to be reduced by 97 percent not only for our generation, but for our children and their\nchildren and every generation of children to come. And similarly on the taxation side, income tax\nrevenue would have to rise 68 percent and remain that high forever. Remember, though, I said\ntax revenue, not tax rates. Who knows how much individual and corporate tax rates would have\nto change to increase revenue by 68 percent?\nIf these possible solutions to the unfunded-liability problem seem draconian, it’s because they\nare draconian. But they do serve to give you a sense of the severity of the problem. To be sure,\nthere are ways to lessen the reliance on any single policy and the burden borne by any particular\n5\n\n\fset of citizens. Most proposals to address long-term entitlement debt, for example, rely on a\ncombination of tax increases, benefit reductions and eligibility changes to find the trillions\nnecessary to safeguard the system over the long term.\nNo combination of tax hikes and spending cuts, though, will change the total burden borne by\ncurrent and future generations. For the existing unfunded liabilities to be covered in the end,\nsomeone must pay $99.2 trillion more or receive $99.2 trillion less than they have been currently\npromised. This is a cold, hard fact. The decision we must make is whether to shoulder a\nsubstantial portion of that burden today or compel future generations to bear its full weight.\nNow that you are all thoroughly depressed, let me come back to monetary policy and the Fed.\nIt is only natural to cast about for a solution—any solution—to avoid the fiscal pain we know is\nnecessary because we succumbed to complacency and put off dealing with this looming fiscal\ndisaster. Throughout history, many nations, when confronted by sizable debts they were unable\nor unwilling to repay, have seized upon an apparently painless solution to this dilemma:\nmonetization. Just have the monetary authority run cash off the printing presses until the debt is\nrepaid, the story goes, then promise to be responsible from that point on and hope your sins will\nbe forgiven by God and Milton Friedman and everyone else.\nWe know from centuries of evidence in countless economies, from ancient Rome to today’s\nZimbabwe, that running the printing press to pay off today’s bills leads to much worse problems\nlater on. The inflation that results from the flood of money into the economy turns out to be far\nworse than the fiscal pain those countries hoped to avoid.\nEarlier I mentioned the Fed’s dual mandate to manage growth and inflation. In the long run,\ngrowth cannot be sustained if markets are undermined by inflation. Stable prices go hand in hand\nwith achieving sustainable economic growth. I have said many, many times that inflation is a\nsinister beast that, if uncaged, devours savings, erodes consumers’ purchasing power, decimates\nreturns on capital, undermines the reliability of financial accounting, distracts the attention of\ncorporate management, undercuts employment growth and real wages, and debases the currency.\nPurging rampant inflation and a debased currency requires administering a harsh medicine. We\nhave been there, and we know the cure that was wrought by the FOMC under Paul Volcker.\nEven the perception that the Fed is pursuing a cheap-money strategy to accommodate fiscal\nburdens, should it take root, is a paramount risk to the long-term welfare of the U.S. economy.\nThe Federal Reserve will never let this happen. It is not an option. Ever. Period.\nThe way we resolve these liabilities—and resolve them we must—will affect our own well-being\nas well as the prospects of future generations and the global economy. Failing to face up to our\nresponsibility will produce the mother of all financial storms. The warning signals have been\nflashing for years, but we find it easier to ignore them than to take action. Will we take the\npainful fiscal steps necessary to prevent the storm by reducing and eventually eliminating our\nfiscal imbalances? That depends on you.\nI mean “you” literally. This situation is of your own creation. When you berate your\nrepresentatives or senators or presidents for the mess we are in, you are really berating yourself.\n6\n\n\fYou elect them. You are the ones who let them get away with burdening your children and\ngrandchildren rather than yourselves with the bill for your entitlement programs.\nThis issue transcends political affiliation. When George Shultz, one of San Francisco’s greatest\nRepublican public servants, was director of President Nixon’s Office of Management and\nBudget, he became worried about the amount of money Congress was proposing to spend. After\nsome nights of tossing and turning, he called legendary staffer Sam Cohen into his office. Cohen\nhad a long memory of budget matters and knew every zig and zag of budget history. “Sam,”\nShultz asked, “tell me something just between you and me. Is there any difference between\nRepublicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money?” Cohen looked at him, furrowed\nhis brow and, after thinking about it, replied, “Mr. Shultz, there is only one difference:\nDemocrats enjoy it more.”\nYet no one, Democrat or Republican, enjoys placing our children and grandchildren and their\nchildren and grandchildren in harm’s way. No one wants to see the frightful storm of unfunded\nlong-term liabilities destroy our economy or threaten the independence and authority of our\ncentral bank or tear our currency asunder.\nOf late, we have heard many complaints about the weakness of the dollar against the euro and\nother currencies. It was recently argued in the op-ed pages of the Financial Times 3 that one\nreason for the demise of the British pound was the need to liquidate England’s international\nreserves to pay off the costs of the Great Wars. In the end, the pound, it was essentially argued,\nwas sunk by the kaiser’s army and Hitler’s bombs. Right now, we—you and I—are launching\nfiscal bombs against ourselves. You have it in your power as the electors of our fiscal authorities\nto prevent this destruction. Please do so.\n\n3\n\n“The Euro’s Success Could Also Be Its Downfall,” by Harold James, Financial Times, May 18, 2008.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSt. Petersburg, Florida\nMay 17, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fLabor Omnia Vincit\n(Labor Conquers All Things)\nRichard W. Fisher\n\nThank you, Chairman [George] Michel. It is an honor to address the Class of ’08 here in this\nbeautiful Garden Theatre. Right off the bat, Capt. [Robert J.] Fine, I want to congratulate you\nand your staff and the students for the honor you continue to bring to David Glasgow Farragut’s\ngood name. I understand that six of this afternoon’s graduates received service academy\nappointments, another 12 received Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) scholarships and\n100 percent of the class is college bound. That is heady stuff. The hero of the Battle of Mobile\nBay would be proud.\nI want the Class of 2008 to stand up. Now turn around. Look at all these people who have come\nto celebrate your success. These are your parents, your brothers and sisters, your other relatives\nand your friends and teachers. They have been at your side through joyful moments and less\njoyful ones. They have for some 18 years encouraged you and pushed you. They have believed\nin you. And now they are here to celebrate with you your admission to the society of educated\nmen and women.\nJust as your admirers will soon applaud you, I want you to take this opportunity to applaud them.\nThank them for their love and support.\nMr. Chairman, your introduction brought back some precious memories and reminded me of the\nlong distance I have traversed since the summer of 1963, when I showed up on the banks of\nToms River on the North Campus in New Jersey, a skinny little 14-year-old, both afraid and\nexcited about the adventure that lay ahead. I was lucky to be taught by people you mentioned,\ndedicated educators like Vernie Romefeld and Stan Darby, God rest their souls, and others I hold\ndear to this day 40-odd years later. I was lucky to be coached by Stan Slaby, who badgered and\ncoerced me to excel on the playing fields, toughening me up for the challenges of life in a\nsometimes relentlessly competitive world.\nBest of all, I was lucky to have made lifelong friends there. I am delighted to see Ed DeSeta here\ntoday. He was our battalion commander, just as his son Alex would be 35 years later—the first\nfather–son battalion commander legacy in the academy’s history. For an entire academic year, I\nstood right behind Ed three times a day in parade formation as his “exec” as we drew swords,\ntook reports and marched into meals. To this day, I remember the back of his head! I am glad to\nsee it remains as noble now as it was then.\nThree other classmates are here today as well. My roommate Alex Garcias, who came from Cuba\nand zipped through Farragut’s academics like gee whiz, graduated as class vice president and as\ncommander of the First Company and went on to Vanderbilt University and a prestigious career\nas a urologist. Russ Phillips, who hailed from the small town of Finksburg, Md., and used his\nprodigious brain to win the Headmaster’s and English awards our junior year and his ample\nmuscle to play fullback on the football team, became First Company lieutenant junior grade, then\n1\n\n\fwent on to Duke and a stellar career in financial services. Robert Jauernig, a Californian who\nbecame Second Company commander, had a mind that was so quick and dynamic that we\nnicknamed him “IBM.” After Farragut, he darted off to Rensselaer Polytechnic on an ROTC\nscholarship and then on to direct the U.S. Navy’s electronic and logistical warfare needs in the\nfirst Gulf War before becoming a big deal in the New York banking community.\nLast night, Alex and Russ and Bob and I did what middle-aged men do when they gather to\nreminisce: We ate good food, drank a little wine, told lies about the women who swore they\nloved us, and recalled old friends from Admiral Farragut Academy. Most important of all, we\ndiscussed what I might say to you today.\nThe standard reflex of a commencement speaker is to troll through Bartlett’s or the Oxford\nDictionary of Quotations or Wikipedia to find something wise that puts the nobility of education\nin a glorious light. You might remember the definition of a good essay as a collection of other\npeople’s thoughts disguised to look like your own. Commencement speeches are no different.\nHoping to find something profound I might pinch and adapt to inspire you today, I wandered\nthrough abridged versions of the great minds of the ages: Socrates, Cicero, Mencius, St.\nAugustine, Voltaire, Muhammed, Martin Luther … Mae West, Jessica Simpson, Miley Cyrus.\nAlas, I found nothing that I could be certain you had not heard many times before. So I turned to\nmy three classmates.\nThey reminded me that at Farragut in the 1960s, no doubt much like it was for Chairman Michel\nin the Class of ’49, we had drilled into us those maxims that define leadership. Our favorites\ncame from the lips of heroes past:\nJohn Paul Jones, the “Father of the Navy,” described a leader as “a gentleman of liberal\neducation, refined manners, punctilious courtesy, and the nicest sense of personal honor.”\nThe immortal Winston Churchill said: “Never give in, never, never, never, never—in nothing,\ngreat or small, large or petty—never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense.\nNever yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.”\nRobert E. Lee said, “Never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one.”\nAnd Gen. George Patton wisely advised that a leader should “Never”—these Great Men sure like\nto use the word “never”—“tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will\nsurprise you with their ingenuity.”\nAfter a wee bit too much cabernet, Russ Phillips came up with this, which is thought to be from\nGen. Norman Schwarzkopf: “Going to war without France is like going deer hunting without\nyour accordion.” (I’ll have to use my leadership skills and tell Russ to surprise everyone with his\ningenuity by sticking to his current successful career and not turn to speechwriting).\nEvery commencement speaker at every school and university, including Gen. Schwarzkopf, will\ndispense pretty much the same advice over the next few weeks of commencements: Be\ndisciplined; be prepared; be loyal, brave and thrifty; don’t waste your talents; take risks; push the\nenvelope; respect your fellow men and women; serve others; never compromise your integrity;\n2\n\n\fto thine own self be true and be true to community and country; give back when others have\ngiven to you; promise no more than you can deliver; stick to your obligations; never—there it is\nagain—never forget you have talent to do good; never, never, never, never give up the pursuit of\nexcellence.\nGreat words of wisdom can inspire us. And yet they do not determine who we are or what we\nmight become. Character comes from our upbringing and our experiences—and it is on this very\npersonal level that I want to address the seniors who will soon walk out of Admiral Farragut\nAcademy with diploma in hand.\nI have been in your shoes. At 14, I was shipped off to Farragut North. It was, frankly, a tough\nand unforgiving place. Trust me: It had nothing as pretty as this Garden Theatre in this sunny\nenclave of St. Petersburg. When the wind howled off of Toms River in wintertime, it felt colder\nthan the dark side of Pluto. Capt. Fine’s counterpart, our headmaster, was named Raven O.\nDodge. He was a stern man. He had one arm. We lived in fear of him. But we respected him,\neven if the boyish wits on the swim team called him “Sidestroke” behind his back.\nWe rose at 6:15 every morning, mustered out to the parade field for inspection and marched to\nbreakfast in formation. We had morning classes and then formed up and marched to lunch with\nour drum and bugle corps. After lunch came more classes, then activities and sports at 3:30. And\nthen, for the last time of the day, we formed up and marched to dinner at 6. We went straight to\nour rooms after dinner to do homework before lights-out at 10. On weekends, we had full-dress\nparades. We learned how to handle weapons and, being at a naval academy prep school, how to\ntie knots and navigate by the stars.\nIn those days, Farragut was an all-male school. My buddies back home thought I was nuts. They\nwere with their families, dating good-looking girls, driving cars, spending money, having fun,\nsleeping late and doing things in their own sweet time. I was in New Jersey for four years,\nmarching to meals, studying hard, leading a highly disciplined life and getting by on a $2-a-week\nallowance. We got $5 a week as seniors, but it didn’t make a whole lot of difference because we\nonly got out on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. My life and my friends’ lives were as different\nas night and day. Sound familiar?\nAnd yet, I wouldn’t go back and change any of it—even with the hindsight gained in the 45\nyears since I showed up on the doorstep of Farragut Hall. I wouldn’t change any of it because the\nlessons I learned in those four years made it possible for me to accomplish all those things that\nGeorge Michel bragged on earlier. We learned to internalize—to come by as instinct—all those\nattributes mentioned so eloquently in those great leaders’ words I cited earlier. We learned the\nvalues of punctilious courtesy, sticking to conviction, never wronging a friend or bowing to\noverwhelming odds. We learned that semper fidelis—being always faithful to your country, your\nmission and your own potential—is reward in and of itself.\nWe also learned a lesson that is quintessentially unique to naval academy prep schools. When\nyou wear a uniform and you live in the same dorms and eat the same food in the same place,\nnobody cares whether you are rich or poor or where you or your parents come from. I was the\nson of immigrants. My father never got past fourth grade; my mother was a secretary. Alex\nGarcias was a Cuban immigrant whose mother survived by waiting tables when she first landed\non our shores. Bob Jauernig was an Army brat. Russ Phillips was a country boy from Finksburg.\n3\n\n\fWe were at school with a lot of rich boys from Manhattan and other tony places who had fancier\nbloodlines, but it didn’t make a bit of difference. You moved up in rank according to your effort\nand achievement. You got what you earned and you earned what you got.\nI can’t tell you how many times people now ask me: Just how did you get to Annapolis and to\nHarvard and all those fancy schools? How did you end up on Wall Street, make money, become\nan ambassador and do all those high-sounding things in Washington? How did you end up\nworking with Henry Kissinger? And how did you end up sitting at the table with Alan Greenspan\nand Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve? What’s your secret?\nAn honest answer requires the ultimate disclaimer that it helps to have good luck on your side—\nserendipity comes in mighty handy. I have had way more than my share of it. But I believe that\nthe lessons and disciplines learned at Farragut, just like those you have learned, are what allowed\nme to make the most of that good luck.\nAs to the secret, you can forget all those quotes from musty, dusty men of the past. I’m going to\ngive it straight to you from the ultimate source: Oprah Winfrey. As accomplished an American\nas you will ever find, she says it best: “The big secret in life is that there is no big secret.\nWhatever your goal, you can get there if you’re willing to work.”\nThat hits the nail on the head. You need to dream of big things. But dreaming will not suffice. To\nsucceed, you must work. If you are willing to work hard, you will achieve your goals. That is all\nyou need to remember of this graduation speech. That, and the sound advice that you should\nnever, never, never, never … go deer hunting with an accordion.\n\n4\n\n\f"

        "content": "Selling Our Services to the World\n(With an Ode to Chicago)\nRemarks before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nChicago\nApril 17, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fSelling Our Services to the World\n(With an Ode to Chicago)\nBy Richard W. Fisher\nThank you, Charlie [Evans, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]. And\nthank you, Mike Moskow for inviting me to speak to the Chicago Council. We miss you, Mike.\nFor 13 years you brought not only wisdom but élan to that big mahogany table at the Fed, and\nnone of us can quite fill that gap. The measure of a successful leader, however, is who he picks\nas his replacement, and with Charlie, you hit a home run.\nI especially appreciate Charlie’s mentioning my modest book collection. Part of that collection\nconsists of documents and writings of British prime ministers. One of my favorites is Gladstone.\nHe used to say that “only love has made more fools of men than contemplating the nature of\nmoney.” Yet, that is precisely what Charlie Evans and I and Ben Bernanke and our colleagues at\nthe Federal Reserve do: We spend practically every waking hour contemplating the nature of\nmoney and the proper shape and conduct of our monetary system. So if you detect an air of\ndistraction in Charlie Evans now and then, be kind. He has not gone mad or foolish on us; he is\njust hard at work noodling through our predicament and conjuring up Chicago’s\nrecommendations on what we at the Federal Open Market Committee should do.\nLast week in San Antonio, I provided my perspective on the situation we now encounter in a\nmarketplace entering the early stages of recovery from a period of excess, indiscriminate\nbehavior and historical (and occasionally hysterical) amnesia, and on the efforts we at the\nFederal Reserve are making to calmly and prudently restore the efficacy of the financial markets.\nI said then—and I assert again today—that there is nothing “unprecedented” about the situation\nwe find ourselves in. To illustrate the point, I want to read a passage from Washington Irving’s\n1819 essay on the Mississippi Bubble.1 For those of you who think the recent housing bubble\nand the ensuing financial imbroglio are “unprecedented,” listen to these words penned almost\n200 years ago:\n“Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when\nthe ‘credit system’…expands to full luxuriance: everybody trusts everybody; a\nbad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies\nplain and open…. Banks…become so many mints to coin words into cash; and as\nthe supply of words is inexhaustible, it may readily be supposed what a vast\namount of promissory capital is soon in circulation…. Nothing is heard but\ngigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and\nimmense sums made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but\nthe believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital….\n“Now is the time for speculative and dreaming or designing men. They relate their\ndreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, [and] dazzle them with golden\nvisions…. The example of one stimulates another; speculation rises on\nspeculation; bubble rises on bubble…. No ‘operation’ is thought worthy of\nattention, that does not double or treble the investment…. Could this delusion\n1\n\n\falways last, the life of a merchant would indeed be a golden dream; but it is as\nshort as it is brilliant.”\nAnd to think, Washington Irving had never met a subprime mortgage, or a CDO, a CLO, an SIV\nor a credit default swap! It is indeed true that those who ignore history are condemned to repeat\nit. That is the bad news. Financiers, “dazzle[ing] the credulous,” including regulators, repeated\nhistory in spades, despite their claim to unprecedentedly clever and new risk-management tools\nand mathematical sophistication. It was as short as it was momentarily “brilliant.” But that is\ndone, and now we must do what we can to remedy the situation. One thing, however, is clear.\nThe answer, to be curt, is not to compound the bad by repeating the oft-prescribed remedy of\ninflating our way out of our predicament with a wing-and-a-prayer promise that it can always be\nreined in later. It is for this reason that I have maintained a strong reluctance to further general\nmonetary accommodation. At the same time, I have been an advocate of using our various\ndiscount window facilities, within reason, to bridge the financial system’s structural problems as\nthe credit markets correct themselves and run the long course of contrition.\nEnough of that pleasantry. That is not what I came to speak about today. I don’t know about you,\nbut I am weary of the woeful stuff that is constantly blaring from our newspapers and television\nsets and the Net, compounded as it is in the throes of a presidential election. Today, I would like\nto talk about something more uplifting—about the good news documented in another of my\nfavorite books, the Dallas Fed’s annual report, which we have placed on each of your chairs and\nwill be releasing to the public after this luncheon.\nI hail from one of those growing, prosperous Sunbelt cities that has burst forth as a center of U.S.\neconomic growth in the past generation or two. Dallas is now the hub of the nation’s sixth largest\nmetropolitan area, which joins the fifth largest metropolitan area in Houston and the ninth largest\nin the San Antonio–Austin region to form the economic backbone of a thriving state powered by\nthe gumption of 24 million hard-working, hardscrabble souls. To be sure, our economy is\nlubricated by a robust energy industry. But it percolates on technology and information. I believe\nthat my hometown of Dallas can serve as a microcosm for our nation’s tectonic shift from\nproducing goods to producing services.\nBy Chicago standards, we Texans may be nouveau riche. But as my father used to say, “It is\nbetter to be nouveaux riche than not riche at all.” Lest you forget, back at the end of the 19th\ncentury, when Dallas and Houston and San Antonio and Austin were just a twinkle in our\nancestors’ eyes, Chicago was considered equally nouveaux and brash by the folks in New York.\nIt was that brashness that transformed Chicago from what Carl Sandburg described as “hog\nbutcher for the world, tool maker, stacker of wheat, player with railroads and the nation’s freight\nhandler” into one of the great cities and a cutting- edge center of finance- and information-based\nprogress. You have repeatedly used your riches to evolve your economy, setting an example not\njust for Dallas but for all of America.\nWith each passing year, the U.S. economy relies less on the production of agricultural and\nfactory goods and more on services to fulfill the American Dream. Today, four-fifths of our jobs\nare in services, a sprawling and diverse sector that includes janitors and cashiers and fast-food\ncooks, as well as bank presidents and college professors, software “geeks,” architects and\nfilmmakers, chemical engineers and bioengineers, doctors and their nemeses, lawyers. Imagine\nthis: In 2005, there were more or less the same number of people employed in the legal services\n2\n\n\fprofession as there were in the auto manufacturing sector, yet lawyers contributed twice as much\nof the value added to our GDP as the automobile manufacturers. We are a service-sector-driven\neconomy, plain and simple.\nIn 1950, the height of America’s Industrial Age, Chicago had 42 percent of its workforce in\nmanufacturing, mining and construction, a share significantly above the rest of the country.\nToday, industry as we knew it then accounts for just 17 percent of the Windy City’s job base, a\nnumber below the national average. The remaining 83 percent are in services, putting the city\nslightly above the national average.\nWith this remarkable shift from industry to services, Chicago’s economy has continued to grow,\non net adding nearly 400,000 jobs in the past quarter century. A great many of them are highpaying service-sector positions, putting Chicago 11th among the nation’s 280 metropolitan areas\nin household income. That’s in the top 4 percent.\nThe more adaptable cities are—the more able and willing to remake their economies as times\nchange—the better they do. In his 1916 poem, Sandburg portrayed the raw energy of an\nemerging industrial giant that was constantly building, breaking up and rebuilding. The\neconomic way of life that defined that era of furious industrial activity may be ebbing or even\nlost to new industrial sites in China or Eastern Europe, but the fierce desire to keep moving\nforward has survived and, with it, Chicago’s claim to being a vibrant, top-ranking world city.\nOld Chicago, perhaps better than young Dallas or the other new cities of the Sunbelt, provides a\nperfect template for success in today’s era of globalization. The United States, like Chicago, can\ncontinue to prosper only if it faces economic change head-on, choosing to compete rather than\nretreat, seeking out new opportunities in a globalizing economy, where goods, services, money\nand ideas flow freely across international borders.\nOne of these opportunities—maybe the best one—lies in exporting services. The Dallas Fed\nexplores this subject in its keynote essay in this year’s annual report, titled “Opportunity Knocks:\nSelling Our Services to the World.”2 I urge each of you to read it. Apart from making you feel a\nbit better about this country’s economic future in a globalized and highly competitive world, it\nmight give you some insight into which service industries are likely to outperform others as\nglobal demand expands, and why.\nLet me take you inside our report, starting with a look into the typical buying patterns of\nconsumers—be they Americans, Chinese or South Africans. Data from nearly all parts of the\nworld show us that consumers tend to spend relatively less on goods and more on services as\ntheir incomes rise. You might think of a shopping list. At the top of it are life’s necessities, led\nby the traditional triumvirate of food, clothing and shelter, followed by all sorts of household\nitems, from knives and forks to furniture and appliances, and so on. These are largely goods.\nOnce people have met their basic needs, they tend to want medical care, transportation and\ncommunication, information, recreation, entertainment, financial and legal advice, and the like.\nIn short, with increasing prosperity, consumers shift to spending a higher percentage of their\nmoney on services. Many services, of course, are customized and delivered directly to clients;\nthey are largely knowledge and information. In the Internet age, this intellectual output can be\ncarved up into bits and bytes and sent nearly anywhere on this planet in a few seconds for a few\npennies.\n3\n\n\fIn the United States, we shifted our buying from goods to services as we grew richer. Other rich\ncountries have done the same. There is no reason to believe that the next group of countries\nclimbing the income ladder will behave any differently. That brings us to China and India, two\npopulous nations that in the past decade have stirred from a long slumber and taken off on fastgrowth paths. As they’ve opened up to the rest of the world, 2.5 billion consumers have been\nadded to the world economy.\nMany commentators portray the emergence of China and India as a threat. We hear about a flood\nof Chinese manufactured goods costing U.S. factory jobs. We hear about the outsourcing of jobs\nto India eroding U.S. service industries. These are actual phenomena. But it is also true—and this\nwe rarely hear about—that these and other emerging countries are not just selling to world\nmarkets, they are buying from them, too. Imports as a share of China’s economy more than\ndoubled in the past decade to 33 percent. India’s import share has tripled to 23 percent.\nTo a Dallasite or a Chicagoan, that is the sound of opportunity knocking. Let me give you a few\nexamples. At forecasted growth rates, we calculate that China will add $116 billion to world\ndemand for medical care in just one year. India will contribute an additional $25 billion.\nTogether, the incremental demand for medical care from just these two markets will be more\nthan four times larger than the contribution from the U.S. Turning to global spending on\nrecreational services, one year’s added demand comes to $79 billion from China and $16 billion\nfrom India, compared with $23 billion from the U.S. Down the line, these gains should be even\nbigger, provided China and India continue to grow their economies.\nNow throw in all the services beyond medical care and recreation. Then consider the world\nbeyond China and India, a mix of emerging nations and traditional markets, most seeing their\nincomes rise. This is new business. Their domestic producers will meet a good chunk of the\nadded demand, but China, India and other countries will shop the globe for what they cannot find\nat home or what is better elsewhere. Here, we have advantages in many areas. Medicine, finance,\neducation, legal services, forensics, architecture and design, engineering technology, film and\nother aspects of entertainment—in these service areas and more, America is second to none.\nTo be sure, we must compete with the Brits, the Europeans, the Japanese, the Aussies and\neveryone else for this business. But U.S. firms have already proven to be stellar at selling their\nservices to the world. We already export more services than any other nation—by a long shot.\nOur foreign sales of nearly $500 billion in 2007 exceeded the combined total of the next two\nservices exporters, Britain and Germany. Better still, most of what we sell abroad are highly\nvalued services—and the numbers prove it.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis divvies up services exports into 20 categories. In three-fourths\nof them, U.S. exports exceed imports. Our edge is nearly 24 to 1 in industrial engineering, which\nincludes American technicians who install computerized control systems, design industrial\nrobots and streamline supply chains. Marquees all over the world tout our movies, and we have a\n13-to-1 trade ratio in the distribution of films and television shows. We are crackerjack suppliers\nof construction services, information management, legal and financial services, and education.\nBecause of our deep reservoir of copyrights and patents, what we receive from foreigners in\nlicensing fees and royalties exceeds what we pay to other countries by better than 2 to 1.\n4\n\n\fAll told, our service exports exceed imports in 15 of 20 categories. In 10 categories, our service\nexports are more than double our imports—some exceeding even 10 times as much, such as\nmedical services, TV and film, and industrial engineering. In only two service categories are our\nimports more than double our exports—freight and insurance.\nThe United States developed its services prowess here at home. Our companies learned how to\ndeliver services efficiently and effectively by meeting the needs of a highly sophisticated,\nevolving domestic economy. To fill the ranks of these companies, our colleges and universities\neducated doctors, lawyers, architects and managers. The next logical step has always been to sell\nthis expertise to foreign customers.\nWe should not overlook the revolution in communications and information technology that has\nspread around the world in the past two decades, a revolution that was conceived and delivered\nand nurtured to maturity in the laboratories and universities of the United States. The economics\ntextbooks I had in college told me it was far easier to export goods than services. Physical things\ncould be mass produced, crated, put on ships, warehoused and sold abroad. Most services, in\ncontrast, had to be delivered directly to clients. They faced obstacles in export markets largely\nbecause of technological limitations and the high costs involved with communications, travel and\ninformation transmittal.\nThese barriers to services trade have been crumbling. The story goes back to the late 1960s, with\nthe Defense Department’s project for decentralizing communications, which a few decades later\ngrew into the Internet we know today. In the mid-1970s, the two Steves—Jobs and Wozniak—\nsold their first Apple I, the first step toward the desktops and laptops that keep today’s businesses\nhumming. Information Age technology expands the range of services that can be delivered over\ngreat distances. It makes it cheaper and easier to find and interact with customers overseas.\nThe upshot is changing trading patterns. The growth rate for U.S. exports was faster for goods\nthan services until the early 1980s. Then, foreign sales of services began rising faster than goods.\nSince 1985, our services exports have grown nearly 260 percent, eclipsing the 200 percent\ngrowth in goods exports. Today, services represent nearly 30 percent of our overseas sales.\nWe can expect our trade to continue its transition from goods to services. I assure you this is\nindeed good news, particularly welcome at a time of widespread anxiety about creating good\njobs and maintaining high and growing median income levels. Exporting more services will help\nus do both.\nToo often, services get a bad rap. The hamburger-flipper stereotype of services jobs would have\nus believe that they are innately and unalterably inferior to goods-producing jobs. That simply is\nnot true. Yes, there are low-paying jobs in services, just as there are low-paying ones in goods,\nbut the average services worker today makes more than the average factory worker. If we look\nback to 1990, we see that hourly wages have grown faster in services than manufacturing for all\nservice categories except transportation and warehousing.\nAverage manufacturing earnings stood at $16.40 an hour in 2007, excluding overtime. Finance,\ninsurance and real estate workers earned $19.66 an hour. Professional and business services were\nat $20.14 an hour and information services at $23.92 an hour. Utilities paid their workers $27.93.\nOnly retail trade and leisure and hospitality paid significantly less than manufacturing in 2007—\n5\n\n\fand these are industries that for the most part don’t require advanced skills and employ large\nnumbers of students and many young people just starting their careers.\nProductivity determines pay. And America’s services workers are among the world’s most\nproductive, with an average worker’s output at $80,000. U.S. services providers are productive\nbecause they’re well educated and highly skilled. The capital of our times is human, not\nmechanical. Yesterday’s factory workers brought strong backs, steady eyes and sure hands to the\nproduction process, while the capitalist provided the buildings and machinery. Today’s service\ncompanies may provide office space and computers, but the workers create value with their\nminds. The engine of the knowledge economy can be found not in sooty factories but atop our\nnecks: It is the human brain. This is particularly true of the services we export, which skew\ntoward the highly sophisticated output of well-educated and skilled workers.\nEconomic theory tells us that nations will export what can be produced by factors they have in\nrelative abundance. This is the principle of comparative advantage. Countries with significant\nmineral wealth will sell oil or copper. Those with large tracts of fertile land will sell wheat, corn\nor beef. Those with cheap labor and large stocks of machinery—think China—will sell run-ofthe-mill factory goods. America’s highly knowledgeable and experienced services workers are\nour nation’s relatively abundant factor. That is what we sell to the world. That is where our\nfuture lies.\nAnother of my favorite prime ministers was Winston Churchill. In the early years of the 20th\ncentury, Britain had a donnybrook of a debate—with Churchill and his free traders pitted against\nJoseph Chamberlain and the protectionists. Churchill saw how global competition would push a\nnation to make higher value-added products. Here is how he put it: “The country in which the\nsuperfine processes are performed—in which the superfine, the most complicated terminal stages\nof manufacture are performed—is the country which possesses what may be called commercial\n‘leadership.’ ” Today, I would broaden Churchill’s words to emphasize services and find\ncommercial leadership in nations, like ours, that possess the talents and experience needed to\nprovide the highest-valued services.\nThe answer to competition from the new countries that have joined the capitalist race is not to\nwrap ourselves in the toxic, defensive mantle of protectionism. That is akin to embracing\ninflation as a remedy to the credit market correction. The answer is to go on the offensive, to\nmaster and dominate the “superfine processes.” We must continue climbing the value-added\nladder into the most profitable and productive services. We must exploit this competitive\nadvantage, so we can continue growing our economy and expanding the welfare of our citizens.\nWe in Dallas, like you here in Chicago, are working diligently to sell our services to the rest of\nthe world. Progressive cities all over this great country are making yet another sweeping\ntransition—this time, to thinking and acting globally in the services arena—that promises to pave\na path that will allow us to remain the world’s premier economy for many, many years to come.\nCharlie, let me conclude by going back to my books and quoting another Charlie—Charles Eliot,\nwho was Harvard’s president for 40 years. He once said, “Books are the quietest and most\nconstant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors and the most patient of\nteachers.” I hope that in the essay you will find in the little, accessible book that is our annual\n6\n\n\freport some wise counsel and a quiet but reassuring ray of sunshine for this otherwise dark and\nimpatient world.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES\n1\n\nWashington Irving, “A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,” The Crayon Papers: The Great Mississippi Bubble\n(1819–1820).\n2\n\nW.

        "content": "The Egocentricity of the Present\n(Prefaced by the Tale of Ruth and Emma)\nRemarks before a Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Community Forum\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSan Antonio, Texas\nApril 9, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fThe Egocentricity of the Present\n(Prefaced by the Tale of Ruth and Emma)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Dick. I admire Dick Evans for many reasons. He is a smart banker. He is a devoted\nSan Antonian. He is a superb member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ board of directors.\nAnd he is married to Jimmie Ruth, who is living proof that men, even Dick Evans, can always be\nimproved upon.\nThe name Ruth evokes memories of my godmother, Ruth Walgren, who had a vivid sense of\nhumor. She lived to a very ripe old age and used to tell a story that went something like this:\nTwo women, Ruth and Emma, lived well into their 90s, surviving their husbands and practically\nall their friends in their little town. They had been best friends all their lives, growing up just a\nfew doors from each other and living just a few blocks apart since childhood. Age finally caught\nup with Ruth. In her final hours she told Emma: “You know what I remember most fondly?\nSoftball. My favorite thing in my long life was playing softball when we were girls. We were\ncarefree and happy and everything was just so perfect. Oh, Emma, I pray there is a softball team\nin heaven.”\n“My dear and oldest friend,” Emma said, “I loved playing softball too. If there is softball in\nheaven, will you send me a signal and let me know?”\n“I will, I promise,” said Ruth, and with that she smiled, closed her eyes and passed on.\nSeveral weeks later, on a Sunday night, Emma was peacefully lying in her bed. Suddenly a flash\nof intense light hovered above her bed. Ruth appeared as an angel. “Emma,” she said, “I have\ngood news and I have bad news.”\n“Oh, Ruthie,” Emma said, “tell me the good news.”\n“The good news, Emma, is that there is a softball team in heaven! All of our friends from\ngirlhood are here and so are our old teammates. We are all carefree girls again. We play all day\nin perfect weather. We never get tired. And we are happy, happy, happy and will be for eternity.\nIt is truly heavenly.”\n“Oh, Ruth, that is so wonderful,” Emma replied. “What better news could I have received on this\nfine Sunday night? What could possibly be the bad news?”\n“Well,” said Ruth, “the bad news is you are pitching on Tuesday.”\nSo often, just when all seems so good and just right, we receive an abrupt warning that things are\nabout to change, that we are going to be yanked from our comfortable existence and into the\nunknown. At that moment, we realize we have been enjoying a false sense of comfort. The\noutlook suddenly becomes less certain, even bleak, and we panic, wondering just how to deal\nwith our new predicament. This is especially true in economics.\n1\n\n\fLast Thursday, the Financial Times published a pithy little letter by Alex Pollock, a resident\nfellow of the American Enterprise Institute, questioning the assertion of a column written some\ndays earlier about the financial markets that had stated “we are in unknown territory facing\nsituations that have never arisen before.” Pollock’s response was that the current bursting of the\nhousing bubble exhibits time-honored boom–bust traditions. And then he penned this zinger: “In\nbooms it is proclaimed that we are in a ‘new era’—in busts that we have ‘unprecedented\nproblems.’ This is merely the egocentricity of the present.”\nI would like to talk today about the “egocentricity of the present” as it relates to the economy.\nWhat is the nature of the bubble we have experienced and what are the dynamics of the bust?\nHow is it affecting Texas? What is the proper role of the Federal Reserve in dealing with the\nsituation? And what might Texans do about it?\nTo begin, we need to spend a moment pondering the nature of risk. Perceptions of risk lie in the\neye of the beholder. Some see risk as a powerful force vital to capitalism; others consider it a\nfour-letter word. The latter view may be gaining currency these days, as risks taken in housing\nfinance have led to considerable stress in financial markets and weakness in the overall\neconomy.\nWe must not forget that prudent risk taking is the lifeblood of capitalism, especially in the\nAmerican form of capitalism where we are constantly replacing the old with the new, and the\nfamiliar with the new and the innovative. If we had not taken risks, we would never have created\nfrom scratch the $14 trillion U.S. economy.\nEvery one of us takes risks to advance our interests. A young person who goes to college, for\nexample, risks the certain income from today’s job, believing in the probability of a better paying\none after graduation. As we accumulate excess savings, we place them at risk by investing in\nstocks and bonds to secure our retirement. We take risks by borrowing to build our businesses,\nwith the expectation that a brighter future will enable us to repay our debts and then some.\nOf course, we also strive to manage risk. Once we are in the workforce, life insurance, for\nexample, hedges the risk that we might die before we have socked away enough money to\nprovide for our families. A prudent banker like Dick Evans drills down into the businesses he is\nlending to and knows them like the back of his hand in order to minimize risks to his short-term\ndepositors from providing businesses with long-term financing. And so on.\nThe necessity of risk taking as a pillar of market capitalism has also given rise to agents to\nservice it. Insurers and banks are two such agents, as are investment banks, money managers,\nhedge funds and other financial intermediaries that provide the means to assess, package and\ndistribute risk. In the old days, their job was fairly straightforward. The agents packaged straightup risk instruments like letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper, simple loans\nand stocks, life and property insurance and fixed-rate mortgages. More recently, with the aid of\ntechnology and computational power that can assess probabilities at lightning speeds, the menu\nof risk instruments expanded dramatically. Financial intermediaries began offering exotic\nproducts to satisfy almost any risk taker’s needs anywhere in the world at any time. Hunger for\nthe new risk products was stimulated by a lengthy period of abnormally low interest rates and the\n2\n\n\fnormal human instinct to look for ever-higher yields when the returns on orthodox financial\ninstruments, like U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds or bank CDs, become ho-hum.\nOf course, like exotic foods, consumption of new risk products can lead to indigestion, and even\nallergic reactions. Lately, we have witnessed many allergic reactions—in the form of losses and\nsetbacks—especially among money center banks and other financial institutions whose fiduciary\neyes—as old Ruth Walgren would have said—“simply got too big for their stomachs.” What\nbegan as isolated pockets of trouble in the U.S. housing market soon spread to global markets in\nmortgage-backed securities, where many of the exotic home mortgage products were gobbled up.\nSoon it became obvious that financial market participants were gagging on the many types of\n“structured” credit products—not just those backed by mortgages—they were being served. As\nwe approached the summer of 2007, this gag reflex reached a pinnacle; the larger banks found it\ndifficult, if not impossible, to sell to others many types of loans; and the interbank lending\nmarket experienced intense liquidity pressures as banks became fearful of lending to each other\nfor longer than overnight.\nJust when things seemed so comfortable, when we were so happy as an economy, it is as though\nwe settled down for a peaceful night’s sleep on a Sunday night this past August, only to learn we\nwould be called to pitch on Tuesday, but with less pleasant prospects than those of our fictional\nfriend Emma. We’ve seen yet another historical cycle of excess risk-taking—in this case,\nconcentrated in financial innovations in credit and structured finance served up and consumed\nwithout regard for the downside—followed by extreme risk aversion.\nThis round of speculation and financial amnesia seems to have been driven by a combination of\nfactors, including an over-reliance on statistical models and rating agencies, excessive liquidity\nand perverse incentives compounded by an excess of complacency.\nIn assessing the situation, don’t let anyone convince you that we’ve entered a “new era.” The\ndetails may be different, but we’ve been here before. Allow me to temper the ego of the present\nby recalling the not-too-distant past and the events that happened right here in Texas.\nIn the 1980s, the euphoria of oil prices around $100 a barrel in today’s dollars led to a frenzy of\nlending activity in Texas. At least I think that’s what any reasonable observer would call the\nannual growth rate of business loans of over 40 percent at Texas banks and annual growth in\ncommercial real estate lending of almost 50 percent that we saw in the early part of that decade.\nBooking assets at such a rapid clip has a seductive power. My favorite line from the musical\n“Evita” is when she belts out, “All I want is a whole lot of excess!” Well, we certainly pursued\nexcess here in the 1980s. In pursuit of a seemingly sure thing, more than 550 new banks were\nchartered in Texas from 1980 through 1985. This made for a volatile brew, combining dramatic\nrates of growth in activity with a dramatic expansion of the number of players with limited\nexperience in knowing what to do when things go wrong. The assumption of permanently high,\nor permanently rising, prices in an asset class—in this case, oil—invariably leads to regrettable\ndecisions.\nYou recall what ensued. Real oil prices began to fall, contributing to an economic slowdown in\nthe region’s most energy-sensitive areas, such as Houston. The regional economy held its own\nfor a while, propelled by a red-hot commercial real estate sector. The state economy suffered a\nsevere decline, however, when oil collapsed to the current equivalent of around $22 per barrel by\n3\n\n\fmid-1986. Bank and thrift failures reached a frightful magnitude. More than 800 financial\ninstitutions went out of business in Texas during the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Nine of the\n10 largest banking organizations based in Texas didn’t make it—the exception being Dick\nEvans’ Cullen Frost.\nThe energy bust reverberated through Texas, and it was keenly felt in both commercial and\nresidential real estate markets. Office vacancies soared. In Dallas and Houston, they hovered\naround 30 percent, and they approached 40 percent in Austin. Employment growth flatlined and\nrecession ensued.\nThe nation’s current difficulties took root not in the oil market, but in the U.S. housing market.\nAfter several years of startling increases in home prices and financing activity, things began to\nunravel several quarters ago. But the roots of the current crisis were like those of earlier bubbles.\nThey originated in the seductive power of price escalation—of a “whole lot of excess”—and the\negocentricity of the present, which led some to believe we had entered a “new era.” We either\ndidn’t notice this elaborate conceit or failed to deal with it. But it was there. Many coastal areas\nof the U.S. were beginning to see 20 to 30 percent year-over-year increases in house prices, some\neven as high as 30 to 40 percent. Subprime mortgage borrowing, or lending to less creditworthy\nindividuals by lenders who were eager to finance a “sure thing,” exploded. The good news is that\nlevels of homeownership among the U.S. population reached unprecedented heights, extending\nthe American dream to more people than ever before. The bad news is that the methods used to\ndo so were not sustainable.\nLet me give you some numbers to focus the mind. In 1999, before home prices started to defy\ngravity, 55 percent of homes sold in the New York metro area were considered affordable to the\nmedian-income family by one industry gauge. When home prices peaked at the end of 2006, that\npercentage had fallen to just 5 percent. In Los Angeles in 1999, 43 percent of homes were\naffordable to the median-income family, but only 2 percent were by the end of 2006. Two\npercent! Compare that to Texas. In Dallas in 1999, 64 percent of homes were affordable, by 2006\nthat percentage had barely slipped to 62 percent. In Austin, home prices actually became more\naffordable over this period, in contrast to the U.S. as a whole.\nThe chairman of Presidents Nixon and Ford’s Council of Economic Advisers, Herb Stein, was\nfond of saying that, “if something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” Eventually the conceit of a\n“new era” in housing could not go on forever, and it stopped. The bubble popped, and a harsh\ncorrection has ensued.\nWith that abridged historical background, let’s turn back to the financial markets. We saw a\nwave of innovative mortgage products during the housing boom. Indeed, there would have been\nno other way for many borrowers to have procured financing without these new mortgage\nproducts.\nThese innovations in financing took two forms. First, credit-scoring models enabled lenders to\nbetter sort and price mortgages made to nonprime borrowers. The second set of innovations\nallowed these loans to be funded and sold to a new class of investors. While traditional\nmortgages had long been securitized and sold through government-sponsored enterprises such as\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the securitization market ushered in new players from the private\n4\n\n\fsector who would hold nonprime mortgages that could not meet the standards of Fannie and\nFreddie and that banks would generally not hold in portfolios.\nThese so-called structured credit products became all the rage with investors. These new and\ncomplex securities sliced and diced risk into different tranches. It was thought that the\ncollateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations could be hedged with credit\ndefault swaps to make them seem almost risk free. And, if you could do so with mortgage loans,\nwhy not credit card loans, auto loans and other types of debt?\nThings began to unravel once it became apparent that the housing bubble could not expand\nforever. Losses began to be recorded on traditional mortgage-backed securities, with the newer\ntypes of structured finance products used to securitize the newer types of mortgage lending being\nespecially hard hit. It didn’t stop there. Banks in other countries that had invested in the toogood-to-be-true U.S. housing market through these products began to record large losses. Even\nsome that weren’t directly involved in the U.S. housing sector or these products still felt the\nrepercussions; who could have imagined that house price declines in the U.S. would contribute to\na bank run in England?\nAll types of structured credit products soon came under suspicion. Issuance of asset-backed\ncommercial paper declined sharply beginning last summer. Although some of that paper was\nbacked by mortgages, not all of it was. But that didn’t seem to matter. The market for auction\nrate municipal bonds was also hit, as doubts spread regarding the financial health of the\nmisnamed “monoline” insurers. Investment banks also experienced abnormal difficulties in the\nusually routine task of syndicating their leveraged loans in the private equity sphere, which is\nfairly remote from the mortgage industry, to say the least.\nThe banking industry was smack in the middle of this maelstrom. This sector is of obvious\nimportance to the Federal Reserve. Not surprisingly, large losses have been recorded at some of\nthe largest banks. Their capital ratios are also under pressure from the fallout in the securitization\nmarkets. The difficulty in selling loans and the increase in lending to borrowers who were shut\nout of the securitization markets have increased banks’ exposure. In addition, some banks that\noffered off-balance-sheet commitments to their structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, have\nfound themselves having to move these assets onto their balance sheets. All this asset onboarding has pressured capital ratios. Combine these pressures with the difficulty of establishing\nvalues for structured credit products in seized-up markets and it is no surprise that term interbank\nlending thinned out considerably.\nThat’s what happened. There will be lots of theories as to how it happened. Mine is fairly\nstraightforward: however many “quants” from MIT or Cal Tech or UT San Antonio you bring in\nto build models that theorize away risk, there is no overturning the fundamental law that the\nprice of an asset is determined by what someone is willing to pay for it. Mathematical models\ncomplement judgment and experience but are no substitute for them. Judgment and experience,\nincluding our own vivid experience here in Texas in the 1980s, teach us that in booms and\nbubbles, prices overshoot and during busts, they overcorrect.\nTo a great extent, the bubble in housing was a classic case of the bigger-fool theory and efficientmarket theory run amok. The excesses in subprime lending in the United States were fed by an\nexcessive amount of faith in technically sophisticated approaches to risk management and a\n5\n\n\fmisguided belief that mathematical models could price securitized assets, including securities\nbased on mortgages, accurately. These valuation methodologies were so technical and\nmathematically sophisticated that their utter complexity lulled many people into a false sense of\nsecurity. In the end, complexity proved hopelessly inadequate as an all-encompassing measure of\nrisk, despite its frequent advertisement as such. The risk models employed turned out to be\nmerely formulaic descriptions of the past and created an illusion of precision. Such approaches\ncould not and cannot replace the forward-looking judgment of a seasoned professional.\nSeasoned investors and creditors know that incomplete information—or information asymmetry,\nin technical jargon—is a fact of life in financial markets. In fact, the presence of information\nasymmetries goes a long way toward explaining the structure of financial markets and\ninstitutions. In our system, we have implemented a process of “delegated monitoring” to address\nthese asymmetries.\nLet me explain what I mean by “delegated monitoring.” Because an individual saver would be\nhard-pressed to monitor the many potential borrowers to whom they could lend, they have\ndelegated that monitoring role to their bank, which then is in charge of keeping tabs on\nborrowers. In the U.S., where the safety of deposits at most banks is federally guaranteed,\nregulators are a delegated monitor, loosely speaking, watching over banks on behalf of their\ncollective depositors.\nThe regulators also are not above delegating some work. Rather than attempting to monitor the\nentire universe of financial institutions, U.S. regulators rely heavily on a core group of very large\nmoney center banks with significant exposures, expecting them to act as delegated monitors,\ndisciplining the remaining players in the financial system through effective controls on\ncounterparty risk by assessing and limiting the risk of other banks, hedge funds and private\nequity firms. And finally, regulators and investors alike have come to depend on ratings agencies\nto assess and monitor firms and securities on their behalf.\nAll these complex monitoring arrangements are motivated, at least in part, by the fact that\ninformation is costly. Yet it seems to me that a lot of our recent problems can be attributed to\nbreakdowns in this chain of delegated monitoring. To this end, the secretary of the Treasury has\nput forward recommendations to modernize and clarify the chain of command of delegated\nmonitoring. We are studying the recommendations he has made—as is the Congress and\nothers—and will contemplate them dispassionately over time.\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve is doing its level best to facilitate the process of price discovery\nand adjustment from a period of excess in a manner that restores the efficacy of the financial\nsystem.\nHere is a simple analogy to help you think about our effort. The Federal Reserve is charged with\nconducting monetary policy that sustains noninflationary economic growth. We have at our\ndisposal a tool called the federal funds rate, which we set as the base lending rate for the\neconomy. Think of the fed funds rate as a monetary spigot, and the Fed’s goal is keeping the\nlawn of the economy green and healthy. If we turn the spigot up too forcefully, we will flood and\nkill the grass with inflation. If we provide too little, the lawn turns brown, starved for money. To\nget the money from the spigot to the lawn requires a working system of pipes and sprinkler\nheads. The “shadow banking system,” however, looks like a Rube Goldberg device designed by\n6\n\n\fa hydrologist on acid, with pipes and conduits that lead every which way and not always toward\nthe goal of sustainable economic growth. Moreover, the system of pipes and outlets is clogged\nwith the muck and residue of a prolonged and frenetic period of unrestrained growth and abuse.\nUntil the confusion and the debris are cleared away, financial intermediaries will be reluctant to\nbook new loans or incur additional risk. This retards the impact of additional monetary\naccommodation.\nThus, even as we have been cutting the fed funds rate—even as we have been opening the\nmonetary spigot—interest rates for private sector borrowers have not fallen correspondingly, and\nrates for some borrowers have increased. The grass is turning brown.\nTo address this problem, we have created some new facilities that should provide a liquidity\nbridge over the currently dysfunctional system while the marketplace and regulators—ourselves\nincluded—go about restoring the system’s plumbing.\nThe term auction facility—known by its acronym, TAF—was introduced in December as an\nentirely new approach to funding problems at banks. Those who are eligible for primary credit at\nthe Fed’s traditional discount window can now bid at bimonthly auctions for term funds. So far,\nthe auctions have been well-subscribed and term funding pressures abated after the introduction\nof the TAF. The term securities lending facility we announced last month expands the Fed’s\nsecurities lending program. Securities will now be made available through an auction process\nwith an expanded array of collateral on a weekly basis for a term of 28 days. We also set up a\nprimary dealer credit facility, an overnight lending facility that provides funding to primary\ndealers in exchange for a range of eligible collateral. And, at the request of the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York, the Board of Governors of the Fed approved a loan to J. P. Morgan so that\nthat bank might digest the exposure that many counterparties had to Bear Stearns, without\nrewarding Bear Stearns shareholders for the imprudent risks assumed by their management.\nTo repeat, the objective of all this activity is to provide a bridge for the financial system while it\ntransitions from a period of indiscriminate excess and gets back to normalcy. I do not believe the\nFed should be, or is, “bailing out” any particular institution. Nor do I personally believe that any\ninstitution in and of itself is “too big to fail.” But I do believe that we must have a financial\nsystem that is in working order. We must have a system where the chain of delegated monitors\noperates smoothly and efficiently. We must have a system where the pipes that nourish\ncapitalism sustain the fertile lawn that is the American economy. It is the Fed’s duty as lender of\nlast resort to lead the way to restoring the efficacy of the financial system.\nThe Fed has made some tough judgment calls lately, and, having been party to making those\ncalls, I can assure you they certainly were not made lightly. In principle, we know that the\nmarket should decide the winners and losers, who survives and who fails. I am a big fan of\nWinston Churchill. “It is always more easy to discover and proclaim general principles than to\napply them,” Churchill said. I now know full well what he meant.\nLooking to the future, and in summary, the emerging discussion on new regulations and a new\nsupervisory framework should proceed, but regulations by themselves cannot replace good\njudgment by individual investors or bankers or financiers, and certainly by policymakers.\nPolicymakers need to remain vigilant in seeking the right balance between prudent and\nindiscriminate risk taking. But the elimination of risk—and the consequences of incurring risk—\n7\n\n\fcan never be the goal of any policymaker in a capitalist system. In building the bridge to restore\nfinancial order and efficiency, my primary interest is to do the minimum necessary to get the job\ndone. And no more. In so doing, my hope is that we restore the long-term faith of the millions of\nrisk takers who make our economy so mighty.\nHaving used the term “mighty,” let me turn to Texas. Texas’ housing, as mentioned earlier, is\naffordable. Our industrial mix creates jobs that are appealing. People continue to move here from\nthe high-priced East and West Coasts and the Midwest, where the job market has been softer. We\nare a thriving engine of growth in an otherwise anemic economy.\nHere are some data to prove the point. Between 2004 and 2007, job growth in the expensive\ncities on the East and West Coasts was 4 percent or less. In manufacturing-oriented cities of the\nMidwest, the job market was weaker, with Cleveland and Detroit posting declines. By contrast,\nbetween 2004 and 2007 employment in Dallas grew by 8.9 percent. In Houston, by over 12\npercent! Last year, almost one-third of all the private sector jobs created across America were\ncreated in our state. Let me repeat that: Over 30 percent of all the private sector jobs created in\nAmerica last year were created right here in the Lone Star State.\nAs a Texan speaking to a room full of Texans, I would be remiss if I didn’t offer my two cents\nabout what this state ought to be doing in times like these. Before he became president, Jack\nKennedy reminded an audience that the Chinese character for the word “crisis” has two brush\nstrokes. One stroke means danger, the other means opportunity. As Kennedy so wisely put it, “In\na crisis, be aware of the danger but recognize the opportunity.”\nThe housing crisis may not yet have run its course, and further danger could lie ahead both for\nthe nation and also for Texas. We may seem isolated from the rest of the nation’s woes, but we\nare not immune from the dangers they pose. Still, as I survey the Texan economic landscape, I\nsense we have an opportunity here. Our economy is growing. We’re an affordable and wonderful\nplace to live. And we hunger for workers—as recently as this morning I heard anecdotal reports\nof labor shortages in parts of Texas.\nThe U.S. economy will continue to suffer from a bout of anemia while the housing and financial\nmarkets settle down. I take comfort, however, in knowing that markets eventually clear if we at\nthe Fed do our job and the other regulators and fiscal authorities do theirs. Even in the egocentric\npresent, when gloomy analysts lament “unprecedented problems,” we must never lose faith in\nthe economic machine that has propelled the U.S. economy to unprecedented prosperity. You\nneed look no further than to what is happening in our own state for proof of our nation’s inherent\nresiliency. All I ask of you as San Antonians and as Texans is that you continue to serve as the\nexemplar of what can be accomplished by properly managing risk and turning “unprecedented\nproblems” into unrivaled opportunities, as Americans have done time and time again.\nThank you.\n\n8\n\n\f"

        "content": "Comments on Stylized Facts\nof Globalization and World Inflation\nRemarks for a panel discussion at the International Symposium\nof the Banque de France on Globalisation, Inflation and Monetary Policy\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nParis, France\nMarch 7, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fComments on Stylized Facts of Globalization and World Inflation\nRichard W. Fisher\nFirst, I’d like to thank Governor [Christian] Noyer for the invitation to participate in this\nconference. The topic could not be more timely, and it is one that is close to my heart. It is a\ngreat privilege to discuss this paper by Ken Rogoff.\nWhen I took office as president of the Dallas Fed three years ago, I made it clear that I wanted\nour signature research issue for the coming years to be the study of the implications of\nglobalization for the conduct of monetary policy in the U.S. To this end, we have created a\nGlobalization and Monetary Policy Institute and have assembled a blue-ribbon advisory board\nthat includes Ken Rogoff among its members.\nLet me start by posing a rhetorical question. Should the default framework for thinking about\nmonetary policy in a country like the U.S. or, indeed, in the euro area, be an open economy\nwhere capital flows across national borders, goods and services are sourced from the cheapest\nglobal suppliers, interest rate movements in one country impact rates in another, and exchange\nrates factor in firms’ pricing and production decisions? Or can we get by thinking in closedeconomy terms, where domestic investment is financed with domestic savings, we only consume\nwhat we produce, interest rates are determined at home and exchange rates are irrelevant?\nNobody who has lived on the planet since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ascendancy of Deng\nXiaoping would likely testify to the validity of the second proposition. Globalization means that\nwe can no longer guide policy by ignoring trade and capital flows or the invisible but nonetheless\neffective links between countries that have been forged through cyberspace. Yet it appears to me\nthat the default framework for thinking about monetary policy continues to be the closedeconomy model.\nNow on to Professor Rogoff’s paper. Ken’s paper starts with a review of some of the salient facts\nabout globalization and segues to a discussion about the seeming resilience of the globalized\nworld economy and the important role that better monetary policy plays in ensuring that\nresilience. He then proceeds with a discussion of the central role China seems to be playing in\nthe recent acceleration of globalization, assesses its impact on global commodity prices and then\nwraps up with a very nice discussion of whether the recent subprime crisis is all that different\nfrom previous banking crises.\nGlobalization means different things to different people. To the Chinese peasant it may mean the\nprospect of an end to poverty and steady improvement in his living standards. To the American\nor French factory worker it may mean the threat of cheap imports and the potential outsourcing\nof his or her job. To the environmental activist it may mean the despoliation of the earth’s\natmosphere as more countries industrialize and pour pollutants into the atmosphere. To the\npublic intellectual it may mean the loss of national identity and the Americanization of culture.\nThere are many important dimensions to globalization, but as a central banker, I am most\ninterested in the economic dimensions, namely the greater integration of national economies\nthrough increased trade of goods and services, investment, migration, and task allocation. All of\nthese facilitate the dissemination of ideas and technologies that are another key manifestation of\nglobalization and indeed contribute to its spread.\n1\n\n\fHowever, it is extraordinarily difficult to get a good handle on just how rapidly the world is\nglobalizing. As Ken notes, there is a lot of hype out there about how many new workers and\nconsumers have become part of the global economy as a result of the demise of communism and\nthe opening of China, India and other economies. The raw numbers in terms of population are\nhuge—we are talking billions with a “b”—but the true extent to which the workers in these\ncountries are, for want of a better word, substitutable for workers in advanced economies is an\nopen question. It is this substitutability that determines how the coming on line of this new labor\nforce will impact the wages of workers in the advanced economies. It would appear that the\nnumber of workers in countries like China and India who possess skills comparable to those\nfound among the workforces of the U.S., Europe and other advanced nations is a small subset of\nthe headline numbers.\nIt is worth reminding the audience that the nominal per capita income of the average Chinese\ncitizen today is, in inflation-adjusted terms, roughly equivalent to that of an American worker in\nthe early 1900s. And yet, for those workers who possess the skills demanded by a modern\neconomy, wages have rapidly approached advanced-economy levels. There are abundant\nanecdotal reports that the salaries of top programmers in Mumbai are quickly converging to\nthose of their peers in Silicon Valley. Likewise, there is rapid wage growth for managers in\nChina who can work in Western companies. Indeed, just last week the Financial Times reported\non million-dollar bonuses paid to certain Chinese executives in the financial sector. But the vast\nmajority of the new workers in the global economy at present bring little more than their raw\nlabor and thirst for betterment.\nTechnological improvements and policy changes have both been important drivers of\nglobalization. The information technology revolution has played an important role in breaking\ndown the barrier between those goods and services that were hitherto thought to be tradable\nacross national borders and those that were not. Services that were long considered to be the\nquintessential nontradable good are increasingly traded internationally. If you do the numbers,\nyou will find that the U.S. exports a lot more services than it imports, and moving up the valueadded chain into more service-oriented sectors is key to the continued competitiveness of the\nU.S. economy.\nBy some measures, financial globalization has proceeded even more rapidly than the “real”\nglobalization that is rooted in trade flows. In some sense, this is not too surprising. While\ninnovations in transportation technology—such as the inventions of container shipping and the\njumbo jet that Ken mentions in his presentation—have helped reduce the effective geographic\ndistance between countries, making it easier to trade goods, distance in a very fundamental sense\nstill matters for trade. However, the information technology revolution has effectively eliminated\nthe idea of geographic distance in financial and several other service transactions. Financial\ntrades can be executed at any time of the day in any part of the world at the click of a mouse.\nArchitectural renderings can be created thousands of miles from the firm that commissions them.\nX-rays and CAT scans of patients in Dallas or Paris can be analyzed in Sydney or Delhi while\ntheir Texan or French doctors sleep. As long as the earth rotates on its axis and satellite and\nInternet connections are maintained, technology never sleeps in a globalized world, nor does the\nproduction of other goods and services.\n\n2\n\n\fGlobalization is not new. Some of the key technical innovations that make today’s globalization\npossible are a half century old or older. But it is perhaps worth emphasizing that much of the\nglobalization that occurred in the immediate post-World War II period was simply getting us\nback to where we were on the eve of World War I. As is well known, by the early 1970s, trade\nflows had gotten back to where they were in 1913, but other key dimensions of globalization,\ncapital flows and migration, were still well below their pre-World War I levels. Indeed, the\nreversal of globalization in the interwar period is something we should never forget and serves as\na reminder that we cannot take a liberal international economic order for granted.\nWriting shortly after the end of World War I, John Maynard Keynes commented on how\nthoroughly “internationalized” (his expression) the world was in 1913. It is worth repeating what\nhe said: “The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the\nvarious products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect\ntheir early delivery upon his door-step; …[and] at the same moment and by the same means\nadventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and\nshare, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he could\ndecide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any\nsubstantial municipality in any continent that fancy or information might recommend. He could\nsecure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or\nclimate without passport or other formality, could dispatch his servant to the neighboring office\nof a bank for such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and could then\nproceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs,\nbearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly aggrieved and much\nsurprised at the least interference.” Most important of all, this average inhabitant of London\n“…regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of\nfurther improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.”\nThat rather bucolic description of globalization as it once was practiced was penned by Keynes\nin The Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919. It seems unlikely that the unique set of\ncircumstances that led to the collapse of globalization between the great wars of the twentieth\ncentury will ever be repeated, but newer twenty-first century challenges could just as easily\nimpede the progress of globalization.\nTaking a very long-term perspective on globalization, looking at it from the perspective of\ncenturies and not just decades, also teaches us something about the role of the monetary standard\nin promoting international economic integration. The nominal stability associated with the gold\nstandard played an important role in fostering globalization in the nineteenth century. The\ntransition to a fiat standard created some challenges for central bankers, but in recent years\ncentral bankers have come to a better understanding of how they need to conduct monetary\npolicy under a fiat standard and have done a good job at delivering price stability. Ken is right:\nHigh inflation is much rarer now, with only two countries experiencing what might be\nconsidered very high or hyperinflations. This greater nominal stability is a key factor underlying\nthe surge of globalization over the past decade and a half and remains vital to continued\nprogress.\nBut how resilient are the new monetary frameworks? Is the adoption of formal or informal\ninflation targeting the key to central bank successes in recent years, or have they been the\nbeneficiaries of a dollop of good luck in the form of higher productivity growth? Better monetary\n3\n\n\fpolicy helped make greater globalization and faster productivity growth possible, but\nglobalization and faster productivity growth also made the jobs of central bankers easier. The\nmore challenging circumstances that have developed over the recent past—as the tailwinds that\nensued from the addition of new workers to the production side of global output have morphed\ninto headwinds of demand for scarce resources—will serve to stress-test the new monetary\npolicy frameworks in ways they have not been tested before.\nNo discussion of globalization would be complete without some mention of China’s\nextraordinary growth over the past decade. The raw numbers are staggering, from the rapid\nurbanization of its population to the extraordinary increases in output year after year and the\nvoracious demand for raw materials as it becomes the workshop of the world. Ken asks what\nwould happen to the favorable inflation and productivity environment if internal stresses in\nChinese society were to cause the authorities to slow down or even reverse some of the recent\nmarket reforms. There can be little doubt that the Chinese authorities face a gargantuan task in\nmanaging the transition of the economy to a free-market system. Recent strains have manifested\nthemselves in higher inflation, and the ability of the authorities to control that inflation is clearly\nhindered by the exchange-rate regime. Greater exchange-rate flexibility will enhance the ability\nof the People’s Bank of China to deliver price stability, the surest contribution any central bank\ncan make to improvements in living standards over the long term.\nGlobalization does matter for inflation, but not in the ways that are often suggested in the media.\nThe most common fallacy is, of course, the confusion of relative price with price level changes,\nthe idea that a flood of cheap imports from China must of necessity lower the price level and the\ninflation rate. The channels whereby globalization affects inflation are much more subtle and not\nalways necessarily benign. Furthermore, I believe that different dimensions of globalization\naffect the dynamics of inflation in fundamentally different ways.\nLet’s start with trade. The availability of cheap imports from China and other countries does\nhave a direct and indirect impact on domestic prices and inflation. There has been a significant\namount of work in recent years trying to document the size of this effect. The estimates vary, but\nthey are generally significant. But the mechanism whereby the price changes are realized is\nsubtle. Yes, there is a direct effect through the availability of cheaper imports. When those\ncheaper imports are inputs into the production process, we know they directly lower prices at\nhome. The price effect is not just relative, but absolute. But that will be offset to some extent as\nconsumers use their enhanced purchasing power to buy more of other products, putting upward\npressure on prices. The threat of competition also has an effect on the pricing decisions of\ndomestic firms, both for firms producing products that are close substitutes for the imported\ngoods and for firms that use those imports as inputs. Cheaper imports will also have an impact on\nthe wage demands of workers who consume those goods. Of course, the effect is not all in one\ndirection, as Ken notes in his paper. The downside of the rapid growth in production in low-wage\ncountries is the upward pressure that this growth has put on commodity prices worldwide. Faster\ngrowth in incomes is having a significant effect on global food prices, although some of the\nrecent increases have been driven by policy changes encouraging the production of biofuels and\nsupply-side developments as well.\nThe thirst of the emerging-market economies for raw materials and the relative inefficiency with\nwhich they use these raw materials has propelled industrial commodity prices to record levels.\nThe fact that these increases have been persistent and not quickly reversed has raised tough\n4\n\n\fquestions about traditional measures of core inflation and made it increasingly difficult for\ncentral bankers to separate signal from noise in the inflation data. We in Dallas look at not just\nthe traditional measure of core inflation that simply excludes food and energy prices, but also a\ntrimmed mean measure that we think gives a better sense of where trends may be headed. While\nan improvement on the traditional measure, it too has some shortcomings, and I believe that over\nthe long term, the price stability that matters most to the people who pay our salaries, since they\ndo eat and they do drive, is stability of a comprehensive measure of prices.\nGlobalization of labor markets also matters for inflation dynamics. Now, one of the key\ndifferences between the current era of globalization and the one that preceded WWI has to do\nwith the greater restrictions on international movement of labor. We don’t see the same mass\nmovements of people as characterized the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and with\nmore countries providing social safety nets, and the equivalent of “virtual immigration” through\ncyberspace, we are unlikely to see such mass migrations ever again. Nevertheless, for some\ncountries, recent movements of workers have been quantitatively large enough to affect prices.\nThe recent expansion of the European Union and the freeing of labor mobility has clearly made a\ndifference to wage and price dynamics in Europe. Whether this is a one-off effect associated with\na permanent reallocation of labor from low-wage to high-wage countries or a longer-term\ndevelopment whereby workers are more willing to move in search of job opportunities in\nresponse to the business cycle, it is too early to say.\nThe third key dimension of globalization—that of capital markets—also matters for inflation, but\nin a way that fundamentally differs from trade flows and migration. Greater international capital\nmobility seems to have a disciplining effect on policymakers worldwide by making it costly to\nengage in reckless fiscal or monetary policies. But again, I think there is two-way causation.\nSounder monetary policy in more countries has contributed to the willingness of investors to\nventure abroad, but the ease with which capital can take flight has also made it more costly for\ncentral banks to deviate from the new orthodoxy of price stability.\nThe fourth dimension is the least understood. That is the global assignment of tasks through\nnontraditional channels. The U.S. is a high-value-added, services-driven economy; services\nrepresent over 80 percent of our economy. The growth of service sector trade, particularly\nthrough fiber optic cable and satellite connections, poses significant measurement issues. It is not\nas if we can just go down to the docks and count containers coming and going to quantify the\nimpact of service sector trade. And what implication does the increasing trade in tasks with\ncheap labor pools around the globe pose for pricing of services and, in turn, for inflation?\nKen’s final point has to do with the skepticism of some academics about the implications of\nglobalization for monetary policy. He cites a recent important paper by Michael Woodford as a\nrepresentative example, so let me conclude with two observations related to that paper. First, I\nthink there is an element of talking at cross purposes in some of the exchanges that have taken\nplace on what globalization may or may not mean for monetary policy. I am in substantive\nagreement with Woodford that globalization does not undermine the ability of the Fed, or any\nother central bank for that matter, to control inflation over an appropriate time horizon, but it\ndoes challenge us—you might say it disciplines us—to conduct monetary policy more prudently.\nIn today’s world, where investors can move their funds instantly from one currency to another to\navoid depreciation, the price central bankers pay for high inflation is much higher than in the\npast. Understanding this, you can see why I am a steadfast inflation-fighting owl.\n5\n\n\fGlobalization also should make us change the way we interpret some of the indicators that have\ntraditionally played such an important role in monetary policy deliberations. Globalization\nindeed warrants the examination of a broader array of data in arriving at monetary policy\ndecisions. For example, understanding global capacity utilization in an industry may be more\nuseful than equivalent measures of domestic capacity. Second, the elegance of Woodford’s\nexposition notwithstanding, we are still some way from having a consensus model of how the\ndomestic and international economy works. Enormous progress has been made in recent decades,\ndue in no small part to the work of scholars like Ken Rogoff and Michael Woodford, but a lot\nmore remains to be done, and we are spending an enormous amount of time doing it at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas. At times of rapid structural change, it is important to keep an\nopen mind and challenge old assumptions and paradigms, within a framework of disciplined,\nevidence-based scientific inquiry.\n\n6\n\n\f"

        "content": "Balancing Inflation and Growth\nRemarks before the Society of Business Economists\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nLondon, England\nMarch 4, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fBalancing Inflation and Growth\nRichard W. Fisher\nIt is an honor to speak here in London to the Society of Business Economists at the suggestion of\nmy much-admired friend, Charlie Bean at the Bank of England. Charlie is on the advisory board\nof the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, and we are most grateful for his\ninsight and, not unimportantly, his wit.\nI am on my way to a conference in Paris, where I have been invited by the Banque de France to\ncomment on a paper by another of our institute’s esteemed advisors, Harvard professor Ken\nRogoff. I hope my French hosts will forgive me for bringing up my favorite of all of\nShakespeare’s histories this evening, Henry V, as I recall one of the more pleasant moments\nduring my tenure on the Federal Open Market Committee. During our last meeting with Alan\nGreenspan as chairman, some of us took advantage of the moment to ham it up and work a\nfarewell salute into our otherwise somber interventions. I chose to adapt Henry’s speech to the\ntroops at Agincourt. Affecting my best Kenneth Branagh imitation, I mangled the words of the\nBard: “We few, we happy few, we band of bankers,” and so on, concluding with the observation\nthat “…other economists now abed”—it was morning when we met—“shall think themselves\naccursed they were not here, and hold their policy prescriptions cheap while any speaks that\nserved in Alan Greenspan’s days.” When I finished, Alan looked down the table and said,\n“President Fisher, was that Henry V?” “Yes, Mr. Chairman,” I replied. “I know I’ve reached\nretirement age,” said the ancient chairman. “I went to high school with that guy.”\nWould that we could today enjoy such levity from the days when SIVs, CDOs, ARS and SLARS\nand VRDOs—or the “R” or the “S” words, as in “recession” and “stagflation”—were not yet part\nof the polite lexicon of monetary circles. These are not the happiest of times. These are, to put it\neuphemistically, challenging times for central bankers. We are confronted with the twin evils of\nslower growth and higher inflation, while also having to fight a banging hangover that resulted\nfrom allowing financial intermediaries to party on too hard for too long.\nThe monetary policy and regulatory frameworks that appeared to serve us so well in past decades\nare being stress-tested in ways that few dared imagine during that bucolic period when many\nwere lulled into assuming things would be forever NICE, as Mervyn King so memorably put it. 1\nWe know now that a Non-Inflationary Consistent Expansion is not the steady state of nature.\nNeither is the Great Moderation of both the economy and financial market volatility.\nIndeed, as I speak, central bankers here and across both the pond and the channel feel besieged\nby a seemingly insurmountable foe delivering retribution for our having been complacent, if not\nsmug, during those happier days. Like Henry’s troops at Agincourt, it may appear that we face\noverwhelming odds. Yet I am not overwhelmed.\nWhy not, you ask? Allow me to invoke another of your English ancestors in reply. Winston\nChurchill once asked: “Why is it that the ship beats the waves, when they are so many and the\n\n1 Mervyn King, Speech to East Midlands Development Agency/Bank of England Dinner in Leicester, Oct. 14, 2003.\n\n1\n\n\fship is one? The reason is that the ship has a purpose.” Tonight, I wish to give my view of the\npurpose of the Federal Reserve.\nNeedless to say—but I will say so anyway—the views I express this evening will be my own and\nnot those of any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee or any official of the\nFederal Reserve System. This is but one man’s soliloquy.\nThe Federal Reserve, unlike the Bank of England, has a dual mandate. We are charged with\ncreating the monetary conditions to support sustainable noninflationary employment growth. We\nmust keep our eyes on two things: economic growth and price pressures. Of course, this is easier\nsaid than done. It poses a conundrum of priority and balance. How should we weigh the risks of\nslow growth over the need to manage inflation? Reasonable men and women can agree that\ninflation is a sinister beast that, if untethered, will devour savings, erode the purchasing power of\nconsumers, decimate returns on capital, undermine the reliability of financial accounting, distract\nthe attention of corporate management and undercut employment growth and real wages.\nThoughtful men and women can also agree that at certain junctures, sluggish employment\ngrowth and financial instability present greater risks than inflation to the economic welfare of the\nnation. Both feverish price pressures and economic anemia matter, and both present great risk to\nour welfare. Both deserve our attention. But the question of the day is which deserves more of\nour attention right now.\nSome argue it is the slowing economy. Even if you foresee the most likely U.S. scenario as a\nperiod of flat growth for a few quarters, followed later in the year by a return to potential growth\nof about 3 percent, one cannot help but worry about whether the so-called tail risk—the odds of\nthe worst-case scenario on the growth distribution curve unfolding—is getting fatter as the\ninventory of unsold homes continues to swell, consumers’ sense of wealth and businesses’\nconfidence erodes, and the solicitous bankers that used to court them become more coy.\nYet, the worst-case scenario remains very much a “tail” risk. As Chairman Bernanke noted in\ntestimony before Congress last week, the nonfinancial sector has held up reasonably well and\ncontinues to expand. Employment growth is weakening and consumer confidence is sagging, but\ninventories and other indicators remain constructive. You can see evidence of this in the fourth\nquarter’s corporate performance. Thomson Financial reported last week that earnings were on\ntrack to be down 22 percent for the 462 S&P 500 companies that have so far released their\nnumbers for the quarter. But strip out the financial institutions, and earnings were up 12 percent,\nand 62 percent of those 462 companies reported earnings that topped analysts’ expectations. In\nall, that is not bad when you consider the beating the financials have taken and how stocks of\nhousing and housing-related companies have been pummeled.\nThe woes of financial operators should not be overlooked, of course. There is a palpable risk that\ntheir pathology will lead to credit constriction that will, in turn, trigger an economic contraction.\nBut thus far, the Cassandras on Wall Street, in the press and on the political campaign trails have\nhad less to be glum about than they expected—or perhaps they had hoped for.\nThis is not to say that we are not at risk of encountering turbulence. Personally, I think the\ncruising speed of the U.S. economy has slowed considerably, and it is likely to remain subpar for\nthe current and following quarter. Without getting into specific numbers, I will tell you that my\ngrowth forecast is one of the more bearish among FOMC members. For someone like me, who\n2\n\n\fhas served on corporate boards and run a private company, it is not difficult to imagine managers\nbeing cautioned by their directors and consultants to batten down their hatches and run ever\ntighter ships at a time of gloomy news stories, dire predictions by respectable analysts and\nalarming rhetoric from public officials. While there is a risk the U.S. economy might sputter, I do\nnot believe that mighty engine will stall. I have tremendous faith in the ability of the women and\nmen who operate the private sector to overcome obstacles placed before them and keep the\npistons of the economy pumping. You can lose a lot of money betting against the recuperative\npower of the American economy.\nAt the same time, I am fully aware that the FOMC must be careful to not undermine that\nrecuperative process. Here, of course, I refer to the potential harm to the consumer and the\nbusiness and financial sectors alike by unwittingly allowing the perception to take hold that, as\nthe New York Times editorialized in its lead front page article last Thursday, “the Federal\nReserve, signaled [its] readiness … to bolster the economy with cheaper money even though\ninflation is picking up speed.” 2\nTalk of “cheap money” makes my skin crawl. The words imply a debased currency and inflation\nand the harsh medicine that inevitably must be administered to purge it. So you should not be\nsurprised that I consider the perception that the Fed is pursuing a cheap-money strategy, should it\ntake root, to be a paramount risk to the long-term welfare of the U.S. economy.\nI believe the Times overstates its case. Chairman Bernanke made clear in his congressional\ntestimony last week that we are monitoring inflationary pressures and expectations closely. And\nyet, I understand the source of the Times’ sentiment. In a globalized capital market where money\nis free to move anywhere it pleases, there is scant tolerance for even the slightest whiff of\ninflation. Since the January FOMC meeting, longer-term rates, including those on fixed\nmortgages, have risen rather than followed the federal funds rate downward. Over the same\nperiod, the dollar has declined nearly 3 percent against the euro. We know that monetary policy\nacts with a lag, but even with my well-documented pessimism about the efficacy of lowering the\nfed funds rate to 3 percent, I had privately hoped, against the odds, that we might get a\npsychological pop out of the yield curve. Instead, we have heard more and more reports of\ninflationary concerns, and with them increases in longer-term rates and record low exchange\nrates for the dollar.\nMind you, all these signals could be aberrations—twitches in markets that have occasionally led\nme to wonder if they were afflicted with the financial equivalent of Tourette’s syndrome. But\nthey might also indicate that the markets are unnerved by the idea of further monetary\naccommodation in a world where commodity prices inch upward almost on a daily basis and\nlabor costs escalate in Chinese factories, among Indian programmers and all along global supply\nchains.\nI am going to dwell on inflation for a few minutes because I consider it a critical issue. I spoke\nearlier of Churchill’s ship of purpose. As my FOMC colleague Governor Rick Mishkin argues so\neloquently, it is essential that monetary policy firmly anchor inflation expectations. If the Federal\nReserve has an overarching purpose, in my opinion, it is to make sure that anchor stays firmly in\nplace.\n2\n\n“Bernanke Says Sagging Growth Is Chief Concern,” New York Times, Feb. 28, 2008, Edmund L. Andrews, A1.\n3\n\n\fRecent readings on inflation have not been encouraging. The rate of increase in the core personal\nconsumption expenditures price index, or core PCE—that is, what people buy, except food and\nenergy—was 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in January. Yet, its headline counterpart,\nwhich includes food and energy, increased an alarming 3.7 percent over the same time frame.\nBoth core and headline PCE figures have been following an accelerating trajectory over the past\nseveral months. If you annualize the change in the PCE over the most recent three-month period,\nfor example, you’ll notice that the core rose 3 percent, while headline rose 5.4 percent.\nClearly, food and energy prices matter, as these differences make clear. The price index for food\nrose 4.7 percent over the past 12 months, a rate not seen since 1990. Through January, the PCE\nenergy component was up roughly 23 percent over 12 months.\nWhile some of the movement in core consumer price inflation represents pass-through of high\nenergy prices—to transportation services, for example—we have also seen pickups in other\ncomponents, such as recreation, education and personal care services, and upticks in\ncomponents, such as apparel, that have historically exerted downward pressure on the price of\nthe consumer’s basket of goods.\nThere was a time, back when I was an outside observer of the Federal Reserve, when the Fed\npracticed what some have dubbed “opportunistic disinflation.” Beginning in the mid-1980s, the\nFOMC recognized that while recessions sometimes occur, they could not be anticipated with any\nprecision and that by the time the data revealed a recession, it was too late to do much about it,\ngiven the impact lags of monetary policy. The FOMC also recognized that the trend rate of\ninflation generally fell by about a percentage point or more following a recession. Put it all\ntogether and you get opportunistic disinflation, or the idea that if recession comes, make the best\nof it by bringing down the inflation rate.\nThis was a period of persistent disinflation—and, I might add, a period during which the U.S.\neconomy experienced only two short and mild recessions, a total of 16 months over almost 25\nyears. Over this same period, the inflation rate declined inexorably, reaching a point where the\nFOMC had to deal with the threat of deflation in 2003–04. It was also the period when the Fed\nmade the largest gains in its policy credibility.\nOne would like to think that as the economy slows, inflationary pressures will do likewise. But\nwe cannot always be sure they will, given the globalized nature of the U.S. economy. Demandpull pressures abroad have an increasingly potent influence on our domestic economy.\nTraditionally, a central bank would expect slack to develop as the economy under its jurisdiction\nweakened, leading to less demand for most inputs and an easing of price pressures. We no longer\noperate in a traditional economy. Domestic inflation developments have become increasingly\nless sensitive to domestic measures of slack. In an open, globalized economy, capacity utilization\nand inflation pressures need to be measured, or at a minimum, understood in their global context.\nYou cannot think in a purely domestic context about the pricing of oil or steel or soybeans or\npulp or shoes or clothing or even what I consider to be one of life’s essentials, beer, because\ninnovations in transportation and communications technology have all but eliminated national\nborders for almost any product for which trade barriers were negotiated away during the 1980s\nand ’90s. More vexing for economists and econometric modelers, the information technology\n4\n\n\frevolution and the spread of the Internet have blurred the once-clear distinction between easy-totrade goods and difficult-to-trade services. As a result, trade in services is one of the most rapidly\ngrowing components of global trade. Thus, even the available supply of architects or petroleum\nengineers or software designers or medical technicians or lawyers must increasingly be\nconsidered in the context of global rather than domestic demand.\nThe point is that, at present, we simply do not have the ability to adequately account for the\nimpact globalization has on the gearing of our domestic economy. Absent that capacity, we\ncannot, in my opinion, confidently assume that slower U.S. economic growth will quell U.S.\ninflation and, more important, keep inflationary expectations anchored. Containing inflation is\nthe purpose of the ship I crew for, and if a temporary economic slowdown is what we must\nendure while we achieve that purpose, then it is, in my opinion, a burden we must bear, however\npolitically inconvenient.\nTo some, this may appear a Hobson’s choice. I don’t see it that way. Our obligation is to prevent\ninflation in order to sustain long-term employment growth. I believe that the best way to cut\nthrough the treacherous economic waves that are upon us and keep our ship steaming forward is\nto stick to our purpose.\nThat about says it all for tonight. Let me bring this back to London. Recently, the New York\nTimes ran a delightful article on your search for a motto that captures the essence of Britain. My\nfavorite was Nemo me impune lacessit, which loosely translated—according to my Texas\nLatin—means “Never sit on a thistle.” Tonight I may have taken the risk of sitting on the thistle\nof opprobrium of those of you who wished to hear a more felicitous speech. But Charlie Bean’s\nadvice was to “just tell ’em what you think.” That is what I have done, and I thank you for\nallowing me to do so.\nIn the time that remains this evening, I would be happy to take questions and, in true central\nbanking fashion, do my level best to avoid answering them.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nMexico City, Mexico\nFebruary 7, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fDefending Central Bank Independence\nRichard W. Fisher\nGracias por darme la oportunidad de hablar ante ustedes. Para mi estar aquí es como regresar a\ncasa. Yo crecí en la Ciudad de México y, aunque les pueda resultar difícil de creer por lo\nrudimentario de mi español, cursé la primaria aquí, estudiando inglés como segunda lengua.\nTengo un profundo afecto por México y todo lo mexicano. De hecho, debo decir que aprendí\nacerca del Cura Hidalgo y Benito Juárez antes de conocer a George Washington o Abraham\nLincoln. También conocí las culturas maya, tolteca, y azteca antes de estudiar la historia antigua\nde los griegos y romanos en las escuelas estadounidenses. Guardo con mucho afecto estos\nrecuerdos de mi niñez y llevo a México prendado en mi corazón. Es para mi un gran honor\nhablar en este importante recinto, ante esta audiencia de las mentes jóvenes mas brillantes de este\ngran país.\nEsta tarde voy a hablar acerca de lo importante que es tener un banco central independiente.\nTrataré de hacerles ver que un banco central independiente es un elemento lógico y fundamental\nde una economía en buen estado; protege a un gobierno democrático de sus propios demonios.\nCreo firmemente que uno de los más grandes logros del México reciente ha sido la adopción de\nla enmienda constitucional de 1994 que otorga verdadera independencia al Banco de México.\nAfirmo además, que el liderazgo del Gobernador Ortiz ha sido insuperable…bueno, estoy\nobligado a decirlo porque él me va a invitar a cenar al rato y quiero estar seguro de que nos la\nvamos a pasar bien.\nAl final de esta presentación hablaré de asuntos recientes tales como la última reunión del\nComité Federal de Mercado Abierto (FOMC, por sus siglas en inglés). Eso me servirá para\nilustrar, en tiempo real, los retos y desafíos a los que se tienen que enfrentar los bancos centrales\nen cuestión de la política monetaria, especialmente en tiempos de coyuntura económica como los\nque estamos viviendo.\nEsta tarde, como siempre, hablo desde mi propia perspectiva, como presidente de uno de los\ndoce bancos regionales de la Reserva Federal, como una sola voz de entre las 17 que actualmente\nparticipan en las deliberaciones del Comité de Mercado Abierto. No hablo a nombre de ningún\notro oficial de la Reserva Federal, ni a nombre del comité.\nEntiendo que todos ustedes hablan inglés, por lo tanto voy a dejar de torturarlos con mi español,\ny continuar en inglés. Al final, tendremos una sesión de preguntas y respuestas que podremos\nllevar a cabo en cualquiera de los dos idiomas, o incluso en la lengua de mi amada Texas:\nSpanglish.\nLet me start with a refresher course on economics, so that we are all on the same page.\nThe price of a good or service is determined by supply and demand. Too much demand relative\nto supply leads to an increase in the relative price of that good or service. Too little leads to a\nprice decrease. Money and credit are the means by which aggregate demand is managed in the\neconomy. The central banker’s task is to provide the monetary and credit conditions that achieve\n1\n\n\fthe ideal balance between accommodating economic expansion and engendering inflation or\ndeflation.\nThe ultimate task assigned to central banks is to maximize the welfare of the people by providing\nthe monetary conditions for sustainable, noninflationary economic growth. In the long run,\ngrowth cannot be sustained if markets are undermined by inflation or deflation. The idea that\nstable prices go hand in hand with achieving sustainable economic growth has led more and\nmore central banks around the world to adopt price stability as their exclusive mandate. Mexico\ntook that view one step further by explicitly writing price stability into the constitutional\namendment that granted Banco de México its independence.\nI submit that the likelihood of achieving sustainable economic growth and keeping inflation at\nbay is best enhanced by having central banks that operate with independence from government\nmeddling.\nEconomic theory generally embraces the idea that a nation’s money supply ought not be directly\ncontrolled by its government because such an arrangement would create a perverse incentive\nstructure that would lead to economic disaster. Printing money, or debasing the currency, to pay\noff government debt is an old concept, noticed by the ancient Greeks and famously practiced by\nthe Romans. In 1824, David Ricardo warned that a government entrusted with the power to issue\nmoney would most certainly abuse it. 1 Like all good economists, Ricardo knew the destructive\ndynamic of printing excess money: The result is inflation, the cruelest form of taxation—\nespecially for the poor and for savers—and the greatest obstacle for entrepreneurs and financiers\nseeking to invest and grow their businesses.\nWe have some glaring examples today of the destruction that can be wrought by governments\nwith direct control over monetary policy. Zimbabwe is the most egregious. A year ago, after\nhaving let monetary printing presses run wild to cover up problems created by misgovernment,\nPresident Mugabe famously declared inflation illegal, promising to arrest and punish anyone\nwho raised prices or wages. Of course, that didn’t work. Just last week it was announced that\nZimbabwe’s inflation reached 26,470 percent in November. The economy of Zimbabwe has been\ndestroyed and its people cast further into poverty as their savings disappear.\nThere are some instructive examples of poor monetary governance in our own hemisphere. In the\ninterest of time, I’ll point to just one case: Venezuela.\nOne would think that Venezuela would be enjoying the prosperity that comes from oil priced\nabove $80 a barrel. But Venezuela’s government has taken effective control of the central bank\nand printed trillions of bolivars to finance ambitious social programs. The result has been an\nofficial inflation rate of 22.7 percent. However, the official figure includes a broad basket of\nitems for which the government has declared price controls, so it is more likely that the real\npurchasing power of the bolivar is being cut in half or more each year. The Venezuelan\nconsumer has been decimated.\nTo counter the inflation the government itself has created, Venezuela recently introduced a new\ncurrency, the “bolivar fuerte,” which is basically the old bolivar with three zeros trimmed off.\n1\n\nRicardo, David, 1824. Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank, Murray, London.\n2\n\n\fSome of your economics professors are old enough to remember when Mexico trimmed zeros off\nthe peso during a time of high inflation. I am sure they will agree that getting rid of all those\nzeros made it easier to do everyday transactions, but the idea that inflation can be brought under\ncontrol simply by dividing all prices and the currency by 1,000 is like believing you can keep a\nroom’s temperature constant by dividing the thermometer marker by two every time the heat\nindex doubles. Marketing gimmicks with new paper money do not lower the heat of inflation;\nthey do not make prices stable. The problem is a lack of economic discipline and bad\ngovernment policies that have undermined sustainable economic growth and destroyed\nVenezuela’s prosperity.\nI think you get the picture. Why do we have independent central banks? To provide a barrier\nbetween government and the money supply. Why is this necessary? Because doing the right\nthing for the long-term interests of the people can be very hard to do. Monetary policymakers\noften have to make decisions that can cause economic pain for real people in the short term, or\ndecide not to do things that could help people out of an immediate bad situation, in order to\npreserve the welfare of the people over the long run.\nThe incentives given to elected officials, even in the most praiseworthy democracies, increase\nthe likelihood of harnessing monetary policy to their political needs. A congressman or a senator\nor a president who has all the best intentions and works earnestly for long-term prosperity is still\nsubject to reelection and would quickly find himself voted out of a job if he tried to implement\nsome of the stern policies that an independent central banker is often required to carry through.\nIt is always easier, for example, to float a weakening economy by loosening the moorings of\nmonetary policy rather than cutting taxes or increasing spending. It is easier to allow inflation to\nfinance ambitious social programs or bail out a government from the burden of debt. Forgive me\nfor invoking Greek mythology and the work of Homer, but governments often fall victim to the\nSiren call of monetary accommodation. But with an independent central bank, a government, like\nOdysseus, can tie itself to the mast and commit to the best policy course for the long haul. Aware\nof the perilous fate that awaits those who succumb to the Sirens, a wise government can direct its\ncentral bankers to stuff beeswax in their ears and ignore the seductive calls of powerful interests\nthat demand accommodation to satisfy immediate political needs. Undistracted by political\nmotivation, the central bank can focus exclusively on piloting economic policy on a consistent\ncourse toward sustainable, noninflationary growth.\nAn independent central bank thus occupies a unique place in the pantheon of government\ninstitutions. Properly designed, it will pursue a deliberate and steady course, untainted by the\npassion of the moment and immune to political exigency and influence. Governments bestow\nindependence upon their central banks once they realize that the best approach to monetary\npolicymaking is a clearly defined mandate for price stability and noninflationary economic\ngrowth, applied consistently from administration to administration, year to year, decade to\ndecade, generation to generation.\nTo understand the rewards that come from having an independent central bank able to block out\nthe Siren calls and focus on price stability, the world need only look here to Mexico. Mexico can\nboast today of an inflation rate that by some measures is even lower than that of the U.S. Mexico\nhas managed two presidential transitions without a peso crisis. Mexican financial markets now\nhave the credibility to issue debt in pesos up to 30 years at less than 8 percent, whereas only a\n3\n\n\fdecade ago the longest maturity horizon for Mexican government debt was one year at over 20\npercent. The yield curve for Mexico has been extended, and Mexican businesses and consumers\ncan now borrow in pesos longer term, enabling the development of crucial infrastructure, such as\nhousing stock. Foreigners can now invest in Mexico without fear of significant peso\ndevaluations.\nThis is not the Mexico I grew up in. Today, the Mexican people have greater wherewithal to\nrealize their dreams. Mexican leaders have earned some impressive bragging rights: Two weeks\nago in Davos, as the various leaders assembled there were bemoaning the financial crisis\npresently afflicting global credit markets, Governor Ortiz, looking back to the Tequila Crisis and\nother episodes, exclaimed that “this time, it wasn’t us.”\nMexico would not be in this proud position today had your government not amended the\nconstitution in 1994 to create a fully independent central bank with price stability as its main\ngoal. Banco de México has become a no-nonsense practitioner of inflation targeting, rightfully\nearning the respect of the international investment and monetary policy communities. And here\ncomes the flattering part that I hope will earn me a nice dinner with Governor Ortiz: It is widely\naccepted in central banking circles that under his direction, Banco de México has become one of\nthe most highly regarded central banks in the world.\nIt requires more than just a law bestowing independence upon a central bank for the bank to\nactually be independent. It also requires that it be independent in practice. By definition, for a\ncentral bank to be independent, it must possess the ability to define its policy objectives without\npolitical pressure and it must be free to use its policy instruments without constraints. This is\neasier said than done.\nWe know from our own experience at the Federal Reserve that in times of duress, Congress or\nthe executive branch can interfere with the workings of a central bank with disastrous\nconsequences. In the 1960s, a populist congressman from East Texas named Wright Patman,\nwho was chairman of the House Banking Committee, launched a comprehensive review of the\nFederal Reserve System that exacted an enormous strain on the System’s staff and resources.\nCongressman Patman was convinced that, contrary to David Ricardo, “money need[ed] to be\nback in politics where it was in the 19th century.” 2 He wanted to legislate away the Fed’s\nindependence and turn it into an arm of the executive branch. Patman’s investigation had reached\na point where the 12 Federal Reserve regional banks and the Washington-based Board of\nGovernors could no longer focus on economic analysis or other functions. Complying with\nPatman’s congressional subpoenas was keeping the Fed from doing its job.\nAt the same time, President Lyndon Johnson was escalating the U.S. military presence in\nVietnam and spending a pretty penny to do so; federal defense expenditures rose to over 10\npercent of GDP, more than double the burden of U.S. military spending today. Johnson needed\nto finance that spending and felt that the Federal Reserve could provide funds cheaply by\nkeeping interest rates low. The Federal Reserve had a real dilemma. It could cut a deal with\nPresident Johnson, who, as the most powerful Texan, could call Patman off, but at the price of\n\n2\n\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library. William McChesney Martin Collection. Box 163; Folder: “Martin\nAddresses (5) April 1962 to July 1964.”\n4\n\n\fsurrendering Fed policy independence to Johnson’s desires; or it could continue to endure the\nPatman investigation and risk the Fed’s charter and long-run institutional independence.\nI should note that whether the then-chairman of the Fed, a very talented and honorable man\nnamed William McChesney Martin, and Johnson made a deal is a matter of speculation. Such an\nagreement would not have been documented if it did exist. What is known is that Chairman\nMartin met with Johnson at the White House in May 1964, and soon thereafter the Patman\nhearings unceremoniously ended without any legislation amending the Federal Reserve’s\nstanding. The Fed held interest rates mostly unchanged over the next 19 months—until\nDecember 1965—despite mounting inflation fueled by government spending.\nU.S. government budget deficits continued to grow, reaching their highest relative levels on\nrecord in the 1970s. Sadly, the Fed monetized these deficits for several years during the 1960s\nunder Martin’s chairmanship and in the 1970s under his successors, Chairmen Arthur Burns and\nWilliam Miller. By 1979, inflation had jumped to 14 percent and the prime rate reached 20\npercent.\nThe Federal Reserve managed to regain control of the economy and its own independence under\nthe firm leadership of Paul Volcker. But the cure for high inflation was a dose of harsh medicine.\nA severe recession ensued, followed by years of high unemployment and high interest rates.\nMonetary decisions made for short-term political gain exacted a heavy toll on the American\npeople.\nThe Siren call for monetary accommodation to address political ends is universal and can seduce\nany leader. Whether you live in Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Mexico, the United States or anywhere\nelse, maintaining true central bank independence is required for achieving long-term economic\nprosperity. The Federal Reserve and Banco de México can best preserve our charters and the\nsacred trust of the people by doing what we have been assigned to do: remain focused on making\nmonetary policy that achieves long-term sustainable noninflationary growth. The future\nprosperity of our two countries depends upon it.\nWhich brings us to the present situation.\nUnder Chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve has been left alone to\nconduct monetary policy. We are a truly independent central bank. Policy is set by the Federal\nOpen Market Committee. The 17 current participants in the FOMC deliberations consist of five\ngovernors, including the chairman, who are appointed by the president of the United States and\nconfirmed by the Senate, and 12 presidents of the Fed’s regional Banks, each of whom serves at\nthe pleasure of his or her Bank’s board of directors. All 17 participate in honest and vigorous\ndiscussion of the economy and each offers his or her individual policy prescription at FOMC\nmeetings convened and presided over by the chairman. At the end of these meetings, the\nchairman calls for a vote. All the governors vote every year and five of the presidents vote under\na rotation system so that different presidents vote year by year. This year, I have the privilege of\nbeing one of the five voting presidents.\nAt the last meeting of the FOMC, I voted against lowering the federal funds rate—the target rate\nwe set for banks to loan overnight money to each other—from 3.5 percent to 3 percent. The\n5\n\n\fminutes of that meeting will be released on Feb. 20, 2008. It would be inappropriate for me to\ndiscuss the deliberations; however, I can give you a perspective.\nI spoke earlier of William McChesney Martin. He famously said that the job of a good central\nbanker is to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going. For the past few years, we\nhave had a raucous party of economic growth fueled by an intoxicating brew of credit market\npractices that financed a housing boom of historic, and late in the cycle, hysteric, proportions.\nWith the benefit of perfect hindsight, some have argued that the Fed failed to take away the\npunchbowl as the subprime party spun out of control, leaving rates too low for too long and not\nusing our regulatory powers to restrain excessive complacency in the pricing and monitoring of\nrisk. But that is beside the point.\nNow we are faced with the consequences of a process that lawyers would call the “discovery\nphase”: As big banks and other financial agents confess their acts of fiduciary omission and\nexcesses of commission, credit markets have effectively de-leveraged important segments of the\neconomy, slowing growth suddenly and precipitously. Instead of taking the punchbowl away, the\nFederal Reserve is now faced with the task of replenishing the punch.\nYet at the same time, we are faced with the unprecedented consequence of demand-pull\ninflationary forces fueled by the voracious consumption of oil, wheat, corn, iron ore, steel and\ncopper, and all other kinds of commodities and inputs, including labor, among the 3 billion new\nparticipants in the global economy. When it comes to these precious inputs, we have no control\nover the surging demand from China, India, Brazil, the countries of the former Soviet Union and\nother new growth centers, but we know that it is putting upward pressure on prices in our\neconomy. Economists note that the “income elasticity of demand” for food is higher in China\nand other emerging economies than in the United States. Many of these countries’ income\nelasticity of demand for oil and certain other vital commodities is greater than 1, meaning that\ntheir demand for these items will increase faster than their income. Even if growth slows\nsomewhat in some of these important emerging economies—the World Bank, for example,\nprojects China’s growth will be 9.6 percent in 2008, down from 11 percent last year—demand\nfor inputs relative to the world’s ability to supply them will likely continue to exert upward\npressure on key commodity prices.\nWe also know that the inflationary expectations of consumers and business leaders are impacted\nby what they pay for gasoline at the pump and food at the grocery store.\nMonetary policy acts with a lag. I liken it to a good single malt whiskey or perhaps truly great\ntequila: It takes time before you feel its full effect. The Fed has to be very careful now to add just\nthe right amount of stimulus to the punchbowl without mixing in the potential to juice up\ninflation once the effect of the new punch kicks in.\nWe have been hard at work trying to find the right mixture. Before the meeting last week, we had\nreduced the fed funds rate by 175 basis points in 18 weeks—cuts that I supported even though I\ndid not have a formal vote. During that time, we also initiated a new system for term money that\nhas auctioned $100 billion at rates below the official discount rate.\nMy dissenting vote last week was simply a difference of opinion about how far and how fast we\nmight re-spike the monetary punchbowl. Given that I had yet to see a mitigation in inflation and\n6\n\n\finflationary expectations from their current high levels, and that I believed the steps we had\nalready taken would be helpful in mitigating the downside risk to growth once they took full\neffect, I simply did not feel it was the proper time to support additional monetary\naccommodation.\nI respect the majority view of the committee. I sleep well at night knowing that the collective\nwisdom of the group is guided by one common goal: the continued prosperity of the American\npeople.\nBueno amigos míos, así es la vida de los que hacemos la política monetaria. Gracias por darme la\noportunidad de platicar con ustedes. Ha sido un gran placer. Espero que ahora que conocen más\nacerca de lo importante que es tener un banco central independiente, puedan salir de aquí\norgullosos del papel que juega el Banco de México en el desarrollo económico de este gran país.\nPor mi parte, después de contestar a sus preguntas, voy a taparme los oídos con cera, amarrarme\nal mástil, y esperar que el distinguido Gobernador Ortiz me ofrece unos tragos del “ponche”.\nUna vez más, gracias por su atención.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nJanuary 17, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fChallenges for Monetary Policy in a Globalized Economy\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Charlie [Plosser]. I am grateful for the invitation to speak to the Global\nInterdependence Center.\nI am going to take advantage of this podium to provide the Dallas Fed’s point of view, from a\nglobal perspective, on the issue that preoccupies President Plosser and me and our colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). That issue is the conduct of monetary policy\ngiven our current economic predicament. If you will indulge me, we can address other issues of\nglobal interdependence in the Q&A session. Before I get started, let me go on record as having\nsaid that, as always, I speak today only for myself and not for the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, its members or the Federal Reserve System.\nFirst, a word about Philadelphia. I spent a tad more than my Fed per diem last night and stayed at\nthe Ritz Carlton at Broad and Chestnut. Before it became a hotel, that monumental building\nhoused the old Girard Trust Company. True Philadelphians know the rock-solid financial legacy\nof Stephen Girard. In 1811, he bought the remaining shares in the First Bank of the United States\nand renamed it Girard’s Bank. History footnotes Girard’s Bank as the key financial backer of the\nU.S. during the War of 1812. According to one estimate, the value of Girard’s net worth at his\ndeath in 1831 was roughly $2 trillion in today’s dollars. Imagine: Girard made Warren Buffett\nlook like a piker! He and his bank were so financially solid that the saying “In Girard we trust”\nwas later morphed into the Girard Trust Company.\nIt was Girard Trust that took an interest in me in 1963 and gave my family the means to send me\nfar from home to a New Jersey boarding school. I never quite learned why they treated me so\nkindly, but I do remember my father saying that Girard had a soft spot for wayward boys from\n“challenged” backgrounds who might—just might—have some potential for salvation. I would\nnever have accumulated all those honors mentioned in President Plosser’s introduction, nor\nwould I have had the good life I have enjoyed, nor would I be addressing you today as a Federal\nReserve Bank president, had it not been for Girard Trust.\nSo I slept well last night in the bosom of that solid old building that was once a pillar of financial\nrectitude—a rare luxury for a policymaker in these fitful times.\nYou’d be hard pressed to find an economist or market operator in this city or anywhere else on\nthe planet who is not concerned about waning U.S. economic growth. Some analysts and\ncommentators sound like Chicken Littles. Others are less excitable, but are nevertheless\nassuming a defensive crouch. Most are mindful of recent developments in employment patterns,\nuneven retail sales and downward shifts in shipping, rail and trucking indexes, industrial activity,\nbusiness capex plans, credit card payables, purchasing manager activity and other carefully\nwatched indicators. These stresses follow on the severe housing downturn and the liquidity bind.\nThere is an increasingly insistent drumbeat urging the Fed not only to not impose contractionary\npolicy on a weakening economy, but indeed to get “ahead of the curve” through further monetary\naccommodation.\n1\n\n\fChairman Bernanke spoke last week and made it clear that the FOMC stands “ready to take\nsubstantive action needed to support growth and provide insurance against downside risks,”\nadding that “additional policy easing may well be necessary.” In short, he made clear that the\nFOMC does not intend to just squat and wait should economic data and sound risk management\nsignal that monetary accommodation is required.\nIt needs to be underscored that being proactive and not passive in doing our job does not mean\nthat we will abandon prudent decisionmaking. We are the central bank of the United States, the\nbellwether economy of the world. Our job is not to bail out imprudent decisionmakers or errant\nbankers, nor is it to directly support the stock market or to somehow make whole those money\nmanagers, financial engineers and real estate speculators who got it wrong. And it most\ndefinitely is not to err on the side of Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.\nIn fact, to benefit Main Street, we have a duty to maintain a financial system that enables\nAmerican capitalism to do its magic. To this end, we have recently taken steps designed to\ncircumvent bottlenecks in interbank lending—steps that include changing the operation of our\ndiscount window and opening a new term auction facility. This facility has provided $70 billion\nin funds in roughly a month and will soon provide another $30 billion, and perhaps even more\nover time if needed.\nIn setting broader monetary policy and the fed funds target rate, the Fed operates under a dual\nmandate. We are charged by Congress with creating the monetary conditions for sustainable,\nnoninflationary employment growth. Put more simply, our mandate is to grow employment and\nto contain inflation. Unstable prices are incompatible with sustainable job growth. Some critics\nworry that we have forgotten that axiom. We haven’t.\nLet me give you my personal view.\nIn discharging our dual mandate, we must be mindful that short-term fixes often lead to longterm problems. The Fed occupies a unique place in the pantheon of government institutions. It\nwas deliberately designed to be calm and steady, untainted by the passion of the moment and\nimmune to political exigency and influence. Because monetary policy’s effects spread into the\neconomy slowly and accumulate over time, having an itchy trigger finger with monetary policy\nrisks shooting everyone in the foot. Our policy mandate must be discharged with careful and\ndeliberate aim.\nIn the attention-deficit world of television and Internet commentary, where so-called “instant\nanalysis”—an oxymoron if there ever was one—makes headlines, it is easy to understand why\none might think that the effect of a change in the fed funds rate would immediately alter the\ndynamic of the economy. To be sure, movement in the fed funds rate, or even no movement at\nall, may have an immediate psychological effect and influence expectations for future monetary\npolicy action. But the act of changing or not changing the fed funds target rate, in and of itself,\nhas no immediate effect on the economy. Like a good single malt whiskey, the ameliorating or\nstimulating influence kicks in only with a lag.\nThe lag time necessary for inflation to respond to policy is especially long. As a policymaker\ndischarging our dual mandate, I am always mindful that in providing the monetary conditions for\nemployment growth, we must not also sow the seeds of inflation that will eventually choke off\n2\n\n\fthe very employment growth we seek to encourage. You do not have to be an inflation “hawk” to\nrecognize that would be a Faustian bargain.\nThose of you who follow my speeches—probably a very small number of you with way too\nmuch time on your hands—will recall that I like neither the term “hawk” nor “dove.” I like to\nthink that all FOMC members are best metaphorically described in ornithological terms as\n“owls”—wise women and men seeking to achieve the right balance in carrying out our dual\nmandate. To be owlish, and to avoid the imbalance of emphasis that gave rise to needed harsh\ndiscipline imposed by the Volcker FOMC, one has to bear in mind that the seeds of inflation,\nonce planted, can lie fallow for some time, then suddenly burst through the economic topsoil like\nkudzu, requiring a near-toxic dose of countermeasures to overcome.\nIn the pre-Volcker era, the Fed had a less-than-admirable record of keeping inflation at bay. But\nover the past few decades, we have done well enough to both contain inflation and engender\ngrowth that far outpaced other advanced economies for a sustained period with only a smattering\nof short recessions. In short, the Fed has delivered on its mandate.\nTo be sure, we have been profoundly impacted by the shifting economic dynamics that have\ncomplicated our efforts to continue delivering on our mandate. I need not try to convince\nmembers and supporters of the Global Interdependence Center that we are living in a globalized\nworld. Increasingly, globalization is blurring economic boundaries. On the inflation front, for\nexample, we have extensive economic playbooks that tell us how to treat the wage–price spiral\nor cost-push forces in a closed economy. In a closed environment, one would ordinarily expect\nthat a weakening economy would lead, in turn, to a diminution in price pressures. But we have\nless experience with prescribing policy in an open economy where demand-pull forces come\nfrom beyond our borders—such as the burgeoning demand for commodities and food from\nrapidly growing and newly consequential economies like China, India, Latin America and the\ncountries liberated from the oppression of Soviet communism. These faraway places play an\never-increasing role in determining prices here at home.\nWriting in last Sunday’s New York Times, Ben Stein noted this and that the Fed does not have\nmuch power to influence the price of oil. 1 He is right. And for that matter, we can’t do much\nabout the external demand impacting the price of food—which, by the way, carries twice the\nweight of energy in the consumer basket of personal consumption expenditures. But the\ndynamics of production and demand among the new participants in the global economy\nnonetheless impact us in different ways at different times. As these new participants joined the\nglobal economy, they provided significant tailwinds, helping us grow by providing cost savings,\nnew sources of productivity enhancement and new sources of demand, helping fatten both the\ntop line and bottom line of our businesses while also holding down inflation. Under such\nconditions, the Fed could operate with a more accommodative monetary policy than what might\nhave been appropriate in a closed economy, without putting upward pressure on inflation. And\nthat is what the Fed did, although some argue—with the benefit of hindsight—it did so for too\nlong.\nI think it is now clear that the winds have shifted. The growing appetite for raw inputs from the\nnew participants in the global economy represents an inflationary headwind that is unlikely to\n1\n\n“Larry, Curly, Moe and the Economy,” The New York Times, page BU4, January 13, 2008.\n3\n\n\fsoon abate. The so-called “income elasticity of demand” for energy is 1.2 across a wide range of\ncountries, which is a fancy way of saying that economic theory should lead one to conclude that\nthe demand for energy in, say, China, for example, would begin to grow faster than China’s\nincome growth, which continues to increase at a rapid rate. Put more simply, income growth in\nChina and India and elsewhere, even if it slows from its torrid pace, is likely to continue raising\ndemand for food and energy. There is a risk that upward price pressures will continue to affect\nAmerican producers and consumers of energy and food products and a continuing danger that\noverall inflation expectations will drift upward as a result.\nIf I am correct, then the situation today is the flip side of the 1990s and early 2000s: In delivering\non our mandate to be monetary policy “owls,” we will have to err on the side of running tighter\npolicy than would otherwise be justified if we wish to limit upward inflation pressures.\nI mentioned single malt whiskey earlier to describe the effective time lags of monetary policy. I\nrealize it is only lunchtime, but let’s return to the economics liquor cabinet for a moment.\nInflation is like absinthe. The narcotic allure of inflation is a dangerous thing. It might seem like\nthe remedy to bail out a government or a bad book of business and forget your troubles. Yet our\nexperience in the past has taught us only too well that inflation is a dangerous elixir that\nultimately proves debilitating for businesses, consumers, investors—including those foreign\ninvestors who have lately come to the aid of some large balance sheets here—and especially for\nthe poor, the elderly and people on fixed incomes. It even inculcates bad financial behavioral\npatterns in the young by encouraging spending rather than investment and saving. Inflation is\nbad for Main Street and Wall Street and even for Sesame Street.\nYet we central bankers also traverse Lombard Street, and we know from Walter Bagehot that in\ntimes of crisis, liquidity is key. As a voter on the FOMC this year, I stand ready to take\nsubstantive action to support growth and provide insurance against downside risk, as long as\ninflation expectations remain contained.\nYou will note the operative qualifying words there were “as long as inflation expectations remain\ncontained.” Each of us looks to different indicators for a sense of inflation’s direction. Some\nperuse markets for signs of shifting expectations, looking, say, to the yield on Treasury InflationProtected Securities, or TIPS, or to the spread between yields in the forward markets between\nTIPS and nominal Treasuries at different points of the yield curve or all along the entire curve.\nPersonally, as a former market operator, I am wary of relying on Treasury spot or futures\nindicators during a flight to quality or at times when liquidity is at a premium, as investors may\nhave other preoccupations that trump or distort conventional inflation concerns.\nOthers look to surveys of consumers and professional forecasters, like those conducted by the\nUniversity of Michigan and the Philadelphia Fed. The latest, the University of Michigan survey,\nreleased in December, is forecasting headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation of 3.4\npercent, which is hardly comforting. The Philadelphia Fed survey, released last November,\nprovides a more palatable forecast of 2.4 percent for the next four quarters; yet if you plot that\nsurvey against actual headline inflation obtained for the last four years, it has more often than not\nunderestimated inflation’s true path.\nThe brow of a central banker considering further accommodation furrows further when looking\nat the inflation measures that form the basis for Main Street’s inflationary expectations—the CPI\n4\n\n\fand the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator. On a 12-month basis, the most\nrecent CPI, released yesterday, was running at a rate of 4.1 percent. The last PCE deflator,\nreleased in December, was 3.6 percent. The Trimmed Mean PCE Deflator, which the Dallas Fed\ntracks in an effort to eliminate “noise from signal” and as a basis for projecting inflation, is no\nlonger trending downward. Even the so-called “Core PCE,” which I personally consider least\nuseful because it eliminates food and energy prices, is rising rather than declining.\nOf course, what matters most is the future direction of inflation, not the past. In the course of\npreparing for each FOMC meeting, I regularly consult directly with some 30-plus CEOs to\ndevelop a sense of future business activity, including cost and pricing developments. I have\nfound this rigorous exercise to be extremely helpful in placing our staff’s econometric analysis in\ncontext as I have prepared for FOMC meetings in the past, and I will be listening especially\ncarefully to these business operators’ reports on inflation-related developments as I prepare for\nupcoming FOMC meetings.\nIn my view, the degree of substantive action to support economic growth and insure against\ndownside risk will be conditioned by what we see coming down the inflation pike. To deliver on\nits dual mandate, the Fed must keep one ear cocked toward signs that inflationary expectations\nare drifting upward as we execute additional monetary measures.\nLet me bring this home to Philadelphia. In 1748, Benjamin Franklin wrote an “Advice to a\nYoung Tradesman.” In it, he speaks in the language of the day of the concepts of opportunity\ncost and of the power of compound interest—pretty precocious stuff for those times. Of the\nmoney supply, he wrote that “the more there is of it, the more it produces [at] every turning, so\nthat the profits rise quicker and quicker.” Yet he also warns in earthy terms of the dangers of\nbeing too prolific. “He that kills a breeding sow,” Franklin warned, “destroys all her offspring to\nthe thousandth generation. He that murders a crown [the currency of the day], destroys all that it\nmight have produced….”\nThe late Dame Mary Douglas was no Ben Franklin. Nor was she a Philadelphian. She was a\nbrilliant British economic anthropologist who wrote a pathbreaking book titled Purity and\nDanger. In it, she wrote something that Franklin or Stephen Girard or any good central banker\nsince the onset of time has understood implicitly: “Money can only perform its role of\nintensifying economic interaction if the public has faith in it. If that faith is shaken, the currency\nis useless.”\nLike Charlie and my other colleagues, I have every desire to use monetary policy to intensify\neconomic interaction, to keep breeding jobs and growing our economy, so that we might keep\nAmerica strong to the thousandth generation. I have no intention of being party to any action that\nmight shake faith in the dollar. The challenge to monetary policy, as I see it, is to achieve the\ngrowth part of our mandate in the short term and get “ahead of the curve” without shaking faith\nin the currency over the long term.\nI know that the GIC has other things on its mind than just monetary policy. So let me stop there\nand answer any questions you might have.\n\n5\n\n\f"
