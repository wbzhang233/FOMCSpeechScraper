        "content": "Digits and Widgets\n(With Reference to a Wise Mother, the Golden Book\nEncyclopedia, Winston Churchill and Hunter Lawrence)\nRemarks before the Austin Chamber of Commerce’s\n4th Annual State of Education in Austin\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nAustin, Texas\nDecember 8, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fDigits and Widgets\n(With Reference to a Wise Mother, the Golden Book Encyclopedia,\nWinston Churchill and Hunter Lawrence)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Barry [Mayer].\nThere are many distinguished Texans in this room. I would like to single out one of them: my\ndaughter, Alison. I am very proud of her. She inherited her mother’s brains and graduated with\nhonors in English literature from Harvard, where she was president of the Seneca, one of the\nlargest women’s service organizations on the Harvard campus. Alison is now a graduate student\nat UT–Austin, in her second year at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. She is not only smart and\nstrong and beautiful, but she is tolerant—so much so, she is even willing to sit through one of her\nfather’s speeches. I am thrilled she is here.\nEducation is something I hold dear to my heart. It changed my life. Neither of my parents—\nAlison’s paternal grandparents—was formally educated. My father never made it past fourth\ngrade. In lieu of middle school and high school, he swept floors under the lathes at a\nmetalworking factory in Australia. My mother, a stern Norwegian raised in South Africa,\nattended the equivalent of a secretarial high school. They wanted better for me. Among the many\nfond memories I have of my mother, God rest her soul, two came to mind as I prepared this little\nsermon for today. The first was our twice-monthly trek when I was 12 to a local store to get the\nlatest installment of the Golden Book Encyclopedia—these were the only books we could readily\nafford in our household at the time. Golden Books issued one volume per letter of the alphabet,\nand she insisted I read it cover to cover in order to ―earn‖ the next volume. The second was her\nadmonition that I had ―better do well in school and learn to love to learn‖ because, in her stern\nwords, ―you can’t expect to get by in America just relying on your looks or your athletic ability.‖\nIn his introduction, Barry listed all those great schools I was lucky to attend and all the fancy\njobs I’ve had—shorthand in our resume-driven society for ―he’s done all right.‖ All that can be\ntraced back to a determined mother and the Golden Book Encyclopedia, as well as some\ninspirational teachers in primary and secondary school and a pragmatic father. When I got my\nM.B.A. from Stanford, my dad pulled me aside and said: ―Enough already. In one generation,\nwe’ve gone from no education to too much! Now get a job and go to work!‖\nI have a job to do today, so I better go to work speaking on the topic you asked me here for: the\nsubject of education.\nThe benefits we derive from the books and the buildings and the teachers and tutors that form the\nbuilding blocks of our educational society don’t stop at the classroom door. They spread\noutward, affecting our lives and the lives of others around us in innumerable ways. Today I am\ngoing to speak from the perspective of the economy and living standards, a principal\npreoccupation of the Federal Reserve.\n\n1\n\n\fThere are countless studies in the economics literature that highlight the links between increases\nin educational levels and economic productivity and improvements in society’s welfare.\nEmployment is significantly higher among the more educated. Workers with a college degree\nexperience lower fluctuations in employment and, if they do lose their jobs in tough times such\nas these, do so at a lower rate than their less-educated peers and are more likely to find new jobs.\nThe simple fact is you earn what you learn. Education pays off. We can see this in the wage data\nprovided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last year, the average hourly wage in Texas was\n$18.90. In the same period, the average hourly wage in Texas for internal medicine doctors was\n$77.22, $42.67 for geological engineers, $43.50 for computer engineers and $29.70 for nurses.\nThe more you learn, the more you earn.\nIn 1980, a college degree would earn you about 50 percent more than a high school diploma. In\n1990, that differential jumped to 73 percent and, in 2000, to 85 percent. Today, someone who\nholds a college degree earns 97 percent more than his or her classmate who went no further than\nhigh school.\nYou earn what you learn. Higher education is the key to improved earnings and social prosperity.\nThis is no great mystery. We make our living as Americans less with our muscles than we do\nwith our brains. At the beginning of the 20th century, when my parents were born, 37 percent of\nthe U.S. workforce was employed in agriculture. Today, in Alison’s world, agricultural output\nrepresents less than 2 percent of our gross domestic product and employs just over 1 percent of\nour workers. In 1900, 38 percent of our labor force worked in ―industry,‖ a broad category that\nincludes manufacturing, construction and mining. Today, manufacturing employs 10 percent of\nour workforce, and mining—less than 1 percent.\nThe delivery of services has replaced ag and manufacturing and mining and oil and gas and is the\nengine of our growth. At the beginning of the 20th century, 26 percent of our workforce was\nemployed in services. Today that number is about 80 percent. We are a service-driven economy.\nWinston Churchill used to refer in his speeches to the ―superfine processes‖ that added value to\nbasic raw material inputs in the era when Britannia ruled the waves of the Manufacturing Age\neconomy. Today, we live at an ever-higher end of the value-added spectrum, with education\nbeing the stuff of our economic success.\nWe have the most efficient services workers in the world. Contrary to popular belief, we sell\nthose services not just at home, but around the globe. Sales of things like computer and\ninformation services, research and development, accounting and auditing, and management and\nconsulting earn us substantial foreign income—so much so that while we run a deficit in our\ntrade in goods with the rest of the world, we run a surplus in our trade in services. It trims our\noverall trade deficit some 20 percent from what it would otherwise be.\nEven lawyers make money abroad. Imagine that! Our exports of legal services in 2008 were four\ntimes our imports. In the same year, exports in advertising, finance, medical services and\neducation exceeded our imports in these categories by a factor of three. And thanks to Brad Pitt\nand Tom Cruise and Angelina Jolie and Jessica Simpson—and, indeed, despite Sunday night’s\nignominious defeat, Jessica’s ex, Tony Romo—our foreign distribution of films, TV shows,\n2\n\n\fperforming arts and sports programming and products are in such tremendous demand abroad\nthat their overseas sales exceed our imports by a factor of seven.\nThe point is this: The fields and factories that powered the economy of yesterday remain\nimportant in the United States and in Texas. But more important in the current economy and to\nour economic future is the production of high-value-added services. As some have previously\nnoted, in the world of ―superfine processes‖ of the Knowledge Age, digits are the new widgets.\nThe brain is to the Knowledge Age and the mastery of digits what the engine was to the\nManufacturing Age and the management of widgets. Education is the steam and the oil and the\ngas that propel that engine. The speed at which we move our economy forward from this point\nonward will depend on how well we educate our children. We cannot produce the skilled labor\nneeded to advance this economy without a top-notch educational system—one that relentlessly\npushes America farther up the value-added ladder while the Chinese and the Indians and others\nscurry up the lower rungs of that ladder with their billions of eager workers and ever-more agile\ngrasp of the most basic tools of technology.\nAs I understand this conference, you all are here to ―grade [your] own paper‖—to assess your\nefforts to create a top-notch educational system here in this great city and state.\nGene [Austin], you wrote a comprehensive piece on this subject just last month in the Austin\nAmerican-Statesman. I agree that many efforts undertaken at the state and local levels—like the\n―20,010 by 2010‖ initiative—are producing real results. But we cannot declare victory yet. We\nhave many, many miles to go before we sleep.\nPersonally, I will not sleep until we get our higher education house in order. For a state as great\nas Texas, we are woefully lacking in tier-one universities.\nI want you to consider the following. It is fashionable in economic and financial circles to talk\nabout the ―BRIC‖ nations: Brazil and Russia, India and China. Yet, in the second quarter of this\nyear, Texas produced more than two of those four countries did: more than Russia and more than\nIndia. And we were not all that far behind Brazil. You heard me correctly. The 24 million people\nof the Lone Star State, in the second quarter of this year, produced more in dollar-denominated\neconomic output than the 1.1 billion people of India or the 140 million of Russia, at then-current\nexchange rates, and about 81 percent of what Brazil produced with half of South America’s\npopulation and just under half of South America’s land mass.\nTexas is a global economic power, surpassed in the United States only by California. So far, so\ngood. But as you look into the future of the Knowledge Age and contemplate the ambition of the\nBRIC countries and others that will compete with us for a piece of the global economic pie, the\npicture darkens.\nConsider this: Texas has six major public university systems. The University of Texas System,\nwhose home is right here in Austin, is the granddaddy of them all, with just under 200,000\nstudents in nine universities and six health institutions. The Texas A&M System has 11\nuniversities with 100,000-plus students and a multicampus health science center. The remaining\nstudents are spread over the campuses of the Texas State University System, the University of\nNorth Texas System, the University of Houston System and the Texas Tech System. Stephen F.\n3\n\n\fAustin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and Texas Woman’s are each independent public\nuniversities. Together, these institutions house over 530,000 students.\nBy contrast, California has more than 650,000 students enrolled at just 33 public campuses. The\ngranddaddy of that state educational system is the University of California, with 220,000\nstudents spread over 10 universities.\nHow many people in this room think that Berkeley is the only center of excellence in the\nUniversity of California System? Not one of you. That is because you know that in addition to\nBerkeley, the University of California System has UCLA, UC–San Diego, UC–Irvine, UC–\nDavis and UC–Santa Barbara. All that before you take into account Stanford, USC, Caltech and\nthe Claremont Colleges.\nNow here is a fact we must face up to. According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey,\nBerkeley, UCLA, UC–San Diego, UC–Davis, UC–Santa Barbara and UC–Irvine all outranked\nour beloved UT–Austin—which placed 47th—for overall educational excellence. And the rest of\nour universities? The Aggies in College Station ranked 61st. The Mustangs of SMU ranked 68th,\nthe Baylor Bears 80th and the Horned Frogs of TCU, 110th. The shining stars of our higher\neducation galaxy are the appropriately named Owls of Rice, ranked 17th behind Johns Hopkins,\ntied with Vanderbilt and above Berkeley.\nIt galls me that the ―overtaxed, overregulated, left coast state‖ of California has within one fleet\nsix universities that are ranked better than UT–Austin, our flagship. It bothers me to no end that\nwe have only one university in our state that ranks in the top 20 in the nation.\nWhen you get a chance, take a look at the membership list for the Association of American\nUniversities (AAU), which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the\ncrop of research universities. The AAU consists of 60 U.S. and two Canadian universities. These\n60 U.S. schools garner about 57 percent of all federal R&D dollars to colleges and universities;\nthey are home to 81 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the\nNational Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each\nof those fields. Since 1901, 35 percent of all Nobel Prizes have gone to individuals affiliated with\nAAU universities. It is fair to say that everyone in this room would like to have our Texas\nuniversities included in this prestigious group of 60.\nCalifornia has nine AAU members, with four of those in the greater Los Angeles area alone.\nNew York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook\nUniversity, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. You actually should add\nan eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm’s reach of New York City.\nAnd Texas? We have three: Rice, UT–Austin and Texas A&M.\nThink about it. The great state of Texas—the state I love to brag and boast about, a state that has\na glorious history second to none—has the same number of AAU member universities as Boston.\nThe Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex—my hometown—has … none. Think about that: The fourthlargest metropolitan district in America does not have a single top-ranked academic institution.\nWe do have UT–Southwestern, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a medical school\n4\n\n\fstanding alone, no matter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on advanced\ntechnology and in-depth knowledge across many fields.\nNow, how can we expect to navigate our way into the economic future in a fiercely competitive\nglobalized world without a single elite university in Dallas? Or with only one in the great city of\nHouston? With a university ranked 47th in Austin? And with none of the top 50 in any other city\nin Texas? How can we expect Texas to continue to outproduce India and Russia and other\nhungry competitors and excel in the Knowledge Age—an era in which prosperity and wealth will\nbe defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics and biology and mathematics-driven\nfinancial expertise—with so few established fountainheads of advanced knowledge? How can\nwe reasonably expect to prepare the youth of today—a group that I know you all care about, or\nelse you would not have sacrificed your time to be here—if we aren’t providing them with topnotch preparation for the economy of tomorrow?\nWhen we leave this luncheon today, I want you to look around Austin’s cityscape. When you\ntravel to Dallas or Houston or any of our other great cities, look at their skylines. How many\nfactories will you see? You won’t see any—at least none of the old-fashioned kind with\nsmokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass and steel\nbuildings that house the machines and the capital stock of the modern economy: human brains.\nBrains that are employed in many of the high-value-added sectors I described earlier.\nWe need more of that brainpower, right here in River City. We need thousands upon thousands\nof the world’s best and brightest here in Texas, here in Austin, and in Houston and Dallas and\nFort Worth and every nook and cranny of South and East and West Texas. We can fuel our\neconomy with graduates from California and Massachusetts and other states and other\ncountries—up to a point. But that is no substitute for Texas-bred intellectual talent, with its roots\nin our community and its commitment to building our state and all the benefits it would bring to\nour arts and civic and educational communities, on top of the economic muscle it would add.\nLike everybody in this room, I swelled with pride when I watched Hunter Lawrence put that\nfootball through the uprights in the last second of Saturday night’s game at the ―House that Jerry\nBuilt.‖ I delight in seeing TCU ranked among the nation’s top teams. As a former high school\nquarterback, I love dropping in on high school games on Friday nights. And whenever I lecture\nthese days at our universities across the state, I can’t help but notice how handsome or beautiful\nthe young men and women are in our classrooms.\nBut then I think back to my mother’s admonition: ―You can’t expect to get by in America just\nrelying on your looks or your athletic ability.‖ We can’t expect Texas to get by, let alone\ndominate, in a globalized economy where digits are the new widgets simply by relying on our\ngood looks and athletic prowess.\nHere is the punch line: If you are willing to leave this room today accepting the fact that we have\nonly two universities ranked in the top 50 in the nation and only one, Rice, in the top 20, then\nyou are not the Texans I know and love. If you are willing to accept that the Longhorns of UT–\nAustin, mighty as they are, are outflanked on the educational battlefield by six campuses of the\nUC System, then I have severely overestimated your commitment to this great state of ours. If\nany of you are willing to accept that Guy Bailey at Texas Tech or David Daniel at the University\nof Texas at Dallas or Gerald Turner at SMU or Victor Boschini at TCU or Ricardo Romo at UT–\n5\n\n\fSan Antonio or Diana Natalicio at UTEP or Renu Khator at the University of Houston or Bowen\nLoftin at Texas A&M or William Powers here at UT–Austin is fighting with one hand tied\nbehind his or her back because the powers-that-be here in the capital cannot rise to the cause and\ngive to this state what California has in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or Los Angeles or San\nDiego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, then, well,\nyou, my friends, are suffering from a serious case of denial.\n―Denying‖ the people of Texas the tier-one universities they deserve presents a serious barrier to\nour future prosperity. We face many challenges head-on in this state. This is the biggest\nchallenge of all. Face up to it, and get on with it. Thank you.\n\n6\n\n\f"

        "content": "Remarks Before the 6th Annual YMCA\nKey Leaders Lunch\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nDecember 2, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fRemarks Before the 6th Annual YMCA Key Leaders Lunch\nRichard W. Fisher\nI was tempted to title this speech ―A Trip to Egypt,‖ for just as there are myths and suppositions\nabout ancient Egypt, all too often, the business of the Federal Reserve has been viewed as a\nriddle wrapped inside a mystery inside an enigma. This afternoon, I would like to take some of\nmy time with you to unlock that mystery—to take a peek into the inner sanctum. I’ll then end\nwith a word about our economic future in this great region of this great state.\nDespite the general mystique that traditionally surrounds central banking, I would bet that at\nleast some of the folks in this room are familiar with William McChesney Martin—the man who\nserved as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board longer than anyone else in the institution’s\nhistory.\nWhile some of you might recall that Bill Martin was a longtime chairman of the Fed, far fewer of\nyou are likely familiar with his failed bid—and I use the word ―bid‖ very generously—for the\npresidency. Let me explain. Once a year, a group called the Alfalfa Club—one of the great\ninstitutions in Washington, D.C.—holds a dinner devoted solely to poking fun at the political\npretensions of the day. Tongue firmly in cheek, the club nominates a candidate to run for the\npresidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course, none of them ever win. Nominees are\nthenceforth known as members of the Stassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who lost his\nbid for the presidency nine times before running and subsequently losing a tenth time on the\nAlfalfa ticket. The group’s motto is ―Veni, Vidi, Defici,‖ a phrase loosely taken from the Latin\nfor ―I came, I saw, I lost.‖\nIn 1966, while serving as Fed chairman under his fourth president, Bill Martin was nominated to\nrun for the American presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. In his acceptance speech, he\nannounced in jest that, given his proclivities as a central banker, he would take his cues from the\nGerman philosopher Goethe, ―who said that people could endure anything except continual\nprosperity.‖ Therefore, Martin continued, he would adopt a platform to ―make life endurable\nagain, by stamping out prosperity.‖\n―I shall conduct the administration of the country,‖ he said, ―exactly as I have so successfully\nconducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that\ncan be found…ask their advice on all matters…and completely confound them by following all\ntheir conflicting counsel.‖\nMartin gave his Alfalfa Club speech some 52 years after Congress passed the Federal Reserve\nAct and President Woodrow Wilson signed it into law so as to encourage, not stamp out,\neconomic prosperity. One of the more successful and brilliant aspects of this legislation was the\ncreation of the 12 regional banks. The Fed could have been set up solely in Washington, like so\nmany other institutions of the central government. Having representatives from all parts of the\ncountry, however, brings a deeper, more diverse perspective (and occasional ―conflicting\ncounsel‖!), unfettered by politics or political imperatives, to the policy debate at the meetings of\n1\n\n\fthe Open Market Committee when we collectively determine monetary policy, giving a clearer\nview of what is really happening in the U.S. economy. The regional banks maintain branch\noffices in cities within their district to stay in touch with local economic conditions and business\nleaders. In the case of the Dallas Fed, we maintain branches in Houston, San Antonio and El\nPaso.\nIf you truly wish to unlock the mysteries of the Fed—to take a peek into the inner sanctum—you\nshould start by learning a little about the businesses we operate in Dallas as a part of the central\nbank of the United States.\nWhen I was a student at Oxford, the great insurance magnate of that time, Clement Stone, came\nto speak at the Oxford Union. A student asked him to kindly share with the audience what he\nconsidered the key to success. He looked out at the audience, curled up his Ronald Coleman\nmustache and said: ―In one word: cash.‖ So let’s start there. One of the duties of the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks and their branches and depots is to provide to the banks in their districts what\nClement Stone considered the key to success: cash.\nOur main cash vault in Dallas is the size of a five-story building. That vault holds lots of Federal\nReserve banknotes—what you might know as dollar bills. Through the third quarter of this year,\nwe distributed and received 4.2 billion circulating banknotes, worth nearly $76 billion at face\nvalue. That’s almost $490 million in cash passing through our Pearl Street vaults every day. This\nis a thing of beauty to watch. Our mammoth machines scan the cash at an average rate just shy of\n100,000 bills per hour. They cull about 780 counterfeit bills each month. They pluck out almost\n39 million worn bills each month—valued at $538 million—and we then shred them and send\nthem off to Money Heaven. The life span of a typical $1 bill, incidentally, is just 21 months. A\n$20 bill lasts 2 years, and a $100 bill—the largest denomination of currency in circulation since\n1969—lasts nearly seven and a half years.\nWe also process checks. From January through September of 2009, the Dallas Fed processed\n69.2 million checks, worth about $58.4 billion. Over the same period, we’ve handled a daily\naverage of 364,000 paper checks—although that business has been, and will continue to be, on a\nsubstantial decline. Due to advances in technology, many banks now send us checks\nelectronically in a digital format. We received and processed an average of 543,000 electronic\nimages each day through the first three quarters of this year.\nAnother important function of the Dallas Fed is to provide liquidity to District depository\ninstitutions through our discount window operations—to be what some have called a banker’s\nbank. The lending programs that make up our discount window help relieve liquidity strains by\nproviding a source of short-term funding, which must be fully secured, to depository institutions\nin times of need. In 2008, we made 273 loans approximating $30 billion. I chair our credit\ncommittee and personally review the loans we make every evening. Some of them are very large\n(a billion or more) and some very small (as little as $10,000), depending on the needs of the\nborrowing bank, for overnight purposes or, during the recent financial crisis, up to 84 days so\nthat they might conduct uninterrupted business on behalf of their customers.\nAmong our other responsibilities is supervising the banking industry within our respective\ndistrict. We conduct on-site audits of our member banks and monitor bank performance and\nstability measures using electronic surveillance technologies.\n2\n\n\fThis supervisory role is important. I began my private-sector career at the bank of Brown\nBrothers Harriman & Co., where my superiors instilled in me one overarching principle—one\nI’m sure the bankers in this room know quite well: Know your customer. Well, we at the Fed\nrely upon our regulatory relationship to better ―know our customers,‖ actively monitoring our\nconstituents’ needs and services on the front-line of the commercial banking industry.\nThe Dallas Fed has also launched public education programs designed to raise financial and\neconomic literacy in our community. We frequently host public events and conferences on\nsignificant activities within our economy.\nWe also do serious economic research, designed to provide the intellectual heft for informed\nmonetary policymaking. Our Research Department employs a crack team of economists and\nanalysts who study the local, national and international economies. Their work is top-notch. Few\nof you might know, for example, that Finn Kydland, an associate of our research team here in\nDallas for the past 15 years, won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2004.\nLike many of our other operations, our research function is spread among our branches. In\naddition to tracking trends across Texas, our economists in San Antonio and Houston and El\nPaso maintain a keen interest in subjects like the U.S.–Mexico border economy and energy\nmarkets.\nThe Dallas Fed has also taken upon itself the job of contemplating how globalization impacts the\nexecution of monetary policy with the formation of the Globalization and Monetary Policy\nInstitute. While still in its nascent stages, this group has produced a hefty volume of original\nwork and collaborated with top minds around the world to devise new theories and models to\nunderstand this oft-overlooked economic link. This Institute is privileged to have on its board the\ncentral bank governors of Japan, Singapore and Mexico; the Deputy Governor of the Bank of\nEngland; the former deputy of the European Central Bank and other notables that help bring an\ninformed global perspective to our work and, I might add, help us showcase Dallas to the world.\nWhile currency processing, banking supervision and research efforts are an important part of the\nFed’s job, they are certainly not the part of central banking that garners the most public attention.\nThe sexier bits of what I do—to the extent anything in central banking is considered ―sexy‖—\ndeal with monetary policy.\nAs president of one of the 12 regional banks I described earlier, I have the privilege of serving on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee: the Fed’s central policymaking body. Together with the\nfive Board governors (two shy of normal, thanks to a hold-up in the nomination and confirmation\nprocess), we meet every six weeks to discuss the current trajectory of the economy and craft the\nappropriate policy response.\nOur statement, released like clockwork at 2:15 Eastern time, outlines the committee’s thoughts\nand subsequent policy actions. Parenthetically, I might note that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee is one of the few decisionmaking bodies in the world where members can come\ntogether and, in the span of only a few hours, present their positions vociferously, agree to a\ncourse of action, craft a statement for public release and, most importantly, break in time for\nlunch.\n3\n\n\fIt is also a place where Texas, like the other states, has a voice at the table of making policy for\nthe most powerful and essential central bank in the world. The President of the United States\nappoints and the Senate confirms the governors of the Federal Reserve System. The member\nbankers in Texas and the Eleventh District elect a nine-member board of directors—similar to\nthe other 12 regional banks. Those boards hire and fire the bank presidents.\nI was hired by a board led by Ray Hunt. Presently, I serve at the pleasure of a board of directors\nthat includes Herb Kelleher; Mike Ullman, the chairman and CEO of J.C. Penney; Margaret\nJordan, the president and CEO of Dallas Medical Resource; and Bob Estrada, who most people\nin this room know, among others. I mention this to underscore that I and my fellow bank\npresidents represent Main Street and not the Washington political establishment or Wall Street.\nAnd I want you to know that every time I speak or intervene in our policy discussion at the\nFOMC—which is quite often—I do so very much with that in mind.\nSuffice it to say that those who serve alongside me in the hallowed halls of the Federal Reserve\nspend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty. You should take comfort in\nthat fact.\nNow, I know, Gordie, that you wanted me to say a few words on the economy. In a word it is\nimproving. But slowly. The national economy is trying to work its way out of our [AD LIB]. If\nyou will indulge me, I’d like to wrap up my remarks with a discussion of an issue that I hold near\nand dear to my heart—one that has a significant effect on this region’s future and economic\nprosperity and is key to our long-term economic success as a city and as a state.\nDallas–Fort Worth is the fourth-most-populous metropolitan area in the country and the sixthmost economically productive. Texas ranks second in the nation in population and productivity,\nsurpassed on both fronts only by California. We produce more economic output in the Lone Star\nState than India does. Or Mexico. We are a global economic power.\nTexas has six major public university systems. The University of Texas System is the\ngranddaddy of them all, with just under 200,000 students in nine universities and six health\ninstitutions. The Texas A&M System has eleven universities with 100,000-plus students and a\nmulticampus health science center. The remaining students are spread over the campuses of the\nTexas State University System, the University of North Texas System, the University of Houston\nSystem and the Texas Tech System. Stephen F. Austin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and\nTexas Woman’s are each independent public universities. Together, these institutions house over\n530,000 students.\nBy contrast, California has more than 650,000 students enrolled at just 33 public campuses. The\ngranddaddy of that state educational system is the University of California, with 220,000\nstudents spread over 10 universities.\nHow many people in this room think that Berkeley is the only center of excellence in the\nUniversity of California System? Not one of you. And that is because you know that in addition\nto Berkeley, the University of California System has UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC\nDavis and UC Santa Barbara. All that before you take into account Stanford, USC, CalTech and\nthe Claremont Colleges.\n4\n\n\fNow here is a fact. According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey, Berkeley, UCLA,\nUC San Diego, UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine all outranked UT Austin—which\nplaced 47th—for overall educational excellence. And the rest of our universities? Texas A&M\nwas ranked 61st. SMU ranked 68th, Baylor 80th and TCU—despite the high rankings of its\npowerhouse football club—110th. The shining star in our higher education galaxy is Rice,\nranked 17th, behind Johns Hopkins and tied with Vanderbilt and above Berkeley.\nHold that thought: The ―overtaxed, over-regulated, left-coast state‖ of California has within one\nfleet six universities that are ranked equal to or better than UT Austin, our flagship.\nNow let’s broaden our aperture a little by looking at membership in the Association of American\nUniversities, which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the crop of\nresearch universities. The AAU consists of 60 U.S. and two Canadian universities. These 60 U.S.\nschools garner about 57 percent of all federal R&D dollars to colleges and universities; they are\nhome to 81 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Science, the National\nAcademy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those\nfields. Since 1901, 35 percent of all Nobel Prizes have gone to individuals affiliated with AAU\nuniversities. It is fair to say that everyone in this room would like to have our Texas universities\nincluded in this prestigious group of 60.\nCalifornia has nine AAU members, with four of those in the greater Los Angeles area alone.\nNew York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook\nUniversity, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. You actually should add\nan eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm’s reach of New York City.\nAnd Texas? We have three: Rice, UT Austin and Texas A&M.\nThink about that. The great state of Texas—the state I love to brag and boast about; a state of\nover 24 million people that has a glorious history second to none and an economic powerhouse\nthat produces more than India or Mexico—has the same number of AAU member universities as\nthe greater Boston area. And Dallas, our hometown…has none. Think about that: The eighthlargest city in America does not have a single top-ranked academic institution. We do have UT\nSouthwestern, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a medical school standing alone, no\nmatter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on advanced technology and in-depth\nknowledge across many fields.\nNow, how can we expect to navigate our way into the economic future without a single elite\nuniversity in our city? How can we expect Dallas to excel in the Knowledge Age—the era in\nwhich economic prosperity and wealth will be defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics\nand biology and mathematics-driven financial expertise—without at least one established\nfountainhead of advanced knowledge? How can we reasonably expect the youth of Dallas—a\ngroup that I know people like Gordie and the good folks in this room care very much about—if\nwe aren’t providing them with top-notch preparation for the economy of tomorrow?\nEconomists may quibble about a lot of things, but they are united on this: Education pays off.\nWe can see it in wage data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The U.S. economy today\nis far different than the one that employed our parents and grandparents in the fields and\n5\n\n\ffactories. Agriculture represents less than 2 percent of our national economy. Oil, gas and mining\naccount for 5 percent. Manufacturing employs nearly 10 percent of our workforce. Roughly 80\npercent of American workers are employed in services, a sprawling sector that includes some of\nthe nation’s most prestigious and highest-paying jobs. In Texas, average hourly wages in 2008\nwere $77.22 for internal medicine doctors, $42.67 for geological engineers, $43.50 for computer\nsoftware engineers and $29.70 for registered nurses, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics\nestimates. Those are handsome earnings compared to Texas’ overall average hourly rate of\n$18.90. We want as many of our people as possible working in those higher income brackets.\nAnd the only way to accomplish that is to build our prowess in higher education.\nWhen we leave this luncheon today, I want you to look around Dallas’ cityscape. Tell me how\nmany factories you see. You won’t see one—at least not any of the old-fashioned kind with\nsmokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass and steel\nbuildings that house the machines and the capital stock of the modern economy: human brains.\nThose brains are employed in many of the high-value-added sectors I just described.\nThe brain is to this Knowledge Age what the motor was to the Industrial Age. And education is\nthe oil, the fuel that drives the knowledge economy forward.\nWe need more of that brain power, right here in River City. We need thousands upon thousands\nof the world’s best and brightest here in Dallas. We can fuel our economy with graduates from\nCalifornia and Massachusetts and other states and other countries—up to a point. But that is no\nsubstitute for Texas- and Dallas-bred intellectual talent, with its roots in the community and its\ncommitment to building Big D and all the benefits it would bring to the arts and civic and\neducational communities on top of the economic muscle it would add.\nI referred to Egypt at the beginning. Here’s the punch line. If any of you leave this room today\nwilling to accept the fact that Dallas, Texas, does not have one university ranked in the top 60 by\neither U.S. News & World Report or the Association of American Universities, then you are not\nthe Dallas-ites whom I know and love. If any of you are willing to accept that David Daniel at\nthe University of Texas at Dallas or Gerald Turner at Southern Methodist University or Daniel\nPodolsky at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center or Victor Boschini at Texas\nChristian University or Jim Spaniolo at the University of Texas at Arlington is fighting with one\nhand tied behind his back because the powers that be in Texas cannot rise above parochialism\nand give to this city what California has in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or Los Angeles or\nSan Diego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, then,\nwell, you, my friends, are, as they say, in Egypt—suffering a serious case of denial.\nThank you.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Fisher\nThank you, Tom [Granger], for that kind introduction.\nComing in from the airport, I again saw that fabled bumper sticker calling on local voters to\n“Keep Austin Weird.” It reminded me of the old saw that Washington is 10 square miles\nsurrounded by reality.\nAustin might be justly proud to consider itself 272 square miles surrounded by normality. But I\nknow better. When I made my hapless run for the U.S. Senate in 1994, I managed to visit every\nnook and cranny of this state. I know from personal experience that, thankfully, there is nothing\nnormal about Texas.\nTake my wife’s family, for example. Her great-great grandfather was William Miles. He hailed\nfrom Nip ’n Tuck, a little town near what is now Longview in East Texas. He served gallantly in\nthe Mexican Wars and then, after a substantial interlude, joined the 14th Regiment of the Texas\nUnmounted Cavalry—they had no horses but they were proud Texans and called themselves\n“cavalry” nonetheless—and went off to fight for the Confederacy. He had his arm shot off in\nbattle, was discharged and sent home. To get back, he swam across the Mississippi—no small\nfeat for a one-armed man. He is memorialized by the nickname “Sidestroke” in the family\nannals. Old “Sidestroke” then walked back to Nip ’n Tuck to become a dirt farmer.\nHe arrived home broke; he could not immediately afford a mule, so until he could, he hitched a\nplow to his six daughters—there was a seventh but she got smart, married a Yankee and was\npromptly disowned. William Miles never spent a dime; he saved every penny he earned and\nprospered handsomely. He died in 1910. His will instructed his executor to auction off all he had\naccumulated—his house, his equipment, the works—so his net worth could be calculated in hard\ncurrency.\nAll this is captured on his tombstone in the Gum Springs graveyard near Longview. His stone\nrecords the dates of his and his wife Nancy’s births and deaths, and the dates of his service in\nboth the Army of the U.S.A. and the Army of Jefferson Davis. On the back of the stone, for all\nthe world to see, are carved the words “Value of my estate $44,378.34.” That’s nearly $1 million\nin today’s dollars. That’s the good news. He died a rich man. The bad news is that his will\nrequired his daughters to buy everything back that was sold in his estate sale.\nYou cannot tell me that Austin has a corner on the market for being “weird.”\nInteresting as all of that is, I know you didn’t ask me to return tonight to regale you with the\nlegends and lore of my wife’s family. You asked me here to provide insight into something even\nmore resilient and more “weird” than William “Sidestroke” Miles—our economy. So let’s get\ndown to business.\n\n1\n\n\fAs you all know, the Federal Reserve’s principal monetary policymaking group, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC), met last Tuesday and Wednesday. Our statement—released\nlike clockwork at the conclusion of every FOMC meeting precisely at 1:15 p.m. Central time—\nsummed up our collective wisdom: With a host of caveats, we noted that activity in the\nAmerican economy has continued to pick up and appears to be on the mend. Despite this\nprogress, however, we remain vigilant.\nLet me explain why.\nJust this spring, economic conditions were drastically different than they are today. We were\nengaged in battle against an attack that ravaged our economy on four fronts. First: a collapse in\nhome building, the worst we’d seen since the Great Depression. Second: a reversal of wealth—\nthe worst decline in real or nominal terms that we can find in data that begin in 1952. Third: a\nfinancial panic, complete with extreme risk aversion and a credit contraction in securities and\ndirect credit markets. And last but not least: a bank credit crunch.\nA severe contraction had taken root beginning in the fall of 2008, and the Federal Reserve, as the\nmonetary authority of the United States, was duty-bound to do everything within its power to\nmitigate the damage. Our task was no less than to drag the global economy abruptly and\nforcefully from the edge of the abyss.\nI believe we will be judged by history as having done so. Time will tell, of course. But this much\nI know: The policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve, combined with the inherent resiliency\nof the American economy, have helped us reverse the onslaught on three of those four fronts.\nDespite deterioration in nonresidential construction, the housing sector appears to be stabilizing.\nWith regard to wealth, after plunging 24 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from mid 2007\nthrough the first quarter of this year, net worth across all American households rose slightly in\nthe second quarter and will likely be found to have risen in the third. And, after surging to\nincredibly high levels, interest rate spreads have returned to near-normalcy in the commercial\npaper and mortgage markets and are returning to Earth in the bond market.\nEfforts to free up bank credit have helped slow the pace at which banks have tightened their\ncredit standards. The latest reports we have received from bank lending officers, released just\nyesterday, confirm this. However, with the lagging effects of loan quality problems, difficulties\nin the commercial real estate market and uncertainty over regulatory reform, a full resuscitation\nof bank credit has yet to take place and will take considerable time.\nThe progress we’ve made on each of these fronts is most certainly a welcome relief, but\nquestions remain. Where are we headed, and when will we get there?\nAs we closed out the summer, I pointed out in an interview with the Dallas Morning News that\nthere were good reasons to expect fairly strong output growth—what an economist would call\n“above trend growth”—in the second half of this year.1 The reason? I like to call it the “Johnny\nMercer effect,” after the great Hollywood lyricist of the 1940s: Growth follows almost\nautomatically if you “ac-cen-chu-ate the positive and e-lim-i-nate the negative.”2\n1\n2\n\n“Recession Over, Dallas Fed Chief Says, But Jobs Lag,” by Brendan Case, Dallas Morning News, Aug. 26, 2009.\n“Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive,” lyrics by Johnny Mercer and music by Harold Arlen, 1944.\n2\n\n\fThat’s essentially what we saw in the third quarter. Fixed investment flattened out and ceased to\nbe a drag on the economy, eliminating an important negative from the GDP calculus. Consumer\nspending, which was neutral in the first half, became a strong positive. And exports and\ninventory investment did a 180, flipping from sources of weakness to sources of strength.3\nNow, I’ve often thought that economic forecasters seem to be cursed—or maybe blessed, I\nsuppose, dependent upon your point-of-view—with a short-term memory: They tend to\nextrapolate only the most recent trends into the future. As if goosed by the more optimistic tone\nof the latest GDP release, many now believe that solid output growth will extend into the first\nhalf of next year. The latest Blue Chip survey, for example, shows that professional forecasters\nexpect GDP growth averaging 2.8 percent in the first half of 2010.\nI am wary of the consensus view. For a good while now, I’ve suggested that we are more likely\nto see a more uneven recovery—not a “V”-shaped recovery but something more akin to a check\nmark, where the elongated arm of that check mark inclines at a slope that is less than desirable\nand might possibly be repressed by an occasional pause or several quarters of weak growth.\nWhy a check mark?\nSeveral recent sources of strength are likely to wane as we head into next year. Cash-for-clunkers\nand the first-time-homebuyer tax credit have both shifted demand forward, increasing sales today\nat the expense of sales tomorrow. Neither of these programs can be repeated with any real hope\nof achieving anywhere near the same effect: The more demand you steal from the future, the less\nfuture demand there is for you to steal. The general tax cuts and government spending increases\nincluded in this year’s fiscal stimulus package won’t have their peak impact on the level of GDP\nuntil sometime in 2010, but their peak impact on the growth of GDP has come and gone; the\nfiscal stimulus continues to drive GDP upward, compared with what it would otherwise have\nbeen, but the increments to GDP are beginning to shrink. And, as we all know, the shot in the\narm that our economy is receiving from inventory adjustments is, while welcome, inherently\ntransitory.\nWhat about growth in the longer term—the second half of 2010 and beyond? American\nhouseholds have finally come to realize that they’ve been playing the part of the grasshopper in\nAesop’s fable: They see that our previous spending boom was financed by somewhat reckless\ndisregard for tomorrow by over-eager creditors feeding their desire for unsustainable leveraging\nof their income and balance sheets and, for the nation as a whole, by increases in overseas\nborrowing. That reality has been largely absorbed, and consumer spending is growing again—\nalbeit from a lower base and at a slower pace. I doubt it will recover its previous vigor for some\ntime to come. I expect that the strong bounce-back in consumer demand that we’ve come to\nexpect in recoveries past will be absent this time around as Americans recalibrate the proportion\nof their income and wealth that they need to save versus what they need to consume. We need\n\n3\n\nExports did contribute almost 1.5 percentage points to growth in the third quarter, reversing a recent string of four\nconsecutive negative contributions—but net exports remained a drag.\n3\n\n\fnot become a nation as parsimonious as William Miles, but we are going to have to be more antthan grasshopper-like in our behavior.4\nWith a likely subpar showing from household spending, one other candidate as a source of\ngrowth is government spending. We should be hesitant to become overly dependent on it. As\nconsumer credit conditions gradually improve, any boost the economy gets from growth in\ngovernment purchases will increasingly be offset by reductions in household spending—people\nwill save to meet a higher prospective tax burden.\nUnfortunately, this prospect of an uneven and comparatively weak recovery—in combination\nwith excess capacity and uncertainty about the impact of new government initiatives and\nregulation—is taking its toll on business confidence. Firms are hesitant to add plant and\nequipment. In my surveys of corporate CEOs with significant capex wherewithal—a personal\nsurvey I conduct religiously before every FOMC meeting—it appears that those who are\nbeginning to budget expanding plant and equipment are less inclined to do so here at home and\nmore interested in doing so abroad in areas they consider to have greater risk-adjusted profit\npotential.\nMost painfully, they remain hesitant to add labor. I’m sure you all saw the headlines last\nFriday—despite a continuing decline in payroll losses and initial unemployment claims, the\njobless rate in this country has officially reached a 26-year high of 10.2 percent, not counting\nthose who have given up looking for work. Far fewer of you likely saw the latest numbers on\nlabor productivity: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics release last week, nonfarm labor\nproductivity increased at an annualized rate of 9.5 percent in the third quarter. That is the highest\nquarterly increase we’ve seen in six years.\nWhat does this tell us? After a prolonged period of payroll growth, firms are using this downturn\nto reorganize and retool. To control costs and preserve margins that can cushion the top line,\nemployers are learning to do more with less. They are squeezing all the productivity they can\nfrom their employees. You can get a snapshot of this in the recent round of earnings releases by\nthe 453 of the S&P 500 companies that have reported third quarter performance thus far:\nEarnings for these companies were down 10 percent year-over-year. But top-line growth—total\nrevenue growth—was down 14 percent. As long as this condition obtains, companies can hardly\nbe expected to add to payrolls.\nThis is not surprising if you think about it. Before the crisis, we had a long period of economic\nexpansion and easy access to money. Historically, the longer the expansion or period of\nprosperity, the more complacent businesses become. A growing economy, like sailing in a\nfollowing sea and pleasant weather for days on end, weakens the discipline to run a tight ship.\nBut once a storm strikes, captains of industry have no choice but to batten down the hatches and\nreef their sails. The more intense the storm, the longer it takes for the inefficiencies incurred\nduring the previous expansions to recede from memory, even after fair weather returns. I would\nthink that in this recovery period the willingness to rehire or expand capital expenditures will be\n4\n\nOf course, there are alternative versions of Aesop’s fable. In 1924, W. Somerset Maugham wrote a story titled\n“The Ant and the Grasshopper” about two brothers: one a hard worker and a saver and the other not. In the end, the\n“grasshopper” brother marries a rich widow who ups and dies and leaves him a fortune. In the 1988 film Things\nChange, the character played by Don Ameche recites a version where the grasshopper eats the ant.\n4\n\n\flong in coming. Chastised by recent experience, businesses will continue to run tight ships, with\nall resources, including labor, being driven to maximum efficiency.\nIt may be some time before significant job growth occurs and even longer before we see\nmeaningful declines in the unemployment rate.\nSo we have a mixed picture for economic growth down the road, despite the pickup we’ve seen\nlately. What are the implications of all this for monetary policy?\nWith financial-market conditions normalizing—if not yet fully normal—most of the special\nprograms that the Federal Reserve introduced last winter to backstop bank and nonbank credit\nhave either already unwound or are rapidly doing so. For example, the special facility we put in\nplace to revive the commercial paper market when it succumbed to paralysis last year—a facility\nthat expanded our balance sheet by $350 billion at its peak usage level—has fallen to under $10\nbillion as the market has been restored. As to the longer-lived asset purchases we have made,\nnow that mortgage-finance spreads have narrowed, our purchases of mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS) are tapering off. We expect those transactions—which will total up to $1.25 trillion—to\nbe executed by the end of next year’s first quarter.\nA legacy of MBS acquisitions is a Fed balance sheet that has more than doubled in size. This\nexpanded balance sheet has as its counterpart a greatly elevated level of bank reserves. Banks,\nseeking liquidity and avoiding risk, have so far been content to let their reserves sit at the Federal\nReserve, earning a modicum of interest. Ultimately, as confidence returns, these funds will be\nused to support an expansion in bank lending, increasing the velocity of base money in our\neconomy. That would not necessarily be a bad thing, within limits, given all the idle resources in\nthe economy at present. Of course, the Fed must be wary that velocity does not explode and\ncreate inflation pressures resulting from too much money chasing too few goods and services. If\ncredit growth at some point threatens to become excessive, we have the tools to rein it in,\nranging from selling the assets we have acquired so as to suck up excess money, to adjusting the\nrate we pay on excess reserves, to utilizing other techniques such as large-scale reverse\nrepurchase agreements, or “repos,” to even raising the Fed funds rate.\nThe press and the markets are eager to know when we might undertake a tightening in policy.\nThe answer to this question is … “It depends.” Our mandate is to pursue the maximum level of\nemployment consistent with long-term price stability. So, when and how rapidly we reduce our\naccommodative policy must depend on fine judgments about how quickly the real economy gets\nback on track without jeopardizing our longer-run price-stability goal. As noted in our most\nrecent statement, the FOMC will consider a variety of economic indicators—including resource\nslack, inflation trends and inflation expectations—when making this decision. But for the\nforeseeable future, the FOMC considers policy to be appropriately calibrated to the times.\nMy own judgment—based partly on available estimates of slack, but also on the behavior of\nprices, and informed by the anecdotal input I receive monthly from business leaders as to their\nintentions—is that inflation is likely to remain subdued for some time, and thus our current\npolicy is appropriate. Of course, I recognize that our measures of slack and our understanding of\nthe determinants of inflation are uncertain. And agile business leaders can change plans on a\ndime. Being what some believe to be the most hawkish member of the FOMC, I am very\nReagan-esque in my evaluation of inflationary potential: I trust but continually seek to verify that\n5\n\n\finflation is not raising its ugly head. So, as I’ve always done, I will keep a close eye on price\ndevelopments as they unfold.\nRight now, I see more immediate deflationary pressures than inflationary ones. Yet I am fully\naware that the law of unintended consequences is always lurking in the shadows. For instance,\nhaving spent a few years early in my banking career as a foreign exchange advisor to investors\nand corporations, I am particularly mindful of the risks we run by stating in FOMC statements\nthat we expect to maintain the Fed funds rate at “exceptionally low levels” for “an extended\nperiod.” This could fuel the “carry” trade, whereby speculators—assuming U.S. rates will remain\nunchanged over a reasonable time horizon—can borrow plentiful amounts of dollars cheaply and\ninvest them in securities denominated in other currencies that yield more or offer greater returns,\nin the process driving those securities and currencies to prices beyond their equilibrium levels.\nWere this to become a disorderly influence, I would expect the FOMC and other authorities to\ncraft an appropriate remedy.\nTom, here is the bottom line: The Federal Reserve has done what it can to prevent Depression\n2.0 and the deflation that one would have expected might accompany economic collapse. It will\ntake some time, in my opinion, to get back on a steady pathway to a pace of growth that will\nresult in significant job creation. We are in for a long slog. We had a snapback in growth in the\nthird quarter and can expect that will continue in the current quarter. But looking into 2010 and\nperhaps to 2011, the most likely outcome is for growth to be suboptimal, unemployment to\nremain a vexing problem and inflation to remain subdued.\nMind you, you should take economic forecasts—even my own—with a big grain of salt. Jamie\nGalbraith’s dad, John Kenneth Galbraith, may have been more right than econometricians like to\nthink when he said that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look\nrespectable.”\nNobel Prize-winning economist Kenneth Arrow has his own perspective on forecasting. During\nWorld War II, he served as a weather officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps and worked with\nindividuals who were charged with the particularly difficult task of producing month-ahead\nweather forecasts. As Arrow and his team reviewed these predictions, they confirmed\nstatistically what you and I might just as easily have guessed: The Corps’ weather forecasts were\nno more accurate than random rolls of a die.\nUnderstandably, the forecasters asked to be relieved of this seemingly futile duty. Arrow’s\nrecollection of his superiors’ response was priceless:\n“The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them\nfor planning purposes.”\nTom asked me to provide you tonight with my forecast for the economy. This evening, I have\ndone as asked, drawing upon the models and judgment of the Federal Reserve, which are among\nthe most complex and comprehensive in the world. But we cannot lose sight of the unfortunate\nfact that, despite our best efforts, no one can precisely predict the future. While we know where\nthe economy has been and believe we understand the gearing of the economy as well as anybody\ncan, we cannot know with certainty where it’s headed. That said, I hope my musings this evening\nhave been better than “no good” and are of some assistance to you for your planning purposes.\n6\n\n\fThank you for listening. Now, in the tradition that is hallmark of Federal Reserve officials, I\nwould be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\n7\n\n\f"

        "content": "The Role of Globalization in the\nFinancial Crisis and Recovery\nRemarks at the O’Neil Center for Global Markets and Freedom Conference\nSMU Cox School of Business\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nOctober 16, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Role of Globalization in the Financial Crisis and Recovery\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, President [R. Gerald] Turner.\nIt is common for a speaker at SMU to say how honored he is to be introduced by Gerald Turner.\nIn my case, it is especially true. My wife‘s—Nancy‘s—family has been involved in SMU almost\nfrom the time Dallas Hall was the sole building on ―The Hill.‖ Today, I am speaking in a\nbuilding named for my father-in-law, the late, great Jim Collins, Class of ‘37, who turned his\nenergy to serving Dallas in the U.S. Congress after building a business: Fidelity Union Life. That\nbusiness, which was sold to Allianz of Germany in the late 1970s, was the source of the funding\nfor every facility on this campus with the name Collins or Sharp or Altshuler attached to it.\nCountless Collinses and Sharps and even two Fishers have been educated here. I know SMU\nwell, and I knew Jim Collins as well as you could know any man. He would be very proud of\nwhat you have done as president of SMU and would consider you one of the greats, Gerald. And\nI know he would be very pleased to see his son-in-law given such a nice introduction, speaking\nhere in the Crum Auditorium, attached to the building the university so graciously named in his\nhonor. Thank you, Mr. President.\nToday, you are going to hear from people who know firsthand what it means to operate a\nbusiness in a globalized economy—particularly a business located in this unique part of the\ncountry, the global business nexus we call Dallas. Tom [Falk] and Rich [Templeton] are no\nstrangers to the challenges and opportunities that await American businesses in an interconnected\nworld, and I am confident that you all will benefit from their special insight.\nI‘d like to speak more about the context in which global business is conducted, in order to set the\nstage for what I expect Tom and Rich will be saying.\nWe have all read the headlines and listened to the pundits‘ chatter about a looming threat of\n―deglobalization.‖ A slew of armchair analysts, calling to our attention historic declines in world\ntrade and a rise of protectionist instincts, have lamented what they believe to be an impending\nreversal of globalization.\nThis morning, I will argue that a decline in trade flows, at least to some degree, was to be\nexpected during this tumultuous period, the most severe global financial and economic crisis in\ndecades. I will then turn to protectionism, the bête noire of internationally minded business\noperators and policymakers. And then I will conclude with some comments on where we are\nlikely to go from here, making the point that globalization is still very much alive and that, like\nthe music of Wagner, all is not as bad as it sounds.\nAs usual, I will speak only for myself, not for any other member of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Federal Reserve System. Which is fitting, for I will draw not only on my\nperspective as a Federal Reserve policymaker, but also on the four years I spent negotiating trade\nagreements for our country.\n\n1\n\n\fLet‘s begin with what the pundits have right: Our recent economic crisis has led to some truly\nhistoric declines in world trade. According to the International Monetary Fund‘s most recent\nWorld Economic Outlook, global exports of goods and services, by volume, will decline over 11\npercent this year, with exports of advanced economies projected to fare worse than those of their\nemerging and developing peers.1 If you look to the history books, you will learn that, by some\nmeasures, the pace of international trade‘s decline in the first year of this crisis was even greater\nthan what we experienced during the Great Depression.2\nEvidence of the harsh nature of the contraction in trade we have recently experienced can be\nfound in international shipping costs. For years, I have used the Baltic Dry Index, a price index\nthat captures movements in the shipping market for dry bulk commodities, as one indicator of the\nrelative health of international trade flows. In the span of less than seven months, this index took\nan incredible nosedive, plummeting over 94 percent by the early part of December 2008. The\nprice data for leasing ―Capesize‖ vessels—one of the best indicators of shipments of iron ore, a\ncritical ingredient to the key building blocks of infrastructure worldwide—is even more volatile:\nThey reached a peak of nearly $235,000 per day in the summer of 2008 and, since that time,\nhave fallen over 80 percent.3 Data for container ships, the carriers of many consumer durables,\nare similarly bleak, as are the data for the rails that carry goods from the ports to the distribution\npoints of consumer outlets. And, if you‘d read page C1 from today‘s edition of the second-best\nnewspaper in the world, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, you would have seen that Alliance and\nDFW airports—in addition to others, like San Francisco, LAX and JFK—experienced sizable\ncargo business declines last year (although, for DFW, relatively less than its peers).4 While the\nnumbers were not broken out, it is likely that at least some of that downturn could be attributed\nto a decline in goods shipped between international destinations. In the blink of an eye, we went\nfrom shortage-driven inflation in transportation costs to dramatic overcapacity and slack. A little\nover a year and a half ago, daily lease prices of railcars in the United States were escalating\nrapidly; as of Oct. 1 of this year, roughly 178,000 railroad-owned freight cars, which placed end\nto end would total some 2,900 miles, have been laid up in storage for at least five months,\naccording to what Matt Rose, the CEO of BNSF, recently told me. This is something of an\nimprovement from a comparable car count for the previous month of 185,000, but it nonetheless\nprovides a graphic indication of the enormous amount of slack in idle rail assets and the\ncompression that had occurred in final demand for finished goods produced both domestically\nand abroad.\nThe broader, aggregate data speak to the implosion in trade that we have witnessed. As of June\nof this year, our quarterly imports, by volume, had fallen just over 20 percent after peaking in the\nthird quarter of 2007. A similar measure of American exports, by volume, peaked later—as the\n\n1\n\nWorld Economic Outlook: Sustaining the Recovery. International Monetary Fund, October 2009. Data provided by\nHaver Analytics.\n2\nFurther analysis in a pending piece by Mark Wynne at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas cites the work of two\nwell-known economic historians—Barry Eichengreen and Kevin H. O‘Rourke (their analysis can be found at\nhttp://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3421). Starting at the peak in industrial production that preceded each\ndownturn, Eichengreen and O‘Rourke show that the pace of decline in the first year of our current travails bests that\nof the first year of the Great Depression.\n3\nNumbers from Bloomberg.\n4\n―Alliance Cargo Traffic Off 19 Percent in 2008,‖ by Sandra Baker, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Oct. 16, 2009, p.\nC1.\n2\n\n\fcrisis went global in the second quarter of 2008—but still managed to drop roughly 15 percent\nthrough this June.\nThese are just some of the doomsday figures that naysayers have highlighted to portend an\nonslaught of deglobalization. To be sure, these data are quite startling and, indeed, quite historic.\nBut do they portend that deglobalization is taking root? I think not.\nAs most of you know, I am not a trained economist. I earned my bona fides like many of you in\nthis room—in the world of private business, after earning an M.B.A. at Stanford: the SMU of\nCalifornia. That said, I have spent enough time around economists to learn two things:\n1. Number one: Stanley Fischer, my much-revered but spelling-impaired\nnamesake at the Bank of Israel (he insists on inserting a ‗c‘ in Fisher), was\nright when he quipped that there are three kinds of economists: those who can\ncount and those who cannot.\n2. Number three: Simple questions rarely, if ever, have simple answers.\nBefore asserting that ―deglobalization‖ is occurring, we must understand what has driven these\nglobal trade declines and look behind the simple headline figures and ―instant analysis‖—my\nfavorite oxymoron—that accompanies the assertion of the Eeyores of punditry who claim that\nglobalization is at risk.\nLet‘s start by examining how the dramatic trade declines of the past year compare with what we\notherwise might have expected in the midst of a global recession and whether a reversal of\nglobalization, or maybe something else, is to blame. My colleagues at the Dallas Fed‘s\nGlobalization and Monetary Policy Institute—specifically, its director, Mark Wynne, and one of\nits senior economists, Jian Wang—have been doing just that.5 I want to share some of their\npreliminary findings with you.\nFirst, a look to the dictionary: What exactly do we mean by globalization? Let me give you my\nCliffsNotes definition: Globalization is the process by which national borders become\nincreasingly open to international transfers of goods, services, capital, people, ideas and a variety\nother economic inputs and outputs. To businessmen and women, globalization is about managing\nto greater efficiency by driving the costs of goods sold, expenses, inventory sourcing and\nmanagement to optimization. It is also about maximizing market reach and expanding top line\nvolume. For the business operator, globalization is a means to better profits so as to maximize\nreturns to a company‘s stakeholders. You will no doubt hear much about this from Tom and\nRich.\nTo macroeconomists, globalization is about the integration of national markets into one global\nmarket. Fluctuations in the flows of goods and services may certainly be necessary for, or\nsymptomatic of, such integration, but the extent to which any economy can be said to be\nglobalized—the extent to which a domestic economy is integrated with economies elsewhere—is\nbest judged on the basis of how close its domestic prices for various goods and services are to\nthose on world markets.\n\n5\n\nTheir efforts will be published as part of the Dallas Fed‘s Economic Letter series.\n3\n\n\fIn the presence of transportation costs, barriers to trade and so on, we can reasonably expect that\nthere will be a difference between the domestic price of a good and the price that prevails\nglobally. The size of this difference or distortion determines just how much of the good we will\nimport and consume. With the removal of these barriers, that distortion will decline, domestic\nprices will fall and trade will increase.\nIt is possible for trade volumes to increase without an integration of markets. While trade growth\nis necessary for globalization, it is by no means sufficient. A domestic boom, for example, could\nleave us clamoring for all kinds of goods and services, in all price ranges, without driving down\nthose domestic price distortions. The same could happen in reverse: A global recession that\nreduces import demand would likely lead to a decline in trade but might not have any effect on\nthe wedge between domestic and international prices.\nThat, arguably, is largely what took place from last fall through the first half of this year. As the\ncrisis spread from North America to the rest of the globe, the dramatic deterioration in economic\nprospects and the contagious seizure that afflicted financial markets in the advanced economies\nfollowing the failure of Lehman Brothers last September caused the markets for emergingmarket exports to dry up, engulfing them in the global downturn.\nAs policymakers, we would prefer to study price differentials when looking for evidence of\nglobalization. Trade growth, again, is necessary but insufficient. And alternatively, evidence of\ntrade decline is likely necessary, but insufficient, as evidence of that alleged multisyllable\nphenomenon, deglobalization.\nUnfortunately, we lack the reliable global price data needed to perform a more thorough analysis\non that front. As such, we must move forward—cautiously—with our discussion of trade flows.\nIf we posit that deglobalization is not the likely culprit behind the recent historic declines we\nhave witnessed in global trade, we have to ask ourselves what other factors might be at play.\nWith regard to fluctuations in international trade relative to movements in the business cycle,\ntwo facts are worth mentioning. First, exports and imports are, in economists‘ lingo,\n―procyclical.‖ In other words, they move in tandem with GDP. Second, swings in exports and\nimports are far more volatile than those of the business cycle. The average volatility, or standard\ndeviation, of GDP is about 1.7 percent. For exports, that number is over three times greater, at\n5.6 percent, and for imports, 5.2 percent.\nIn short, international trade flows move in the same direction as—and are a lot more volatile\nthan—the overall economy.\nWhy is this the case? Despite innovations that now allow market participants to pass what we\nonce defined as ―nontradable‖ assets across national borders, the composition of international\ntrade is still heavily skewed toward goods. Goods, by value, make up close to 70 and 84 percent\nof our exports and imports, respectively. More important, most of those goods fall into the\ncategory of ―durables.‖ In 2008, for example, more than 60 percent of American traded-goods\ntrade, excluding energy, was classified as durable.\nA durable good can be loosely thought of as anything with a relatively longer lifespan.\nConsumers and producers make use of these products for an extended period. As an economist\n4\n\n\fmight say, they provide utility over time. For a firm, this might include large manufacturing\nequipment. For a household, it might include a car or a refrigerator. Or, in the case of my friend\nand neighbor, Jerry Jones, it might include an 11,500-square-foot, flat-screen television that\nfootballs can reach. Demand for these goods—except for in the case of Jerry, who is a unique\nrisk taker!—is quite volatile. When the economy hits a wall, as it did last year, households\npostpone these larger purchases, and firms rein in previously scheduled capital expenditures.\nThat is what we‘ve seen this year: In the final three months of 2008 and beginning of 2009—\nagain, as the crisis went global—worldwide demand for durable goods fell substantially,\nregistering annualized quarter-over-quarter declines in some developing nations that are well into\nthe double digits. Given the contribution that these goods make to international trade, it should\ncome as less of a surprise that global exports and imports dried up in the midst of the most severe\nglobal recession since World War II.\nThere is another reason we might expect a relatively sharper decline in trade flows during a\nglobal economic downturn—one that is tied to globalization itself. Economists call it ―vertical\nspecialization‖ or ―internationalized production.‖ The other gentlemen you will hear from today\nmight know it simply as doing business in a global world.\nMany goods today are manufactured in more than one place. Firms are no longer beholden to the\nlabor and capital available within their own national borders. They can source various stages of\nproduction from anywhere in the world, using each host nation‘s comparative advantage to drive\ndown costs and expand profit margins. Whereas in previous periods, trade was composed solely\nof finished products, the story is now much more complex. Firms export materials to countries\naround the world and receive finished—or perhaps near-finished—goods that they can then sell\nat home or abroad or ship away for further finishing.\nWhen global demand takes a hit, we don‘t just see a drop-off in the international exchange of\nfinished goods. Intermediate products that multinational firms trade in this globalized production\nprocess fall by the wayside as well. Trade losses are compounded, relative to what they might\nhave been before globalization began.\nAgain, it should come as no surprise, then, that as the global economy declines, trade flows\ndecline even more.\nWhat has come as a surprise, however, is that the magnitude of this decline has been over and\nabove what we might have expected based on our understanding of fundamentals.\nIn the past, econometric models with only two variables—American income and dollar\nstrength—have done reasonably well explaining quarterly fluctuations in our imports. Also, and\nnot surprisingly, models that contain foreign income and dollar strength have typically done well\nexplaining quarterly fluctuations in American exports.\nUntil last fall.\nI am given to reminding the economists at the Dallas Fed that my undergraduate professor, John\nKenneth Galbraith, used to say that economic modeling and forecasting was invented to ―make\nastrology look respectable.‖ So I have asked them to dig deeper into what might have caused this\n5\n\n\fbreakdown. As you may recall, there was no shortage of stories in the financial media last fall\nabout the drying up of trade finance and credit and its detrimental effect on trade flows. Given\nthe nature of the crisis and the abundance of this anecdotal evidence, it is reasonable to assume\nthat a severe reduction of trade finance may well have been the culprit.\nTrade finance is, broadly, every kind of loan, insurance policy or guarantee tied to an\ninternational good or service transaction. It includes a range of tools: from direct credit extended\nby an exporter to government-backed guarantees to letters of credit issued by commercial and\nmultilateral banks and private insurers. Trade finance instruments can even act as pure risk\nhedges, insuring against the myriad potential problems (commercial, political and the like) that\ncan arise in international transactions.\nWhile hard data on trade-specific finance are difficult to obtain, there are a few quantifiable\nmeasures we can point to as evidence of a drying up of this important trade tool. Since the\nsummer of 2007, private capital coming into and out of the U.S. has plunged. In the span of one\nyear, these flows fell from 15 percent of our GDP to zero. Declines in trade credit were similarly\ndramatic. The contraction in trade credit available, for example, to Korean firms in the fourth\nquarter of last year was the most severe since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. And for Brazilian\nfirms, the contraction was more severe than during the real devaluation crisis in the early part of\nthis decade.\nWhen a global flight to quality takes hold—something we‘ve witnessed to a startling degree\nduring this financial crisis—we might expect that investors, banks and firms would limit their\nexposure to relatively risky nations. Surprisingly, though, emerging markets were not the only\nvictims. Firms in the U.S., Japan and Germany, for instance, also saw record drops—literally\nunprecedented at the end of last year—in trade credit liabilities.\nThe subject of trade finance is very much on the front burner in the debate on the need for a new\nregulatory regime governing financial institutions. Had you read page 4 of yesterday‘s Financial\nTimes, you would have seen an intriguing article discussing the accounting treatment of trade\ncredit and an assertion that the ―shortage of trade finance [during the financial crisis] was\nresponsible for more than 10–15 per cent of the fall [in global trade].‖ It went on to say that ―…\nbankers warn that a diminished capacity for trade-related lending could create bottlenecks that\nwill slow or stop the recovery.‖6\nHere is the point: The dramatic turndown in trade we have witnessed was the result not of some\ninvidious plan to undo globalization. It resulted from a turndown in the domestic gearing of the\nworld‘s larger economies, which spread to the emerging economies that feed into demand from\nthose larger economies, and it was exacerbated by the financial crisis, including a clampdown in\ntrade credit.\nThis does not mean globalization is being undone. It does not mean that ―deglobalization‖ has\nbegun.\n\n6\n\n―Regulators Urged to Loosen Credit Restrictions on Banks,‖ by Alan Beattie, Financial Times, Oct. 15, 2009, p.\nA4.\n\n6\n\n\fThat said, we must remain ever vigilant to forces that we know can undo the good that has come\nfrom globalization. The biggest threat of all is the political instinct when times are tough to\nembrace protectionism.\nToday, protectionism is more subtle than in the past. Governments no longer have to resort to\nexplicit tariffs and quotas to stave off the inflow of foreign goods and services. They can be more\ncreative. At the Dallas Fed, we commonly watch indicators released by the World Trade\nOrganization such as antidumping investigations. While these numbers are still well within the\nexperience of the past decade, their increase throughout 2008 and in the first half of 2009 is not\nsomething we can simply ignore.\nOne cannot be too blunt about the dangers of protectionism. It is, quite frankly, the crack cocaine\nof economics: It may provide politicians with a temporary high, yet it is instantly addictive and\ninevitably proves debilitating and fatal for an economy. We must keep a watchful eye on quick\nfixes—like the imposition of tariffs on affordable Chinese tires—to make sure this dangerous\ninstinct does not get out of hand. We cannot forget that what made the Great Depression ―great‖\nor the even worse 23-year ―Long Depression‖ that closed out the 19th century ―long,‖ was the\nonslaught of protectionist measures enacted by a host of countries around the world. We would\nbe well-served to remember that lesson.\nHaving said all that, I must tell you, as a former trade representative, I am encouraged by recent\ndevelopments on the trade front. For example, we hear little these days from Sen. Schumer and\nSen. Graham (or even the Secretary of the Treasury) about the need to take punitive actions in\nretribution for what they consider insufficient flexibility in the exchange rate of the Chinese\ncurrency. While I disagree, from a free-trader‘s perspective, on the Section 421 action taken on\nChinese tires—an action that only hurts lower-income groups in the U.S. who buy those cheaper\ntires—I assume, without any more knowledge than what I learned about the way things operated\nwhen I was a trade representative during the second term of the Clinton administration, that the\ncurrent administration undertook that action as an inexpensive way to placate an important\nconstituency and that there might have been far more expensive alternatives on the table. And I\ntake heart that while Congress has not seen fit to act on the U.S.–Korea Free Trade Agreement—\nan agreement I have long championed—it has at least been agreed to between negotiating parties\nand has occasioned an agreement between Korea and the European Union that was initialed\nyesterday (and modeled in-fact on the Korea–U.S. agreement).\nWhile I doubt the practicability of letting the G-20 or the IMF become global regulatory forums\nor rule-making bodies that trump sovereign authorities of their member nations, I also take heart\nthat at least these forums are being used proactively to discuss common problems and keep the\nmomentum for positive financial reform and continued trade liberalization moving forward. That\nmomentum could have easily gone into reverse under the difficult global financial and economic\nconditions that have obtained.\nThis does not mean that those who believe, as I do, that a more fully interconnected, globalized\neconomy leads to the most efficient allocation of resources (which in turn leads to a more\nproductive, efficient and prosperous environment for American businesses) should let down their\nguard. It does mean that we have cause for optimism. Globalization is proceeding. That‘s the\ngood news. And nobody is in better position to exploit it and make it work to the benefit of their\nstakeholders than Dallas-based businesses.\n7\n\n\fThank you. And now, in the best tradition of central banking, I would be happy to avoid\nanswering any questions you might have.\n\n8\n\n\f"

        "content": "Speech by Richard W. Fisher, President and CEO (2005–2015)\n\nExcerpts from Remarks Before the Texas\nChristian University Business Network of Dallas\nSeptember 29, 2009 Dallas, Texas\nBut, remember the theme here—cautious optimism. While housing is showing some signs of\nhaving reached a bottom, we need to recognize that it is a sector still on life support. The\nFederal Reserve has been buying over 70 percent of the new mortgage originations in the\nMBS market—a process that has lowered mortgage rates and increased the availability of\ncredit at affordable rates to a large swath of the market. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has announced its intention to slow its rate of mortgage acquisitions in\nthe hope that private funding will begin to emerge. And the market for the purchase of new\nhomes has also been helped tremendously by an $8,000 credit for new home buyers.\nOf course, there is some concern that the hope for a housing rebound could succumb to the\nheadwinds experienced earlier if the efforts of fiscal and monetary authorities are allowed\nexpire. Yet, that said, there is, in my opinion, a limit to the life support that can be provided\nby either the Federal Reserve on the monetary front or the Congress on the fiscal front. The\nmarket for housing will not become truly robust until market forces replace the prostheses\nof government support. We have thus indicated to the marketplace that, for our part, the\nFOMC expects we will complete the execution of our $1.25 trillion intervention in the\nmortgage-backed securities market by the end of the first quarter of next year.\n***\nAs to the long-term dangers of inflation posed by the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet, I remain ever vigilant. I have not hesitated in the past to vote against the\nmajority of the FOMC when I felt they were being too accommodative, and I have been\noutspoken on the dangers of prolonged monetary stimulus in the future. Many of the Fed’s\nspecial credit facilities have been winding down at a rapid clip as financial markets have\nbegun to function in a more normal manner. And my colleagues have come to accept the\narguments I made regarding the necessity for the Fed to maintain its independence from the\nTreasury by not increasing its purchases of long-term Treasury securities. As to the Federal\nReserve reducing its balance sheet so as not to monetize the excess reserves waiting to be\nconverted to bank loans, I have been very clear: Given the lag between the time monetary\npolicy is initiated and when it impacts the economy, that wind-down process needs to begin\nas soon as there are convincing signs that economic growth is gaining traction and that the\nlending capacity of the banking system is capable of expansion.\nI am not alone on this front. I have faith my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee will stand and deliver in a timely way. And I expect that when it comes time to\n\n\ftighten monetary policy, my colleagues and I will move with an alacrity that, if needed, will\nbe equal in speed and intensity to that with which we pursued monetary accommodation.\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard W. Fisher served as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from\nApril 2005 until his retirement in March 2015.\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nSeptember 9, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fRemarks Before the 55th Annual Meeting\nof the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Ralph [Babb] for that kind introduction.\nA little over a year ago, the nation was staring straight into the jaws of economic ruin. The\nFederal Reserve stepped into the breach and did what central bankers are called to do: We\nassumed the role of lender of last resort, enacting a sequel to the playbook written by the Bank of\nEngland over 180 years ago following the Panic of 1825. We opened the flood gates and lent\nfreely, instituting unconventional measures to keep the financial lungs of the global economy\nfrom collapsing.\nIn doing so, we took enormous risk with our reputation and with our balance sheet, expanding it\nfrom north of $800 billion before the crisis to $2 trillion today. We knew full well that this would\nlead to a gnashing of teeth about the long-term consequences of our actions, not the least of\nwhich is the potential for all the money we have pumped into the economy to spark an\ninflationary conflagration once its gears start to mesh again.\nI am going to talk to you today, first, about where the economy and inflation now stand and then\nsay a few words about the opportunities that lie before us as Texans as we move on down the\nroad.\nThe long and short of it is that there are presently some signs that the economy is stabilizing and\neven reviving in certain areas, despite mixed signals. Financial markets are continuing to\nimprove; household spending is stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses,\nsluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit; businesses are making progress\nin aligning inventories, though sales are still anemic and CEOs are continuing to cut back on\nfixed investment and payrolls. Given both the monetary accommodation we at the Fed have put\nin place and the stimulus of fiscal policy, it is now reasonable to expect a gradual resumption of\neconomic growth in a context of price stability.\nThe operative words in that sentence were “gradual” and “in a context of price stability.” So, just\nwhat are the prospects for economic growth? And what is the outlook for prices?\nFor the past four years, I have personally surveyed 30 or more chief executives of key companies\nin a broad array of sectors before every Federal Open Market Committee meeting in order to get\na read on how they are positioning their enterprises.\nThese operators of our economy—private-sector operators whose teams decide what to purchase,\nwhat to produce and how many workers are needed to turn inputs into products and sales—are\nstill suffering from shock induced by the trauma of the crisis. I would say they are suffering from\n“post-traumatic slack syndrome.”\n\n1\n\n\fUntil the summer of last year, businesses were emboldened by a prolonged period of ready\nmoney and robust global demand. They were geared toward the expansion of plant, equipment\nand payrolls. At the same time, inflationary pressures were building. Businesses took every\nmeasure possible to boost their top lines by passing on rising costs through higher prices. As we\nentered the summer of 2008, the inflation data exhibited frightful tendencies. Of the 178 items in\nthe consumer’s basket used to measure PCE, 77 percent were rising, and the number rising above\n3 percent per annum was the highest we had seen in nearly two decades.\nThere are limits to the costs that can reasonably be passed on to consumers without damaging\ntop-line revenue performance. Thus, simultaneously, businesses worked like beavers to preserve\ntheir bottom lines by controlling the costs of goods and services they sold, shifting their\nmanagement models and budgeting accordingly.\nThen they experienced a traumatic shock. Demand imploded. The equity and fixed-income\nmarkets seized up. Bank credit evaporated. The growth of the global economy hit a wall.\nWhereas just over a year ago managers were coping with a pervasive scarcity of inputs and\nescalating prices, there is now an abundance of almost every input and output and no pricing\npower. There are too many ships at sea; too many rail cars; too many airplanes and trucks; too\nmany homes; too many hotels and apartments and office buildings; too many retail stores and\nmalls and convenience stores; too much oil, natural gas and corn; and, according to Wall Street\nJournal reports last week, even too much champagne and bottled water.1\nAnd yes, thank you Lord, we have finally come to realize there are too many lawyers.\nIn almost every sector of the economy—save for nonelective medical services and a few basic\ncommodities being hoarded by the Chinese—the CEOs I survey are struggling to cope with\nexcess capacity and slack.\nBusinesses trying to sell products and services feel they are pushing on a string and are adjusting\ntheir behavior accordingly. To maintain sales volumes and clear inventories in the face of\nweakened demand, they are cutting prices. In the fourth quarter of last year, we began to see an\nupward shift in the number of items falling, rather than rising, in price. In the July data recently\nreleased, almost 50 percent of the items in the PCE basket—weighted either by simple count or\nexpenditure—were falling in price. Small wonder that headline inflation was negative over the\nyear ended in June.\nAnd top lines have evaporated. In this most recent quarter, for example, the 376 nonfinancial\ncompanies in the S&P 500 reported a nearly 20 percent decline in top-line revenues. This is the\nthird sales decline in a row—the first time we have seen this since 1965.\nThe new numbers tell me two things. First, for the immediate future, the risk to price stability is\na deflationary risk, not an inflationary one. And second, businesses will continue to run tight\nbudgets as they try to preserve profit margins while operating in the absence of pricing power\nwith the pervasive difficulty of expanding top-line revenues in the face of weak demand. They\n\n1\n\n“Bottled-Water Price War Heats Up as Demand Falls,” Wall Street Journal, Aug. 31, 2009, p. B1, and “As\nChampagne Fizzles, Makers Squash Supply,” Wall Street Journal, Sept. 3, 2009, p. B1.\n2\n\n\fwill continue to focus on cost control, most painfully by shedding workers and driving those who\nremain on the payroll to higher levels of productivity.\nAll of which means that we are likely to see a prolonged period of sluggish economic\nperformance and uncomfortably high unemployment as businesses reallocate capital and labor to\nfit the new economic landscape.\nThe needed reallocation of labor and capital has been, and will continue to be, impeded by\nfinancial markets. Although substantially improved from last fall—due in significant part, I\nwould argue, to the work of the Federal Reserve—markets are still a long way from having\nnormalized. We know from our own experience and from the experience of other countries that\nfinancial headwinds like these take years to abate.\nTo offset those headwinds, fiscal authorities have stepped forcefully into the breach, putting in\nplace a massive stimulus effort. They have done so with the intent of limiting the damage to\ndisposable income from unprecedented declines in wage and salary income—while trying to\ngoose up capital expenditures on infrastructure.\nIf you go back to the rudimentary formula taught in high school economics to account for the\nmakeup of GDP—consumption plus investment plus government expenditures plus net\nexports—the “G,” or government, variable is receiving enormous emphasis, while “C” is flaccid,\n“I” is hesitant and net “X” is tentative. At the present rate, federal, state and local authorities are\nexpected to spend, net of intragovernmental transfers, $5.4 trillion in 2009—just under 40\npercent of expected GDP.\nThe problem is that government stabilization measures come with a real long-term price tag:\nhigher tax rates, greater national indebtedness and the prospect of higher interest rates and the\ndebasement of the dollar driven by the government’s issuance of massive amounts of debt. These\nlong-term costs of a larger government limit the American people’s willingness to rely on the\npublic sector to drive overall economic growth. A fiscal gag reflex ensues, and the public-sector\noption looks less and less attractive as anything other than a temporary source of growth.\nThe major challenge facing U.S. fiscal authorities is meeting the need for near-term economic\nstimulus while pursuing a practicable plan to stabilize the government’s debt-finance obligations.\nThe secretary of the Treasury is doing his level best to reassure investors—both overseas and\nhere at home—that the programs put in place by the Obama administration and the Congress will\nwork their magic and then be gradually withdrawn as the economy gets back into stride. But this\nis no simple task. It is now common knowledge that deficits are growing at $3 million per minute\nand will accumulate to some $9.1 trillion over the next decade. And our fiscal predicament is\ncompounded by the embedded unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare. By our\ncalculation at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the present value of the unfunded debt of\nthese two entitlement programs has reached $104 trillion, with $88.9 trillion of that due to\nMedicare alone.\nThe legendary actor Errol Flynn is reported to have quipped that his problem lay in “reconciling\n[his] gross habits with [his] net income.” I imagine the American public and its representatives\nare close to their limit of tolerance of the “gross habits” of government and the net new\nindebtedness they are willing to pass on to their children, all of which suggests that, as an\n3\n\n\fantidote to what ails the economy, government spending is a thin reed on which to rely. Given\nthe expected slow adjustment rate of the other components of final demand, my guess is it will\nbe a long time before we see growth strong enough and sustained enough to make an appreciable\ndent in excess capacity. I envision an output path going forward from here that looks something\nlike a check mark, with a near-term snapback from the short, intense downstroke we have\nexperienced, followed by a transition to a long period of slower growth corresponding to the\nelongated side of the mark.\nMind you, one of my college professors was John Kenneth Galbraith, who warned his students\nthat “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.” My\nforecast for the economy might be totally wrong. But that is how I see it as a Piscean, and I’m\nsticking with it.\nAs to the long-term dangers of inflation posed by the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet, I remain ever vigilant. I have been outspoken on the reduced need for monetary stimulus\nin the future. Many of the Fed’s special credit facilities have been winding down at a rapid clip\nas financial markets have begun to function in a more normal manner. And I have been\noutspoken on the necessity for the Fed to maintain its independence from the Treasury by not\nincreasing its purchases of long-term Treasury securities. As to the Federal Reserve reducing its\nbalance sheet so as not to monetize the excess reserves waiting to be converted to bank loans to\nthe private sector, I have been very clear: Given the lag between the time monetary policy is\ninitiated and when it impacts the economy, that wind-down process needs to begin as soon as\nthere are convincing signs that economic growth is gaining traction and that the lending capacity\nof the banking system is capable of expansion. Cynics retort that “the Fed may know what to\ndo—but will it have the guts to pull the trigger?” Well, we Texans are not afraid to pull the\ntrigger (as anybody knows who has gone duck hunting with vice presidents of the United\nStates!). I have faith my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will stand and\ndeliver in a timely way.\nRecently, a book titled In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke’s War on the Great Panic written by the\nWall Street Journal’s David Wessel was released. In it, he describes me as one of the “jocks” on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee who is “determined to show [his] manhood by talking\ntough about inflation and economic rectitude.…”2 He’s got that right. I am proud of it. I am paid\nto be a compulsive worrier preoccupied with price stability and monetary integrity, and I aim to\nearn my pay.\nThe Fed does not pay me to promote Dallas and Texas. But I do anyway.\nI am grateful beyond belief that Ray Hunt, who was then chairman of the Dallas Fed board,\nbrought me home from eight years in Washington to be president and CEO of the Dallas Fed. I\nloved being an ambassador; I loved negotiating for my country. But you know what they say.\n“Washington is 10 square miles, surrounded by reality; Washington is Hollywood for ugly\npeople; Washington is a place where a friend is someone who stabs you in the chest.” These are\nexaggerations. But I do feel blessed to be able to work on national policy at this amazing\njuncture in economic history with the brilliant staff of the Dallas Fed and live among genuine\n2\n\nIn Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke’s War on the Great Panic, by David Wessel, New York, N.Y.: Crown Business,\n2009, p. 124.\n4\n\n\fpeople who are hard headed, pro-business, unafraid of competition, no-nonsense and hardly\nenamored with the heavy hand of government. They give me the perspective and moral support I\nneed to make the arguments I do at that big mahogany table where the Federal Open Market\nCommittee meets.\nIt is a great source of pride to me that in 2007, Texas created almost 30 percent of all the private\nsector jobs in the nation. I delight in the fact that my Federal Reserve District was the only one in\nthe country that created jobs in 2008. Imagine that: While the nation lost over 3 million jobs in\n2008 as the peanut butter hit the fan, we managed to create 63,100 jobs in Texas.\nIt is true that our job-creating machine rolled over in the early fall, and we entered a recession\nlike the rest of the country. And yes, my staff projects that we will have up to 212,000 jobs lost\nin Texas this year. That hurts: Roughly one of every 50 people in this room has already lost or\nwill lose his or her job this year. My expectation, however, is that the cut is going to be less deep\nhere and require fewer stitches than elsewhere. I expect that we will come out of the recession\nchute not only quicker but stronger than many other parts of the country.\nWhy? Because we have the right stuff. If you didn’t see it, you should read and re-read the\nEconomist magazine’s cover article and special section on Texas in the July 11 issue—this little\nbaby right here. It cites many things that are music to my ears. For example, it points out that\nChief Executive magazine ranks Texas as the best state in which to conduct business. It goes on\nto say that Texas, and I quote, “has coped well with the recession, with an unemployment rate\ntwo points below the national average and one of the lowest rates of housing repossession …\n[and its] banks … did not overexpand...” (no doubt due to great regulatory oversight by the\nDallas Fed!). Texas, it concludes, “offers a different model [than the rest of the states], based on\nsmall government … no state capital-gains or income tax, and a business-friendly and\nimmigrant-tolerant attitude.”3\nThe magazine is balanced; it also points out our weaknesses—primarily a lack of Tier 1\nuniversities and the potential for a repetition of California’s woes as the demography of our state\nchanges. But it makes a clear argument that Texas has the potential to be the crucible of the\nfuture of the United States.\nThis wasn’t written by the governor’s economic development office. It was written by unbiased\nparties in one of the most respected journals in the world. I suggest to this chamber that they take\nthis and every piece of propaganda we can garner and immediately put it in the hands of every\nCEO and leading academic in the country—in Michigan (where Ralph and Comerica moved\nfrom) and in California and New York and every other place that has run aground on the shoals\nof the Great Recession—and proactively go out and incent them to pull up their stakes wherever\nthey are and replant them in this great city and state. We need to strike now and press our\ncomparative advantage to secure the future prosperity of our children and their children and their\nchildren after that.\nYou ought to pursue this mission with the same kind of enthusiasm and vigor you always have in\nfulfilling your mission here in the North Dallas Chamber. What you have done with this group\n3\n\n“America’s Future,” The Economist, July 11, 2009, p. 13.\n5\n\n\fand all your other efforts for the greater Dallas area have made and continue to make a huge\ndifference.\nI consider chambers of commerce to be the Marine Corps of the economic community of any\ncity.\nYou remember what Ronald Reagan said about the Marines: “Some people spend an entire\nlifetime wondering if they have made a difference. The Marines don’t have that problem.”\nDallasites don’t have that problem. Texans don’t have that problem. If we can just harness the\nspirit and devotion that is in this room and spread it city- and statewide, our future will never be\nin doubt and we will, indeed, inspire the nation.\nThanks for listening. Now, in the best tradition of the Federal Reserve, I’ll do my best to avoid\nanswering your questions.\n\n6\n\n\f"

        "content": "Post-Traumatic Slack Syndrome\nand the Economic Outlook\n(With Thanks to Finn Kydland, Dolly Parton\nand John Kenneth Galbraith)\nRemarks at the Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance,\nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSanta Barbara, California\nSeptember 3, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fPost-Traumatic Slack Syndrome and the Economic Outlook\n(With Thanks to Finn Kydland, Dolly Parton and John Kenneth Galbraith)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Professor [Peter] Rupert. I am grateful to you and especially to our mutual friend,\nFinn Kydland, for inviting me to speak at this magnificent university tonight under the auspices\nof the Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance.\nIf I may, before starting my speech, I would like to say a few words about Finn. I am half\nNorwegian: My mother descends from the seafaring Andersen clan of Sandefjord, a former\nwhaling town roughly 400 kilometers east of the farmlands of Jaeren, where Finn was born. You\ncan’t have a trace of Norwegian blood and not be proud of Finn. Only 11 Norwegians have ever\nwon a Nobel Prize, and only six have done so in my lifetime. Three of those were prizes in\neconomics.\nWhich brings to mind the old saw that there are three kinds of economists—those who can count\nand those who can’t.\nFinn can count. And reason clearly. And teach, patiently and lucidly. He has been of great help\nto us at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in improving our understanding of time\ninconsistency and the business cycle. And he honors us by serving on the advisory board of the\nDallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. I am most thankful to Finn for his\ncontributions to economics, to the Federal Reserve and to Norwegian pride.\nNow to the subject at hand.\nAs Professor Rupert mentioned, my wife Nancy and I are bibliophiles. We collect rare books.\nThis is an expensive hobby that began when I wrote a paper as a student at Stanford’s Graduate\nSchool of Business on the imperfect auction market for out-of-print first editions. As you might\nguess, the recent financial crisis has ratified much of what I wrote about over 30 years ago, and\nthat, as Peter mentioned, is what enabled my recent bargain-priced purchase of the original\nOxford English Dictionary and a near-mint-condition 1841 printing of Mackay’s Memoirs of\nExtraordinary Popular Delusions, a book I recommend to anybody who wants to understand the\npathology behind the recent—and any other—financial crisis.\nOur interest in books led us to serve on a committee that advises the Library of Congress. It was\nthrough the library that we were introduced to the country singer Dolly Parton. Most people\nthink of Dolly as the caricature of Marx’s—Groucho’s, not Karl’s—swarmy quip: ―She has eyes\nthat folks adore so, and a torso even more so.‖ But Ms. Parton has a prodigious brain for music\nand business—and a passion for books. She has done a great deal for education—her foundation\nnow gives out, free of charge, over 6 million books a year to pre-K children in more than 40\nstates, the District of Columbia, Canada and the United Kingdom to start them on the road to\nreading.\nWhat does this have to do with the economy? Well, in thinking about what I wanted to say\ntonight, I was reminded about an incident that occurred when Ms. Parton was given the Library\nof Congress’ Living Legend medal for her contributions to American culture. At dinner\n1\n\n\fafterward, a rather indignant woman, offended by Ms. Parton’s … topography, thought to\ndiminish her by noting how disproportionately small her feet seemed to be. Dolly’s saucy riposte\nwas a classic: ―Well, you know, sweetie, it is very hard to grow anything in the shade.‖\nTonight, I wish to speak of the difficulty of growing our economy in the shade of an abundance\nof excess capacity for the production of goods and services worldwide.\nThe Present Situation\nYou will have read in this morning’s newspapers of the minutes released yesterday of the\nFederal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting of Aug. 11–12 and the conclusions drawn at\nthat meeting regarding the status of the economy. The collective sense of our group was that the\neconomy was leveling out. We noted that conditions in financial markets were continuing to\nimprove; household spending was stabilizing but remained constrained by ongoing job losses,\nsluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit; and businesses were making\nprogress in aligning inventories with still-anemic sales and were continuing to cut back on fixed\ninvestment and payrolls. The committee concluded, given both the monetary accommodation we\nhad put in place and fiscal policy, that it was reasonable to expect a gradual resumption of\neconomic growth in a context of price stability.\nThe operative words in that sentence were ―gradual‖ and ―in a context of price stability.‖ Just\nwhat are the prospects for economic growth? And what is the outlook for prices?\nIn explaining how the economy will transition from recession to recovery, we at the Dallas Fed\nhave been referring lately to ―the Johnny Mercer effect,‖ after the Hollywood lyricist who\npenned the refrain ―Ac-cent-chuate the positive [and] e-lim-i-nate the negative.‖\nHere is how it works. Residential investment, inventory investment and consumer spending\ntogether account for 3 percentage points of the 3.9-percentage-point decline in real gross\ndomestic product (GDP) that we’ve seen over the past four quarters. So, if we eliminate these\nnegatives, we go a long way toward stabilizing the economy.\nThe latest monthly indicators suggest that the drag from residential investment has stopped.\nIndeed, our latest estimate is that residential investment will add roughly half of 1 percentage\npoint to GDP growth in the current quarter. Inventory investment is likely to remain negative,\nbut as long as it does not become even more negative, it will cease to be a drag on GDP growth.\nAnd if the pace of inventory liquidation moderates, you eliminate a powerful negative and begin\nto accentuate the positive.\nConsumption, the most prominent of all GDP components, has suffered its biggest four-quarter\ndrop since 1951.1 But, as Milton Friedman taught us, households adjust their spending levels\nquickly as the economic outlook changes, without waiting for the changes to be realized. In other\nwords, they cut their spending as job prospects deteriorate rather than wait for layoffs to actually\noccur. This means that the worst may well be over for household consumption, barring some\nnew shock. We certainly do not expect American consumers to come surging back to fuel a\nglobal boom any time soon, but the latest data on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and\nretail sales are broadly consistent with Friedman’s theory. Real household spending rose for the\nthird month in a row in July and is up 0.6 percent (not annualized) so far this year, though some\nof this growth undoubtedly reflects the cash-for-clunkers program, which has now expired.\n\n2\n\n\fIn a similar vein, the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management shows export orders\nswinging into positive territory as the economies of our overseas trading partners begin to turn\naround. Again, we have a reversal of signs and the elimination of a negative: Falling exports\nsubtracted 1.9 percentage points from GDP growth over the past four quarters. Nonresidential\nfixed investment has been an even larger drag on the economy, subtracting 2.4 percentage points\nfrom GDP growth. But, as with consumption, the latest monthly indicators suggest a bottoming\nout and hint at the beginnings of a modest expansion.\nMeanwhile, government stimulus spending is kicking into gear, accentuating a positive:\nGovernment purchases added 1.3 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, up almost 1\npercentage point from the average of the previous three quarters.\nThe point is: A lot of former negatives are being eliminated or even turned into positives. Former\npositives, like government purchases, are being accentuated. The combination is beginning to\npropel the economy upward.\nThe question is: How robust and sustainable will the recovery be?\nInventory adjustments, while welcome, are of temporary utility. Any boost to growth we receive\nas firms achieve control of their inventories will be the result of a rebalancing of supply and\ndemand that is inherently transitory. Sustained growth will have to come from somewhere else.\nI doubt it will come from housing or a return to the bad old days of financial Bacchanalia. We do\nnot want—and cannot expect—massive foreign capital inflows or domestic investment\nindifferent to risk to finance another boom in household spending and residential investment.\nThat means we will need to see a massive reallocation of capital and labor away from such\nformerly hot growth areas as construction and finance. This reallocation will be impeded by\nfinancial markets that—while improving—continue to operate at less-than-full efficiency. I\nsurmise that the re-gearing will take time and that, in the interim, households and businesses will\nfocus on shoring up their savings and balance sheets rather than spending money. For\nconsumption, that translates into a slow crawl out of purgatory. For capital expenditures and\nemployment rolls, it means an emphasis on tight budgeting and a continued focus on absolute\nneeds rather than wants.\nFor the past four years, I have personally surveyed 30 or more chief executives of key companies\nin a broad array of sectors before every Federal Open Market Committee meeting to get a read\non how they are positioning their enterprises.\nThese operators of our economy—private-sector operators whose teams decide what to purchase,\nwhat to produce and how many workers are needed to turn inputs into products and sales—are\nstill suffering from shock induced by the trauma of the crisis. I would say they are suffering from\n―post-traumatic slack syndrome.‖\nUntil the summer of last year, businesses were emboldened by a prolonged period of ready\nmoney and robust global demand.

Given\nthe expected slow adjustment rate of the other components of final demand, my guess is it will\nbe a long time before we see growth strong enough and sustained enough to make an appreciable\ndent in excess capacity. I envision an output path going forward from here that looks something\nlike a check mark, with the Johnny Mercer effect giving us a near-term snapback from the short,\nintense downstroke, followed by a transition to a long period of slower growth corresponding to\nthe elongated side of the mark.\nNow, mind you, this is what I foresee from my vantage point, standing before you tonight. Yet\nwell before I met Finn Kydland or could afford to collect rare books, or was taught economics by\nDolly Parton, I took an undergraduate course from John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith warned his\nstudents that ―[T]he only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look\nrespectable.‖ My forecast for the economy might be totally wrong. But that is how I see it as a\nPiscean, and I’m sticking with it.\n5\n\n\fPeter, thank you. I would now be happy to avoid answering any questions the audience might\nhave.\nNotes\n1\n\nConsumption surged after the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 because people feared a return to World\nWar II-style rationing.

Fisher\nIn his upcoming book, In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke’s War on the Great Panic, David Wessel\nof the Wall Street Journal writes that ―Fed officials are the Jewish mothers of the global\neconomy. They always have to worry about something …‖1 He also organizes the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) into ―cool guys,‖ ―jocks,‖ ―geeks‖ and ―wannabes.‖ I am classified\nas one of the ―jocks‖ who, according to Wessel, are ―determined to show their manhood by\ntalking tough about inflation and economic rectitude.‖2 So this morning, you are going to hear\nfrom a compulsive worrier preoccupied with price stability and monetary integrity.\nIf you had turned to page 2 of the Wall Street Journal on Monday, you would have seen a\nfelicitous headline that read, ―Fed‘s Lending Ebbs as Crisis Subsides.‖ The leading indicators for\nJune that were released on Monday by the Conference Board do, indeed, hint at a crisis\nsubsiding: The index rose for the third straight month and, in doing so, has registered gains\ncomparable to those seen last in the economic recoveries of 1991 and 2001–02. The index\nreflected recent increases in residential building permits, a modest increase in the manufacturing\nworkweek, a retreat in initial jobless claims and slight improvement in supplier deliveries. Taken\ntogether with other, recent economic data releases, these movements might be viewed as\nsignaling improving conditions in manufacturing and distribution. As to the Fed‘s lending, had\nyou suffered through my last few speeches, you would have heard me say that the Federal\nReserve had pulled the economy back from the abyss as I reviewed the success of the temporary\nprograms we put in place to revive the functioning of the key credit markets.3\nThe Journal is right: Our lending from these facilities has ebbed. To update you: At last count,\nour holdings of commercial paper had been reduced from $350 billion at its peak to $111 billion;\nthe primary dealer credit facility has gone untapped for 10 weeks; overseas central bank\nborrowing under the swap arrangements we put together at the end of 2007 and significantly\nexpanded afterward is running at a fifth of its peak rate. The term asset-backed securities loan\nfacility, or TALF (which some wags said was too clever by HALF), is still growing but\ncomprises a very small proportion of the Fed‘s emergency lending portfolio. And the term\nauction facility, or TAF—the very first facility we created in December of 2007 to auction\nsignificant amounts of discount window credit to primary-credit-eligible depository\ninstitutions—is running an average daily balance that is almost half the rate it reached during the\nfourth quarter of 2008.\nSo what‘s to worry about?\nWell, central bankers always find things to worry over—we are genetically programmed that\nway. Today I‘ll speak of two concerns. The first is the longer-term outlook for the economy. The\nsecond has to do with the separate but related problem of the concentration of financial power in\nthe hands of too few institutions and the pathology of too-big-to-fail.\n1\n\n\fThe Economic Outlook\nThe outlook for real activity over the next several quarters is improving. While there is\nconsiderable angst regarding the problem of growing unemployment, which in the troughs of the\nlast two recessions was a painful and politically evocative lagging indicator, there are clear signs\nthat the economy is stabilizing and even reviving in critical areas. The mathematics of\nstabilization is interesting. One of my colleagues at the Dallas Fed calls it ―the Johnny Mercer\neffect,‖ after the famous Hollywood lyricist who penned the refrain ―Ac-cent-tchu-ate the\npositive [and] e-lim-i-nate the negative.‖\nHere is how it works. Residential investment, inventory investment and consumer spending each\nsubtracted more than a percentage point from GDP growth, on average, during the fourth quarter\nof 2008 and first quarter of 2009 (the latest periods for which we have data). The latest monthly\nindicators suggest that the drag from residential investment has stopped and may even be\nreversing. Inventory investment is likely to remain negative, but as long as it does not become\nmore negative, it will cease to be a drag on GDP growth. And if the pace of inventory liquidation\nmoderates, you eliminate a powerful negative and begin to accentuate the positive.\nAs to consumption, the most prominent of all GDP components: With the exception of the\nepisode in the spring of 1980 when President Carter imposed credit controls, consumption has\nsuffered its biggest two-quarter drop since records began in 1947. But, as Milton Friedman\ntaught us, households adjust the level of their spending quickly as the economic outlook changes,\nwithout waiting for the changes to be realized. In other words, they cut their spending as job\nprospects deteriorate rather than wait for layoffs to actually occur. This means that the worst may\nwell be over for household consumption, barring new bad news. While we do not expect\nAmerican consumers to come surging back to fuel a global boom any time soon, latest data on\npersonal consumption expenditures and retail sales appear consistent with Friedman‘s theory.\nIn a similar vein, the latest reports from the Institute for Supply Management show export orders\nstabilizing as the economies of our overseas trading partners begin to bottom out. Again, we\nhave a reversal of signs and mitigation—if not elimination—of the negative: Falling exports\nsubtracted 3.8 percentage points from GDP growth over fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter\n2009. Nonresidential fixed investment was nearly as large a drag: 3.6 percentage points. But, as\nwith residential investment, the latest monthly indicators suggest at least a bottoming out and,\nhopefully, even the beginnings of a rebound.\nMeanwhile, government stimulus spending is about to kick in, turning a 0.2-percentage-point\ndrag on GDP growth into a significant plus.\nA lot of former negatives are being eliminated. We are seeing changes from negative impulses to\nslightly positive ones. This accentuates the positive in the aggregate. We probably have the\nbeginnings of a faint recovery.\nHow robust and sustainable will the recovery be? There‘s the rub—the stuff of concern.\nInventory adjustments, while welcome, are of temporary utility. Any boost to growth from\ninventory investment will be the result of a rebalancing of supply and demand that is inherently\ntransitory. Sustained growth will have to come from somewhere else.\n2\n\n\fI doubt it will come from housing or a return to the bad old days of financial Bacchanalia. We do\nnot want—and cannot expect—massive foreign capital inflows or domestic investment\nindifferent to risk to finance another boom in household spending and residential investment.\nThat means we will need to see a massive reallocation of capital and labor away from such\nformerly hot growth areas as construction and finance. I surmise that this regearing will take time\nand that, in the interim, households and businesses will focus on shoring up their savings and\nbalance sheets rather than spending money. For consumption, that translates into a slow crawl\nout of purgatory. For capital expenditures and employment rolls, it means an emphasis on tight\nbudgeting and continued focus on absolute needs rather than wants.\nThe needed reallocation of labor and capital has been and will continue to be impeded by\nfinancial markets. Although substantially improved from last fall—due in significant part, I\nwould argue, to the work of the Federal Reserve—markets are still a long way from having\nnormalized. We know from our own experience and from the experience of other countries that\nfinancial headwinds like these take years to abate.\nTo offset those headwinds, the fiscal authorities have stepped forcefully into the breach, putting\nin place a massive stimulus effort. They have done so to prevent unprecedented year-over-year\ndeclines in wage and salary income from translating into falling disposable income—while\nsimultaneously trying to goose up capital expenditures on infrastructure.\nIf you go back to the rudimentary formula taught in high school economics to account for the\nmakeup of GDP—consumption plus investment plus government expenditures plus net\nexports—the ―G,‖ or government, variable is receiving enormous emphasis while ―C‖ is flaccid,\n―I‖ is hesitant and net ―X‖ is tentative. At the present rate of government expenditures thus far\nthis year, federal, state and local authorities—net of intragovernmental transfers—are expected\nto spend $5.6 trillion in 2009, equivalent to 40 percent of expected GDP.\nThe problem is that government stabilization measures almost certainly come with a real longterm price tag: higher tax rates, greater collective indebtedness and the prospect of higher interest\nrates driven by the government‘s issuance of debt. These long-term costs of a larger government\nput a limit on the American people‘s willingness to rely on the public sector to drive growth in\nthe overall economy. A fiscal gag reflex ensues, and the public-sector option looks less and less\nattractive as anything other than a temporary source of growth.\nThe major challenge facing U.S. fiscal authorities is meeting the need for near-term economic\nstimulus while simultaneously pursuing a practicable plan to stabilize the government‘s debtfinance obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is doing his level best to reassure investors—\nboth overseas and here at home—that the programs put in place by the Obama administration\nwill work their magic and then be gradually withdrawn as the economy gets back into stride. He\nwill, incidentally, have to square his corners with the Congressional Budget Office, which\nestimates that annual deficits will stay above at least $600 billion a year over the next decade and\nwill require an addition of $9.1 trillion in debt.\nErrol Flynn is reported to have quipped that his problem lay in ―reconciling [his] gross habits\nwith [his] net income.‖ I imagine the American public and its representatives are close to their\nlimit of tolerance of the gross ―habits‖ of government and the net new indebtedness they are\n3\n\n\fwilling to pass on to their children, all of which means to me that reliance on government\nspending as an antidote to what ails the economy is a thin reed to rest on. Given the expected\nslow adjustment rate of the other variables that make for sustainable economic growth, my guess\nis it will be a long time until we reach a point when that growth will carry on at rates to which we\nhad become accustomed. I envision an economic path forward from here that looks something\nlike a check mark, with the Johnny Mercer effect giving us a snap back as the negative\nmomentum of the short, intense down stroke of the check mark abates and turns upward but then\nsettles into a lower growth slope on the elongated side of the mark.\nMind you, one of my professors at Harvard was John Kenneth Galbraith, who warned us that\n―economic forecasting was created to make astrology look respectable.‖ I might be totally wrong\nhere. But that is how I see it presently from my perch at the Dallas Fed: Economic growth is\nlikely to be slower in the out years than we have become accustomed to.\nThe challenge for the Federal Reserve is to provide needed near-term monetary stimulus while\nmaintaining a credible commitment to long-term price stability. This means (a) distinctly\navoiding any perception that we are willing to monetize this or any other administration‘s fiscal\ninitiatives, and (b) providing the marketplace with a clear sense of how we will unwind in a\ntimely manner the stop-gap measures that have resulted in a dramatic expansion of our balance\nsheet.\nI want to return to the chart on page 2 of Monday‘s Wall Street Journal. While the temporary\nliquidity programs I mentioned earlier have retracted, our balance sheet has expanded due to the\nincrease in our holdings of securities held outright. Here are the numbers for the past year\nthrough last week: The Fed has taken onto its consolidated balance sheet $205 billion in\nTreasury securities, $102 billion in the debt of Federal agencies and $526 billion in mortgagebacked securities. We presently carry a total of $1.3 trillion in securities held outright,\naccounting for roughly 63 percent of our total assets.4 When the Fed acquires securities, the\nfunds enter the banking system and ultimately appear in the reserve accounts held at the Fed by\nbanks and other financial institutions. When these reserves are removed from our balance sheet\nand lent out to the public, expansion in the money supply and easier credit conditions could\nultimately result in inflationary pressures. Mindful of this, concerned parties have asked what our\n―exit strategy‖ will be.\nChairman Bernanke provided what I thought was a fulsome exposition of our exit arsenal in his\nsemiannual Humphrey–Hawkins testimony (the CliffsNotes version of his presentation was\nmade available in an op-ed in the Journal on Tuesday).5 He detailed the means by which the\nFOMC can either directly reduce the stock of reserves or temper the incentive for banks to\ndeploy them into the economy by making it attractive for banks to keep them on deposit at the\nFed through higher interest rate payments. We could also drain reserves and excess liquidity by\narranging large-scale reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos), have the Treasury sell bills\nto the public to sop up money in the system and place the proceeds on deposit at the Fed and, if\nnecessary, sell outright into the market some of the longer-term securities we hold on the left\nside of our balance sheet.\nI will say no more about this here today; I think the chairman has covered the waterfront on this\nsubject. But I will acknowledge that, yes, to pull the credit markets out of a death spiral, we have\ntaken great risk with the Federal Reserve balance sheet. We never contemplated doing more than\n4\n\n\fthe minimum necessary. And we know that we can do too much. For example, while one can\nargue that by agreeing to purchase up to $300 billion in long-term U.S. Treasuries, the FOMC\nprovided a needed short-term tonic to private credit markets, we dare not come to be viewed as a\nhandmaiden to the Treasury. By loosening the anchor we have established for long-term inflation\nexpectations, we could create the perception that monetary policy is subject to political\nimperatives, doing lasting damage to our ability to maintain price stability and restore full\nemployment. I believe we have come as close as we dare to the line between acceptable and\nunacceptable risk in this regard, and do not personally wish for us to expand or extend our\npurchases of Treasuries beyond the cumulative $300 billion planned by this fall.\nTo conclude this little diversion on exit strategy, let me say that I am aware some will argue that\nlaying out our arsenal is not enough; we need to convince markets we have the nerve to deploy it\nin a timely fashion. Within minutes of the conclusion of the chairman‘s testimony, one\ncommentator sent out a client note, later echoed by many others on op-ed pages and on the web,\nas follows: We now ―know the Fed has the bullets, but fear it will not have the guts to pull the\ntrigger.‖ To a Texan who lives in a gun culture, this is a cute analogy (especially coming from\nsomeone who‘s Swiss!). But I would not doubt our resolve. We know full well that monetary\npolicy trickles in with a lag and that we will have to ―pull the trigger‖ of tightening policy well\nbefore it is politically convenient.\nToo Big to Fail\nFiscal and monetary authorities today face the additional, special challenge of reforming\nfinancial regulation so as to minimize the chances of a future meltdown. Here, again, there is a\ntension between the short term and the long term. In the short term, once a financial crisis has\nbegun to develop, the natural focus is on limiting the damage—on preventing contagion. A real\ndanger is that in the longer term, the prospect of these government damage-control efforts will\nlead financial institutions to take inappropriate risks, making the financial sector even more\ndysfunctional.\nThe financial crisis has had some important consequences for the structure of the banking\nindustry—indeed, the financial industry as a whole. We saw the investment banking model\nlargely disappear as some of the major players—Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley—\nconverted to bank holding companies, while some others—Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and\nLehman Brothers—are no longer with us. The restructurings that have taken place have certainly\naltered the shape of the U.S. banking industry.\nA major concern of mine is that all the crisis-related acquisitions we have seen may further\nconsolidate financial assets and power into the hands of a few large organizations, leading\nultimately to reduced competition and a less diverse and efficient financial sector. The massive\ngovernment assistance recently provided to large banks may be artificially tilting the competitive\nbalance in favor of large institutions.\nFor example, each of the four largest commercial banking organizations, and others as well, was\nprovided with substantial government assistance during the crisis—all, at least implicitly, in the\nname of the too-big-to-fail doctrine. As a group, the total asset base of the four has grown 30\npercent since June 2007.6 In contrast, industry assets outside the four have grown a smaller 12\npercent.\n5\n\n\fThat growth reflects acquisitions. Bank of America‘s assets grew 51 percent from June 2007 to\nMarch 2009, assisted in no small part by its acquisitions of Countrywide Financial and Merrill.\nWells Fargo‘s asset base grew 138 percent, thanks mainly to its acquisition of Wachovia. J.P.\nMorgan Chase acquired both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual and grew 43 percent.\nThe only institution among the top four that did not grow is Citigroup, whose assets declined\nalmost 20 percent. And here‘s an interesting observation: Rough estimates suggest the top four\ninstitutions together would have shrunk—not just Citigroup—if not for the acquisitions just\nmentioned. Taking out the acquired assets, the current top four likely would have shrunk 7\npercent as a group over the period in question.\nThe acquisitions of troubled banks have worked to perpetuate size concentration in the banking\nindustry. The top four currently control 44 percent of industry assets. If we simply take away\nfrom the top four the assets they recently acquired, they would have ―only‖ 30 percent of the\nindustry‘s asset base.\nIn using acquisitions to resolve the crisis, we may have unwittingly perpetuated one of its root\ncauses—the too-big-to-fail doctrine.\nThoughtful critics will point out that too-big-to-fail is economically perverse: There is something\ninherently anticapitalistic when you have a system that allows banks, their shareholders and\ncreditors to profit when things go well but leaves the taxpayer holding the bag when things turn\nsour.\nThe economist Allan Meltzer likes to say that ―capitalism without failure is like religion without\nsin: It doesn‘t work.‖ In order to have a financial system that remains the fountainhead of credit\nand the wherewithal for business men and women to bring forth new ideas and products and\ncreate employment, we must have a dynamic system that rewards winners rather than coddles\nlosers, that incentivizes prudent behavior and harshly penalizes imprudent behavior.\nMy colleague Gary Stern—the outgoing president of the Minneapolis Fed who literally wrote the\nbook on TBTF (too big to fail)—recently gave a speech that pulled no punches on this front. He\nsaid (a) ―it is striking that most of the losses suffered to date during the financial crisis have been\nat the largest institutions operating in the country,‖ (b) the problem of too-big-to-fail was ―not …\naddressed effectively by the FDICIA legislation of 1991 [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act]‖ and (c) ―creditors of such [large] complex financial institutions expected, on\nthe basis of relatively well-established precedents and on an understanding of policymakers‘\nmotivations, protection if failure threatened.‖7 Thus incentivized, management of these\ninstitutions took excessive risk, and the market underpriced that risk. And it follows in President\nStern‘s mind, as it does in mine, that unless incentives are focused upon in seeking to cure the\nproblem of TBTF, we will not only fail to address this most troublesome pathology but may\nmake it worse.\nStern argues that the Treasury proposal now on the table to correct the problem ―fails‖ in regard\nto corralling incentives for managers of large institutions to repeat the errors for which the public\nhas recently paid so dearly. Here is his punch line: ―I would describe the Treasury plan … as\n‗status quo plus‘—[with] more capital, more liquidity, better supervision, [and] far-reaching\nresolution authority for the largest institutions. [But] [t]here is little reason to think that these\n6\n\n\fsteps will … succeed in reining in TBTF effectively over time because they do not change the\nincentives which create the problem. In fact,‘‘ Stern concludes, ―there is nothing in the Treasury\nproposal designed to put creditors of large, systemically important financial institutions at risk of\nloss. … [T]he Treasury proposal … leaves the financial system considerably more vulnerable\n…‖8\nAs we grapple with TBTF and with the overall regulatory treatment of so-called Tier 1\ninstitutions, we are going to have to bear Gary Stern‘s criticism in mind. The only way to ensure\na robust financial system is to enforce a system that marries risk-taking to consequences and see\nto it that the consequences for mismanagement are loss of managerial positions and the capital of\nshareholders and creditors, including uninsured depositors, rather than a second chance that only\nfurther concentrates financial power.\nThis is important—not only to ensure a more efficient economic system but to better facilitate\nthe implementation of monetary policy. The extent and duration of the extraordinary steps taken\nby those of us at the Fed are complicated by the prolonged existence of financial institutions that\nfall into this troublesome category.\nBanks that are too big to fail exacerbate business and credit cycles. In the good times, these\ninstitutions use excessive leverage and their cost-of-funds advantage to grow more rapidly than\nsmaller banks. Expansionary monetary policy is then given a boost as these institutions grow at\neye-popping rates.\nBut what happens when financial conditions worsen? Too-big-to-fail banks must de-lever,\nshrinking their asset books and, in general, swimming against the tide of easier monetary policy.\nAs the weak capital position of these institutions becomes widely recognized, they find it\ndifficult and costly to raise funds. A weakened financial system with several of these banks will\ninduce a flight to quality, increasing credit spreads and interest rates at a time when the Fed is\nattempting to do just the opposite. This slows economic growth, reducing asset values and\noverall wealth as credit availability deteriorates further. An adverse-feedback loop is created,\nworking in direct opposition to the policy efforts of the central bank.\nThe existence of financial institutions that are too big to fail dramatically impacts the\ntransmission mechanisms of monetary policy. The blockages they create—in credit markets and\non balance sheets throughout the economy—compound our travails by making it more difficult\nto get the timing and dosage of monetary policy ―right.‖ They reduce the effectiveness of our\ntraditional tools, introducing a need for special liquidity and credit facilities that are difficult to\nunwind.\nI know my opinions on this subject will hardly endear me to the largest financial institutions. On\nhis death bed, Voltaire (who was neither a Hollywood lyricist nor a movie actor nor the president\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis) was asked to renounce the devil. He is said to have\nreplied that this was no time for making new enemies. Some think that during this time of crisis\nand with financial and economic recovery still so tenuous, it is not the right time to think about\nproposals that make the perfect the enemy of the good. I disagree. I believe we need to ―think\nlong,‖ as the Californian George Shultz likes to say, and the current policy prescription for\ntreatment of TBTF is a bit shortsighted or, at best, necessary but not sufficient. If we want to\navoid a repeat of what has just happened over the past 18 months, we need to exorcise the notion\n7\n\n\fthat an institution is too big to fail and remove all incentives for any institution to risk infecting\nthe health of the financial system. If we make some enemies in the process, so be it. The object is\nto get it right.\nThank you. I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\nNotes\n1\n\nIn Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke’s War on the Great Panic,” by David Wessel, New York: Crown Business, 2009,\np. 130.\n2\nSee note 1, p. 124.\n3\n―Back from the Abyss: Now What?‖ May 15, 2009, and ―Remarks Before the Washington Association of Money\nManagers,‖ May 28, 2009.\n4\nFederal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1, July 16, 2009.\n5\n―The Fed‘s Exit Strategy,‖ by Ben Bernanke, Wall Street Journal, July 21, 2009, p.

He is one of our country‟s most\neloquent preachers, and I am honored that he is here.\nWith such a distinguished man of the cloth present among this group of people dedicated to the\npursuit of mammon, I thought I would give a little sermon-ette this evening.\nHere are four quotes from financial scripture:\nThe first is from Charles Mackay‟s Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions, written in\n1841:\n“Every age has its peculiar folly—some scheme, project or\nphantasy [sic] into which it plunges, spurred on either by the love\nof gain, the necessity of excitement, or the mere force of\nimitation.”\n“Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they\ngo mad in herds....”\nThe second is taken from the father of central banking—Walter Bagehot—from his essay\n“Edward Gibbon,” in the 1856 edition of National Review:\n“[A]t particular times … people have a great deal of … money….\nAt intervals … the money of these people … is particularly large\nand craving: it seeks for some one to devour it, and there is [a]\n„plethora‟; it finds some one, and there is „speculation‟; it is\ndevoured, and there is „panic.‟”\n1\n\n\fFrom Liaquat Ahamed, who has written a superbly entertaining book, published\nearlier this year, titled Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World:\n“I maintain that the Great Depression was not some act of God or\nthe result of some deep-rooted contradictions of capitalism but the\ndirect result of a series of misjudgments by economic\npolicymakers.…”\nFinally, Paul Volcker as quoted in Bill Neikirk‟s Volcker: Portrait of the Money Man in 1987:\n“The Federal Reserve has no way of offsetting the financial market\npressure associated with excessive deficits.… Pushing more money\ninto the system to finance the Treasury would only serve to\nheighten fears about inflation and the future course of interest\nrates.”\nTonight, I will reference each of those passages as we explore where we have been, where we\nare today and the fiscal predicament that awaits us further down the road. But first, some context.\nReverend Harkins will no doubt have heard the story of the humble Presbyterian pastor who\nvisited a shelter where he found a man who looked particularly downtrodden. This generous\npastor took pity upon the man. He took him to a barber for a shave and a haircut and to a store\nfor a pair of shoes, a shirt, a tie and a new suit. The pastor then dropped the man back at the\nshelter, handed him $20 and told him, “Son, you have been saved. My church is just one block\naway from here. I want you to come to my church on Sunday and praise the Lord.”\nSunday came but the man did not. So immediately after the service, the pastor went to the\nshelter. There was the man, sitting in a rocking chair, all dressed up and beautifully groomed,\nreading a newspaper. “Son, I had asked you to come to my church this morning to give\ntestimony to having been saved. Where were you?” asked the pastor.\n“Pastor,” the man replied, “I surely did go to church. I woke up this morning, shaved my\nwhiskers, combed my hair, put on this beautiful shirt and tie you bought me and dressed in this\nnew suit. I put on these fancy new shoes. When I looked in the mirror, I felt like a millionaire. So\nI used the $20 to take a cab to the Episcopal church.”\nI certainly don‟t need to tell a room full of Washington money managers what got the nation into\nits current economic situation. A sudden new set of circumstances, easy money seemingly\nheaven-sent and the short-sighted suspension of time-tested, prudent financial practice led us on\nthe road, not to salvation, but to economic perdition.\nThe new set of circumstances included the economic and financial windfalls that came from at\nleast two major structural changes. The first was the end of the Cold War and the commercial\nreorientation of China, Vietnam, India and Eastern Europe, which unleashed enormous new\ncapacity for the increased production of goods and services, held down costs and restructured the\nglobal economic map. The second was the explosion of computational power and\n2\n\n\fcommunication ease that came from technological advancement and the Internet, facilitating\nglobalization and leapfrogging frontiers that formerly separated the economic landscape. The\nworld was our oyster. It simultaneously gave us new consumers and suppliers. It provided new\nsources of funds as well as new places to invest.\nEasy money may well have been encouraged by central banks that held interest rates too low for\ntoo long. But it was exacerbated by lenders, investors and consumers who—keen on enhancing\nreturns that seemed pedestrian with a flat yield curve anchored by low, risk-free rates—“craved”\nand “devoured” new risk instruments, to paraphrase Bagehot. As a result, they came up with new\n“schemes” and “projects” and “phantasies” made more enticing by expanded markets and\nfinancial innovation.\nShort-sightedness was manifest in the abandonment of prudential practices. For the banker and\nlender, the time-tested principle of “know your customer” took a back seat to the mad rush to\npackage and sell exposure to others. For the consumer, “living within your means” became a less\ncompelling discipline in a world where a house was not just a home but a means to financial\ngain. For the investor, prudence took on another dimension with the presumed ability to\nmathematize judgment and hedge away the risk of default.\nAnd yet, while the world had indeed changed, the behavioral pathology documented by Mackay\nand Bagehot in the 19th century—a pathology based on their studies of countless debacles\nthrough history—prevailed. A “plethora” of commercial and financial opportunity begat\n“speculative” excess that inevitably begat a “panic.” The thundering “herd,” spurred on by “the\nlove of gain, the necessity of excitement or mere force of imitation” and “mad” with irrational\nexuberance for the upside, suddenly realized in 2008 it had “devoured” more risk than it could\nstomach and panicked. The financial system seized up and the economy descended into\nrecession.\nWho is to blame? Well, if you had been listening to the radio on Feb. 26, 1933, you would know\nthe answer. You would have heard a crazed Father Charles Coughlin, pastor of the Shrine of the\nLittle Flower in Royal Oak, Mich., rail against “the Morgans, the Kuhn-Loebs, the Rothschilds,\nthe Dillon-Reads, the Federal Reserve banksters, the Mitchells 1 and the rest of the undeserving\ngroup, who without … the blood of patriotism … flowing in their veins have shackled the lives\nof men and of nations with the ponderous links of their golden chain.”\nAdvance the tape 76 years. If you substitute Goldman Sachs for the Rothschilds, Lehman\nBrothers for Kuhn-Loeb, AIG for Dillon Read, Ken Lewis or John Thain for “Sunshine Charlie”\nMitchell and keep the text about Federal Reserve “banksters,” you will have captured the liturgy\nof invective heard from Father Coughlin‟s contemporary secular cousins. Nothing is new under\nthe sun; old prejudices and conspiracy theories never die.2 On airwaves and in the blogosphere,\non editorial pages and even in the halls of Congress and foreign parliaments, critics are casting\nabout for whom to blame for “shackl(ing) the lives of men” and women from Bethesda to\n\n1\n\n“Sunshine Charlie” Mitchell was the head of National City Bank, the forerunner to Citigroup.\nFor instance, in a current best-selling book in China, Currency Wars, it is asserted that the major central banks—\nincluding the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England—are controlled by a small group of private bankers. These\nbankers make their profits through the control of the nation‟s money supply.\n2\n\n3\n\n\fBeijing with the “ponderous links” that took us to the very edge of the abyss of global economic\ncollapse.\nI will let you draw your own conclusions about who is to blame. In my time at the Federal\nReserve, starting in 2005 and working predominantly under the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke,\nmy colleagues and I have been focused primarily on finding a way to undo past errors and mend\nthe system.\nI believe that the initiatives taken by the Federal Reserve prevented us from falling into the\nchasm of an economic depression. Beginning in August of 2007, we confronted a total\nbreakdown of the financial system. Having announced our extension of term lending to banks in\nDecember, in rapid order, we then set in motion a series of steps to provide liquidity, strengthen\nthe security of certain banks, become the equivalent of market maker for key financial\ninstruments such as commercial paper and certain asset-backed securities and, in ways\nappropriate to the times, deliver on our mandate as lender of last resort.\nYou are all familiar with the efforts taken by the Federal Reserve to these ends. I won‟t review\nthem program by program this evening. I think it fair to say that with these actions the Federal\nReserve has done everything in its power to avoid making the modern equivalent of the\n“misjudgments” that Liaquat Ahamed argues were made by our predecessors in the 1930s (and, I\nshould add parenthetically, that everyone and their brother feel Japan made in the 1990s).\nThere is evidence that our actions have succeeded in pulling the financial markets and the\neconomy from the edge of the abyss. There are, as many have noted, some “green shoots”\nbeginning to sprout that will help end the contraction in output and set the stage for a recovery.\nThis is not to be Pollyannaish or imply that these sprouts are spreading like kudzu. But the\nknock-on effect of the Fed‟s direct efforts does seem to have reignited animal spirits in markets\nthat had been frozen. The commercial paper market has been revived. Mortgage rates have\ndeclined significantly. Issuance of corporate bonds has become robust. The premium over\nTreasuries that investment-grade corporations pay to borrow in the open market has fallen by\nmore than 35 percent since peaking last December. The same can be said of higher risk bonds as\nwell as jumbo mortgages—all markets considered to be at the far end of the risk spectrum. This\nround-trip back from last fall‟s unprecedented flight to quality is also reflected in the stock\nmarket, as equity markets have coursed upward and volatility has diminished.\nWhile it takes some time for these improved financial conditions to start helping the broad\neconomy, I am pleased to see a reaction on Main Street: The most recent reports indicate that\npurchasing managers see an abatement in the pace of decline in new orders; manufacturers\nsurveyed by the Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond and Dallas Feds, to varying degrees,\nreport a moderation in their previous rates of decline in activity; 3 retail sales are no longer\nplunging; and, as all of you heard from the Conference Board on Tuesday, consumers‟\nassessment of the economy over the next six months—driven primarily by slowing job losses—\nappears to be less pessimistic.\n\n3\n\nTexas produces more than 8 percent of the total manufactured goods in the United States, ranking second behind\nCalifornia in factory production.\n4\n\n\fThese are encouraging signs. But, to be sure, we are not out of the woods. We have miles to go\nbefore we sleep.\nCompared with the fourth quarter of last year, first quarter results for the nation‟s largest banks\nare encouraging, yet obvious challenges remain. Confidence among business women and men—\nthe creators of lasting, productive jobs and prosperity—has shown signs of revival but remains\nelusive. Consumers at home remain cautious, for fear of losing their homes or their jobs. The\nmarkets we sell into abroad—Mexico and Europe, for example—remain strikingly weak, while\nothers such as China are perhaps more robust but are insufficiently sized to fill the hole left by\nconsumers at home and in our larger export markets.4\nUnder these conditions, I have been forecasting a slow recovery. Not a V-shaped snapback—nor\neven a U-shaped one—but a very slow slog as we find a more sensible and sustainable mix\nbetween consumption, savings and investment. It is worth recalling that employment did not\nreach its nadir until 21 months after the end of the 2001 recession, though headwinds then were\nnot nearly as severe as those we face today.\nYou know the numbers that have been reported for the nation for the first quarter: Even after\nupcoming revisions, I venture we will find we contracted at somewhere between an annualized 5\nand 6 percent. The pace of decline will moderate in the current quarter, and then we are likely to\nbounce along the bottom for a while. I would be delighted, but surprised, if meaningful sustained\ngrowth gets under way before the end of the year. Regardless, increases in unemployment, while\nmitigated by the expansion of government (particularly the need for census takers), will likely\ntake us to a 10 percent jobless rate before we reverse course. And global excess capacity is likely\nto remain excessive for some time to come.\nAs to price stability—the touchstone of central banking—given the vast amount of slack\nworldwide, the near-term outlook for inflation is meek. Indeed, the recent pressures have been to\nthe deflationary side. As evidenced in the Dallas Fed‟s most recent manufacturing survey, firms\nreceiving lower prices for their goods outnumbered those receiving higher prices 11-to-1,\nalthough firms do expect deflationary pressures to begin subsiding.5\nNeither deflation nor inflation engenders confidence. Both distort the decisionmaking of\nhouseholds as well as businesses. Both inhibit sustainable employment growth. If you want to\nknow the outlook for inflation over the next quarter or next year, look at current domestic and\nglobal slack: It is doubtful that inflation will raise its ugly head until employment and capacity\nutilization tighten. Looking further out, however, Milton Friedman—who, in keeping with the\ntheme of this evening, I suppose I could safely refer to as the Moses of monetary policy—\nreminds us that inflation, defined as “a steady and sustained rise in prices,” is “always and\neverywhere a monetary phenomenon.”6 Bearing this in mind, we must be careful with the\ndeployment of our monetary initiatives.\n4\n\nThrough April, China‟s overall imports from the rest of the world dropped 23 percent from last year‟s level to\n$78.8 billion. The U.S. is presently exporting $5.6 billion a month in goods to China.\n5\n“Texas Manufacturing Remains Weak But Outlook Continues to Improve,” Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, press\nrelease, May 26, 2009.\n6\nThe quotes are taken from Milton Friedman‟s “Inflation: Causes and Consequences” in his book Dollars and\nDeficits, published by Friedman in 1968. Friedman clearly recognized that any of a wide variety of shocks can give\n5\n\n\fAs the nation‟s central bank, the Fed performs two major roles, in addition to its regulatory\nduties. One is the standard conduct of monetary policy—a blunt instrument of adjusting interest\nrates and the money supply to achieve our long-term objectives of price stability and sustainable\nemployment.\nThe Fed‟s other role is, as mentioned, to act as a lender of last resort—to stabilize financial\nmarkets when confidence breaks down and markets become unduly segmented and\ndysfunctional. This entails targeted injections of liquidity to keep markets functioning under dire\ncircumstances. Reflecting the larger role of securities markets in funding loans, the Federal\nReserve has extended its lender of last resort role beyond banks. Since the fall of 2007, the\nFederal Reserve has been aggressive in putting programs in place to revive the functioning of\nkey credit markets and pull the economy away from the brink. I point to the term auction (TAF)\nand commercial paper (CPFF) facilities as examples of initiatives that have worked as planned\nby the FOMC and are now shrinking in size. These actions are not permanent injections of\nmoney that may later fuel inflation, but rather are temporary injections of liquidity to stabilize\nmalfunctioning markets. As such, they are intended to promote financial stability, sustainable\ngrowth and price stability.\nCongress, spurred on by the new president, has been aggressive with fiscal policy. The good\nnews is that if fiscal policy has been properly designed—and time will tell if it has been—it\nshould propel the economy farther away from the edge and put it on its way to a new cycle of\neconomic growth, somewhat tentatively at first but hopefully gathering momentum as time\npasses.\nUnfortunately, that momentum faces a real, long-term threat: storm clouds on the horizon in the\nform of daunting fiscal imbalances.\nThat deficits will be high over the next few years seems clear, with a $1.8 trillion deficit\nexpected this year and $3.8 trillion in new debt issuance now forecast over the next five years.\nPerhaps more important, annual deficits exceeding half a trillion dollars are projected for at least\n10 years into the future, emphasizing that we as a nation will continue to spend considerably\nmore than we take in long after the current economic crisis.\nThe country‟s major newspapers recently reported with great urgency the administration‟s\nfinding that Social Security would begin spending more than it takes in by 2016—seven short\nyears from now. Left unreported was the fact that the discounted present value of entitlement\ndebt, over the infinite horizon, reached $104 trillion.7 This is almost eight times the annual gross\nrise to short-term changes in the price level. Too often, those who quote his inflation dictum fail to distinguish\nbetween temporary and sustained price movements.\n7\nEstimates for Social Security are compiled from the official 2009 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the\nFederal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds. The $15.1 trillion figure\npresented here is the amount by which promised benefits exceed expected revenues, primarily from payroll taxes,\nover the infinite horizon using a long-run discount rate of 2.9 percent.\nEstimates for Medicare are compiled from the official 2009 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal\nHospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds. The $88.9 trillion cumulative\nfigure presented here is the amount by which promised benefits for Medicare Parts A, B and D exceed expected\nrevenues over the infinite horizon using a long-run discount rate of 2.9 percent.\n6\n\n\fdomestic product of the United States—and almost 20 times the size of the debt our government\nis expected to accumulate between 2009 and 2014.\nMost of this entitlement shortfall comes from Medicare rather than Social Security. As you may\nknow, Medicare has three main components: Part A for hospital stays, Part B for doctor visits\nand Part D for prescription drugs. The fiscal shortfall for Part A alone is $36.4 trillion—about\none third of all entitlement debt. Part B‟s shortfall is just a tad larger, clocking in at $37 trillion.\nPart D—the latest addition to the Medicare program—registers a shortfall of $15.5 trillion. And\nSocial Security, the program about which various reforms have been so frequently mooted in\nrecent years, registers a deficit of $15.1 trillion—only one seventh of the total unfunded liability\nfrom entitlement programs.\nThis is the fiscal predicament to which I alluded earlier—a looming budgetary threat to our longterm economic prosperity. And while the announcement that the Social Security trust fund will\nbegin its decline one year earlier is an important fiscal event, the swelling of overall entitlement\ndebt to more than one hundred trillion dollars has far more serious implications for economic\ngrowth—implications we are poorly positioned to address given the budget deficits we face\ntoday.\nOur successor generations are coming to grips with this daunting reality. Faced with the prospect\nof a government that they believe may be unable to deliver on its promise of long-term fiscal\nbalance—particularly with regard to entitlement programs—these individuals might logically\nbegin to alter their consumption patterns, spending less today to save more for tomorrow. There\nis nothing wrong with increasing savings. But, in an economy driven by consumption, this\nintertemporal hedging may dampen the pace of future economic growth.\nOf course, any student of history knows that throughout time, governments unwilling to face the\nmusic and fund their liabilities have turned to monetary authorities to print their way out of their\npredicament. We all know by heart the pathologies that afflicted Weimar Germany, Argentina\nand other countries. And we have daily reminders from bond vigilantes like Bill Gross about the\nprospect of losing our AAA rating. This cannot be allowed to happen in America. Which is why\nI am pleased to see that the new administration has embraced what was hitherto perceived as the\nthird rail of American politics and brought the issue of unfunded entitlement liabilities to the\nfore. For the sake of our grandchildren, I hope that the administration and the Congress will take\nthis vexing beast of a problem by the horns and tame it.\n\nNeither estimate incorporates the value of program trust funds, currently estimated at $2.4 trillion for Social Security\nand $0.3 trillion for Medicare. Because spending down these trust funds will require the use of general revenue,\nsome budget analysts include them when calculating unfunded liabilities. If this is done, then the total figure would\nrise from $104 trillion to $106.7 trillion.\nThese figures also do not include current or projected future nonentitlement debt, including the $10.7 trillion\nnational debt as of the end of 2008, the $1.8 trillion deficit for this year, the $3.8 trillion in projected debt between\n2010 and 2014, and any future debt that might be compiled after 2014. If projected debt between now and 2014\nwere added, and no further nonentitlement debt were accumulated in the future, then the total figure would rise from\n$106.7 trillion to $123.0 trillion.\n\n7\n\n\fAgainst that background, it is important that monetary policymakers be especially sensitive to\nconcerns voiced about the dramatic expansion of the Fed‟s balance sheet in an era of high\ndeficits. I return to the Book of Ahamed and the Book of Volcker. Ahamed speaks of the\nmiscalculations of policymakers. Volcker warns that the Fed cannot monetize deficits without\nheightening fears of inflation and negatively impacting the future course of interest rates.\nThose of us responsible for developing monetary policy must constantly bear both observations\nin mind. We have been very careful to calibrate our actions so as to accommodate the needs of\ncredit markets and the economy—not political imperatives. We are well aware that some of our\nbalance sheet additions, designed to pull markets and the economy from the edge, have raised a\nfew eyebrows (like the $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities we have pledged to purchase\nif necessary—although it has unquestionably driven mortgage rates to historic lows). And while\nit is not unusual for the System Open Market Account to buy Treasuries along the yield curve,\nthe Federal Open Market Committee‟s (FOMC) decision to purchase $300 billion in U.S.\nTreasuries—a decision made to improve the tone in private credit markets—has been viewed by\nsome as skating a little too close to the edge of political accommodation.\nI can tell you that the FOMC is well aware of the doubts being voiced about its intentions. I can\nalso tell you that nobody I know on the committee wants to maintain our current posture for any\nlonger and to any greater degree than is minimally necessary to restore the efficacy of the credit\nmarkets and buttress economic recovery without inflationary consequences. Indeed, as I speak,\nwe are studying ways to unwind our balance sheet in a timely way.\nIn the meantime, looming before us is the prospect of a heavy calendar of debt issuance by the\nTreasury. Between now and the end of the current fiscal year in October, the Treasury will issue\njust over $1 trillion in net new debt, with at least that much to follow in fiscal 2010. As the Book\nof Volcker warns, the Federal Open Market Committee can ill afford to be perceived as\nmonetizing debt, lest we come to be viewed as an agent of, rather than an independent guardian\nagainst, future inflation and drive real interest rates higher.\nYou may wish to note that, press and analysts‟ reports to the contrary, a keen student of the H.4.1\nand the Foreign and International Monetary Authority (FIMA) custody holdings reports of the\nFed will detect that foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasuries and agencies have been growing\nat a robust pace, not shrinking. And from what I can detect from the activity of so-called indirect\nbidders in Treasury auctions—indirect bidders submit competitive bids through others rather\nthan directly; central banks are among those who commonly bid indirectly—there continues to\nbe strong demand for longer duration Treasuries—again, contrary to rumors and press reports.\nThus, to date, our actions have not given rise to concern that we will violate Paul‟s Dictum.\nThis is important, for there are concerns in some quarters that the Federal Reserve will be\npoliticized. For example, there have been suggestions that Congress should be involved in the\nselection of Federal Reserve Bank presidents, who, unlike the seven members of the Board of\nGovernors, are not appointed by the president nor confirmed by the Senate. I trust that Congress\nwill resist this initiative and not upset the careful federation that has for so long balanced the\ninterests of Main Street with those of Washington, just as we at the Federal Reserve must resist\nthe urgings of some to accommodate the short-term financing needs of the Treasury.\n\n8\n\n\fYour central bank has worked hard to pull the economy back from the abyss. To be sure, the\nFOMC has taken risks to do so. We have no doubt erred on occasion, but for the most part, I\nthink we have gotten it right—primarily because each of us has an abiding faith in the timetested virtues of conducting responsible monetary policy. We will work hard to remain virtuous,\nalways bearing in mind that our job is to conduct monetary policy with the simple, yet profound,\nmission of underpinning sustainable economic growth without sacrificing price stability.\nSo much for the Gospel according to the Dallas Fed! Thank you for letting me speak to you\ntonight. I will now do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you have.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nMay 22, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fCommencement Address\nRichard W. Fisher\nI have enjoyed a rich history with this great school. St. Mark’s educated my two sons, Anders\nand James. My wife, Nancy, served on its board of trustees. Many of my closest and most\nrespected friends proudly claim this fine institution as their alma mater. And I was delighted to\nhear this morning that William Hicks was this year’s winner of the Richard and Nancy Fisher\nCommunity Service Award. I know and love St. Mark’s. It is an honor to have been chosen to be\nyour commencement speaker.\nIt is a special honor to be introduced by Arnie Holtberg, a great headmaster. The best definition\nof a leader that I know is summarized in John Paul Jones’ creed. The “Father of the Navy”\ndefined the perfect officer as a man “of liberal education, refined manners, punctilious courtesy,\nand the nicest sense of personal honor.” That describes your headmaster to a “T.” Mr. Holtberg,\nthank you for your leadership of this magnificent school.\nBefore I begin, I want the Class of 2009 to stand up. Look around this courtyard. All of these\npeople have come to celebrate your success. These are your parents and grandparents, cousins,\nuncles and aunts, your brothers and sisters, your friends, your teachers and coaches and\ncounselors. They have been by your side through joyful moments and less joyful ones. They\nhave encouraged you. They have believed in you. And they have occasionally badgered and\nhectored you and driven you nuts. All to good effect. They are here with glad and happy hearts to\ncelebrate your admission to the society of educated men. Give them a round of applause. Thank\nthem for loving you.\nNow, please be seated.\nThe only thing that now stands between you and the reception of your diploma is … me. So I\nwill make it snappy.\nBy now, you have taken enough English and writing courses to know the definition of a good\nessay: It is a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised as your own. Most graduation\nspeeches are no different. The standard routine for a commencement speaker is to dig through\nBartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations to find something said by some sage that will\ngrace a graduation ceremony with a lesson you can take with you as you go off into this\nmysterious and challenging world.\nTo find something profound that I might pinch for your amusement this evening, I poured over\nthe sayings of the great minds of the ages: Plato, Socrates, Mencius, Muhammed, St. Augustine,\nVoltaire, Martin Luther … Manny Ramirez, Miley Cyrus.\nThe maxims put forward by the sages of the ages are inspiring, but as Marksmen, you already\nknow them: be disciplined; be prepared; be loyal and thrifty and brave; don’t waste your talents;\nquestion authority (but not the headmaster); take risks; push the envelope; be true to yourself, to\nyour school, to your country; never promise more than you can deliver; never compromise your\nintegrity; never forget that you have been given talent to do good; never, never, never, never give\n1\n\n\fup the pursuit of excellence.\nThese are all good words. But, truth be told, it would save time and expedite many a graduation\nceremony if its organizers would forgo the speaker and simply remind the graduating class to\noccasionally read or listen to the books-on-tape versions of the Bible or the Koran or\nShakespeare or Confucius—the ultimate sources of almost every graduation speech I have ever\nread or listened to.\nHow could I, a lowly central banker whose musings are given to the arcana of economic and\nmonetary policy, possibly improve upon the wisdom of the ultimate sources? Not easily. So I\ndug deep into my memory banks and called upon a source more erudite than Shakespeare and\nmore insightful than Confucius … my mother.\nMy mother was a stoic Norwegian. She was born and raised in an outpost in South Africa, lost\nher father when she was 4 in the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and grew up without the benefit\nof the type of education you have received at St. Mark’s. Yet she was a wise woman. She was a\nkind of female Nordic Yogi Berra: She dispensed exquisite pearls of wisdom to her three boys.\nOne is especially germane for this evening. She would say: “Never let your brains go to your\nhead.” The pun is horrific but the message is profound: To achieve success you will need to keep\nyour superb education and your talent in perspective. Brains and the gift of talent are necessary\nbut insufficient for success in life.\nTime and again, in business and research labs and universities and government, we see instances\nwhere men and women of towering intellect get far at first but ultimately snatch defeat from the\njaws of victory. They do so because they have forgotten to develop their emotional quotient with\nthe same devotion they applied to developing their intellectual quotient. My heartfelt advice to\nyou is to work as hard on expanding your EQ as you have on harnessing your IQ. You all have\ngreat futures ahead of you. You will get there just as fast and enjoy it more if you remember that\na sound mind resides most comfortably in a sound, well-rounded person and that a sound, wellrounded person has more than a superior education and brain. The whole person is as important\nan achievement for those few who have been admitted to the “society of educated men and\nwomen” as is the achievement of intellectual excellence. Again, remember the creed of John\nPaul Jones. Being possessed of refined manners, punctilious courtesy and the nicest sense of\npersonal honor are just as important to the success of a leader as a great education.\nWhich brings me to the last requirement for a commencement oration: a smattering of Latin. You\ndon’t sound serious at a commencement unless you show off your command of an ancient\ntongue. A serious speaker might conclude with labor omnia vincit—a stern reminder that labor\nconquers all things. It is true, indeed, that you can’t rest on your laurels or your good family\nname or a St. Mark’s education or luck. You have to work hard to succeed. And to do so you\nhave to remember mens sana en corpore sano—a sound mind resides best in a sound body.\nBut that is way too ponderous. This is a festive night! So I will conclude with “Bubbus, sed\npossum explicare; non sed possum comprehendere.”\nFor those of you unschooled in the language of the ancient Romans, that is Texas-ized Latin for\n“Bubba, I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”\n2\n\n\fThis evening I have done my best to explain to the Class of 2009 that success comes to those\nwho best put their talents in context and who connect their substantial intellectual achievement to\nan equally developed emotional capacity. Those of us who lead cerebral lives must constantly\nstrive to elevate our “people skills” to a level equal to our intellectual skills. I can explain that to\nyou ad nauseam. But you must come to understand it on your own.\nAnd if you do—if you continue through life remembering that the “whole boy is the best boy”—\nmy guess is that someday you will be standing on the stage at St. Mark’s giving a\ncommencement speech to some future generation of lucky graduates of this great school. And\nhaving the greatest pleasure a man can have: quoting your mom.\nGod bless you and good luck.\n\n3\n\n\f"

        "content": "Back from the Abyss: Now What?\nRemarks before the 125th Annual Convention of the Texas Bankers Association\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSan Antonio, Texas\nMay 15, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fBack from the Abyss: Now What?\nRichard W. Fisher\n“Every age has its peculiar folly—some scheme, project or\nphantasy [sic] into which it plunges, spurred on either by the love\nof gain, the necessity of excitement, or the mere force of\nimitation.”\n“Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they\ngo mad in herds....”\nCharles Mackay\nMemoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions (1841)\n\n“[a]t particular times … people have a great deal of … money….\nAt intervals … the money of these people … is particularly large\nand craving: it seeks for some one to devour it, and there is (a)\n„plethora‟; it finds some one, and there is „speculation‟; it is\ndevoured, and there is „panic.‟”\nWalter Bagehot\n“Edward Gibbon,” National Review (1856)\n\n“I maintain that the Great Depression was not some act of God or\nthe result of some deep-rooted contradictions of capitalism but the\ndirect result of a series of misjudgments by economic\npolicymakers.…”\nLiaquat Ahamed\nLords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World (2009)\n\n“The Federal Reserve has no way of offsetting the financial market\npressure associated with excessive deficits.… Pushing more money\ninto the system to finance the Treasury would only serve to\nheighten fears about inflation and the future course of interest\nrates.”\nPaul Volcker (1982)\nas quoted in William R. Neikirk‟s\nVolcker: Portrait of the Money Man (1987)\n\n1\n\n\fI have just read to you four passages from financial scripture. In this morning‟s sermon, I plan to\nmake reference to each of those passages as we explore where we have been and where we might\nbe headed.\nBut first, I want to thank the Texas Bankers Association for having me here this morning and\nVictor Pierson, the honorable mayor of Jamaica Beach and president of Moody National Bank,\nfor that kind introduction. Besides being pivotal in the organization of the TBA some 125 years\nago, the Moody family has played a rich role in the life of Texas since well before that time (a\nfulsome history I heard often—always accompanied with a wry sense of humor—from old Dan\nOppenheimer back in the 1980s). The lineal and business and banking descendents of Col.\nWilliam L. Moody have navigated hurricanes, wars, depressions and banking crises—all of epic\nproportions—and have always remained standing. They are a monument to Texas resilience. It is\nan honor to be introduced by anybody associated with the Moody legacy.\nNow to the sermon.\nI once managed Dan Oppenheimer‟s personal portfolio. One afternoon in 1982, I was visiting\nDan at the Oppenheimer Bank here in San Antonio. A Baptist preacher came in to ask him for a\n“loan.”1 He wanted to buy some cattle. Dan was teasing him about the prosperity he had\nachieved while preaching from the pulpit and warned him not to count on its permanence. “Your\ncongregation might become as prominent as you,” he said, “and then migrate to a nicer church.”\nTo illustrate the point, he invented a story about a Baptist preacher who visited a shelter where\nhe found a man who looked particularly downtrodden. The generous preacher took pity upon the\nman. He took him to a barber for a shave and a haircut and to a store for a pair of shoes, a shirt, a\ntie and a new suit. The preacher then dropped the man back at the shelter, handed him $20 and\ntold him, “Son, you have been saved. The Baptist church is just one block away from here. I\nwant you to come to my church on Sunday and praise the Lord.”\nSunday came but the man did not. So immediately after the service, the preacher went to the\nshelter. There was the man, sitting in a rocking chair, all dressed up and beautifully groomed,\nreading a newspaper. “Son, I had asked you to come to the Baptist church this morning to give\ntestimony to having been saved. Where were you?” asked the preacher.\n“Pastor,” the man replied, “I surely did go to church. I woke up this morning, shaved my\nwhiskers, combed my hair, put on this beautiful shirt and tie you bought me and dressed in this\nnew suit. I put on these fancy new shoes. When I looked in the mirror, I felt like a millionaire. So\nI spent the $20 and took a cab to the Episcopal church.”\nI certainly don‟t need to tell a room full of Texas bankers what got the nation into its current\neconomic situation. A sudden new set of circumstances, easy money seemingly heaven-sent and\nthe short-sighted suspension of time-tested, prudent financial practice led us on the road, not to\nsalvation, but to economic perdition.\n1\n\nOppenheimer Bank was the largest of the then five surviving private unregulated banks in Texas. Typically, a loan\nfrom Oppenheimer consisted of writing a check and asking Dan to cover it with some rate of interest charged. Loans\nwere, in essence, overdrafts. Oppenheimer knew every virtue and vice of his clientele; the bank was privately owned\nand as principal, Dan viewed loans as essentially lending his own money. The bank reportedly never lost a dime. It\nclosed one year after Dan‟s death in 1987.\n2\n\n\fAllow me to address each of these individually.\nThe new set of circumstances included the economic and financial windfalls that came from at\nleast two major structural changes. The first was the end of the Cold War and the commercial\nreorientation of China, Vietnam, India and Eastern Europe, which unleashed enormous new\ncapacity for the increased production of goods and services, held down costs and restructured the\nglobal economic map. The second was the explosion of computational power and\ncommunication ease that came from technological advancement and the Internet, facilitating\nglobalization and leapfrogging frontiers that formerly separated the economic landscape. The\nworld was our oyster. It simultaneously gave us new consumers and suppliers. It provided new\nsources of funds as well as new places to invest.\nThe easy money may well have been encouraged by central banks that held interest rates too low\nfor too long. But it was exacerbated by lenders, investors and consumers who—keen on\nenhancing returns that seemed pedestrian with a flat yield curve anchored by low, risk-free\nrates—“craved” and “devoured” new risk instruments. As a result, they came up with new\n“schemes” and “projects” and “phantasies” made more enticing by expanded markets and\nfinancial innovation.\nThe short-sightedness was manifest in the abandonment of prudential practices. For the banker\nand lender, the time-tested principle of “know your customer” took a back seat to the mad rush to\npackage and sell exposure to others. For the consumer, living within your means became a less\ncompelling discipline in a world where a house was not just a home but a means to financial\ngain. For the investor, prudence took on another dimension with the presumed ability to\nmathematize judgment and hedge away the risk of default.\nAnd yet, while the world had indeed changed, the behavioral pathology documented by Mackay\nand Bagehot in the 19th century—a pathology based on their studies of countless debacles\nthrough history—prevailed. A “plethora” of commercial and financial opportunity begat\n“speculative” excess that inevitably begat a “panic.” The thundering “herd,” spurred on by “the\nlove of gain, the necessity of excitement or mere force of imitation” and “mad” with irrational\nexuberance for the upside, suddenly realized in 2008 it had “devoured” more risk than it could\nstomach and panicked. The financial system seized up and the economy descended into\nrecession.\nWho is to blame? Well, if you had been listening to the radio on Feb. 26, 1933, you would know\nthe answer. You would have heard a crazed Father Charles Coughlin, pastor of the Shrine of the\nLittle Flower in Royal Oak, Mich., rail against “the Morgans, the Kuhn-Loebs, the Rothschilds,\nthe Dillon-Reads, the Federal Reserve banksters, the Mitchells 2 and the rest of the undeserving\ngroup, who without … the blood of patriotism … flowing in their veins have shackled the lives\nof men and of nations with the ponderous links of their golden chain.”\nAdvance the tape 76 years. If you substitute Goldman Sachs for the Rothschilds, Lehman\nBrothers for Kuhn-Loeb, AIG for Dillon Read, Ken Lewis, Sandy Weill or John Thain for\n“Sunshine Charlie” Mitchell and keep the text about Federal Reserve “banksters,” you will have\ncaptured the liturgy of invective heard from Father Coughlin‟s contemporary secular cousins. On\n2\n\n“Sunshine Charlie” Mitchell was the head of National City Bank, the forerunner to Citigroup.\n3\n\n\fairwaves and in the blogosphere, on editorial pages and even in the halls of Congress and foreign\nparliaments, critics have been casting about for whom to blame for “shackl(ing) the lives of\nmen” and women from Bastrop to Beijing with the “ponderous links” that took us to the very\nedge of the abyss of global economic collapse.\nI will let you draw your own conclusions about who is to blame. In my time at the Federal\nReserve, starting in 2005 and working predominantly under the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke,\nmy colleagues and I have been focused primarily on finding a way to undo past errors and mend\nthe system.\nI believe that the initiatives taken by my fellow “banksters” at the Federal Reserve prevented us\nfrom falling into the chasm of an economic depression. Beginning in August of 2007, we\nconfronted a total breakdown of the financial system. In rapid order, we undertook a series of\nsteps. We:\n—Created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds;\n—Initiated new measures in cooperation with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp. to strengthen the security of certain banks;\n—Undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the\nfinancial system;\n—Began to pay interest on bank reserves;\n—Announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie\nMae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, then increased that sum to $200 billion;\n—Announced we would buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie,\nFreddie and Ginnie Mae, then increased that sum to $1.25 trillion;\n—Announced a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by\nstudent loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business\nAdministration, a facility which we have since stated we were prepared to expand significantly\nto other types of securities and beyond our originally planned $200 billion to $1 trillion; and\n—Began the process of purchasing up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities between\nMarch and September to help improve conditions in private credit markets.\nAnd, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the fed funds\nrate to between zero and one-quarter of 1 percent, a process I supported once it became clear that\nthe immediate inflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge\nbanks to borrow from our discount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\nIn summary, the Federal Reserve did everything in its power to avoid making the modern\nequivalent of the “misjudgments” that Liaquat Ahamed argues were made by our predecessors in\n4\n\n\fthe 1930s (and, I should add parenthetically, that everyone and their sister feel Japan made in the\n1990s).\nThere is evidence that our actions have succeeded in pulling the financial markets and the\neconomy from the edge of the abyss. There are, as many have noted, some “green shoots” that\nhave begun to sprout that will help end the contraction in output and set the stage for a recovery.\nIn the world of finance, interest rates in key areas such as mortgages and the London interbank\nmarket have declined dramatically, enlivening the housing markets and reviving interbank\nlending; private bond market issuance has resumed and, indeed as you will see in this week and\nnext week‟s issuance calendar, at robust levels for both high-grade and junk issuers; and the\nstock market has rallied from its lows, bringing with it a surge in the volume of new stock\nissuance. While it takes some time for these improved financial conditions to start helping the\nbroad economy, I am happy to see that some green shoots are also starting to emerge on Main\nStreet: The most recent reports indicate that job losses may be slowing; trucking companies—a\ngroup often looked to as a leading indicator—report a slight pickup in sales; purchasing\nmanagers are reporting that the pace of decline in new orders has abated; and retail sales are\ngetting slightly less worse.\nThese are encouraging signs. But we are not out of the woods. We have miles to go before we\nsleep.\nFirst quarter results for the nation‟s largest banks are encouraging, but challenges remain.\nConfidence among business women and men—the creators of lasting, productive jobs and\nprosperity—has shown signs of revival but remains elusive. Consumers at home remain cautious,\nfor fear of losing their homes or their jobs. The markets we sell into abroad—Mexico and\nEurope, for example—remain weak, while others such as China are perhaps more robust but are\ninsufficiently sized to fill the hole left by consumers at home and in our larger export markets. 3\nUnder these conditions, I envision a slow recovery. Not a V-shaped snapback—nor even a Ushaped one—but a very slow slog as we find a more sensible and sustainable mix between\nconsumption and savings and investment.\nYou know the numbers that have been reported for the nation for the first quarter: Even after\nupcoming revisions, I venture we‟ll find we contracted at somewhere between 5 and 6 percent at\nan annual rate. The pace of decline will moderate in the current quarter, and then we‟re likely to\nbounce along the bottom for a while, perhaps punching through to positive growth as 2010\ndawns. I would be delighted, but surprised, if meaningful sustained growth gets under way any\nearlier. Regardless, increases in unemployment, while mitigated by the expansion of government\n(particularly the need for census takers) will likely take us to a 10 percent jobless rate before we\nreverse course. And global excess capacity is likely to remain excessive for some time to come.\nAs to price stability—the touchstone of central banking—given the vast amount of slack\nworldwide, the near-term outlook for inflation is meek. Indeed, the recent pressures have been to\nthe deflationary side, though we seem to have beaten that back.\n\n3\n\nThrough April, China‟s overall imports from the rest of the world dropped 23 percent from last year‟s level to\n$78.8 billion. The U.S. is presently exporting $5.6 billion a month in goods to China.\n5\n\n\fNeither deflation nor inflation engenders confidence. Both distort decisionmaking of households\nas well as businesses. Both inhibit sustainable employment growth. If you want to know the\noutlook for inflation over the next quarter or next year, look at current domestic and global slack:\nIt is doubtful that inflation will raise its ugly head until employment and capacity utilization\ntighten. Looking further out, however, Milton Friedman—whom many consider the Moses of\nmonetary policy—reminds us that inflation, defined as “a steady and sustained rise in prices,” is\n“always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”4 Bearing this in mind, we must be careful\nwith the deployment of our monetary initiatives.\nAs the nation‟s central bank, the Fed performs two major roles. One is the standard conduct of\nmonetary policy—a blunt instrument of adjusting interest rates and the money supply to achieve\nour long-term objectives of price stability and sustainable employment. In performing that role,\nthe Fed has lowered short-term interest rates to help cushion the economic downturn.\nThe Fed‟s other role is to act as a lender of last resort—to stabilize financial markets when\nconfidence breaks down and markets become unduly segmented and dysfunctional. This entails\ntargeted injections of liquidity to keep markets functioning under dire circumstances. Reflecting\nthe larger role of securities markets in funding loans, the Federal Reserve has extended its lender\nof last resort role beyond banks. Since the fall of 2007, the Federal Reserve has been aggressive\nin putting programs in place to revive the functioning of key credit markets and pull the economy\naway from the brink. These actions are not permanent injections of money that may later fuel\ninflation, but rather are temporary injections of liquidity to stabilize malfunctioning markets. As\nsuch, they are intended to promote financial stability, sustainable growth and price stability.\nThe Congress, spurred on by the new president, has been aggressive with fiscal policy. The good\nnews is that if fiscal policy has been properly designed—and time will tell if it has been—it\nshould propel the economy farther away from the edge and put it on its way to a new cycle of\neconomic growth, somewhat tentatively at first but hopefully gathering momentum as time\npasses.\nPeople are understandably nervous about the combination of a dramatic expansion of the Fed‟s\nbalance sheet and a ballooning of federal budget deficits. I return to the Book of Ahamed and the\nBook of Volcker. Ahamed speaks of the miscalculations of policymakers. Volcker warns that the\nFed cannot monetize deficits without heightening fears of inflation and negatively impacting the\nfuture course of interest rates.\nThose of us responsible for developing monetary policy must constantly bear both observations\nin mind. We have been very careful to calibrate our actions so as to accommodate the needs of\ncredit markets and the economy, not political imperatives. We are well aware that some of our\nbalance sheet additions, designed to pull markets and the economy from the edge, have raised a\nfew eyebrows (like the $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities we have pledged to purchase\nif necessary—although it has unquestionably driven mortgage rates to historic lows). And while\nit is not unusual for the System Open Market Account to buy Treasuries along the yield curve,\n4\n\nThe quotes are taken from Milton Friedman‟s “Inflation: Causes and Consequences” in his book Dollars and\nDeficits, published by Friedman in 1968. Friedman clearly recognized that any of a wide variety of shocks can give\nrise to short-term changes in the price level. Too often, those who quote his inflation dictum fail to distinguish\nbetween temporary and sustained price movements.\n6\n\n\fthe FOMC‟s decision to purchase $300 billion in U.S. Treasuries—a decision made to improve\nthe tone in the private credit markets—has been viewed by some as skating a little too close to\nthe edge of political accommodation.\nI can tell you that the FOMC is well aware of the doubts being voiced about its intentions. I can\nalso tell you that nobody I know on the committee wants to maintain our current posture for any\nlonger and to any greater degree than is minimally necessary to restore the efficacy of the credit\nmarkets and buttress economic recovery without inflationary consequences. Indeed, as I speak,\nwe are studying ways to unwind our balance sheet in a timely way. Chairman Bernanke spoke of\nthis just this past Monday in Georgia.\nIn the meantime, looming before us is the prospect of a heavy calendar of debt issuance by the\nTreasury. Between now and the end of the current fiscal year in October, the Treasury will issue\njust over $1 trillion in net new debt, with at least that much to follow in fiscal 2010. As the Book\nof Volcker warns, the Federal Open Market Committee can ill afford to be perceived as\nmonetizing that debt, lest we come to be viewed as an agent of, rather than an independent\nguardian against, future inflation.\nAlready, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve will be politicized. For example, some have\ncalled for increased congressional involvement in the selection of Federal Reserve policymakers\nand a reduced role for member banks. I trust that the Congress will resist this initiative and not\nupset the careful federation that has for so long balanced the interests of Main Street with those\nof Washington, just as we at the Federal Reserve must resist the urgings of some to\naccommodate the short-term financing needs of the Treasury.\nYour central bank has worked hard to pull the economy back from the abyss. To be sure, the\nFOMC has taken risks to do so. We have no doubt erred on occasion, but for the most part, I\nthink we have gotten it right—primarily because each of us has an abiding faith in the timetested virtues of conducting responsible monetary policy. We will work hard to remain virtuous,\nalways bearing in mind that our job is to conduct monetary policy with the simple, yet profound,\nmission of underpinning sustainable economic growth without sacrificing price stability.\nSo much for the Gospel according to the Dallas Fed! Thank you for letting me be here. Thank\nyou for letting me serve you. And thank you for letting me tell one of my favorite stories about\nold Dan Oppenheimer, God rest his witty old banker‟s soul.\nIn true central banking fashion, I will now do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you\nhave.\n\n7\n\n\f"

        "content": "The Economic Predicament of the\nUnited States and the Federal Reserve’s\nResponse in a Globalized World\nRemarks before Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nBeijing, China\nApril 17, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Economic Predicament of the United States and the\nFederal Reserve’s Response in a Globalized World\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you. I am delighted to be here at Tsinghua University, together with my colleagues, Mark\nWynne, who is director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ Globalization and Monetary\nPolicy Institute, and Tao Wu, a Hubei-born senior economist and policy advisor at the Dallas\nFed.\nI may have the longest experience in China not only of any Federal Reserve official, but perhaps\nof any American policymaker you will ever meet! My native Australian father and South\nAfrican-born mother sailed out of Shanghai on the S.S. President Wilson just as the port was\nbeing shut down by the soon-to-be victorious forces of the Communist revolutionaries in 1948.\nIn a story too long to tell here, my father had been dispatched to collect a dollar payment owed\nan American company—the Spazier Chemical and Soap Company. They left Shanghai for the\nU.S. with more than the money due Spazier: My mother was with child—me—and I was born\nthe following March.\nSo my bona fides for standing at this lectern at this prestigious university in Beijing to discuss\nthe economic predicament of the United States (and the Federal Reserve’s response) in a\nglobalized world are as follows: I was assembled by an Australian–South African consortium in\nChina, then shipped across the Pacific to become one of the innumerable factors that make for a\ndynamic economy that is uniquely American. When I served my government as an ambassador\nand trade representative in negotiating the bilateral aspects of your country’s accession to the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), Madame Wu Yi once told me, ―Of course you have done\nwell in America. You were manufactured in China!‖\nThirty years after my date of ―manufacture,‖ I served in the Carter administration as coordinator\nof policy planning and assistant to Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal. Secretary\nBlumenthal brought me to China in 1979. I mention this for a reason. That early experience in\nChina, coupled with my involvement 20 years later as deputy U.S. trade representative in\nnegotiating China’s accession to the WTO for President Clinton, forms the lens through which I\nnow view China’s success, challenges and potential.\nI am going to anchor my remarks today with some perspectives gained from that trip to China in\n1979. Then I will turn to the economic situation of the United States and the Federal Reserve’s\nresponse, in keeping with our duties as the central bank of the largest economy in the world.\nFinally, I will endeavor to answer any questions you wish to ask.\nThroughout, please bear in mind that I am a Texan. Texans speak plainly and directly. In an\nacademic setting like Tsinghua, I trust you will consider my candor as keeping fully in the spirit\nof intellectual exchange.\nA Short Historical Perspective\nPresident Nixon famously normalized political relations with China in his meetings with Mao\nZedong and Zhou Enlai in 1972. It fell to President Carter, however, to settle the counterclaims\n1\n\n\fbetween the U.S. and China that stemmed from the Communist takeover in 1949. Chairman\nMao’s forces did not seize the cash of Spazier Chemical and Soap, but they did seize the railroad\nstock and other assets the U.S. had lent to the Nationalist government; the U.S. government, in\nturn, retaliated by freezing China’s accounts in U.S. banks. Without settling those counterclaims,\nwe could not normally trade with each other. So after months of rigorous preparation, at the\nbehest of President Carter, Secretary Blumenthal and his team, including me as the secretary’s\nfaithful chef de cabinet, dispatched to Beijing on Feb. 23, 1979, to settle the claims. We met with\nSecretary Blumenthal’s official counterpart, Finance Minister Zhang Jin-fu, then with Deng\nXiaoping and Chairman Hua Guofeng.1 We sealed the preliminary deal on March 1, after\narduous negotiations with Deng, and that day officially raised the flag over the American\nEmbassy in Beijing, establishing the fulsome diplomatic presence of the United States in China.\nThe memories of that trip flooded back as I prepared for today’s lecture.\nWhen we landed in Beijing on Saturday night, Feb. 24, 1979, our delegation was whisked off to\nthe official guesthouse in Red Flag limousines. The roads into Beijing had no cars—not because\nthe route had been cordoned off for our delegation but because there simply weren’t any. What\ntraffic we did see included skinny horses, donkeys, camels, oxen, exhaust-spewing trucks and\ncountless bicycles made in the Forever bicycle factory in Shanghai for the purpose of realizing\nZhou’s ―four modernizations.‖\nThat was my first hands-on impression of China: There were no cars. Imagine that! Now, 30\nyears later, anybody attempting to navigate Chang’an Avenue on a bicycle would be taking his\nlife in his hands. Beijing alone has over 2.5 million cars, and China overall roughly 40 million.\nAfter we reached the initial agreement to settle our claims, we flew to Shanghai on a People’s\nLiberation Army plane for a little R&R before returning to Beijing to tidy up some fine points\nand sign our accord. Your government had thoughtfully picked out the prettiest military women\nthey could muster to serve us drinks and meals on the flight. On a whim, my counterpart and seat\nmate from the State Department, Robert Hormats, who is now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs,\ntook out a Polaroid camera and took a picture of these impromptu flight attendants. You would\nhave thought he had struck a match in some far corner of the world where fire had never been\nseen. The flight attendants squealed with delight, and the entire crew, including the pilots, came\nto the back of the plane to examine this previously unseen, newfangled technology that allowed\nphotographs to develop after only a minute or so. Think about that. This was roughly a quarter\ncentury after Polaroid had become commonplace in the U.S. and four years after the first userfriendly personal computer was brought to market by Steve Jobs and the Apple Corporation. Yet,\nthe Chinese public had never seen an ―instant‖ camera, let alone heard of a personal computer.\nPolaroid has since filed for bankruptcy, having been overtaken by microprocessor-driven\nelectronic cameras and photo-capable cell phones. Today, China annually produces roughly 100\nmillion microcomputers, and it has 650 million domestic cell phone subscribers. Your country\n\n1\n\nTwo of my favorite mementos are one of me standing above and right behind Deng in a group photo and another\nthat appeared on the front page of the People’s Daily on March 1, 1979, of Hua escorting Secretary Blumenthal,\nTreasury Undersecretary Anthony Solomon and Assistant Secretary of State Jules Katz, with me in tow, into the\nGreat Hall of the People.\n2\n\n\fhas become the world’s largest producer of semiconductors and the leading exporter of\ninformation technology goods.\nWhich brings me to China’s willingness to adopt and adapt. When Deng Xiaoping entered the\nroom for the initial encounter with our delegation in the Great Hall of the People, he cackled,\n―Where are these big American capitalists we Chinese are supposed to be so afraid of?‖ During\nour meeting, he made a remark that paralleled his famous ―black cat, white cat‖ theme—―it\ndoesn’t matter if the cat is white or black as long as it catches mice.‖ Deng’s remarks\nencapsulated the importance of practical results over political correctness and economic\ndevelopment over ideological purity—both hallmarks of modern China. Deng made it clear to\nour delegation that China was intent on modernization and that the Chinese cat would be focused\non catching droves of economic mice as it engaged the rest of the world, starting with the inputs\nand access from trade that would be liberated with our settlement that week.\nThis China has done. In 1979, the U.S. imported a mere $595 million from China under onerous\ntariffs; the Chinese did not have a single dollar in official reserves. Now, you send more than\n$300 billion in goods annually to the U.S. and hold on the order of $2 trillion in foreign\nexchange reserves, a majority component of which are U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Until\nrecently, since Deng’s ascendancy, China has grown its economy at around 10 percent per\nannum, has become the world’s pivotal factory and is quickly moving to the cutting edge of\ntechnology.\nIt is worth noting that Deng and his successors’ approach to modernization differed from that of\nJapan. A contemporary of Deng Xiaoping told me that in a conversation with him in 1978, Deng\nhad decided that, unlike Japan’s decision to utilize national champions to build its economy and\nthen engage the world to leverage Japanese prosperity, the Singapore model of attracting the best\nand brightest from around the world up front would better pave the way for domestic\ndevelopment and quick growth. Thus, from the get-go, China has had an inherent stake in the\nsuccess of globalization.\nOne final impression from that trip in 1979: During that trip, we were treated to a soiree in the\nGreat Hall of the People on Feb. 27. The seventh act of the evening was a piano recital—a\nperformance of Liszt’s ―Hungarian Fantasy No. 6‖—by a pianist named Liu Shikun. Today, Liu\nis regarded as China’s finest pianist; he has performed worldwide, including with Seiji Ozawa\nand the Boston Symphony for one of the best-selling classical music albums of all time. He had\ngiven his premiere performance at the age of 5. In 1949, at the age of 10, he had won the Chinese\nNational Competition for Teenagers and Children. In 1956, at the age of 17, he was so brilliant in\nhis performances around the world that the Hungarian government presented him with a lock of\nLiszt’s hair. He was a boy wonder, a musical genius who won innumerable international\ncompetitions worldwide.\nIf you read Liu’s official Chinese biography, you will note that ―he has performed in front of\nseveral generations of Chinese statesmen, including Mao Zedong … Deng Xiaoping, Jiang\nZemin and Hu Jintao.‖ What it does not tell you is that he was imprisoned during the Cultural\nRevolution and, we were told, maintained his skills by carving a keyboard on the wall of his cell\nand playing it day after day, hearing its music only in his imagination. His performance for us\nthat February evening in 1979 was one of his first public appearances since his ―rehabilitation,‖\nand it was so stirring that even our Chinese hosts were moved to tears.\n3\n\n\fWhenever I contemplate China’s capacity to succeed in the global economy, I think of those first\nimpressions of China of 30 years ago—the paucity of automobiles and the absence of computers;\nthe determination of Deng Xiaoping to harness the best talent and techniques from all over the\nworld; the example of the triumph over misguided policy that is embodied in the spirit and\ngenius of Liu Shikun. And I conclude that as long as China continues to constructively engage\nthe rest of the world and allow the tremendous talent of the Chinese people to flourish, the\nPeople’s Republic will not only be able to withstand the setbacks currently afflicting the global\neconomy, but will continue to advance its standing as an economic juggernaut.\nOf course, in a globalized economy, we are all interdependent. To prosper, China needs and\nexpects the largest economy of the world to overcome its economic and financial travails and\nlead the way to a global economic recovery. So let me now give you a briefing on the current\nU.S. situation.\nThe Present Situation\nThe data from the United States are grim. Our economy contracted at an annual rate of 6.3\npercent in the fourth quarter of last year. I expect that when the numbers are properly tallied, we\nwill have again contracted at a dispiriting rate in the quarter just ended. Unemployment is rising.\nWe currently have roughly 13.2 million people without jobs, which equates to an unemployment\nrate of 8.5 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to continue rising to a level that could\nsurpass 10 percent by year-end. Even in Texas, the most dynamic of the American states and the\nonly large province in the U.S. to create jobs last year, we expect unemployment to rise, though\nnot to national levels.\nAmong other things, this has compounded the problem of the much-watched housing market,\nwhere many of the problems we have encountered in our financial markets germinated: The most\nrecent release of the Case-Shiller index reveals that home price declines accelerated in the 20\nmetropolitan districts tracked. Prices fell 19 percent on a year-over-year basis for the threemonth period ended in January. But the problem with our economy is more pervasive. The men\nand women who operate our businesses and create and sustain employment have assumed an\nuncharacteristic defensive crouch. Confronted by dyspeptic financial markets, they are doing the\nbest they can to preserve their margins by cutting costs (most significantly, the cost of labor), and\nrunning tight inventories, rationalizing supply lines, deferring all but the most necessary capital\nexpenditures and, in general, avoiding risk. The result is an American economy in stasis.\nPresently, nothing is being ventured, and nothing is being gained.\nOf course, not helping matters is the implosion of our export markets, which are vital to the\ngrowth of an economy positioned to sell high-value-added goods and services—as well as\nagricultural and other basic goods—to others. The World Bank is predicting that global trade\nwill contract by 6.1 percent in 2009.2 The WTO is forecasting a 9 percent contraction.3 This will\nbe the first time since the 1940s that we have witnessed such a deep and synchronized\n\n2\n\n―As Global Economy Deteriorates, World Bank Predicts Sharply Slower Growth in Developing World in 2009;\nWeak Recovery in 2010,‖ World Bank Press Release No. 2009/285/DEC, March 31, 2009.\n3\n―WTO Sees 9% Global Trade Decline in 2009 as Recession Strikes,‖ World Trade Organization Press Release No.\nPress/554, March 23, 2009.\n4\n\n\fretrenchment of global economic activity, and this makes tougher the task of growing the U.S.\neconomy.\nOne of our founding fathers, James Madison, considered to be the father of the (American)\nConstitution, wrote that ―the circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.‖ 4\nThere is presently a palpable lack of circulating confidence in the business community in\nAmerica. Only when confidence is restored will the U.S. economy begin to grow again.\nCapital is the basis of capitalism. Without efficiently operating credit markets, the muscles of the\neconomic body—private businesses that produce goods and services and employ workers and are\nthe engines of prosperity—cannot function. Thus, the Federal Reserve has assumed a\ndramatically proactive and highly innovative role in seeking to restore vibrancy in the credit\nmarkets while stemming economic decline. This is an unaccustomed thing for our central bank.\nOrdinarily, the men and women of the Federal Reserve are the most shy and modest of economic\nagents. We prefer to move incrementally rather than exponentially, and we have historically\ntreasured conducting our deliberations quietly and away from the public limelight. But\nconfronted with a dysfunctional financial market and an implosion in our economy, in rapid\norder we have undertaken a series of very visible and widely broadcast initiatives. Over a period\nof a little more than a year, we:\n—Established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral\nto secure those loans;\n—Initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners,\nranging from the Bank of Japan to the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to the\nBanco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Korean Central Bank, to\nprovide these foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar funding to financial\ninstitutions in their jurisdictions. We also have put in place swap agreements with four of our\ncounterparts—the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss\nNational Bank—to enable the Federal Reserve to provide up to 10 trillion yen, 80 billion euro,\n30 billion in sterling and 40 billion in Swiss franc liquidity to U.S. financial institutions as a\nreciprocal prophylactic measure;\n—Created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds;\n—Initiated new measures in cooperation with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation to strengthen the security of certain banks;\n—Undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the\nfinancial system;\n—Began to pay interest on bank reserves;\n—Announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie\nMae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, then increased that sum to $200 billion;\n\n4\n\nSpeech in the Virginia Ratifying Convention on the Judicial Power, June 20, 1788.\n5\n\n\f—Announced we would buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie,\nFreddie and Ginnie Mae, then increased that sum to $1.25 trillion;\n—Announced, and just recently fleshed out, a new facility to support the issuance of assetbacked securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans\nguaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility that we have since stated we were\nprepared to expand significantly to other types of securities and beyond our originally planned\n$200 billion to $1 trillion; and\n—Began the process of purchasing up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the\nnext six months to help improve conditions in private credit markets.\nAnd, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the fed funds rate to\nbetween zero and one-quarter of 1 percent. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge\nbanks to borrow from our discount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. As of today, the total\nfootings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—more than a twofold\nincrease from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we will grow our balance sheet even more\nas we complete our programs of purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of\nmortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed\npaper.\nBy being so proactive in straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly shortterm Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate,\nwe have raised a few eyebrows. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough\nroad. We are the central bank of the largest economy in the world, and we are duty bound to\napply every tool we can to clean up the mess that our financial system has become and get back\non the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability.\nThis expansion of our balance sheet has given rise to concerns that we may be:\n1) Planting the seeds of future inflation; and\n2) Setting the stage for a demise of the dollar.\nI understand these concerns. Especially from a Chinese perspective. Just as the effects of the\narduous work and admirable thrift of the Chinese people are coming into fruition, your largest\nexport market and source of much investment—the United States—enters a bone-crushing\nrecession. And simultaneously, the largest and most liquid market for investing the hard-earned\nsavings and reserves you have accumulated have become extraordinarily volatile.\nIt would be only natural for your leaders to wonder if the remedies we are applying to treat our\neconomic pathology might eventually result in inflation and depreciation of the dollar.\nSo let me address each of these concerns in order.\n\n6\n\n\fFirst, with regard to the potential inflationary consequences of our actions: Our assignment is to\nconduct monetary policy so as to engender sustainable, noninflationary job growth. Presently,\nthe risk is deflationary job destruction. We have undertaken measures to counter that risk. And\nwe seek to do so in a way that will not ignite the embers of either a future destructive inflation or\na debasement of our currency.\nI have a reputation for being the most ―hawkish‖ participant in the deliberations of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee. I do not particularly like ornithological nomenclature—I would rather\nbe considered a wise owl (and I certainly do not wish to be anybody’s pigeon). But I have a\nrecord that substantiates that ―hawkish‖ reputation, having voted five times against monetary\naccommodation during the commodity-driven price boom of 2008. I consider inflation an evil\nspirit that rots the core of economic prosperity and must never, ever be countenanced. But it is\nclear to me that in this environment, inflation is unlikely to present a serious threat given the\npervasive bias in the U.S. economy toward wage cuts and freezes, rising unemployment, the\nwidespread loss in wealth that has resulted from both the housing and equity market corrections,\ncontinually declining consumption and business investment, and the anemic condition of the\nbanking and credit system, all of which reinforce downside price pressures in a global economy\ngroaning with excess capacity.\nFor as far ahead as I trust my forecasting ability5 (that is to say, the next couple of years), the\nproblem with regard to maintaining price stability most certainly is not inflation.\nWith regard to the fate of the dollar and the willingness of others to continue purchasing dollardenominated debt, we realize that by purchasing Treasuries in volumes and of durations that are\natypical, we are at risk of being perceived as monetizing the fiscal largesse of our Congress. And\nwe are acutely aware that by intervening in the mortgage-backed securities and other markets\nthat we are at risk of being perceived as blurring the lines between fiscal and monetary policy.\nWe realize that this may give rise to some apprehension among large holders of Treasuries and\nagency paper such as your government and others in the Asian-Pacific region.\nAnd yet, let me remind you that over the past year since we began in earnest the process of using\nthe new tools I have just articulated, the dollar has appreciated 17 percent against the euro and 29\npercent against the British pound. Against the major reserve currencies, the dollar has\ndepreciated against only one, the yen, and by 2 percent.\nHere are some numbers for you to contemplate: If a Chinese investor had purchased a threemonth U.S. Treasury bill in March 2008 and rolled it over every three months until the end of\nthis past month, the return would have been a negative 1.5 percent. That is hardly inspiring. But,\nhad that same investor purchased and rolled over a three-month euro-area central government\nbond, the investment would have resulted in a loss of 16 percent.\nI would add that a foreign investor who moved out on the Treasury yield curve would\nenjoyed superior returns to those just cited. In yuan terms, 10-year euro sovereigns would\nearned a return of negative 11.6 percent over the past year. The equivalent return would\nbeen a positive 9.5 percent for the Chinese investor in 10-year U.S. Treasuries. If I\n5\n\nhave\nhave\nhave\nmay\n\nI have never forgotten the admonition of one of my economics professors at Harvard—John Kenneth Galbraith—\nthat ―the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.‖\n7\n\n\fparaphrase Andrew Mellon, at least for the period over which the Fed has been applying its new\ntools, it has been quite true that ―gentlemen prefer American bonds.‖\nCertainly for the past year to date, fears of debasement of fixed-income portfolios invested in\ndollar-denominated public debt due to the profound actions taken by the Federal Reserve have\nproven unfounded.\nBut that is in the past. As to the future, the underlying math becomes more complex: The net new\nsupply of Treasury debt is predicted to expand by $2.5 trillion in the current fiscal year, versus\n$788 billion in the last fiscal year and only $145 billion in fiscal year 2007.6 All things being\nequal, this would result in a move upward in yield and downward in price, providing negative\nreturns absent any foreign exchange factor. But all things are not equal. For starters, the\nproblems facing the largest competitive currency, the euro, are perhaps even more substantial\nthan those confronting the United States. I will point to Spain as an example of a euro-area\neconomy that led the European pack on the upside and now is cascading rapidly downhill. In the\ncase of Japan, you are as aware as anybody of the economic and fiscal and political predicament\nthey are faced with; I will say no more. My point is that demand for Treasuries and other official\npaper of U.S. government issuers will be determined by their attractiveness relative to\nalternatives, and they may well be judged more, rather than less, attractive under most reasonable\nfuture scenarios.\nMoreover, both the fate of budget imbalances and the potential for total returns earned by\ninvesting in U.S. securities depend on the efficacy of the fiscal policies Congress has advanced.\nThese policies are designed to jump-start the economy while laying the groundwork for\npermanent structural reform. Time will tell if they achieve this multipurpose goal. If they do,\nthey will engender growth of the economy and concomitant confidence in both the fixed-income\nand equity markets for private securities. In addition, tax flows will be restored and confidence\nboosted in the path of deficit reduction envisioned by the current administration in its budget\nprojections. If these policies don’t jump-start the economy, then I am confident that the reaction\nwithin fixed-income markets will force those with the power to tax and spend, the Congress, to\nreadjust their fiscal policies.\nI offer as evidence the revelation that came to the fiercely partisan Democratic operative James\nCarville during the Clinton administration. He said that were he to be reincarnated and wished to\nbe the most powerful of all, he would come back not as a president or emperor or pope but as the\nbond market, for ―[the bond market] can intimidate anybody.‖7 I suspect this respect for the\npower of bond markets remains true for the Obama administration and the current Congress.\nOf course, to maintain price stability and faith in the dollar, we must maintain the independence\nof our central bank, the Federal Reserve. The dangers that arise when monetary authorities\nbecome the handmaidens of political authorities are documented in countless historical\nexamples—from the fall of ancient Rome to the Weimar Republic in Germany to the Nationalist\nChinese government in the 1940s to modern Zimbabwe. In 2013, we will celebrate our 100th\nanniversary as the central bank of the United States. We are not as established as an ongoing\nentity as the Bank of England, nor as young as institutions such as the People’s Bank of China.\n6\n7\n\n―Fed Home Loan Purchases Fail to Keep Mortgage Rates from Rising,‖ Financial Times, Feb. 9, 2009.\nJames Carville, as quoted in the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 25, 1993.\n8\n\n\fThis is not to say we are superior or always exemplary, but we are an elder in this business. We\nseek to be worthy of the veneration traditionally given to an elder. To this end, we must\nzealously guard our ongoing independence.\nWe have recently agreed with the U.S. Treasury to an accord to work together to support the\ngoals of preserving both monetary and financial stability.8 In this endeavor, it is the Federal\nReserve’s job to maintain monetary stability, while the Treasury will enable the Fed to sterilize\nthe impacts of its lending and securities purchases on its balance sheet—and on the balance sheet\nof the banking system. In essence, the Federal Reserve will not monetize the growth of the assets\non its balance sheet that has been, and will continue to be, necessary to jump-start the credit\nmarkets that are so essential to the recovery of the U.S. and global economies. To put it another\nway, the Federal Reserve is in the process of acquiring the tools to short-circuit any inflationary\nconsequences of its balance sheet growth.\nIn contemplating the future of the American economy and our ability to overcome our current\nfinancial predicament, I take great comfort in knowing that we have been faced with far tougher\ntasks and have always accomplished them. It is true that we Americans often confront storms of\nour making. We occasionally falter and get blown off course. But we never give up. And we\nalways come roaring back stronger, leaner and more efficient than we were before. For 233\nyears, the people of the United States have demonstrated that they are masters of the process of\ncreative destruction that economist Joseph Schumpeter articulated as the key to success for any\neconomy, be it built upon Anglo-American or Asian-Pacific or any other principles.\nOur recent presidential election demonstrates that we are still possessed of a vibrancy and\nadaptability that the French social philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville found so inspiring in the\nearly 19th century. As an American, I may be insufficiently humble—humility is, after all,\nanathema to Texans—but I think it reasonable to consider our track record and our adaptability\nto be the stuff of an eventual recovery that will take my country to new levels of prosperity. I am\nconfident that the innovative policies being pursued by the Federal Reserve will facilitate and,\nindeed, expedite the recovery process. In doing so, we will serve not only the interests of the\nUnited States but also those of China. For without restoration of American prosperity, China\ncannot realize the successful accomplishment of the course I personally witnessed Deng\nXiaoping initiate—a course his successors have so assiduously built upon and are working so\nhard to complete.\nNow, in the tradition that is the hallmark of central bankers everywhere, I will do my utmost to\navoid answering any questions you may have. That’s a joke. I will be glad to answer questions in\na straightforward manner for as long as you wish to ask them.\n\n8\n\nFederal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury Joint Press Release, March 23, 2009.\n9\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nTokyo, Japan\nApril 8, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Economic Situation of the United States\nand the Federal Reserve’s Response\nRichard W. Fisher\n\n1\n\nI hope I said that better than my son James, who, upon our family’s arrival in Tokyo in 1990,\npromptly spoke his first Japanese words:\n,\nwhich turned out to mean: ―My dog has a very long snout.‖\nDomo. Thank you. I am delighted to be here, together with my colleague Mark Wynne, who is\nthe director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute.\nI first came to Japan with President Carter for the G-7 Summit hosted by Prime Minister Ohira in\nJune of 1979. That experience whetted my appetite for Japanese culture. So after I returned to the\nprivate sector and had established an investment management firm in Dallas, I came back with\nmy family to reside in Tokyo under the aegis of the Japan Society for most of 1990—arriving\nhere shortly after the Nikkei Dow reached its all-time peak of 38,915. This gave me an\ninvaluable opportunity to simultaneously learn about your country while providing my\ncolleagues at Fisher Capital Management in Dallas insights into a financial market reversal of\nepic proportions—insights gleaned from an office kindly provided me by Nomura Research as\nwell as from the bleachers on the various baseball fields where my teenage son played for the\nMinato Moose team in the Tokyo Senior Boys Spring League.2\nSeven years later, I rejoined the government and served President Clinton as deputy U.S. trade\nrepresentative in numerous bilateral negotiations with your government. I also served as cochair\nwith Deputy Foreign Minister Haraguchi of the multiyear, joint commission set up by Prime\nMinister Hashimoto and President Clinton on deregulation and competition. In this commission,\nwe wrestled with everything from laws governing retail stores to electricity distribution to bid\nrigging in construction to financial deregulation and even what I referred to then as ―mini-micro‖\nissues—ranging from auditing standards to regulations governing law firms. I consider it a\nsignificant accomplishment for both sides that, today, one of the few issues from that agenda that\nremain unresolved is the matter of providing a level playing field for private insurance\n1\n\n―My name is Richard Fisher. I work for a bank.‖\nThat experience served our firm well. In 1990, we eked out a return of 0.6 percent versus a decline of 3.1 percent\nfor the total return of the S&P 500 and a decline of 34.8 percent in the dollar equivalent of the Nikkei’s total return.\nThis set the stage for a 59.7 percent return in 1991 versus 31percent in the S&P 500 and 3.6 percent in the dollar\nequivalent of the Nikkei’s total return—and anchored a run that, until I sold the firm in 1997, exceeded the return of\nthe S&P 500 by almost 2 to 1. In this sense, I owe my personal financial security to lessons learned in Japan.\n2\n\n1\n\n\fcompanies as they seek to compete with Japan Post Life Insurance, which like the rest of the\nPostal Savings system is now in a 10-year process of privatization.\nToday I have the honor of speaking to you in another capacity—as a representative of the central\nbank of the United States in my role as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, one of\nthe Federal Reserve’s 12 operating banks.\nEach of the bank presidents participates in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the\nbody that sets monetary policy for the United States. The tradition of the Federal Reserve is that\neach member of the FOMC speaks only for himself or herself. I shall adhere to that tradition\ntoday. The observations I will offer today are my own and should be interpreted as a view only\nfrom the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas—nothing more.\nI have been fortunate to see both my own country and yours from several perspectives. I have\nlearned enough about Japan from my different experiences here and my amateur study of\nJapanese history and literature to know that I do not know much. The first Western interpretation\nof Japan that I remember taking to heart was that of Lafcadio Hearn, who wrote of ―the immense\ndifficulty of perceiving and comprehending what underlies the surface of Japanese life.‖3 I have\nworked with your government on trade issues, operated an investment fund from Tokyo,\nwatched innumerable Japanese baseball games (I confess, at great risk in this audience of likely\nGiants fans, to being a fan of the Yakult Swallows, and even though they haven’t won a\nchampionship since 2001, I am hoping this 40th anniversary season for their franchise will be\ntheir lucky charm), read and re-read the classic works of Western interpreters like Hearn and\n[Edwin] Reischauer and [Karel] van Wolferen (and, my favorite as a baseball fan, Robert\nWhiting!) and studied the works of literary giants like Natsume Soseki and Tanizaki Jun’ichiro.4\nBut I have barely scratched the surface of comprehending your rich and complex culture. These\nexperiences have taught me enough, however, to be humble when addressing a Japanese\naudience of this distinction. So rather than prescribe policy to you, I will stick to describing the\npolicy predicaments in which my own countrymen and women are immersed.\nOne of my favorite books in Japanese literature is Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro, a gorgeous novel\nwritten in 1914, two years after the death of the Emperor Meiji and two years before the author’s\nown death. Lafcadio Hearn offered what seems to me to be the best translation of the word\nkokoro—he defined it as ―the heart of things.‖ In this lecture, I shall try to quickly get to the\nheart of things occurring in the U.S. economy. I will then summarize the consequences for U.S.\nmonetary policy. And then, if you permit me, I will endeavor to answer any questions you might\nhave. Throughout, I will do my best to achieve the stylistic simplicity that Soseki-san achieved in\nKokoro, though undoubtedly without the beauty that is implicit in that novel, for there is little of\napparent beauty in our current economic and financial situation.\nThe data from the United States are grim. Our economy contracted at an annual rate of 6.3\npercent in the fourth quarter of last year. I expect that when the numbers are properly tallied, we\nwill have contracted at a very similar rate in the quarter just ended. Unemployment is rising. We\ncurrently have roughly 13.2 million people without jobs, which equates to an unemployment rate\n3\n\nJapan: An Attempt at Interpretation, by Lafcadio Hearn, Charles E. Tuttle & Co., 1959, p.1.\nTwo exemplary works by Tanizaki Jun’ichiro are Naomi, Alfred A. Knopf Inc., 1985, and In Praise of Shadows,\nLeete’s Island Books Inc., 1977.\n4\n\n2\n\n\fof 8.5 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to continue rising to a level that could surpass 10\npercent by year-end. Among other things, this has compounded the problem of the muchwatched housing market, where many of the problems we have encountered in our financial\nmarkets germinated: The most recent release of the Case-Shiller index reveals that home price\ndeclines accelerated in the 20 metropolitan districts tracked, falling 19 percent on a year-overyear basis for the three-month period ended in January. But the problem with our economy is\nmore pervasive. The men and women who operate our businesses and create and sustain\nemployment have assumed a defensive crouch. Confronted by dyspeptic financial markets, they\nare doing the best they can to preserve their margins by cutting costs (most significantly, the cost\nof labor), and running tight inventories, rationalizing supply lines, deferring all but the most\nnecessary capital expenditures and, in general, avoiding risk. The result is an American economy\nin stasis. Nothing is being ventured, and nothing is being gained.\nOf course, not helping matters is the implosion of our export markets, which are vital to the\ngrowth of an economy positioned to sell high-value-added goods and services—as well as\nagricultural and other basic goods—to others. The World Bank is predicting that the global\neconomy will contract by 1.7 percent this year, and global trade by 6.1 percent. 5 This will be the\nfirst time since the 1940s that we have witnessed such a deep and synchronized retrenchment of\nglobal economic activity, and this makes tougher the task of growing the U.S. economy.\nOne of our founding fathers, James Madison, a coauthor of the Federalist Papers and considered\nby many to be the father of the (American) Constitution, wrote that ―the circulation of\nconfidence is better than the circulation of money.‖6 There is presently a palpable lack of\ncirculating confidence in the business community in America.\nIn light of this, the Federal Reserve has assumed a dramatically proactive and highly innovative\nrole in seeking to restore vibrancy in the credit markets while stemming economic decline. This\nis an unaccustomed thing for our central bank. Ordinarily, the men and women of the Federal\nReserve are the most shy and modest of economic agents. We prefer to move incrementally\nrather than exponentially, and we have historically treasured conducting our deliberations quietly\nand away from the public limelight. But confronted with a dysfunctional financial market and an\nimplosion in our economy, in rapid order we have undertaken a series of very visible and widely\nbroadcast initiatives. Over a period of a little more than a year, we:\n—Established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral\nto secure those loans;\n—Initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners,\nranging from the Bank of Japan to the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to the\nBanco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Korean Central Bank, to\nprovide these foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar funding to financial\ninstitutions in their jurisdictions. We also have put in place swap agreements with four of our\ncounterparts—the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss\nNational Bank—to enable the Federal Reserve to provide up to 10 trillion yen, 80 billion euro,\n5\n\n―As Global Economy Deteriorates, World Bank Predicts Sharply Slower Growth in Developing World in 2009;\nWeak Recovery in 2010,‖ World Bank Press Release No. 2009/285/DEC, March 31, 2009.\n6\nSpeech in the Virginia Ratifying Convention on the Judicial Power, June 20, 1788.\n3\n\n\f30 billion in sterling and 40 billion in Swiss franc liquidity to U.S. financial institutions as a\nreciprocal prophylactic measure;\n—Created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds;\n—Initiated new measures in cooperation with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp. to strengthen the security of certain banks;\n—Undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the\nfinancial system;\n—Began to pay interest on bank reserves;\n—Announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie\nMae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, then increased that sum to $200 billion;\n—Announced we would buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie,\nFreddie and Ginnie Mae, then increased that sum to $1.25 trillion;\n—Announced, and just recently fleshed out, a new facility to support the issuance of assetbacked securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans\nguaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility which we have since stated we were\nprepared to expand significantly to other types of securities and beyond our originally planned\n$200 billion to $1 trillion; and\n—Began the process of purchasing up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the\nnext six months to help improve conditions in private credit markets.\nAnd, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter\nof 1 percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate inflationary\ntide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and again in a\nseries of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge banks to borrow from our\ndiscount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. As of today, the total\nfootings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—more than a twofold\nincrease from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we will grow our balance sheet even more\nas we complete our programs of purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of\nmortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed\npaper.\nBy being so proactive in straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly shortterm Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate,\nwe have raised a few eyebrows. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough\nroad. We are the central bank of the largest economy in the world, and we are duty bound to\napply every tool we can to clean up the mess that our financial system has become and get back\non the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability.\n4\n\n\fThis expansion of our balance sheet has given rise to concerns that we may be:\n1) Planting the seeds of future inflation;\n2) Setting the stage for a demise of the dollar; and\n3) Placing the cherished independence of the Federal Reserve at risk.\nI understand these concerns. And I have actively and loudly argued during deliberations of the\nFOMC that these risks represent a real and present danger. But I am here to tell you that I am not\nalone. The committee members—from the regional bankers like me to its chairman, Ben\nBernanke, and other governors—are each and every one determined not to violate the basic\ntenets of Federal Reserve sanctity.\nLet me address each of these concerns in order.\nFirst, with regard to the potential inflationary consequences of our actions: Our assignment is to\nconduct monetary policy so as to engender sustainable, noninflationary job growth. Presently,\nthe risk is deflationary job destruction. We have undertaken measures to counter that risk. And\nwe seek to do so in a way that will not ignite the embers of either a future destructive inflation or\na debasement of our currency.\nI have a reputation for being the most ―hawkish‖ participant in the deliberations of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, and I have a record that substantiates that reputation, having voted five\ntimes against further accommodation during the commodity-driven price boom of 2008. I\nconsider inflation an evil spirit that rots the core of economic prosperity and must never, ever be\ncountenanced. But it is clear to me that in this environment, inflation is unlikely to present a\nserious threat given the pervasive bias in the U.S. economy toward wage cuts and freezes, rising\nunemployment, the widespread loss in wealth that has resulted from both the housing and equity\nmarket corrections, continually declining consumption and business investment, and the anemic\ncondition of the banking and credit system, all of which reinforce downside price pressures in a\nglobal economy groaning with excess capacity.\nFor as far ahead as I trust my forecasting ability (that is to say, the next couple of years), the\nproblem with regard to maintaining price stability most certainly is not inflation.\nWith regard to the fate of the dollar and the willingness of others to continue purchasing dollardenominated debt, we realize that by purchasing Treasuries in volumes and of durations that are\natypical, we are at risk of being perceived as monetizing the fiscal largesse of our Congress. And\nwe are acutely aware that by intervening in the mortgage-backed securities and other markets\nthat we are at risk of being perceived as blurring the lines between fiscal and monetary policy.\nWe realize that this may give rise to some apprehension among large holders of Treasuries and\nagency paper such as your government and others in the Asian Pacific region.\nAnd yet, let me remind you that over the past year since we began in earnest the process of using\nthe new tools I have just articulated, the dollar has appreciated 17 percent against the euro and 29\npercent against the British pound. Among the major currencies, the dollar has depreciated against\nonly one currency, Japan’s, and by 2.4 percent.\n\n5\n\n\fHere are some numbers for you to contemplate: If a Japanese investor had purchased a threemonth U.S. Treasury bill in March 2008 and rolled it over every three months until the end of\nthis past month, the return would have been slim to none—about –1.4 percent. That is hardly\ninspiring. But, had that same investor purchased and rolled over a three-month euro-area central\ngovernment bond, the investment would have resulted in a loss of 16 percent. A Chinese investor\ninvesting in euro bonds would have had the same experience. A Korean investor investing in the\nsame manner would have earned a return of 21 percent in euros but would have earned a 42\npercent return in won terms had he invested in three-month Treasury bills.\nCertainly for the past year to date, fears of debasement of fixed-income portfolios invested in\ndollar-denominated public debt have proven unfounded. To be sure, an investment in comparable\nmaturities in yen would have earned a modest positive return of 0.47 percent for a Japanese\ninvestor. But, adjusted for liquidity, that is hardly sufficient incentive for not having a\npredominance of the world’s most significant currency in a portfolio.\nI would add that a foreign investor who moved out on the Treasury yield curve would have\nenjoyed superior returns to those just cited. In yen terms, 10-year sovereign Japanese paper\nearned a return of 2 percent from March of 2008 to March of this year. Ten-year euro sovereigns\nwould have earned a return of negative 11.5 percent in yen terms. The equivalent return would\nhave been a positive 10.4 percent for the Japanese investor in 10-year U.S. Treasuries. If I may\nparaphrase Andrew Mellon, at least for the period over which the Fed has been applying its new\ntools, it has been quite true that ―gentlemen prefer American bonds.‖\nBut that is in the past. As to the future, the underlying math becomes more complex: The net new\nsupply of Treasury debt is predicted to expand by $2.5 trillion in the current fiscal year, versus\n$788 billion in the last fiscal year and only $145 billion in fiscal year 2007.7 All things being\nequal, this would result in a move upward in yield and downward in price, providing negative\nreturns absent any foreign exchange factor. But all things are not equal. For starters, the\nproblems facing the largest competitive currency, the euro, are perhaps even more substantial\nthan those confronting the United States. I will point to Spain and Ireland as examples of euroarea economies that led the European pack on the upside and now are cascading rapidly\ndownhill. In the case of Japan, you are as aware as anybody of the economic and fiscal and\npolitical predicament you are faced with; I will say no more. My point is that demand for\nTreasuries and other official paper of U.S. government issuers will be determined by their\nattractiveness relative to alternatives, and they may well be judged more, rather than less,\nattractive under most reasonable future scenarios.\nMoreover, both the fate of budget imbalances and the potential for total returns earned by\ninvesting in U.S. securities depend on the efficacy of the fiscal policies Congress has advanced.\nThese policies are designed to jump-start the economy while laying the groundwork for\npermanent structural reform. Time will tell if they achieve this multipurpose goal. If they do,\nthey will engender economic growth and concomitant confidence in the fixed-income and equity\nmarkets for private securities. In addition, tax flows will be restored and confidence boosted in\nthe path of deficit reduction envisioned by the current administration in its budget projections. If\nthese policies don’t jump-start the economy, then I am confident that the reaction within fixed-\n\n7\n\n―Fed Home Loan Purchases Fail to Keep Mortgage Rates from Rising,‖ Financial Times, Feb. 9, 2009.\n6\n\n\fincome markets will force those with the power to tax and spend, the Congress, to readjust their\nfiscal policies.\nI offer as evidence the revelation that came to the fiercely partisan Democratic operative James\nCarville during the Clinton administration. He said that were he to be reincarnated and wished to\nbe the most powerful of all, he would come back not as a president or a pope but as the bond\nmarket, for ―[the bond market] can intimidate anybody.‖8 I suspect this respect for the power of\nbond markets remains true for the Obama administration and the current Congress.\nAs to the independence of the Federal Reserve, let me remind you that in 2013, we will celebrate\nour 100th anniversary as the central bank of the United States. We are not as established as an\nongoing entity as the Bank of England, nor as young as institutions such as the People’s Bank of\nChina. This is not to say we are superior or always exemplary, but we are an elder in this\nbusiness. We seek to be worthy of the veneration traditionally given to an elder. To this end, we\nfeel it necessary to guard our ongoing independence.\nWe have recently agreed with the U.S. Treasury to an accord to work together to support the\ngoals of preserving both monetary and financial stability.9 In this endeavor, it is the Federal\nReserve’s job to maintain monetary stability, while the Treasury will enable the Fed to sterilize\nthe impacts of its lending and securities purchases on its balance sheet—and on the balance sheet\nof the banking system. In essence, the Federal Reserve will not monetize the growth of the assets\non its balance sheet that has been, and will continue to be, necessary to jump-start the credit\nmarkets that are so essential to the recovery of the U.S. and global economies. To put it another\nway, the Federal Reserve is in the process of acquiring the tools to short-circuit any inflationary\nconsequences of its balance sheet growth.\nIn contemplating the future of the American economy and our ability to overcome our current\nfinancial predicament, I take great comfort in knowing that we have faced far tougher tasks and\nhave always accomplished them. It is true that we Americans often confront storms of our\nmaking. We occasionally falter and get blown off course. But we never give up. And we always\ncome roaring back stronger, leaner and more efficient than we were before. For 233 years, the\npeople of the United States have demonstrated that they are masters of the process of creative\ndestruction that the economist Joseph Schumpeter articulated as the key to success for any\neconomy. Our recent presidential election demonstrates that we are still possessed of a vibrancy\nand adaptability that the French social philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville found so inspiring in\nthe early 19th century. As an American, I may be insufficiently humble, but I consider our track\nrecord and our adaptability the stuff of an eventual recovery that will take my country to new\nlevels of prosperity. I am confident that the innovative policies being pursued by the Federal\nReserve will facilitate and, indeed, expedite the recovery process.\nOne of the unique cultural artifacts that I found intriguing while I was here in Japan in 1990 was\nthe senninbari. For the Western press that is here, these are the ―thousand stitch cloths‖ that\noriginated during the Sino-Japanese War. By tradition, they consisted of a strip of white cloth\nembellished with 1,000 French stitches sewn with red thread by a thousand women and given to\nsoldiers to ward off bullets and ensure a safe return. There should be no doubt that we at the\n8\n9\n\nJames Carville, as quoted in the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 25, 1993.\nFederal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury joint press release, March 23, 2009.\n7\n\n\fFederal Reserve, like central bankers everywhere, are subject to attack by the bullets of a severe\nglobal recession and financial turbulence. Perhaps we could use senninbari to protect us. But as\nsymbolically and emotionally meaningful as they might have been, senninbari were no substitute\nfor prudent maneuvering on the battlefield. As part of the team working very hard to successfully\nmaneuver our central bank through the current financial battlefield, my colleagues and I are\ncommitted to the utmost to conducting monetary policy not only so as to ward off the bullets and\nother threats to our economy but to emerge from this stressful period with an American economy\nthat is stronger and better and that plays an important role in renewing the vibrancy of the global\neconomy.\nAnd now, in the tradition that is the hallmark of central bankers everywhere, I will do my best to\navoid answering any questions you may have.\nGoseichou arigato gozaimashita. Thank you very much.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDayton, Ohio\nMarch 26, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fExcerpts from “Comments on the Current Financial Crisis”\nRichard W. Fisher\nEnough of this dismal stuff.\nI want to now put on my hat as a former investor and address the purpose of this conference:\nidentifying investment strategies and opportunities.\nI opened with reference to Queen Elizabeth's \"annus horribilis.\" To be sure, 2008 might not have\nbeen the only \"annus horribilis\" we will have. It might well be extended to a biennium as we\nwork to untie the Gordian knot of the economic mess in which we find ourselves. However glum\nyou may feel, I remind you that the queen's reference was a play on words from a poem written\nin the year 1667 by John Dryden, titled \"Annus Mirabilis\"—the \"Year of Miracles\"—about the\nperiod of 1665 to 1666.\nGet this: The \"Year of Miracles\" that Dryden wrote about began with the Great Plague of\nLondon—a pandemic of something akin to bubonic plague—and ended with the Great Fire that\nburned London for five days.\nSo why did Dryden call it the \"Year of Miracles?\" Because from the wreckage, London rebuilt\nitself and arose from the ashes with wide streets, modern sewers and buildings commissioned by\nCharles II and designed by the great architect Christopher Wren that were so solidly constructed\nthey last to this day. Our task is to turn the current \"annus horribilis\" into an opportunity, just as\nthe Brits did 350 years ago—to emerge from the current economic wreckage stronger and better\nand more resilient than ever. If England could do it in the 17th century, we Americans, who face\na far lesser challenge and have never, ever flinched from staring down and overcoming adversity,\ncan certainly do it now. Turning something \"horribilis\" into a thing that is \"mirabilis\" is the\nAmerican thing to do.\nViewed from this perspective, the current economic and financial predicament represents a\npotential gold mine rather than a mine field. Historically, great investors have made their money\nby climbing a wall of worry rather than letting a woeful consensus cow them.\nHere is a take-home quote from Charles Mackay's classic tome Extraordinary Popular Delusions\nand the Madness of Crowds, written in 1841: \"Men think in herds … and they go mad in herds.\"\nJust as the astute investor should have resisted joining the thundering herd's mad euphoria, I\nsuggest you resist joining in the current stampede of despair.\nBe ever mindful of the power of economic Darwinism, of what the great economist Joseph\nSchumpeter called \"creative destruction.\"\nWhile today's economic equivalent of brontosaurus die a slow death or are eventually dismantled\nby regulators, new, more adaptable replacements will emerge. Your job as investors is to identify\nthe new, rather than mourn the old, to ferret out from the general market malaise good financial\nand business operators whose franchises and prospects are overdiscounted at current prices.\n1\n\n\fWere I you—were I in my old business of being a market operator and investor—I would be\nlicking my chops at the opportunities that always abound in times of adversity, while those who\ngot too big or too dysfunctional lick their wounds.\nIn the parlance of the trade, there are a lot of dollar bills that can be found in the debris of the\ncurrent markets that can be picked up for nickels and dimes.\nGo out and pick 'em up.\nThank you.\n\n2\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSmithfield, Rhode Island\nFebruary 24, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fComments on the Current Financial Crisis\nRichard W. Fisher\nI want to thank Matthew [O‘Rourke] for that poised and articulate introduction. You exemplify\nthe very best of Bryant [University], Matt. I also want to thank Ron Machtley for inviting me to\nspeak today. As Ron knows, for over 45 years, I have watched this university evolve through the\neyes of my brother, the chairman of your board of trustees, Mike Fisher. I know no other\nuniversity president in the nation who is as dynamic as Ron, and I thank him for his leadership.\nI also want to take advantage of being at this podium to single out my brother. It would be an\nunderstatement to say that Mike and I grew up in a difficult and tumultuous household. Mike\nwas always the voice of reason, always the leader by example, always the ―look-to‖ guy for me\nand our other brother, Bob. All the nice biographical things that Matthew said about me just now\nwould not have happened had I not wanted to grow up to be like my big brother. Thank you,\nMike, for being a bright, shining star and for showing me the way.\nNow to the economy and our current financial predicament. The most cogent description of\nrecent economic developments I have heard came from a woman who, having just commiserated\nwith her accountants, put it this way: ―This has been like the divorce from hell: My net worth has\nbeen cut in half and I‘m still stuck with my husband.‖ The mood and pace of the economy have\nshifted from near bliss to acrimony and an almost palpable sense of betrayal. Our self-confidence\nhas gone wobbly. Many of our fellow citizens feel trapped in an unsustainable situation. The\nchallenge facing President Obama is daunting.\nCertainly, few of us imagined in our wildest dreams that our global economy could have turned\nso rotten so quickly. Only yesterday, it appeared that the economy was cruising along in the most\ntranquil of seas. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of\neconomic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March of that year. And the stock\nmarket closed at an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day at\n1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing—most noticeably a heating up of\nheadline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of 2008. And\nthere were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably in the\nhousing market, but also on the balance sheets and income statements of major creditors and\nvarious consumers. But to the unsuspecting world, all was well.\nIn 2008, conditions shifted radically. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not\nbelabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product\nis no longer growing, but shrank at an annualized pace of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008,\na figure likely to be revised downward after greater scrutiny. Even Texas, the only large state in\nthe United States to have employment growth last year, saw its economy shrink in the fourth\nquarter. Abroad, the European Union‘s economy declined at an annualized rate of 5.8 percent,\nEngland‘s by 5.9 percent, Japan‘s by 12.7 percent and Korea‘s by 20.6 percent. And China‘s\ngrowth tapered down significantly to a reported year-over-year rate of 6.8 percent. Our closest\nneighbors saw their economies shift into reverse gear: Mexico‘s economy contracted, as did that\nof Canada, a net oil exporter with a surplus in its federal budget, low corporate and consumer\ndebt levels, and no apparent subprime mortgage problems.\n1\n\n\fLast Wednesday, we learned that U.S. industrial production declined by 1.8 percent in January\nand that overall manufacturing output has declined 12.9 percent over the past year. It is worse\nelsewhere. For example, Japanese industrial production is en route to declining by 30 percent this\nyear. For historical perspective, you may recall that in the classic 1954 film, Godzilla destroyed\nTokyo, which then represented roughly a third of Japan‘s industrial production. We might call\nthis the Godzilla Economy: It presents a monstrous challenge.\nThis challenge is vexing to bankers and other creditors. The credit intermediation process has\nbecome dysfunctional, and as for stocks, the S&P 500 Index has become historically and\nhysterically volatile; it closed yesterday roughly 52 percent off its October 2007 peak. British\nstocks were off 42 percent over the same period, the German DAX was down 51 percent, the\nHang Seng Index was down 53 percent and the Nikkei Dow for Japan is down 57 percent.\nI will not venture to predict the future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know\nthe consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with unforgiving stock and credit\nmarkets, American businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their\nproducts shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit\nmargins. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting ―head count‖ so aggressively that\nunemployment appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and possibly past, 9 percent.\nBusinesses are delaying capital expenditures. They are demanding that suppliers cut their prices\nand are tightening inventory management. They are watching their receivables and stretching out\ntheir payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (One of\nmy colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or\nmany other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed,\nwe must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal\nReserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it\ngrew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of\nthe art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the\nsenior officers.\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following, written by another wise man,\nprovides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a\nlong quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current\npredicament:\n―Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when ‗the credit\nsystem‘ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard\nof; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly\nfrom the facility of borrowing.\n―Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the\nbanks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade;\ngreat purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All,\n2\n\n\fto be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid\ncapital....\n―Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and\ncredulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example\nof one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n―Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician,\nand the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No ‗operation‘ is thought worthy of\nattention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does\nnot promise an immediate fortune....\n―Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as\nshort as it is brilliant.‖1\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street\nJournal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Ellen Goodman of the Boston Globe. It was\nwritten by Washington Irving in his famous ―Crayon Papers‖ about the Mississippi Bubble\nfiasco of 1719.\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the\nother modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had\nnever heard of Bernie Madoff or Allen Stanford. But he understood booms propelled by greed\nand tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called ―irrational exuberance‖ is\nreplaced by irrational fear—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the\nultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive\ncrouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he\nwould advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied, ―cash and fetal.‖)\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no\nbusiness appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers\nand begins to weaken.\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\nOf course, we could have let nature run its course for fear of making things worse. P. G.\nWodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to say that ―there is only one cure for gray hair. It\nwas invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.‖ But my colleagues at the Federal\nReserve and I refuse to be fatalistic. (Besides, those of us who still have hair have seen it turn\ngray this past year.) Though in normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus\nof the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell\nDoctrine: We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit\nstrategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to\neconomic stability.\n\n1\n\n―A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,‖ by Washington Irving, in The Crayon Papers, 1890.\n3\n\n\fLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the\neconomy‘s lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the 19th century by\ntwo men: Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\nBagehot‘s prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: ―The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the\nliabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‗this man and that man‘\nwhenever the security is good.‖\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its\ngovernor as follows: ―We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted\nbefore; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on\n[those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of\nexchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of\nthe Bank....‖2\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: ―It is by no\nmeans intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which\nthe rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so\n... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply\nto involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every\ndistressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their\nstate.‖3\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate\nbetween the need to ―advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and\nmerchants, and ‗to this man and that man‘ whenever the security is good‖ and the equally\ncompelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving ―those who misconduct their\nbusiness,‖ you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of\nrecent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours\nof the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the\ntheories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\nI recently read Ken Follett‘s magnificent book World Without End.4 It is a massive tome that\nruns for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black\nPlague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the\nintelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists\nof ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to\nattend Oxford, so they learned from doing.5 While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old\northodoxy of studying the ―humors,‖ of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua\n2\n\nLombard Street, by Walter Bagehot, 1873.\nAn Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, by Henry Thornton, 1802.\n4\nWorld Without End, by Ken Follett, New York: Penguin, 2007.\n5\nWhen I arrived at Oxford 650 years later, there were women studying there, but they were kept in separate colleges\nand were small in number. The joke among women then was ―Come to Oxford where the odds are good but the\ngoods are odd.‖\n3\n\n4\n\n\f(―Thy will be done‖), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The\npunch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the\nworst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and\nadapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\nWe at the Federal Reserve do not believe in the economic equivalent of ―fiat voluntas tua.‖ We\nbelieve in using our powers proactively. We have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then\nsome. We have been neither ―scanty nor slow‖ in addressing the pathology of our economy and\nfinancial system. We have ―lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the\nsafety of the bank.‖ And we have made abundantly clear that despite having reduced the target\nrange for the federal funds rate to the ―zero bound‖—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from\npursuing all practicable means available to a central bank in supporting the functioning of\nfinancial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state.\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient\ndebacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by\nother lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as\nthe Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the\nactions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to\ntheir banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12, 2007, when the base interest\nrate—the fed funds rate—was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing\naccess to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures\nin the system.\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We\nestablished a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to\nsecure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major\ntrading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco\nde México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those\nmarkets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the\nU.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain\nbanks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of\nthe financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new\nfacility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto\nloans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility\nwhich last week we stated we were prepared to expand significantly beyond our originally\nplanned $200 billion; and (8) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase\nup to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home\nLoan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie\nand Ginnie Mae.\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero\nand a quarter of 1 percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate\ninflationary tide was ebbing (though I remain concerned about the effects low rates have on\naging baby boomers and the elderly who played by the rules, saved and squirreled away money\nand are now earning meager returns on their fixed-income portfolios and bank deposits).\nSimultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and again in a series of steps, the\n5\n\n\fBoard of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our discount window so as\nto lower the cost of credit to the economy.\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve‘s balance sheet. As of Feb. 18, the total\nfootings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—an almost twofold\nincrease from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet\neven more should conditions warrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries,\nexpanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different\nforms of asset-backed paper.\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our\nbalance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value\nof our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. Simple accounting dictates that the\nexpansion of the left side of our balance sheet has been accompanied by an equally impressive\nexpansion of the right side—the liability side. In this regard, the combination of banks‘ balances,\nFederal Reserve Bank notes and U.S. Treasury balances has grown tremendously.\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the liability\nside of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash. The bulk of this accumulation\nwas associated with an increase in government securities on the left side of the Bank‘s balance\nsheet, which seemed to do little to rejuvenate the system.\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between\ncash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their\nmoney. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and allimportant private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to\naffordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to\nimprove the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In\nthe parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to\n―quantitative easing.‖ It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese\ncounterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others‘ unsuccessful attempts at\ncuring the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term\nTreasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we\nhave raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron\nsaint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devices his protagonist, the felicitously\nnamed Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn\nto Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein,\nit was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B),\nthereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting\nperch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens\nand lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut\nstring (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby\nwiping face.\n6\n\n\fI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter\nBagehot or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex,\ntrying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation‘s central bank and we are duty\nbound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial\nsystem and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men\nand women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform\ntheir duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\nTo be sure, we have to be very careful in deploying our arsenal. For example, we are well aware\nthat the issuance of new Treasuries is expanding at an eye-popping pace: Net new issuance of\nTreasuries was $145 billion in fiscal year 2007, expanded to $788 billion in fiscal year 2008 and,\nby most everyone‘s accounting, will broach $2 trillion in fiscal year 2009.6 This ―guesstimation‖\nis based on the pace of issuance in the first five months of this fiscal year and the expected price\ntag for the recently approved fiscal stimulus package (but before a net cost is assigned to the\nbank proposals that will be forthcoming from the Treasury and before accounting for the budget\nabout to be sent to the Congress by President Obama). The Federal Reserve must, of course, be\nvery careful to avoid any perception that it stands ready to monetize exploding fiscal deficits, as\nthis would undermine confidence in our independence and raise serious doubts about our\ncommitment to long-term price stability. These concerns certainly do not preclude some\nTreasuries purchases, however, as we seek to strengthen the economy in this time of crisis. With\nshort-term Treasury rates near zero, an argument can be made that buying longer-term Treasuries\nwould be especially effective in this regard.\nParenthetically, I would note that such purchases are not at all unusual. We routinely buy\nTreasury issues with a wide range of maturities in order to maintain a well-balanced portfolio.\nSo, we are talking only about a possible change in emphasis here, not a sharp departure from past\npractice. That said, in my opinion, we certainly shouldn‘t try to peg long-term rates. Past efforts\nto do so soon have led to costly credit-market distortions and inevitably ended in tears. In my\nview, we must be very careful not to provide for an unsustainable and potentially disruptive\ndistortion in the benchmark market for Treasuries through any extraordinary efforts above and\nbeyond our normal balancing operations.\nSimilarly, we must be very cautious about the dimensions of our program to intervene directly in\nthe market for asset-backed securities, making sure that our actions are the absolute minimum\nneeded, and no more. Most important of all, we must continue to make clear that we will unwind\nour interventions in the market and shrink our balance sheet back to normal proportions once our\ntask is accomplished, for this is, indeed, our unanimous and unflinching intention.\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun\nto work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym Libor, has come\ndown handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that\nwill be reset in the immediate future are based on Libor. Our purchase of government-sponsored\nenterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities helped reduce the interest rate on 30-year, fixedrate mortgages to a record low of 4.96 in mid-January, according to Freddie Mac data that start\nin 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer-term Treasuries has\nrisen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund\n6\n\n―Fed Home Loan Purchases Fail to Keep Mortgage Rates from Rising,‖ Financial Times, Feb. 9, 2009.\n7\n\n\ffacilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the\nA1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has\nalso not escaped my attention that the premium over Treasuries that investment-grade\ncorporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined by 20 percent and by 25 percent for\nnon-investment-grade borrowers and that corporate bond issuance has stepped up.\nDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed\nto restore the nation‘s economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and\nspending the American people‘s money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes\nhave been on the stimulus package recently passed by the House and Senate and signed by\nPresident Obama. This was no easy task, and it was accomplished with unusual alacrity. Only\ntime will tell if the stimulus will give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without\nencumbering or disincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term\neconomic miracle that is America. Next, our political leaders must agree to funding, if any, of the\nTreasury‘s proposals for the resolution of the banking crisis so as to make the system more stable\nand viable—a resolution, as Thomas Friedman reminds us in Sunday‘s New York Times, that\nneeds to be done in a manner that encourages winners rather than ―bailing out losers.‖7 And, on\ntop of all that, they must begin, now, to dig us out of the very deep hole they themselves have\ndug in incurring unfunded liabilities of retirement and health care obligations—programs that are\nalready on the books but have not yet been paid for—that Pete Peterson‘s foundation calculates\nat $53 trillion and we at the Dallas Fed believe total over $99 trillion.8 If you do the numbers,\nyou will find that some 85 percent of those unfunded liabilities is due to Medicare; a budgetary\nHeimlich maneuver is urgently needed to keep Medicare from choking off our economic\nprosperity.\nWe are navigating uncharted, financially treacherous waters. Our fiscal authorities must carefully\nplot a course between the immediate needs for stimulus and the future needs of our children and\ngrandchildren.\nWhen George Shultz was director of the Office of Management and Budget, he became\nfrustrated with the spending impulses of the Nixon administration. He reports that he called the\nvenerable Sam Cohen, a virtual encyclopedia of budgetary history, into his office and asked,\n―Between you and me, Sam, is there really any difference between Republicans and Democrats\nwhen it comes to spending money?‖ Cohen‘s reply was classic: ―Sir, there is only one difference:\nDemocrats enjoy it more.‖\nMr. Cohen might have been a more ―equal opportunity‖ wisecracker were he still around. No\nmatter. We are beyond the point of either party‘s placing its immediate political needs ahead of\nthe welfare of our children and successor generations. I am hopeful that the good people that\nPresident Obama has assembled to guide his economic policy, and the leadership of the House\nand Senate, will begin to prevail on Congress to finally begin filling in the gaping holes of\n7\n\n―Start Up the Risk-Takers,‖ by Thomas Friedman, New York Times, Feb. 22, 2009.\nFigures from the Dallas Fed cited in ―Storms on the Horizon,‖ by Richard W. Fisher, remarks before the\nCommonwealth Club of California, San Francisco, May 28, 2008. Figures from the Peterson Foundation cited in\n―Washington Must Heed Fiscal Alarm Bell,‖ by David Walker, Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Sept. 22, 2008.\n8\n\n8\n\n\funfunded liabilities. In my eyes, these unfunded programs represent the greatest threat to our\nlong-term economic welfare and—given the historical temptation for politicians to ask central\nbanks to monetize their profligacy—the independence of the Federal Reserve. Left unattended,\nthese liabilities will surely tear asunder future American prosperity.\nI trust Congress will get it right. And, in doing so, I trust that they—and you—will keep in mind\nboth the limited powers of the Federal Reserve and the vital importance of allowing us to apply\nour own judgment on how best to exercise those powers in furtherance of our mandate—a\nmandate to promote financial stability, maximize sustainable job creation, and maintain price\nstability.\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress,\nthere is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this\nfirsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was\nbut one instance in a long history that stretches from the debauching of monetary probity in\nancient Rome to the inflation disaster that is now modern Zimbabwe.\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of\nFischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it,\nhe notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the\nReichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck‘s closest confidant, Gershon\nBleichröder, is reported to have ―warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when\npolitical considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too\nindependent a central bank would be a nuisance.‖9\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to\noverride what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany‘s central bank led to\nthe hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I\nbeg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the\nindependence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political\nconsiderations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe\nharbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal\nReserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its\nsingular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a ―nuisance,‖ so be it. The Fed under Paul\nVolcker‘s leadership was certainly a ―nuisance,‖ but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone\nalive today who would argue the fact that the Volcker Fed pulled the nation from the precipice of\neconomic calamity. It is important that the Federal Reserve be left to do its job and no more.\nHaving drawn that line in the sand, let me conclude by offering a recommendation to our\nlawmakers: It is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism, including disguised\nprotectionism in the form of nontariff barriers, ―buy American‖ provisions and restrictions on\ncapital flows. What made the Great Depression ―great‖ was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which\neveryone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long Depression that\nbegan when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for municipal and\nresidential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the\nfinancial panic of 1873.\n9\n\nLords of Finance, by Liaquat Ahamed, New York: Penguin, 2009, p. 88.\n9\n\n\fIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global\ndownturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the\naforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany‘s\nfree trade policy. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin\nHarrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform.\nI have been quoted as saying that protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics.10 It provides a\ntemporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death. Were I not a\ntaciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global\ngrowth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives,\nnewly elected chief executive and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the\ntemptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the\neconomic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying ―Have a nice day!‖ and walking off the stage.\nHowever, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another\nsourpuss. I am, as I said, paid to worry. But I am a red-blooded American, as are all my\ncolleagues at the Fed. I draw on the wisdom of Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the\nFederal Reserve from a period when our economy endured an even greater ―stress test.‖ To\ncounter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial\nindustry after the Crash of ‘29, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\nFirst, he said: ―You‘re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.‖\nSecond: ―You‘re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.‖\nThird: ―You‘re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the\ncountry.‖\nAnd fourth: ―You‘re right if you bet that (leaders) in business, labor, and government are sane,\nreasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground\namong all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that\nconfront them.‖\nThis became known as ―Old Doc Nadler‘s Remedy,‖ and for my part, it is spot on. Every one of\nus preoccupied with what ails us should keep it in mind.\nI conclude where I started, with the example of my brother. It sounds trite, but to me, your\nchairman, Mike Fisher, is the embodiment of the principle that when the going gets tough, the\ntough get going. Against sometimes overwhelming odds, he lifted himself—and me alongside\nhim—up to great heights through sheer hard work and faith in the American Dream. It may seem\nlike the stuff of the wildest dreams to imagine our getting this economy out from its current\nnightmarish predicament. But I believe we can and we will. We are Americans. I believe deep in\nmy soul that when put to the test, Americans rise to the occasion, no matter how great the\nchallenge. We have done it time and again. We have no choice but to do it once more, now.\nI think I have said enough, if not too much. In the time-honored tradition of central bankers, I\nwould now be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\n10\n\nThe NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Feb. 2, 2009.\n10\n\n\f"

        "content": "Albert H. Gordon Lecture:\nComments on the Current Financial Crisis\nRemarks at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nFebruary 23, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fAlbert H. Gordon Lecture:\nComments on the Current Financial Crisis\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Dean [David] Ellwood. Nancy and I are proud of our almost 40-year involvement\nwith Harvard College and the Kennedy School and are especially grateful that our four children\nwere blessed with a Harvard education.\nI am delighted to see so many friends from our various stages of Harvard life here tonight. I am\ntremendously honored to give this Albert H. Gordon Lecture. Al Gordon is 105 years old and an\nexemplar to us all—especially to stock pickers. I am told that on his birthday five years ago, he\nquipped that, having reached 100, he was ―going to split, two for one.‖ The world would have\nbeen doubly enriched had he been able to do so.\nThis is humbling in more ways than one. Yesterday morning, as I got on the plane to fly up here,\nI turned to Nancy and said, ―In your wildest dreams did you ever envision me following in the\nfootsteps of George H. W. Bush, David Rockefeller and Ban Ki-moon in giving the Gordon\nLecture at the Kennedy School?‖ And she replied, ―I hate to let you down, Richard, but after 35\nyears of marriage, you rarely appear in my wildest dreams.‖\nCertainly, few of us imagined in our wildest dreams that our global economy could have turned\nso rotten so quickly. Only yesterday, it appeared that the economy was cruising along in the most\ntranquil of seas. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of\neconomic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March of that year. And the stock\nmarket closed at an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day at\n1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing—most noticeably a heating up of\nheadline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of 2008. And\nthere were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably in the\nhousing market but also on the balance sheets and income statements of major creditors and\nvarious consumers. But to the unsuspecting world, all was well.\nIn 2008, conditions shifted radically. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not\nbelabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product\nis no longer growing but shrank at an annualized pace of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008,\na figure likely to be revised downward after greater scrutiny. Even Texas, the only large state in\nthe United States to have employment growth last year, saw its economy shrink in the fourth\nquarter. Abroad, the European Union‘s economy declined at an annualized rate of 5.8 percent,\nEngland‘s by 5.9 percent, Japan‘s by 12.7 percent and Korea‘s by 20.6 percent. And China‘s\ngrowth tapered down significantly to a reported year-over-year rate of 6.8 percent. Our closest\nneighbors saw their economies shift into reverse gear: Mexico‘s economy contracted, as did that\nof Canada, a net oil exporter with a surplus in its federal budget, low corporate and consumer\ndebt levels, and no apparent subprime mortgage problems.\nLast Wednesday, we learned that U.S. industrial production declined by 1.8 percent in January\nand that overall manufacturing output has declined 12.9 percent over the past year. It is worse\n1\n\n\felsewhere. For example, Japanese industrial production is en route to declining by 30 percent this\nyear. For historical perspective, you may recall that in the classic 1954 film, Godzilla destroyed\nTokyo, which then represented roughly a third of Japan‘s industrial production. We might call\nthis the Godzilla Economy: It presents a monstrous challenge.\nThis challenge is vexing to bankers and other creditors. The credit intermediation process has\nbecome dysfunctional, and as for stocks, the S&P 500 Index has become historically and\nhysterically volatile; it closed today roughly 50 percent off its October 2007 peak. British stocks\nare off 40 percent over the same period, the German DAX is down 49 percent, the Hang Seng\nIndex is down 55 percent and the Nikkei Dow for Japan is down 57 percent.\nI will not venture to predict the future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know\nthe consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with unforgiving stock and credit\nmarkets, American businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their\nproducts shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit\nmargins. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting ―head count‖ so aggressively that\nunemployment appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and possibly past, 9 percent.\nBusinesses are delaying capital expenditures. They are demanding that suppliers cut their prices\nand are tightening inventory management. They are watching their receivables and stretching out\ntheir payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (One of\nmy colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or\nmany other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed,\nwe must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal\nReserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it\ngrew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of\nthe art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the\nsenior officers.\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following, written by another wise man,\nprovides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a\nlong quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current\npredicament:\n―Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when ‗the credit\nsystem‘ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard\nof; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly\nfrom the facility of borrowing.\n―Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the\nbanks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade;\ngreat purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All,\nto be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid\ncapital....\n2\n\n\f―Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and\ncredulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example\nof one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n―Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician,\nand the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No ‗operation‘ is thought worthy of\nattention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does\nnot promise an immediate fortune....\n―Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as\nshort as it is brilliant.‖1\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street\nJournal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Ellen Goodman of the Boston Globe. It was\nwritten by Washington Irving in his famous ―Crayon Papers‖ about the Mississippi Bubble\nfiasco of 1719.\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the\nother modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had\nnever heard of Bernie Madoff or Allen Stanford. But he understood booms propelled by greed\nand tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called ―irrational exuberance‖ is\nreplaced by irrational fear—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the\nultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive\ncrouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he\nwould advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied, ―cash and fetal.‖)\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no\nbusiness appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers\nand begins to weaken.\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\nOf course, we could have let nature run its course for fear of making things worse. P. G.\nWodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to say that ―there is only one cure for gray hair. It\nwas invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.‖ But my colleagues at the Federal\nReserve and I refuse to be fatalistic. (Besides, those of us who still have hair have seen it turn\ngray this past year.) Though in normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus\nof the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell\nDoctrine: We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit\nstrategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to\neconomic stability.\nLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the\neconomy‘s lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the 19th century by\ntwo men: Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\n\n1\n\n―A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,‖ by Washington Irving, in The Crayon Papers, 1890.\n3\n\n\fBagehot‘s prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: ―The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the\nliabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‗this man and that man‘\nwhenever the security is good.‖\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its\ngovernor as follows: ―We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted\nbefore; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on\n[those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of\nexchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of\nthe Bank....‖2\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: ―It is by no\nmeans intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which\nthe rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so\n... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply\nto involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every\ndistressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their\nstate.‖3\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate\nbetween the need to ―advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and\nmerchants, and ‗to this man and that man‘ whenever the security is good‖ and the equally\ncompelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving ―those who misconduct their\nbusiness,‖ you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of\nrecent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours\nof the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the\ntheories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\nI recently read Ken Follett‘s magnificent book World Without End.4 It is a massive tome that\nruns for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black\nPlague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the\nintelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists\nof ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to\nattend Oxford, so they learned from doing.5 While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old\northodoxy of studying the ―humors,‖ of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua\n(―Thy will be done‖), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The\npunch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the\nworst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and\nadapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\n2\n\nLombard Street, by Walter Bagehot, 1873.\nAn Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, by Henry Thornton, 1802.\n4\nWorld Without End, by Ken Follett, New York: Penguin, 2007.\n5\nWhen I arrived at Oxford 650 years later, there were women studying there, but they were kept in separate colleges\nand were small in number. The joke among women then was ―Come to Oxford where the odds are good but the\ngoods are odd.‖\n3\n\n4\n\n\fWe at the Federal Reserve do not believe in the economic equivalent of ―fiat voluntas tua.‖ We\nbelieve in using our powers proactively. We have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then\nsome. We have been neither ―scanty nor slow‖ in addressing the pathology of our economy and\nfinancial system. We have ―lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the\nsafety of the bank.‖ And we have made abundantly clear that despite having reduced the target\nrange for the federal funds rate to the ―zero bound‖—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from\npursuing all practicable means available to a central bank in supporting the functioning of\nfinancial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state.\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient\ndebacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by\nother lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as\nthe Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the\nactions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to\ntheir banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12, 2007, when the base interest\nrate—the fed funds rate—was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing\naccess to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures\nin the system.\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We\nestablished a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to\nsecure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major\ntrading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco\nde México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those\nmarkets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the\nU.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain\nbanks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of\nthe financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new\nfacility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto\nloans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility\nwhich last week we stated we were prepared to expand significantly beyond our originally\nplanned $200 billion; and (8) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase\nup to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home\nLoan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie\nand Ginnie Mae.\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero\nand a quarter of 1 percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate\ninflationary tide was ebbing (though I remain concerned about the effects low rates have on\naging baby boomers and the elderly who played by the rules, saved and squirreled away money\nand are now earning meager returns on their fixed-income portfolios and bank deposits).\nSimultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and again in a series of steps, the\nBoard of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our discount window so as\nto lower the cost of credit to the economy.\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve‘s balance sheet. As of today, the total\nfootings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to $1.75 trillion—an almost twofold increase\n5\n\n\ffrom when we started in 2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even\nmore should conditions warrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries,\nexpanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different\nforms of asset-backed paper.\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our\nbalance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value\nof our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. Simple accounting dictates that the\nexpansion of the left side of our balance sheet has been accompanied by an equally impressive\nexpansion of the right side—the liability side. In this regard, the combination of banks‘ balances,\nFederal Reserve Bank notes and U.S. Treasury balances has grown tremendously.\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the liability\nside of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash. The bulk of this accumulation\nwas associated with an increase in government securities on the left side of the Bank‘s balance\nsheet, which seemed to do little to rejuvenate the system.\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between\ncash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their\nmoney. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and allimportant private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to\naffordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to\nimprove the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In\nthe parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to\n―quantitative easing.‖ It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese\ncounterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others‘ unsuccessful attempts at\ncuring the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term\nTreasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we\nhave raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron\nsaint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devices his protagonist, the felicitously\nnamed Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn\nto Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein,\nit was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B),\nthereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting\nperch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens\nand lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut\nstring (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby\nwiping face.\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter\nBagehot or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex,\ntrying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation‘s central bank and we are duty\nbound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial\nsystem and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men\n6\n\n\fand women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform\ntheir duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\nTo be sure, we have to be very careful in deploying our arsenal. For example, we are well aware\nthat the issuance of new Treasuries is expanding at an eye-popping pace: Net new issuance of\nTreasuries was $145 billion in fiscal year 2007, expanded to $788 billion in fiscal year 2008 and,\nby most everyone‘s accounting, will broach $2 trillion in fiscal year 2009. 6 This ―guesstimation‖\nis based on the pace of issuance in the first five months of this fiscal year and the expected price\ntag for the recently approved fiscal stimulus package (but before a net cost is assigned to the\nbank proposals that will be forthcoming from the Treasury and before accounting for the budget\nabout to be sent to Congress by President Obama). The Federal Reserve must, of course, be very\ncareful to avoid any perception that it stands ready to monetize exploding fiscal deficits, as this\nwould undermine confidence in our independence and raise serious doubts about our\ncommitment to long-term price stability. These concerns certainly do not preclude some\nTreasuries purchases, however, as we seek to strengthen the economy in this time of crisis. With\nshort-term Treasury rates near zero, an argument can be made that buying longer-term Treasuries\nwould be especially effective in this regard.\nParenthetically, I would note that such purchases are not at all unusual. We routinely buy\nTreasury issues with a wide range of maturities in order to maintain a well-balanced portfolio.\nSo, we are talking only about a possible change in emphasis here, not a sharp departure from past\npractice. That said, in my opinion, we certainly shouldn‘t try to peg long-term rates. Past efforts\nto do so soon have led to costly credit-market distortions and inevitably ended in tears. In my\nview, we must be very careful not to provide for an unsustainable and potentially disruptive\ndistortion in the benchmark market for Treasuries through any extraordinary efforts above and\nbeyond our normal balancing operations.\nSimilarly, we must be very cautious about the dimensions of our program to intervene directly in\nthe market for asset-backed securities, making sure that our actions are the absolute minimum\nneeded, and no more. Most important of all, we must continue to make clear that we will unwind\nour interventions in the market and shrink our balance sheet back to normal proportions once our\ntask is accomplished, for this is, indeed, our unanimous and unflinching intention.\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun\nto work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym Libor, has come\ndown handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that\nwill be reset in the immediate future are based on Libor. Our purchase of government-sponsored\nenterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities helped reduce the interest rate on 30-year, fixedrate mortgages to a record low of 4.96 in mid-January, according to Freddie Mac data that start\nin 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer-term Treasuries has\nrisen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund\nfacilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the\nA1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has\nalso not escaped my attention that the premium over Treasuries that investment-grade\ncorporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined by 20 percent and by 25 percent for\nnon-investment-grade borrowers and that corporate bond issuance has stepped up.\n6\n\n―Fed Home Loan Purchases Fail to Keep Mortgage Rates from Rising,‖ Financial Times, Feb. 9, 2009.\n7\n\n\fDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed\nto restore the nation‘s economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and\nspending the American people‘s money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes\nhave been on the stimulus package recently passed by the House and Senate and signed by\nPresident Obama. This was no easy task, and it was accomplished with unusual alacrity. Only\ntime will tell if the stimulus will give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without\nencumbering or disincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term\neconomic miracle that is America. Next, our political leaders must agree to the funding, if any, of\nthe Treasury‘s proposals for the resolution of the banking crisis so as to make the system more\nstable and viable—a resolution, as Thomas Friedman reminds us in Sunday‘s New York Times,\nthat needs to be done in a manner that encourages winners rather than ―bailing out losers.‖7 And,\non top of all that, they must begin, now, to dig us out of the very deep hole they themselves have\ndug in incurring unfunded liabilities of retirement and health care obligations—programs that are\nalready on the books but have not yet been paid for—that Pete Peterson‘s foundation calculates\nat $56 trillion and we at the Dallas Fed believe total over $99 trillion.8 If you do the numbers,\nyou will find that some 85 percent of those unfunded liabilities is due to Medicare; a budgetary\nHeimlich maneuver is urgently needed to keep Medicare from choking off our economic\nprosperity.\nWe are navigating uncharted, financially treacherous waters. Our fiscal authorities must carefully\nplot a course between the immediate needs for stimulus and the future needs of our children and\ngrandchildren.\nWhen George Shultz was director of the Office of Management and Budget, he became\nfrustrated with the spending impulses of the Nixon administration. He reports that he called the\nvenerable Sam Cohen, a virtual encyclopedia of budgetary history, into his office and asked,\n―Between you and me, Sam, is there really any difference between Republicans and Democrats\nwhen it comes to spending money?‖ Cohen‘s reply was classic: ―Sir, there is only one difference:\nDemocrats enjoy it more.‖\nMr. Cohen might have been a more ―equal opportunity‖ wisecracker were he still around. No\nmatter. We are beyond the point of either party‘s placing its immediate political needs ahead of\nthe welfare of our children and successor generations. I am hopeful that the good people that\nPresident Obama has assembled to guide his economic policy, and the leadership of the House\nand Senate, will begin to prevail on Congress to finally begin filling in the gaping holes of\nunfunded liabilities. In my eyes, these unfunded programs represent the greatest threat to our\nlong-term economic welfare and—given the historical temptation for politicians to ask central\nbanks to monetize their profligacy—the independence of the Federal Reserve. Left unattended,\nthese liabilities will surely tear asunder future American prosperity.\n\n7\n\n―Start Up the Risk-Takers,‖ by Thomas Friedman, New York Times, Feb. 22, 2009.\nFigures from the Dallas Fed cited in ―Storms on the Horizon,‖ by Richard W. Fisher, remarks before the\nCommonwealth Club of California, San Francisco, May 28, 2008. Figures from the Peterson Foundation cited in\n―Washington Must Heed Fiscal Alarm Bell,‖ by David Walker, Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Sept. 22, 2008.\n8\n\n8\n\n\fI trust Congress will get it right. And, in doing so, I trust that they—and you—will keep in mind\nboth the limited powers of the Federal Reserve and the vital importance of allowing us to apply\nour own judgment on how best to exercise those powers in furtherance of our mandate—a\nmandate to promote financial stability, maximize sustainable job creation and maintain price\nstability.\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress,\nthere is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this\nfirsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was\nbut one instance in a long history that stretches from the debauching of monetary probity in\nancient Rome to the inflation disaster that is now modern Zimbabwe.\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of\nFischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it,\nhe notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the\nReichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck‘s closest confidant, Gershon\nBleichröder, is reported to have ―warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when\npolitical considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too\nindependent a central bank would be a nuisance.‖9\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to\noverride what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany‘s central bank led to\nthe hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I\nbeg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the\nindependence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political\nconsiderations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe\nharbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal\nReserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its\nsingular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a ―nuisance,‖ so be it. The Fed under Paul\nVolcker‘s leadership was certainly a ―nuisance,‖ but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone\nalive today who would argue the fact that the Volcker Fed pulled the nation from the precipice of\neconomic calamity. It is important that the Federal Reserve be left to do its job and no more.\nHaving drawn that line in the sand, let me conclude by venturing an opinion on the business of\nour lawmakers: It is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism, including\ndisguised protectionism in the form of nontariff barriers, ―buy American‖ provisions and\nrestrictions on capital flows. What made the Great Depression ―great‖ was the Smoot–Hawley\nAct, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long\nDepression that began when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for\nmunicipal and residential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a\ncropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global\ndownturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the\naforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany‘s\n\n9\n\nLords of Finance, by Liaquat Ahamed, New York: Penguin, 2009, p. 88.\n9\n\n\ffree trade policy. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin\nHarrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform.\nI have been quoted as saying that protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics.10 It provides a\ntemporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death. Were I not a\ntaciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global\ngrowth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives,\nnewly elected chief executive and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the\ntemptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the\neconomic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying ―Have a nice day!‖ and walking off the stage.\nHowever, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another\nsourpuss. I am, as I said, paid to worry. But I am a red-blooded American, as are all my\ncolleagues at the Fed. I draw on the wisdom of Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the\nFederal Reserve from a period when our economy endured an even greater ―stress test.‖ To\ncounter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial\nindustry after the Crash of ‘29, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\nFirst, he said: ―You‘re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.‖\nSecond: ―You‘re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.‖\nThird: ―You‘re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the\ncountry.‖\nAnd fourth: ―You‘re right if you bet that (leaders) in business, labor, and government are sane,\nreasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground\namong all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that\nconfront them.‖\nThis became known as ―Old Doc Nadler‘s Remedy,‖ and for my part, it is spot on. Every one of\nus preoccupied with what ails us should keep it in mind.\nI conclude where I started, with wild dreams. It may seem like the stuff of the wildest dreams to\nimagine our getting ourselves out from our current nightmarish predicament. But I believe we\ncan and we will. We are Americans. I believe deep in my soul that when put to the test,\nAmericans rise to the occasion no matter how great the challenge. We have done it time and\nagain. We have no choice but to do it once more, now.\nI think I have said enough, if not too much. In the time-honored tradition of central bankers, I\nwould now be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\n10\n\nThe NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Feb. 2, 2009.\n10\n\n\f"

        "content": "The Fed’s Response to the Current\nEconomic Challenge (With References\nto Gershon Bleichröder and Central\nBank Independence)\nRemarks before CERAWeek\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nHouston, Texas\nFeb. 9, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Fed’s Response to the Current Economic Challenge\n(With References to Gershon Bleichröder and\nCentral Bank Independence)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Dan [Yergin]. It is a pleasure to be here at CERAWeek and especially to be here in\nHouston, the energy technology capitol of the world.\nA week ago tonight, I returned to Texas from Washington, following a two-day meeting of the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC), some public talks to warn against the dangers of\nprotectionism and finally a weekend of events surrounding the annual Alfalfa dinner.\nThe Alfalfa Club is an institution peculiar to Washington, D.C. Once a year, it holds a dinner\ndevoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongues firmly in cheek, its\nmembers nominate a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course,\nnone of them ever win and nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the\nStassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time,\nthen ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of this distinguished group—\nwhich in addition to Stassen has included my fellow Texans Jim Baker, Lloyd Bentsen, Robert\nStrauss, Jack Valenti, and both George Bush ‘41 and George Bush ‘43—is Veni, Vidi, Defici—―I\ncame, I saw, I lost.‖\nThis year‘s dinner was the first for President Obama, who at the time had been in office only 11\ndays. Alfalfans introduced Vernon Jordan as the candidate to head their ticket and challenge the\nreal president. Mr. Jordan appeared on stage in a stovepipe top hat. With a twinkle in his eye, he\naddressed President Obama and said, ―Mr. President, you may have noticed my hat. At the end\nof my announcement speech, I will pass it on to you. I must merely wear it. You must pull a\nrabbit out of it.‖\nCertainly concerning the economy, Jordan hit the nail on the head. The only description of recent\neconomic developments I have heard that is as cogent came from a woman who, having just\ncommiserated with her accountants, put it this way: ―This has been like the divorce from hell:\nMy net worth has been cut in half and I‘m still stuck with my husband.‖ The mood and pace of\nthe economy have shifted from near bliss to acrimony and an almost palpable sense of betrayal.\nOur self-confidence has gone wobbly. Many of our fellow citizens feel trapped in an\nunsustainable situation. The challenge facing the new president is daunting.\nOnly yesterday, it would have appeared to the naked eye that the economy was cruising along in\nthe most tranquil of seas. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter\nof economic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March of that year. And the\nstock market closed at an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the\nday at 1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing—most noticeably a\nheating up of headline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June\nof 2008. And there were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most\n\n1\n\n\fnoticeably in the housing market, but also on the balance sheets and income statements of major\ncreditors and various consumers. But to the unsuspecting world, all was well.\nIn 2008, conditions shifted radically. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not\nbelabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product\nis no longer growing, but shrank at an annualized pace of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008.\nBy my estimate, it is on pace to contract further throughout this year. Industrial production is\nfalling sharply; consumption is cascading downhill; demand has evaporated as businesses and\nconsumers alike pull in their horns and de-lever from excess indebtedness that fueled the prior\nboom. Unemployment has increased to 7.6 percent at the last reading and appears to me to be\nheaded in the direction of, and possibly past, 9 percent.\nBankers and other creditors, having noted that the horse long ago bolted from the confines of\nprudence, are now shutting the proverbial barn doors. The credit intermediation process has\nbecome dysfunctional. Once ubiquitous, credit has become quite expensive—if you can get it. As\nfor stocks, the S&P 500 Index closed today 44.4 percent off its October 2007 peak and has\nbecome historically and hysterically volatile.\nI will not venture to predict the behavioral future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market.\nBut I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with an unforgiving stock\nmarket and creditors that have become tighter than a new pair of shoes, businesses are doing\nwhat they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every\ncost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are addressing their cost of\nlabor by cutting ―head count.‖ They are delaying capital expenditures. They are demanding that\nsuppliers cut their prices and are tightening inventory management. They are watching their\nreceivables and stretching out their payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up\ntheir balance sheets. (One of my colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance\nsheets of consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and\nnothing on the right is right.)\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed,\nwe must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal\nReserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it\ngrew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of\nthe art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the\nsenior officers.\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men (and I hope, parenthetically, that President Obama makes full\nuse of his wisdom). Yet, I believe the following provides a more fulsome and insightful\ndescription of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly\ncaptures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n―Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when ‗the credit\nsystem‘ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard\nof; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly\nfrom the facility of borrowing.\n2\n\n\f―Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the\nbanks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade;\ngreat purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All,\nto be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid\ncapital....\n―Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and\ncredulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example\nof one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n―Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician,\nand the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No ‗operation‘ is thought worthy of\nattention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does\nnot promise an immediate fortune....\n―Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as\nshort as it is brilliant.‖1\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street\nJournal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Leon Hale in the Houston Chronicle. It was\nwritten by Washington Irving in his famous ―Crayon Papers‖ about the Mississippi Bubble\nfiasco of 1719.\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the\nother modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had\nnever heard of Bernie Madoff. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and\nwhat happens when what one old colleague called ―irrational exuberance‖ is replaced by\nirrational fear—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the ultimate\nenemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A\nfellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he would advise\nhis clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied ―cash and fetal.‖)\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no\nbusiness appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers\nand begins to weaken.\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\nWe could have let nature run its course. P. G. Wodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to\nsay that ―there is only one cure for gray hair. It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called the\nguillotine.‖ Or we could have just ignored it and mandated that it simply not be discussed, as the\nLatvian government did recently by decreeing that the Security Police arrest any economists who\nquestion the security of its banks or the value of its currency (the lat).\n\n1\n\n―A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,‖ by Washington Irving, in The Crayon Papers, 1890.\n3\n\n\fMy colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are red-blooded Americans. We refuse to be\nfatalistic. (Besides, those of us who have hair have seen it turn gray this past year.) Though in\nnormal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus of the human species, in times\nof distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine: We believe that good\nideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be\nbrought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\nLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the\neconomy‘s lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the early 19th century\nby two men named Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\nBagehot‘s prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: ―The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for its own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities\nof others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‗this man and that man‘ wherever\nthe security is good.‖\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its\ngovernor as follows: ―We lent by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted\nbefore; we took stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on those\nbills, we not only discounted outright but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange\nto an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the\nbank....‖2\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: ―It is by no\nmeans intended to imply that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress that\nthe rashness of bankers [and financiers] may bring upon themselves.... The relief should neither\nbe so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as\ndeeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by\nevery distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their\nstate.‖3\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate\nbetween the need to ―advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and\nmerchants, and ‗to this man and that man‘ whenever the security is good‖ and the equally\ncompelling need to fend off moral hazard of relieving ―those who misconduct their business,‖\nyou might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of\nrecent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours\nof the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the\ntheories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\nI recently read Ken Follett‘s magnificent book World Without End.4 It is a massive tome that\nruns for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black\n2\n\nLombard Street, by Walter Bagehot, 1825.\nAn Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, by Henry Thornton, 1802.\n4\nWorld Without End, by Ken Follett, New York: Penguin, 2007.\n3\n\n4\n\n\fPlague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the\nintelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists\nof ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to\nattend Oxford, so they learned from doing.5 While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old\northodoxy of studying the ―humors,‖ of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua\n(―Thy will be done‖), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The\npunch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the\nworst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and\nadapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\nWe at the Federal Reserve do not believe in the economic equivalent of ―fiat voluntas tua.‖ We\nbelieve in using our powers proactively. We have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then\nsome. We have been neither ―scanty nor slow‖ in addressing the pathology of our economy and\nfinancial system. We have ―lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the\nsafety of the bank.‖ And we have made abundantly clear that despite having reduced the target\nrange for the federal funds rate to the ―zero bound‖—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from\npursuing all practicable means available to a central bank in supporting the functioning of\nfinancial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state.\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient\ndebacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by\nother lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as\nthe Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the\nactions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to\ntheir banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12, 2007, when the base interest\nrate—the fed funds rate—was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing\naccess to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures\nin the system.\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We\nestablished a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to\nsecure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major\ntrading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco\nde México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those\nmarkets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the\nU.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain\nbanks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of\nthe financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new\nfacility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto\nloans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; and (8) at\nthe end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct\nobligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500\nbillion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae.\n\n5\n\nWhen I arrived at Oxford 650 years later, there were women studying there, but they were kept in separate colleges\nand were small in number. The joke among women then was ―Come to Oxford where the odds are good but the\ngoods are odd.‖\n5\n\n\fAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero\nand one-quarter of one percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the\ninflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and\nagain in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow\nfrom our ―discount window‖ so as to lower their cost of credit.\nAll of this has meant expanding our balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal\nReserve have expanded to $1.9 trillion—an almost twofold increase from when we started in\n2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even more should conditions\nwarrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of\nmortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed\npaper.\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our\nbalance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value\nof our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. We feel this is the correct side to\nemphasize. The right side of our balance sheet records our holdings of banks‘ balances, Federal\nReserve Bank notes or cash (currently over $830 billion) and U.S. Treasury balances.\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the right\nside of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash, only to find that accumulation\ndid too little to rejuvenate the system.\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between\ncash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their\nmoney. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and allimportant private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to\naffordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to\nimprove the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In\nthe parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to\n―quantitative easing.‖ It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese\ncounterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others‘ unsuccessful attempts at\ncuring the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, short-term Treasuries\nas assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised\na few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton\nFriedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devises his protagonist, the felicitously\nnamed Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn\nto Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein,\nit was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B),\nthereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting\nperch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens\nand lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut\nstring (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby\nwiping face.\n6\n\n\fI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter\nBagehot or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex,\ntrying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation‘s central bank and we are duty\nbound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial\nsystem and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men\nand women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform\ntheir duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\nTo be sure, we have to be very careful in deploying our arsenal. For example, we are well aware\nthat the issuance of new Treasuries is expanding at an eye-popping pace: Net new issuance of\nTreasuries was $145 billion in fiscal year 2007, expanded to $788 billion in fiscal year 2008 and,\naccording to this morning‘s Financial Times, will broach $2 trillion in fiscal year 2009.6 This\n―guesstimation‖ is based on the pace of issuance in the first five months of this fiscal year and an\n$800 billion price tag for the expected fiscal stimulus package (but before a net cost is assigned\nto the bank proposals that will be forthcoming from the Treasury). The Federal Reserve must, of\ncourse, be very careful to avoid the perception that it is monetizing the explosion of fiscal\ndeficits, as this would undermine confidence in our independence and raise serious doubts about\nour long-term commitment to price stability. This does not mean, however, that we should\nrefrain from buying Treasuries in this time of crisis. Similarly, we must be very cautious about\nthe dimensions of our program to intervene directly in the market for asset-backed securities,\nmaking sure that our actions are, literally, the least we must do and no more. Most important of\nall, we must continue to make clear that we will unwind our interventions in the market and\nshrink our balance sheet back to normal proportions once our task is accomplished, for this is,\nindeed, our unanimous and unflinching intention.\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun\nto work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym LIBOR, has\ncome down handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages\nthat will be reset in the immediate future are based on LIBOR. Our purchase of governmentsponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities initially reduced the interest rate on 30year, fixed-rate mortgages to 5.19 percent, a record low, according to Freddie Mac data that start\nin 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer term Treasuries has\nrisen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund\nfacilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the\nA1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has\nalso not escaped my attention that the premium over Treasuries that investment-grade\ncorporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined by 20 percent and by 26 percent for\nnon-investment-grade borrowers.\nDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed\nto restore the nation‘s economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and\nspending the American people‘s money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes are\non the stimulus package being hammered out in the Senate, and, then, in conference with the\n6\n\n―Fed Home Loan Purchases Fail to Keep Mortgage Rates from Rising,‖ Financial Times, Feb. 9, 2009.\n7\n\n\fHouse of Representatives. This is no easy task. Our senators and congressmen and -women must\nfind a way to give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without encumbering or\ndisincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term economic miracle\nthat is America. Simultaneously, they must agree to the funding and structure of a revamped\nbanking system. And, on top of all that, they must begin, now, to dig us out of the very deep hole\nthey themselves have dug in incurring unfunded liabilities of retirement and health care\nobligations—programs that are already on the books but have not yet been paid for—that Pete\nPeterson‘s foundation calculates at $53 trillion and we at the Dallas Fed believe totals over $99\ntrillion.7\nWe are navigating uncharted, financially treacherous waters. Our fiscal authorities must carefully\nplot a course between the immediate needs for stimulus and the future needs of our children and\ngrandchildren.\nI trust the Congress will get it right. And, I should add, I hope that they—and you—continue to\nbear in mind the limited powers of the Federal Reserve. I believe it vitally important that the\nFederal Reserve must be left alone to independently craft policies using those powers, based\nsolely on our best judgment as to what is needed to achieve financial stability and conduct\nmonetary policy aimed at maximizing sustainable job creation without upsetting price stability.\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress,\nthere is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this\nfirsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was\nbut one instance in history.\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of\nFischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it,\nhe notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the\nReichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck‘s closest confidant, Gershon\nBleichröder, is reported to have ―warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when\npolitical considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too\nindependent a central bank would be a nuisance.‖8\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to\noverride what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany‘s central bank led to\nthe hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I\nbeg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the\nindependence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political\nconsiderations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe\nharbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal\nReserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its\nsingular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a ―nuisance,‖ so be it. It is important that we be\nleft to do our job and no more.\n7\n\nFigures from the Dallas Fed cited in ―Storms on the Horizon,‖ by Richard W. Fisher, remarks before the\nCommonwealth Club of California, San Francisco, May 28, 2008. Figures from the Peterson Foundation cited in\n―Washington Must Heed Fiscal Alarm Bell,‖ by David Walker, Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Sept. 22, 2008.\n8\nLords of Finance, by Liaquat Ahamed, New York: Penguin, 2009, p. 88.\n8\n\n\fHaving ventured into fiscal matters, let me conclude with another comment on the stimulus\npackage being debated within the legislative branch. Whatever our elected officials decide to do,\nit is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism. What made the Great Depression\n―great‖ was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may\nbe less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending\ninstitutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of\nVienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global\ndownturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the\naforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany‘s\nfree trade policy. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin\nHarrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform.\nI have been quoted as saying that ―protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics. It provides a\ntemporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death.‖ 9 Were I not a\ntaciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global\ngrowth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives,\nnewly elected commander-in-chief and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the\ntemptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the\neconomic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\nThank you for bearing with me. I think I have said enough, if not too much. In the time-honored\ntradition of central bankers, I would now be happy to avoid answering any questions you might\nhave.\n\n9\n\nInterview on C-SPAN‘s Washington Journal, Feb. 2, 2009.\n9\n\n\f"
